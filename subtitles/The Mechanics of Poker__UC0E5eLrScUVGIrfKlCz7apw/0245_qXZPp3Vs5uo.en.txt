[00:00]
I play against theoretically stronger
players than myself all the time, right?
Like it's not my full-time thing, but I
still like to compete. So, I got to find
innovative ways um staying competitive.
One of those is what are they not paying
attention to? Bill over here is [ __ ]

[00:15]
attention to? Bill over here is [ __ ]
stupid. He still haven't gotten his
coffee. In his mind, he's like, "If I
don't get my coffee, I'm going to shove
any." Today, we will be chatting with
high stakes MT player and entrepreneur
Anon Wig. Anton has been around in poker

[00:30]
Anon Wig. Anton has been around in poker
for over 17 years and contributes his
longevity to a neverending curiosity
towards improving and performance. I
would leverage AI in my quest for
becoming a better and more independent
learner. Use the minimum amount of

[00:46]
learner. Use the minimum amount of
resources to get the maximum amount of
output or result. That's of course going
to be natural selection. And I think
we're already seeing that. If you would
like map out the poker ecosystem and see
who's winning and who's losing and why
and like do a deeper dive analysis

[01:01]
and like do a deeper dive analysis
there, you're probably going to realize
that the people that are more curious,
more actionoriented,
more solutions oriented, maybe
solutionsoriented is better than action
or like they're more solutions oriented
and then like they take action, they're
going to be the big winners in the pool.

[01:16]
going to be the big winners in the pool.
And when I realized that, oh my god,
like I'm an infinite pool almost highly
interesting people and every day is kind
of like this raffle. Like who am I going
to get today? What I'm hearing is like I
don't find it intellectually stimulating

[01:30]
don't find it intellectually stimulating
to beat a player that's worse than I.
And I said I should be so pissed right
now because everything is going to [ __ ]
and I should go punch that punching bag.
And the punching bag was looking back at
me and saying like, "Yeah, but you don't
got [ __ ]

[01:47]

Without further ado, guys, enjoy this
episode. All right, Anton, thank you for
joining us on the podcast.

[02:15]
joining us on the podcast.
Thanks, man. Anton, I saw Poker Stars
gave you the nickname the Poker
Terminator. I was wondering if uh if
that stickked or is there another
nickname you go by or can we just call
you Anton? Uh I mean like it kind of it

[02:30]
you Anton? Uh I mean like it kind of it
kind of works, right? But I think it's
like too long to to be um an actual
nickname for for like a pet name. But my
assistants, they built my second brain
and they put up the the poker stars
video of me as the Terminator. So they
are trying to turn me into a cyborg.

[02:47]
are trying to turn me into a cyborg.
I do really like it. That has to be said
like especially in the clip how they
made you look. It really looked like a
cyborg, you know? Uh got some Arnold
Schwarzenegger vibes going on there. Uh
Anthony, I was digging into your story
uh and a few things stood out to me

[03:01]
uh and a few things stood out to me
straight away. You started playing poker
at just 15 years old, you know, not not
not the age that most people start. Uh
before that, you were already quite the
competitor as well. I saw you played ice
hockey, football, and even were
competitive in chess. Uh we're going to

[03:17]
competitive in chess. Uh we're going to
dive in all of that, but before that,
I'd actually like to start with your
education. uh because instead of
following the mainstream educational
system you were taught in a Waldorf
school which follows the educational
philosophy of Rudolph Steiner for those

[03:31]
philosophy of Rudolph Steiner for those
who are unfamiliar. This system
emphasizes on creativity, holistic
development and experimental learning
over traditional academic structures.
Could you maybe give us some insights
into how that kind of education shaped

[03:46]
into how that kind of education shaped
you and more specifically how it's
influenced the way you approach poker?
Yeah, that was nice. Yeah, number one,
you did your homework, I see. So, that's
cool. Um,
yeah. So,

[04:02]
yeah. So,
I think they, you know, they got me
early, which is which is which is good.
Um, I think I think it's um, as a kid,
you just you just do stuff. Um, you just
like go about your life and nothing

[04:15]
like go about your life and nothing
really is uh um, you don't understand
how how different it might be. Uh but
then as I grew up, I started realizing
that my friends from other schools, they
were thinking differently. I think that
was the big kind of like aha moment for

[04:30]
was the big kind of like aha moment for
me. And in the beginning when you're a
kid, that's not what you want, right?
Like you're like, I'm I'm different.
Like how am I going to fit in? But as
the years have passed, I I have a large
enough body of evidence to see that the
people that I used to go to school with

[04:45]
people that I used to go to school with
as well that they do, I would say on
average more creative jobs, that they're
they're more freethinkers
um and that they kind of define success
in a in a different way than than the
traditional kind of system would would

[05:02]
traditional kind of system would would
quantify that. Um so I think that's a
good introduction to to education. And
then there are things that are amazing
with that kind of education just as in
as in regular education as well. So I
think it has some pros and cons. Um yeah

[05:17]
think it has some pros and cons. Um yeah
that's that's the my experience of of
being a Waldorf child. Yeah. How how old
were you like in this period?
So my parents actually moved to to this

[05:30]
So my parents actually moved to to this
place Y in Sweden where where there they
have a large community. So they moved
there when I was one one year and then
they put me in regular preschool. I went
there until I was 6 years old and then
in uh six uh when when you're six we do

[05:45]
in uh six uh when when you're six we do
like preschool. Uh so that's when I got
started and uh my experience coming from
the regular system to the warf system
was I went to this preschool. This is my
first day at preschool and I'm there
with my parents and it's all I'm

[06:00]
with my parents and it's all I'm
wandering around. I'm touching this
stuff. I'm seeing how it is. And at some
point, I pull my parents aside. Like,
I'm I'm I literally pull them in under
this like spiral staircase. So, I'm

[06:15]
this like spiral staircase. So, I'm
there, you know, like six-year-old me.
And I'm just like pulling like, "Mom,
mom, dad, come here. Come here." Like,
they lean in under the staircase
and I say, "This is a really poor
kindergarten, isn't it?" Like, they
don't have any real toys. like

[06:31]
don't have any real toys. like
everything is like wood.
So, so that was my uh perception and I
think it took me a while to to kind of
get used to uh you know not having
plastic toys and not having the same

[06:46]
plastic toys and not having the same
thing as I was used to and I kind of I
think I have that also um perspective of
going back and forth. I only went to
Walof school for 9 years and then I went
back to the traditional education system
where I took business football for

[07:00]
where I took business football for
soccer for for 3 years for American
listeners
actually football. Um so yeah I studied
studied football for um 3 years. Um so I
got a little bit of you know little bit
of both like popping back and forth and

[07:16]
of both like popping back and forth and
seeing what I like and what I don't like
and what I could take from it and uh
what I can get back as well of course.
You mentioned that you noticed that you
you were thinking different from from
from the other kids and even you know
later in life you see that around you

[07:31]
later in life you see that around you
with the kids you went to that school
with that they have a different way of
viewing life right they got attracted to
different type of jobs.
How do you think or what kind of think
you what kind of impact does it have on
poker if you compare how you think about

[07:47]
poker if you compare how you think about
poker or think about poker strategy or
studying poker compared to your peers?
Let me go let me go back one step first
and then then we'll get to the second
part of that question. So I think

[08:04]
part of that question. So I think
how we got to learn was very hands-on,
right? Like it's not here is a candle,
light it and let it burn. Here is like
here's how you make a candle

[08:16]
here's how you make a candle
so that you know the components of it.
Like here or a better example might be
um instead of here's a book, you should
read it and learn from it. It's like
here's a story, here's a crate, here's a

[08:30]
here's a story, here's a crate, here's a
paper, now follow along and create your
own story, right? Like so I think that's
the big shift. It's more like
turning you into the narrator instead of
just a recipient of information.

[08:45]
just a recipient of information.
uh or you know like if you want to work
with your hands do that practically
speaking and learn by doing instead of
like you know becoming an engineer and
working in theory perhaps uh you start
with a hands-on part of that process and

[09:01]
with a hands-on part of that process and
then you move to to the more theoretical
side which I think is
um
pretty fun there's a pretty big shift
fundamentally right
um so I think that's like the

[09:16]
um so I think that's like the
that's the introduction. Um,
and if you could repeat the the actual
question so I I'll get in in line with
uh what the question was. How you
noticed that this was different in poker

[09:32]
noticed that this was different in poker
compared to like your other your other
colleagues,
right? So
for the other side um from the poker
perspective um
I think the best way to put put it is in

[09:47]
I think the best way to put put it is in
systems thinking terms. When I think
about poker I think about
what I think is a very good way of
starting anything is first principles
like it's kind of overused and tossed
around. And everyone is talking about

[10:01]
around. And everyone is talking about
first principles this and that. But
fundamentally system like that is the
number one thing that you do to start
something. For those who are not
familiar systems thinking in a very like
small nutshell is to use the minimum

[10:16]
small nutshell is to use the minimum
amount of resources to get the maximum
amount uh of output or result.
Um, so then what I try to do from a
systems thinking point of view is to
then think laterally, right? Like you're

[10:31]
then think laterally, right? Like you're
thinking that you could solve a problem,
but if you're only stuck in the past and
taking up old ideas and try to solve it
from that perspective, you're limiting
your
imagination.

[10:45]
imagination.
So I mean you can take an example like
uh something very present is robotics.
So like if you would train a robot, you
would have to do it in previously you
would have to do it in physical reality
because we didn't have strong enough
tools to model the laws of physics which

[11:03]
tools to model the laws of physics which
is going back to first principles is
like a very fundamental thing. Uh you
can't that's the only law that you can't
break. You have to abide by physics. But
now that you can simulate that

[11:15]
now that you can simulate that
accurately in a digital environment,
what you can then do is you can run
infinite simulations. You can train your
robot so when it comes off the
production line in physical reality,
it's already pre-trained to do all those
things. And I think that's like the

[11:30]
things. And I think that's like the
coolest thing ever. Like every time I
think about how profoundly
epic that is, I think about number one,
like that's super super cool. and it
pushes progress fast forward in a really

[11:45]
pushes progress fast forward in a really
like super speed way. And for those who
watch Westworld, there's a there's a
little nugget in there for you as well.
If you finish the five seasons of
Westworld, it's like one of the shows I
rate the highest ever. Um that it has to

[12:00]
rate the highest ever. Um that it has to
do with the nature of reality and how
we're creating these digital
environments, you know, that that we
never had access to. And that's a that's
a big big big shift that I think people
are really um get people are used just
getting used to it.

[12:15]
getting used to it.
You mentioned uh these systems are built
around uh wasting the minimum amount of
energy to get the maximum amount of um
output. How or like the maximum results?
If you put that in like poker terms,

[12:32]
If you put that in like poker terms,
could you maybe give an example of that?
It's a good that's a good question. I
think a good way of of putting it would
be I think people think about this from

[12:45]
be I think people think about this from
a from a perspective of what should I
study. Uh like you know uh there's a
heat like you can create a heat map of
the most common spots that that you
should that you play most often and then
you drill those. Um, I think that's a

[13:00]
you drill those. Um, I think that's a
that's a
good way of um of thinking about poker,
but I think the the bigger picture, if I
would think about it from a first
principle point of view, is that I'm
going to be there and I'm going to
execute and I need to execute

[13:16]
execute and I need to execute
consistently over a long period of time.
So now the bigger cost could be how do I
retain this knowledge as fast and drill
and retain this knowledge as fast as
possible so I don't lose it, right? Like

[13:30]
possible so I don't lose it, right? Like
because the aim here is maximum output,
right? Like you want to be able to
execute this thing over and over again.
You might want to have a system in place
as well that kind of like checks that
and and has a look into

[13:45]
and and has a look into
um are trends changing? Do I need to
make adjustments in my strategy? Uh is
that something that um needs to happen?
Because if not, you're executing a
faulty strategy. But the retention side,
I mean, unless you you're programming a
bot, the bot will always execute

[14:01]
bot, the bot will always execute
perfectly uh given the parameters you
give it. But as a human, we have a
tendency to just forget information. And
so from a first principles point of
view, it would be like how can I study
the right things? How can I use the

[14:16]
the right things? How can I use the
minimum amount of time and resources to
craft the best type of strategies to
exploit you know the general population
and then exploit uh different types of
opponents then how do I

[14:32]
opponents then how do I
simulate that in such a way that I can
train it train myself to execute it and
then make sure that I don't forget it so
that I can safely move on to the next
thing. um and kind of keep building my

[14:46]
thing. um and kind of keep building my
performance in that way and that that
circle kind of repeats itself with every
spot. Do you have maybe any I I know
that this is a very big issue a lot of
people have, right? We can study a lot
and we take a lot of notes, we gather

[15:00]
and we take a lot of notes, we gather
all this info, right? But we kind of
fail to put it together in a way that we
can actually memorize this knowledge,
right? Something that you mentioned, do
you maybe have some tips for our
audience on how to better retain the
knowledge of of like the things that

[15:16]
knowledge of of like the things that
you've studied? Maybe something that
you've experimented with over your
career? Yeah, of course. I mean like
I I will I will do one better. Uh I will
give people the tools that they can can
access to so that they can search for

[15:31]
access to so that they can search for
this information themselves. I think
that's just like I mean my job like just
also as an introduction I'm an
entrepreneur and we what we as
entrepreneurs try to do is solve
people's problems and my way of
approaching that is giving people access

[15:45]
approaching that is giving people access
to tools systems solutions
uh that I want for them to practically
use to to kind of solve problems for
themselves. I think that's that's a
that's a biggest gift that I can
provide. So how I would go about uh

[16:03]
provide. So how I would go about uh
looking into this is
I would leverage AI, you know, like I
would leverage AI in my quest for
becoming a better and more independent
learner. And how would I do that? Well,

[16:17]
learner. And how would I do that? Well,
I would go to I probably start in an app
like Perplexity. Uh I think it's an
excellent like very lightweight tool to
ask relevant questions. Uh I don't know
if you're familiar with what perplexity

[16:30]
if you're familiar with what perplexity
is. No say could you maybe elaborate
like what what it does you know in the
chatpt but further than that uh
yeah I would I would love to I mean like
I'm this I'm don't worry I'm not
sponsored by Perplexity uh I'm powered
by Perplexity but I I love this tool. I

[16:47]
by Perplexity but I I love this tool. I
think it's um it's something that I use
on a daily basis. So perplexity is
I guess for context like think about it
as a comparison to Google search engine.

[17:00]
as a comparison to Google search engine.
So like Google search engine you enter a
query you get a result there's some ads
whatever right like
um
the way perplexity is designed is that
instead of being a search engine is an

[17:15]
instead of being a search engine is an
answer engine. So you insert your
question and it will spit out an answer
and this answer is based on
the most relevant information. So it's

[17:30]
the most relevant information. So it's
like sourcing all the
different uh it's like finding all the
different sources on the internet and
then it's categorizing that and giving
you the best source of information. What
you can then do is subcategorize like do
I want to see this as an academic paper?

[17:45]
I want to see this as an academic paper?
Do I want to see it from social media?
Because you know, you might want to
source your answers if you want to find
a underground club in Berlin, you might
not want to go to like the uh you know
the academic side of things like you
want to you want to actually find like
some uh blogs and and places where where

[18:02]
some uh blogs and and places where where
people are writing about their
experiences.
Um then that's that's one side. Um, what
it also does is
it gives you a set of follow-up

[18:16]
it gives you a set of follow-up
questions. So, it acts as a co-pilot
where it tells you,
you know, maybe your first question
wasn't the actual question you wanted to
ask. Pretty common, right? We have a
like my question wasn't really sharp
enough to to hit the point. the co-pilot

[18:32]
enough to to hit the point. the co-pilot
is there to kind of guide you into
asking here are five follow-ups that
would be the most relevant follow-ups to
your question. So, it's kind of like was
this what you meant? Was this what you
meant? Was this what you meant? And

[18:45]
meant? Was this what you meant? And
that's also a superpower because now you
can do this like 8020 8020 8020 like
start with silly question and then end
up with like profound insight in less
than 5 minutes. Uh, so I think like that
that's also

[19:01]
that's also
I'm a big advocate for these things
because I think they're very
educational. I think like knowledge and
curiosity are these
uh things that go hand in hand. And once
you can use modern technology and kind
of summon knowledge at your fingertips,

[19:17]
of summon knowledge at your fingertips,
I think that's epic. Uh there's a pro
feature as well where say you know you
would be listening to this conversation
and I say something like systems
thinking and first principles you don't
know what it is what you can do is you

[19:30]
know what it is what you can do is you
can say hey tell me about systems
thinking tell me about first uh first
principles think tell me about lateral
thinking and what it will do is it will
source that it will give you a short
explanation and in the pro feature you
can press convert into page which turns

[19:46]
can press convert into page which turns
it into a presentation
So you now have a live web page of all
the things that we talked about and you
can think you know the use cases for say
academia you're in a class and you want
to like know what the professor is

[20:00]
to like know what the professor is
talking about but you're there and it's
kind of abstract you listen to this guy
and some guy sent you a meme
you know like now you have your keynotes
and you don't have to go to a smart
person in the class like it's always

[20:15]
person in the class like it's always
like kind of embarrassing like hey could
I get your notes because I wasn't really
like that good at taking them down. Now
you have your own assistant there that
will help you to craft presentations
which goes back to the the memory aspect
of things, right? Like with now you can

[20:31]
of things, right? Like with now you can
start retaining things because you can
pin
that presentation off of the actual
information which means that your
short-term memory then like logs it
faster and goes into your memory bag.
You can also take that presentation of

[20:46]
You can also take that presentation of
course export it. So we're staying on
point. You can export it into you know
the old school tool would be Anki but
now like how can you find a Anky like
tool that helps doing this more

[21:00]
tool that helps doing this more
efficiently. So like we're also sticking
to first principles like how can I use
like what would be my process of taking
like my poker study and then um

[21:15]
like my poker study and then um
extrapolating what I need and then
exporting those automatically. Can I set
up an automation maybe? Right? like is
that a thing that would actually take me
a lot of time that I don't need to do as
a human so that I can get my debt
prepared faster so I can study faster so

[21:32]
prepared faster so I can study faster so
I can retain information faster so I can
focus on you know maybe refining work
elsewhere looking into a mass database
analysis trend over there but like we
find ourselves

[21:45]
find ourselves
constantly distracted and I'm I'm the
same I don't trust my brain right like
my brain is just like, oo, shiny object.
And I'm just like, well, I guess we got
to go look at the shiny object. And then
like 3 hours later, I'm not doing what
I'm supposed to be doing. And I think

[22:01]
I'm supposed to be doing. And I think
that's also like quite a significant
cost. So, you know, my advice to
everyone is go find out. You don't need
even like a nonformal education. As long
as you have access to a cell phone and a

[22:15]
as you have access to a cell phone and a
solid internet line, you can essentially
do anything you want.
So basically we shouldn't ask Anton but
we should ask perplexity. That's kind of
the conclusion. That's the hashtag ask
perplexity. To be fair I do find myself
nowadays I might ask something or to
some like oh wait I can just ask

[22:31]
some like oh wait I can just ask
anything to AI right because it will
give me usually usually the best
answers. Uh I get I I assume that you're
u you're going to be first in line to
let yourself get chipped AI by Neurolink
of Elon Musk. Like yeah you know take

[22:46]
of Elon Musk. Like yeah you know take
that part of my brain. I don't trust my
brain. Put a little AI chip in there.
Actually, I I'll go with the with the
with the other um I I will actually
challenge two things that you said. Uh I
will challenge the first thing is

[23:05]
from a point of view of learning and
learning new information.
I think it's largely depends on what
kind of personality you are. For me, I
really really like for me it fires me up

[23:16]
really really like for me it fires me up
working with people, talking to people,
learning from people. Uh, and I'm an I'm
like extremely extroverted as a person
that gives me a lot of energy. Um,
so I think that's the first thing to
like ask yourself, you know, like what

[23:31]
like ask yourself, you know, like what
gives me um what gets me motivated and
what gets me fired up because you're
going to be a much better learner. Like
think about having that boring class and
you're sitting at the back of the
classroom chewing your chewing gum and
like how much did you learn from any of

[23:45]
like how much did you learn from any of
those classes? I can't recite one single
thing versus that class you have with
that amazing English teacher that I
still remember her name and and she is
like got me so fired up about English
that I'm still on that learning path. So
I think that there's a big question to

[24:01]
I think that there's a big question to
ask yourself as a human like what is my
uh preference and where do I find my
edge and what I want what creates value
for me like you know value is not as
much as you would think it's money when

[24:15]
much as you would think it's money when
you need it it's not it right like
science is very very clear on that once
you make enough money you have to
redefine that because it's no longer
your number one priority to put food on
the table and have a nice place to
money is a tool at the end of the day

[24:32]
money is a tool at the end of the day
and that's a luxury for me to be able to
say that. Uh but I really want to make
sure that
um
I think I think there's a choice to be
made and I think it's for everyone like
if you're more of a introverted person

[24:46]
if you're more of a introverted person
and that gives you more energy and more
focus I think you should go for it. I
think you should just ask the AI and you
can be there and converse with it and
it's going to be very like private and
intimate. it's almost going to be like
hurt for those who've seen that movie.

[25:00]
hurt for those who've seen that movie.
Um,
so yeah, I think that's like the big
caveat. Make it make it work for you.
Uh, and then when it comes to the
implant in the brain, um, I'm not going
to lie, I was a little like intrigued

[25:15]
to lie, I was a little like intrigued
like but I also like equally scared like
I don't want to be hacked. Like think
about like I I just think about an
outcome. So like my biggest fear I think
like physical fear would be to be
tortured, right? Like that that would be

[25:30]
tortured, right? Like that that would be
like one of those things. And I don't
know if you've seen Black Mirror, but
like there's that episode where he gets
into prison and he gets to spend like an
eternal time in his like private hell
type of thing. I I I think I missed that
episode. Oh, it's so

[25:45]
episode. Oh, it's so
it's so good. But like now I imagine if
someone could control me in that way, my
actual like I wouldn't be a simulation.
I would actually have to like have that
felt experience. Um and that's a risk
that I wouldn't be willing to take. Like

[26:00]
that I wouldn't be willing to take. Like
I I just like my
um I don't want to be cipher in in
Matrix, right? Like I just like reality
too much uh to to ever have that being a
negotiation for me.
Um,

[26:15]
Um,
so I think that there that would be a
risk that I wouldn't take. And there's
also now new tools. Uh, like I there's I
saw this demo with uh Mark Zuckerberg
where he's kind of showing this new

[26:30]
where he's kind of showing this new
thing that you so you put it on your
arm. It's like a it looks like a
wristband, like a pretty like robust
wristband. Uh like an Avengers type of
thing.
And the demo they had is that there's
two people and they're sitting in a room
and they're playing this like Sonish the

[26:46]
and they're playing this like Sonish the
Hedgehog type of game where
uh your aim is to like you're just going
to go like left, right, left, right,
left, right, and the thing is running
forward fast like fast in a straight
line and you're just trying to like

[27:00]
line and you're just trying to like
dodge the the things that you could run
into and you do that by kind of tilting
your arm. So like that's how they
started kind of like training this thing
for to see what is it what are you doing
like how do you how does your brain work
then there's an algorithmic layer that

[27:17]
then there's an algorithmic layer that
attaches to this process that through
these like tiny nerve endings in your
arm it's starting to understand kind of
like how you guide your decision making
process and over time it starts reading

[27:32]
process and over time it starts reading
your mind right like so through the fist
shoot through your physical arm. I know
I'm getting boost bumps every time I
think about how
big that innovation is because now you
don't have the problem anymore, right?

[27:46]
don't have the problem anymore, right?
Like if you match that with say I mean
AR glasses are still ugly and and chunky
and we don't want to really have them.
Like now you see the future where we're
kind of in this
um

[28:01]
um
future where you where you can have a
hologram and you can do stuff with your
arms, right? It's like the sci-fi
version of this. And to you, that's
going to be you're now augmented virtual
slash reality reality. And and I think

[28:17]
slash reality reality. And and I think
that also kind of shows you a little bit
where we are in in that process
currently and why it's hard to get for
people to get used to it cuz they see it
as sci-fi. But when you see that the
tools are there and it works, it's not

[28:31]
tools are there and it works, it's not
sci-fi anymore. And I think that's
something that we, you know, the sooner
we get used to that and accept that
fact, the more effective we can be in
crafting solutions and staying ahead of
the competition or building something uh
innovate, right? like whatever it is

[28:45]
innovate, right? like whatever it is
that you want to do,
you're not going to or get a job, you
know, like you're not going to get a job
um
at a construction company uh making a
foundation for a house if you don't have

[29:02]
foundation for a house if you don't have
a driver's license so you can drive a
concrete truck. If you bring like a
shovel to that meeting, they're just
going to say, "I'm sorry, buddy, but
like we can't hire you." Right? And and
things have always evolved that way.
this time is just bigger because because

[29:15]
this time is just bigger because because
it's in a different reality that we've
created and Yeah. Yeah. And it will take
probably a step like go from the shovel
to the machine was kind of something
that you could see coming. But I feel
like right now in the future, especially
with AI, we have no [ __ ] idea what

[29:30]
with AI, we have no [ __ ] idea what
like the next step is going to be. It's
very hard to envision and therefore
prepare for it. So basically in the near
future, we might have this podcast
hologram form, right? We're just all,
you know, surrounded by each other all
like hologram. I see like some get like
some Star Wars pictures. I I know you

[29:45]
some Star Wars pictures. I I know you
know we start talk a lot about AI. I
know that you spend a lot of the time
that you don't spend on poker, right?
You spend a lot in AI. Uh how do you see
like AI's impact
on the poker industry?

[30:00]
on the poker industry?
Hello.
I will I will I will I will do my
favorite thing. I will first turn that
question around to you. I'm not trying
to evade uh answering this this question
quickly, but I think it's also

[30:15]
quickly, but I think it's also
interesting to hear someone else's point
of view because of course I have my um
kind of like hot take on this from from
the other side. But why I'm asking the
question is because I haven't been that

[30:30]
question is because I haven't been that
deeply integrated into poker in some
time because I've been busy building my
company like building my business and
learning as much as I can as fast as I
can. Uh so I think it's more interesting
to hear kind of what your take off and
and I'll see if I can ping off that

[30:45]
and I'll see if I can ping off that
conversation.
To be honest, I haven't put given this
too much thought, but if I in terms of
how it apply AI specifically applies to
poker, but I would say if I just zoom
out a bit of further just in general
life, I feel like with AI, just like

[31:01]
life, I feel like with AI, just like
with all new technology, there's going
to be pros and cons and we're constantly
going to be recalibrating, right? We
went too far to the left, we over
applied things, then we go too far to
the right. But I believe that let's say
within 50 years from now, I think at at

[31:17]
within 50 years from now, I think at at
the end it will be for the better. Okay.
I hope that AI like the only thing that
I'm concerned of because like we don't
really know what we truly want, right?
What we think we want is not really what

[31:30]
What we think we want is not really what
we want. So if AI starts to think that
what we want is what we think we want,
but it's actually not really what we
want, he can stare us in the completely
wrong direction, right? If you still
follow what I mean. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I
I mean I mean I I hear you. Um but I

[31:45]
I mean I mean I I hear you. Um but I
think it's also like interesting for me
to hear like how do you if you would
just pick one thing like how do you
think it would be um you know changing
your workflow for instance like how you
you operate with um putting out content

[32:01]
you operate with um putting out content
about or like how how you structure your
study plan like maybe you know because
not everyone is a content like think
about something that
uh your audience would be doing right
like everyone has to study to to improve
their skills. So like what part of your

[32:16]
their skills. So like what part of your
workflow do you find takes a lot of time
and and where where are the areas where
you currently feel like you're not being
very effective but you think it would
have a high alpha?

[32:31]
have a high alpha?
Well, I mean, I can already see that in
my current workflow, right? With the
limited tools or at least with the
versions of AI that's now publicly
available, let's say for example, chat
GPT, I can imagine that maybe five or 10
years from now, we look at ChatG now and

[32:45]
years from now, we look at ChatG now and
we kind of laugh at it, right? Uh like,
oh, were that the tools we used to work
with? But I already found it like
probably working with there's no no day
goes by that I don't open it, that I
don't use it. If sometimes it's down,
I'm like, [ __ ] I cannot work. you know

[33:00]
I'm like, [ __ ] I cannot work. you know
it's like because for example with all
content that I make uh think help help
for example preparing these type of
podcast I just write down notes I don't
have to be accurate because I know that
afterwards I'm just going to throw it in
chat GPT and he will do the outlining
for me and then I will get it back and

[33:15]
for me and then I will get it back and
then I will continue on that I will send
it back and then it's a nice back and
forth right um so it's already helping
me a lot as like
yeah
as how can I say like basically
a partner, right, that I get that I get

[33:31]
a partner, right, that I get that I get
feedback for. I always ask for feedback
like, "Hey, what do you think of this?
Hey, what do you think of that?" And
like lately, for example, if I look at
my CH GPT, I have a bunch of files and
I've assigned it a bunch of roles. For
example, I have a I have a a young

[33:46]
example, I have a I have a a young
daughter one and a half years old. Uh I
have a folder where I've put it together
all the experts, okay, of of of people
in babies and stuff. gave him the role,
gave him all the information say hey I
want you to take all the knowledge of

[34:00]
want you to take all the knowledge of
these experts in these fields because
you know these are the guys that I that
I adopted so when I have like I don't
know how to do with the situation with
my child I go to my it's called
parenting panel uh and I ask it there
right and then he gives me like oh from
the philosophy of this specialist you

[34:15]
the philosophy of this specialist you
know uh they say you should take this
approach and they basically I now have
that for everything so for example in
our business uh think marketing sales
etc I just have folders for everything
ring rules attached to everyone
copywriters and I feel like it's it's a
matter of the input that you give for

[34:31]
matter of the input that you give for
example if I ask JGP oh what are poker
players struggling with the answer is
going to be quite broad and vague
whereas for example I have a lot of data
for example people apply to our programs
they leave information about their
struggles their desires so I can get a

[34:46]
struggles their desires so I can get a
very narrow view of my specific niche if
I feed them that information if I feed
them all the information say hey this is
going to be your role I'm going to now
feed you all the information that that
you need to of my customer and you give
him all this information and then I ask
him can you maybe explain to me what my

[35:01]
him can you maybe explain to me what my
customer is and then he explains it and
then from there you're going to start
asking him to help you with your sales
space helped you with your marketing
pitch and it's not perfect like people
some some people are a bit impatient
like a [ __ ] what I got no you have to
take it and they're like huh I do like

[35:16]
take it and they're like huh I do like
that I'm I'm going to take that and I'm
going to you know it's it will not give
you the perfect answer straight away but
it's great for inspiration right it
inspires me like oh interesting I'm
stuck here. Do you have some
suggestions? You know, and then it comes
up with a couple of suggestions. For

[35:30]
up with a couple of suggestions. For
example, spoiler alert, later in the
podcast, we do a little rapid fire, you
know, you just ask him, okay, okay, we
have these questions now. Adam made a
list of questions that I like. They
said, this is what we currently have.
Have any suggestions for more and then
it just starts spitting out and I'm not
going to copy them. I'm going to use

[35:45]
going to copy them. I'm going to use
one. I'm like, oh, I like this. Maybe
tweak it a bit with your own experience,
you know? So that's how I currently use
AI and I would imagine this only starts
evolving. I mean you don't have to make
anything yourself anymore. You have to
give a a presentation. Well, there's

[36:00]
give a a presentation. Well, there's
probably an AI for presentation there.
There's there's AIS for everything
nowadays. Yeah. Yeah. I mean like number
one, I think you you're absolutely
right. Um, I think number two, it's
great to see that, you know, you as a
parent really

[36:17]
parent really
take action into
um, harnessing that kind of knowledge. I
think that's what I want to ping off of.
So, like when you care really deeply
about something, you put your focus
there and you want to make it the best

[36:30]
there and you want to make it the best
possible. So, one, using data and
technology, you kind of are, you always,
you're not going to get away from one
thing. is called garbage in garbage out.
Um, so
I think the the like real key here would

[36:47]
I think the the like real key here would
be to get quality data but then do what
you said about your process, right? Like
you're still the subject matter expert.
Like a po any kind of AI engine that you
would build would need a lot of training

[37:00]
would build would need a lot of training
in order to really understand what the
objectives are. And from a first
principles point of view then like okay
build database train model to understand
exactly what the things are that I'm

[37:16]
exactly what the things are that I'm
looking to achieve and then from that
okay so like how can I both build an
environment how can I build an optimal
learning environment based on that if
it's for personal use and how can I

[37:30]
it's for personal use and how can I
build an optimal learning environment
that's catered to me that's fun, that's
engaging, that gets me, that that kind
of like hits that sweet spot of getting
me to fail about 15% of the time because
that's our optimal learning rate on
average. Like I I say on average because

[37:47]
average. Like I I say on average because
all these kind of scientific numbers are
always as a global average. Some people
might need to fail 20% at a time in
order to maximize their learning rate
and some people that might be 10% of the
time they need more encouragement. Uh
that type of thing. Uh but just like

[38:03]
that type of thing. Uh but just like
having some kind of tailwind that's like
forward force that that puts you in in
that space that uh that really works for
you. I think that's really cool. Um but
then I also want to touch on one thing

[38:15]
then I also want to touch on one thing
that I think can be quite problematic,
right? Like uh I want to make a analogy
that I think everyone can relate to. Um,
at least everyone that was born before
the cell phone and before modern

[38:30]
the cell phone and before modern
technology. So like I used to drive
around and I had to know where I was
going, right? Like I had to I had to
know what the city looked like. I had to
like constantly map that out in my mind.
And the first time is kind of scary,

[38:45]
And the first time is kind of scary,
right? like you're like on some road
somewhere and you don't know where
you're going and you have to like pull
up your your map to do it. But the thing
is like fear in that sense it makes us
pay attention and paying attention is

[39:01]
pay attention and paying attention is
something that's very
um rewarding because it it gets our
brain to actually work really well.
Unless it's like you know your adala
shuts down. It's not that type of fear
that I'm talking about. I'm talking
about like concern maybe it's a better

[39:16]
about like concern maybe it's a better
way to put it um puts us into like this
actual state and the problem that we're
running into by outsourcing all these
things is we're actually putting
ourselves more in a beta state like
you're just a passive observer I mean

[39:30]
you're just a passive observer I mean
anything from consuming Netflix too late
at night like if you finish your day
with watching Netflix you had a long day
at work that's cool right like we all
have our day and then we just want to
kick it and have someone else like pick
your blinders take away the show for us
and watch them shoot each other up. Uh

[39:48]
and watch them shoot each other up. Uh
that's not the problem though. The
problem is not that you don't like you
shouldn't allow yourself to chill. The
problem is that when you kind of
um allow yourself to go to bed in that
way, you're in your brain waves are in a

[40:01]
way, you're in your brain waves are in a
beta state and then you wake up the same
way and you start living your life like
a passive observer. So, back to Google
Maps is
when you get to a place, you kind of
want to figure it out for yourself as

[40:16]
want to figure it out for yourself as
much as possible. You might want to pull
up your Google maps, you know, so when
you're in a in a GIF or like you know
where you're going, that's not where um
then then like use it when you need it.
But if you constantly do it the other

[40:31]
But if you constantly do it the other
way, you can live your whole life in the
city and you don't even know it.
And I think that's like a very very
profound insight that I really want to
like give everyone the ethical way of
integrating technology because at the

[40:45]
integrating technology because at the
end of the day who is technology for
well for us but that that's kind of my
point right that I said earlier we we
make we design all these things because
we think it's what we want but then we
have it then we start using it and then

[41:01]
have it then we start using it and then
it turns out it's causing us a lot of
problems. So, we don't even know what we
want, right? That's kind of the the
quote quote scary future that I have
because we're designing all these
things. We're making all these things,
but is it really what we want, right?

[41:15]
but is it really what we want, right?
More and more, but in the end, the more
more we want less, less less. All right,
let's make this and make that. We got
more complexity. No, we want more
simplicity.
Yeah, I mean 100%. I think it's one of
the biggest questions that you can ask
yourself. What do I want? I think it I

[41:30]
yourself. What do I want? I think it I
think it's like that question that
when you really start thinking about it,
the layer one is probably like I don't
know. And that that's the honest answer.
And um I think I think it just goes back

[41:47]
And um I think I think it just goes back
to I mean I don't want to get too
philosophical and get into like the
conversation about free will here. Uh
but I think that if there was a if there
is a case to be made for free will I
think that is actually

[42:02]
think that is actually
being able to penetrate all the layers
of learned information and go back to
you know your kind of sole purpose. Uh
if you allow me to to say I think it

[42:15]
if you allow me to to say I think it
goes back to to just like the feeling of
uh being light and energy. That's at
least that's how I quantify the soul is
that that that's like pure light and
pure energy. So
um yeah I I think that's a very very

[42:31]
um yeah I I think that's a very very
interesting uh topic to unpack and it
starts with the question what do I want
and that's not for anyone else to answer
for you and if you try to outsource that
it's not going to work it might work for
1 year 3 years 10 years hell 25 years or

[42:48]
1 year 3 years 10 years hell 25 years or
might work until your deathbed and then
you realize like oh my god uh so I
wouldn't I would just wouldn't advise I
would just advise like start with
yourself and and like decide what

[43:00]
yourself and and like decide what
matters to you and what you think
matters probably might not be it. You
know like like I can take an example for
I meet a lot of people in leadership
positions and a lot of them are stuck.
They're stuck doing something that they
don't actually care that much about but

[43:15]
don't actually care that much about but
they're not quite aware that they don't
really like what they do. Um
and
My
role then is just to be a mirror and

[43:30]
role then is just to be a mirror and
keep kind of asking
uh what do you want? How do you think
about this? Uh in order for them to come
to their
um their personal insight and not you
know like not what anyone else told
them, what not what they think they that
they wanted, not what their parents told

[43:46]
they wanted, not what their parents told
them. A lot of people they get stuck in
an idea of like I want to save world
hunger. It sounds like a great idea. But
then my question to them is usually
like, are you willing to do what it
takes to eradicate world hunger? Like,
are you willing to live that life? And

[44:01]
are you willing to live that life? And
if that's the thing that you want to do
with your life, all the more power to
it. I I love you and I I'm I would be so
happy to support you in that quest. But
if that's not the case, take a tackle a
smaller hit, right? Like like take a

[44:15]
smaller hit, right? Like like take a
smaller mountain that you can
realistically scale. Uh that's going to
feel fulfilling. Um because yeah we I
think we all have our um personal
purposes here but a lot of people they
get they get sidetracked for you get

[44:30]
get they get sidetracked for you get
distracted and seemed like a good idea.
How do you then because you kind of said
okay you have to kind of tap into
yourself but but how how do you know
what's yours
like which is yours? Yeah, I actually

[44:47]
like which is yours? Yeah, I actually
have I have something for this. Uh I
will I will plug uh a YouTube channel
called Michael Cely.
He's a he's a hypnosis guy. And uh I
took one of his hypnosises was is called

[45:02]
took one of his hypnosises was is called
finding your life's purpose.
And I'm going to I'm going to I'm going
to be honest with you. When I heard
this, I was a little skeptical. It's
like, you know, like I'm like, "This
sounds like a magic trick.

[45:16]
sounds like a magic trick.
like you know as long as it works man I
don't care if it's magic right so so I
did it it's an hour 10 or something like
that I did it and lo and behold I came
out of that experience and I found my

[45:30]
out of that experience and I found my
life's purpose and which is leadership
for me it was just there was like
I'll take it back one the the first
thing that came out of it was I I
learned what is apparently my spirit
animal which is a some kind of like

[45:46]
animal which is a some kind of like
black jaguar with green. So like that's
that's one thing that I learned and I'm
like okay like that feels good get get
to extrapolate that. Uh but the second
part that came out was

[46:00]
part that came out was
these three words. It was this lead
leader leaders in like very very clear
font right like black background like
shiny three words and that was it like
you know the movie is over like get back

[46:15]
you know the movie is over like get back
to your normal programming uh I I'll
watch the 10:00 news
you you mentioned earlier you were
talking about I think it was the
examples right of the more we get
dependent on technology we sort of for
unlearn the skills right uh I think

[46:31]
unlearn the skills right uh I think
there there's probably is there is a
saying, right? If you don't use it, you
lose it. Is that the saying?
Yeah, I think that I think that works
for everything. I mean, I had a I had a
personal trainer in Stockholm. His name
is Alam Alan Koko Koba. He's uh he used

[46:48]
is Alam Alan Koko Koba. He's uh he used
to play in the like highest division. He
was point guard in the highest division
in France in basketball.
is this big guy, you know, like he's the
guy you like you come into the gym and
you see a guy hanging off some pipes in

[47:00]
you see a guy hanging off some pipes in
like doing a plank upside down in the
ceiling and I'm like, "Oh, there's
Alan." Like, of course, you know,
like really like epic guy and he was
always on my ass. Like like the first of
the first 10 sessions I did with him, he

[47:16]
the first 10 sessions I did with him, he
probably made me puke like six times.
And the first time he's like, "Are you
okay?" And I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, I'm
fine." Like, "Let's get back to it." And
then he didn't ask again.
Um,
so, uh, let's see where where were I go?

[47:30]
so, uh, let's see where where were I go?
Where was I going with this? Uh, you
don't use it, you lose it. Yeah. So, he
he was always there and
there was parts of my body that were not
strong from having played too much
online poker, like sitting down, using

[47:47]
online poker, like sitting down, using
my right arm too much, tensing up. like
you're constantly in a fight or flight
eating lasagna and drinking multivitamin
juice, you know. Uh

[48:01]
juice, you know. Uh
so
he was there and there was a part of my
scapula uh that wasn't fired like it
wasn't like activated and he was always
there picking like what is this? What is
this? and he gave me this um story about

[48:17]
this? and he gave me this um story about
like how something that doesn't move is
dead and that was his definition.
And I really really like that
definition. So instead of like I feel
like using this like you lose it you

[48:32]
like using this like you lose it you
like you don't use it you lose it. It's
kind of like a copout like when I hear
when I say that to myself it's like
something that I put on a t-shirt at the
back and I forget that it's there. Mhm.
Uh instead I like to be more like

[48:46]
Uh instead I like to be more like
actionoriented and and use words in such
a way that it's like if you don't move
it, it's dead.
And and if that doesn't motivate you,
then I mean like I'm not going to be
there to carry you up the hill, right?

[49:01]
there to carry you up the hill, right?
Like like no one is going to be able to
do that for you. If you want to get good
at poker or if you want to lose weight,
like guess what? Like you're going to
have to do it yourself. Um maybe in the
future you will have the chip and you

[49:15]
future you will have the chip and you
can do it like Neo you know he's like
download and you know kung fu but in the
meantime
like how about we create the system that
can do that and and we can also like you
know have more time to to live our lives

[49:31]
know have more time to to live our lives
and loving relationships spend more time
with your kids
um parents like all that stuff that
sometimes take a backseat to our work.
Um because work can be time consuming.
It can be administrative and it can be

[49:47]
It can be administrative and it can be
um
things that you have to do to keep the
wheels turning and to grow it. Uh and
and and we we also care deeply about I
think like all three of us. I I I I kind
of want to like get Adam in into the

[50:01]
of want to like get Adam in into the
conversation as well. Uh, I would like
to ask Adam the question. Um, like how
do you see AI impacting like maybe what
you do in poker? Because we kind of like
that's the audience, right? So, so how
do you see that? Like where do you see

[50:16]
do you see that? Like where do you see
it having a lot of utility or solving
either your pain or your client's pain?
Yeah, very fascinating conversation. I'm
glad you tagged me in because I've been
waiting to um just converse with you
guys on this topic because it's so
fascinating. And for me personally, I

[50:31]
fascinating. And for me personally, I
use it similar to Renee as like a panel
of experts and I have conversations with
it. So I I think the main use case of AI
right now for me is being able to have
conversations and ask why and go deeper
on stuff. So if I think about how poker

[50:45]
on stuff. So if I think about how poker
players could use AI or where it might
evolve, imagine be able to speak to the
solver. It's like GTO wizards, why do
you do that? Where do you generate AV?
So you can have this really interactive
here's the solutions, but right now
there's a big gap of why does the solver
do this? Why does it have this these
answers? Imagine you could go back and

[51:01]
answers? Imagine you could go back and
forth and just learn why the solver does
everything. So now you've got the the
why behind the outputs. That would be
the first step I would see. The second
step I would see is okay now I need to
leak find my game. So I'd plug my game
into a solver or a chatbot or AI and go

[51:15]
into a solver or a chatbot or AI and go
right this is how I play. This is my
current pool. This is what they're
currently doing. What am I missing?
Which win rates aren't good? Then I'd
plug good players in there with good win
rates and go hey these are the best
players in my pool. What are they doing
different that I'm not doing? And now
all of a sudden you're having this
conversation. You're problem solving

[51:30]
conversation. You're problem solving
three different things. What's GTO
doing? What am I doing? What are my
population doing? What you normally do
with a coach, but now you got AI and
you're tailoring it. And the whole thing
would be this fluid conversation of wow,
didn't know this. Ask him more. And I
feel like what I found very useful with
AI. I become more like a child again.

[51:45]
AI. I become more like a child again.
And I just ask why all the time. Why?
Why this? Why this? Oh, that's
interesting. You told me this. Why? I'm
almost like arguing with AI a lot. I'm
like, don't agree with this one. Why are
you saying this for? And then they go,
sorry. Yes, actually. and in some pushes
back and go. I say that said this
because of this reason. So yeah, I'm
using AI to deepen my thinking and to

[52:02]
using AI to deepen my thinking and to
stress test ideas and then also to uh to
understand things deeper and I feel like
it's exactly what Rena said, create
these kind of little traits or whatever
software you use that is an expert in an
area and then using that to deeper your

[52:15]
area and then using that to deeper your
knowledge and go deeper and deeper and
ask for insights and then go back and
forth. And I'm the same as you Anton as
well. I learn a lot through
interactions. Most of my learning
happens through speaking with people,
these kind of conversations. But AI can
also do a very good job of that and it
can speak back at me and it can it's
also very polite. It also goes, "Oh,

[52:31]
also very polite. It also goes, "Oh,
good answer. Good answer." I'm like,
"Yes, can give me give me some
feedback." It feels nice to talk to it.
So, yeah, I feel like I learn much
better than say going to Google and
typing something. I did a university
degree and lots of the lectures just
went over my head because I was like a a
passenger on the wall and there's your

[52:46]
passenger on the wall and there's your
there's your notes. Go do the exam
later. I did okay at university is
through sheer willpower but my mind
doesn't learn that way. I learn from a
conversation. I'd love to go hey what
about this? Uh sorry what I didn't get
that bit in slow things down where you
can't really do that in kind of those

[53:01]
can't really do that in kind of those
settings. So yeah I think that's how I
see I going forwards in terms of
simplicity in terms of how I can see
things. In terms of other things I have
no no clue. My first answer to your
question if you put it on me I would
have been like I don't know because AI
is such a evolving thing that even the

[53:16]
is such a evolving thing that even the
guys building AI I don't think there's a
kind of plan in place of where we're
taking it and it's just like it's a tool
to solve a lot of problems and just yeah
we don't really know how it's going to
evolve but I do feel right now we're in
a place where we can learn at a faster

[53:31]
a place where we can learn at a faster
rate exactly as you you were saying as
well Anton yeah we can tailor it to
ourselves so you should have your own
little teachers experts in areas that
you're learning you should be conversing
with your experts on things you want to
learn deeper and yes the more curious
you are the better answers you'll have

[53:46]
you are the better answers you'll have
and yeah I like R's thing as well of
putting in good data like exactly what
you'll find with like these chat bots if
you're having a conversation with no
data it's just giving you garbage so
he's like all right well thanks for that
but as soon as you give good data and
you refine that data it's like oh now
now you understand and you can have a a

[54:01]
now you understand and you can have a a
meaningful conversation where you you
guys are on the same lens so yeah I
think that's the the way I see it
I I mean, I'll I'll be the first to say
you're hired.
Uh I think I think you you really hit

[54:17]
Uh I think I think you you really hit
the
kind of like the biggest use cases uh on
the head. Um I think I think it's very
and I think also like kind of how to
apply it. I I get it makes me very happy

[54:31]
apply it. I I get it makes me very happy
because I feel like a lot of people are
kind of naysayers, right? Like they
don't I feel the same. I feel like a
child again. I feel like that when I
start actually I feel like when I
started playing poker again I have the
same feeling of like wonder and awe and
this whole thing is just rolling out but

[54:47]
this whole thing is just rolling out but
it's even bigger right like it's like
poker I always knew that that's going to
it's a finite game and it has
limitations in like how broad that
horizon can be you can obviously take

[55:00]
horizon can be you can obviously take
kind of anything into infinity like
there's infinite infinite complexity and
even the smallest things But
um there's still it's still a game and
it has a set of rules and unless we
change those like that's going to set
some outer boundaries for parameters.

[55:15]
some outer boundaries for parameters.
Um
but I think it's
um
I think like the the way we can apply it
are are limitless. And here I want to
strike a chord for this, you know, like

[55:30]
strike a chord for this, you know, like
going from first principles into lateral
thinking, right? Like what am I not
seeing is usually a more interesting
question than what I'm seeing, right?
Like um I use AI a lot to like you said
like stress test but also kind of like

[55:45]
like stress test but also kind of like
fact check myself like scan for
cognitive biases.
Um a good question is just like what am
I not seeing here? And it's also a great
question to ask to your employees,
right? like to if you're like if you
work with someone or you work in a team,

[56:00]
work with someone or you work in a team,
you don't want to be this combative
person who comes in and tells people
kind of what to do and and has this
error bossing people around even though
you just want to be effective. But so
like when I ask for feedback from
someone, they might be intimidated if I
ask them like um say I phrase a question

[56:18]
ask them like um say I phrase a question
and it's like how should I do this?
which seems like a perfectly innocent
question, but to them there's all this
pressure like, "Oh my god, oh my god, I
have to do it right." But now if I
rephrase that and I say, "What would you

[56:31]
rephrase that and I say, "What would you
do if you're in my shoes?" Like you give
someone by words, you give someone
permission. And I think like what I
would like to add to what you said is
that with that infinite curiosity, the
biggest kind of edge is to be a

[56:45]
biggest kind of edge is to be a
wordssmith, right? Because they're like
these models, they're
they process words and the more clear
and concise you can be or you can even
with some words just instigate one
framework that will unblock an entire

[57:00]
framework that will unblock an entire
process whereas if phrased poorly
you will get a completely different
output because you're not saying what
you thought you said so I think like
asking
a lot of questions like you you punched
on that with curiosity but then thinking

[57:17]
on that with curiosity but then thinking
about how can I ask even better
questions and what are the questions I'm
not asking. So like pulling back that
veil. Um I I think the big picture comes

[57:30]
veil. Um I I think the big picture comes
into working on your weaknesses and and
I think that's like a huge underdone
thing because it's it sucks, right? Like
it sucks getting going back to school
and feeling like a beginner unless you

[57:47]
and feeling like a beginner unless you
change your mindset on how to learn.
Like if you frame learning as this, you
know, beginner's mind type of thing and
that every single time that I meet

[58:00]
that every single time that I meet
someone, I'm open. I'm curious. I'm
willing to learn. Um I'm committed to
being the best student. I can learn from
any person that I interact with versus I
don't like that. I don't like what he
said. Um I don't agree with that. Um

[58:18]
said. Um I don't agree with that. Um
I think we we kind of like have this
tendency to spend our lives fighting.
And and I think that
we do that because we don't have the
right words. And I I would kind of say
that if we can learn how to also

[58:30]
that if we can learn how to also
communicate better with other people,
like you can you can take that you can
be more effective in anything you do.
And if there's more nonfair advantage,
like we're still people. We have to work
with people. I like it. Other people
might not. But if you really want to

[58:46]
might not. But if you really want to
amplify your performance,
well, you want to find other people that
are good at them that loves the things
that you don't, right? So like learning
how to talk to them uh might probably
still be the number one um indicator.

[59:02]
still be the number one um indicator.
There's this old thing from how to win
friends and influence people. Uh have
you both read the book? So like in that
book there there's I I can't remember
the exact number. So here's a point for
always like having something to

[59:16]
always like having something to
reiterate the information. Um I think
the the number was something about it
was like 8020, right? 80 80% of the
output that you get in an organization
is going to be from you being able to

[59:30]
is going to be from you being able to
work effectively with people. And my
thesis here and I'm like this seems a
little wonky, right? It's an old book.
So I'm like, so I so I did a little bit
of shallow research on the topic and
realized that that number is actually

[59:47]
realized that that number is actually
being pushed down because of technology,
right? Like you you need less
interactions and you need more like
leverage and now that's going to go in
hypers speed at some point. It might be

[1:00:00]
hypers speed at some point. It might be
like the the her kind of outcome where
you have your personal assistant that
kind of gets you and um understands all
your needs and organizes your calendar.
And I mean like I I'm building a company
around something similar. So I'm

[1:00:16]
around something similar. So I'm
obviously like very intrigued in
creating like very actionable solutions
and digitizing that.
But
the thing that I I realized that people
really want and everyone no one is
exclamed from this that I met so far um

[1:00:33]
exclamed from this that I met so far um
is that we want to be acknowledged in
reality like the first question in a
philosophy class like if a tree falls in
the wood and no one is there to see it
like does it actually fall and the most
satisfying answer I've heard so far is

[1:00:47]
satisfying answer I've heard so far is
that it only falls when observed because
that makes it real And
when we can do that, right, like we can
be there and use our now better
questions and better insights, more

[1:01:02]
questions and better insights, more
qualitative ways of engaging with like
your brother or sister.
uh
you can have more meaningful
interactions which to me is like there's

[1:01:17]
interactions which to me is like there's
me and then there's others and then
anything in between that's that's kind
of life. Um, so I think that that's
that's a really really
um big addition that I hope I hope

[1:01:31]
um big addition that I hope I hope
people I hope people like adopt your
your way of of interacting with this
technology and then I then I hope that
they think about why that makes it
meaningful. Yeah. So there there's no
question there's no question in there. I

[1:01:45]
question there's no question in there. I
just got really inspired from hearing
kind of like your take on this. Um but I
guess my question would be how would you
like to see
um people start and what would be like
an actionable first step that do you

[1:02:01]
an actionable first step that do you
think that someone could do to spark
that curiosity?
Yeah. So I think it's about trying to
solve problems and as you mentioned like
trying to show up better in your world.
That's what we we all want really. We
want a better life but we want to show

[1:02:15]
want a better life but we want to show
up as a better version of ourel. So
Rena's use case was perfect in terms of
parenting. that's close to home for him.
So you set up a a parental panel to go
deeper onto understandably being a
parent. Every single person listening
has things they want to be doing better.
Things you want to be swimming better.
Maybe it's a health goal that you

[1:02:30]
Maybe it's a health goal that you
haven't really got into. So I I think
giving it a job or a problem to solve
and then conversing with it with that as
you mentioned beginner's mindset of
going deeper. So the first thing is
going what problem would I like to solve
and how would I go deeper and you can
really start with a like chacha which is
so basic just like hey looking to get

[1:02:45]
so basic just like hey looking to get
into good shape currently I weigh this
much and I work out once a month what
where do I start and you can you can
really start from a baseline of like
dumb conversation and build like real
build a meaningful kind of training plan
or whatever it is a study plan if you're
a pocket player or so what I like to do

[1:03:01]
a pocket player or so what I like to do
is give context so I like to give a a ch
or something everything I'm currently
doing this is what I currently know this
is what I'm currently at so almost brain
dump just give it as much context
because if I was someone was wanted
advice from me the first thing I would
do is ask lots lots of questions well

[1:03:15]
do is ask lots lots of questions well
what do you know currently what are you
currently doing so I try to give it as
much context as possible if not it's
going to give me some random stuff and
then the goal what's the goal I'm trying
to achieve so I think when you're trying
to uh solve a problem what's the goal
where you trying to get to why is it
meaningful to you why does this matter
why are we having this conversation why

[1:03:30]
why are we having this conversation why
are we wasting time so trying to get a
real clear starting point of this is
what I'm currently doing this is the
goal just apply to anything So I'll use
a personal example how I'm using it for
writing. So I've currently started
writing a blog and I'm writing very long
form like kind of 3,000 words and it's

[1:03:45]
form like kind of 3,000 words and it's
new to me new skill set. So first thing
beginner's mindset I'm not very good at
this. So I'd write long form and then
I'd give it to a charge and I'd
basically exactly what you said critique
it in terms of what am I missing here?
What structure have I gone for? Where
where have I used too many words?

[1:04:00]
where have I used too many words?
Critique this exact sentence where can I
skip a sent skip a paragraph or a few
words. And then I'd really try to
understand what I'm not understanding.
And I think what I've learned from kind
of chatb in particular, the feedback it
gives is actually quite balanced. I
really like it's almost like it's it's

[1:04:15]
really like it's almost like it's it's
kind of kind of goes, you do this well.
This isn't so good and we could probably
change this. And like it's it doesn't
hit me too hard. Whereas if I ask the
person, hey, what do you think of this?
They say send to an editor, you might
go, oh, this really sucks. Like it's
really not a good good piece of work.
We're going to have to start from
scratch with this one. And I'm like, oh

[1:04:30]
scratch with this one. And I'm like, oh
my god, so defeated. Whereas now I've
got this easy like interaction with a a
kind of chat GBT to kind of go back and
forth. But yeah, basically I think the
just to be practical what's the problem
you're trying to solve? What's the goal
you're trying to get to which kind of
inter interact with each other and then
start trying to understand like trying

[1:04:45]
start trying to understand like trying
to understand deeper and then as you
mentioned like it's always showing up
better in the world. So why am I going
for this process to write? I want to be
able to write and communicate better so
I can show up in the world better and to
hopefully inspire some people with the
things I share. That's it. That's that's
all I'm doing. I'm not really doing it
to write down words to for my own good.

[1:05:02]
to write down words to for my own good.
It's for to share with other people. So
I want to be able to show my world
better. So I think that's the the
practical use case and obviously
everyone watching this is interacting
with poker in some way. So think about
it for yourself. How can you be a better
poker player? What are you missing? And
I think what you say as well, what

[1:05:15]
I think what you say as well, what
what's the what are the questions you're
not asking? So maybe people asking about
strategy, maybe they're asking about
overall uh performances as a poker
player, but what are you what are you
not doing currently? What are you
missing? So give it context of what
you're currently doing to perform well
as a poker player. Then ask it, what

[1:05:30]
as a poker player. Then ask it, what
could I be missing? What could I be
doing more of that would help me towards
my personal goals. Then create your own
hero's journey. If this is me trying to
get the goal, help me with this. You're
my co-pilot. And then every day you go
in there and go, "Hey, this what I've
done today. Is this in line with the
goals? What can I do better?" It's just
constant back and forth. Now I'm kind of
using a journal app as well where every

[1:05:46]
using a journal app as well where every
day I'm kind of reflecting on my day and
going, "Hey, this what I did today in
line with my goals. Give me some
feedback." Normally goes, "Well done.
You did this good. That's very, very
good. you could add a bit of this if you
if you got it more energy then in the
day I'm like okay can I do this better
so now I've got like a personal
interacting with something that's

[1:06:01]
interacting with something that's
understands my goals it's got context
and it's given me insights into things I
might miss so yeah listen listen
listening to you by the way it it got me
thinking about something interesting
because how so nor I think the majority
of people would also write would also

[1:06:17]
of people would also write would also
put it in JPT but it would just say give
me give me the perfect give me just a
perfect outcome People have the desire
that they just want the outcome, right?
Whereas you were curious like, hey,

[1:06:30]
Whereas you were curious like, hey,
don't just give me the answer, tell me
how you got to it, so I want to learn.
But I think the majority of people just
want the outcome, which I think you can
link perfectly back to poker with like
solvers. A lot of people just want want
to know what do I have to do and they

[1:06:45]
to know what do I have to do and they
kind of miss the they don't have the
curiosity to uncover like, hey, how you
got there? That that I find the
interesting part. And then I thought
like okay on one side you could say that
with AI more people have access to it so
it could level the playing field but

[1:07:00]
it could level the playing field but
like you just said I think actually it
will only make the gap bigger because
it's your mindset towards it right and
how you use it you will only get you
will only get better and the people who
are looking for shortcuts they will only
fall further behind. Do you think it do

[1:07:16]
fall further behind. Do you think it do
you think it will level the playing
field or do you agree with me that it
will probably only amplify uh the people
who have your approach they will only
become better and the rest will only
fall further behind even though you
could say we now have access to the same
tool. I mean, it depends how many bots
are in the pool, right? Like

[1:07:32]
are in the pool, right? Like
like like that's that's the danger. Like
the the existential danger is is that
you're actually not playing against a
human and that they are either like
assisted or completely like there that

[1:07:46]
assisted or completely like there that
there's a bot playing because that
outcome it was always kind of like
annoying in poker. like just just being
up against bots is uh annoying because
they're filling the seat of a
potentially weaker player whether it's a

[1:08:01]
potentially weaker player whether it's a
regular or or a recreational player. Um
so it makes for like a different type of
playing experience, but the bots used to
be
uh pretty bad. I like like I I have some

[1:08:15]
uh pretty bad. I like like I I have some
I'd never really battled bots, but I had
some heads up guys that were like
dealing bots for 5B00 and just like
taking that money to the bank and and
enjoying it. But the problem becomes
once you start applying real time
analytics to that. Uh you're not going

[1:08:31]
analytics to that. Uh you're not going
to be able to run them over by
overbuffing the river and they're
they're not adjusting, right? So um is
kind of rolling it back to to that. I
think that's a bigger picture question
that I think is

[1:08:46]
undertalked about in poker. Um I I I
have some potential like maybe want to
explore a couple of solutions. I don't
like talking about problems. I like
talking about like how would I solve
this. Um
but I think from a

[1:09:01]
but I think from a
from a personal competitive advantage
point of view definitely right like it's
like that with everything. Like just
going back to the analogy of the guy
showing up to the job interview with a
shovel when when there's a concrete
truck or like a concrete spaceship even

[1:09:16]
truck or like a concrete spaceship even
uh to to really drive home the point. Um
uh that's of course uh going to be
natural selection and I think we're
already seeing that. If you would like
map out the poker ecosystem and see
who's winning and who's losing and why

[1:09:31]
who's winning and who's losing and why
and like do a deeper dive analysis
there, you're probably going to realize
that the people that are
more curious,
more actionoriented,

[1:09:45]
more
solutions oriented. Maybe
solutionsoriented is better than action
oriented. Like they're more solutions
oriented and then like they take action
to to make those craft those solutions.
um they're going to be the big winners
in the pool and they're all it's always
going to be like that in any
environment. It doesn't matter if it's

[1:10:01]
environment. It doesn't matter if it's
poker and poker is nice because it is
this
kind of like dynamic and and relatively
flexible equilibrium, but you can map it
out easily like it doesn't it doesn't
you don't have to be rocket scientist to

[1:10:15]
you don't have to be rocket scientist to
understand how it works uh because
you're constantly trading money. Like I
see poker players as a hybrid between a
trader and a tennis player. Like you
have to show up for practice yourself.
You have to keep hitting the ball. It's

[1:10:30]
You have to keep hitting the ball. It's
kind of grueling. It's ups and downs.
Like tennis has less variance. And but
then you like integrate trading in that
part of the algorithm. And now your job
is just to like make as many like small
trades as possible. Every bet is a trade

[1:10:45]
trades as possible. Every bet is a trade
essentially. Um,
and
I mean both has a ball, right? Like if
you look at I'm not an expert at Novak
Dookovich. I haven't read his biography,
but like the way that he's managed his

[1:11:00]
but like the way that he's managed his
career seems like very on point and
that's why he has the results that he
has. And you can look at some YouTube
videos where like
the statistics is not that much, right?
like like he used to bet an average of
like winning whatever like slightly less

[1:11:15]
like winning whatever like slightly less
than 50% of points and to to go from
that to world class was like
he's like winning slightly more than
average now and then like keep pushing
that those like small incremental gains

[1:11:30]
that those like small incremental gains
by all of the lifestyle changes whatever
like all the stuff that that goes into
uh becoming NovakJokovich versus traders
where Um I recently through Perplexity
by the way I forgot that that's all the
only place I read my news is on

[1:11:45]
only place I read my news is on
Perplexity. Great place to they have
like a digest page that you can read
your news which is not the doom and
gloom from regular media. It's more like
hey here's the scientific breakthrough
and like hey here's something you find
very interesting and hey here is a world

[1:12:00]
very interesting and hey here is a world
new that news that you should actually
pay attention to because it matters uh
and it's backed by source and relevant
because any anything else is just an
opinion and we can read opinion pieces
that's great but when I when I want to
know what's going on I need facts

[1:12:16]
know what's going on I need facts
um so the the fact that I was I found in
that news feed was that index fund had
outperformed traders by 2x. Like Wall
Street Traders was outperformed by
simple index funds by twice. Like

[1:12:30]
simple index funds by twice. Like
there's a ginormous margin when you
really like think about why that is. And
then you know they do why why why
it's like lower costs uh less human
error less like general overhead

[1:12:47]
error less like general overhead
um better real time um adjustments
right? So like like I think it's like a
perfect example that kind of illustrates
the point of
when you augment both right like the

[1:13:00]
when you augment both right like the
Novakovich
uh and his process to become an elite
competitor and like doing those
incremental gains for you as an athlete
like in our case mind athletes for the
most part but like you have to power
that with your physical performance as
well obviously uh nutrition and anything

[1:13:17]
well obviously uh nutrition and anything
else that that kind of fuels
performance.
Um, and you add the data analytics and
insights and real-time predictions and
cutting costs and becoming more
efficient. Now you're supercharged,

[1:13:30]
efficient. Now you're supercharged,
right? Like now you have the best of
both worlds. Um, and a very datadriven
way as well to to get predictably good
outcomes, which I think is like the

[1:13:45]
there's never been a a more sure time to
be successful. if you apply yourself
because you can now do your market
research like I could I could have an
idea. I I have I do this all the time. I
have an idea and I used to have to go

[1:14:03]
have an idea and I used to have to go
through this whole
process of proving that this is a good
idea.
And imagine like going back to like the
the distractions like imagine how many
times I get distracted in that process

[1:14:16]
times I get distracted in that process
and I go off and I do something I'm not
supposed to do. Like that's the biggest
cost in that like the actual work that I
do can be quite efficient and rewarding
and it's fun and you know you got to
group together with people and you talk
about it and figure out some solution

[1:14:31]
about it and figure out some solution
and it's worthwhile. That's that's life.
Um but the distractions that's a big
cost and
now I can do my market research. I can
say like hey I have this idea I think is
really good. could you help me kind of

[1:14:47]
really good. could you help me kind of
spawn the idea a little bit further so
it's not my halfbaked idea of what that
would be? Could you make that into
something compact? And then I put it
through some one of the research
engines. I can't wait to use Manis. I

[1:15:00]
engines. I can't wait to use Manis. I
haven't teased it yet, but like some
kind of research engine like deep search
like um elicit. It's if you haven't
checked out elillicit, I will give you a
recommendation. It's
incredibly powerful. It's like they

[1:15:15]
incredibly powerful. It's like they
they're outperforming every the research
and on the benchmark. So So check that
one out. Um it's also more like it's
more
um
it's putting the the it like you would
in in a very academic paper, right? It's

[1:15:30]
in in a very academic paper, right? It's
like it's it's an academic paper engine.
Um so you can if you have a big
question, I go there, but it cost you
cost you a fair bit of money to run your
data that way. uh if you have a smaller
question, just do like a quick like gro
search uh or a deep search and you're

[1:15:45]
search uh or a deep search and you're
going to get back here's your initial
market research. And remember how I said
that you can now do all everything in
like this virtual simulator with the
robots, right? Like what you can do now
is you can virtually simulate your

[1:16:02]
is you can virtually simulate your
product from market research, target
audience,
sub audiences. Who would be more likely
to actually like adopt this kind of
technology? Why?

[1:16:17]
technology? Why?
Then send that to prototype, create a
demo, send demo back to my table.
say, "Hey, I have this demo now. Give me
a marketing plan, right? Like I want to

[1:16:31]
a marketing plan, right? Like I want to
use score app to craft a mini survey
where I start initiating my clients, my
my potential customers.
And from that,
how can I engage them in a way where

[1:16:47]
how can I engage them in a way where
they're not going to find me dreadfully
boring?
they're going to actually like maximize
their engagement because of our
attention span having dropped from 8 12
seconds to 8 fact. It's like we have to

[1:17:01]
seconds to 8 fact. It's like we have to
people's attention is lower and lower
and and it's being commoditized and
people are waking up to that fact. Um,
so what you want to do is kind of I mean
maybe we stopped here because like
personal branding I think is like the

[1:17:15]
personal branding I think is like the
the biggest topic of 2025 and I don't
want to like get off on a tangent or a
monologue. We also want to like allow us
for natural points to um stop in the
stop in the conversation. But like what
are some things you get to you get to

[1:17:32]
are some things you get to you get to
whoever wants to go first? Like what was
something that piqu your interest in in
the past probably like 3 minutes that I
talked? Maybe it was five. I don't know.
Ren, you want to jump in?
I mean actually what piqu my interest I

[1:17:45]
I mean actually what piqu my interest I
know that actually is something uh but
it's it's not really really related I
think to what you said in the last five
minutes was more something that
triggered it.
Yeah. Go for it. Go for it. Oh yeah. I
mean I wrote down like you know you you
mentioned I was kind of piecing some

[1:18:01]
mentioned I was kind of piecing some
pieces puzzles together. Uh extroverted
guy. You were talking a lot about your
customers. Uh and then I was like hm you
you I know you like to play a lot of
live poker. you know, we can also see
your opponents sort of as your
customers, right? You're trying to take

[1:18:15]
customers, right? You're trying to take
their money. So, I actually wrote down a
question for later on, but you know,
here we are. Like, you know, how how
these skills uh have helped you, for
example, in poker to get paid off, for
example. I was I was going to go
somewhere in that direction that that's
where my mind was going, but it was not

[1:18:30]
where my mind was going, but it was not
really related to specifically what you
talked about the last five minutes.
I think how how I've been paid is with
um number one is knowledge and number
two is network.
I think those are the biggest value

[1:18:46]
I think those are the biggest value
drivers that that I've achieved uh
during this time. Like knowledge is just
never goes out of fad. Uh it's it's a
very very robust thing that you keep in
your brain pocket and you get to carry

[1:19:00]
your brain pocket and you get to carry
it with you anywhere you go. Uh, and
I've been fortunate to like one of the
biggest fascination I had with poker was
that live poker you could sit down and
play with
eight other individuals or seven if
you're lucky if it's an eight max stable

[1:19:16]
you're lucky if it's an eight max stable
preferred. Um, and chances are that one
of those guys will be very mostly guys
but like one of those guys or girls will
be very interesting. Um, because they
everyone has their I'm not saying you
know everyone is a snowflake. everyone

[1:19:31]
know everyone is a snowflake. everyone
has their story and everyone is
interesting, but some people just
put in more work and created something
more tangible or like have a unique
point of view of the world. Um, and I'm
always fascinated by that. So I think

[1:19:46]
always fascinated by that. So I think
like poker really attracted me and it
really attracted me was when I realized
that oh my god like I have an infinite
pool almost highly interesting people
and every day is kind of like this
raffle like who am I going to get today

[1:20:02]
raffle like who am I going to get today
and you know some days it's just like
Bill and Joe from Texas and another day
it's like four traders from from New
York firms that are at the WSOP table

[1:20:15]
York firms that are at the WSOP table
and they're all kind of swinging their
decks and just saying like who's who's
got the like who's who's bigger up in
the ecosystem and another day um you
know like I met some of my best friends
like Jeff Sor who's he was a like under

[1:20:31]
like Jeff Sor who's he was a like under
10 world champion of chess and he was
like he was competing with um
some of the best out there and I think
like Josh Watkins right like a personal

[1:20:45]
like Josh Watkins right like a personal
hero of mine and like Jeff was the guy
who beat him,
you know, like like how epic is that? Uh
uh and I think we kind of a lot of
people have a tendency to forget that
poker is not just

[1:21:01]
poker is not just
it's not just a game where you're like
your job is to make the most amount of
money. It's an entertainment product,
right? Like you are the entertainment.
And when people start forgetting that,
you lose customers, right? Like you lose

[1:21:17]
you lose customers, right? Like you lose
customers and you lose clients because
you ask a 100 people of a 100 in a poker
turn, why are you here? I want to win.
I'm like, great. But now I ask, why are
you here? You know, like what's in it

[1:21:30]
you here? You know, like what's in it
for you? If you wanted to win, if that
was your number one objective, you
wouldn't fold ace king so you could call
your wife the next like when you're done
with the day and say you made the money,
right? Like you were there to win. You
like happily stack it off and you just

[1:21:45]
like happily stack it off and you just
be like, "All right, I'll take my EV and
the glory. Thank you very much." So just
to highlight the
fact that everyone people are paying
poker is a product that people are
paying for. It's also a game. It's a

[1:22:00]
paying for. It's also a game. It's a
skill game. Um, but yeah, I think like
that's the biggest uh like
that kind of knowledge I wouldn't be
able to source anywhere else. I wouldn't
have access to these people and it's
opened a lot of doors for me in my life
like anywhere from um authors to VC

[1:22:19]
like anywhere from um authors to VC
because everyone finds poker fascinating
and touring because it is a very
interesting game um and environment and
lifestyle. Um
and then um yeah so so so like that goes

[1:22:32]
and then um yeah so so so like that goes
in that goes into the the network side
of things. Um because
at the at the end of the day people are
attracted what they're attracted to. You
can't really twist them arm twist their
arm and say like hey

[1:22:47]
arm and say like hey
like you should find me really like sexy
and they're like yeah all about that you
know you're kind of twisting my arm
here. Um
so
um

[1:23:00]
um
one one one being like when having it's
almost like having an unfair advantage
right people you step into a room and
people say what do you do and you say
I'm a poker player and they're like oh
you're not an accounting amazing

[1:23:15]
you're not an accounting amazing
uh not knock me on accountants you know
but just take a silly example
um and and yeah I think those are those
are the big two. What what has it been
for you? What's been the most um like
what what got you really got you into

[1:23:30]
what what got you really got you into
poker? Like what was what was your
thing? Was it competing? Was it winning?
Was it like the stuff that you get from
the money? I guess not because you're
still here.
For me personally, it was purely the
interest in strategic games and like

[1:23:46]
interest in strategic games and like
just purely the gaming aspect. Like I
always played games, I video games,
strategy games. So for me it was pure
purely the game and actually at some
point what got me into it I got myself
in such a big hole that there was there

[1:24:00]
in such a big hole that there was there
was like I couldn't quit even if I
wanted to. I kind of put myself in a
very bad spot where I was like well [ __ ]
well I got to make this work. Uh so I
don't know what would have happened uh
if that situation was different if I
would have still been there. Um but I

[1:24:15]
would have still been there. Um but I
got I had to get myself into such a big
hole that actually I'm very grateful for
but because it kind of triggered like
this self-development journey of like
okay well I have to try to dig myself
out of this and that's when I started to
learn how to learn and you know things

[1:24:31]
learn how to learn and you know things
about growth mindset. I started to learn
that oh if you do what you do or what
you eat actually has an impact on how
you feel and how you perform. Oh really
interesting. I never I never knew that.
I never knew that I could learn. And I
never knew that I had control over my
performance. So in a way was not

[1:24:45]
performance. So in a way was not
pleasant. It was not necessarily the
most pleasant uh um period of my po
career but it was the catalyst towards
the mindset that I still have today
right towards towards growth towards
thinking about solutions. Um

[1:25:00]
thinking about solutions. Um
actually I I did actually want to
quickly quickly uh uh touch on a point
that you mentioned because you said when
I sit down you were curious for who was
at your table but purely for how they
were as a person whereas I think most
people the first thing they look at is

[1:25:15]
people the first thing they look at is
okay what are the chip stacks for
example right because they think
strategic and it's just like what Adam
did with his writing his letter right
and giving it to the bot it's like the
mindset with which you go in right the
perspective that that that that that you
have and I was curious like um you seem

[1:25:32]
have and I was curious like um you seem
to understand people very well, right?
Uh how has it helped you like in on the
actual poker table in terms of
understanding for example you said the
guy was going to fold this king because
he wanted to call to his wife that he he

[1:25:46]
he wanted to call to his wife that he he
was going to get in the money. How has
like these people skills and
understanding I guess we could say
psychology of people how have how has
that helped you sort of read the table
if if we can say it like that. Sure.

[1:26:00]
if if we can say it like that. Sure.
Sure. I think it's a great question. Um
I'll I'll take one step back and and
kind of
I don't really believe in talent. Uh I
think I think like maybe there's

[1:26:16]
think I think like maybe there's
something there in terms of
like who we are. Uh and I I probably
will never know if that's true or not.
Like you know is it like nature versus
nurture? Um but for me

[1:26:30]
nurture? Um but for me
I really when I started playing poker I
came to a realization that I was quite
sensitive towards people's
uh energy and I found that out really
quick through getting a lot of

[1:26:45]
quick through getting a lot of
repetition in. Like in poker you get a
lot of feedback. It's the other thing
that I find so fascinating. It's I'm
really glad you brought that up because
the other thing that really fascinated
me early in my career when it was just a
hobby um was

[1:27:03]
hobby um was
I guess like in a way when and when and
if someone breaks
like I can't put it in a in a in a less
blunt way because I don't know I've been
steal it or like oh did this guy get his

[1:27:16]
steal it or like oh did this guy get his
breaking point I've been in the g this
game for years and to quote It kind of
made me an animal in that sense, right?
Like it it's
it's so fascinating to see someone, you
know, like everyone can act tough, but

[1:27:32]
know, like everyone can act tough, but
then when it really comes down to it and
you're there and you're playing for a
lot, like are you the kind of guy who is
just like Iceman and and like kind of
lasers in or do you buckle? And I think

[1:27:46]
lasers in or do you buckle? And I think
it says a lot about people in in big and
in small environments uh like when
you're in flow and you're feeling it,
can you pull the bluff? But like on a
Wednesday afternoon and you haven't like

[1:28:00]
Wednesday afternoon and you haven't like
order your morning coffee yet, are you
able to pull the trigger? Or like late
night when you're tired and you already
made a lot of decisions in the day and
you just want to go home to bed and call
your wife and say everything is good. I
made it honey. We made the money. we're
we're going we're moving forward here in
the World Series of Poker. Um

[1:28:18]
the World Series of Poker. Um
like
I I think that that's the
my thesis just to zoom out even one
bigger layer is that as poker players we
get a lot of feedback. We get a lot of

[1:28:31]
get a lot of feedback. We get a lot of
feedback really really quick and our
ability to translate that to our other
actions. I think what separates like
kind of there's two kinds of poker
player in my opinion. There's the kind
of who only like to play poker which is

[1:28:45]
of who only like to play poker which is
great. Uh like you love the game and and
that's that's what you do and that's the
main focus. Or there's the kind of
people that is like
incredibly curious and and and really
like they they're fascinated by multiple
things and they can really like also do

[1:29:00]
things and they can really like also do
anything based on that. and Poker kind
of attracted them because it was
opportunity. Like you see people from
chess, from uh previously esports, but
now those guys are Richard and N. So
like, haha, like joke is on them. Um

[1:29:16]
like, haha, like joke is on them. Um
people from Magic the Gathering, right?
Like you you had all these people that
came into
uh poker in in that way.
Um, so yeah, I I think that

[1:29:34]
yeah, there there's so many things I
love about this game. Um, I really think
I really think that it's a perfect
mini environment that reflects life and

[1:29:45]
mini environment that reflects life and
that we can learn so much from from each
one of these interactions. And then, you
know, we're humans. We forget. We sit
down at the table. I didn't have my
morning coffee. This guy looks like a
jerk off. like it's a it's a different
story to to actually do it. Um

[1:30:02]
story to to actually do it. Um
but but that's when it's good to remind
yourself that you are the entertainment,
right? That you want to keep the game
going for as long as possible. You want
to also enjoy your time. Uh that that
guy also has a has a life and he's not
here to win in the game, you know, like

[1:30:16]
here to win in the game, you know, like
he's here to have a pleasurable
experience and he's here to so like, you
know, don't [ __ ] on people's experience.
like just just give them what what they
want and be graceful that you're a
better poker player than them and and
that's your job, right? I think that's

[1:30:31]
that's your job, right? I think that's
what being a real professional is. Big

without further ado, guys, let's
continue chatting with Anton. So, if you
kind of consider that sort of your the
thing that got you your biggest edge,

[1:32:01]
thing that got you your biggest edge,
right, that you have a good sense of
kind of where people are at, right, in
their in their emotional state. How have
you find this
like obviously poker kept on evolving
right and I feel like let's say 10 years

[1:32:16]
right and I feel like let's say 10 years
ago compared to now for example I can be
in a not great state but you know people
have done so many theory you know and
they're like baseline have gone higher
that they will still make the bluff
because they know it's good even though
you know they didn't have their morning
coffee right so how how how do you feel

[1:32:31]
coffee right so how how how do you feel
like that that uh that skill uh is
helping you today compared to in the
past and how have you evolved with, you
know, the fact that people don't make
plays anymore as much based on how

[1:32:45]
plays anymore as much based on how
they're currently feeling?
Well, I mean, number one, like let's
just draw out the the map here, right?
Like you sit down and you play and
everyone knows that you're playing a

[1:33:00]
everyone knows that you're playing a
game,
right? Like you you paid your buy in.
like you're well aware that I'm going to
be here and I'm going to compete against
other people. So
when you know that you're playing a game
and that the game is about deception and

[1:33:15]
and that the game is about deception and
it's about concealment and it's about
tricking people into doing things,
right? Like
now you have the first clue.
That's that's your first clue. Like now
you got to think because Bill from Texas

[1:33:31]
you got to think because Bill from Texas
or like Renee from Netherlands are going
to have a very different opinion about
how that should that objective should be
proceed should be um how that should be
done. And now

[1:33:47]
the limitation that we have is that you
have some you have this attention
economy, right? Like you can only pay so
much attention in a day because you're
not as much as I would like to be
Terminator. I I'm not right. Like I

[1:34:01]
Terminator. I I'm not right. Like I
still have that limitation. So I can't
pay attention to everything all the
time. But
I will register it, right? like my if I
see something if something is in my
visual field I will actually acknowledge

[1:34:15]
visual field I will actually acknowledge
that it's there but my focus is is
elsewhere. So I'm actually like what you
focus on is your reality and then the
other stuff is just like kind of being
recorded.
Um
so now it's it's a matter of where do I

[1:34:30]
so now it's it's a matter of where do I
direct my spotlight like like what would
be the people that I should pay
attention to because Renee I he's a
strong player. he's probably going to,
you know, like do a pretty good job of
like not giving me his money and unless
the morning coffee is like significantly

[1:34:46]
the morning coffee is like significantly
late.
Uh, but this other guy, he like Bill
from Texas, right? Like
he really like like all of a sudden like
his morning coffee doesn't get come in
and he starts complaining about it and

[1:35:01]
and he starts complaining about it and
he's like like he really takes offense.
The service here is slow so slow. Oh my
god. Right. Um, and then you can go down
the like the layers of this to like if
you can really be in in flow. If you can

[1:35:15]
you can really be in in flow. If you can
really be in that like harmony that we
all know what it feels like. I I bet you
that you can like zoom back to that
moment where you're completely locked in
and like online is like this guy doesn't
have it. Like I like I know from his
pattern that like he wouldn't take like

[1:35:31]
pattern that like he wouldn't take like
those extra two seconds if he was um if
he was on on the value side of his
range, right? like it feels like magic,
but when you actually break that down
into like what that process looks like,

[1:35:45]
into like what that process looks like,
it's more about
repetition, experience,
um understanding, knowledge,
um curiosity,
is able to like connect different types

[1:36:02]
is able to like connect different types
of variables into a decision that you're
making. And if
we can get out of our own way in that
decision-m process
while having a strong theoretical

[1:36:16]
while having a strong theoretical
framework to reaffirm that like you're
not going to be right all the time
either like honing in on a live read on
someone is like I can take one example
practical example I play this tournament
in Barcelona
and we're at the river guy shoves it's

[1:36:33]
and we're at the river guy shoves it's
like he's buffing or he has said and
it's a big spot
and I'm there like okay like let's see
if I can pick something up on this guy
and I'm sitting right next to him

[1:36:45]
and I'm sitting right next to him
and his pulse is just going like
like this and I'm like okay
so I got something to go off right and
now I think hm I'll just kind of wait

[1:37:00]
now I think hm I'll just kind of wait
for a while because that's like my my
most reliable way of of like ging
information. We'll see if his pulse
drops. And like it's like two and a half
minutes. Someone calls the floor and I'm
like, "Okay, like if if like it doesn't
like I'm not going to continue to run

[1:37:16]
like I'm not going to continue to run
the clock down because like if his pulse
is up, it's up. It's been 3 minutes."
And I call and he has it. And I'm like,
"What?" And it's like, "Oh, well, I
guess he was just like that excited
about being on the river and having the

[1:37:30]
about being on the river and having the
nuts." And I think it's a good example
of you can be the best in the world or
you can be uh just an average person try
to make these decisions. You're not
always going to be right. But the more
you can lean into

[1:37:46]
you can lean into
um
making decisions based on your intuition
rather than just your logic. Uh that's
going to be a whole lot less energy
consuming which is just a win in itself.
But it also opens up your mind to have
higher executive decision- making. So

[1:38:01]
higher executive decision- making. So
like you could pay attention to like
another thing in another thing and then
those become lower down in the
hierarchy, right? Like once you now like
kind of standardize that format and you
can build say like a stack of
information, now all of a sudden you

[1:38:16]
information, now all of a sudden you
open yourself up to paying attention to
something else and that's your new
focus. It's more narrow. It's like
higher pix like it has a better
resolution, a higher pixelation.
Um,
so again, like I just want to

[1:38:31]
so again, like I just want to
like I'm not going to be able to ever
give any really like practical tips
because they're probably just bogus,
right? Like the I think the team of 2024
is like, "Hey, here's my blueprint." And
I'm like, "That's great. Is it
customized for my needs?" It's like,

[1:38:45]
customized for my needs?" It's like,
"No." Okay, thank you very much. Like
I'll I I'll guess I'll like take
something out of it and try it. And also
going to your point Rene of like or
actually Adam about um
that was you Rene like the like creating

[1:39:00]
that was you Rene like the like creating
your workout plan is like a very basic
kind of use case but a lot of people get
stuck there like they get stuck in like
create my workout plan. That's like I
ask people all the time how do you use
AI? They're like I create a workout
plan. I'm like that's great for you.
Like it's amazing right? Like you can

[1:39:16]
Like it's amazing right? Like you can
you can do that. can be pretty good, but
you're not
optimizing your workout plan. Like that
would be the like I'd use it to research
because my like goal is optimal

[1:39:30]
because my like goal is optimal
performance and longevity.
It's not like getting six packs apps
like you will get that as a byproduct of
optimal performance and longevity. So
you have a really like good goal, right?
Like you have a goal that kind of
transcends and it never stops. That's a

[1:39:45]
transcends and it never stops. That's a
like to me that's like a good life goal
is that something that you have to do if
I would define it as like something that
you have to do every day uh in little
Lawrence in big that will keep driving
you forward and it will give you

[1:40:00]
you forward and it will give you
limitless motivation
uh and you're going to have to keep
jumping uh because that means you're
going to keep getting out of bed, you're
going to keep doing your workout, you're
going to keep eating healthy, you're
going to keep doing all those other
things that then powers is your other

[1:40:15]
things that then powers is your other
goal, right? It's like start with
foundations
and then
you can either look at an elite
performer and be jealous of what they
have or you can figure out how to do it

[1:40:30]
have or you can figure out how to do it
yourself and like create some actual
magic. Like being there in that spot and
lasering in on someone and getting the
right read when you drill that it's like
to me that's the best feeling in the
world. like that makes me feel
accomplished and no one else can make me

[1:40:47]
accomplished and no one else can make me
feel accomplished and I
it again comes back to like what we
talked about earlier like the use it or
if you don't use it you lose it. It's
like you clearly with all your
experience you know you kept on sitting
there you kept on looking for this

[1:41:00]
there you kept on looking for this
information. Very good point by the way
because usually if I take this to online
poker people want to know you know
there's this very good guy at the table
and you want to know because he's the
good guy right? he's bothering you and
people put all their energy in him but
what you can actually gain from him is

[1:41:15]
what you can actually gain from him is
very minimal. So it's way better you you
redirect your attention to the
recreational but they're like ah but I
already beat the recreational it's not
intellectually stimulating but like you
said focus on bill because if you focus
on bill your return of investment right
it comes back to the very first thing we
talked about right your energy

[1:41:30]
talked about right your energy
management well it's it's it's it's
doesn't cost you a lot of energy but it
will get you the most rewards so going
back to the first principle you said
focusing on bill seems like a very good
idea and where you know if we think
about solver use nowadays um well if you

[1:41:48]
about solver use nowadays um well if you
don't use the process that uh let the
solver to get to an answer right you
forget how that process actually looks
so you obviously also having started
poker before solvers came out just like

[1:42:02]
poker before solvers came out just like
myself and I think still it has some
advantages because we always had to
figure it out ourselves right we had to
always go through all these steps to
come up I don't know how to come to a
correct solution so we had to go through
all these steps and I feel like if you
only look solver outputs, especially if

[1:42:16]
only look solver outputs, especially if
you come in with the mentality of
wanting to know the answer instead of
wanting to understand how it got to the
answer. Uh yeah, you kind of lose that
skill and you will sit down at at the
live poker table and I'm sure you see
maybe online kids sitting down with
their headphones on their phone. They're

[1:42:30]
their headphones on their phone. They're
not paying any attention. Uh because you
know they have already sort of an output
in their head, right? They they don't
see the value that you see in gathering
more information because for them it's
like what do you mean more information?
I'm going to make this decision. Well,
right. But like

[1:42:46]
right. But like
I think it's a question of definition,
right? Like you you said that
you don't find it like that what I'm
hearing is like I don't find it
intellectually stimulating to beat a
player that's worse than I and not me.

[1:43:01]
player that's worse than I and not me.
I'm saying the people right people in
general not not direct directing I'm you
know our our like avatar person over
here uh like like does that and to me
that just also exposes a lot of
information right like now all of a

[1:43:17]
information right like now all of a
sudden if you know that about someone
you know kind of their how they frame
things and what their mindset is and in
poker I think like one of the big also
bigger things is

[1:43:32]
bigger things is
you have kind of this it doesn't always
work out, but when it does it's
brilliant, especially live. Like you
have this kind of you can throw a lot of
monkey wrenches in there. Like I I I

[1:43:47]
monkey wrenches in there. Like I I I
play against theoretically stronger
players than myself all the time, right?
Like it's not my full-time thing, but I
still like to compete. So I got to find
innovative ways um staying competitive.
And like one of those is what are they

[1:44:00]
And like one of those is what are they
not paying attention to? And I think
like that can be like kind of a theme
that we keep like kind of pigging off
of. So like what are people not doing is
always more interesting than what people
are doing. So the person that is really

[1:44:15]
are doing. So the person that is really
theoretically strong. He might miss that
bill over here is [ __ ] stupid. he
still haven't gotten his coffee and he's
just going to like in his mind he's like
if I don't get my coffee I'm going to
shove any two
is to make a silly example right like

[1:44:30]
is to make a silly example right like
he's there and he's just like [ __ ] it
I'm all in like I didn't come for this
I'm I'm not here to win I'm here to to
like drink my coffee and and if I can't
get it I'll go get another one because
I'm just that rich like I'm in oil and

[1:44:45]
I'm just that rich like I'm in oil and
I'm in from Texas
So
now you have a pure threebat
and
you have a pure zero three bet. You use
flat like range. You change that

[1:45:01]
flat like range. You change that
parameter of Bill being more liable to
pump his stack in. But like even Bill
will be like, "Well, this guy three bet.
I don't want to look like a jackass,
right? Like I like I this is too like
I'll just wait for the next hand in his
mind." So

[1:45:18]
mind." So
the mindset of being like it's a limited
mindset that a lot of smart people have
of I don't find it interesting to to
solve things that that that are beneath

[1:45:31]
solve things that that that are beneath
me. Like that that's the the bigger
picture here from our avatar person.
They're too good for it. And I'm like
I'm not too good for it.
I'll take I'll take I'll take that stack
and maybe yours as well because the guy

[1:45:45]
and maybe yours as well because the guy
like you raise and the guy shoves and
you realize like he's been complaining
for the last 20 minutes and you're
probably going to stack off lighter and
here I am with like my super strong
flatting range and like maybe I only
three bet bluffs, right? Like all my
hands that I flat are like call calls

[1:46:00]
hands that I flat are like call calls
even against two opponents.
And how much did I gain? I don't know.
like probably a stack
and like you compare your win rate like
your BB00 to someone else's and now say

[1:46:15]
your BB00 to someone else's and now say
who's a wizard, right? Um so I think
like people are people and
if you're too good for it, I'm I'm happy
to be here to pick up the slack. I I
don't think necessarily too good. I feel
like it's more related to necessity. So

[1:46:31]
like it's more related to necessity. So
I feel like it's maybe a mindset of
like, oh, I'm sitting against the fish.
I'm already winning against him. So I
don't feel the necessity uh to put in
more attention that way, right? Because
you say necessity, I say entitlement.

[1:46:46]
Well, isn't isn't that a different
thing?
Yeah, I think I think it definitely is
like when you feel entitled to a p the
avatar person here would feel entitled
to win because they've studied, because

[1:47:00]
to win because they've studied, because
they know theory, because they're smart,
because like and and and they're pinging
that off someone else being worse,
right? Like that's the mindset, the core
mindset is like I'm better. Yeah. Yeah.
I get what you mean. Usually usually
when when I see this in players, I try

[1:47:16]
when when I see this in players, I try
to make the reframe of okay, it's not
about you winning. It's about you taking
the actual maximum possible. So I feel
like raising necessity usually for these
kind of players that have this problem
and trying to make it intellectual

[1:47:30]
and trying to make it intellectual
stimulating by seeing like all the you
know trying to make it interesting for
them. Okay, these are all types of
things that you can actually be doing
against recreational that you're
currently not doing. look at all the
things that are are are still possible,
you know, to make it interesting for
them. Uh, but I get what you mean, like

[1:47:46]
them. Uh, but I get what you mean, like
it comes from maybe an initial, well,
you know, like this this is not
interesting. I'm already winning. I'm
superior.
Yeah, 100%. And I think like if you
going back to our friend Jer, he done

[1:48:00]
going back to our friend Jer, he done
made a video for DTO Labs where it's
like playing against different fish
profiles. Amazing video. like really
entertaining and like he has his way of
mapping those players and making it into
and a couple of things. Yeah, I saw that
one. Yeah, that's good. Yeah. So, like

[1:48:15]
one. Yeah, that's good. Yeah. So, like
you make it into a fun game and then
like you know like our avatar guy might
think that that's silly and stupid and
it might be a way that works for him
instead. So like just figure out what
works. Um, and if you're going to work
with people in teams, it's like

[1:48:31]
with people in teams, it's like
figure out who's like-minded, who has
your sense of humor, who likes to create
content in a way that you relate to it,
right? Like I think I think that's also
um
yeah, like kind of a kind of a big deal

[1:48:46]
yeah, like kind of a kind of a big deal
that people just
discard like most like I don't know that
many poker players who really want to be
completely lonely. As a matter of fact,
like I haven't really like met anyone
that is that that much of a lone wolf.

[1:49:00]
that is that that much of a lone wolf.
They might say that they are, but people
like people. Um, and I think I think
it's a great thing to be able to
just step down from from that like

[1:49:15]
just step down from from that like
because it's lonely, right? Like if
you're the guy who has that mindset
coming into to like people notice, they
notice your energy. they know that you
kind of dare to just take their money
and you kind of got this chip on your
shoulder and and like the person who has

[1:49:30]
shoulder and and like the person who has
that mindset, they're actually, I would
say, kind of suffering from it and
making everyone else kind of miserable
at the same time. It's like someone bust
and there's a sigh of relief. Everyone's
like, "Okay, we can get back to having
fun, right?"
And and that kind of that kind of sucks,

[1:49:46]
And and that kind of that kind of sucks,
right? Like it it sucks for the person
who's that who's that guy. Um and I
think here again like if you want to
talk solutions
if you are more introvert you don't have
to like there's nothing wrong with you
but like think about what is my goal

[1:50:01]
but like think about what is my goal
like what I want and just going back to
also the life purpose type of like where
we kind of uh what I talked about
there's the life your life's purpose but
then there's also like a vision and when

[1:50:15]
then there's also like a vision and when
I have people come to me and they work
with me and they say I ask them like
what's your vision?
They usually say goals. Like what I get
back is like my vision are goals. It's
like a checklist of things that I need
to achieve. I'm like why? When they're

[1:50:32]
to achieve. I'm like why? When they're
like well because I want to feel
accomplished and that's how I do it,
right? And I'm like no, a vision is the
feeling that you want to have. A vision
is like
you can even take it as far as like how

[1:50:45]
you can even take it as far as like how
do I want like what is the feeling of
people being at my funeral is a really
good meditation to do. I'm sorry if
someone is afraid of death but spoiler
alert you know uh that that's a really
good way of framing things to make
decisions that you make that you do now

[1:51:01]
decisions that you make that you do now
to make them really matter. Um, and I I
think that
um, if you have a hard time doing that
with people and you don't know where to
start,
like you said, go to chatpt like ask it

[1:51:15]
like you said, go to chatpt like ask it
like, "Hey, I feel so and so." And you
can even talk to it, right? You can just
pick up your phone and you can say like,
"These are all the things." You can
bobble out something completely like
that feels incoherent to anyone else.
And then you say, "What does it mean?

[1:51:33]
And then you say, "What does it mean?
And it will, don't take it from me, take
it from Greg McHugh. And it will give
you something that is actually like,
hey, this is what you're experiencing
and here's what you can do about it.
Yeah. I can I can definitely speak from
from experience here as you know uh you

[1:51:48]
from experience here as you know uh you
know a little bit introverted here and
there, a little bit here and there. I
have one of my panels is uh is a
communication specialist. I gave him a
couple of communication frameworks and
every time I get into a a heated

[1:52:00]
every time I get into a a heated
argument with my wife, I go back and go
to Ched GP and like, hm, let me see what
my relationship coach is going to tell
me about this situation and how I can
best formulate this, you know. I've got
Listen, the nerds can really can really
learn something here, you know. So, you
can basically then I just type in how I

[1:52:15]
can basically then I just type in how I
feel and this it's very empathetic by
the way, Chad Gupt, okay? And then and
then it tells me exactly how to it it
sometimes even tells me, hey, you have a
certain need that's not met. I'm like,
oh, interesting insight. I I you know, I
was not in touch with that was that that
was actually going on, right? I'm just

[1:52:31]
was actually going on, right? I'm just
pissed. Uh so it really helps you with
that. And then it also gives you like it
even says like, do you want me to help
formulate how to better communicate this
to your wife? I'm like, sounds great,
you know, can you maybe also add some
flowers in there? You know, ju just do

[1:52:46]
flowers in there? You know, ju just do
the whole job straight away would be
great. But yeah, it's it's great help
actually. Yeah. And I and I and I love
that. I love how much you know you care
about your family and and like that
being your your primary objective,
right? Like it's always um

[1:53:02]
right? Like it's always um
like so beautiful to know what you care
about and then to take action, right?
Like what I hear is like I have a kid
and I want that for that experience to
be the best possible. So I learn, I
acquire knowledge, I then implement that

[1:53:15]
acquire knowledge, I then implement that
knowledge on a daily basis and I adjust,
right? Like to me there's nothing more
kind of um
that's that's the meaning of life,
right? Is to is to live your life um and
do the best you can. However, if you

[1:53:31]
do the best you can. However, if you
don't have the if you don't have the
communication skills though, sometimes
even though you're well intentioned, you
might not come across as being well
attentioned. So that's kind of where you
know my my my coach from Chad GPT he
really helps like translate your true

[1:53:45]
really helps like translate your true
intentions in a way that you know people
around you can actually understand that
you you're you know your intentions were
right. Just make sure that like when you
do that and at some point like he gives
you the right answer, you're going to be

[1:54:00]
you the right answer, you're going to be
like, "Not right now."
You know, like just just make sure to
have that aware like you're sitting
down, you're still kind of stewing,
right? Like and you have this thing and
you think you're ready to solve the
problem and and you get the answer, but

[1:54:15]
problem and and you get the answer, but
like just be able to have that like
human audacity to say, "You know what?
Chhatti who doesn't even have like a
human name like not right now I just
want to be pissed right like I think I
think it's like everything is contrast

[1:54:33]
think it's like everything is contrast
so so like you know you can't have black
with you can't have light without dark
like those two things are are are one
but without the within the it's all only

[1:54:45]
but without the within the it's all only
one in abs absence or in contrast with
the other one so I think like allowing
yourself to have that feeling of being
pissed is also allowing yourself to have
the feeling of love. I like that's a
spectrum. So once you are able to also

[1:55:04]
spectrum. So once you are able to also
respect yourself and and that
relationship and give yourself the time
to just process it, um you also that's
like part of your job, right? If I would
write a job description of being a
father, I'm not yet, but like if I

[1:55:17]
father, I'm not yet, but like if I
would, I'll be like, "Feel my feelings."
Like number one,
that would be like the one. And I I will
give a shout out to Jason Sue, who I've
been working with for a time. I think he
unlocked a lot of my

[1:55:31]
unlocked a lot of my
emotional performance in that sense.
Like I worked with him about a year ago
and now it's starting to seep in, right?
like performance has this lag where it's
like you do it and it just feels kind of
like weird and and hard and you might

[1:55:45]
like weird and and hard and you might
get some insights and nuggets of value
here and there, but then like a year
later
it's like putting money in the bank and
getting accumulative interest and one
day you go to your bank account and it's
like, "Oh, someone made a deposit." It's
like, "No, sir. That's just your
interest." Like you made this deposit a

[1:56:02]
interest." Like you made this deposit a
year ago and then you forgot that the
money was here.
So maybe like Adam, since you're a
performance coach and you kind of work
in in this realm, like what do you feel
are

[1:56:17]
are
the unmet challenges of a lot of players
that that come to you and and they're
struggling and they might, you know, on
a range from like complete ignorance and
and maybe that's bliss to a lot of
people to like

[1:56:33]
people to like
there's kind of this thing And I don't
know how to put words on it, but it's
kind of like this rock in my shoe that's
always there to like, oh, I'm completely
aware of the problem. I just don't want
to do anything about it. Uh right now

[1:56:46]
to do anything about it. Uh right now
because I I I don't know how. Um uh so
like what would be
the like I guess two things like the the
number one thing and then the thing that
you find that you're most curious about?

[1:57:00]
you find that you're most curious about?
Yeah, good question. So I'd say as you
mentioned there as well like there's
often a lag effect on performance when
you're working on yourself. One of the
challenges of mindsets is like sometimes
it's not direct in terms of the results
someone wants. I feel like most people
are trying to solve external problems to

[1:57:15]
are trying to solve external problems to
begin with. They want more money. They
want more success when really it's an
internal game that they're not really
aware of. They want to be happy. They
want to feel good in their environments.
They want good relationships. They want
to feel a nice internal state. But they
think they need to solve the external
problem. So they want to have the

[1:57:30]
problem. So they want to have the
external result as quickly as possible.
Give me the money, give me the high
stakes, give me the cars, the houses,
and they think that's going to be the
solution. So I think the the journey of
mindset and the work I do is often to
give them the awareness that actually
there's a bigger game going on. There's
an internal game that you're playing
alongside it. It's like the the paradox

[1:57:46]
alongside it. It's like the the paradox
of two games. One you think is
important, but it's not really. One's
really important, but you don't really
think it's important. And you're trying
to level up your character to achieve
your goals, and you feel like the way to
do that is to achieve the external
outcomes. on that journey as you're
evolving and get making growth you

[1:58:00]
evolving and get making growth you
realize oh wait a second there's
internal blockages mindset blockages
performance blockages and as you start
solving those you start getting that
external success like yeah this is great
at some point you realize the excess
external success wasn't really the main
journey and the main journey takes over
to the internal journey you're like

[1:58:15]
to the internal journey you're like
actually I've become a better version of
myself I show better I feel better wow
that's worth more than that money in the
bank account so yeah obviously there's
many aspects of things players come to
me with problems wise we could book the
mindset, we could buckle them
performance. But yeah, generally what I

[1:58:30]
performance. But yeah, generally what I
enjoy about my work is going deeper and
deeper into the internal uh journey and
the the where we all try to get to that
kind of happy feeling, feeling good
about ourselves. That often means being
able to perform. It often means being
able to uh show up in a way that we're
proud of. It means setting goals and

[1:58:45]
proud of. It means setting goals and
achieving them, having agency in our
worlds, but also not at the cost of our
internal landscape. Which actually leads
me nice segue to the next topic because
you mentioned your own things that
matter to you the most which were
optimal performance and longevity. And I

[1:59:00]
optimal performance and longevity. And I
I've been keen to dive into this the
whole conversation. So yeah, I want to
open up this doorway of optimal
performance to begin with and then we'll
branch into longevity but for you what
does optimal performance look like and
what are some of the key things that you
feel like you do that help you to

[1:59:15]
feel like you do that help you to
optimize your performance? I think
the best way to
might not be the best way, but I'll I'll
give it a shot anyways. Um, I think that
the best way to to kind of frame that is
is going back to

[1:59:32]
is going back to
to the feeling that I want, the the like
experience that that I that I desire.
Um, currently my my kind of like model
for that in terms of performance. So you

[1:59:45]
for that in terms of performance. So you
can bucket it into two like health and
performance. Um
the on the performance side I like my
go-to book is the art of learning by
Josh Watskins. Uh brilliant book. I just
can't get I can read it over and over
and I'll be equally fascinated each

[2:00:01]
and I'll be equally fascinated each
time. Um, so there's this moment where
he talks about his
him being competition is like one like
there's like uh like this Dune where you
have a faint within a faint. Like I like

[2:00:15]
have a faint within a faint. Like I like
that concept of just having something be
so subtle that you have to be completely
connected to what you do in order to
even know that it's there. And then you
can like lean into someone or like
create space for someone to lean into it

[2:00:31]
create space for someone to lean into it
and then like grapple them, right? It's
like like that context board really
really like high like super super high
level edges are like razor thin but
you're still looking for that thing that
um by any means like technical skills,

[2:00:48]
um by any means like technical skills,
mental skills, it's a very like deep
multi-layered game. Um what he followed
up followed that up with was his perform
like how he sees reality.
That was like the bigger thing where he

[2:01:01]
That was like the bigger thing where he
explains this like a like a camera like
a shutter where it's like
you know like you see like instead of
seeing reality as like a contin

[2:01:15]
where it's like there there there. So,
you're able to slow down time
while being in that state of like
physically I need to move something in

[2:01:31]
physically I need to move something in
order to have my opponent believe that
there's space there. Uh so that he will
go for the attack and based on that I
can kind of like create empty space for
him to fall into and I can grapple and

[2:01:46]
him to fall into and I can grapple and
like you know like time speeds up again.
Right?
That to me is so desirable, right? Like
like just talking about it gets me so
fired up that I'm like I want that and I

[2:02:00]
fired up that I'm like I want that and I
know myself well enough to know that I
won't be happy until I achieve more than
I don't feel like I have enough of that
in my life. Just to be really honest
with you, right? Um
and that makes me feel

[2:02:15]
and that makes me feel
frustrated.
It makes me feel sad. It makes me feel
uh angry and and kind of like lonely and
misunderstood because like that's the
feeling that I'm going for and that's

[2:02:30]
feeling that I'm going for and that's
like I know I'm setting the bar high
that my felt experience from that is um
yeah it's it's a pursuit, right? Um, so
I think from a performance aspect,
um, that would really be that would

[2:02:46]
um, that would really be that would
really be it so far. Maybe that
definition will change over time, right?
Like maybe in the future like I I get to
a place that's similar to that and and
then I want more and that's that's the
whole purpose, right? Like to have a
better experience of life that's more

[2:03:00]
better experience of life that's more
rich and more uh epic.
Yeah. Yeah, it sounds like it's this in
the flow of what you're doing to like a
real deep deep level where you're just
in sync with reality. I'm sure we all
can relate to to moments of like that. I

[2:03:16]
can relate to to moments of like that. I
think the examples you give were good in
terms of you feel like you know what's
happening. It sounds like you've slowed
things down enough to uh just be very in
sync with the moment like that very
present flow like state and as you touch
on as well we we all would like more of

[2:03:30]
on as well we we all would like more of
it and we there's not like a limit like
oh I've had too much being too present
I've been too in the flow of what's
happening and I think again yeah again
again give me more yeah I think it's
there's certain things that take us
there right and that's why certain
sports like adventure sports surfing

[2:03:45]
sports like adventure sports surfing
things that can the activity itself can
take us into a flow state poker itself
can be very immersive and take you're
into that. Then there's everyday life
where we also want to uh feel present,
feel connected, but there's less of a
performance goal. There's less of a I
need to uh almost exploit this situation
or make the most of it. I just want to

[2:04:01]
or make the most of it. I just want to
be present. So for you in terms of what
gets in the way of this kind of optimal
connection with the moment you're in?
What do you feel like prevents that
being more of a default state?
Oh my god. Like like do you have a list?

[2:04:18]
Oh my god. Like like do you have a list?
Let's go. Um, right. Like there there's
I mean that it's the whole thing that
I'm I'm building my business around is
to I'm building a business to

[2:04:31]
to I'm building a business to
put myself in the best position possible
to to achieve this while also, you know,
running a business and and making sure
that it's people, it's bills that needs
to be paid, there's communication,

[2:04:45]
to be paid, there's communication,
there's tools, we need to have strategy,
right? Like there's there's all these
um actions, but you can also call them
distractions, right? Like like you need
to have an like in order to get into

[2:05:00]
to have an like in order to get into
that kind of flow state. There's
different like there's also different
folks, different strokes from different
folks. So some people they thrive in a
more chaotic environment and that's
actually like their harmony. Um like
they they perform really really well.

[2:05:15]
they they perform really really well.
Um, so I think it's very individual like
how to how to get there. But there are
some common denominators, right? Like
things that
won't get you into flow is like pure
distractions. So like things that are

[2:05:30]
distractions. So like things that are
not a part of the thing that you
actually do. um that takes you out of
that zone because it's like
um you open your inbox and in order to
get retrieve some information and all of

[2:05:45]
get retrieve some information and all of
a sudden you see the email from Steve
who wants this like it's like the third
round of feedback on a topic that that
you're like oh my god like why doesn't
he get it and you're out of it right
like back to another 15 minutes of like
getting back into the zone. Um,

[2:06:05]
there's also other things like we all
act differently. So like for Renee, you
had this kind of like I worked really
well when I had back against the wall,
right? Like that's like a default that

[2:06:15]
right? Like that's like a default that
like pushes you to take action. Um,
for other people, back against the wall
might mean that they get into fight,
flight or freaks, right? Like you you're
you're a fight, right? like you pick
fight like I bike against the wall like

[2:06:30]
fight like I bike against the wall like
I'll punch my way out of it and you did
and and that's like super amazing um and
and something that you can always kind
of like know about yourself like one of
the questions I wanted to ask you guys
maybe we can like do this later but like

[2:06:45]
maybe we can like do this later but like
when was the last time you felt really
accomplished and I bet you Renee if I'm
if I may that like when you did that you
did feel really accomplished right like
because you achieved it you fought your
way out of like a pretty dire situation
and and that's amazing. So,

[2:07:02]
and and that's amazing. So,
um
knowing yourself in that way uh means
that
you can you can actually make some
pretty accurate predictions, right? Like
in so and so environment when so and so

[2:07:16]
in so and so environment when so and so
happens and so and so goes wrong, I will
predictably act this way. And like for
me when I when my resources are not
meeting my demands my default is freaks
right like I I had a startup uh before

[2:07:30]
right like I I had a startup uh before
this in performance nutrition
uh first time founder startup we made
all the mistakes like all the mistakes
in the book just did them all
and at some point resources weren't
meeting demands there's too many things

[2:07:46]
meeting demands there's too many things
going on we have too big of an operation
it's all going to [ __ ]
and I'm there
working like 24/7. It feels like I'm I'm
working or I'm sleeping and at the end
of a day I could have this felt

[2:08:01]
of a day I could have this felt
experience of like, oh yeah, what about
that? And I'm like, wait, did I do that
today or yesterday? You know, like it's
like it's like the the polar opposite of
the experience of Josh Watkins being in
like the shutter speed. Like this is the

[2:08:17]
like the shutter speed. Like this is the
literal polar opposite, right? like I'm
there and I don't even know what
happened when. Like so that's how far
your range can be from how you perceive
time. And that to me was my wakeup call,

[2:08:30]
time. And that to me was my wakeup call,
right? That was the first time when I
when I had that I'm like, "Oh [ __ ] like
this isn't going where it's supposed to
go." And
I was kept being bombarded with admin
and I def like I default to sitting
there and just being I wonder what's one

[2:08:46]
there and just being I wonder what's one
thing that I do moderately well that I
can do that makes me feel productive. So
which is like definition of pseudo
productivity.
Um,
and if I would have had a better support
system to guide me and to to kind of

[2:09:01]
system to guide me and to to kind of
pull me out of that. For me, I I respond
really well to questions, right? Like
that's one of my defaults that when
someone asks me like, "Hey, how are
you?" Or like, "Hey, I'm feeling like
this isn't going where we want it to go.
Like, let's sit down and talk about it.
What do you think?" I'll be like, "You

[2:09:15]
What do you think?" I'll be like, "You
snap me out of that in a second."
But at that time, I didn't really have
that support system, or at least not
like often enough, right? because people
have this idea of me as being someone
who
um

[2:09:31]
um
he's got it right like he's always good.
He's a guy who's always good. And little
did they know that like at this point I
wasn't. But I didn't have a way clear
way to express that because I was going
into my default. So it's like a very

[2:09:45]
into my default. So it's like a very
extreme example for things that could
get you into the exact opposite
direction. Um, but on a more daily
basis, it's more distractions. It's
stuff that gets in the way. It's a
bottleneck that I have to deal with on a

[2:10:02]
bottleneck that I have to deal with on a
tool that I'm not familiar with. Like,
I'm trying to like figure out how to do
an automation and I can't log into my
pro Instagram account. Like, you know,
it's like those type of things where I
get really frustrated. Um,

[2:10:18]
get really frustrated. Um,
and I'm frustrated because I don't get
to have my time of doing the things
where I know I could provide more bad,
right? Like that that to me is um, and
my challenge is how to individualize

[2:10:30]
my challenge is how to individualize
that. My challenge is to how to set up a
system that works for just about anyone
while acquiring data so that we can more
accurately predict what you need and
solving like all the pain points. Like
not many people like to do their taxes,
right? like this is like, okay, so we we

[2:10:46]
right? like this is like, okay, so we we
take care of the boring stuff. Um
uh so yeah, that's that's like a little
introduction to to me and my my flirt
with burnout. I never really burn out
because I have excellent habits and I
keep showing up for them. It's like I I

[2:11:00]
keep showing up for them. It's like I I
do my workout in the morning. I do my
meditation, although at the time I
probably should just gone and punched a
punching bag. And I will give you the
end of the story in spot, right? I was
in Vegas.
It's I I busted I think I busted like 20

[2:11:16]
It's I I busted I think I busted like 20
bullets in a row. And it wasn't for
playing bad, but sometimes the universe
has this way of kind of conspiring
against you to really like put you on
your ass.
Uh and I at one like I I've been getting

[2:11:31]
Uh and I at one like I I've been getting
also ripped because two weeks like for
two weeks I just like hit the gym at
5:00 p.m. for my second workout of the
day. And I'm there one day. It's like a
247 gym. um that we have a that we have
in Vegas. And uh

[2:11:47]
in Vegas. And uh
I I was there by myself and I look at
this punching bag and I'm like I see
myself and I said I should be so pissed
right now because everything is going to
[ __ ] and I should go punch that punching
bag. And the punching bag was looking

[2:12:00]
bag. And the punching bag was looking
back at me and saying like, "Yeah, but
you don't got shit."
And I'm like, "Yeah, you're right." So,
I use my policy and I have this policy,
right? Like I sometimes it's better to

[2:12:16]
right? Like I sometimes it's better to
just give up. Like let's face it, we've
all been there. And like the sooner we
can realize that you're you're just not
this is not what you're supposed to be
doing, the more sid time you save
yourself and everyone else in the
process. And this was my like

[2:12:31]
process. And this was my like
it's not working. I'm going to give
myself a day and I'm going to give up.
And I just went home and I slept. That's
what I did. I just went to bed and I
slept for probably like 10 hours and the
next day I called my team and I said,
"Listen guys,

[2:12:47]
"Listen guys,
it's not working and I'm not willing to
do what it takes to make this work
because I don't have it right now." Like
I'm I'm sorry in a in a different way in
different world uh we could have made

[2:13:01]
different world uh we could have made
it. I really appreciate all the hard
work that you put in. And then I tried
to give everyone the best landing that
we could. And then I got back to
rebuilding my energy uh to figure out
what went what I what did I learn from

[2:13:15]
what went what I what did I learn from
this process uh if I do it again, how
could I do it better? Um and just yeah
getting getting my energy back. But the
real cost here is time. Um
my well-being, my relationships with

[2:13:31]
my well-being, my relationships with
people that were strained by this,
right? like it's real life actions and
consequences and um thankfully, you
know, we're all adults and we all dealt
with this in in a good way. But
ultimately, that's what I'm looking for

[2:13:45]
ultimately, that's what I'm looking for
people to employ because this could have
been so easily avoided. It's like if I
would have had someone there to kind of
like guide me and navigate my myself
through this process and also give me
like systems and tools that are actually
working instead of listening to like a

[2:14:00]
working instead of listening to like a
thousand people's advice.
uh and I scrambling to find a way. Um I
think that's also just to plug AI again
because that's been kind of the like one
of the themes of this conversation.
That's another use case, right? Like you

[2:14:15]
That's another use case, right? Like you
can you can
really help that kind of uh jumpstart um
a process or or like remove a lot of the
administrative burdens. But if you try

[2:14:31]
administrative burdens. But if you try
to do it yourself, you just be like me.
You'll be you'll be frustrated and you
can't log into your Instagram and
there's all these bottlenecks and all of
a sudden you end up doing admin instead
of doing your job. Like you want to be a
high stakes poker player. You want to be
like Steven Chitwick, right? Like Stevie

[2:14:45]
like Steven Chitwick, right? Like Stevie
is not there in building all of these
things. At least I don't think so. Maybe
he is. I'm just like he wouldn't be my
client. Um so so yeah. Um,

[2:15:01]
client. Um so so yeah. Um,
yeah. I think I think that the the the
biggest thing to solve is for people to
be more successful and happy and to do
that in their own way and and remove all
the stuff that's not their zone of
genius because that's the that's the

[2:15:15]
genius because that's the that's the
missing component, right? Like if you
want to get into flow, you need to be in
in the your zone of genius. And then all
the all the small stuff that you then
have to do like the 20% of stuff that
you're actually not good at but you have
to do anyways. Now you have the energy
to do it and you'll feel so

[2:15:30]
to do it and you'll feel so
accomplished.
You feel so accomplished when you did
that thing. You pushed yourself and like
[ __ ] didn't like this but now I'm an
expert at like
setting up a marketing funnel
automation.
Like you never thought that that would

[2:15:46]
Like you never thought that that would
be the thing that would give you that
sense of gratification. And again, it's
just like self-esteem. That's something
that you can only get for yourself
because
even if someone else would give it to
you, you wouldn't want them to.

[2:16:02]
you, you wouldn't want them to.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I think it took that
answer in so many interesting directions
which I want to just like underline some
points as well cuz we're all fighting
the same battle of trying to do deep
work and meaningful work and we're
fighting the distractions of everyday

[2:16:15]
fighting the distractions of everyday
life. Stimulus, dealing with people,
dealing with email, deal with
notifications, Discord communities
popping off, people want attention and
it's only feels like it's getting more
and more dialed up. So, if we're not
proactively taking steps to protect
that, distraction becomes the default or
at least like busy work becomes the

[2:16:31]
at least like busy work becomes the
default. So, we've got to be really
cautious and mindful of how to carve out
this work. I really like the book Deep
Work by Cal Newport that really
implanted in my mind for for a long long
time how important it is to protect like
blocks, 90-minute blocks I do where I'm

[2:16:46]
blocks, 90-minute blocks I do where I'm
uninterrupted. I'm off the grid. You
can't contact me. There's no
distractions in my world. So, I can
focus deeply because as you mentioned,
you you've got to control your
environment. If not, something that's
not related will come up. And I feel
like the default now is if you haven't
protected time, it will get eaten up or

[2:17:01]
protected time, it will get eaten up or
something will come up that will
distract you. So you got to think in
your day is most people listening poker
players when are you going to study is
the kind of deep work you'll do. And how
can you have an uninterrupted time and
kind of protect that? If not, you'll end
up yeah being distracted. And yeah, I

[2:17:15]
up yeah being distracted. And yeah, I
think working on our own projects, we're
all trying to achieve our own goals. And
we need to make sure we're kind of
carving out our own own time to to get
into this flow state as you were talking
about and trying to get those moments of
high production and yeah similar I think
the things you mentioned I relate to

[2:17:30]
the things you mentioned I relate to
more as well in terms of learning new
things setting up new systems that I
didn't relate to as I would get pleasure
from but as my goals have evolved yeah
my deep works also evolved with that.
Now you mentioned something about giving
up and this kind of pushed back on
myself cuz I feel like I don't give up

[2:17:46]
myself cuz I feel like I don't give up
enough. So, one of my things is I I kind
of push through stuff. I'm kind of a bit
of a fighter at heart and I kind of
pride myself in resilience to the to a
detriment sometimes. And that give up
button like is almost like I know it's
there sometimes, but I just don't like
to press it. And I think you mentioned

[2:18:00]
to press it. And I think you mentioned
one of your high points in the
questionnaire, consistently sticking to
my given up policy all these years. So,
I'm curious to know what this giving up
policy is, where it gives you kind of
freedom to get out of things that you
shouldn't be doing, and yeah, maybe for
myself, how I could learn from that to

[2:18:15]
myself, how I could learn from that to
uh give myself my own give up button,
right? Um,
I mean number one is just to to give
yourself permission to to like just you
know like the the the one notion is to

[2:18:31]
know like the the the one notion is to
and again I would credit Jason Seir
because I learned this from him like his
his introduction was becoming the kind
of person who does what I want the way
that I want to and if someone asked me
why is because I want to.

[2:18:45]
why is because I want to.
So like that's number one, right? like
no one else is going to be able to uh to
to grant you that permission. Uh so I
think like that's the that's the kind of
like precursor.
Um then the second part I think it's

[2:19:02]
being a man can be kind of a problem at
times, right? like we've been taught
forever that this is how you're supposed
to deal with something and and it's kind
of

[2:19:15]
of
dogmatic in a sense, right? Like you're
you're born as a man and you're supposed
to be like fill in the blank like
whatever belief that you've grown up
with. Um so I think like part of that is
to also uh redefine what that means for

[2:19:33]
to also uh redefine what that means for
a lot of people. Not everyone. A lot of
people like are in touch with like who
they are and they're completely fine
with it. They have that like kind of
awareness. Uh but I think just getting
curious about that is is like a really

[2:19:46]
curious about that is is like a really
that's the work uh to define that for
you and not letting everyone else step
on that. Um and then I think we can get
to
uh kind of the the meat and potatoes uh

[2:20:00]
uh kind of the the meat and potatoes uh
of of what it is that that we're
actually doing.
which is we're creating a strategy for
ourselves. We're creating like a like a
like a fail safe like you're you're
taking this track and you're going down

[2:20:15]
taking this track and you're going down
um a maze and at some point you realize
that that the maze is never ending.
There's no way out. Like you just
literally can't win the maze and the
best way to to go through like the best
way to what the only thing you can do

[2:20:31]
way to what the only thing you can do
now is hit the eject button. And there's
like this red button that you have there
and it's just just going to fall through
the floor and it's going to be scary as
[ __ ] right? Like it's sorry I don't
know if like I'm good to swear on the
podcast but it'll be like the scariest

[2:20:45]
podcast but it'll be like the scariest
thing that you do because it's all your
fears are perceived like down there.
But the other alternative is to continue
running down this maze forever. And
that's even more unbearable.

[2:21:00]
that's even more unbearable.
So
what I'm kind of hinting at here is like
if you're already prepared like I'm
entering this and I think I'm going to
make it through the maze and just going
back to first principle thinking like
another way of saying it is like I'm
going to what's the clo what's the

[2:21:15]
going to what's the clo what's the
fastest way of going from point A to
point B in like you know this like games
where you have a maze and you try to
take a ball through it and people will
be like well it's like this and this and
this and it's like no it's actually it's
like going around the whole thing I like
you don't you just don't take the the

[2:21:31]
you don't you just don't take the the
course like you do you do something else
entirely or like you jump over it would
be another one like that's that's a good
way to explain lateral thinking. Um
you're much more likely to hit the deck

[2:21:45]
you're much more likely to hit the deck
button earlier when you have clear
goals, clear objectives and clear kind
of rules for yourself. So like here are
my values, here are my beliefs, here is
my vision, my mission, my purpose. Um

[2:22:02]
my vision, my mission, my purpose. Um
and from that I can clearly articulate
what works for me and what doesn't,
right? like yeah you can even do like
more
uh you can take a more robust approach

[2:22:15]
uh you can take a more robust approach
and you can do like a personality test
and and from that you can also drive
some insights of like what works and
what doesn't and then from that you
craft like what would be something that
I would think is suitable for me to do.

[2:22:30]
I would think is suitable for me to do.
So like for me my strategy was to like
whenever things go so wrong that there's
nothing like either it's like external
circumstances like you know uh there's
like 13 allins in a row. I think I
mentioned it in your in your in your
questionnaire before but like I had a

[2:22:46]
questionnaire before but like I had a
final table in Florida where I I was the
bubble boy went like a 25k was like
really really big. Uh and it was 13
allins before me and every single person
survived and then it was my turn and I
could just feel it. I'm like a Scotty

[2:23:01]
could just feel it. I'm like a Scotty
and and I and I busted and that day used
to take like a silly example of this. I
just gave up, right? Like I used I used
say goodbye to everyone uh in in a like
polite manner and everyone was there
like, "Wow, this guy really got [ __ ]

[2:23:17]
like, "Wow, this guy really got [ __ ]
you know, like he really got like
there's there he was the guy today." And
I just walked out. I threw my whatever
midnight coffee in in the trash can at
3:00 in the morning and I went upstairs

[2:23:31]
3:00 in the morning and I went upstairs
and I told my friends like, "How do you
go?" I'm like, "I don't want to talk
about it.
I I just want to like I'm just going to
plug in my earphones and I'm going to
listen to some music and I'll see you
tomorrow."

[2:23:45]
tomorrow."
And I gave up, right? And and the next
day I woke up and I felt great and I met
some of the people that I played the FT
with and I was all smiles and they're
like, "Man, like you really got fucked."
I'm like, "Yeah, but I'm good." Would I
have been good if I kept like holding on
to that and feeling like it was just

[2:24:02]
to that and feeling like it was just
unfair and um this wasn't right? Like
was I unlucky? Is that a fact? True. Now
what? So what? Who cares about your
story? That's the past.
Um, so I think that right like to get

[2:24:17]
Um, so I think that right like to get
more pragmatic and practical and like
something for you that you can take away
is think about the like the story and
the narrative where I am and then like
what are the things that I want to
achieve and then mirror that from an

[2:24:30]
achieve and then mirror that from an
action plan and have the deck but button
ready or parachute or however you choose
to design it so that when the day comes
even if it's scary you're going to be so
much more likely to press it because if
not, you might like if to take the

[2:24:45]
not, you might like if to take the
parachute, you might just like go all
the way down, right? Uh yeah. Or or like
release it too late might be a better
way to say it. Um yeah. Yeah. Yeah. As
you were speaking there, I was thinking
about a lot of things. Uh but one thing

[2:25:00]
about a lot of things. Uh but one thing
that came to mind was resisting almost
like resisting the moments like the the
giving up. It's not not like a passive
thing. It's almost like ah I accept
what's happened and I'm stop fighting
it. It's almost like you're swimming up
current and the current's so strong and
you're just really swimming against it

[2:25:15]
you're just really swimming against it
and you're like, "Ah, you can just relax
and go with it." You're just resisting
the whole time. And then my thoughts
about that, why that's challenging to
stop resisting is what you lose cuz
you've you've almost like put your
identity into like getting this goal.
You've got a lot of emotional attachment

[2:25:30]
You've got a lot of emotional attachment
to it. You start the pursuit because it
was meaningful and exciting and now you
got to let that go. And for me, I've got
this like overly optimistic side of
time. So I'm like, I can find a way out.
There must be a back door. There's I'll
dig a new hole. There's I've dug 20, but
there must be a 21st. And then I'll

[2:25:45]
there must be a 21st. And then I'll
convince myself that if I'm over
optimistic that I can get round it when
in reality I'm just swimming against the
current over and over. So as you
speaking there, I thought the kind of
main stop loss for me, stop loss to use
a poker term, h would be to understand
my values at a high level and go when

[2:26:00]
my values at a high level and go when
when am I compromising my values to
achieve this other thing? when am I like
as you mentioned with the the business
you set up your health was suffering
your relationships might be suffering as
well and you putting yourself in a
detrimental state like things were
compounding upwards to the point where
you're like I don't know how to get out

[2:26:15]
you're like I don't know how to get out
of it and is the goal even worth trying
to get out of I think that's where this
kind of comes very practical and I think
for myself relaying what you said
understanding where I'm resisting and
then where it starts uh compromising
some of my values and then what do I
lose and can I be brave enough to give

[2:26:30]
lose and can I be brave enough to give
up and just see okay this is gone that
dream you
It's gone. All gone. No worries. And
then start from something new. And then
knowing which I I've got better at like
something else will appear. Like on once
you say no to something else, one door
closes, another one opens. You don't
know that in advance because obviously
you've got a limited amount of attention

[2:26:45]
you've got a limited amount of attention
span. But when you stop doing one thing
with your time, other opportunities
arise and often it's the next vehicle
what you are supposed to go into which
is which is more aligned. So yeah, that
fits in really well. So yeah, I'm glad
you covered that one. So I wanted to
cover now a little bit about health
because we've touched on it on the
surface.

[2:27:01]
surface.
Before before we go into the next part,
I'm actually quite curious. So Renee, if
you'll if you'll humor me here. So like
since you're a fighter and you fought
your way out of this and like that's you
know huge strength like can you think of

[2:27:15]
know huge strength like can you think of
a time where you like that strength of
yours ended up biting you in the ass
like little or little or big? Yeah, I I
actually I actually wrote this down but
then actually Adam went on to the next
topic. So actually was good that that
you pointed out because I was going to
interrupt Adam but then he straight away

[2:27:31]
interrupt Adam but then he straight away
went to the hell. I was like okay never
mind. I'll let it go. But I actually
wrote down because I had a similar
experience and or at least the
experience that I had. It was like a
conflict in belief. There was like a
belief or an identity that built in me
maybe through that time that kind of

[2:27:46]
maybe through that time that kind of
said hey you you you can make anything
happen right you can do anything as long
as you know keep going at it. So at some
point actually it was in in trying to
scale the previous coaching business
right right now we have the mechanics of
poker which we have shaped now in a way

[2:28:03]
poker which we have shaped now in a way
that it suits my needs right and it's it
I can do exactly what I want to do but
before that it was poker ambition and
you know I was doing this and just like
in poker I was like well I'm not just
going to do this for doing this when

[2:28:16]
going to do this for doing this when
we're going to do this we're going to
try to be the best right gonna be the
next upswing poker whatever whatever
And that's just, you know, a mindset.
Oh, when you do something, you have to
do it big, a belief, and then like you
can make anything work. So when [ __ ]
happens, well, you don't quit because

[2:28:31]
happens, well, you don't quit because
you can make anything work. But then,
you know, stress, blah, blah, blah. Uh,
and at some point, I think I had a call
with my friend to tell me like, "Yeah, I
I know I know you can make that happen,
but what's the why? What's what's the

[2:28:45]
but what's the why? What's what's the
what's the purpose in the end? How is it
going to how is going to suit your
life?" And I was like, "Huh?" And then I
think I had another call actually with
uh with actually an ex student of mine
and he was explaining that uh I think he
had a couple of language schools in

[2:29:00]
had a couple of language schools in
Spain and he says listen you know I just
have schools and it's fine like this you
know and they generate me money and I
can do all the other things that I want.
I don't have to make this the biggest
language school in in Spain. Why would I
do that? Then I can no longer live my

[2:29:15]
do that? Then I can no longer live my
dayto-day life in the way that I want. I
was like, "Huh, wait. So, I'm actually
not doing all these things and I'm
stressed out, blah, blah, but it's not
really serving my purpose." And
actually, there was a big that's how we
kind of we we changed our whole program.
We changed the way we do coaching and

[2:29:30]
We changed the way we do coaching and
now I spend my time doing the things I
actually like to do, right? So, now I
think he said like how can the business
help you uh instead of it basically
hurting you. So, uh yeah, good actually
that you brought that up. So for me it
was more realizing that I have a very

[2:29:46]
was more realizing that I have a very
strong identity linked to that I can
make everything work but there's no
point in in trying to reforce that or
just not everything is worth you know
figuring out and and and resolving right

[2:30:00]
figuring out and and and resolving right
and I think I mean thanks for thanks for
sharing right because I didn't want to
like step off the topic um and just
making it into like we're all heroes
right like My story was one of failing
and yours was one of success. But then

[2:30:17]
and yours was one of success. But then
like my story of failing has led me to
feeling a lot more success like I like I
went on to the next thing and I did the
work and I learned from this experience.
Yeah. same and like you exactly so like

[2:30:30]
Yeah. same and like you exactly so like
like it's all I like the story of the
farmer and good thing bad thing who
knows you know uh I think it's very
humbling and and another
you know feel free to steal this anyone
right like things will always change is

[2:30:45]
right like things will always change is
a mantra that that you can use just
every single time like you're flying
high things are going well uh money is
falling on you and like Eddie Murphy
like there's It's like, oh, that's
that's mine. That's mine. Like, thank
you very much. Like, things are going

[2:31:00]
you very much. Like, things are going
great. Enjoy it. Celebrate it. But be
aware that that too is impermanent. And
even more so when things are tough,
right? Like, here's right. Here's for
the people out there that are really,
really struggling. I bet there's like

[2:31:16]
really struggling. I bet there's like
some people that would listen to this
that will be like,
"Yeah, not feeling it." Right? Uh, and
that's okay. like just just like take
comfort in the fact that that too will
change as long as you keep putting one

[2:31:31]
change as long as you keep putting one
foot in front of another and doing
something about it. Um, and look at what
you could miss if you don't, right? Like
look at the other alternative, the other
outcome, the other trajectory that you

[2:31:46]
outcome, the other trajectory that you
could take that you would miss by not
taking one step. And I think that's
really profound, right? Like so um also
just like to to bring it back to to you
Adam in terms of like that
if you think about the escape thing as

[2:32:02]
if you think about the escape thing as
just one step it makes it a whole lot
less scary to to take it and not like
identify with that whole story and
feeling like the universe will collapse
on you because you you you say no I

[2:32:15]
on you because you you you say no I
don't want that like somehow we I feel
like we kind of forget that we have the
right as like being born you have the
right to say no to things and that
that's that's your choice ultimately.
So, so I think like something

[2:32:32]
So, so I think like something
to kind of meditate over and and to just
just decide, right? Like going back to
become the kind of person and then like
repeat that for for a lot of times I had
just we we would get to the to the other

[2:32:46]
just we we would get to the to the other
part. Um I think like a good way to also
do it is to change the input, right?
Like the definition of insanity is to do
the same thing over and over and expect
a different outcome. Why do we do that?
because we're trying to use the same
script over and over. We try to ask the

[2:33:00]
script over and over. We try to ask the
same question, the same prompt. And if
you now put in new questions, the output
will look vastly different. You're going
to gain a new perspective or a new
insight. And that's something that you
can actually practically use. So I think
that's a good one. Um, you know, educate

[2:33:15]
that's a good one. Um, you know, educate
yourself. Uh, learn about different
types of fallacies like some cost
fallacy and and these type of things so
you know like, hey, this is what my
brain is trying to do. Um, and that way
you have a another layer of protection.
Uh, it's like kind of like having an

[2:33:30]
Uh, it's like kind of like having an
anti virus in in your in your computer.
Probably a good idea if you have
sensitive information. Um, and what you
said Renee, right? Like ask ask yourself
why. I why am I doing this? Why why why?
If you ask yourself why five times, you

[2:33:46]
If you ask yourself why five times, you
can try this. It's a really fun
exercise.
It's like, you know, that Louis CK
sketch or is that he's canceled now, I
guess, but Louis CK sketch where where
he's like his kid is asking him like
why, you know, like why is the sky blue?

[2:34:01]
why, you know, like why is the sky blue?
And he's like, well, because, you know,
it works, right? It really works to ask
yourself why once you asked it five
times. And again, like use case for AI,
you do the five Ws. just call a five
wise analysis and you get to the bottom

[2:34:16]
wise analysis and you get to the bottom
of every problem which is also a great
way to to like build a product because
that way you can come to like is it is
this something that I think is a good
idea or do people have this actual
problem you ask why why why and then the
fifth why is like and here's why it's a

[2:34:31]
fifth why is like and here's why it's a
good or a bad idea
so a little shortcut uh that you can
take and um
yeah yeah that's uh just some I I think
it was a really really good topic and

[2:34:45]
it was a really really good topic and
I'm happy you brought it up Adam. It's
like very very good questions and and I
think it's very relatable right like we
we're all here like relating on this
experience that is quite challenging uh
wanting to be high performing and and
kind of stumbling on ourselves. So what

[2:35:03]
kind of stumbling on ourselves. So what
was your next it was about like health
and and like this health side and
longevity side of performance. Yeah, I
I'll wrap this one up in a bowl and then
I'll we'll go into the next one. But
yeah, I think as you mentioned there as
well, it's almost like knowing which

[2:35:16]
well, it's almost like knowing which
which goals to pursue like what we're
trying to achieve and then when we kind
of stray off course like maybe we set a
clear direction to begin with but like
over time we realize that this goal is
not going to work like you start in the
business and a new founder like yes
we're going to change the world rene

[2:35:34]
so pure it's so inspired then as you
start going you're like we've kind of we
started on this track and now we're
we're over here it's like the goal is
try to get back onto that track but in
reality It's like h maybe I'm chasing
the wrong thing. It reminds me I think

[2:35:46]
the wrong thing. It reminds me I think
it was 0ero to one by Peter Teal when he
talks about like the importance of
knowing the games that are worth
playing. He goes all right to be a chess
grandmaster might take you 10 years if
you're incredibly incredibly smart. Is
it worth playing? Do you want that? Do
you want those 10 years? You're good at

[2:36:00]
you want those 10 years? You're good at
chess 10 years. Was it worth all the
sacrifice? So trying to get that deep
root of what games am I playing and are
they worth playing for your own reasons
and really trying to understand that.
Yeah, I like those five W's to uh get
past that kind of surface level answers
and go deeper and deeper and deeper. So
yeah, I know we could go forever on this

[2:36:16]
yeah, I know we could go forever on this
topic because it's so uh um I wanted to
open up a doorway on impermanence as
well because you mentioned that word and
it's a it's a key word for me as well.
So we could go deep on that but I want
to go back to a little bit about health
because we did touch on it but we didn't
go super practical and I know you've
done a lot of things around health and

[2:36:30]
done a lot of things around health and
you take it very seriously. I think the
audience could learn a lot from
practices you found useful. So I know
you've done meditation, breath work, you
do a lot of fitness stuff, you are big
into nutrition so big that you started
your own nutrition company to provide
high quality, high performing meals. So

[2:36:46]
high quality, high performing meals. So
uh yeah, I'm curious to know for you
what things do you feel are the most
important or the practices that are most
important for you to feel healthy in
your body and perform at your best.
I'll start with a fundamental truth that

[2:37:00]
I'll start with a fundamental truth that
I'm it's so glaringly obvious like a lot
of the really big insights I think are
like they're right there in front of us
all the time and then uh it just dawned
on me one day that
all we are is our nutrition

[2:37:18]
and I'm like
what
you know there's this sense of like
What? And then
you hear the slot machine in Vegas. It's

[2:37:31]
you hear the slot machine in Vegas. It's
just like bing bing bing bing bing bing
bing. Like all the all the money is
starting to come out of the machine and
you're like, "Oh my god, we just hit the
jackpot,
right?" Like
I think that if I would have had the

[2:37:48]
if I would have had the bandwidth to
take multiple steps back when I was
running the nutrition company, that's
that would have been something that I
would have built the concept around
because that's robust. Like that's

[2:38:01]
because that's robust. Like that's
something that you can't really like
argue with. It's like facts and it's
strong and and it it like hits home for
everyone and like that way you don't
have to change someone's mind. You just
have to illuminate the problem that they

[2:38:15]
have to illuminate the problem that they
have in order for them to become aware
and then your job is to understand who
is your not just your customers but who
are your fans, right? Like who are the
people that resonate with like what you
stand for and the way that you do it and

[2:38:30]
stand for and the way that you do it and
how can you get more of them because
they will be the people that kind of
like informs you of what you should be
doing but also being the people that are
your biggest advocates and that pushes

[2:38:45]
your biggest advocates and that pushes
um not your product I think is too
shallow like your your pushes your
vision forward and that's something that
you want to get people involved in right
and and like um and I mean like there's

[2:39:00]
and and like um and I mean like there's
so many topics that I could unpack like
I keep like my right now it's like 2025
and personal branding and aligning that
with your company's brand. I think
that's like a really big one to do but
you can't do that if you don't stand for
something if you don't have a voice. Um,

[2:39:17]
something if you don't have a voice. Um,
and that voice needs to be something
that's grounded in some in a concept
that people care about and relate to
because if not, they won't get what
you're doing. And people don't like to
be made feel stupid. They don't like to
feel stupid. So, um, just being like

[2:39:34]
feel stupid. So, um, just being like
giving a little and I think like nugget
uh on that I I think is um can be
valuable. Um when it comes to my my

[2:39:46]
valuable. Um when it comes to my my
personal performance
um
it's it's an ongoing struggle. Like um
that's the best way I can put it.
There's so many things that I either

[2:40:01]
There's so many things that I either
want or I think I want that are not
healthy for me that are just like the
distractions.
Um, there's so many traps that are
always there that that are like easy

[2:40:15]
always there that that are like easy
options. They taste good. They're filled
with chemicals that will make my
microbiome
um not operate the way they should,
which will lead my gut to tell me I'm
hungry all the time, which will lead me

[2:40:30]
hungry all the time, which will lead me
to eat more crap. And here we go again.
Right? So like just like social media, I
don't trust my my um my brain to like
let that do the ex like the governing
like have that being my governing organ.

[2:40:45]
like have that being my governing organ.
I kind of trust my gut, but I need for
that to be clean because going back to
the fundamental truth of like I am all I
am is um my metabolism. Once I can start
there,

[2:41:01]
there,
it fuels my engine. It builds me, right?
Like it it's what gets my
um gets me to have serotonin in my brain
or not.
And
so when I have that insight, it's like

[2:41:16]
so when I have that insight, it's like
it's so profound, right? It's like
that's like the the engine of my life.
Um that really helped me like that
really like served me in a way where I
could now mirror all my decisions when

[2:41:31]
could now mirror all my decisions when
it comes to my health, my performance,
my longevity through that one thing that
I try to nourish. And then like I'm not
always succeeding,
right? Like I too some days just eat a

[2:41:46]
right? Like I too some days just eat a
bunch of crap and just like with
meditation
the whole point is to congratulate
yourself when you realize that you're
doing something that you actually don't
want to do. Like I have this agreement
with myself like this is not what I
wanted to do. So having something

[2:42:02]
wanted to do. So having something
written down on your actual goals and
something that you can use as like a
guiding north
um and put it in a place where you won't
forget it or have a friend like have
someone that that you have some

[2:42:15]
someone that that you have some
accountability with and it's like hey
man did you forget about this thing and
you're like
maybe
you know um
so I try to think about my my
performance s just like I do with my

[2:42:31]
performance s just like I do with my
brain. Like I I don't trust it. So I I
try to put up as many safeguards as
possible, surround myself with people
that are like-minded.
Um I decided to give up drinking for
like I'm not having alcohol for a year.
And actually that's a really good one.

[2:42:46]
And actually that's a really good one.
Um I learned this from Greg Mchuan. He
was on Tim Fer's and he said that people
default to making to going back on like
the resolutions because they start like
having a negotiation and if you have a

[2:43:00]
having a negotiation and if you have a
negotiation with yourself
you're going to lose, right? Like that's
the
one way or another there's no winner
here. There's just like a loser and a
winner and they're both yourself. So,

[2:43:15]
winner and they're both yourself. So,
um, removing the negotiation can be an
extremely practical tip and it it was
like I was so shocked because it seems
so it seems so like stupidly simple
almost but then I I started implementing
this for myself and I'm like h it just

[2:43:33]
this for myself and I'm like h it just
works because I didn't give myself the
option to weasel my way out and it's
like and there she is right like this
this thing that is the most beautiful,
brilliant thing that has so much power

[2:43:47]
brilliant thing that has so much power
and potential, but that's also so
goddamn lazy,
right? And uh that's how I think about
performance as a as a philosophy. Um

[2:44:01]
performance as a as a philosophy. Um
I think what works for me probably won't
work for you. I think some things might
uh but you won't know unless you try to
find out, right? So setting these like
another thing Greg Mchuan said as well

[2:44:15]
another thing Greg Mchuan said as well
was people like New Year's resolution
gets a bad rep but people think should
think about it in the inverse. You
shouldn't set New Year's resolution once
a year. You should do that almost on a
daily basis or like on a you should do
it all the time, right? like you set new

[2:44:32]
it all the time, right? like you set new
goals like just set like you know you
don't want to be this like all over the
place but um with some direction right
like and that's why it's good to know
your purpose because your purpose is

[2:44:46]
your purpose because your purpose is
that northstar like for me it's
leadership and when I then have to make
decisions like oh shiny object over here
would I love to do that absolutely but
does it have to do with leadership and
if not it's a shiny object and I move on

[2:45:01]
if not it's a shiny object and I move on
and say, you know what, like I love what
you do and I appreciate you, but this is
not a part of my core thing and if I do,
I'll be torn away. I'll be taken away
from the thing that really matters to
me. So, um

[2:45:17]
me. So, um
yeah, uh I I think that that is uh
that's the most value that I can provide
someone. It's like, hey, go out there,
try it out, figure it out, see what
works, see what doesn't. Just make sure

[2:45:31]
works, see what doesn't. Just make sure
There's, you know, this saying that's
like before you address yourself with
low self-esteem or depression, make sure
you're not in a room filled with
[ __ ] or like that you're not
surrounding yourself with [ __ ] Like
the same thing goes for your mental
health, right? Before you

[2:45:48]
health, right? Before you
think that something is wrong, you
better try and like get on that diet,
right? Like do like fix yourself. like
try to fix yourself once and if that's
not the thing like do you know do

[2:46:00]
not the thing like do you know do
something else maybe have see a
psychiatrist and maybe like you actually
have a chemical imbalance in your brain
I'm not knocking medicine but as a peel
but the way that it's been made into a
product and given to people um

[2:46:16]
product and given to people um
anti-depressants for example they kill
your microbiome and if you try to get
off it like good luck being happy if you
don't have any serotonin pushed to your
brain
By the way, public service announce
announcement is that diet coke like diet

[2:46:31]
announcement is that diet coke like diet
soda type of thing. It's a it's more
addictive than sugar and sugar is eight
times more addictive than cocaine. So um
and it's also kills your microbiome so
that you're not producing serotonin

[2:46:46]
that you're not producing serotonin
which is the happiness making hormone in
your brain so that you feel clinically
depressed. 90% of serotonin is produced
in your gut. So you know like try those
things first. Uh if you want to get into

[2:47:01]
things first. Uh if you want to get into
performance like whatever performance,
right? Because once your nutrition uh is
adequate,
you're going to feel better. And when
you feel better, you make better
decisions. When you make better
decisions, you can do more of the things

[2:47:17]
decisions, you can do more of the things
that makes you feel good. And it's like
the snowball starts rolling downhill,
right? Instead of you being the guy who
just like uh keeps pushing the the rock
up the hill and then it falls back down

[2:47:30]
up the hill and then it falls back down
again. And I think that's very
desirable. Like that's a good place to
be in when you think about your um
health. And just to tie it up, you said
like a nice little bow. I will tie it up
to in order to actually motivate

[2:47:45]
to in order to actually motivate
yourself.
I do think that there is some cheap
codes here. Number one I would do is
really like maybe it's not number one
but I'll throw it out there anyways like
do that meditation on like what would it
what what is the end of my life look

[2:48:00]
what what is the end of my life look
like and who is there and how are they
reacting to my passing because it does
put that ultimate frame on things and it
creates agency and urgency into what you
do right now. Um, I think that one can

[2:48:15]
do right now. Um, I think that one can
be um a good one to do and it's also
like
showing you if you're if you're aligned
with with what you really want. Um,
I think another thing is like there's
something called 17 questions that
changed my life by Tim Ferrris.

[2:48:31]
changed my life by Tim Ferrris.
um that I think I mean it's not about
like
health and longevity per se, but it's
like a very kind of quirky
funny way and practical way of changing

[2:48:45]
funny way and practical way of changing
the inputs. Uh so so I really recommend
that one. It's on his website. So 17
questions that changed my life. um
and the third thing, no, you know what
the number one thing I would do

[2:49:02]
the number one thing I would do
is ask someone for help,
right? Like just ask someone. People are
so happy to give you help um when you
need it. And if you really like you you
want to do it, like there's going to be
and like there's going to be someone

[2:49:15]
and like there's going to be someone
who's there who's just so happy to help
you and and you just haven't asked them.
So, I think the biggest
thing that you can do is not try to do
it by yourself because you're probably
going to fail and no one is going to
there be there to know and and it's just

[2:49:31]
there be there to know and and it's just
you and um
you're you're the biggest increasing
likelihood is to have someone there to
affirm that that you're doing it and
that will then like cheer you on to to
get it done. Yeah, great advice. One

[2:49:46]
get it done. Yeah, great advice. One
thing I've noticed which annoys me is
how people separates health and
performance. They go this is health,
this is performance and they have like a
different bucket for each and just the
intersection of them both is just like
so apparent when you stop and slow down

[2:50:00]
so apparent when you stop and slow down
that it's like if you want to perform at
a high level you need to be healthy. So
all the conversation around health
generally links to energy it links to
performance and everything we've talked
about today. If you want to perform at
your best at some point you need to be
healthy. Maybe in your 20s you can get
away with it, but longevity to perform

[2:50:16]
away with it, but longevity to perform
for a long period of time, health is
going to be your limiting factor. Some
point you're going to get sick, burn
out, and break down. So yeah, I really
think of nutrition as fuel and building
blocks for the body for to build stuff.
I class exercise as almost like training

[2:50:30]
I class exercise as almost like training
the energy systems so that energy can go
around the body better. I want a strong
heart. I want a strong organs to
actually send liver, sorry, energy
around the body, blood flow, good blood
flow. So you better think about exercise
as a tool to do that. and your health
overall is going to dictate how much

[2:50:45]
overall is going to dictate how much
energy you have to put towards your
goals. So all the stuff we talked about
focus and deep work and being able to uh
pursue your goals at some point energy
is a currency that we need to use to uh
to get us there. So if we haven't got it
in this body that we live you mentioned
nutrition being everything I feel I feel

[2:51:01]
nutrition being everything I feel I feel
very similar as well but I do think
exercise I I link them both very
closely. Uh but yeah I feel like that's
the energy currency of the body that we
need to uh fine-tune if we want to
achieve big things. If you just want to
do mediocre things and cruise through
life, cool. You can you can have

[2:51:15]
life, cool. You can you can have
mediocre health. But over time, it comes
apparent that you need to uh to do work
in these areas. Now, for me, nutrition,
I don't want to go into the rabbit holes
cuz nutrition is almost like religion.
When you open up the the box, people
have got really strong views and they
get really triggered very quickly. For
me, nutrition is almost so easy. It

[2:51:31]
me, nutrition is almost so easy. It
hurts my brain because it's it's not
complicated. It's very simple. You got
to do certain things and avoid certain
things. We all kind of know what they
look like. You can go into the weeds if
you want to, but you do need to be
intentional. I think that's what you
mentioned as well. Like think about what

[2:51:45]
mentioned as well. Like think about what
your end goal is. Why am I making
changes? For me being a performance
coach, I found with poker players,
linking health to their goals helps a
lot. Like them just trying to lose body
fat, get in good shape. They've tried
that their whole life. Doesn't work. But
when you link it to what really matters

[2:52:00]
when you link it to what really matters
to them, they want to be a high
performing poker player and play high
stakes and achieve all their financial
goals. And you can link health to that,
which it does. It's like it's the most
direct link you can see. All of a
sudden, they're like, "Oh, okay, cool. I
didn't realize if I start doing this,
I'm going to be able to perform better."
What I care about, ah, light bulb, now

[2:52:15]
What I care about, ah, light bulb, now
curiosity, now it's engagement. Now,
it's that kind of connection because
it's their goal. You link the the thing
they should be doing, we'll say, uh,
with what they want to be doing or
achieving and all of a sudden they can
stick to that. So, I think that's a a
way I like to piece it together. So
yeah, before we go any deeper into um

[2:52:31]
yeah, before we go any deeper into um
that one, anything anything sparked
there for you, Anton or for you? I know
we're doing a bit more of a conversing
conversation. So anything else that
sparked from that? Yeah, I mean like the
the the only like the really big thing
that sparks is u

[2:52:47]
that sparks is u
how discombobulated our our kind of
systems has been and and how siloed we
are in performance.
So like because it's hard, right? like
we haven't had this
really like welldesigned interconnected

[2:53:02]
really like welldesigned interconnected
way and and the people that have they've
performed tremendously well like the the
story of David Sir David Adam what's his
name Sir David Adamo and the and the
British cycling team like 1% gains type
of thing like this marginal gains kaisen

[2:53:15]
of thing like this marginal gains kaisen
philosophy
um
but the the core thing there is to to
actually have a team and to have those
components like in my business.
I always try to find a way to to think

[2:53:30]
I always try to find a way to to think
about my role and what we do that is not
actually how we do our business because
that can be always like kind of
abstract. It just turns into like
product management terms and titles and
like everyone is running around. We
don't know what we do. So,
uh in my business I see myself as a ex

[2:53:48]
uh in my business I see myself as a ex
Formula 1 driver. like I I'm no longer
like competing at the very very highest
level, but I'm I'm like I'm there,
right? Uh
and maybe I will get back to it, maybe I

[2:54:01]
and maybe I will get back to it, maybe I
won't. But right now, what I'm trying to
do is
um say that I don't want to compete in
an old car. like like I like in order to
compete I need to to have a car and a
stable and like you know what like

[2:54:16]
stable and like you know what like
Formula 1 2025 like you need to have a
nutritionist, you need to have a
trainer, you need to have a
psychologist, you need to have someone
managing stuff for your for your admin,
for your family, right? Like just make
sure that all those things are there so

[2:54:31]
sure that all those things are there so
that your job is no longer like in the
past you used to be the guy who comes
there and tells the mechanic what to do
with the car, right? like you have a guy
with a computer for that.
So,
um I see it as a great opportunity that

[2:54:47]
um I see it as a great opportunity that
we have is like with less resources
connecting more data turning into better
driving better outcomes for our clients
but also
uh not being so siloed as like

[2:55:01]
uh not being so siloed as like
performance coaches and and support
teams so that we can better interact
with one another. and and at the end of
the day solve the client's problem or
the the individual's problem, right?
Like we're solving because my expertise

[2:55:15]
Like we're solving because my expertise
might not cover it, right? Like in the
beginning, your biggest problem might be
that you're stuck with admin, but then
you see that the next problem is that
you have poor emotional regulation, but
like
what we do is not emotional regulation.

[2:55:30]
what we do is not emotional regulation.
like we take care of administrative
stuff but in order to get you to be the
best person like okay so now I get it
like I have to find key partners that
are performance coaches so that I solve
all my clients problems but I can't
build that whole infrastructure it would

[2:55:46]
build that whole infrastructure it would
take a decade right like it takes time
to to build all that myself but now okay
now you start piecing together like
what's missing you build like in in in
business terms as an MVP or you build

[2:56:00]
business terms as an MVP or you build
something You test it and you see if it
solves the client's problem in real like
not the prototype but like in real life
you get feedback and you say what worked
for you what worked for you what worked
for you what didn't work for you and so
on and based on that you build on the

[2:56:16]
on and based on that you build on the
things that work and currently people
are stuck doing that for themselves
right like I try to do it all and what
ends up happening is like nothing really
get the quality that I want because the
biggest cost that I for that is that I

[2:56:31]
biggest cost that I for that is that I
don't get to consolidate. I don't get to
like sit down and take the time to
consolidate like get that feedback loop
for myself and really really learn. Uh
the second cost that I pay is

[2:56:45]
the second cost that I pay is
that I'm not as
I'm getting better with this but I'm not
as present because I'm always thinking
about like the next thing in queue.
there's always like this this next kind
of like cash. Either it's cash like
stuff from the past that I haven't
really like digested yet or there's Q

[2:57:02]
really like digested yet or there's Q
which takes me out of like right here
right now. Um
I made a decision this year that I'm
just going to let the fires burn and I'm
just going to forget that I have a past,
right? Like that stuff is just like

[2:57:15]
right? Like that stuff is just like
something that I can kind of like have
some vague recollections from and then
the future is just like not my priority
right now. And I think that's also a
very pragmatic way of
um

[2:57:30]
engineering your way out of all the
stuff that that you don't need to do. Uh
I guess it's like the the most simple
way I can put that because if we're
going to be honest like I I haven't met
a person yet that's not stuck in in

[2:57:45]
a person yet that's not stuck in in
something that
that they don't need help with.
So uh when we can outsource that which
is very doable once you can see what
your life is like right you can
understand which are my projects which

[2:58:00]
understand which are my projects which
are my areas which are my resources what
are my objectives right like once you
can have that or say like practically
speaking um I want to automate something
that I'm doing recurringly you can't do

[2:58:16]
that I'm doing recurringly you can't do
that unless you know what the flow looks
like we might be able to do that in a
few years time, right? Like that might
just be done for you and it's like the
back end of your phone.
Cool. Like that then it's going to be a
different thing that we're that we're
faced with that we have to solve, but

[2:58:31]
faced with that we have to solve, but
like that's no longer a problem. Uh you
want to create a perfect product that
just you ask and it does it perfect.
Um
so so yeah uh I think that there's
there's a lot of

[2:58:47]
there's a lot of
um
value in in being able to um
step out and always step out one step
back right and look at it and then you
realize like if I look at me like I

[2:59:01]
realize like if I look at me like I
thought I thought I was smart like 3
months ago and then like I look at
myself now and I look at like me and I'm
like ha like and then I take a step back
and I like I know that in three months
from now I'll look at me and I'll be
like haha if I keep putting my one foot

[2:59:16]
like haha if I keep putting my one foot
in front of the other. I can I think
that's such a that's how I know I'm on
the right tracks. And if I don't feel
like that I'm like oh wow like that guy
three months ago he was really something
like that I know I'm I'm kind of
trending in the wrong direction. Yeah.

[2:59:31]
trending in the wrong direction. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah, I think as you were speaking
there, you were talking a lot about the
importance of building a team of people
around you who can almost like
synchronize together to solve problems
and have certain expertise that are all
interacting. And I feel like for a poker
player, most the audience listening,

[2:59:45]
player, most the audience listening,
it's the inverse of how they think. They
think like very solo player game. I've
got to do it all. Me against the world.
Maybe they're chatting with their
buddies. They've got a study partner.
Maybe they've got a coach who's they're
working with like I've got my got my
team, but really like they're doing
everything themselves. Like most most
things themselves. So, I want to make

[3:00:01]
things themselves. So, I want to make
this a practical like lesson for the
audience from your experience. If you
could go back in time, let's say you're
a midstakes player. You're still on the
comeup in poker. How would you start
thinking about team Anton, the team that
you want to create, people around you?

[3:00:15]
you want to create, people around you?
So, we mentioned like having clarity on
the goals you're trying to achieve. But
I think a lot of players will stubbornly
think, "Yeah, I can do it all. Yeah,
I'll just I'll I'll solve my own
problems. I'm a good problem solver.
Just me against the world. Let's go."
So, poor people who are listening, I'm
sure there's a lot of them. Um, how

[3:00:31]
sure there's a lot of them. Um, how
would you start thinking about expanding
that to a bit of a team that like people
who could help you seeking for help in
the areas that they would need it? How
would you problem solve that if
yourself? I would uh
I would make sure to to think about one

[3:00:47]
I would make sure to to think about one
thing
like what's one thing that I can do to
take action and I'll start there like
just just one thing like it like the the
lower the barrier of you like doing it

[3:01:01]
lower the barrier of you like doing it
the better. Just make sure that like you
put some like you send a message to my
friend like hey if I don't if I don't do
this one thing and I let you know by 7
PM like
this happens like something something

[3:01:16]
this happens like something something
bad like you you just get to ridicule me
or whatever is like the the thing that
you wouldn't like for your friend to do
uh like some kind of punishment like not
too much but like something that you
wouldn't enjoy
and then you just like do that and see

[3:01:30]
and then you just like do that and see
what happens.
That's the most practical advice I can
give because anything else is just a
story.
That's like a story and stories are nice
when they're told
from what happened in the past. But like

[3:01:46]
from what happened in the past. But like
what you're looking to do is
do something in the in right now and
anything else is kind of an illusion.
So, like that's the point I was trying
to make with like the past is a story

[3:02:00]
to make with like the past is a story
and that we remember one way or another.
It's it's not that accurate and the
future hasn't manifested yet. It's not
there. Like you can be sure that reality
will be there to catch you. Like either
if you fall or if you run or if you sit,
it's still going to be there for you. Um

[3:02:18]
it's still going to be there for you. Um
but what you can change is the next
thing you do.
And if you don't do it,
I I like this analogy. Uh there was

[3:02:31]
I I like this analogy. Uh there was
someone who said
when people say I'm too busy,
I say tell them that this is Sack Bush
actually, Sack Bush MB. He said that
when someone tells me that I'm that

[3:02:46]
when someone tells me that I'm that
they're too busy, I usually tell what I
tell them back is that if the creation
of the universe depended on you, then
nothing would have happened, would it?
And I like that.

[3:03:00]
And I like that.
So if that doesn't motivate you, if you
don't feel like like that's that's the
thing, like go for it, you know, like
teach your own. Like I I don't judge
anyone for for how they choose to live
their lives. Um I miss saying that I

[3:03:16]
their lives. Um I miss saying that I
think one way is
more painful than the other for me. And
and that's kind of like where I make my
choice and that I choose to to finish
off uh
with something I think like in in the in

[3:03:32]
with something I think like in in the in
this realm. It's a it's a quote from Tim
Ferrris. Um and he's it's like my
favorite quote. But I lived by it all
year last year and I'll continue to live
by it. It says reality is largely

[3:03:45]
by it. It says reality is largely
negotiable
and it's like it's so elegant.
It's such a
beautiful way of giving you the power
and the permission to get out there, you

[3:04:00]
and the permission to get out there, you
know, get out there and and do something
about it. Um, and if you don't, that's
cool. Just make sure that you that you
know that you don't that's not that's
what you want or that's not what you
don't want. Yeah.

[3:04:15]
don't want. Yeah.
Yeah. Very very powerful. And I think it
makes me relay on the importance of
stories. And we're living our life
through a story narrative. And even like
every time you tell a story, it's always
the past. If I tell you about this
conversation, it's the past. If I tell
you what I'm doing now, I'm always a

[3:04:31]
you what I'm doing now, I'm always a
thought behind. I'm always a moment
behind. I can never tell a story about
the moments. And I think one of the big
parts of personal growth for all of us
is understanding the stories we're
telling ourselves. I can think of when I
whenever I have a client who I work with
lots and I know he can take the kind of

[3:04:45]
lots and I know he can take the kind of
more harsh feedback. He'll tell me his
biggest problems and he just unloads all
his problems and I'll just say nice
story. He's no it's not a story it's a
it's happened. This is real. This is and
he'll start protecting it and I'm like
it's a good story. What what are you
missing? And then he's like the defense
mechanism obvious need to know the

[3:05:00]
mechanism obvious need to know the
client well to uh be that direct but it
shows that it's all just a story and
we're all just telling them. So if we if
we get caught up in the story and it
feels like reality like Tim Fer said
reality is negotiable. Why? Because
reality is largely the story we're
telling about it. Okay cool. Now why
what can I drop? And if you can just

[3:05:16]
what can I drop? And if you can just
drop the story that's limiting you. It's
often the unlock that we need. That
gives you permission to just go back in
the moments. You mentioned as well like
kind of be more present. That's also my
2025 goal is being more present. I did a
10-day silent retreat recently and the

[3:05:30]
10-day silent retreat recently and the
whole thing was trying to be present in
the moment and watch thoughts. And it's
realized to me how much the purpose the
primary goal is often just to be in the
moment doing what you're doing. The
secondary purpose is to uh live your
chase your goals, be your character, do
what you want to do. But the main goal

[3:05:45]
what you want to do. But the main goal
is like can you be in the moment? Are
you here? No, you're not. Okay, cool.
You lost that moment where can you get
back to it and trying to return to it.
So yeah, for you, what are some of the
most powerful stories you've had to let
go of? So if you think of your like
transition through life, you've
obviously been a successful poker

[3:06:00]
obviously been a successful poker
player, transition to business, like
these jumps often rely on you having to
let go of some stories that might have
been true or powerful for you at some
point. Any any come to mind that you've
had to negotiate or let go of?
Feeling sorry for myself.

[3:06:18]
That's that's like the biggest thing
in life. Things will always go wrong,

[3:06:30]
in life. Things will always go wrong,
right? Like there there's always going
to be [ __ ] happens and and then you have
to deal with it.
And
your choice is to either
deal with it head on and and acknowledge

[3:06:45]
deal with it head on and and acknowledge
the like separate reality of fact from
reality of how I feel.
And I think that's something that I
really struggled with because I
identified a lot with
the idea that I had of who I used to be,

[3:07:03]
the idea that I had of who I used to be,
right? like it's not who I used to be.
It's the idea of that. Like that's that
that was how I defined my character and
my personality.
Whereas in
physical reality where we are right now,

[3:07:17]
physical reality where we are right now,
I'm just writing like the literal next
sentence. Like that's all I'm doing. All
that other stuff is just gone. So giving
myself that permission to to let go of
that starts with not victimizing myself,

[3:07:32]
that starts with not victimizing myself,
right? like not feeling this sadness
over the mistakes that I've done in the
past and keep kind of like dragging
those along in my big backpack of of
things that I've actually learned,

[3:07:45]
things that I've actually learned,
right? Like so I wanted to mention this
before, but I think like a really
helpful thing is to think about things
in frames and how you can reframe
something. And we can like we could go
on and have a whole workshop on like
here's my frame right now and like could

[3:08:00]
here's my frame right now and like could
you improve this frame and the answer is
always going to be yes. But then at some
point like you don't want to keep
refining the frame unless you want to
become a chess grandmaster, right? Like
that that would be one where you would
have to get to like the ultimate frame
to be able to beat the other guy. And

[3:08:16]
to be able to beat the other guy. And
that's a noble pursuit in itself. Um
that's epic actually. But
for you know the m average mid-state
grinders that that are listening to this
and want to start your journey think
about the frames and how you're

[3:08:31]
about the frames and how you're
responsible for those and how could you
reframe like oh my god I have to go to
the gym it's so hard and it's painful to
like
you know what new day better me I know

[3:08:48]
you know what new day better me I know
that in a month from now I'll thank
myself. I know it's going to be painful.
I know it's going to suck, but I want
something better for myself. And if it's
too if it's going to if I'm going to be

[3:09:00]
too if it's going to if I'm going to be
in like physical pain and it's going to
hurt, I'm just going to say like stop.
Like, okay, like today is not the day.
I'll just like go home, drink some
water, stretch, do whatever, and I'll do
it again tomorrow or I'll try something
else, right? Like just try some stuff

[3:09:15]
else, right? Like just try some stuff
until it sticks. And um
once it does, you're going to know it
because you're going to feel it, right?
It feels good. That's like, oh, I like
that. Oh, that that's good. Like that
that's that's that thing. And then
double down on that. And then the stuff

[3:09:30]
double down on that. And then the stuff
that you don't really like.
Don't try to,
you know, be the guy who's trying to put
a triangle into a queue. like it's it's
like it looks pretty silly, you know,
when you see someone who's like trying
to like fit like the wrong thing in the

[3:09:46]
to like fit like the wrong thing in the
wrong thing. Um
so, so yeah, just like giving yourself
permission to reinvent yourself in in
the present moment and not feel bad
about it and not tell everyone how like

[3:10:00]
about it and not tell everyone how like
poor me for for going through this thing
and like nobody cares. Like come on.
Nobody cares about your bad beat. Nobody
cares about like all that stuff. They
just care about you. Maybe if you're
lucky, right? Like if you're lucky, they

[3:10:16]
lucky, right? Like if you're lucky, they
care about how you feel. And that's
something you can talk about because
that's real. That's like what you have
right now. Uh so I think like
the the like really big theme is to to
normalize that and to let people like be

[3:10:31]
normalize that and to let people like be
who they are. um
and have a little bit of patience. Um
you know like why
not always jump to solutions actually
uh because it's a very I think we're all

[3:10:47]
uh because it's a very I think we're all
pretty good at that and uh if we can
give oursel a little bit more time and
space to just not do anything about it
like you'll be surprised what really
happens and and like when you have the
time to

[3:11:01]
time to
Mhm.
The answer appears
most often or the problem you thought
was a problem was never a problem to
begin with. Yeah, I think that's often

[3:11:15]
begin with. Yeah, I think that's often
what I noticed as well. And as you
saying there as well, I think about
frames and the challenge with the frames
we have and kind of changing them. I
think a lot of people one don't have the
awareness of their frames. So they have
a problem. keep clashing with that
problem over and over, not realizing

[3:11:31]
problem over and over, not realizing
it's a the way they're viewing the
situation that's causing the problems.
That's the first step. Second, they
don't give themselves permission to
change the frame. They have an identity
attached to this is how I am. Even like
people who have the identity, I'm
unlucky. They like the bad beat stories.
They a lot tied up like I'm an unlucky

[3:11:46]
They a lot tied up like I'm an unlucky
guy. It's like no, let's let's drop
that. Let's if you weren't the lucky
guy. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Now I've got to
I've got to open up a doorway that I
could be making mistakes. But I think
permission to drop your frames and then
the ability to reframe or add frames.
And the way I like to see it is almost

[3:12:00]
And the way I like to see it is almost
like adding perspectives like different
lens to look through. Any situation can
be looked through from lots of different
lens. And the more lens you have of a
situation, the more accurate it is. And
very often when you go deeper and deeper
into like acquiring more ways of looking
at stuff, you almost always arrive at

[3:12:15]
at stuff, you almost always arrive at
nothing really matters. It's all
impermanent anyway. and you're like,
"Oh, it's kind of it's kind of a freeing
place because you're like," then all the
problems you're fighting with just
disintegrate. So, yeah, I play around
with this almost daily with like what
frames I am currently looking at life
through. Which ones have utility? It's

[3:12:30]
through. Which ones have utility? It's
like, "Oh, this frame's good. This is
helping me towards my goals and when I
get stuck or I feel resistance or I feel
something internally, I'm like, what
frame have I got today? Okay, cool.
Let's have a look at this. How can I
dissect this? What can I add to it?
Where can I reframe this this lens? Can
I add a larger horizon? Like time frame.

[3:12:46]
I add a larger horizon? Like time frame.
For me, sometimes the frame I'm looking
for is just a time frame. It's like I
want to get somewhere now. So, I'm
feeling resistance because I want to get
to a destination which might take me 5
months and I want to get to here today.
Okay, cool. Now, we need the framing's
wrong. I I want to get here now. The
frame is actually needs to expand to

[3:13:01]
frame is actually needs to expand to
give myself more time. See, I think
there's, as you said, we could do a
workshop, a seminar, a full three more
hours on that that topic. So, I don't
want to dive in too much. I actually
want to pass to Ren because I'm curious
to know any stories you've had on this
topic in terms of stories that you've

[3:13:15]
topic in terms of stories that you've
had to uh let go of in your career or
stories that you felt like were part of
your identity that you had a hard time
letting go of. Yeah, for sure. I mean,
the biggest story that I had to let go
of was basically due to the traditional
education system. I didn't go to the to

[3:13:30]
education system. I didn't go to the to
the Waldorf school, unfortunately. Uh
but you know how how it's how it's done,
right? you're being you're being graded
and I was always graded like dumb for
the normal education system, right? I
now know that I have certain talents

[3:13:45]
now know that I have certain talents
that the system didn't really man
measure, but according to the system, I
was pretty dumb, right? And I was always
in school, every class, they would put
me separate. I had a separate desk next
to the teacher. That's kind of how bad
it was. So, I was kind of always primed
that I even had the story. I don't know

[3:14:01]
that I even had the story. I don't know
if I actually hurt someone once said
that but like ah if Renee doesn't end up
on the street you know doing drugs you
know it's a good outcome that's kind of
how bad it was right so I kind of had
the story around very a fixed mindset
right I had kind of this story around

[3:14:15]
right I had kind of this story around
okay well your knowledge is fixed you
know I'm labeled as not good at really
anything uh and that story actually got
really challenged in poker right I had
to kind of break through that story like
like I said earlier when I was at this
at this really rock bottom m [ __ ] I have

[3:14:31]
at this really rock bottom m [ __ ] I have
I I got the story broke when I learned
about oh wait I can actually grow. I
have control over this [ __ ] Oh well no
no no one ever told me that right? And
then actually the story um even when at
some point when I was at the peak of my
career it was still a story that was

[3:14:46]
career it was still a story that was
there was like internal conflict like
wait I have these results consistently
over many years but this is still that
story that's running in the background
that's saying like hey this this cannot
this cannot be true right because all
these result it's just a matter of time

[3:15:00]
these result it's just a matter of time
before this is all going to go away
because you know you're not supposed to
be good at anything. So that was a story
that was really I would say yeah that
that was a story that made me not be
able to
enjoy the peak of my career as much

[3:15:16]
enjoy the peak of my career as much
because I was way more afraid that
reality which was linked to the story
would come around the corner right um so
that was a very big story that I had to
to drop and actually recently since I
had my daughter I started to tell tell

[3:15:33]
had my daughter I started to tell tell
stories around yeah I have a daughter
now or my dad now. And instead of seeing
that as I caught myself instead of
seeing that with all the the nice things
that comes with it, I started to reframe
it more as like a lot of doors closing.

[3:15:46]
it more as like a lot of doors closing.
Again, it's like perspective, right? You
can see it as a lot of doors opening,
but I started to see it as a lot of
doors closing. Now, this probably also
had something to do with the fact, you
know, that I was a bit sleepd deprived
that, you know, my habits weren't
weren't that great. So, you get into

[3:16:00]
weren't that great. So, you get into
like a negative spiral, right? That
didn't help. I remember at some point
actually my my my wife said, "Okay, I'm
going to force you now. Every morning
7:00 you're here on the beach playing
playing Foodfolly." Uh, and surprise
surprise, I feel I feel I feel much
better. The stories the stories are not

[3:16:15]
better. The stories the stories are not
so dark anymore. Uh, so it's definitely
linked as well. And in general all the
conversations that you guys had I can if
I look back in my own career I can check
all the boxes from you know changing my
perspectives from building in reframes
that I thought you know would be better

[3:16:30]
that I thought you know would be better
for my performance from creating these
non-negotiables right just like you said
with drink I just stopped alcohol
completely because I noticed if if I
kept the door open my friend said oh
yeah you're not going to drink tonight
well try one whereas if I just said I
don't drink there's no negotiable so I

[3:16:45]
don't drink there's no negotiable so I
don't drink right it's way easier to
keep keep your standards or like before
playing day I don't eat any dirty stuff
or if I'm going to play next day I don't
don't eat any dirty stuff I keep a clean
diet it's very simple non-negotiable
right when you when you try to keep the
door open uh [ __ ] goes wrong so yeah I

[3:17:02]
door open uh [ __ ] goes wrong so yeah I
can I can very strongly uh relate with
everything you guys uh yeah you guys
were saying
yeah

[3:17:15]
yeah it's it's funny how we get in our
own way, right? like how how easy it is
for us to
play someone else's game like someone
told me this so therefore I believe that

[3:17:31]
told me this so therefore I believe that
this is who I am type of thing and I
think that's something to be very
um
vigilant about uh in order to to just
like

[3:17:45]
yeah play play like I think also like
since we're here on on a podcast about
playing games, right? Like I think like
one of the things that actually came up
when when we all talked is that we have
this tendency to when we talk about
serious questions to get very serious,

[3:18:02]
serious questions to get very serious,
right? Like like like
it's always like this problem that needs
to be solved that gives you these like
wrinkles between your eyes. And I mean
Renee, you you have a kid. I don't know
about you, Adam, but like

[3:18:18]
the experience of watching like being
with kids and being near and around kids
is like especially like really young
kids like they don't have a story yet,
right? Like they haven't made like made

[3:18:31]
right? Like they haven't made like made
anything up. And I mean like my my
deepest curiosity, the thing that I will
be always forever most curious about is
what it's like to be a newborn. like
like because I I I remember my first
memory but I don't remember like before

[3:18:47]
memory but I don't remember like before
that because I didn't have a way to kind
of maybe one day I will know you know
but that kind of deep rooted curiosity I
think is it holds a lot of answers and
if we're able to kind of like tap into

[3:19:03]
if we're able to kind of like tap into
that it's somehow
I have this felt sense that that would
be like ultimate freedom in a way.
you know, like there are no rules there.
There is no constructs, there's no

[3:19:16]
There is no constructs, there's no
there's no nothing. Um,
and I think that's kind of a way, right?
Like it could be a way to warp reality
and then back to present moment where
it's like
when I start telling myself that story,

[3:19:30]
when I start telling myself that story,
can I laugh about myself? It's a it's a
really good framing question. like can I
see my problem like the guys you coach
and like what you talked about Adam when
they come in and they're like oh my god
like this thing and like are you able to
laugh about it and they're like no I'm

[3:19:46]
laugh about it and they're like no I'm
like okay like then you're in then
you're in story mode
now when you can like tell the story
about how funny it was and like all that
stuff that you went through all your

[3:20:00]
stuff that you went through all your
troubles and hardships and you can do
that in like a way where you get make
other people including yourself will
pull you to laugh then it's like you're
in narrator mode
and and I think that's like u um yeah

[3:20:15]
and and I think that's like u um yeah
like a really cool thing because because
with performance I feel like the biggest
trap of that is to to to like lose sight
of our child childishness like our
playfulness and treat it like the game

[3:20:31]
playfulness and treat it like the game
that has to be won and it's like But
then we didn't really go back and define
the rules of the game, right? Like like
I'm I'm misplaying by some arbitrary
like again like why I dislike this like
here's I'm so and so and here is my

[3:20:45]
here's I'm so and so and here is my
blueprint and I'm like based on what
data and like is this coming with a
caveat that not for everyone by the way?
You know yeah your definition of
Yeah. or or like doesn't have to be when

[3:21:01]
Yeah. or or like doesn't have to be when
like for me one of my biggest
philosophical questions is value, right?
Like what is valuable to you is clearly
valuable to you. It's like it could be
your biggest treasure, your biggest
price, the thing that is so close and

[3:21:15]
price, the thing that is so close and
dear to your heart. And for me, I'm
like, yeah, I don't care about that.
Like don't get me wrong, you know, like
I'm excited for you being excited about
something and I think that's amazing and
I think that creates a lot of value, but

[3:21:30]
I think that creates a lot of value, but
it's not valuable to me or or the next
person. Uh but like but it deres value
once you start connecting it and seeing
that it actually does, right? Like it's
just it's just that I'm on my own path
to to create it. And if we can come

[3:21:45]
to to create it. And if we can come
together and kind of play around that, I
think that's something that's incredibly
powerful because then you start getting
a new perspective, right? Like it's not
that I didn't care about your thing. So
yeah, like just reframing like it's not
that I didn't care about your thing. I

[3:22:00]
that I didn't care about your thing. I
just didn't understand it. I didn't see
why you thought it was valuable. And
once I started getting that, I the
quickest way to get there is to play
from from my experience. And it's fun,
right? Like we all like to play games
one way or another. So

[3:22:17]
one way or another. So
maybe like going back to the starting a
study group, that can also be a really
good way of saying what could be the
most playful way I could do this, right?
Like how could I create an environment
where I know that I'm going to have fun?
How can I find a bunch of other nerds

[3:22:30]
How can I find a bunch of other nerds
that are nerds into the same thing that
I am nerdy about and like we can have
our amazing party where we talk about
the stuff that we love to do. Like that
to me is culture,
right? Like we see culture as this like

[3:22:47]
right? Like we see culture as this like
pedestal like thing because you always
see it and like yeah the Chicago Bulls
had this amazing like team culture and
like yeah all those things are true but
like at the end of the day
they were relentless performers but did

[3:23:03]
they were relentless performers but did
they have fun along that road and had
people keep showing up? Yes. And then
they also had Michael Jordan who
probably kicked everyone's ass if they
didn't play ball, you know. Um, but

[3:23:15]
didn't play ball, you know. Um, but
again, I like just
what are the components of the whole
instead of the details because that's
that's kind of like where we um
where we forget and it's easier to

[3:23:30]
where we forget and it's easier to
forget if it's just you or it's easier
to make excuses if it's just you as well
because there's no one there to see it,
right? But your subconscious will be
like well about that.
Yeah. Yeah. And I feel like also there
needs to be some level of enjoyment,
right? Like if if we are do on paper

[3:23:47]
right? Like if if we are do on paper
exactly okay, I have to do this this
this this this. But if it's just simply
not fun, you will probably give up in a
week, right? So yeah, we have to create
a culture where uh where we indeed
obviously feel the necessity to do

[3:24:00]
obviously feel the necessity to do
things, right? It's like we don't have
to think about it because well, this is
our goal and this is clearly attached to
our goal. That's one thing. Uh, but
yeah, we shouldn't really, for example,
if I think about everything that I did
for my poker career, like there was
nothing that I really hated doing, you

[3:24:15]
nothing that I really hated doing, you
know, it was kind of kind of a
no-brainer. So, I don't know if like,
for example, if exercise or diet, you
know, I didn't really think about it.
There's no there's no resistance. But
maybe some people have extreme
resistance to that and then it becomes
way harder for them, right? So, they can
they should probably not take it to they

[3:24:31]
they should probably not take it to they
should just stick to the minimum, right?
just go walk around your building, I
don't know, instead of actually going to
the gym, right? But at least if you walk
around your building consistently every
day, that's better than, you know,
trying to push to the gym and then
giving up for a month, right? Um, so

[3:24:47]
giving up for a month, right? Um, so
yeah. All right. I want to do uh some
reflection on your very long career in
poker. I think it's already what 17
years actually. It's very similar to
mine. We are both I think you labeled
yourself as a dinosaur in the
testimonial. I'm a fellow dinosaur. Uh

[3:25:01]
testimonial. I'm a fellow dinosaur. Uh
17 years in poker. Long time. What would
you say is the most important lesson
that uh poker has taught you? Yeah, I
think the one thing would be that unless
you get out there, you're not going to

[3:25:16]
you get out there, you're not going to
find out.
Like the more you put yourself out there
and and like do things,
it's the only way to elevate.
There is no shortcut. You just have to

[3:25:30]
There is no shortcut. You just have to
do it.
And all the time that you spend not
doing it is just that.
So,
you know, we we're all we're all scared
of stuff
u at least like the majority of us. And

[3:25:48]
u at least like the majority of us. And
uh
the sooner you can the sooner I got out
there and the sooner I
know
want to fight the next boss or slay the

[3:26:01]
want to fight the next boss or slay the
next dragon or um
ask that pretty girl uh if she likes me
like this sooner I got the answer and if
the answer is no or

[3:26:15]
the answer is no or
whatever then it's just like Maybe ask
why.
Most people will give you the time of
day, and if they don't, they're probably
a jerk anyways, and you don't want their
advice, so it's fine. Um,
and
then then

[3:26:31]
then then
you'll know.
So, you're speaking of being courageous
because everyone everyone is afraid,
right? Like fear, but some people don't
let fear stop them. And I think it's
usually the courage to still go for it

[3:26:45]
usually the courage to still go for it
despite of the fact that failing is an
option, right? I mean, we're poker
players. Play the game.
Show up and play the game. Check race.
Yeah. No risk, no reward. Uh, speaking

[3:27:01]
Yeah. No risk, no reward. Uh, speaking
of that, actually, I saw I saw in the in
the question there, you can you can ask
we give you some things to fill out. You
said that you're a gambler at heart. You
also I think filled out you prefer yolo.
Uh those in line these did did these

[3:27:16]
Uh those in line these did did these
things ever get you in trouble? Uh did
you ever go broke or what would you
describe as like your biggest rock
bottom moment in poker
due to this attributes? Maybe have this
attributes ever gotten you in trouble?

[3:27:32]
There's this song is like so good at
being in trouble.
That's you, you know. Yeah. It it it's a
it hits a certain note at least, right?
Like I don't identify as as one or the

[3:27:47]
Like I don't identify as as one or the
other when I ask those questions. Like I
think they're good thoughtprovoking
questions because it's kind of like,
you know, I'm this, I'm that, a little
bit of both. Um, but what I appreciate

[3:28:00]
bit of both. Um, but what I appreciate
about myself and and what I a character
trait that I really like about myself is
that I go for it, which means that I
I will be more on the gambly side
because I want to maximize my upside.
That's how I look at that. I'm like, I
want to do

[3:28:16]
want to do
there's this like Jeff Basos super
famous letter for his shareholders where
he's like as an entrepreneur what
like he makes the analogy of that being
baseball and he says that sometimes you
hit a home run, right? But the only

[3:28:32]
hit a home run, right? But the only
difference between baseball and
entrepreneurship is when you hit a home
run, you can hit a thousand rounds,
right? like the the return is so
outsized on the other side then you know

[3:28:46]
outsized on the other side then you know
I'm talking about that in business but
that's life
if you really like go for that you're
going to strike out a lot of times but
again like you really get to find out
and when you connect with the ball in

[3:29:00]
and when you connect with the ball in
any sport like that feeling or that
sound that you hear it's like
you can be in an arena and a whole arena
just stops. You just hear like bing
and it's like you could hear a needle

[3:29:15]
and it's like you could hear a needle
drop.
Everything just goes completely still
and then it's like and to see that thing
get straight out of the park.
So uh so yeah that

[3:29:32]
So uh so yeah that
from that perspective have like has
obviously when you when you when you see
a good opportunity you want to go for
it. Uh, did that ever get you in in in
trouble? Obviously, when you swing, you
know, you you will often miss. Sometimes

[3:29:46]
know, you you will often miss. Sometimes
you hit the home run, right? But often
you missed. Does any any any big miss
come to mind? Yeah. But that's that's
where the that's kind of where the the
yolo aspect comes in, right? Like like I
I just want to ping those two things off

[3:30:00]
I just want to ping those two things off
one another. So like I see Mike's
business partner, he had this quote on
his WhatsApp, Martin. It says, "Don't
quit cuz yolo."

[3:30:15]
And then then there's a guy doing a
cartwheel, right? Um so
if you don't get yourself into trouble
every now and then, you're probably not
playing loose enough, right? Like you're
probably just like playing safe and
sticking to a strategy that you know. Um

[3:30:31]
sticking to a strategy that you know. Um
and that means that you won't get any
other feedback. Um,
but like I can think of a million
situations that I've been in that would
be considered

[3:30:45]
be considered
um like dangerous. Like right now I'm in
Mexico. I lost my passport. I've been
living out of my suitcase for the past
10 months. Um,
I'm putting all my resources into my

[3:31:01]
I'm putting all my resources into my
into my company. uh like all those
things are risks that I that I take but
I'm doing that for for outsiz returns
not just in terms of my business and in
life but in terms of outsiz returns in

[3:31:15]
life but in terms of outsiz returns in
terms of how
um
much enjoyment I can squeeze out of it
right like I could go around and be
scared all day about the situation I
could get into or I can be prepared

[3:31:31]
could get into or I can be prepared
prepared to deal with it when it arises.
And like my
my odds at surviving a situation that
would be bad being character number one
in this game or character number two is

[3:31:47]
in this game or character number two is
like
scare people get rob,
you know, like people that are that are
like there, they're like a target
because someone is like, "Oh yeah, like
this guy won't put up a fight." Um,

[3:32:00]
this guy won't put up a fight." Um,
so, so I think it's more about
just watching out like watch out for
people that are scared. Like watch out
for like bad people that are scared and
watch out for psychopaths out there that

[3:32:15]
watch out for psychopaths out there that
that are just like bad people. Like I've
seen it in my life. I've seen some bad
people where I'm like I'm glad I'm not
in a nonSafe space with you because I
know you're a bad man kind of thing.
Um, and I've seen some people that have

[3:32:31]
Um, and I've seen some people that have
been scared that I'm like, I mean, I was
in the stampede in Vegas when that
happened. And I saw some people where
I'm like, my only recourse was to look
at them in such a way that they would be
more scared of me than they were about

[3:32:46]
more scared of me than they were about
this imaginary threat of some gunman in
order for them to like direct their
attention elsewhere type of thing. Um,
so, so yeah, I you know, um, I don't

[3:33:03]
so, so yeah, I you know, um, I don't
know how
I'm I'm just trying to think of one time
that I', I've like really gotten into
trouble, but but I don't think I've ever
got into trouble for that really. Like I

[3:33:16]
got into trouble for that really. Like I
think my the times that I got into
trouble was when I was um unaware.
the the times that I really get into
trouble is when I'm um

[3:33:31]
like I have this the only superstition I
have is leaving keys at the table and I
think it's a very rational superstition
to have is like unlucky
and I think it is because it signals
that you're about to leave. So like I

[3:33:46]
that you're about to leave. So like I
think the biggest indicator for me like
when things have gone wrong is because
I'm stressed. Like when I experience
stress that leads to really bad
decisions and a stressed me will get
myself into some trouble because I'm not

[3:34:00]
myself into some trouble because I'm not
thinking like I'm I'm not actually like
like there. Um, so yeah, I I would say
like that being a better lead and uh,
yeah, it's like stress has made me miss

[3:34:15]
yeah, it's like stress has made me miss
opportunity. Stress has lost me money.
Stress has put me in more stress.
It put me in situations that I also have
been in that I I have my back against
the wall and I have to figure out a way
to to get out of it and then I do,

[3:34:30]
to to get out of it and then I do,
right? because at the end of the day,
like put my back against the wall, I
will fight. I I like life very much too
much to to just like give up. Um
but

[3:34:45]
yeah, I think like, you know, I think
that's the part of it. And and I think
like the biggest cost of that has been
um

[3:35:02]
relationships.
The the relationships has been the
biggest cost of like not being able to
to show up. Uh that's been the biggest
price. I mean, luckily I haven't really
gotten

[3:35:16]
gotten
Yeah. You know what? Actually,
I have one. We uh me and a couple of
friends we we went to the mountains in
um Sequoia National Park

[3:35:32]
um Sequoia National Park
and we went for a lovely track
uh which was a very moderate easy kind
of kind of track. Um
we we may or may not have gone off the

[3:35:46]
we we may or may not have gone off the
trail so to speak. Uh and we we ended up
in this beautiful place called Marble
Falls. And we decided, you know what?
Like, this this shouldn't be the end of
the the trip. Like, we're going to we're
going to take this little road and we

[3:36:00]
going to take this little road and we
can go in through the waterfall and come
up the backside. And we decided to go
like off the trail.
And
I saw a guy. It's like we're very much
out there, but I see some guy trail
running. And I'm like, okay, we can just

[3:36:15]
running. And I'm like, okay, we can just
like go up this path and we can double
back the way that he came.
So we walk like we walk up this hill
maybe like 30 40 m elevator where he
was. So we go up this track and it looks
nice and safe and easy and there's like

[3:36:31]
nice and safe and easy and there's like
a dry mudslide
after like 20 m. So we're now at like a
10 m plateau
and there's no way out like we cannot go
down and the only way out is up.

[3:36:49]
And the there's a long story, right?
Like it involves like a lot of really
after the fact funny details.
Uh the short story is there was no

[3:37:00]
Uh the short story is there was no
Instagram for a few hours. Um
I've never been so scared in my life.
Like true fear. like the the the sense
of this fear was like a big black bird
hovering over me and just saying if you

[3:37:15]
hovering over me and just saying if you
slip if you make one mistake
you're going to be toast. It's over and
like you'll slip down this hill and and
that's it. Uh so I think like
the place that you really don't want to

[3:37:30]
the place that you really don't want to
make mistakes is is being in
environments that are not forgiving.
Hey, nature.
Nature is beautiful, but she is also
uh very indifferent to you.

[3:37:50]
What is your definition of success and
how is this uh evolved over the years?
I like to use the alam what's uh what's

[3:38:02]
I like to use the alam what's uh what's
the meaning and purpose of life? Uh I
really like his definition and I think
it like what he said was to live your
life
and to me that's the definition of

[3:38:15]
and to me that's the definition of
success.
Um to really fully live your life and
and feel like that's enough. If you do
that, you'll be the richest person in
the world. Um yeah. Yeah. So that's

[3:38:30]
the world. Um yeah. Yeah. So that's
that's also I guess how I see value.
How has that shaped how you live your
life?
I become a very relentless person.
I'm very relentless.

[3:38:46]
I'm very relentless.
um I'm not very often satisfied
in in the sense that
I always want more and

[3:39:01]
I always want more and
that's something that is um that I have
to reconcile with. Um it's the also the
thing I love most about myself and um

[3:39:15]
thing I love most about myself and um
it feels so gratifying when I when I hit
my own standard like when I when I like
eclipse my own benchmark on something
like doesn't matter what it is right
like this could be something that
someone else could do with one hand tied

[3:39:30]
someone else could do with one hand tied
behind their back but it's just that
feeling of myself
having exceeded my own expectation.
Um,
you can't pay me enough money to

[3:39:46]
you can't pay me enough money to
to feel feel that feeling. There's
nothing
um else that's more rewarding. That's
the biggest price. And that's mine.
That's only mine.
Adam, for you,

[3:40:01]
Adam, for you,
how do you how do you live your life?
Yeah. So, I think the definition of
success was good, the Alan Watts one.
And I like Alan Watts's other definition
of life, so to speak, where he talks
about it being a game. It's all just a
game, and you just got to play the game

[3:40:16]
game, and you just got to play the game
to the to the most fun you can have with
the game that you're playing and
realizing it's not serious. I really
like that analogy. Part of me when I
think success does kind of think about
growth, some sort of purpose, some sort

[3:40:30]
growth, some sort of purpose, some sort
of living a meaningful life to that it's
meaningful to you. So I think this links
back to like knowing your values,
knowing like who you are and trying to
align your behaviors with with that. But
on some level, it's just like just just
living your life is kind of what it's
all about and being present because none

[3:40:46]
all about and being present because none
of that external stuff really matters.
If we think of success, I had a friend
who recently asked me about oh successes
I've had and I was like none of the
things I could quote as a success really
felt like a success. like anything I
could say would on the surface maybe
seem like a success but it wasn't really

[3:41:01]
seem like a success but it wasn't really
and the most success I felt is like
living in the moment like being in a
moment like feeling that feeling that
Anton said those are the times and yeah
often that can be a growth opportunity
when you've pushed to a new level or
exceed expectations or it could be just

[3:41:15]
exceed expectations or it could be just
just present with a friend just in a
moment having a conversation you're like
ah this is life I don't need to validate
myself I don't need to achieve something
I don't need to earn this success I'm
winning the game of life because I'm
here By default, I win. Amazing. So,
it's I think that's where I sometimes

[3:41:30]
it's I think that's where I sometimes
have like a a paradox going on my head
of success, like what is what is it
really kind of playing back and forth,
but yeah, I think over time it's getting
more towards being in the moment and
less towards trying to get to an outcome
of success. All right, we've had a very
Yeah, it's not necessarily the the

[3:41:45]
Yeah, it's not necessarily the the
experience itself, but it's how you how
you experience the experience, right,
that kind of determines the the success.
Exactly. And when you think about that,
how do you experience something fully?
It's being in the moment, right? It's
being present with it. And when you're

[3:42:00]
being present with it. And when you're
with it, it's like the the moment feels
good. Even washing the dishes, if you're
present with it, water feels nice on the
hands. Oh, it bubbles. Nice. So, it's
like just that being with the moment
that you're in. So, yeah. Again, we
could go into another Yeah. It's not
what, it's how. It's how it's not it's
not it's not what you achieve, but it's

[3:42:15]
not it's not what you achieve, but it's
how how you felt in in the journey and
when you achieved it, like the emotions
around it. Yes. And I think for me a lot
of the reason I would class things as
success in the past was because I create
a story narrative that I had to do XY Z
to feel success. It's like it's a unlock

[3:42:31]
to feel success. It's like it's a unlock
button. When I do all these things, I
unlock success and I allow myself to
feel happy. And it's like, oh well the
cheat code would be remove all those
steps and allow myself to feel good now.
Okay. Interesting. Okay. Now, oh now I'm
winning. This is cheating. It's kind of
cheating because now I don't need to

[3:42:45]
cheating because now I don't need to
give myself permission to experience
something. So I I realized for myself I'
I'd locked success kind of a door and I
had to do things to get there and I was
like oh wait a second I'm creating a lot
of attachment to these things when in
reality why don't I just enjoy every
single step of the process the door is

[3:43:01]
single step of the process the door is
like a little gem at the end. Oh I get a
little a little reward there. Nice.
Okay. And then back on to the next step
and each step is meaningful itself. So
yeah that's the way I try to to think
about it. All right. I want to just wrap
this up. I know we're coming towards
I just want to add one one thing here.

[3:43:17]
I just want to add one one thing here.
something you said a couple of times
that I think I'm going to try to bring
this back into my vocabulary is to be
with it. I I know it sounds like this
like like throwback to the 90s type of
thing. Uh

[3:43:30]
thing. Uh
but that's a really good way of of of
thinking about it, right? Like I I try
to catch like I try to have these like
little catchphrases in my life. Uh so if
I can think like am I being with it or
not, that's like a really nice little

[3:43:45]
not, that's like a really nice little
catchphrase, right? that's something
that I can can't utilize in my
dayto-day. And if the question if the
answer is no,
well then I'm not with it. So where are
you? Thanks. Thanks for that. You're not
with it. Where are you? You're in your
mind, right? Normally. So can I kind of

[3:44:01]
mind, right? Normally. So can I kind of
come back with it? Return to the moment.
That's it. Like life's almost like the
call of return to the moment. Here it
is. It's unfolded right in front of you.
Are you here? And yeah, the obstacle is
often the mind and the narrative. So
yeah, glad that one stuck for you. All
right, I know we're getting towards the
4 hour mark, but I've got a few rapid

[3:44:16]
4 hour mark, but I've got a few rapid
fire questions to ask you and then we'll
wrap it up. So, the way this works is
answer with the first thing that comes
to mind. Some of them can can be a very
simple words, some of them will be a few
words, but as short as you can and the
first thing you can think of. All right.

[3:44:31]
first thing you can think of. All right.
All right. Cool. All right. Let's go.
Good stuff. All right. These are not
going to be serious questions as well.
So, just first thing that comes up, but
yeah. Okay. First question. Your best
purchase of under $100 that has improved
your game or your life.

[3:44:48]
your game or your life.
AI. AI. AI. And probably AI. Strong
answer. If your partner had to define
you or describe you in one word, what
would she choose?

[3:45:01]
would she choose?
Um,
loving.
The biggest blunder you have made that
still tilts you when you think about it.

[3:45:15]
not moving
abroad quick enough to places that would
were better environments for what I what
my pursuits are.
The biggest generator prop bet that

[3:45:31]
The biggest generator prop bet that
you've ever been involved in either with
friends or someone else.
Um me and a friend won €165,000
playing Chinese poker uh in Bratislava.

[3:45:48]
playing Chinese poker uh in Bratislava.
Wow. That could open up a door, but I'm
just going to keep it closed. What's
your walkout song if poker had entrances
like the UFC or boxing?
Well, uh,

[3:46:05]
I know I would pick something, um, out
of the box.
Um,
so I I'll go with the answer like I

[3:46:15]
so I I'll go with the answer like I
don't know exactly which song it would
be, but it would be something that
wouldn't have the theme that people
would expect.
It'll be something kind of like that
feels offbeat, but then you think about
it and you're like, you know what? Like,
it's actually on beat. And then you're

[3:46:30]
it's actually on beat. And then you're
like, okay, I'm I'm even more fired up.
Like, who the [ __ ] is this guy? Takes a
while for you to get it, but when you
get it, you're like, oh yeah, I get it
now. What's something you're really bad
at that you wish you weren't?

[3:46:45]
I actually like I wish I would be
amazingly good and loving doing the
dishes because it is always an eyesore
and I just cannot bring myself to do it
and and it's messing up my Yeah, it's

[3:47:00]
and and it's messing up my Yeah, it's
like the the queue of stuff.
Craziest thing you've ever witnessed at
a poker table. I would go with
um
like what comes to mind is the Berlin
robbery uh where where is everything

[3:47:18]
robbery uh where where is everything
turned into mayhem in in like in like a
second. Uh but but like if it would be
the like if I can relate something to
poker, it would be

[3:47:31]
poker, it would be
I just finished the the double like my
last I busted my last tournament and
that's when the stampede happens. It's
like I was carrying my stuff out of
there and it's like, you know, it's a
sad feeling like you bust your last
tournament and I'm in my story and all

[3:47:45]
tournament and I'm in my story and all
of a sudden I hear shooter
and I see like it's like being in the
Lion King, you know, like all the
buffaloos are coming down and they're
just like coming towards you and I'm
like, "Oh, I don't hear a gunshot, but I

[3:48:00]
like, "Oh, I don't hear a gunshot, but I
guess I better find guess I better run
that way." Uh, so connected to poker. I
think that's the craziest thing that
I've ever seen because it like it
happened in ultra rapidly. Like you see
this whole thing happening. It's just
like the scream, the flood wave of

[3:48:15]
like the scream, the flood wave of
people and then you're just there
jogging and and seeing people like uh
running over some guy in you know those
like like wheelchairs that they have and
it it's just drama like a flood wave of
people coming up against the elevator.

[3:48:31]
people coming up against the elevator.
And I'm like, that's not a good way to
go.
You know, this whole uh sequence of
event and that being like the final
moment of my WSOP. I think if I can pick
something that would be at least poker

[3:48:45]
something that would be at least poker
related, that would be it.
That's a pretty dramatic walk out
moment. All right, final little mini. We
just got to figure out this. We just got
to figure out the soundtrack as well,
right? Yeah, put a soundtrack on that.
Lion King sounds great. What's more
Tiltin? This is a miniseries. So what's

[3:49:00]
Tiltin? This is a miniseries. So what's
more tilt in bad beats or tech issues
midsession? It's tech issues like what?
Of course it's it's not even close. It's
something that you can't really do
anything about and and bad beats you
just have to shrug it off. So not even
close. Agree. What's more tilt in losing

[3:49:17]
close. Agree. What's more tilt in losing
to an aggro fish or losing to a bad rag?
Aggro fish.
I don't think it's I don't think it's
even close. Like
Yeah. No. No. The Yeah, the the these

[3:49:31]
Yeah. No. No. The Yeah, the the these
people really know how to get bads can
be pretty tilting. But yeah. Okay.
What's more tilting? Bubbling a
tournament after leading all day or
busting firsthand?
Uh bubbling tournament after all day. Uh
busting first hand in case you go do

[3:49:46]
busting first hand in case you go do
something else. All right. You survived
the rapid fire. What would you like to
be the part in
advice for the audience or the takeaway?
I know we've covered a lot of topics.
You went super deep and it's sometimes
hard to remember everything we touched
on, but if you could give some takeaway

[3:50:02]
on, but if you could give some takeaway
for the audience to walk away from this
long conversation with, what would that
be? Be yourself. Just make sure that you
know what who that is. Mic drop.
It's a good ending. I like it. All
right. Thank you so much for your time.

[3:50:15]
right. Thank you so much for your time.
Yeah. Yeah. Amazing. Adam, any main
takeaways?
Yeah, we went down some deep rabbit
holes today. So, I'm going to pull
myself back out and try and extrapolate.
We did a deep dive on AI and kind of the
use cases that each of us are using AI.

[3:50:31]
use cases that each of us are using AI.
The thing I was thinking about
throughout that was almost like choosing
your own adventure, choosing who you
want to become, and then using AI as
your assistant, your co-pilots. We
talked about stress testing ideas. We
talked about asking like what you're not
doing correctly, what you could do

[3:50:45]
doing correctly, what you could do
better, and really like not just using
AI as something to give answers, but to
really communicate, to really go back
and forth. And I really like your
examples, Rene, of these kind of panels
you're creating for different use cases.
I've got a few, but not as in-depth as
you've created them by the by the sounds
of it, but lots of those conversations
and how we learn. And I think what I was

[3:51:01]
and how we learn. And I think what I was
touching on as well from Anton is he
learns from conversation. I'm very
similar. I learned a lot through
interacting back and forth stress
testing ideas and AI is very good at
that tool to uh go back and forth in
terms of this is what I think this is
what what do you think why do you think
this and all these kind of back and

[3:51:15]
this and all these kind of back and
forth I feel like that's a really uh
strong way to learn and to uh to get
better at anything you're doing another
topic of knowing yourself and really
understanding what your values are what
you're trying to achieve what this whole
journey of yours is about in your for
most people listening their p career why
are you trying to achieve success in

[3:51:30]
are you trying to achieve success in
poker what's it what's the deeper reason
that gravitates you towards the game and
trying to get better and the more you
know yourself, the more you can make
choices that are in alignment with this.
He talked about his kind of give up
policy and I I pushed back on that a bit
because it's it didn't relate to how I
think. But when he explained it, it was

[3:51:46]
think. But when he explained it, it was
almost like giving up on things where
it's not in direction with your values.
It's not in alignment with who you want
to be long term and you're pursuing a
goal just through stubbornness and
you're just going for it. So the more
you know yourself, the more you check in
with yourself, the more you can kind of
see, okay, is this direction I'm taking

[3:52:01]
see, okay, is this direction I'm taking
in alignment with where I want to get
to? If Dan says yes, then you can push
through the hard times. If it's not, or
his analogy, you can't see your way out
the maze. It's just a dead end, then
yeah, just giving that up and going to
something else will free up time and
resources. We did a deep dive on health
and performance. And I tried to link the

[3:52:17]
and performance. And I tried to link the
two together in terms of thinking about
your health and performance or one in
terms of a system. He talk about energy,
how much energy you get from being
healthy. For him, nutrition was the
biggest key to to his health. He even
set up a company to uh uh provide high

[3:52:30]
set up a company to uh uh provide high
quality meals because he really
understands the quality the importance
of quality nutrition to performance. And
for him it's all about he wants to
optimize performance and longevity.
Those were the two things that he says
for him as individual are most important
for you. Have a think about as a
listener. What's your main things that

[3:52:46]
listener. What's your main things that
you use health and performance towards?
What are you trying to get to and why
does that matter? And then we did
another deep dive into stories and
reframes and the narratives we tell it
ourselves. And often those stories sound
real, but they keep us stuck. They keep

[3:53:00]
real, but they keep us stuck. They keep
us trapped where we're at. And we've got
to think about ways to reframe things.
So understanding areas or observing
areas you're currently stuck, looking at
the stories you're currently telling
yourself. Is there a reframe? Is there a
different perspective you can look at?
If you think the answer is no, you're
wrong because the answer is always yes.

[3:53:15]
wrong because the answer is always yes.
And working with those and playing
around with them and realizing these
stories are very malleable, very
flexible. We don't need to be stuck in a
story we had as a 13-year-old in our
30s. we can drop that one and pick up a
new one. Give yourself permission to do
that. I think that was a a really
powerful lesson. How about yourself,

[3:53:30]
powerful lesson. How about yourself,
Rene? What were the main ones for you?
Yeah, you touched already on uh on a lot
of great ones, especially me just
listening you guys talk and I was like
reflecting on my own P career. Uh the
reframes, the the changing perspectives,
the non-negotiables, all things I was

[3:53:45]
the non-negotiables, all things I was
like, "Yeah, yeah, I did that. Yeah, I
did that."
uh because we have to we have to
understand that uh our brains, you know,
they're they're not really wired to be a
successful poker player, right? We we
create in these these stories about
being downwind. We create stories about

[3:54:02]
being downwind. We create stories about
uh bad beats. We we we have for example
fears and that fear fear we predict into
the future and you know we become
extremely pessimistic. So I was always
reflecting every session be like okay
well these are kind of the thoughts that

[3:54:15]
well these are kind of the thoughts that
I have these are not in line with the
goal where I want to go. So then the
next session I would think ahead and be
like okay well when this thought comes
up how do I replace it right or when
this situation come up how can I come up
with a different perspective for example
instead of the downswing story I change
perspective wait down swing is actually

[3:54:31]
perspective wait down swing is actually
an opportunity everyone goes through it
so the opportunity here is if I lose 20
buyins and my opponent lose 30 I'm
winning against him right that's just an
idea of how you can change perspective
so yeah just listening a lot of great

[3:54:45]
so yeah just listening a lot of great
stuff uh we didn't dive a lot into
technically poker. One thing that I did
wrote down is focus on Bill from Texas
instead of Renee from the Netherlands. I
really liked uh him pointing that out
and it was really in line with um his
system, right? He was looking for ways

[3:55:02]
system, right? He was looking for ways
that he could get an edge that cost the
minimum amount of energy and that get
the maximum results, right? Kind of the
8020 and putting all of your time into
bill from taxes, you will likely gain
some information and through that you
can make very big exploits that will

[3:55:15]
can make very big exploits that will
make you a lot of money. Whereas if you
focus on Renee from the Netherlands, you
know, there's obviously there's room for
exploitation, believe it or not, but
there's less room than against Bill from
Texas, or at least I hope. Uh we touched
on something very interesting when we

[3:55:31]
on something very interesting when we
talked about kind of his approach
towards uh taking risks, right? In the
questionnaire, he said uh yolo and
gambling, a gambler at heart. And he was
talking more about listen you you you he

[3:55:46]
talking more about listen you you you he
gave I think the baseball right you got
to swing the bat in order to hit the
home run right and what stops people
from hitting uh from making the swing uh
is fear and the topic of courage came up
right despite being being afraid still

[3:56:02]
right despite being being afraid still
taking the step in that direction right
uh and he he shared of course he failed
many times but you know he he he trusts
himself that he will just get it back up
and try again and at some point you will
swing that home run and he was talking
about uh uh the returns of hitting that

[3:56:17]
about uh uh the returns of hitting that
home run will be way greater than uh all
the times you've lost it. The last thing
I want to close it off with was
something actually that you also touched
on Adam but it was that it's not that
you use AI or that you use solver it's

[3:56:31]
you use AI or that you use solver it's
the way how you use it right there needs
to be a certain sense of curiosity
towards the why instead of just wanting
the answers I think we talked about uh
don't use it you lose it. I don't know
if that was a real quote uh but you know

[3:56:45]
if that was a real quote uh but you know
it is now. So if you don't use your
brain to actually do the process right
and understanding the process of getting
to the solution you will basically be
dependent on only the solution and you
don't know how how the illusion came to
exist so you didn't learn anything so

[3:57:01]
exist so you didn't learn anything so
yeah I think that that really applies to
AI that really applies to to solvers as
well so yeah overall great stuff Anton
