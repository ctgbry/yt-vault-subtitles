the kind of deep work you'll do. And how

[2:17:09]
the kind of deep work you'll do. And how

[2:17:09]
the kind of deep work you'll do. And how
can you have an uninterrupted time and

[2:17:10]
can you have an uninterrupted time and

[2:17:10]
can you have an uninterrupted time and
kind of protect that? If not, you'll end

[2:17:12]
kind of protect that? If not, you'll end

kind of protect that? If not, you'll end
up yeah being distracted. And yeah, I

the things you mentioned I relate to

[2:17:30]
the things you mentioned I relate to

[2:17:30]
the things you mentioned I relate to
more as well in terms of learning new

[2:17:31]

from but as my goals have evolved yeah

[2:17:38]
from but as my goals have evolved yeah
my deep works also evolved with that.

[2:17:39]
my deep works also evolved with that.

my deep works also evolved with that.
Now you mentioned something about giving

[2:17:41]
Now you mentioned something about giving

[2:17:41]
Now you mentioned something about giving
up and this kind of pushed back on

[2:17:43]
up and this kind of pushed back on

[2:17:43]
up and this kind of pushed back on
myself cuz I feel like I don't give up

[2:17:46]
myself cuz I feel like I don't give up

[2:17:46]
myself cuz I feel like I don't give up
enough. So, one of my things is I I kind

button like is almost like I know it's

[2:17:56]
button like is almost like I know it's

[2:17:56]
button like is almost like I know it's
there sometimes, but I just don't like

[2:17:57]
there sometimes, but I just don't like

[2:17:57]
there sometimes, but I just don't like
to press it. And I think you mentioned

[2:18:00]
to press it. And I think you mentioned

[2:18:00]
to press it. And I think you mentioned
one of your high points in the

[2:18:01]
one of your high points in the

[2:18:01]
one of your high points in the

my given up policy all these years. So,

[2:18:06]
my given up policy all these years. So,

[2:18:06]
my given up policy all these years. So,
I'm curious to know what this giving up

[2:18:07]
I'm curious to know what this giving up

[2:18:07]
I'm curious to know what this giving up
policy is, where it gives you kind of

[2:18:10]
policy is, where it gives you kind of

[2:18:10]
policy is, where it gives you kind of
freedom to get out of things that you

[2:18:11]
freedom to get out of things that you

[2:18:11]
freedom to get out of things that you
shouldn't be doing, and yeah, maybe for

myself, how I could learn from that to

[2:18:15]
myself, how I could learn from that to

myself, how I could learn from that to
uh give myself my own give up button,

[2:18:18]
uh give myself my own give up button,

[2:18:18]
uh give myself my own give up button,
right? Um,

[2:18:23]
I mean number one is just to to give

[2:18:25]
I mean number one is just to to give

[2:18:25]
I mean number one is just to to give
yourself permission to to like just you

[2:18:28]
yourself permission to to like just you

[2:18:28]

know like the the the one notion is to

because I learned this from him like his

[2:18:35]
because I learned this from him like his

[2:18:35]
because I learned this from him like his
his introduction was becoming the kind

[2:18:37]
his introduction was becoming the kind

[2:18:38]
his introduction was becoming the kind
of person who does what I want the way

[2:18:40]
of person who does what I want the way

[2:18:40]
of person who does what I want the way
that I want to and if someone asked me

[2:18:42]
that I want to and if someone asked me

[2:18:42]
that I want to and if someone asked me
why is because I want to.

[2:18:45]
why is because I want to.

[2:18:45]
why is because I want to.
So like that's number one, right? like

[2:18:47]
So like that's number one, right? like

[2:18:47]
So like that's number one, right? like
no one else is going to be able to uh to

[2:18:49]
no one else is going to be able to uh to

[2:18:49]
no one else is going to be able to uh to
to grant you that permission. Uh so I

[2:18:52]
to grant you that permission. Uh so I

[2:18:52]
to grant you that permission. Uh so I
think like that's the that's the kind of

[2:18:53]
think like that's the that's the kind of

[2:18:53]
think like that's the that's the kind of
like precursor.

[2:18:55]
like precursor.

[2:18:55]
like precursor.
Um then the second part I think it's

[2:19:02]
being a man can be kind of a problem at

[2:19:04]
being a man can be kind of a problem at

[2:19:04]
being a man can be kind of a problem at
times, right? like we've been taught

[2:19:07]
times, right? like we've been taught

[2:19:07]
times, right? like we've been taught
forever that this is how you're supposed

[2:19:10]
forever that this is how you're supposed

[2:19:10]
forever that this is how you're supposed
to deal with something and and it's kind

[2:19:13]
to deal with something and and it's kind

[2:19:13]
to deal with something and and it's kind
of

[2:19:15]
of

[2:19:15]
of
dogmatic in a sense, right? Like you're

[2:19:18]
dogmatic in a sense, right? Like you're

[2:19:18]
dogmatic in a sense, right? Like you're
you're born as a man and you're supposed

[2:19:20]
you're born as a man and you're supposed

[2:19:20]
you're born as a man and you're supposed
to be like fill in the blank like

[2:19:22]
to be like fill in the blank like

whatever belief that you've grown up

[2:19:24]
whatever belief that you've grown up

[2:19:24]
whatever belief that you've grown up
with. Um so I think like part of that is

[2:19:28]
with. Um so I think like part of that is

[2:19:28]
with. Um so I think like part of that is
to also uh redefine what that means for

[2:19:33]
to also uh redefine what that means for

[2:19:33]
to also uh redefine what that means for
a lot of people. Not everyone. A lot of

[2:19:34]
a lot of people. Not everyone. A lot of

[2:19:34]
a lot of people. Not everyone. A lot of
people like are in touch with like who

[2:19:36]
people like are in touch with like who

[2:19:36]
people like are in touch with like who
they are and they're completely fine

[2:19:38]
they are and they're completely fine

[2:19:38]
they are and they're completely fine
with it. They have that like kind of

[2:19:39]
with it. They have that like kind of

[2:19:39]
with it. They have that like kind of
awareness. Uh but I think just getting

[2:19:42]

[2:19:42]

curious about that is is like a really

curious about that is is like a really
that's the work uh to define that for

[2:19:50]
that's the work uh to define that for

[2:19:50]
that's the work uh to define that for
you and not letting everyone else step

[2:19:52]
you and not letting everyone else step

[2:19:52]
you and not letting everyone else step
on that. Um and then I think we can get

[2:19:55]
on that. Um and then I think we can get

[2:19:55]
on that. Um and then I think we can get
to

[2:19:57]
to

[2:19:57]
to

running down this maze forever. And

[2:20:57]
running down this maze forever. And

running down this maze forever. And
that's even more unbearable.

that's even more unbearable.

[2:21:00]
that's even more unbearable.
