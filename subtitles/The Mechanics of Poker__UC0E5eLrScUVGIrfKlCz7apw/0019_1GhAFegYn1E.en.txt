no it's only linus okay okay
hi there fellow poker enthusiast welcome
to the poker ambition channel and to a
new video
in which we are going to be discussing
that thing that
everyone tells you not to do which is to
dunk
bat okay they might throw out a little
here and there on the turn when the
board passed but other than that they
tell you stay away from it
and i'll be going through some hands
where i decided to dunk at the flop turn
or
river in order to try and win the hand
because
just like in the last video we don't
have a great hand
unfortunately so we're gonna desperately
try to win the pot
if you like me also like dunk bats then
make sure to give this video a thumbs up
and without
further ado let's get into the hands
the first hand we're gonna start off and
we're gonna try to
bluff otb red baron using dunk betting
strategies
we decided to limp in we face an iso and
i decided to call from the small blind
the flop is a nine a jack five and i
decide to
lead out flop now in general i won't go
too much into
a very in-depth analysis of when to donk
bet how to dump etc etc why it's such a
great ev
boosting play if you wanna learn more
about that i
made a whole chapter in the mechanics of
poker about this
topic but in general it will always have
something to do with
favorable run outs or flop textures
giving range versus strange interaction
okay that's usually one of the main
points obviously there's various other
benefits
but in this case if you look at my limp
call range from small black it will
connect
quite good with the sport so from that
perspective i decide
to dunk oh to be repairing sticky as he
is decides to take a long
and the turn is a 10 which again would
favor
my range quite heavily not necessarily
that
he doesn't have king queen for example
compared to me
but how big king queen proportion wise
is a part of his range compared to mine
mine i will have it percentage-wise a
higher percentage of the time
okay and it's also less likely guys that
he has seven eight
or queen eight or king queen because we
have like the nut blockers
so this hand will probably go in some
bats
i decide to block again now you could
make an argument
to again split your range into big
sizings and small sizings which
i think sounds reasonable you could
definitely have your king 8 suited
together with maybe your king queen off
i think that sounds like an
okay strategy to use but i decided to
dunk that small again
which from a range perspective also has
some benefits
odb calls always hard to get that guy
out of hand
and the river is an ace and at this
point
i kind of have to decide uh what kind of
hands do i want to be betting
do i want to for example still be
betting hand like king 10 probably
not so do i still want to bend the hand
like jack queen
king jack probably not so i will
probably
start betting a little bit bigger i went
for a three-quarter spot
bet which i think is fine i think if you
want to be over betting
it's probably good to have a spade in
your hand blocking more of a villain's
absolute
stronger hands so i think with this bat
you know it's it's fine i'm kind of
saying that i have two pair
uh i think make a lot of sense for this
for this bat
also i had like seven eight i think
makes a lot of sense so i definitely
like my plate
otb luckily guys he did fold uh
so we win the first little dunk that pot
let me know if you would have won the
pot or played this hand to say
the next hand we're gonna look at is a
hand where a three bet from the small
blind
could also call a dangerous player in
the big blind so
i'm gonna stay away from that uh flop is
quite favorable for me
two high cards a few three bed linear
from the small blind
so i decided to approach this spot with
a small bet
could even go a little bit smaller get a
call from dr locke
the turn brings some connectedness
and i actually decide to check this hand
i don't really want to get raised
face uh 400 but
i call i'm not really going to check
fold obviously i have a draw
and the river is a 10 and
this is actually a point where i think
we do have
some sort of a jack advantage in terms
of maybe i have like queen jack suited
or pocket jacks i think are way more
likely in my range than in his range
he does still have i think an ace jack
advantage
uh so i don't think we should just rip
it in and
instead i went actually for a little bit
of small bet in general benefits of
betting smallers that you can bet more
hence
um so i could for example maybe not also
a better hand like pocket tents or
queen tank kingdom suited but
mainly i would say a jack but i cannot
bet too big you know because he also
still has ace jack so i think this is an
interesting spot i don't think he has a
lot of air
well if i check he can bluff me and i
cannot really call
so we're desperately trying to trying to
win the pot
and he indeed found the fault so i think
this was a good example of trying to
uh win the pop by dunk batting the river
next hand we have ace jack off suit
we decide to call it's a little bit of a
smaller race and we're quite deep
than three betting especially three
betting in general and especially off so
broadways will go down in value
and obviously big blind bats very good
player
flop king 10 8 i decide to throw out a
little bet
i don't think i will be done betting
this board
a whole bunch um you could even make an
argument
for betting a little bit bigger but i
don't really like this board for that
i think better don't betting if you
don't bet dumbbell small is fine
this hand is okay
but i wouldn't do this range or anything
hope floki decides to stick along
and big blind bats as well queen please
dealer
queen queen queen queen queen no queen
but a jack
does give us now an open ender and i
decided
to bet again i did decide to upsize as
two players called so
basically i'm gonna bat less
weak weaker hands less merged so i'll go
a little bit more on the polarized side
usually increasing your sizing
hopefulloki calls big blind bats fault
well that's one down
let's see if we can get the other guy to
fold as well the river is a four
basically sort of everything misses and
i decide
that right now i am going to tell the
story that i have a great hand
okay i'm running 868 if i'm not
mistaking yes
868 so it's uh like 150
ish over bet and i hope floki has
a dilemma if he has basically any hand
that is only one parent he's kind of
in trouble he did indeed decide to call
and he actually rivered us
with the king for that which is very
unfortunate that i think if he doesn't
ring
if he does a river of four i think he's
definitely
folding or at least a high percentage of
the time so again
i like my play um
just unfortunate that the river brought
the four
under the gun races we are in the big
blind and we def
defend the jack queen we actually
decided to lead the flop
um good flop for me he raised 2.5x
uh a 2.0 2.25 x actually
uh 2.5x in general higher stakes
less rake so you defend a little bit
wider than this kind of flops become
very favorable
so i decided to lead out which i think
for people who know a little bit about
donk betting this is quite a common spot
so brought calls on the turn
spotware are definitely going to be
splitting we're going to be continuing
down by the small sum percentage of the
time
and sometimes big i decided that this
hand is fine in a small
bat and both sticks along now the river
is a seven which is
basically catching you know we don't
have a straight but it feels like we
have a straight
you know those moments uh especially the
the
the biggest favor we have is in the jack
then off suit region
um i'm gonna kind of use that by betting
very big 1.7 k
in 700 uh in general i think we have a
very big 10x advantage and like i said i
don't think he has
10 jack off from under the gun and we
could have it in the big blind
usually allowing you to bet quite big
and put a lot of pressure
he thought about it for a little while
and he did decide fold another little
pot here for the wacko
which i'm very happy to take so thank
you very much
line is love on the button can we can we
bluff lioness guys that is the question
or is limitless gonna get involved as
well then it's gonna be hard
no it's only linus okay okay
well we did actually flop something this
time we decided to dunk out
the flop again a lioness calls
on the turn we can kind of go either way
i don't mind betting small again i did
actually
again a spot where i could definitely be
splitting small by big bad that's
usually how i
go or how i roll if you could say it
mine is calls again so basically if he
calls my small bet twice i think we
usually have the best hand and on the
river i think we can start
to get some value so basically i was
hoping for a brick
and make a big bet however 10 obviously
is not really a brick
and i decided to check my line is make
throws out a little
and i actually i actually thought about
for a little while and actually decided
to make the call
uh what do you think linus has do does
he have me beat or do we have the
world's best player
by the throat and we actually win a nice
little pot here
and it was actually the second thing he
actually decided to turn the three into
a bluff
uh which i think is a a decent play by
him
and actually i think he's capable of
this kind of place that's
also why i check called the river so if
you don't think your opponent does
anything
in this regard so don't think check
calling the river is good but obviously
you know
we can give lioness some credit
another spot we open we have the deuce 3
suited all kind of goodness can happen
with the deuce 3 suited so we definitely
stick along
similar as the 10 jack on the what was
it 986
we now have a 475 the board gets a
little bit lower
which usually favors when your button
versus big blind
was also an empty table he did open 3x
but then again it's three-handed on 2k
so you can still defend quite wide in
the big blind so this board will then
definitely connect giving up calls
turn we have a similar spot probably a
split betting strategy
will apply i bet small again
which actually with this hand i
do not like
yeah i would have actually preferred to
see myself over betting this exact
combination
um but i decided to bet small again
which okay it is an option but i think
this candidate is better in an overbet
and then asplate if we would have over
bet the turn i would have
uh probably made a very big bet again on
the river
now i did actually go for the big bat
but i think it would have been nicer if
we would have overbettered the turn and
then just probably ship or stack in
but it's kind of the same idea right on
the river basically we're not saying
we're value betting at seven anymore
we're also not really
saying that we're very bad at jack maybe
we could still have some small bets on
the river than maybe like a jackass of
diamonds or something
or maybe if we would not jack them we
would not barrel a turn
um so jackax diamond jacksex club would
make sense in a small bet
but i think big bad check is usually the
way to go here
and i decided that deuce 3 is a fine
candidate for that
okay let's say he has a hand like ace 8
or something there's just not much he
can do
and give me up did indeed decide to fold
so another little pot
here won by the wacko after dunking
would you have won the pot as well or
should you
start implementing dunbats in your game
okay that is the question
[Music]
bit too easy raising from
the sort of utg in a four-handed game
cut off
kind of head subtitle tag along i have
something that can flop a straight flush
so
obviously i'm present
we decided not to dunk the flop i don't
think dunking on this flop would make a
lot of sense
a bit too easy just decide to see bet
and we have an option
check call check race in general if we i
would much rather prefer uh basically in
general if you want to build a big pot
it's better to have more equity
so if we have those four diamonds i
think that's a fine hand to check race
probably your first
uh you deuce four of diamonds and those
four of clubs are probably your first
picks than those four of
hearts and then basically luke's four
spades but i don't think i will
ever check his hand cool
turn is a 10 and this is kind of the
most um
sort of obvious spot to dunk or at least
that i see
happen most in in today's games
or in past games as well basically the
board paris and
after i check coal uh basically i don't
have
pure air anymore a lot of the time my
range is going to have a lot of 10x
er or maybe like a bucket pair like 607s
or
5. so my range is quite bear heavy where
he can still have a hand like
let's say yes i had like jack nine jack
nine of hearts and i have
pocket sevens if i bet small any faults
that's quite a good result for me
and obviously i have quite a big 10x
advantage i would say
again not necessarily percentage-wise we
have the same but percentage from the
range that i check call compared to the
range of tc bets
proportional wise i probably have more
tents
he calls and the river is
a club
[Music]
