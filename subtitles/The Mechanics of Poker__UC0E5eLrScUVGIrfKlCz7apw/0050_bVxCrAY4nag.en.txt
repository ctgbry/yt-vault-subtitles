winning calls and we even make quads on
the river for a nice little 10k pot
and we win twice because villain had
zero percent equity

do you want to know what is inside the
mechanics of poker program go over to
the site where you can watch a free
one hour demo hi there fellow poker
fanatics and welcome back to another
video here at the poker ambition channel
in which today i'm going to be educating
you guys in the line
turn check raising now a small
disclaimer this is definitely not my
specialty it's also not a very freaking
spot like
turn check race percentages are usually
not as high as for example obviously
flop check raising
but i do think there are some spots that
you guys maybe are missing
so if there are a couple of spots where
you're like hey
wacko you really helped me here give
this video a thumbs up
leave a comment down below and without
further ado let's check
raise some turns so the first hand
the button opens to 2.5 x
we are in a big blind and we three back
so it's a little through a pot
the flop comes for queen eight and we
decide to see that
spoiler alert when the board gets high
it means it was run twice and therefore
it means we
have been all in at some point you can
probably now already guess
which point that was given the theme of
this video
so we see that one third so far so
standard
turn is a deuce don't really see much
point in betting this hand
you kind of wanted to go check check and
then basically if vidin checks behind
he's gonna have ace jackets tank quite
often ace nine suited
these type of holdings and obviously you
do quite well if villain bats
which he indeed actually now does a
little bit of a dicey spot
let's say he has a bluff like five six
suited for example he has two life cards
he has
an open ender we would still have to
play rivers
what are we going to do with the
referrals of a spade a seven a nine a
ten
a jack are we gonna fault are we gonna
call it's a little bit dicey
we do have good blockers in terms of
bucking his value bets and not really
blocking his bluffs
but so let's say for example the river
doesn't
complete any of his bats on the turn so
the river is not a spade where there's
not a nine not a 10 on the jack so like
half of the deck doesn't come
we might have a good hand to call down
with
i actually went for a different option i
just decided to
rip my stack in aka the checker rizzles
and now it's up to mr big joe again
and like i said the good thing about
this place i think i can make him
full the hands that have quite a lot of
equity maybe hence like six seven suited
five six suited knight and suited ten
jack suited these hands have
are alive and are drawing and could
sometimes block me up for example on a
spade river which if we now go in
that doesn't really happen okay it's
also less likely that villain has
a strong hand in terms of king queen and
ace queen because
we are kind of blocking those so it's
more likely has queen jack or queen 10
which i think is now in a very tough
spot as we can definitely be playing
aces or kings for example this way or
maybe even a set
so yeah actually i like my play villain
did call
and there's actually still an extra
upside
to jamming head like this and for the
people who watch the flop check raising
uh video i think the last hint in that
video i kind of gave a similar concept
that i'm not showing here on the turn
because you would not say we lose but
actually no we don't
as you can see we run a trice there was
a spoiler alert
he actually bat called with a worse hand
so that's actually an extra benefit if
he bat calls you with a king high flush
draw or asap flush oh we're actually in
quite decent shape
so i think this is definitely a check
raised turn spot
that is not that frequent but sometimes
if
the spot is right for it um why not take
it
next spot we're three betting pocket
fights from the small blind
mikey boyfriend folds angry ogre calls
flop comes queen seven
four another another spoiler i see the
cards are high
so it's gonna be all in at some point
and you can already guess where
see that so far so standard and turn we
turn a set usually when you turn the sat
it's actually a great hand
to go for a turn check race so i decided
to do that
in this spot actually betting i think i
think
both betting and checking they're both
fine now villain bats and we decided to
go for the
checker rizzles again maybe actually
this hand
and given this board maybe we could
decide to check raise a little bit
smaller and the other example if you'll
embed it a little bit bigger
don't mind check raising to 1.8 here i
think that's also perfectly
fine but i decided to be a little bit
greedy
the benefit if you would check raise a
little bit smaller like you don't want
the villain to be folding ahead like
king queen right
that's kind of the problem so if you
think your opponent is going to falten
queen there by all means check raise a
little bit smaller
then it calls and we even make quads on
the river for a nice little 10k
pot and we win twice because villain had
zero percent equity in this game the
problem right for
for for angry over here if we do have a
set he's kind of dead and actually
remember that he thought about this hand
for a little while before calling
so i think maybe check raising smaller
with my hands would have actually been a
cool play
and it's definitely a play that you
should have in your arsenal
and these are actually now two check
races in a three by
one position now if you want to know
more about this line
i recently made a little master class on
how to play three bad pods out of
position
where i'm doing a very big dive into the
turn check race line as well as it's a
very big part of your strategy so go
over to the side click on the master
class and
also there you can see a free 30-minute
demo
of what is inside the master class
5-4 suit okay
recreational calls in the small blight i
decided to overcall with five for awsuit
as we tried to make straight that's kind
of the kind of the idea here
we're almost there three a6 check
check villain checks as well and now we
actually made her straight
and the recreational checks and i
actually decided to check again
i think it's a spot where doing a lot of
checking again and playing from there is
actually a fine strategy
we allow the recreational to do
something funky on the river
or maybe improve to her hands that could
maybe otherwise fold
and we can allow the initial razor to do
some delayed aggression with his ace
maybe he's
already inclined now especially with the
recreational pot maybe start batting
some hands like jacks
tents queens because the board gets
quite drawy needs some protection can
get some
something value uh and i had like dance
for example would benefit if i would
now just fold king queen and the
recreational can call you with king five
suited or pocket force whatever
so i think he you will have quite a lot
of bats and basically a lot of the hands
that are going to call my bat
given that i'm gonna go i'm gonna
try to get some money in right so if i
would do
two big bets i think basically all hands
that would call two big bets would also
bet themselves so i don't think we will
lose a lot of value
recreational calls and we decided to go
for the check race
okay this is obviously a great spot for
us and
an interesting spot for roman i think
this is actually a great spot to
um kind of throw out like some mergy
type of
races okay good luck for us would be
like hands like six
five six four suited uh a turn seven
like seven five suited seven four suited
i think these are great candidates so
in terms of potential bluffs i think we
have quite a lot so if i'm
roman shoes yeah it's quite annoying if
you do have a nice ace
because i either have you very much beat
with it with a hand like 5'4
or i have quite a lot of equity right
with my bluffs as i usually
have a pair and a draw
roman calls villain fultz and the river
is a spade which is a little bit nasty
uh i do think we should obviously still
value at our hand but i think if this is
just a queen of clubs i'm just gonna rip
it in
now i think i should reduce my sizing a
little bit so i didn't go for the for
the rip it in but i went for
like a three-quarter each sizing
and roman thought about for a little
while and decided to call with pocket
jacks and this was exactly like one of
the hands that i was saying that
he's a little very much inclined to bet
on the turn and now we can get a check
raise in versus that hand whereas if we
would have just bat he would have
probably just called
and we wouldn't have been able to get
11k in the pot so in general if you have
a strong hand
the benefit of it when checking even
though he's going to check behind quite
often
the time that you do get your checkers
in you can actually build a way bigger
pot
than if you would just bet out okay so
i think this is actually a good example
it's called the river i think it's
pretty
nice i think it's fine like i said
there's just so much potential type of
bluffs that i could be playing this way
like i said the six five the six four
the pocket fives
uh maybe even had like ace four h4
actually would be quite funky
uh seven five seven four pocket fours
three four suited i mean if i fight for
off i also six five off
uh probably don't have seven eight off
so six five off
so yeah i i i think this is a spot where
romans should just
estimate if i'm capable of finding love
these bluffs
and if i am then this is a perfectly
fine call
we say thank you mr roman
mr otb opens the button we defend in the
big blind
with a jack six suited
ogb decides to use a little overwhelm on
the flop which i think is definitely a
preferred
gto strategy we have a
call here with jack six we could also
decide to race
but usually an overbet is quite a paul
more of a polarized strategy
so he either has very good hands or very
weak hands so
there's not really a reason to start
building much of a check raising range
so i decided to
not have one and just call so we call
turn is a four o2b barrels uh like a
sizing basically nothing really changed
uh he's gonna have the advantage in ace
jack plus and he's just gonna leverage
that now by using a lot of big sizings
and now we actually have a decision and
this time i actually did decide to now
raise it in
uh because i think on a lot of rivers
our hand becomes quite poor in terms of
if the river is an overcard for example
i think we're almost bluff catching with
the jack six which is obviously not very
much ideal
given we have a hand that now can just
check raise the turn for value i think
there's also some hands that want to
check raise now in general
let's say we have had like queen eight
of diamonds queen and the diamonds that
which are called the flopwater king nine
the diamonds eight seven of diamonds
um nine seven of diamonds these type of
holdings i think they all
make fine check raises now on the turn i
think actually probably we should also
add some uh like mergy is check raises
so let's say we had a hand like
six five that kind of blocks the two
paired so
let's say the six of clubs with the five
of spades or something
i think actually that should probably be
check race some of the time
but not really spot we're gonna do a lot
of check raising but i think it's
important to now
do check raise your strongest hands okay
on the turn and then basically on the
river
we will call down with good bluff
catchers and other strong hands that we
make on the river we don't need to
kind of slow play this hand
to sort of protect our calling range
to the faults and we win a nice little
pot
[Music]
olympian with the king three
decide to bet the flop
didn't cause probably a range is bad for
me
maybe not not completely on this exact
texture
uh given its h3 if it was a6 screen i
would definitely just range back but
here i could probably implement some
checks
turn is an eighth i think we now have a
check with our hand i think our hand is
yeah it's too good
to bluff too weak to value that so then
usually a check is all that is
left villain bats and i decided to now
go for a check race
if you look at the board we have
basically an advantage in all
the the naughty hands also in terms of
in the future let's say a king rules off
or a jack or ten
he doesn't really have these broadways
he i will make a lot of two pairs
that he doesn't have so basically only
the eighth tree off
is a hand that he has sort of an
advantage four but ace eight off
uh i can have is it suited queen eight
suited with your hands that he will
probably already
pre-flop i can have pocket eights um so
i'm gonna again use that range advantage
to kind of check race
again the benefit here because it's a
limp but let's say yes i had like
four or five off suit okay that's a two
over
and a gutter if i can make that fold
with queen three that's quite a
um quite a reasonable result i'm just
gonna use now my blocker two
three eight and kind of gonna leverage
my range advantage
by doing a very big check race and gonna
probably
bomb a lot of reverse
blink goals river is a 10
and basically now everything completes
so
yeah i think it's now very hard for us
to show up with bluffs unless they were
quite unnatural like a headlight king
three
so i think this is a good spot to keep
on betting and i think if he has three
eight he's going to call
but i have a three so that's unlikely i
don't think he's batting king jack on
the turn
i don't think he has a lot of flushes to
be honest
um he's just gonna have a queen or an
ace quite often now here on the river
and i think he is in quite a tough spot
and it's probably going to fault and i
don't blame him guys i don't blame him
he did indeed fold so we shift a nice
little pot here
another limb pot limp in versus mr osp
with the six seven off
decided to check this flop actually it's
a flop that we could also just bet the
range
um given we limped he checked back so
anything
high is better for us than for him
but i decided to check turn us at seven
decide to check again we're in a similar
spot as with the king three
not really cannot really value bad also
a little bit strong to bluff so we check
and i decided now actually to go for a
delayed check race and in general
if you're looking for hands to sort of
check raise the turn width
turned or rivered paris
i think in the river check raising video
i also talked about this
turned or rivered powers are usually
great candidates right because now i'm
blocking all his turned two pairs
uh i have some equity if he does have a
king okay we have sort of a pair
we have equity towards two pair and
trips and again i kind of prevent
him from bluffing me so let's say he has
had like 10 deuce
a gutter and an over if he folds that
that's fine but that's a
call and he barrels the river and
probably i'm in a little bit of a tough
spot
and then he might block me of my hand
which is not ever going to happen so
these are
uh to come back to another video that i
made red line blue line
these are definitely red line plays
right i could also call my six seven
and probably bluff catch some rivers but
and then that those winnings would go to
my blue line and by check raising a
little bit more aggressive
my winnings will come from my red line
and villain unfolds as well
and actually just like in the river
raising section or check raising section
i don't remember anymore what it was
um i saw quite high success rates so
maybe i'm being a little bit too picky
uh with my turn check raises so maybe
i'm going to
implement a couple of more
two video with the as4 get a call from
the cutoff
c bet the flop quite standard turn is a
deuce
a check fill which is going to do quite
often here a lot of
his medium pairs prefer batting at a
high frequency
and i am now going to race all in
and in general turn check raising in
three web parts
and in lower spr situations like the
jack six
uh that's a little bit more common and i
think this is a very common one as well
i think if he has a millish pair
anything between fours and tens he's
in quite a tough spot as he's either
beat by queen's king's races
or i'm sort of drawing it's very hard
for me to have
a different bluff let's say i had three
four of clubs
which i basically will never have unless
i'm maybe streaming and i'm in a very
funky mood
but then i could also have the seven
deuce so not not a great spot him for
here to
for him here to call with pocket sevens
or something
so we're gonna be putting him in quite a
tough spot and even if he would call
with a hand like jack queen king jack
we have a gutter a flush draw and over
so i think this is a very good bluffing
candidate
okay if it indeed
decided to call and actually the pocket
nice and
unbelievable guys we didn't improve on
the river
okay believe it or not
so these were a couple of spots that i
picked out to show you
turn check raising uh
i picked kind of a variety of spots i
hope you guys
took something from this like for
example the ace king
hand i thought was interesting the seven
six is definitely a concept that you see
coming back
in solvers quite often okay um
same with the king three so try to find
these spots where
you can increase your red line a little
bit more by using turn
check raises okay and
i would like to thank you guys all hope
you guys learned something
and i will see you in the next video
i hope you guys liked this video if you
