hi there and welcome back again to
another video here at the poker mission
channel today part two of our live cash
game adventures if you haven't seen part
one go check that out the game has a
couple of different rules we're playing
a seven deuce and an a3 game basically
whoever wins a hand with one of those
hands then gets 150 euro from each
opponent at the table there's also some
bomb bots involved we have the stand-up
game which actually the first hand in
this video is gonna be in a stand-up
game which basically means that if you
win a hand you can sit down and whoever
stands last has to pay everyone 150 euro
so it creates some interesting dynamics
as we will see in this hand that is
about to start
i think that was about it let's get into
the action and see what develops
so this is where we left off 16k for the
weka lupu crossing us crushing it with
18k and indeed
we are all standing up for the very
first hand you can also see a wick at
the table basically the person who
stands last will also have to play i
think for 15 minutes with that wig on
the hand starts with a limp one pick
150 from johan
a limp from the small blind and i bump
it up with queen for off
because i am standing
the other person who limped in from the
small blind was also standing so
basically
if he folds i don't have to pay everyone
150 euro and i get 150 euro of him so
it's an interesting dynamic that's why
you see me racing here with the queen
for off and that's why you probably see
him limp calling 150 with 10 7 off
flop is 967
which i think does very badly
given he found the hands that he didn't
want to race pre-flop then lymph and
then did want to call i also don't
really understand this limping strategy
i think he should just be racing a lot
or limp re-raising a lot um the limp
calling i'm not really sure
but
these strategies with the seven dudes in
their a3 off in their stand up game it's
it's a bit complicated and hard to uh to
understand maybe for example he doesn't
want to race because he thinks i'm just
gonna three bet almost any two you know
this could also be the case
but yeah i think a very good flop for
him so i decided to check back take one
turn is a nine
five
and he fires out 300 euros which is
almost the size of the pot and now it's
up to us and now you think gweko why did
you include this hand this is an obvious
fault my friend but like i said if i
lose his hand i'll have to pay 150 to
everyone at the table
and that's quite costly whereas if i win
the hand of my direct opponent i get 150
euro of him and i don't have to pay 150
euro to the rest of the table so there's
extra product so it's actually not me
calling 300 to win 600 no it's actually
me calling 300 to win 1500 or something
so i do think i still have the best hand
some of the time i mean if he has 10 7
off he can also have 10 jack off jack
eight off check five off maybe so i'm
gonna call and see what develops
the most terrible card in the deck as i
just summed up jack five
check eight eight five but twenty five
jack
and
he makes a very funky bet
of 75 euro in a pot of
let's see yeah 900 all right a little
bit over 900
and i start stretching
and
raise up my hand like what the hell am i
supposed to do in this spot it really
feels like an uh
it seems to be an induction size
where
i think he thinks i would fall for this
with
one pair type holdings um so i decide to
not pass out and just accept that even
though i'm getting like 75 euro to win a
1.5 k i decided i'm just literally never
ahead
and he's probably also not followed to
rate so i'm
gathering the 150 euro chips
not to put in the pot but
um
and diamonds we actually don't see my
hand but i actually have nine five of
spades
or nine five suited not really sure if
it's space flop goes check check and
turn into five and diamonds i think i
have an easy check with nine five spades
that's what i do i checked one check
and now it's up to johan who now has
an open ended to go with his flush draw
he decides to bet and it's up to us well
we've just turned bottom pair
and i actually think this is quite a
good spot to throw out a little race
we're blocking some of the two parts
that he could have made on the turn
we're blocking a head like pocket fights
that he could have made in the turn we
have an open ender as a 10 or 6 makes us
a straight he checked back the flop so
he's quite capped i think in general all
the ingredients are here to throw out a
check race bluff
and i indeed raised 500. he bad
55 so it's like a 10x race i think in
general this is good on this type of
boards in this type of spots where he's
just very catchy you just want to go
very big
he gives me the stair
and we see a river and actually big
trips on the river so this is a very
good river for me and i think now
there's only one thing that i can do
which is to hope that he has a jack and
eight i think he's definitely more than
he can check back ahead like king jack
and his jack some of the time and i just
hope that he has an eight nines tents
that basically have the nut blockers
towards a straight
so
i hope to get called off i think that's
the only strategy with trips here so i
go for a big bat 1600 1700 25. you know
when i was just six higher okay
thank you so lucky river i need to
change you play
actually i have a new guy joining the
table
and he actually bets 100 in the dark and
as you can see i snapped call 100 during
the dark as well this is the heads up
but
uh he's small blood i'm big blind we
have ace and he's king queen for mama's
taking yeah he's sir flow and let's see
what develops
so i asked him if he's gonna better
again but he's chickening out third is
an eight
four track
so we're going to fire out a little bit
see one bye and i think the calling in
the dark made it very
useful for us as basically we can now
have anything
uh let's say we had a hand like seven
eight
normally i would fold that on the flop
but since we called in the dark you know
and here we actually also see owen with
a wick and the chain this means that he
lost the stand-up game and therefore has
to wear
certain accessories that make him look
like a very handsome guy
sure flow makes it called king
and we see you
where is the deuce this is gonna be
trent in this series i was running very
well in terms of rivers uh i think there
was literally three scenarios where i
would just hope for a deuce and a deuce
game
obviously one night of poker you know
luck is going to be a very dominant
factor he checks and it's up to us down
the river
we fire out i think like eight hundred
one thousand no
i'll even go bigger i even bet one
thousand it's expensive
and he finds it quite expensive
i was not really sure if this guy was a
recreational or a pro lately i found out
he was a pro but he was definitely a
funky movie
so maybe in terms of bad sizing
i went a little bit too greedy there but
you know he played a couple of hands
funky he came in funky
i didn't know he was expensive
now i find it expensive
[Laughter]
very electricity
[Laughter]
i'm not sure while playing not sure
maybe
if
if i do 800
everybody's gonna laugh
we don't judge we don't judge
so i left this theater play out a little
bit
uh as it was quite a funny conversation
so far
he claimed that he is his own solver and
we saw that here
um it's up to us now and he
obviously is a horrible turn he bets
quite small in the turn i think you know
he can still have a wide variety of
hands as i said i'm not wasn't really
sure who this guy was he just came in
played funky so not really intend to
fold knight here straight away with a
game that also includes like three eight
that he could have here
don't don't make crazy finger
okay
eight three
four eight
what 1500
yes and i snap all the river
i think when the flush completes uh also
in terms of
how comfortably
uh he was throughout the hand i just
didn't think uh
didn't think he was bluffing i think if
he had seven deuce or three eight he
might have played it more aggressively
in some sort of way
so
maybe not that they raise pre-flop for
example in this race i don't know
i just didn't have a great feeling the
run-up isn't very good so i decided to
fall
next hand
we
got a limp i think from the two stand up
guys left which in this case are gonna
be peak course and
i think clement is in there as well and
it's up to me in the big blind i have
pocket knights and i'm going to raise it
up great
and now
small blind
which is quite an interesting spot as he
is now
standing and clement was also standing
um
so this could actually incentivize him
to re-raise a little bit more often as
if i just folds he can sit down he can
receive 150 euro and doesn't have to pay
the 150 euro remember this definitely
creates interesting odds i think it's a
bit weird again he went for a limp and
then for a race just like he went for
the limp and the call in the previous
ends with the 10-7 when i had the queen
four but hey i have nines i just follow
and let's see what develops
and i have a decision now
i'm not really sure what's going on the
hand spots i don't see much other
options than just check let's see what
develops
a king
talks about it for a little while and
900 and i think this is our real first
decision in the hand
like i said
uh
the game was quite funky everyone was
playing quite funky he's basically
saying that
he trapped something i mean the most
likely hand that he's saying that he has
is ace king
which could limb breathe freak which
could check the flop which could not pop
the turn same with aces that wanted to
go for a check race let's say he had
queens or kings
if he was in a slow playing mode i think
they will usually slow play again you
could still have a hand like seven dudes
maybe you never know or anything random
for that matter i mean he has ace nine
off so
let's find the cut
this guy
didn't strike me as a recreational
some
okay moves earlier on so i did think he
was at least a semi to professional
player
river is a three
and he now goes all
in
for i think pot again so it's two pot
beds here
and it's up to us and i give him the
little stair
and just try to make sense of the hand
in my hat i mean the guy is saying that
he has a good hand right but i was not
really feeling it i mean the limp the
re-raise yeah you know it all sounds
cool but in general in this game people
just show up with way more funkier hands
than i expect the same with the 10-7 off
obviously i saw him limp call because if
you win the hand you have to show it in
the stand-up game
so
as well i saw some other hands dubious
dubious hands pre-flop choice so ranges
are way wider than i would say in a
normal game so basically if you're
saying that it has a king let's say you
had a random king that the library was
you could have just sleep at the flop so
i think it's way more likely he's
wrapping something like really strong
like a slow played asus ace king maybe a
king jack suited could be or just a king
jack in general
but like i said random bloss i do think
makes sort of sense
i actually thought about this hand for
quite a while
and to throw in a little bit of live
roots as well
as you can see i was staring a lot i'm
sitting and basically i'm trying to make
sense of the hands
um
in terms of live reads as well i think i
was thinking for like two minutes uh he
didn't look the most comfortable uh
obviously my live route skills are not
great but
uh his heart rate went through the roof
i did hear i think it was fader holes
in
uh in a podcast about live tales or
something that said that the reasons
people were thinking and the reasons why
they now have timing chips it's because
a lot of players would wait
for a long time and see if a player
would
slow down become more comfortable
usually meaning that he's comfortable
with the situation as a hand
and if they don't
become any more comfortable and their
heart rate remain high and they keep
remaining very stressed that usually
they are bluffing so there was some
extra factor with the fact that you know
the game was played quite random that
led me to make it cold
what
[Music]
and in terms of
uh
if you're in the situation bluffing in
general right i always when it comes
down to life tales and stuff i'm always
like yeah listen if i play big pots live
that i'm not used to in general my heart
rate will go up whenever hand or not but
obviously at some point if you do move
in
uh
and you have a hand at some point you
will become a little bit more
comfortable what i usually do when i
make a bluff this may be a good tip for
online players who go play live
sometimes when i make a bluff in my head
i'm just like
wow
this bluff is so [ __ ] good or this
makes so [ __ ] sense that basically i
i always get to believe this is not this
is such a great play and actually notice
myself coming down quite a lot okay
so not making that read on me buddies
here we can actually see that everyone
is now wearing wigs basically uh the
poor guy our poor friend sir flo german
guy uh uh actually he had a german flag
but i'm pretty sure he's french
um he
lost and then you know i decided to to
to tag him along with a little wick and
gave john a little bit of a nice
necklace
see three races i go for a race from the
small light
is it four-fold
and you're on calls i think i have what
do i have oh no wait you want to open
the bottle with a goose i have queen six
this is how the hands went
up i checked sit one chuck
you're on well this side you see that
sit three but 150 and 150 to go i'm
gonna go for a little razor with my
queen sacks i have some back doors going
on in terms of straight draws but in
general i think 337 is a very good board
for me like i said the game is time rate
so basically there is no effective rate
that would influence the hand everyone
is playing very loose so i would also
defend quite a wide range here which
includes uh you know i'll hand like five
for off six for off any any suited hand
a lot of threes so i think this is just
a good spot for me to do a little check
raising 450
for 50 to go
yo thinks about it for a while and
decides to cover the back doors which i
think is fine
three cool
turn is a seven preparing the board now
obviously this is uh quite bad in terms
of
my gutters as now sometimes my gutters
will have no equity whatsoever as he can
have three or seven and then just that
so i decide to check obviously my hand
has nothing as well keep one check
i do think i will have some barrels
mainly directorials but i think a
complete yola head like this is not
going to be in there
it checks back
and the river now is a five which is
actually quite interesting if you look
at my more likely czech raising hands
like five four five six six four they
would have now made something so i think
the amount of bluffs that i have are
significantly reduced i do also think
that i can definitely be checking a
three or seven on the turn to kind of
trap him
um as for example if i have a seven he
has a flush draw obviously i want to
keep him in as that has zero percent so
i think i can wrap some hands quite
nicely here with a small bat thick one
and kind of force him to fold like some
overs like he currently has in his flush
draws
um
so yeah
that was basically the plan
you don't need to bet very big because
you know i'm targeting a hand that he
has this hand actually as you can see
there's 400 in the pot and everyone
already gets dealt cult
this means this is a little bump
and the flop
three yeah it's very lucky to have a
three in this pattern because you are
almost sure to win uh
450 plus 400 at least
8.50
300 with the ace queen it's a bit of a
weird-ish bet in my opinion i've ate
four
seek one called easy call on the buttons
um
himself maybe even a better hand that
slows down because
diamond got in there
his big fat is also a little bit weird i
think he could still have just complete
garbage like 9 10 or something
that he was trying to steal the pot with
another river is a diamond
the six
and he lines up for a 2 000 euro back
okay
and it's up to me
i have the decision
2 000 euro and a pot of 1 000.
this was right after we made the little
hero call with knights he went to the
cashier came back with more money i
usually think after a bluff like that
people are not really
are more likely to not make another big
bluff like that versus maybe even the
same guy so this is something that i
could take in consideration i think his
line in general doesn't make any sense
to be honest i think like i said just a
hand like 910 or 10 jack or something
that in my opinion makes sense but i
just think this sizing 2000 is really
focused on i hope you have a diamond and
you're going to call
whereas let's say he would have better
pot or something i would have been way
more likely to call because i think
that's the sizing that he just puts an
eight in a very tough spot
so
for the sizing reasons and the reason
that i just don't think he was gonna
throw out a big bluff again against me
straight after i just called a big bluff
against him
i decided to fold i thought it was just
greedy versus the diamonds
so anything smaller you would have got
paid off i would say
oh sorry
another little bump out that seems like
because we're going straight to the flop
okay
for 10.
check check i'm in the cutoff
and i decided to throw a little stab at
the pot with the seven out of diamonds
there are some possibilities in the
future
and basically for the same category
choice that i bet johan now decides to
raise in position
raise 275 so far i like how both players
are both and five and now it's up to us
and now you would say yeah well mr wacko
you have nine high you get race you took
a stab this is it
but i actually decided otherwise and
decided to make the call now why did i
make this call i think i can be stabbing
at the spot with quite the right range
obviously also johan can can race at
this spot with quite a right range we do
have some back doors
um
i just want to call and kind of see what
develops maybe we speak er maybe we bank
a nine maybe a gutter maybe because jack
jack and we can steal the pot on the
river
i just thought we were gonna win this
spot often enough to invest in
euros
try checked turn deuce no one improved
johan also decides to check so this is
kind of what i was hoping for and now
the river is up to us and it's a queen
if you look at the hands that i'm going
to be betting here on the river it's
mainly going to be a 10 let's say i had
a four i'm most likely to check again
let's say i remember the queen somehow i
don't think that's really the case but i
think i'm just going to bet air or 10. i
actually don't think i'm gonna have much
blush in this line or at least this is
what i thought
so i thought actually this play was
quite incredible talking in terms of the
the life
the life tips that i just gave you in my
head i was definitely like wow these
bluffs make a lot of sense because i
have quite a lot of tense and very few
blogs
one thousand five hundred
thousand
so you're an air jack high
to my surprise he's actually considering
it
looking forward
this is a clear spot where his intuition
is telling him this guy is [ __ ] with
me
but
his logic is saying dude you have jack
high you're blocking a lot of his bluffs
why would you ever make this stupid call
he's gonna show you a tenant you look
like an idiot
oh
foreign face renee poker face
i wanted to call that
three
jack heights
was a good call actually yeah i did it
six seven
nine yeah yeah
i was very close
you made that goal i was really close
like i said if he would have made a call
i would have quickly came and left
because this is so this this would be
the most insane call i've ever seen in
my life so massive respect for him to
even consider it
no you should not because that's what
you read bro you're ripping to me
or something
compared to nine and seven eight four
you don't get that many jackets
i should have believed myself and called
jakai and [ __ ] everything people would
have said that i cheat and it would be
nice
some reason that i'm thinking you know
that's what i like do but i'm not in the
game tonight i'm just like outside of
the game i i just i was so close
it means that i already think it's sick
that you even considered it
in my in my head i was like wow this is
a very good bluff i bet called the flop
i only have like eight of them very
announced very good you think i call
against another player i i want to call
against you bro because i
they're a great player so i was like is
there enough bluff in this sizing river
so i decided to uh
keep that little chat after they hand in
obviously as it was quite a sensational
consideration of a call
so what is the last man
oh the session i open up the kids small
blind
cool
and i think this spot i'm gonna do quite
a lot of over betting
so i decided to overbat 400 in about
155.
and you're on callsion has a very easy
call even though actually in this game
having an 8 is not very great as i can
have 83 myself so having an 8 is usually
terrible in terms of bluff catching but
still i'm thinking
call here
hoping for the deuce again
actually this time maybe three dudes
didn't hit
a straight did complete which both
players i think can have
think due to the river being a nine i
don't think i can back too big with my
hands so i'm gonna go for an 800 euro
but
you can see
i tried to bet exactly in the same way
or put my chips in the same way as the
last hand obviously versus the guy like
johan every time when i play a hand i'm
trying to
you know make the same posture not give
away anything uh but then again this is
only consciously i don't know what i
give away subconsciously obviously
whereas versus some of the other players
that you saw i'm a bit more
loose because i don't think they will
pick up on anything
yeah it's not a great scenario in
french that's the frenzy that i do
understand and he has quite a tough spot
and i think he goes for the tries to go
for the tail again somewhere underneath
the table
but i think having the eight here is
really bad so i think he has a fault
hence like jack queen or something i
think not become a better call what
and he doesn't even make the correct lay
down he's very disciplined
and i show him that he made a good fall
i think i
thanks for being with us i think you won
a lot how much session came to an end
you thanked me i'm stacking a wrecking
up the chips
and we profited a nice little 16
300 euros in this game so thank you a
lot for inviting me to the game johan
this was it for the live play session
not really sure if i'm gonna play it
live anytime soon again but i definitely
think this was a good opportunity to
make some more youtube content and
definitely something different than what
we're used to
from now on the next videos i'll
probably focus a bit more on the online
grind again this was just a nice
adventure in the very far future i do
intend to play more live but right now
my goal is to play more 5k 10k online so
that's what we're going for
if you want to see me in the journey
keep on following the channel i will be
releasing various types of videos to
give you guys a little bit more insight
of how i try to get there if you're
