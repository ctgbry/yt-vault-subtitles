Um then there's like are you going to

[04:01]
Um then there's like are you going to

[04:02]
Um then there's like are you going to
study before the series? Are you going

[04:03]
study before the series? Are you going

[04:04]
study before the series? Are you going
to prepare? how you're going to work for

[04:06]
to prepare? how you're going to work for

take their brain off poker for the

[04:15]
take their brain off poker for the

anticipating how you're going to be for
this series as well, I think is

[04:35]
this series as well, I think is

[04:35]
this series as well, I think is
very important in terms of both ability

[04:37]
very important in terms of both ability

[04:37]
very important in terms of both ability
and confidence and execution and all

[04:39]
and confidence and execution and all

[04:40]
and confidence and execution and all
these things because you're going to

[04:42]
these things because you're going to

[04:42]
these things because you're going to
need to be executing when you're on day

[04:45]
need to be executing when you're on day

[04:45]
need to be executing when you're on day
seven and hour seven of the day and

[04:50]
seven and hour seven of the day and

[04:50]
seven and hour seven of the day and
you're going to be tired and trying to

[04:51]
you're going to be tired and trying to

[04:51]
you're going to be tired and trying to
not autopilot and what everything. So

[04:55]
not autopilot and what everything. So

[04:55]
not autopilot and what everything. So
you have to kind of be prepared to

[04:57]
you have to kind of be prepared to

[04:57]
you have to kind of be prepared to
struggle in a way like be prepared to be

[04:59]
struggle in a way like be prepared to be

[04:59]
struggle in a way like be prepared to be
tired and having a tough time. So if you

[05:03]
tired and having a tough time. So if you

[05:03]
tired and having a tough time. So if you
have the study to back it up, then you

[05:08]
have the study to back it up, then you

[05:08]
have the study to back it up, then you
will do better at executing in those

[05:10]
will do better at executing in those

[05:10]
will do better at executing in those
tough times. All right, that's

[05:12]
tough times. All right, that's

[05:12]
tough times. All right, that's
important. And hopefully as well

[05:17]
important. And hopefully as well

[05:17]
important. And hopefully as well
also in the tough times where it's like

[05:20]
also in the tough times where it's like

[05:20]
also in the tough times where it's like
late in the day and

[05:22]
late in the day and

[05:22]
late in the day and
you're s you're playing for more money,

[05:25]
you're s you're playing for more money,

[05:25]
you're s you're playing for more money,
the final tables, like these kind of

[05:27]
the final tables, like these kind of

[05:27]
the final tables, like these kind of
things where it's more important

[05:28]
things where it's more important

[05:28]
things where it's more important
obviously to be playing well. hopefully

[05:31]
obviously to be playing well. hopefully

[05:31]
obviously to be playing well. hopefully
then you will still be executing well.

[05:34]
then you will still be executing well.

[05:34]
then you will still be executing well.
Um if

[05:36]
Um if

[05:36]
Um if
there's some kind of ways that help

[05:39]
there's some kind of ways that help

where you're able to feel confident then

[05:45]
where you're able to feel confident then

[05:45]
where you're able to feel confident then
that's very important like knowing where

[05:48]
that's very important like knowing where

[05:48]
that's very important like knowing where
all the money is up top on final tables

[05:52]
all the money is up top on final tables

[05:52]
all the money is up top on final tables
this is going to probably define your

this is going to probably define your
series in a lot of cases. Yeah. So,

[05:56]
series in a lot of cases. Yeah. So,

[05:56]
series in a lot of cases. Yeah. So,
those are the main things as well as

[05:58]
those are the main things as well as
