[00:01]
he's going in a tank

[ __ ] trip

mechanics of poker program go over to
the site where you can watch a free

[00:30]
the site where you can watch a free

stream with the hero car guys
this first hand is gonna set the tone
uh-oh the tone is not good the tone is
not good
reminder of future renee coaching

[00:47]
reminder of future renee coaching
current dueco which was to
try to focus on what kind of value hands
is playing this way instead of
looking for the bluffs as you guys all
know i like the look for the bluffs

[01:01]
know i like the look for the bluffs
and you know there's there's often quite
some
bloss in there i'm gonna check raises
king eight
i think i think it's a fine candidate

[01:24]
throughout the flop is your call

[01:38]
turner flush definitely going to lead
out i think this is definitely a card
that's
uh way better for me than for him

[02:06]
because

[02:24]
go to fight a river then it calls him
mugs
he also had a flush but a lower one

[02:32]
he also had a flush but a lower one
and that is also also an option of
course that he had a lower flush but i
don't think that is actually a lot of
combination
[Music]
little table starts here that i want to

[02:45]
little table starts here that i want to
share with you guys because we're going
to win a stack
jinxed it oh it's all the jinx let me
quickly open this table here so you guys
can watch along
oh i stack mr take your money i made so
many
so much jinx now it's insane i was gonna

[03:00]
so much jinx now it's insane i was gonna
say now with time that oh
we now lose pocket aces this is not good
losing to pocket aces is never good
it checks i'm definitely going to be
betting

[03:15]
make a little bit there
yeah now i think
what are we actually going to do gem is
probably the best thing

[03:35]
we did not stack mr take your money
that's unfortunate
and the car with queen jack because

[03:45]
and the car with queen jack because
there is an anti and we're a little bit
deeper
don't really want three bets so i think
fold or card both fine it goes for a
half pot so
some pot actually again in the other end
so the half pot

[04:00]
so the half pot
i guess we could suggest is a little bit
weaker
because half pot hot pot probably have
the best hand
but i am gonna you not gonna race
because

[04:15]
because
the read is not 100 accurate so let's
see if we can get this hand to show down
and
kind of strengthen our read a little bit
and i think the half mod could also
still contain like some random bluffs

[04:31]
now he does spot the river
we do have quite a good love catcher now
with the jack
he has been playing quite aggressive

[04:49]
and quite wild here
5126 he has been playing

[05:01]
okay
not really happy with the pot but our
sample is quite small so he rivered us
piggy is just a little bit too out of

[05:16]
piggy is just a little bit too out of
line so far to
to fold my top pair with the jack
while we open up pocket aces
and get a call

[05:54]
start with the seabed i'm going to
barrel the turn

[06:15]
and we would like a deuce on the river
that would be nice
don't care about suits i mean if we are
caring about suit
do the spades wouldn't mind that
erases

[06:32]
que pasa amigo
i have no [ __ ] clue what's going on
here

[06:45]
i guess i call
that is actually one of these blanks
that we were kind of hoping for

[07:02]
that we were kind of hoping for
so yeah in my opinion if he has a better
hand than uh
good luck to him it's a weird line that
he's taking
maybe he thinks that we're out of line

[07:17]
maybe he thinks that we're out of line
and decided to check raise a hand that
he couldn't really call with
like eight nine or something nah
probably like 10 9 or something
yes queen jack okay gg

[07:30]
yes queen jack okay gg
interesting interesting plate gonna
check all here with the bucket queens
turn 10 that's good face the barrel
or tents i'm gonna call again
river ace interesting

[07:48]
the river ace is really interesting
it jams hmm

[08:02]
i think queens is a very nice hand to
call down if he would have a bluff that
would
have to be like queen jack suited king
queens through the type of holdings so
queen's by definition is not really a
good bluff catcher
well that's a good turn we raised a

[08:17]
well that's a good turn we raised a
small blind e3 better from the big blind
we check out flop
turn we have easy call again

[08:37]
what would we call here with
i think still ace queen

[08:45]
like paris that are
like seven eights yeah they probably
also are going to be frequency
type of calls

[09:14]
yes sir ace king okay okay we got some

[09:17]
yes sir ace king okay okay we got some
of our money back we got some of our
money back
we had to to our someone to get our
money back

[09:34]
all right check me race turn seven
please charlie
i am lucky

[09:50]
i am lucky
now but a definitely interesting spot
could definitely be a spot where
i'm kind of leveling myself i mean i
know gvl is a good player

[10:00]
know gvl is a good player
um this one is very
weird
i mean gvl is definitely a good player

[10:16]
so maybe i'm just giving him too much
credit in a spot where it's just very
hard to come up with
uh with bluffs when is p a kennedy
coming for us lower six players
expect to hear something

[10:31]
expect to hear something
july ish the first time i'm saying a
date
and it's also like some accountability
i'll be giving uh the first webinar

[10:46]
i'll be giving uh the first webinar
and i have that in my agenda
mid to end july
i do think that is quite a difference i
made that exact jump two months ago so
far the biggest jump i have seen is from
honor 200 yeah

[11:03]
now i can i can definitely see how
that's a very big jump
then actually it's a very big jump again
to 500 then from 500 to 1k
that's a very small jump there's i think
it's the easiest jump to make

[11:16]
it's the easiest jump to make
then 2k plus is a whole nother story
and call it through it here with the ace
queen
do you know if there's a lot of
streamers that like lit
because for example i'm streaming at the
point of my career where i think it's

[11:31]
point of my career where i think it's
fine
to not to stream and play like your cb
game
but i do also know that there's quite a
lot of streamers are trying to move up
and also trying to grow their stream
that i think is very hard

[11:48]
wouldn't recommend that okay
i timed out
i'll be called here

[12:04]
he checks and do we have a financial
bluff
we're blocking some value but we're also
blocking folds so
not really sure we should probably bluff

[12:15]
not really sure we should probably bluff
this sometime
as the alternative isn't great
yeah now we're going to fold i don't
really i should have just bet the turn i
think
so what i was saying that there is a

[12:31]
so what i was saying that there is a
loss there are a lot of streamers that i
think
are trying to grow their stream and move
up and become a better player
and i think that's definitely a point
where you should just try to make a
decision
like what what you want what do you want

[12:46]
like what what you want what do you want
you want to grow your stream do you want
to become a very good player because i
think just streaming all the time
i think it's a spot where i'm going to
jam

[13:05]
german hope and he called me with three
pairs snap called me even with the
repair
okay thank you very much sir thank you
very much mer yeah and when basically my
advice to those people is

[13:15]
advice to those people is
just or focus on your career or focus on
streaming
but i would pref i think it makes makes
way more sense to really focus on your
poker career
and then when you're sort of there then
focus on uh on streaming
nowadays lightness microphone for poker

[13:31]
nowadays lightness microphone for poker
stay for wreck battles on 10k very
entertaining to see any reason
they play in first place on 10k with
each other
i mean probably a combination
probably like the challenge i'll try a

[13:48]
probably like the challenge i'll try a
little donkey donkey donkey
okay donkey donkey you [ __ ] dunk
you do it again i remember in a video
before i've told you to not
dunk why do you do that why do you do

[14:01]
dunk why do you do that why do you do
that
so dumb
man a nice little very on the river and

[14:15]
man a nice little very on the river and
he snip called me with then jack
thank you sir thank you sir heads up
specialty
obviously see that a little ten percent
face the race okay

[14:32]
easy call

[14:48]
could he play the same hand this way
i guess some of the time yes he's jack
okay revenge revenge in the streets

[15:00]
okay revenge revenge in the streets
revenge in the streets revenge in the
streets
revenge in the streets can i even play
in this game i mean what
they find oh i mean what the
i mean how can i even play in this game
it's like i just get
cheated i mean hand after hand after

[15:17]

kind of goes right who is the guy from
the why do you do that clip

check back here with the jacks
i do like the name best poker coaching

[15:46]
i do like the name best poker coaching
that's definitely a good nickname to
have registered
baby money okay face over bets the trap
has been set guys the trap has been set

[16:03]
it's not a great river
over bed river is nuts will has ever
changed it's not completely true or at

[16:15]
changed it's not completely true or at
least not admit to ir6
definitely not true
i think i bet the river now
not too thrilled about it but i think i
should definitely bluff
uh bluff hey i feel you vet

[16:33]
you thinking about it
he's going in a tank

[16:48]
and he calls thank you sir
that's my money now he had queen seven
river the queen
that was a good trap guys it was a good
[ __ ] trap it's a good [ __ ] trap
i still wanted to show you guys this

[17:01]
i still wanted to show you guys this
head that i played
but it's very okay this is the moment so
we raised the a stand see that the flop
he called decided to make a little
barrel here
he called rivers the queen i decided to

[17:15]
he called rivers the queen i decided to
make a little bed again he erased
and we came over the top and he went in
the tank tank tank and called me with
jack eight
that was a nice little pot for us
remember press the board this is

[17:30]
remember press the board this is
interesting
not really sure about the river though
to be honest
but hey you fooled it i need some more
clips for when we make a good play
every time there's basically two clips i
can every time choose from which is this

[17:46]
can every time choose from which is this
is how we do
it
and actually that's not true we also
have the this one actually old one

[18:00]
have the this one actually old one
cannot even see it if you know where it
is actually i'm gonna check raise this
i have decided
i need false we have another one which

[18:17]
i need false we have another one which
is this one
you're tripping with yes i'm the boss
we're open to seven deuce
let's open the 70s let's open the
[ __ ] seven deuce

[18:31]
[Music]
oh mr burns does not agree immediately
decides to go for the three bet
okay okay sorry well we face four bet

[18:47]
okay okay sorry well we face four bet
here
good luck my friend
he calls me with king we need luck
charlie i am lucky i am

[19:01]
charlie i am lucky i am
hey kidding me not even once not even
once
that's above average flop i would say
in our last hand

[19:27]
and they followed the river driven here
the packed queens

[19:37]
start with a little sibe

[19:45]
turn is close-ish
actually gonna follow it up with another
bet we're facing bet check
bet are you guys as curious as me i'm
curious
ha nine ten nine ten nine ten

[20:03]
happy genius oh my
god that's got to be the greatest guys
guys guys guys guys guys we being the
river
it's always tough if you [ __ ]

[20:16]
let's go for the gym
i think basically any ace i can now
probably just jam
because i don't think an 8 calls 10 and

[20:30]
because i don't think an 8 calls 10 and
calls
25 probably is raising him with a screen
that's probably raised so
i think he's just gonna it's a spot
where i think just doing a lot of
jamming is quite good

[20:45]
and also on that queen river definitely
turning like some hands into a bluff
that block for example pocket tents or
something i think would actually maybe
be a fine bluff
would actually maybe be a fine bluff
this is what they call
four of a kind that's when you have two
jackson when there's

[21:00]
jackson when there's
two jacks on the table me slow play
me slow play again and hoping for the
recreation to do something funky here we
go
come on million maybe you have made a
little trappy trap trappy
if million calls he's trapping he

[21:17]
if million calls he's trapping he
doesn't
okay recall
slow play
nine interesting actually gonna make a
little dunk

[21:31]
little dunk
ha he raises he says that yells he says
that he has a knife
yeah he has nothing by the way
what do we do against nothing we click
sort of we're gonna click

[21:46]
sort of we're gonna click
what's the minimum re-erase i'm gonna
click
funky hand guys funky hand
gonna go for the click
pocket knights that will be the most

[22:00]
pocket knights that will be the most
insane cooler he he deserves a bad beat
jackpot
any faults
that was expected uh it was just very
hard to get some money out of that

[22:15]
hard to get some money out of that
i wish we just had nines okay okay i'm
not gonna complain we had quads jacks
but obviously if we had knives he could
have a jack
now we will want to stack hey cannot
have it all this hand actually got quite
funky okay he calls here now we
definitely have to race

[22:31]
definitely have to race
come on blank the river and we win a
stack
one time no not i'm not gonna use my one
time in this end but that's a
good river god damn it guys that's a

[22:45]
that is a good river
yeah this is the sign of you going broke
mr kitt
this is why you play the favorite hands
guys

[23:01]
there's just check race here from mr
labonz
check the turn interesting
go for the check as well checks the

[23:17]
go for the check as well checks the
river
over check as well as queen 10 okay
from the looks of it i don't think we
won we had the pocket aces that

[23:33]
that was quite interesting
probably gave jvl too much credit here
and i probably agree with
real and this one was funky as well

[23:48]
real and this one was funky as well
three bats he bet small face a race call
checks back and he jams the river yeah
basically
yeah he's saying that he has a jack but
i think

[24:00]
i think
there's a fair option that he would play
ace queen
in the same way so that's why i decided
to call
that was yeah if he could play sometimes
play screen this way

[24:15]
play screen this way
sometimes he says jack and sometimes
five finds
a bluff like pocket deuces with a club
like a threes pocket force
at some of the time or maybe he turned
like six
five six seven six five suited for
example would

[24:30]
example would
make sense maybe he raised eight seven
suited didn't want to bet the turn and
get raised
now decides that on the river i
sometimes have jack 10 jack queen
or jackax clubs and now jam so i think
that's fine as well
what's this hat uh we got rivered here

[24:47]
what's this hat uh we got rivered here
by ace five of
diamonds
all right it was this spot right that i
said
i checked checked and then i bet he

[25:00]
i checked checked and then i bet he
memorized
who can lay this spot down guys who can
lay this spot down good
good boy i would like to thank you all
