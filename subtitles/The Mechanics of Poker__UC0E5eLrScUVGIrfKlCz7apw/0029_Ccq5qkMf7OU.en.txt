do you want to know what is inside the
mechanics of poker program go over to
the site where you can watch a free
one hour demo yes yes yes yes
yes welcome ladies and gentlemen
this was another sometimes i tend to

[00:46]
this was another sometimes i tend to
want to trap recreationals with ace king
preflop
this hand kind of represent reminds me
again they get it in with
with shitty hands so you should just
always stack
john this hand shows me i wasn't really
sure what to do with these type of

[01:01]
sure what to do with these type of
holdings on these type of boards
uh now i do know in terms of uh
this one actually i can review a little
bit i was a little bit in doubt if these
kind of hands would be check backs or
bats
my intuition said me that it was close

[01:16]
my intuition said me that it was close
actually color is closed it kind of it
gets mixed but then it becomes more of a
check and epmp
becomes more of a bat just this hand i
will probably take out of my pre-session
hand in
in a couple of sessions as i think it's
quite clear two new

[01:31]
quite clear two new
teams of youtube videos because we've
just been doing twitch right in the
beginning i did a couple of theory
videos to launch of the channel
then we kind of went in twitch mode as
we were working on the program and
everything around it so it was quite
time consuming
meanwhile i kind of kept kept the

[01:45]
meanwhile i kind of kept kept the
content going with some twitch
highlights
uh for the people who don't know don't
follow on twitch
no on twitch on instagram we have tunis
providing spot of the week
um so this is where we kind of kept it
going but now actually we're going to up
the level of content we're going to be

[02:00]
the level of content we're going to be
posting
three times a week on youtube so make
sure to check that out and there will be
some hand history
and history reviews involved here
i'm gonna check

[02:22]
i'm gonna check
and i'm gonna call the turn i think but
it's quite close already i would say
anything on the river we have to bluff

[02:30]
anything on the river we have to bluff
in terms of
sizing
i think probably a over bed is
appropriate for if you look at the range
that i'm betting
in general free tip if you're looking
for bad sizing
the more heads you're going to bet the
smaller you bet nice love to see more cr

[02:46]
smaller you bet nice love to see more cr
perfect youtube comes better because we
can watch anytime actually you can also
watch any time
if you subscribe i think it's not follow
right yeah you can follow on twitch and
subscribe if you subscribe onto it you
can actually watch back all the twitch

[03:02]

it's a birthday gift from friends i'm
very happy that he didn't call
how is the seven dudes going let's see
seven deuce

[04:15]
seven deuce
what do people don't know i think we are
we can now add a little pot to the seven
deuce
how much 121 dollars guys i think we're
almost up
we're gonna be up a buy-in soon that's
how we do it
we're running out of insane winrate with
seven dudes okay okay okay bad come on

[04:35]
let's see your turn my friend all right
let's see a flop i mean
do you use some rng pro commission yes
from time to time

[04:45]
from time to time
not as much as some okay
but yeah definitely from time to time
it increases i think in importance
tense here is quite a bad hand to call
it uh don't have a spade

[05:00]
it uh don't have a spade
but wait they only played one session so
far right or how many sessions have they
played and actually i saw they're only
going to play like five sessions or
something so it doesn't really say much
and he made it i saw a couple of
decisions that were a bit weird

[05:15]
decisions that were a bit weird
i i i loved i loved the one from
actually maybe actually i'll turn that
one into a clip
the one that uh uh
that fader plays his hands terribly with
the king queen and the ace jack axe
uh ball poke's anal is definitely right

[05:31]
uh ball poke's anal is definitely right
i would either check that one on the
flop or the turn there's
no no no reason whatsoever to be
betting that hand you know on the river
with the ace do specific
particularly uh
yeah limitless as like the best call in

[05:46]
yeah limitless as like the best call in
the world basically
so yeah no one really understood that
even even though pogba didn't understand
that and he kind of fell off his chair
he was like what
what actually let me write down that
i'll get that clip
for the next stream [ __ ] it kings

[06:02]
for the next stream [ __ ] it kings
okay i'll go for trappy trappy this time
did not work and actually i limp called

[06:16]
did not work and actually i limp called
oh [ __ ] i wanted to dunk i pressed the
wrong button then got here with the jack
then actually wanted to dunk the flop
but i pressed like on the right side and
there was the call button
unfortunately ace not really too afraid
of the ace i'm still gonna

[06:30]
of the ace i'm still gonna
do betting so now let's go for the small
bed here on the turn anna
actually i'm going to check again why
not
so we follow through again on the river

[06:45]
so we follow through again on the river
is that maybe a bit too much
i'm gonna go for the check call
okay gg has an ace gg well played

[07:00]
okay gg has an ace gg well played
actually this guy is quite crazy i
remember
this is the guy right dunk batman a
flush yeah this guy is completely crazy
but let's go mr tucker show us how crazy
you are my friend
japanese kamikaze pilot here's the hand

[07:17]
japanese kamikaze pilot here's the hand
so like i said actually a limp called i
wanted to actually dunk the flop but i
kind of missed it
i literally pressed right next to the
bed button
then i checked the turn then he decided
to go for a little delay i was
considering a check race decided not to

[07:31]
considering a check race decided not to
and the river was actually a club and i
decided to lead for what
7.50 greedy as i am
but he unfortunately had a flush and a
straight and ain't winning against that
[Music]

[07:47]
[Music]
okay okay respect to need too much tree
not gonna oversee with this board here
crazy guy definitely calling the turn
open 12 tables and bus nine because it
starts to get getting chaotic yeah man

[08:01]
starts to get getting chaotic yeah man
you got it
okay interesting bet i think first this
bad size
my hand does benefit from a small race
does it no i think i can still call

[08:15]
does it no i think i can still call
king eight yes nah probably actually
queen edge should race jack eight ten
eight seven can call
eight seven i would probably see that so
i should have races on the turn
but it's also a fine hand to play call
call so definitely value betting the
river

[08:35]
okay fault you know my you you know my
mother right first four bet
first three bet gets four bet our rule

[08:45]
first three bet gets four bet our rule
that is how i roll i wrote quite a high
number guys come on
you you cannot blame me a standoff quite
gto hand roll a decent number
and he just folds yeah was a good three
bet if you thought
that's some outcome-oriented [ __ ] right
there interesting flop

[09:01]
there interesting flop
oh it started off with a little ten
percent
just for the just for the just for the
stream i know you guys love the ten
percent

[09:18]
let me think about this one let me think
about this one
probably gonna split on the turn

[09:45]
a very interesting spot

[10:05]
why did the jack pair again

[10:15]
yeah this was bound to happen huh
yeah i misplayed this hand i had a plan
and then the board ran out in a way that
i should have
abandoned my plan i think

[10:31]
gg too big cedar man taking taking in
the pots
taking in the pots this one can go
either i'm gonna go for the call here
again a hand that can kind of go either
way and here
interesting i think

[10:47]
interesting i think
with my exact hand i'm just gonna go for
a bat
i'm gonna go for a big bat
turn turn turn turn turn
small bet

[11:11]
and now stack in let's get the stack in

[11:18]
let's get the stacking guys come on
come on you can do it bite
bye it's come on come on you can do it

[11:33]
bye it's come on come on you can do it
press the call button press the call
button come on my friend it's that thing
right there
it's a thing on the right it's on the
right not on the left the left is the
full button that's not something that we
want

[11:49]
come on man thank you
[Music]

[12:00]
give it to me baby thank you sir
thank you sir think color coding is
yellow as gto okay gto

[12:17]
i think i think it's gto okay good for
you guys
i'm gonna format this hand [ __ ] it just
because we can guys
just because we can
blue is for blue liner red is for

[12:30]
blue is for blue liner red is for
redliner i i do like this theory you
guys
i do like this theory okay we got a mono
board here
let's make a little ten percent because
it's mono and we like it
we like to do a 10 whenever we get the
chance and we got a table full of
fun players here we got a call here

[12:47]
fun players here we got a call here
interesting turn let me see now what is
now what is gto guys
what's gto gto is probably to check
that's a bad river guys

[13:00]
we hope that he checks that that's
that's what we're hoping for i squeezed
a little bit of failure on the flop
um oh two pair
two pair two bear

[13:17]
two pair
we got a two pair two pair
two pair is usually a good hannah
this in general i think is a good board

[13:30]
this in general i think is a good board
also to put some pressure on so that's
definitely what we're going to do
so let's start there that's not a great
turn guys
not a great turn

[13:50]
that is river but this seems to be it
okay hand to call i block
sixes like i don't block any flushes

[14:02]
sixes like i don't block any flushes
which how bad is that
kind of looking for him to have a skin
with a diamond
i guess but would he bet that on the
turn

[14:16]
turn
not sure maybe in this formation is yes
he has a hand like five for suited
rocket force with a club that's maybe
still an option something
with a diamond but yeah blocking sixes
i don't know if we should block flushes

[14:31]
i don't know if we should block flushes
here but let's go
gto gg gg sir
gg they were all there was and this was
also actually a reason why i
checked the turn because as soon as i

[14:45]
checked the turn because as soon as i
start betting the turn right
his range is going to become something
and basically there's nothing that
floats the flop let's say at ace 10 a
club skin jacket clubs or something
we kind of give him opportunity to do
something
with my hands particularly i think it's

[15:04]
yeah i think it's quite hard to get away
from
the queen six exactly like if i had a
hand like
and this is what i was kind of debating
right is it better to have ace queen

[15:15]
right is it better to have ace queen
with the ace of clubs
not sure not sure to be honest
shall we blo shall we try to block him
again why not
let's go let's go need to my tree

[15:36]
that's not a great turn
okay versus uh nine percent i'm
definitely still in

[15:45]
three
okay that's a bad river oh my god
oh need too much weed what are you
planning my friend
what are you planning my friend i guess

[16:02]
what are you planning my friend i guess
i have to bluff this right
ah he's just i'm gonna give up yeah he
would have snapped my ass
a happy guy oh we rivered the nuts
we rivered the nuts

[16:17]
that's more interesting guys we just
need to make some good hands
[Music]

[16:31]
so this is this is just what they have
to do guys we have to make the nuts and
big
basically it went check back turn over
bat
and then over bed again to actually who
is a fan of the channel i think he told

[16:45]
is a fan of the channel i think he told
me last time
call man come on find that call button
goddammit
ah ice king then ace king suited
let's go oh a sport let's leave it

[17:00]
let's go oh a sport let's leave it
online sir
that's a little bit online that's a
little bit out of line i would say
come on yes both for the weko thank you
very much sir
give it to me baby

[17:16]
blocks the turn again
don't mind that play actually i think
it's a good spot to add some of these
sizings
at some frequency to your betting range
here
we have an easy code

[17:34]
the river is quite interesting
i think actually we have quite a good
hand i think tents should definitely be
in his
small betting range maybe i had like ace
jack of spades
nah probably just checks but it has a

[17:46]
nah probably just checks but it has a
lot of activity so that could be
so i think then jack is a fine hand to
call down with this kind of depends on
his strategy
i do think a jack doesn't really block
much of his blush i think here his blood
should mainly come from
the yolos the six sevens but let's see

[18:01]
the yolos the six sevens but let's see
if let's see if he
does actually show up with the six seven
no he shows up with the jacket
that's not a very gto bluff my friend
but hey i'll take it
eight and nines did make a good river
though
if he calls it some of the time but what

[18:15]
if he calls it some of the time but what
the [ __ ] we don't care guys
because we're just gonna flop a set for
straight two recreations and get our
money in
that's how we're gonna play god damn it
all this difficulty with blockers and
all that stuff two recreationals guy
pots to flop

[18:34]
should we keep the other guy in as well
yeah let's try to keep the other guy in
if this guy was in recreation i would
just check race oh my god
oh yes yes yes i'm in

[18:47]
oh yes yes yes i'm in
oh [ __ ] still f no
no why why
why

[19:02]
oh that is a good turn that is a good
turn
what shall we do with this turn
i think lower flashes are definitely

[19:15]
i think lower flashes are definitely
checking i think with this hand though
not really sure i'll go for a block
again i think there's some hands that
probably want to block again

[19:38]
probably want to block again
mainly like your tents jax queens

[19:46]
