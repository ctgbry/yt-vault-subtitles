[00:00]
even a king i flush he could probably
just be bigger on the river
so then what's left is the queen high
flush the ten high flush
yeah no that was that was just a
complete uh
a complete a complete blunder

[00:15]
a complete a complete blunder
as i kind of already estimated
a little bit of a blunder right

poker action on the poker ambition

good to have you here today we are going
to analyze another hand that i played
in one of the weko shows it is a little
bit of a nitty river call and a spot
where i should maybe

[01:00]
where i should maybe
race the river while actually making
this video and preparing and
bringing up the footage i actually saw
there was another thing that i missed
which you know is probably quite a big
makes quite a big impact on the hand so
as always give this video a thumbs up if

[01:17]
as always give this video a thumbs up if
you liked it leave a comment down below
and follow the channel without further
ado let me
explain you the hand so this is the hand
we are being dealt eight nine suited on
the button

[01:30]
the button
and we are going to open and floozu is
going to call
now up until i made this video
i was under understanding that flu so
called from the big blind
as you can see fritzer is or was set out
and it's now set in
which sometimes leads to some confusion

[01:46]
which sometimes leads to some confusion
so let's analyze the hand
in how it actually went and how high up
until today
thought the hand went so we see flop of
king 65 and as you can see if you
haven't paid attention
like i was explaining a different hand

[02:01]
like i was explaining a different hand
this seems just like
i opened the button the small blindfolds
and loser calls in the big line type of
scenario
this is how i played the hand but the
actual truth is
flu's actually caught in the small blind
with the recreation in the big blind

[02:15]
with the recreation in the big blind
therefore we're looking at a completely
different range
but yeah i didn't really think that was
the case so here we flopped something
very good so let's circle
great analysis weka you flop something
really good so you call so
to go a little bit deeper into the hand
flows with check raises which you know

[02:31]
flows with check raises which you know
you can do still quite often with a
quite wide range as i thought we were
playing but the big blind
for looking at button small blind it's
mainly gonna be
i think king queen usually with a with a
diamond i would say
uh fives and sixes are very likely and

[02:46]
uh fives and sixes are very likely and
then for bluffs he would probably have
to go towards an ace 10 or an ace jack
with the days of diamonds
or maybe another pair or maybe a 5'4 of
hearts that you decide to call or six
seven of hearts
somewhere along those regions maybe ace

[03:00]
somewhere along those regions maybe ace
four of hearts there's a block
he comes unblocking which usually when
the flush comes in you kind of reduce
your sizing
and i'm considering a race seven eight

[03:17]
and i'm considering a race seven eight
seven
four i think low flush like this is
probably just calling
you can hear me talk about the seven
eight and seven four i was considering
raising these hands as they still have
uh two outs to the super nuts so a

[03:30]
uh two outs to the super nuts so a
little bit more equity
than the eight nine then i would maybe
also raise higher flushes so like the
ace high flush for example
and i thought kind of these middle fl a
middle flash like this like your jack
higher
10 high and your nine high would
probably not race
i was still under the assumption that i

[03:46]
i was still under the assumption that i
was playing but the big blind so he
would have maybe had like
seven eight off suit with the seven of
diamonds it's fine to just let that
let that hand realize and do something
funky on the river
obviously given how the hand actually

[04:00]
obviously given how the hand actually
played by the first small light i think
actually on the turn he should probably
if he did check race king queen without
a diamond i would say he now should
check
if he had king queen with a diamond
actually i think king queen in general i
think you could make an argument for
checking either way
sixes and fives i think should

[04:15]
sixes and fives i think should
definitely bet his blood should
definitely continue ace jack and the ace
ten
fleur's now bets the river three
quarters of the pot
first instinct razor

[04:30]
this size and do we still jam do we
still jam
that is indeed the question weko we're
all very curious
three four seven
it's gonna be very hard for him to have
lower flashes ever we have the eight and

[04:45]
lower flashes ever we have the eight and
a nine some
it's definitely going to be hard for him
to have lower flushes if he's better
versus
if we're about the very small blood but
you heard me say like uh sound like
seven four type of hand so i was looking
at lower flushes
and that was basically what i was
estimating if i should race or not on

[05:02]
estimating if i should race or not on
and spoiler alert that's a little
flawless this is gonna
call i guess so i'm calling under the
assumption
that he doesn't have much lower flushes
to call me off
he shows up with king queen which

[05:19]
is interesting
i think again i would especially the
the ones without a diamond like i said i
don't think we want to check raise the
flop

[05:30]
flop
i think we want to check the turn and
maybe even check the river
dubious dubious dubious dubious
i guess he's not calling that hand
versus a race
as it's blocking a lot of my primary
bluffs which are going to be
uh ace king ace queen

[05:47]
uh ace king ace queen
and flusho wants us to now play the song
and indeed i'm stating that he's not
going to call this hand to erase ass my
name
is blocking my main block with a diamond
you can have basically all higher
flushes lower thrusters are going to be

[06:00]
flushes lower thrusters are going to be
quite hard because they have to be like
7-4 or something so yeah i'm not sure
play this song all right i'll play this
song floosu i'll play this song
especially for you my friend
chicken song

[06:15]
[Music]
actually you could make an argument that
i think again i'm
my decision making i don't think has
been great today in a lot of spots
let me reflect because i'm thinking

[06:31]
let me reflect because i'm thinking
about higher
diamonds but king tank king jack the l3
bat king nine
so actually the lower ones could be king
deuce is that really check raising
though
yeah we have to get called by sixes and
fives mainly

[06:46]
fives mainly
which actually i do think is valid
yeah a little nitty-gritty mood
interesting

[07:02]
confirmed fuel player especially because
i've already raced
i think actually that was just a huge
blunder uh
especially because i already raised some
better flashes on the turn like an asap
flush
if he has an ac flush he's probably

[07:16]
if he has an ac flush he's probably
jamming that on the river
even a king i flush he could probably
just be bigger on the river
so then what's left is the queen high
flush the ten high flush
yeah no that was that was just a
complete uh
a complete a complete blunder

[07:33]
a complete a complete blunder
complete blunder wacko called it
complete blunder now
we're gonna take a look first if this is
indeed the correct blunder
as i said we're gonna kind of look at
the hand button versus
big blind but i think a lot of the
principles uh will align

[07:46]
principles uh will align
this is also as we explained in our
previous video this is exactly one of
the hands that afterwards i already
clearly know that it's a mistake so
we're probably gonna look
at it more from again a mental
perspective where did we go wrong in our
thought process

[08:00]
thought process
and what is the correction so let's
first take a look at what is correct
we are c betting one third with
our hand i think that's always gonna
happen and
out of position is going to go for a

[08:15]
out of position is going to go for a
czech race
of around half the pot and we can
see that king queen no diamonds
so the king of diamonds is definitely
the preferred one okay so it's actually
it is checker raising king queen without
a diamond from the time i personally on

[08:30]
a diamond from the time i personally on
these kind of boards use the randomizer
that
if i'm gonna reject raise my top pair uh
i want to have a diamond with it
so like the king of diamonds for example
but he's kind of all over the place
didn't expect that but it's not a very
high frequency
uh check raises are gonna come more from

[08:45]
uh check raises are gonna come more from
the lower end obviously sets are gonna
check race and we might find like a 5'4
with a diamond or a six seven with a
diamond
so a little bit more polarizing queen is
quite quite a loose-ish check race
versus checkers we're probably just
calling very sometimes clicking it back
but mainly calling

[09:01]
but mainly calling
during queen as expected we see a
downsize
king queen no diamond is indeed checking
as i suggested i definitely think that
is uh
the way better play as played if

[09:16]
the way better play as played if
he bats small we
don't raise eight nine of diamonds all
that often we do raise
seven eight of diamonds and seven four
of diamonds quite often
as i also stated in game so there my uh
thought process was

[09:30]
thought process was
correct ace nine and diamonds actually
the ace high diamonds were actually
we're not checking
raising all that often and maybe if we
have a pair to go with it
like ace king of diamonds no so
i guess we're doing way less raising
than i initially expected

[09:47]
than i initially expected
i would have probably raised higher
flushes definitely never raising 10 9 or
something 9-8 more often
yes so far so good river jack
left to i will turn up the squares if he

[10:00]
left to i will turn up the squares if he
did come to this river again with king
queen we can see quite some checking
without a diamond so
again as stated i think he should have
played his hand differently
if he then bats the river what is the

[10:18]
if he then bats the river what is the
preferred sizing so
i actually also said that not flush is
my gem and we can see
it doesn't really have big bets all that
often but the ace
the ac diamonds the nut flush does that
big some

[10:30]
big some
of the time so
that i reduced that afterwards in my
analysis i think is fair
but he better three quarters and now we
kind of have to look
what we're going to do and we can see
that eight nine of diamonds is clearly a

[10:46]
that eight nine of diamonds is clearly a
gem okay so it's definitely a mistake
let me see what the ev
difference is we jam and make
44 big blinds and calling so yeah this
is definitely
as i kind of already estimated

[11:01]
as i kind of already estimated
a little bit of a blunder right
uh let me see if we go a little bit
lower seven eight is sometimes basic
small
so the seventh four of diamonds is
actually never raising
so it is actually true that when the
flash gets lower

[11:15]
flash gets lower
uh we start to race less
and i thought in my head that maybe
eight nine was the cutoff point but
apparently it's
more the seven high that's the cutoff
point obviously we're never raising a
very low flush
um then every race

[11:32]
um then every race
and this is i think where in my thought
process you heard me
i was only focused on higher flushes
assuming that if i jam he's only gonna
call me with
flush and think that's where my thought
process is wrong we can clearly see that
if for example i have like king queen

[11:45]
if for example i have like king queen
where the diamond would have bat it's
now gonna call off the race on the time
same with sixes and i think maybe in
practice even more because if you look
at the
potential blocks we have as in position
it's like ace king with a diamond for
example
we can actually see that it's actually

[12:00]
we can actually see that it's actually
not a jamming ace king with a diamond so
a potential i would say over bloss but
for me as in position maybe i had like
a6 with the ac diamonds no it's also not
jamming
so especially i know flu zoo personally
and uh we we have

[12:16]
and uh we we have
at least an aggressive dynamic so i
don't think we're gonna do a lot of hero
folding against each other
so i do think he would have been able to
put me on enough bluffs to
call off a value hand like the one he
had so
from that point i think it's a very big

[12:31]
from that point i think it's a very big
blunder mainly that i'm focusing too
much
on okay higher flushes which
actually are often tree bed as well
pre-flop so that's already reduced
but mainly i think the mistake is that i
was not really thinking in terms of my

[12:46]
was not really thinking in terms of my
own range do i have a lot of hands that
when i jam
he could put me on as a bluff and
therefore call wider i think that was
a bigger mistake now obviously if he
would have played this hand
uh button versus small blind he would
never ever
actually have lower flushes fives and

[13:02]
actually have lower flushes fives and
sixes though would become a bigger
portion of his range
same with like nut flushes so actually
versus the small blind i'm not sure what
i would have
done but i think it's quite close
probably becomes a call

[13:16]
probably becomes a call
so maybe i accidentally played the hand
correct
but as i stated i think it's actually
more of a mental game mistake
and as we learned in our last
video we have to go through the steps of

[13:30]
video we have to go through the steps of
jarrett handler the mental and history
describe what went wrong in the hand
well we didn't make a value raise in a
spot that we should have made a value
raise
step 2 explain why you reacted this way
why did it make sense
for you at that time well if the

[13:45]
for you at that time well if the
criteria for jamming
are he has to call with lower flushes
more often than higher flushes might
it's indeed correct
what i missed okay what is the flaw the
flaw
is that i thought about that he would
also have other hands that he could call

[14:01]
also have other hands that he could call
me with
okay so what is the correction the
correction that
in this kind of spots i should be less
focused on
does he have higher flashes than me but
more focused on
is he going to pay off okay his value

[14:17]
is he going to pay off okay his value
bet range which are also contained two
pairs and stats
often enough in order for me to now make
the value jam
that would be a way better question to
ask yourself okay
so because i asked myself does he have
higher flushes more often than lower

[14:31]
higher flushes more often than lower
flushes
the answer was yes therefore i called so
the question i asked myself in game was
clearly wrong
should have asked myself a better
question
why is this correct and what can we
learn from this
from this again we can learn how to

[14:46]
from this again we can learn how to
better shape our decision making process
because in the end guys
the better players they think about the
right things
more often than you do okay
their decision-making process is better
they're considering the right things

[15:01]
they're considering the right things
you might consider different things than
they are considering okay you might ask
yourself different questions
than they are asking they see the spot
differently because
they ask themselves different questions
so which
question should you ask yourself more

[15:15]
question should you ask yourself more
often
in order to make better decisions and
which questions are you asking yourself
too often which lead to poor decisions
