am i wrong

[01:03]
don't think i'm wrong alright bump ups

bump butts are fun

[01:24]
let's follow it up with a small bet ski

[01:36]
followed up with another small bat
scheme

[01:45]
ah ten percent of your faults
what a cheap ass what the cheapest
[ __ ] these guys
ukraine
so cheap
oh cheap these three is suited and
pretty so obvious they were going to be
in there

[02:09]
this deuce here is close
close it's closed

[02:19]
i think i can literally do anything with
this hand
and whenever we can do anything we
usually roll high
when we're streaming

[02:31]
when we're streaming
no that's not true awesome we're not
streaming hello renee and good luck at
the tables thank you very much sir okay
i actually get a raise
shout out to this guy
a russian aggression
[ __ ] russians

[02:47]
[ __ ] russians
sure pisses me off though goddammit i
always contemplate
this afterwards are pushing me around
i'm just convinced that the son of a
[ __ ] are pushing me around

[03:00]
i was blocking ace queen so
oh and with his king
seems uh
quite standard standard standard
he's thinking about it
what the [ __ ] let's gamble rolling baby

[03:15]
what the [ __ ] let's gamble rolling baby
baby girl here we go baby girl
here we go okay
come on [ __ ]
you hat
jax oh my god
king king king king come on

[03:39]
i have bad news guys
bad news you got anything good

[03:50]
you can see
but the river brought the flush
okay new pajama bathing coming
yeah it looks like it there now we're
just playing we're just playing the 7ds

[04:00]
just playing we're just playing the 7ds
for fun you know if we're in the mood we
play
kind of how how we roll right
actually going to shut down
[Music]

[04:16]
it's quite a big bet on the flop
off pot
not really sure what's up
a good term for my range

[04:30]
fortunately the recreational here left
it was definitely fun to play with

[04:45]
i'm just gonna fold this one i think the
five is quite good for my range seventh
and eighth now are better defense so
i already started the flop half pot
which i find a bit
suspicious
or at least it leads me to

[05:00]
or at least it leads me to
want to fold a little bit
a little bit more
not huge but
this flop can actually go actually let's
let's do something funky
why the [ __ ] not

[05:16]
why the [ __ ] not
a little over bet here and he falls does
the excellent play then okay whatever
what do you make of this play this is
this is getting spicy this is getting
spicy this is spicy as [ __ ] spice
spice

[05:30]
spice
very spicy play i completely agree a
little cheerful monster i still have no
clue what the [ __ ] the chairs mean but
hey thank you for cheering me on
we face a barrel quite a big one quite a
good turn for us but i think the only
thing we can do is call

[05:48]
here pocket dance we decide slow
play he james river
i think having a spade is good
as we don't really block
his
bluffs right he's gonna give up spade so

[06:00]
bluffs right he's gonna give up spade so
i think king queen of spades is probably
your primary call candidate
and he has a bluffy bluffy bluffy which
is good for us
and that was his moment where he decided
to go for it bad timing the pocket tents

[06:16]
to go for it bad timing the pocket tents
here are a bit dicey
i think i'm gonna check
he had
ohani makoysa as they say in portuguese
which basically means he had nothing
and they both have nothing which was
very likely so

[06:31]
very likely so
never gonna make any money there but hey
we did ship a little by and there
without having to do anything you need
some help playing three bad pots out of
position well for that we have created
our master classes in which we dedicate
one coaching program to dive very deep

[06:46]
one coaching program to dive very deep
into a specific spot go over to the site
pokermission.com master classes and
eliminate those weaknesses
seven to suit it
ah
said in the suit it might something
might happen guys something might happen

[07:00]
might happen guys something might happen
with the 7d suited i'm pretty sure
something might happen with the 7d
suited
pretty sure
what do you think buddy

[07:16]
what do you think buddy
what are you thinking
oh got a show
and he falls oh show did i show
ah [ __ ] i think i didn't show

[07:31]
ah [ __ ] i think i didn't show
guys we're on fire with the seven deuce
we are on [ __ ] fire
i just show them drunken style and i
think it's good for poker like bring
some fun enjoyment

[07:46]
here
can do a bit of everything
um
let's do something funky
being in a funky mood today guys

[08:08]
probably without a spade this is never a
thing
unless you river trips and it's always a
thing

[08:18]
oh we go on excellent river
um

[08:34]
and he calls ha thank you very much sir
ace
king right thank you very much sir
give it to me baby

[08:48]
[Music]

[09:14]
this should actually still be okay for

[09:15]
this should actually still be okay for
love for me even though it's quite low
don't think he hoped opens deuces threes
fours
and if you would he wouldn't always call
it on a three bet
i think this turn is interesting

[09:33]
i think i'm going to barrel

[09:51]
okay so if we have nothing we should not
be the caller but the aggressor that's
how it gets that's how it works
not forget that

[10:04]
nacho david jones and bonk
what a game

[10:18]
jack nine
i'll take a seven of diamonds and eight
of diamonds leader

you can give him quads i have no problem

[10:30]
you can give him quads i have no problem
with that whatsoever

timing
very bad timing i am lucky i am skillful
