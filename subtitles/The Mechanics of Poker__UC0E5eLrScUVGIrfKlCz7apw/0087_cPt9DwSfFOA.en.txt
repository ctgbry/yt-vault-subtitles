in terms of if we should call a barrel

[07:09]
in terms of if we should call a barrel

[07:10]
in terms of if we should call a barrel
with this hand.

[07:16]
I think we probably should have.

[07:20]
I think we probably should have.

[07:20]
I think we probably should have.
Now the river decision is if we have to

[07:21]
Now the river decision is if we have to

[07:22]
Now the river decision is if we have to
bluff this.

[07:24]
bluff this.

[07:24]
bluff this.
I think that answer is probably

[07:29]
it's not that much of a bad idea. So

[07:32]
it's not that much of a bad idea. So

[07:32]
it's not that much of a bad idea. So
let's go for that

[07:36]
in these positions.

[07:38]
in these positions.

[07:38]
in these positions.
I think this play is okay.

[07:44]
Like I don't have o 8 910 910 and stuff.

[07:49]
Like I don't have o 8 910 910 and stuff.

[07:49]
Like I don't have o 8 910 910 and stuff.
I will also three pre flop quite often

[07:50]
I will also three pre flop quite often

[07:50]
I will also three pre flop quite often
check race. So I don't really have much

[07:52]
check race. So I don't really have much

[07:52]
check race. So I don't really have much
air anymore. I don't check call king 10.

[07:56]
air anymore. I don't check call king 10.

[07:56]
air anymore. I don't check call king 10.
So yeah would much rather raise king 10
