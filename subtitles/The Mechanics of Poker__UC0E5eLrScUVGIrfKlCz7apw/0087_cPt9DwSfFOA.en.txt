And now they all want a piece of the
wacko. As you can see, table filled up
five-handed
cuz they all want a piece of that
wacko's monies.

Got a little announcement for you guys
because next to our mechanics of poker
program and master classes, we have now
released the poker ambition academy. In
this academy, you will be receiving
weekly interactive webinars based on
your pain points. We will be discussing
all areas that you can improve in to
become a more successful poker player
taught by coaches who have walked the
path that you're currently walking. So
if you're interested, go over to the
site and I'm looking forward to seeing
you in the academy. Snap raise here from
Mr. Maximus. A board that I'm not going
to be sibling a lot, but I thought this
hand was okay. I started with a call.
I think not having a heart actually is
quite good. I think in general having an
ace and a king is quite good.
So actually I think I'm going to proceed
one more.
It's not a great river.
And I think on this exact river I am
going to fold as I think for example a
hand that he could have race flop bet
turn with was 67 or 78.
Maybe he goes even wilder and adds a
hand like jack nine in there but I'm not
100% sure. I am tempted though.
Close, close, close, close, close,
close. Putting me on the spot here in
the first hand. Mr. Maxim server says he
wants more doggo content. Please
elaborate.
Doggo. So, they want to see Bella more
often. Bella, where are you, Bella?
Sorry, Bella. I know you're sleeping.
Oh, she even starts to uh I woke her up
from her sleep. Here, Star Fox. Just for
you, my friend.
She's watching you, man. Star Fox, she's
coming for you. She's coming for you
with this little cute pink stuff in her
hair. Sorry for waking you up, but you
know, servox orders. You look like a
mature line is love. Okay, first webinar
really great. I'm looking forward to the
next ones, says Masquez. Thank you very
much. He's referring to webinars given
in the academy. Could see that. Could
check. Oh, really? Wacko,
you're explaining the options that you
have when your Danish razor in position.
Now I'm going to go for a delay
face a check race
which I'm quite happy about.
I'm going to make the call.
I was going to say I personally hope he
downsizes as then he can still have a
hand like king four jack six.
Oh, he did have jack six, but he had
diamonds to go with it. Hello, Echo.
Have been loving the YouTube content and
glad I've been able to catch your stream
here.
Thank you very much. Yeah, actually I
when I looked back the H3 video when it
uh got released, so the one from
yesterday, I was actually also really
happy with how it turned out. Definitely
one of my better videos. So if you have
not seen that one yet, go check it. I'm
going to go for a little check race
here.
[Music]
Yeah, I was thinking this is a good
candidate to check race, But at the same
time, he's not really going to bet. So,
I thought maybe to bet myself,
but I decided not to. Oh, this can get
interesting. This can get interesting.
Let's try a small bet. I think his fault
percentage here is going to be zero. As
I just stated, I think it's 4% is going
to be zero. Now leads out.
Not too big. Don't want to scare him
off.
Thing is he has been so random.
Don't think he has a queen all that
often. I think there is still a good
chance he basically has nothing. So I
will I used the small sizing. He did
have nothing.
This is something that I would only do
in position versus a guy who I think is
absolutely out of his mind, which
this guy definitely qualifies. And now
they all want a piece of the wacko. As
you can see, table filled up five-handed
cuz they all want a piece of that
wacko's monies. It's the life of a
Twitcher.
This go set.
No set, no bet
our policy.
Get a call.
It's always quite hard to get value when
you have two tents. It's very unlikely
that your opponent has tents. t like the
success rate of a barrel here if you
have 10 or sevens is going to be quite
high. Do you need some help playing
three bets out of position? Well, for
that we have created our master classes
in which we dedicate one coaching
program to dive very deep into a
specific spot. Go over to the site
poker.com/masterclasses
and eliminate those weaknesses.
[Music]
Um,
A10 is quite interesting
in terms of if we should call a barrel
with this hand.
I think we probably should have.
Now the river decision is if we have to
bluff this.
I think that answer is probably
it's not that much of a bad idea. So
let's go for that
in these positions.
I think this play is okay.
Like I don't have o 8 910 910 and stuff.
I will also three pre flop quite often
check race. So I don't really have much
air anymore. I don't check call king 10.
So yeah would much rather raise king 10
with a uh with a diamond for example.
There's a forward there with the ace
jack going to call.
And we stabbed the queens here on the
turn.
Plays a call.
Get a check there. Check as well.
Face a small delay here.
Is all in. That's quite unfortunate.
Basically, he's saying that he has kings
or
like a lowish flush,
which you know, two valid hands.
Ret four, I don't really think it's
going to be in his range all that often.
Think he could definitely have an ace
himself. That's kind of the problem.
Uh, this kind of sucks.
Okay, he bluffed me with 89.
Interesting bluff.
Interesting bluff. And here actually we
threw a little donkey donkey donkey in
the flop after calling from the small
blind. This is actually way more
interesting hand.
There we go for the overb. Over bet.
Come on. On your bike.
On your bike.
To be fair, you had a set. So, do have a
parless draw here with the Jack Five.
Let's continue.
Let the guy do something stupid.
Actually, we can also sit out at Zoom.
We have some other tables going on.
I think going for check race on the
river seems like the best Okay.
here.
Incredibly strong and aggressive play.
Very strong and aggressive play. Bad
turn over bed river here.
That's slow play. I elect to slow play.
Got in ace king here. And look what
happened.
We made a straight versus tunis. Poor
guy.
And this is going to be
a tough spot. I'm going to go for the
overbat.
He snap. Interesting. If he has a snap
call, I would have won check race. Okay,
so he had one of the few aces that he
could play this way.
We face a little dunk here. We got a
call. [ __ ] queens, guys. We are all in.
I seriously because queens are I lost
yesterday everything with queens. He
raised he no king or aces. We We're all
in, baby. We're all in. This is it. This
is a big moment of truth. This is it.
Either we win everything or we lose
everything. But we come on, baby. There
we go. Tense is a good hand for us.
No.
No. What the [ __ ] [ __ ]
Don't [ __ ] [ __ ]
I lost everything. Okay, our queen's
over here, but a little bit better. We
flipped against ace king. We're running
hot, guys. We're running hot. We
flipping hot. And here, I'm going to
jinx that. I'm going to stack the fish.
Oh, did we jinx it?
Yes, we jinxed it.
Nice, Michael. Nice jinx. Nice jinx.
Very nice jinx, sir. Very nice jinx.
Where are remaining coaches from?
Haven't heard their names on stars. Will
you show their results? It's megalodonic
aa for a living.
Tunis flu
3 to one. Let rip. And this is why we
trap, guys. This is why I trap. This is
why we trap him.
This is why we trap him. Four of hearts.
So, two of clubs. This is usually what
you go for, but I decided not to be too
obvious.
This is what they call a splendid
scenario.
Trapped him like a boss.
He's going to chicken out though. We're
going to have to play the chicken song.
See chicken song.
[Music]
He had queen 10 and he thought if I have
to bluff I have to go all in. That's too
much money. To be fair, he did have a
diamond. That's not good. So, he
probably decided that diamonds is not a
good hand to be bluffing with. Get a
call. 367.
Not uh the best board ever.
If it's one third
pocket knights.
I dislike my sizing there just big
again. Wacko, think about that after you
made the bet. Guy never learns.
Never learns.
Yo guys, we're going to get it all in
with queens.
No, we're not going to play the clip
again. He has ace king. So he's all in
with ace king. Where's the ace king
clip? Where is the ace king clip?
Let's go, baby girl. Here we go, baby
girl. Here we go.
Okay,
come on, [ __ ]
You had jacks. Oh my god. King
king king. Come on.
That [ __ ]
If he would only bring all this passion
and energy to the bedroom, I'm sure his
girlfriend would like it.
He calls.
Interesting turn.
If I had king of diamonds, I would not
bet. But I figured this one could bet.
But not 100% sure.
Not 100% sure about this hand
as a gem. It will be interesting.
When we hit, we do go in.
And strong fold. Strong fold for Mr.
Spew Monkey. Shout out to him.
Leaderboard complete. See where you are
on the leaderboard.
Where am I leaderboard? Poker stars.
