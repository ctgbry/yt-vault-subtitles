hi there boys and girls welcome back to
another episode of the mechanics of
poker podcast episode number three today
we will have a chat with mr jaredman
german is known for his super
educational play and explain videos on
youtube his channel helped me make sure
to go and check that out
he plays both live and online and i'm
really curious to hear more about his
journey through the ranks in poker he
mentioned it took him nine years to go
from starting to play poke to actually
beating 500 nil zoom i mean we everyone
knows 500 zoom is very hard to beat but
that's quite a long time so i'm very
curious sure a lot has happened over
those years
together with me adam and i'm sure you
share my curiosity for his journey
yeah i'm very excited for today's guest
under here about his journey to the high
stakes it seems like it took him a long
time to get out the micro stakes in
particular i think he says five years of
not beating the games so i'm gonna
really dig deep into what caused those
obstacles and i was over overcoming them
to become a high stakes player so yeah
really fascinated here how he's been
able to get himself to the high stakes
on the journey he's went on
yeah episode three now but it's starting
to become a trend it takes a while to
get to high stakes right
people want shortcuts but so far episode
number three at least five years is so
far my diagnosis for getting to high
stakes without further ado let's get
started chatting with mr jarrod
all right here we are hello mr jarrod
welcome to the podcast
thank you thank you it's good to be here
so i wanted to start this conversation
of pre-poker
as you mentioned some interesting stuff
in there that i think
might have had an impact on your poker
career as well i'm referring to the
competitive gaming and chess in your
teenage years
could you
elaborate a little bit more on those
times
yeah for sure so when i was a teen i
played a lot of video games but all the
video games i played they're always
excuse me they're always like
competitive video games uh not like they
were today though where you know there's
giant tournaments and competitions when
i played video games the only people
doing competitive video games were in
south korea like elky who played
starcraft
um
so yeah i played starcraft i played
world of warcraft arena
um
those are the only two i played
competitively but then i also played
some chess as a teenager i played chess
in chess club in high school and then
chess online i never got anything
to like a high level in either of those
things
um but they led me to poker i actually
found poker through video games
and everyone was very curious did you
kick elky's ass
no i never played elky i never got to a
level to even be competitive with elky
uh like the difference between someone
playing it for fun competitively online
and playing it professionally is like
the difference between like live one two
and playing 500 zoom like it's uh it's a
huge huge huge skill gap yeah what did
they have like what what makes an
excellent starcraft player what did the
asians and elky have that you didn't
so i don't know if you know much about
the competitive starcraft scene back in
the day but these people they would go
into gamer houses in south korea and
they would play 12 13 hours a day and
they would just practice against each
other and they would have something
called a high apm which is actions per
minute and they would be able to do like
300 to 400 actions per minute at the top
level and i was doing like 100 actions
per minute
so they they would just practice an
insane amount of time they would wow
yeah i have been like
yeah i have been elky okay okay tried
that right like a multi set like a world
guinness book
record for playing multiple tables at
the same time
yeah yeah something like that
um i don't know if he did anything
starcraft related but i think he tried
like a poker record right yeah so he
tried that for poker but i think those
that's probably a skill right for
especially in the beginning when you
have this mass multi-table you know
supernova elite that must have really
helped him
were there any any skills that you gain
from from playing starcraft and some
other games that you
brought with you when you started
playing poker
yeah i think i think gaining the the
computer and action skills do help for
online poker
um if you're playing a lot of tables uh
just the strategy aspect helped a lot i
think too just to get my mind into
like i don't know kind of focused on
strategy i was always interested in
strategy at least uh it didn't actually
work out for poker because for the first
six years i was playing recreationally
and losing but
i was always interested in the strategy
at least so it was mainly the the
strategic aspect that drew you towards
uh like starcraft chass
as well already from a young age
exactly yeah very competitive as well or
could you could you could you let it go
as well or were you very competitive
like if you would lose you would jump in
there right again
yeah exactly which was not good for
poker because if i lose that means i
have to go buy another 25 gift card from
7-eleven and put it on pokerstars
so this is how this is how it started
7-eleven this is how it started yeah
they did yeah they were your poker
career there was a five dollar fee on
the credit card too to to buy it at
7-eleven the prepaid credit card so i
was paying like 20 rake just to deposit
wow
no no no wonder no wonder yeah become a
winning player in the beginning yeah
exactly rake was just unbeatable the
rake was too high that's what i'm going
with and that's why that's why i didn't
win
rake was so high yeah then actually at
some point you mentioned that um
[Music]
you saw high stakes poker that was
probably in the time that you were still
playing playing video games and you're
like hey high sex poker that seems cool
right a bunch of guys big piles of cash
in front of them gambling it up
that seems like fun
any any favorite uh
favorite season or favorite character
well ivy and dwan were my favorite
um yeah i was playing i was playing wow
and one of my guild members they linked
me to high stakes poker
like a video of uh i think it was juan
bluffing someone like i think it was
bluffing
he's bluffing howard lederer with the
six eight off-suit when he like five bet
pre-flop and then they checked it down
he hit a pair and i was like yeah i
wanna do that
but that also didn't help
okay
so double so so tom juan was a
you could say inspiration for your poker
career when i started absolutely yeah
and what what was it about him compared
to the other tables for example i liked
semi farah
you know that was definitely my favorite
character on poker what was about one
i liked uh so i watched maybe the whole
season and a lot of the players they
would just bad they would play they
would play their good hands but dwan
would just go for it you know he would
he would be one of the few people who
were going for like these insane bluffs
and that's what really drew me to poker
is like going for the
insanity he would really try to i don't
know like own people
um but you know in retrospect maybe he
wasn't doing the most
the most optimal things but
it was a really entertaining poker to
watch
it was at least already it opened up
your mind for the possibilities right i
remember i think i
heard a podcast with gelfont where he
said that he got in touch with juan and
that
i think the conversation was something
about the hat top pair and galvin was
considered okay do we call her do a
fault and then juan was like let's turn
it into a bluff and he's like yeah yeah
[ __ ] you know like out of the box place
do you remember that one hand he played
where he had queen
he had queen 10 do you remember that
hand
like it was like deus deus 10
and he got aces and a deuce to fold it
was like eight ways pre-flop
yeah yeah yeah it was with the the guy
who won the world series right yeah
peter um something was all very very
greenstein i forget his last name peter
uh yes
anyways yeah he folded the deuce yeah he
skated thank you yeah
yeah that was that was my favorite hand
on high sticks poker
yeah that hand was insane now that you
mentioned i i suddenly get a flashback
yeah basically using your top pair as a
as a as
yeah basically as a boat blocker right
yeah and i remember eastgate was in a
very tough spot because it was like a
limp butter or something right eight way
indeed
yeah it was it was an eight-way called
pot pre-flop i don't remember if it was
limped or i think barry raised with aces
under the gun and got seven callers
and then he c bet like half pot or
something and duane raised eastgate cold
called barry called
turn was a brick and then
eastgate checked barry check and juan
just barreled again and they both folded
it was just insanity wow yeah
so i can imagine that when you see that
you know your mind indeed really opens
up like wow yeah you know
what is what is possible in this game
right if you if you if you're willing to
look for it
yeah
so you know i was trying to motivate you
up until today
yeah yeah i mean
that that whole aspect of playing the
game like that it never quite goes away
when that's where you when that's where
you start in poker but you know trying
that at five cent ten cent
and losing stacks left and right didn't
actually work out for me surprisingly
but
uh it was inspiration yeah sure
what was it about poker compared to like
this because i assume at some point you
know you started playing less chess less
starcraft and more poker what was about
poker that
drew you to the game compared to these
other games
uh in all honesty it was probably the
money because there was no money in
professional starcraft when i played and
there's not really any money in chess
either and
you know you need money but it was maybe
the the act of playing cards was
something cool like something romantic
about the act of playing cards to win
money because i'd always played cards
you know with my grandparents with my
parents you know we'd play whatever
euchre or something like that and just
the idea that you could make a living by
just playing cards was kind of
amazing
yeah i can i can strongly relate to that
but still it was mainly the strategic
aspect and then let's become the new
thomped one exactly that was really the
motivation right nothing that that
wasn't you can make good money so let's
play it for that
can you relate to that adam
yeah 100 percent i can relate to
watching those cm high stakes games with
duan and ivy and being blown away and
also super inspired by tom duan's ballsy
bluffs uh hundreds of thousands um and
yeah definitely inspired my kind of
trajectory newer the online world as
well and figuring out wait a second what
is going on with this card game and how
is it possible to make money in in this
game as well so yeah definitely opened
my eyes to the game in a similar way
yeah so jared i'd like to take it back
to uh the start of your career so we've
got this kind of framework of a
competitive guy playing chess starcraft
and you almost stumbled in the pocket or
you found poker at some point with this
competitive drive it sounds like you
went into the micro games and perhaps
played there for a long time you
actually did play the mic mistakes for a
long time see i would like you to talk
about that yeah yeah getting started in
pocket and how the first few years went
for you
yeah sure so um i started playing online
poker when i was 16. um i mean 18 poker
stars 18. and uh
um
18. yeah i started when i was 18. and i
i would deposit 25 at a time i would
play like uh those 20 i don't know if
you remember but there was 25 cent 25
man
uh turbo tournaments that had no rake
they were on poker stars a long time ago
or something and i remember dwan said
something about how he started at like
25 cent uh tournament so whatever i
would play those i would bust i would
bust
um eventually i would run it up to like
50 and i would go buy into
to 25 cent 50 cent and then bust that
and then it was just a it was just kind
of like a hobby where i was
trying
like a hobby where i was trying to take
it seriously but i didn't have the money
or the skill set to actually succeed um
i didn't start actually studying poker
and learning good strategy until maybe
like six years after that so
it was a long time of me you know either
going to the casino and playing one two
and you know dusting off my paycheck or
like you know playing online and
yeah a lot a lot a lot of me playing it
recreationally kind of wanting to be
better but not actually applying myself
and studying and learning good skills to
make me good at the game
yeah wow so five six years of that kind
of recreational living so how would you
support yourself at that time what was
your job with occupation then uh between
going to school and working i had i was
a bartender for about four years and
then when i finished school
um
in it i got an it job at a steel factory
yeah nice so when you were trying to
figure out poker what was your
first five years like how are you trying
to uh get better at the game was it just
trying to get experience how are you
trying to get yourself to be a winning
player in those
times uh by by playing more hands that's
what i was trying to do i would uh if it
wasn't working you know i would just
play more hands and then uh and lose and
that's about it i would talk with you
know people when i play live poker you
talk with people and talk strategy and
everything but
the real answer is i wasn't doing much
to improve like to get better um
nothing useful anyways
yeah so you are combining playing micro
stakes online with one two and two five
live the first four five years
yeah
yeah exactly i think i was a little uh
i was too like i was too cocky when i
was when i was growing up with poker and
like you think that what you ever the
little amount that you've learned is
enough to beat the game and you just
attribute it to you know it's bad
variance it's bad variance it'll turn
around it'll turn around and that was a
long time for me it was way too long it
was mainly just being too cocky i think
yeah during that time did you still keep
the optimism and the hope of potentially
being a winning player was the dream
still strong during those years
yeah
yeah it was it was a long it was a long
stretch but the dream's always still
alive when you're playing a
gambling game i guess because you can
always uh you can always blame something
else other than yourself when you're
playing a gambling game
yeah so what was the obstacle you were
running into obviously your strategy
maybe wasn't as good as it could be what
was the obstacle you found yourself
continually to a five-year period what
was stopping you from build a bit of a
bankroll getting a bit of a win rate
what was holding you back then
uh making like one tom dwan punt every
200 hands maybe
and not even like in a a good way like
you know
just a horrible horrible pun like i
don't know i'd be playing live one two
and some guy with three bet me and i'd
have i opened the bun with like ace five
off or something i'm like i don't
believe him i'm gonna raise him and then
he goes all in and i'm like well i have
an ace so i have the right price and
maybe he has kings like maybe we can hit
the ace
you know once one of those every eight
hours adds up
yeah overly aggressive trying to uh play
like the high stakes guys and the the
laws yes yeah yeah
so when did it start to turn around um
so it started turning around when
um
so five years yeah when i was about 23 i
guess it started turning around 23 22
maybe maybe a little bit later but i
read
applications of no limit hold'em by
matthew janda and it kind of introduced
me to a lot of concept that i had never
even thought about before
and then i read his second book which
was no limit hold him for advanced
players and that completely changed the
way that i um
that i thought about poker it just
completely revolutionized every thought
i ever had about poker and since then
i've approached it in a completely
different way oh wow
that was like a turning point
i don't i don't get any kickbacks from
the books but uh yeah what were some of
the changes that went into your game
around that time so you started reading
these books application of poker and
when did it how did that impact your
game in the short term when you're
playing these microsdx games so in the
short term
good pre-flop ranges as well as more
solid post-flop strategies
had a direct impact
i think the main
the main thing that changed is it
changed my mindset on poker rather than
you know trying to
win i was trying to play a good strategy
that was the main thing that kind of
just i stopped i stopped spewing as much
because it's just like a different
approach to the game
yeah it's almost like you started to see
the
hidden pieces and the actual strategy
game that was being that's going on the
whole time rather than trying to over
aggress players you saw the bigger
picture exactly yeah so renee i think
it's a good time for you to dive in and
ask some questions on some of the
strategies that jared was able to pick
up during that time after doing a full
almost like a full um shift of mindset
and approaches during this this period
yeah it really sounded like he went from
uh
the jedi mind reader trying to figure
out how to beat everyone to more be like
hey if i play solid they make mistakes
so i make money right i don't have to
look everyone up and it was funny that
you actually said right you can
rationalize anything out of five years
i've been in a downswing for five years
right and especially as you mentioned
you were a bit cocky
uh maybe like
the the overconfidence from the gaming
put in the uh put into the poker tables
right you already felt comfortable i
think it's called the halo effect right
adam if i'm not mistaken so i want to i
want to highlight something that you
said which was
you weren't applying yourself to the
game
um
then you bought bought shout out to mr
matu match jenna
turn around i'm sure he will get a big a
big seals now suddenly like a spike and
feels like what the hell happened oh
wait jared man uh
recommended me to everyone who's
listening right
now the books are my solution
so how does applying yourself to poker
look like after you've read the books to
before you've read the books
so before i read the books applying
myself was trying to play more hands
more hours than just trying to win and
beat people just by like you said using
jedi mind tricks
and then applying myself afterwards was
i actually started studying off table a
lot
i started studying a lot more than i
played
um maybe like 80 studying 20 playing
maybe even a higher ratio than that
and
yeah so it was it was just a lot of off
table studying um i bought a few more
books i uh looked at online resources
instead of depositing 50 online i would
spend 50 on a course or something like
that and i would just do a lot of
studying so you're actually going from
spending to investing
exactly
because i like it
yeah
definitely better than my other strategy
because whereas before i was
obsessed with playing and trying to beat
people
now i was i was obsessed with learning
whatever the best strategy is
interesting
yeah you
i can imagine that also gives you a
certain peace right
that you don't have to force the action
and that but but i understand there's a
bit of a conflict right you wanted to
become like tom dwan and in the same
time this book tells you hey don't do
anything crazy
there's still lots of crazy stuff though
that's that's the best part is that you
got to do crazy stuff it's just you have
to do it in a good way you know like bet
bet all in for 7x pod is pretty crazy
but it's uh
that's in the book yeah that's
interesting because i can relate to that
as well where you go through phases of
indeed inspiration and that inspiration
in this case due to tom one can
sometimes become a bit too spewy and
then you kind of try to recalibrate but
then you play a bit too too safe sort of
and you're constantly calibrating and
trying to find like that sweet spot and
yeah that that just takes time right
yeah exactly that's that's what you
should be doing in poker usually is that
you know you learn a new concept you try
to apply it you over apply you bring it
back you realize that you should apply
it
was just doing a little bit too extreme
and from there basically
you started winning
i started winning in the live games that
i played yeah um
i was i stopped playing online basically
unless it was just you know to practice
and i was playing live two five and i
just went on a pretty big heater
um until eventually i reached live 510
and i started making more money than my
job um
and yeah i kind of never looked back
after that so it was basically just sort
of a natural transition you looked at
your paycheck in your job then you
looked at your paycheck from from the
casino and it's like yeah
one is definitely making me more money
than the other so again in retrospect i
was running insane
and it wasn't an accurate representation
of what you could expect to win like
playing live 2-5 or live 510 but i think
i put in maybe 800 hours in the year and
that was more than my yearly paycheck
nice hourly
that was god running for sure
you were like okay this this whole pro
poker thing seems quite cool right given
the fact how you ran so you quit your
job you start to play
play live poker i guess them for olivia
yeah playing live poker for a living
yeah and then
i i guess at some point you had a little
bit of a reality check the the cocky the
cocky jared
realized that oh wait
maybe i wasn't a little bit of a heater
yeah so i i immediately because you know
this is just how life goes you know i
quit my job and immediately i ran like
horrible
um
but yeah i rebounded like eventually i
ended up you know getting it back but
you always get that reality check after
you do something like that i feel
um
at the time when i quit my job i wasn't
uh i wasn't nearly as cocky i don't
think i was i was cocky i was kind of
more
realistic about poker but i wasn't
realistic about win rates that's for
sure like when your first 800 hours
where you start applying yourself you
just run insane you think that that's
going to continue forever and then and
then it just never does
yeah it's it's maybe not even think it's
more uh
it's it's the ego who likes that reality
of being a crusher so why exactly why
would you prefer that beautiful the
beautiful world with with reality who
likes that
yeah and then you and then you end up
entitled to that you think and then if
you don't run as good as that you think
that that's what you deserve when in
reality you were just at like the peak
of a really good run good and the
reality is much lower but if you're if
you only see the peak and like 800 hours
in a year for live poker it's it's like
no hands but it's a long time like time
wise so you think like oh yeah i played
a year that's a huge sample
it's always going to be like this did
you notice a difference when you
completely quit your job
and only focused on poker like so yeah
it's like maybe you play poker when you
not like it and i was like yeah i have
to go and play
um yeah it took a little bit of time um
but yeah it starts to become more of a
grind for sure
it also becomes a lot more stressful
that's that's the main thing i noticed
like i still really enjoyed the act of
playing
and studying
uh at the time
but the stress was
immense compared to when i had a job
the stress in terms of the pressure that
you actually had to make money exactly
exactly it was i didn't have any other
um other income streams at the time
so it was just poker and that's that's
never a situation you really want to be
in in my opinion if i could go back i i
would find a way to not have poker be my
only source of income at least the act
of playing poker yeah i think i think if
you start out turning completely pro for
a living too fast is indeed very
stressful and if i if i look at
in my in the people that i've coached
usually if people didn't make it there
was some sort of financial pressure
involved which i think if you have
financial pressure it's very hard to be
process oriented right because you need
to win so you become more result
oriented so the bad beats hurt you
actually more right it's very
you will tilt way easier
i agree yeah
you'll tilt way easier you're more
likely to spew off whatever remaining
bankroll you have more likely to tilt
shot higher i think
so i was actually now going to say what
were a couple of these
these distilled distilled issues that
came up for you but i heard one you you
shot take higher trying to win your
money back yeah oh yeah definitely like
um not even just shouting higher
um when i when i lost it's just like if
i had a thousand dollars i'd play five
ten if i had two hundred dollars i'd
play one two
and that's just what i would do
and eventually
once i started studying and you know you
have a good run
eventually you just stay there but it's
not a good bankroll strategy that's for
sure but yeah there is there's like i
think you should find the sweet spot
right
have some sort of balance and then shot
taking does have a good compound effect
if the shots do sure do take off for
sure yeah you have to make sure maybe
indeed with a little bit of income on
the side
yeah yeah i always had a job so if if i
lost my my poker money it didn't matter
you know i had a i had a paycheck that
paid for all my bills but it was still
like maybe i could have stayed longer
you know at live t5 or playing micro
sticks to improve
i remember at our at our cfp we normally
we only took in
uh guys already professionals but we had
a friend of a friend
and he was very enthusiastic blah blah
so we decided to give him a shot but he
was still working i think four days a
week and he said i'll work three days a
week now and spend all of my time the
rest of my time on poker so we're like
okay give it a try and then slowly
throughout the process he went from
working three days to two days to one
day to quitting his job right a very
national trend transition and i it looks
like in hindsight maybe you would have
liked to do the same right bartender job
four days a week three days a week two
days a week one day a week
yeah
i mean if i could go back i do a lot of
things uh differently when it comes to
poker but
i think um
yeah better a better approach to poker
and bankroll and poker money management
would have helped me a lot
so you were still playing live back in
the time when did you decide to
transition into online poker and why did
you decide to do that
yeah i didn't decide to do that kovid uh
covet happens
cove it happened oh wait i was gonna i
was thinking you were to say black
friday happened but we are way further
ahead yeah black friday was the opposite
ah
interesting so just for my just from my
time perspective you know where we are
now so basically covet happened and
you were like okay well then i guess
i'll play online poker instead yeah
yeah i was um i was playing online poker
like maybe you know 100 100 zoom 200
zoom just to practice
uh before kovid but then when covet
happened i was like okay i guess i got
to take this online poker thing
seriously and yeah i did i did more
studying after covid than i've ever done
in my entire life
um but before kovid i was just playing
live poker so we had like um we had a
quarter 50 game that ran like three or
four days a week for a long time
and it was it was great and then covet
happened and the game stopped just
before kovid anyways it was starting to
slow down and then there was no 510
there was no
you know no life poker at all unless you
wanted to play into underground games
which i didn't want to play so
oh interesting um we've you you
mentioned you would play like some
hundred some 200 zoom just to practice
yeah would you then
if you would then go back to your live
game which was way higher
in terms of
level difference
is it comparable like the 200 zoom games
to your your your quarter two to twenty
five fifty game
it's comparable in the sense that the
twenty five fifty game was much much
easier
like uh it's not even close
you would actually pick up
like basically the two nintendo zoom
racks would put you in spots oh yeah
where
you could actually develop so you
basically went there to increase sort of
the necessity to develop your game and
you can pick some moves and apply that
in your 2550
live game and you would basically become
a very big crusher yeah i wouldn't say i
was a huge crusher back then but i was
beating the game
and um 200 zoom helped me help me learn
a lot like just practicing like of
trying to apply what i learned um when
studying was a lot easier to apply
playing 200 zoom than it was to play
live 2550 if that's if that's what
you're getting at a lot easier yeah
especially if you're very into into gto
a lot of spots are heads up oh let's
play about the first big blind and then
you're in a eight-handed full-ring game
where people are limping you isolating
four-way pots all the time yeah you're
like ah i want that i want that button
versus big mind spot where i studied the
a73 exactly exactly and then you get
like 20 hands an hour live so
it's tough to it's tough to get some
practice
yeah it's it's it's a it's a completely
uh different game
adam
do you have any any any questions on
this part before he uh
before i guess he turned pro online
after yeah i'd like to talk about that
transition from playing live to playing
online because as you've talked about
like say the 200 zoom pools probably
tougher than the 2550 live games and for
a lot of players that's quite a daunting
thing to come to the lower stakes online
games you've got to drop your ego you've
got to start learning these hard online
games at lower stakes so yeah i talk
about your mindset during that time so
corbin strikes live games are off and
now you're on the online felt talk
through that transition how you approach
it from a mindset perspective so from a
mindset perspective my mindset was that
i'm going to study like an insane amount
i'm just going to put in like
a stupid amount of of study work um
at the time i was
watching again i'm gonna shout out
someone but i was watching um my name is
carl freedmulders
um so i watched all of his videos
which was a lot i was like 60 hours or
more or something like that and then i i
would go into piyosolver and i would run
all the spots that he did to verify it
myself and then i would
um
take hand examples of hands that i
played at 200 zoom and then of that spot
and i would review my hands and then
compare it to the spot
um
see i just did i did my mindset was i'm
gonna go in this and i'm just gonna
study an insane amount like if these
guys can beat it i can beat it and how
many hours of study and were you putting
in before you started to see some a good
win rate in the games you were playing
uh so 500 zoom it took me a while
um 200 zoom i was already technically
beating but that got a very small sample
just from like my practice hands um
maybe like 250 to 500 hours after
studying was when i really started to
see results i would say like
from from the point of covid
i would say maybe like yeah 250 hours of
studying and i was putting in like maybe
30 hours of studying a week so whatever
that is and what were some of the
biggest challenges you faced when you
went into the the online games both from
like a kind of eagle perspective and
playing a lot lower but also from a
strategy perspective and having to play
these tough games what were some of the
early obstacles you ran into
um some of the early obstacles i ran
into is
for better or worse my approach was to
simplify as much as possible
um so that was me basically just betting
one-third of like every flop um
a lot of just like one sizes everywhere
a lot of just like not thinking about
the spot a lot of just trying to apply
heuristics about the spot that i would
learn from like watching a video or or
looking at a spreadsheet or something
like that so my biggest obstacle was the
level of play seriously like it was just
a very very high level of play from what
i was used to
and
i can't think of anything specific other
than it was just i was getting put in
infinitely more tough spots than like
when you play a live game
just a lot harder decisions a lot
tougher spots
yeah so you've transitioned from the
highest stakes live games to the kind of
200 500 online games and you've noticed
the level of players a lot higher
yeah it seems like you were not daunted
by that in any way if anything you're
almost like inspired to
outwork everyone outstudy everyone where
does that come from what is that
approach to what these games are tough
but i'm gonna figure out and beat them
yeah it was kind of out of necessity
because um
for better or worse the the 500 zoom and
the zoom games on stars are really hyped
up as being really tough so if i'm gonna
play a game that's really tough if if
i'm realistic about myself if i need to
beat it i need to play better than the
people in there and the only way to play
better than them is to outwork them
other than your approach to studying is
there anything else you did during that
time to
improve your game and your approach to
polka yeah studying with other poker
players is is good you know you could
get some feedback um
get it's always good to have different
views on on things and so you're not
just stuck in your own head and your own
approach um i watched yeah i watched a
lot of a lot of videos a lot of courses
um
yeah nothing else specific i would say
yeah was there any point where you
thought that the mountain might be too
big or that you won't be when it could
be able to beat the games online or the
500 zoom pool for example
uh
just just like every day i would say
maybe not like maybe not every hour or
so but yeah so how do you keep yourself
motivated to keep pursuing to keep
leveling up your game when you're facing
obstacles like that it's tough uh i
would
say well again i was kind of forced to
because you know like i said i had quit
my job and now it's like you kind of
have to so it's a little bit out of
necessity
but i also just loved the strategy um
i loved studying i loved looking and
learning new things and applying them
and
and yeah if i didn't love the strategy
of poker so much i don't think i would
have been able to do it so it seems like
the necessity of do i die mentality and
also the love of learning and strategy
and improving your strategy seemed to
spur you on and for some reason you just
kept that ambition that motivational
drive to uh overcome whatever obstacle
was in front of you and to beat the
games so renee you might want to dive in
here in terms of asking how he was able
to uh go from that transition to being a
really good live player to beating these
very hard five-minute zoom pools and
what some of the things he had to do to
achieve that
yeah i also think it really helps right
you went from 2550
to 200 nl so yeah like money-wise first
of all you probably had you weren't like
in the past
uh you didn't have to beat the 200 zoom
games in order to make a living right so
yeah this helps you to really have that
view on like oh i love this oh more
obstacles oh yeah come on make it very
tough because you don't give a [ __ ]
about if you have a win rate right now
or not right yeah yeah yeah i i had an
ample bank roll for 500 zoom and 200
zoom yeah and
man playing playing underworld has a
very big impact on how you perform uh
and i guess overall always better from
from that perspective
uh and especially this is this is how
you can actually apply that love we had
an uh i remember the first first podcast
that was i think with yours as well
right he was talking about how difficult
tournaments for example are compared to
cash games and how if you're already in
a spot where you're financially sort of
free you can actually enjoy the
difficulties that come along your road
or along your road right because it's
like oh cool i'm being challenged
whereas if you need the money you're
like why does it have to be so hard i
just want to make money i need to pay my
bills
yeah it's like why do i why do i have to
lose this flip here yeah exactly right
outcome oriented due to financial
pressure so if people want to get a main
takeaway from this podcast
try to not get into financial
difficulties because after that it's
very hard to grind your way out of
poverty there you go people problem
solved just have more money so just like
it was interesting just like matthew
jenner had a very big impact on your
poker career right how he thought about
poker uh now you mentioned uh shout out
to mr mr fleet miller my name is carl um
do you remember some of the some of the
eye-opening concepts that in those 60
hours of video
that you watched of him that were like
oh wow and were there a couple of
conflicting points with what matthew
would say and what mr carl would say so
i learned over betting and like betting
range small from from mr matthew janda
but then
he didn't go into like it's all you can
only put so many so much information
into a 300 page book so from
from uh my name is carl i learned more
of specifics on spots uh some of the
more eye opening things
were
the strategies in three bet pots
compared to how i was playing them um
just things like you know being able to
to lead lead in the cutoff after
you call the three bet from the button
because you know some boards favor your
range so much as even as a as a preflop
caller that you can you can lead
that was one that was kind of
eye-opening not specifically because it
would change my strategy a lot but
because it changed the way i thought
about
how ranges interacted on boards
um and then the
a lot of it was specifics to do with
spots like
um being able to you know range bet on
certain textures which bet sizes are
good on certain textures and why
um how how the solver actually thinks
about barreling hands on the turn uh
that was one of the that was one of the
main things i would say actually yeah
barreling on turn following through on
rivers because i was choosing the wrong
hand classes a lot of the time
you were uh strictly equity driven
yeah exactly yeah that's uh i remember a
friend of mine used to tag people equity
barrelers you would call that yeah okay
and then you had a certain class but
this is how we were taught right we were
conditioned all the way in the beginning
from hey equity is good then when you
get called at least you know you have
some chances to improve so it becomes
quite natural i'm not bluffing i'm semi
bluffing that's what people used to say
right exactly is that my perfect
assembly blocking fuse easier than than
just cold stone bluffing yeah exactly
you're kind of like i'm not bluffing i'm
just semi bluffing it's fine and it's
funny that you mentioned that like uh
i'm very glad to hear it does good to my
heart that i hear you uh you like the
donkey donkey on the uh
on some boards but indeed it's not
necessarily that it's
that frequent even though if you start
playing with solvers i mean you can make
dunk arguments on every street almost in
every situation but it's indeed more
like the eye-opening thing right you
were used to again conditioned probably
in the past to you check towards the
razor yeah now you kind of understood
the concept behind it oh no we check
towards the razor because usually the
razer has the equity advantage whereas
on certain boards that's not the case oh
wow so then we actually don't check to
the razor so it's a it's a revolutionary
concept right yeah you start to
look at poker completely different and
you kind of give your brain that
information like hey brain go look for
spots where that's the case yeah and
poker starts to become
a lot more enjoying and like
specifically regarding that i would
start thinking rather of like oh instead
of checking to the razor like you
mentioned which is exactly what i was
taught it's more of
who does this favor and why and we
always have an option to bet and like
the only reason that a ra like a
pre-flop aggressor might want to bet
when they're at a position is because
the board favors them and that goes
reverse as well where there's a lot of
spots where let's say you open the small
blind get called by the big blind you
want to check range now on some low
boards so that was that was
revolutionary in the concept where i
stopped thinking in terms of who the
pre-flop aggressor is just start
thinking in terms of who does this board
favor and why why are we betting we're
not betting just because we raised
pre-flop
boom mind opening stuff i can i i can
imagine i remember at the
similar
yeah similar epiphanies throughout those
time
that indeed like when you start to
understand why behind certain strategies
you went from mainly betting one third
and probably actually
sometimes
force you in some tough spots later on
right and then you suddenly understood
like hey wait if i start to bet bigger i
actually achieve this with my sizing oh
wait now i don't get in that trouble
spot anymore sure yeah and like i was
have like i said when i first started
playing i was heavily simplifying and
not necessarily for a good reason but
um i knew how to play that strategy
but then the more the more that you
learn the more the concepts that you
learn you understand again why you're
doing things and once you understand why
then it then it becomes a lot easier it
just takes
infinitely longer to understand why than
to just do something
yeah and when you understand why you
also understand why not yeah exactly
it's not easy to understand why so it's
like for example i'm not necessarily
against simplified strategies but what
simplified strategies often do if you do
it for the sake of simplifying basically
you stop to think
right it's like yes of course i have my
default play standard quote quote lines
but there's always going to be a couple
of hands that don't want to take the
standard line right it's like ah usually
i do this but with this hand though or
versus this player or on this on this
particular texture
i probably am not going to accomplish
the same as what i would normally
accomplish in my baseline strategy but
with this hand i would like to go a bit
bigger or actually usually i check range
but this specific hand maybe i'll bet
right i like that you use the word
accomplish because i use that a lot in
my own thinking um what does my hand
achieve like what does my hand
accomplish when it bets like what
happens when i bet this hand to his
range what types of hands does he fold
what types of hands does he raise what
types of ants does he call when you
start thinking like that of like well
how does my hand perform as a bet
compared to perform as a check compared
to perform as an over bet uh that really
helped me that that was another type of
epiphany for me yeah i think asking
yourself the right questions i remember
when i do
uh hand this reviews to students it
always comes down to like okay buddy
let's let's go back to the basics what
are you trying to achieve with your hand
yeah
and out of that like a solver right the
solver is trying to achieve something
yeah right it's trying to achieve a
certain outcome then it's up to you to
figure that out like okay
he tries to you know he has certain
certain equity and he he chooses the
highest ev strategy and it's up to us to
figure out okay why is this so high ev
that's um
yeah i agree 100
and
some people i'll talk to some people
about whatever poker theory or solvers
and you'll look at an output from a
solver and you'll be like well that's
just like the solver being a solver and
i'm like no like there's a there's a
reason for there's a reason why it's
betting king jack with the king of
spades 75 of the time and betting king
jack without the spade 25 of the time
like there's a reason it's not always
human knowable like you can't always
think of yourself like oh i'm gonna know
this very intricate weird blocker effect
on the river but there are there's
always a reason
yeah and it doesn't it doesn't
necessarily mean that you either have
the opposite camp which is like okay it
does that's how i have to do that as
well randomize randomized randomized but
if you like you have to kind of find the
sweet spot in the middle and be like um
is this actually a returning thing let
me check hey it's actually a returning
thing okay i don't understand this why
right because sometimes indeed when
people say solver is going to be a
solver you have some random stuff in the
solver sometimes that sure goes against
what you thought was true but it happens
one in 20 textures and then you're like
yeah okay probably has something to do
with a specific range or
yeah like we we cannot we cannot do
exactly everything perfect yeah it's not
always human achievable but there is
always a reason why it's doing it and
it's not i should i should i should
change that it's not always worth
implementing or trying to implement in
your game and it's not always practical
to
think that you could
replicate that in like a real game um
but there's a reason why i did the
solver thing because it it always has a
reason because it's just
it's just a solution
yeah and i think you still have to be
curious for those because maybe
you'll learn something that has nothing
to do with that exact hand in that spot
should you learn something in a
different spot right yeah i was i was
looking at a river spot recently where
we would bluff like every hand on the
river on the run out except we wouldn't
bluff like uh king nine with the nine of
hearts it was like a big blind versus
small blind three bet pot and it was
because on the turn the solver would
call only the pocket nines with the nine
of hearts and it wasn't like intuitive
why so on the river you know it would
have more folds with the nine of hearts
but it was like a slight small
difference and it was like that was the
only reason i could see and that stuff
like that's not practical and it's not
worth you know trying to implement but
then you have more overarching things
like not barreling the turn with the
flop backdoor flush draw um that was
another revolutionary concept for me
just like simple blocking effects
um
they have big impacts on your game yeah
exactly right you have to understand
not that king nine is a give up but why
is king ninety give up right and then we
go back to the turn you said okay he
exactly calls uh the nine of hearts so
we're not blocking the calls but we're
actually blocking the falls on the river
that's why we don't want to bluff the
nine of hearts exactly it's still up to
you to decide okay this is a broader
concept
and apparently i have to ask myself on
the river am i blocking his folding
range exactly
yes i should be less inclined to bluff
right that's kind of what you
try to take from that's the exactly
exactly that's like the overarching
thing that you should try to learn from
that spot um the spot specifically was
tough because it was calling like all
the pocket nines but it was just calling
the ones with nine of hearts like 10
more which is a big impact in a range
that has mostly pocket nines by the
river
yeah and that's a concept that whatever
board you take whatever situation most
probably that situation will apply does
that mean you actually have to go to the
river in a solver and copy what it does
no you have no
think okay am i indeed blocking the
falling range that's usually not a great
idea because statistically people hold
less right yeah it's just
written in stone yeah exactly but then
again we might be against a player who
folds who overfalls right and then we
might suddenly want to bluff it again
because he's still folding even though
we have the worst blocker we might still
want to bluff because he's overfolding
right sure so that's why it's never a
concrete answer
absolutely um yeah if you want to get
into exploitative play like it gets even
way more complicated like way way way
more complicated of course do you like
to get into the exploitative
exploitative territories or are you like
uh more
i had been a bit beat on the the
previous episode who was more like nah
i'll stay i'll stay in my own range try
to be as solid as possible let them make
mistakes and not get into the into the
leveling wars
so i've talked to ben about this um a
bit
uh we're on the same page basically in
my approach
to the way that i play poker is very
similar to his where i just try to play
solid i focus on my own strategies um i
try my best to play at whatever i think
the equilibrium would be
um there are like i have such a big
sample
at 500 zoom now that there are some
players without going into some detail
that i do do a few things that aren't
technically allowed but it's very few
and far between and another reason for
that is that
um
you know i to in order to have like the
highest win rate at 500 zoom i think you
need to exploit you need to dig deep
into what your opponents are doing what
the tendencies are what the pool
tendencies are
you're just not going to achieve a very
high win rate unless you do that i think
um but that was never my goal like i
wanted to move up on online poker as
well
so i just focused on trying to get
better because you know learning how to
exploit a guy at 500 zoom doesn't help
you move up to 2k and l
yeah this is this is a very interesting
point like
knowing your long-term goal right and
trying to
do the right things that will get to go
get get to that goal faster maybe
focusing on exploiting that guy fully on
500 zoom would give you a higher ring
rate at that moment but your goal is not
to have a highest win rate at five no
zoom you want exactly reach high stakes
as soon as possible
you might sort of you know
play less less ev at that exact moment
to have higher ev in the future because
you will move up faster exactly yeah
and i always went to that mindset with
online because my mindset for online was
always i'm going to play online to
improve so when i play my bigger games
you know i have a better strategy
then it kind of changed because of kovid
but now life poker is back so not in
canada unfortunately but you know i can
travel to the states and play live poker
um so yeah my goal was never to have the
highest win rate at 500 zoom exactly you
just use it as a
as a station in between
yeah because it's it's very tough
there's a lot of good players and like
the rake is very high i think the rake
is 3b per 100 over my sample so it's a
tough game
um
yeah like even if even if you're playing
against regs who you you think whether
it's true or not but if you think you're
better than them it's tough to beat them
for a lot of bb per 100 unless you're
actively exploiting them which again i
wasn't doing yeah this is also the thing
right people sometimes get a bit
obsessed about i want to beat 500 and
i'll zoom and i mean if that is your
ultimate goal right yeah if you reach
that you feel very satisfied that i only
do it but sometimes i have people they
only play 500 zoom and then afterwards
they complain about low rim rating that
they're not making enough money i'm like
okay yeah
pick a goal here right there's there's
2k or 5k games out there that are way
softer than the games that you're
playing
so then at some point also you know i
think
in poker you can improve in many many
many forms i mean adam is here he helps
players on their mental game on their
performance which will have a big impact
on your winnings as well but the same is
like yeah certain game selection right
maybe you should try to find different
games in the 500 zumpu if you're not
happy with your winnings right if you're
just doing it as you said for the
competitive aspect trying to get better
and you know it's it's very convenient
right i mean i also like zoom you sit
down you start at the tables that's all
you have to worry about yeah i
personally play on like foresight so i'm
constantly lobbies closing opening
tables i have to divide my attention but
what i get in return is better games
or higher money yep that's true like if
you're willing to specifically for
online but in live game live games as
well like the per the player who's more
versatile and more willing to try
different games or
play different areas is going to make
more money long term i think the other
thing with zoom is i know you stream and
i think zoom is a much better format for
streaming because you don't have to
close tables and reopen tables and it's
so much easier to stream when you're
playing zoom you just put up the tables
and go
like unless the pool breaks you're you
just play you don't have to worry about
closing and reopening tables but yeah i
mean you know you only have a limited
amount of attention
yeah yeah more tasks you're better we
will run out faster it's as simple as
that
yeah i think that in terms of raw money
playing 500 zoom as you're like only
game would be a financial mistake for
sure like because if you can beat 500
zoom you can beat some of these 1k
2k like you know
2k nl knl you can probably beat some of
those games so just table select those
while you have a few tables of 500 zoom
it's gonna make you a lot more money
than just i play 500 zoom that's all i
play this is what i want to do um unless
that's your goal unless unless that's
something you want to do for the
competitive side i guess i'm not quite
sure
maybe you want to be the best 500 zoom
player so that was like your only point
of improvement for mr call carl
sure mr carl i remember he only played
500 zoom um
i mean he did occasionally play normal
tables but yeah
yeah definitely but maybe his goal
wasn't wasn't strictly financial again
yeah no exactly right you have to figure
out what your goal is and take actions
that are in line with those goals if
after you think
you reach what you wanted to reach and
you're like oh i'm not happy then
apparently you did something wrong
this podcast is brought to you by poker
ambition where me and adam have created
our coaching program the mechanics of
poker after having reached high sex
poker ourselves we tested out this
philosophy on our cfp students which saw
them rise through the ranks and doubled
their win rate we then took the best
knowledge of that cfp program and turn
it into the mechanics of poker so you
can have that high quality content
without the long term commitment and
often hefty price that comes with a cfp
program now i will be teaching you the
technical side of how poker really works
how to think about the game and how to
consistently get better and adam focuses
on the mindset and performance skills
you need to know in order to convert all
that technical poker knowledge into more
consistent profits at the table now this
program is high level it's made for
professional poker players who have the
ambition to break free from mid stakes
and move up to high stakes poker so if
you're ambitious about your poker goals
go over to pokerambition.com
for more information and there you can
also find a free one-hour demo of
everything that is inside the program if
you have any further questions don't
hesitate to reach out but without
further ado let's get back to more
goodness in this episode
yeah i'm interested to know where your
mindsets are right now in terms of
what's your next direction so you went
from obviously playing live very
successfully covered forced you online
you've been very successful there and
now the live games in america in
particular are starting to reopen where
are your
where are you getting driven in terms of
what are you gonna focus your attention
on
yeah so i'm going to split my time
between playing online in canada and
playing live poker in america so as a
canadian you get six months out of the
year in the us
that's basically your limit so i'm not
going to spend the entire six months out
of the year there but i'm going to spend
some amount of time playing live poker
in the states
i hope i'm hoping that games come back
to canada but it's not looking good
right now
where i live anyways
what impact do you think your
last year and a half of playing online
will have on your live game
uh depending where i play i mean i'm
gonna feel a lot more confident in my in
my abilities and like depending on which
games i play because a lot of games in
vegas can be really tough sometimes even
the live games especially during the
series
um
yeah the impact is uh i'm a lot more
confident i would say
yeah
one thing uh you said in the
questionnaire we asked you was uh you
need talent in order to have success and
i thought it was an interesting answer
especially when we looked at your
background and it took quite a long time
to uh to get to the higher stakes and
also what you've told us today with your
relentless approach to studying when you
uh had to transition to the online games
so what are some of the talents you
think that you had that allowed you to
have success in polka why do you feel
like talent's kind of a prerequisite for
success
so
maybe i didn't answer that question
completely true because like yes one
person who has let's say a person has
zero talent but they work you know a
thousand times harder than someone who
has super raw talent but they don't work
very hard they can eventually you know
overcome them but
in all practical purposes the people who
have natural talent are going to learn
quicker and become better quicker
one of the main i don't know if it's
really a talent but i have a really good
memory and i have a good ability to
remember concepts that i learned so i
just a lot of the information that i was
studying i learned a little bit quicker
than i think someone who doesn't have a
good memory would learn but i don't have
a good poker talent like my intuition
for poker and just playing poker and
trying to jedi mind trick people is
awful it's uh the the only the only good
strategies i've ever gotten from poker
have been from studying uh gto play i've
never been able to like have a good
intuition be like i think this guy has
this i'm gonna call i'm always wrong
yeah
so you double down on your memory skills
and that's why you went deep into
learning and was memory always a strong
point for you at school and growing up
was it was a strong memory relative to
your peers
um
i'd say so i think that i've been lucky
in that regard uh and being a good
learner i think that if you're a good
learner you can do a lot of things
and
i think if you're a good learner you can
overcome any talent deficiencies that
you have um
which is kind of contradictory because
you can learn to be a good learner
very true yeah i think it goes into
having like a growth mindset as well
compared to a fixed mindset the growth
mindset's always learning looking for
ways to improve and just they're always
open-minded that they can learn so like
i said if you think you can become a
good learner you can because you can't
also you can't so yeah for yourself do
you feel like you've always had a growth
mindset you've always been someone who
improves um yeah with that because i'm
trying to figure out earlier in your
career when you were playing the
microsticks i'm trying to figure out
like how it's been such a massive
transition from like that part of your
life to now where it feels like you love
learning you love strategizing you love
solving problems and learning why do you
feel like in your career you didn't
apply yourself in the same way it was
just life circumstances once we're in
the right place so what do you think
held you back early compared to where
you are now
i think at the time i thought that me
playing was learning i thought like
because when you play starcraft how do
you get better at starcraft you play
more starcraft
like chess there was some off tables
work you know you study books and
everything like that but i i just was
wrong and mistaken and i would think
that the more i played you know the
better i get um
i didn't have the right tools or group
of people to point me in the right way
and i also didn't have the motivation
and like
i wasn't willing to apply myself i guess
um
whereas like i was addicted maybe to
enjoying playing poker
whereas i should have been looking more
towards you know
how i should be playing poker
yeah you almost like didn't know what
you didn't know an ego as well probably
yeah yeah yeah yeah so when you run into
a problem now
how do you try and solve it do you try
and solve it yourself studying in the
lab do you reach out to a peer group
what's your kind of with solving
problems from the strategy side or for
just the
things you run into in life as well
yeah i have a group of people like a
dedicated group of people that i study
with um so yeah if i if i encounter
you know something
like what do you mean by problem
say you have a strategy problem or
say you experience a down swing at the
stakes you're playing and just you're
struggling at an obstacle for
and you can either try and figure out
yourself or you can reach out to
somebody who's maybe had a similar
experience or they've got a some
insights that you could learn from
yeah so first regarding strategy it's
definitely talking with people and then
working it out in the lab um
and then for downswings and like mental
game aspects i don't have like a
dedicated a dedicated group of people
for that like my group is more of just
talking about strategy um
but for that i don't know that i still
struggle with that's the hardest part of
poker is the mental game aspect
um because it doesn't matter how
successful you are it doesn't matter if
you've you've made money from poker in
the past what happens now always feels
different it's always like oh this is
awful i'm running so bad i'll never win
again but
you know you kind of inject logic into
yourself and you try
you know you try your best to i don't
know mentally overcome that
yeah what are some of the mental
obstacles you've run into recently so
yeah like i said it's one of those
things where even when you've had a lot
of success you have a downswing the mind
just blows it up to this big deal like
this is the worst thing ever so yourself
what are some of the
obstacles you ran into from mindset
perspective in the recent months the
last six months or so
so i've been lucky the last six months
like even though um even if i go on a
downswing i think more recently i've
been okay
with dealing with the financial aspect
of the downswing like even mentally it's
just i find myself frustrated sometimes
while playing um when you just
it's kind of like entitlement tilt where
if you lose
a spot where you think you know someone
has played bad or something like that i
find myself getting angry
sometimes
so yeah i guess dealing with entitlement
tilt has been the
the struggle that i've been dealing with
yeah and how does that affect your game
when you are having that entitlement
till
i think i'm relatively lucky in the
sense that it doesn't really affect how
i play but it affects my mood a lot
which is
very negative i'd rather it affect my
play than my mood
yeah and how do you get yourself out of
those moods when pogba is affecting you
how do you find that balance away from
the tables
uh exercise helps definitely um
yeah just just getting away from the
tables like it always it always calms
down your mind always calms down away
from the tables like you know take a
take a moment to take yourself out of
that situation you know inject some
logic into yourself and then
yeah move on
yeah you mentioned exercise there have
you always been someone who's used
exercise as a tool to uh change your
stance
no absolutely not i've started
exercising at the beginning of covid i
was very very
um
not physical up until then and then i
just decided to to do that i lost maybe
60 65 pounds during covid
wow amazing how did you do that did you
go to the gym yeah i just uh no surprise
i did it through diet and exercise
how has that impacted your life would
you say oh it's so much better that's
the
the best decision i've made in terms of
my health aside from quitting smoking
six years ago so yeah it's the second
best decision i've made regarding my
health so corbit for you was this really
kind of positive transition time where
obviously a lot of things were forced on
you but for whatever reason you went
into this very proactive mode so what do
you think happened with corbit obviously
you were forced to play online why was
that the moment that you decided to go
to the gym and lose weight because a lot
of people stopped going to the gym
around that time a lot of people made
excuses why now wasn't a good time so
why was that a countless moment for you
yeah i wish i wish i could pinpoint
exactly why because then i could apply
that in other other aspects of my life
it's tough to know i don't know i just
found some sort of
motivation to
to um
to do that and then motivation is
fleeting so then i found discipline to
just keep doing it
and yeah
i wish i knew that's the answer
yeah sometimes it's just about deciding
we make a clear decision that we're
going to change for whatever reason and
yeah sticking to it yeah amazing well do
not lose in that much weight it sounds
like it's had a big impact on your
energy levels your health how you feel
so that's a great great win
absolutely yeah yeah someone
transitioned to definitely would
recommend it to people so
yeah i think as well as poker players
you learn if you learn anything from the
podcast it's uh have more money and lose
weight there you go
yes you have a good bankroll so there's
no financial pressures and being in
great shape so you've got a lot of
energy and yeah i think it is important
to have a uh something about outlets
outside of poca and generally physical
outlets great because as a poor player
you go for a lot of stress there's a lot
of things that are just difficult to
deal with intellectually and you just
want to get away from the pocket tables
i feel like having a physical exercise
practice allows you to do something that
gets you completely out of your pocket
mindset and often recharges your state
so you come back from the gym or run you
get a new person it's like a reset it's
like ah factory reset button pressed
yeah
yeah that's a great way of putting it it
is kind of like a reset like a mental
reset i think it was um i was listening
to
jay nandes if you know who jay nandez is
um poker player plo player and he was
talking about how i think it was him
maybe i'm gonna attribute something to
him that wasn't him but he was talking
about how
uh humans crave like linear progression
we we crave progression and in poker
like while you're well your skill level
can be a linear progression the amount
you win in in your
in in your poker career is never a
linear progression like it's always you
know up and down up and down up and down
and it feels kind of bad sometimes um so
having things in your life that aren't
poker that you can linearly progress in
kind of help your mental state
which i agree with for sure
love working out or learning a skill
learning a language learning a skill
learning an instrument you know
something you can just
visually and and mentally and and
realistically see yourself improving at
love that yeah i think that's very like
an important human drive to uh have a
linear pursuit where you're making
progress in something and it'd be great
if poker was that straight line start to
finish linear progression but often
there's going to be these ups and downs
see i think pairing poker with something
that does have a linear progression like
learning skill for me it was always
going to the gym and lifting weights and
putting more weight on the bar
increasing my lips so this progressive
overload which i controlled so my
photographs going up and down on a
roller coaster at least i'm in the gym
putting an extra kilogram on the ball
that there and that puts the mind at
ease at least it feels like exactly
control some variables and i make a
progress and area of my life which i
deem as important i think having that as
a poker player is really important
yeah and control in the uncontrollable
world of poker is important someone
transitioned to you were starting your
youtube channel and you're doing your
play and explained videos which are
super popular amazing to watch on your
help me channel if anyone hasn't seen
that make sure to check it out what was
the motivation behind
creating content on youtube
uh to learn
to learn because when you post when you
post something you're accountable and
you have all of the chat pros that go in
the comments and you know tell you
whether you've played good or bad uh
whether they're right or wrong and it
kind of like it's a good way of
reviewing your play
and
yeah to learn and also motivation to
play because when i post a video and you
get that feedback
um it motivates you to improve and to
play more
um so yeah motivation and learning are
the two reasons that i started that uh
definitely not money uh you can't really
make money from doing stuff like that
and what are some of the lessons that
you've learned during that journey and
i've been doing about a year now
um
lessons like as a general sense um
i'm not quite i'm not quite sure
i learned i learned a few specific
things
like um just from making mistakes in the
video because like
the best way to learn is is to make
mistakes but the only way that you can
learn from the mistakes is if you know
you make the mistakes so if you're just
reviewing your own game all the time and
you're looking at things that you think
might be mistakes you're just gonna find
the things that you thought were
mistakes
the real mistakes are the ones that you
did and you thought it wasn't a mistake
you're like oh no this is fine like i
did that like i'm not even gonna check
that but then
if you correct those you're gonna be a
way more well-rounded player so just
like
little things like that
um learning from my mistakes i guess
would be the best lesson
yeah so it sounds like it highlighted
some of your blind spots things that you
weren't aware of then people will call
you out in the chat yeah exactly blind
spots that's a good way
yeah and right now i know you're sure
yeah and like whether they're right or
wrong like
yeah exactly they're always going to
call you out fun any small mistake
everybody i know you've been playing um
on youtube and you've been streaming
your sessions i think you compared it to
a plain naked oh like expose yourself
naked in public being able to uh expose
your game like that so yeah you want to
talk about your experiences playing
streaming and how you found that process
as well no i can i can definitely relate
with with jaredman you view a certain
extra
yeah i i don't really want to call it
pressure it's more like yeah
you're going to be extra critical i
personally love chat pros as well
because i've definitely had people in
the chat say something like hey wouldn't
this be a better play or something
some people you know are quite extreme
this is just horrible yeah
okay yeah what am i gonna do with that
piece of information but then still i'll
i'll reframe it like okay was this
horrible you know i always try to try to
learn from it and over over all the
twitch hours that i make there has
definitely been people are like oh yeah
oh i would have i would have liked to
see your ra there's there's one guy who
always comes back sometimes
and then it's like he comes with a very
analytical answer then he says last time
he said i've been following you now for
the last couple of months i see you've
made a lot of improvements like okay
thank you very much
but i do still think there are a couple
of these river race spots where you
would like to call instead of race for
example the hand you played 15 minutes
ago and then actually there were a
couple of good points i was like
actually that that is indeed a good
point i should have should have
considered racing there i didn't so
thank you very much but indeed i i
compared it i don't know how jared saw
this like your first videos i tried to
go back in your youtube channel i could
go back i think one year but it said
yeah
i removed all the videos that had uh the
hud showing
uh
all right it was because of that did you
experience the same thing i i exactly
what ellen just said i i compared it to
you go on stage you take off your
clothes you say hey man no this is what
i'm working yeah it's a little bit but
it's not the same as streaming because
if uh if i truly had something horrible
happen in a session that i didn't want
to show i could always just not upload
the video but when you're streaming
you're truly naked like you can't go
back like unless you quickly cut it off
because there's a delay like you're
gonna show everything so to a degree yes
but not as much as streaming streaming's
on a slightly different level i would
say
i mean i from personal experience i
could tell you could still switch
right you show table one well yeah yeah
you're blocking your way a stack for
example right
i i or or like maybe you know there's a
play that
you don't really want to show i've had
that sometimes like oh this is a great i
don't want to show that yeah or
something but i don't want to have
questions about it because i'm not even
going to answer it and then i just and
then i just don't show it for example or
very exploit default that i don't even
want to get into right then i then
people have maybe not even seen it
but yeah i i do understand what you mean
for the
uh
for the extra motivation i thought there
were a couple of points in your in when
you were talking to adam that i thought
was interesting especially the
the cove it happened and there's indeed
a lot of people that were like oh covet
happened so now i can't do a b c d e and
we drew it was kind of the opposite
right which again shows covet happens
it's something neutral how we respond to
that will kind of determine where our
life is going right i think this is a if
you have this quality same with like how
you approach online poker tough games
okay this is an opportunity for me to
grow kovit is an opportunity for me to
do this right you see things as an
opportunity as a threat which i think is
a very
a very important skill
you also talked about
that you now see your mistakes i want to
kind of reflect on
all the way early in your career the
first five years yeah you are only
playing and never reflecting
right
now you are willing to look at your game
and look for mistakes mm-hmm whereas in
the past yeah you didn't i think
reviewing your own game and finding
mistakes is like the most important
thing um
because like yes you need to do the off
table study work and and and learn the
strategies and yes if you learned if you
learned the strategies so well that you
never made mistakes good for you you
know your linus love but
if you can't do that you're a normal
human being then you got to look at your
mistakes and where you're misapplying
the strategies or where you're not doing
it and like finding the mistakes that
you didn't know were mistakes
is the best i think
so how do we find the mistakes that we
don't know is mistakes
database analysis or video review um
re reviewing hands that you haven't
tagged
yeah i notice in my uh in my cfp instead
of having them tag hands and discussing
those
we would for example discuss a specific
spot bought the verse big blind and then
next week's session i would have them
send over all their hands and i would
just go over every bottom versus big
blind hand that they played of all my
students that's quite time consuming
yeah but i would then pick out exactly
these are interesting else they would
not
they would not have picked those
right i think video reviews are perfect
for that
yeah 100 um like when i have students um
what we usually start with is a database
review and then if i see if any stats
are deviated i'll just go into the spot
and do exactly what you just said which
is go through literally every hand if
it's practical if they don't have like a
10 million hand sample and just look at
literally every hand and then i will tag
the ones that i think are mistakes and
very often they're like oh i didn't know
this was a mistake i didn't know this
was a mistake yeah i know we then we
work very similar i would look at their
hot stats and be like e this step seems
a little bit off and and you usually
then if you compare a couple of stats
you kind of see what their strategies
and what the flaw is and then i'll go
out and pick a couple of hands whereas
like yeah you see this is where you
apparently have a wrong logic then i
would usually have them explain the hand
i think this is a very important process
like explain me the hand why you played
it this way because i want to hear i
want to hear that flaw right
especially as a coach i think it's very
important that you don't say you played
this wrong you should play it like this
whereas like explain me what you think
and then i'll correct exactly where you
go wrong at the end
you have to fix the logic not the
mistake exactly
yeah to to to have lasting change right
else the guy will just have like a whole
list of like i shouldn't do this i
shouldn't do this i shouldn't do this i
shouldn't do this and then he goes to
play and what does he do
he does it
because we haven't fixed the correction
basically so what do you think is
holding most people back when they're
not successful at poker because like you
said it can be a money constraint um but
i see a lot of people
who they'll come in and you know they'll
they'll play and i think wow this
person's really really smart and then i
never hear from them again and they just
they quit poker like either they're not
interested or they just didn't succeed
variance hits them there's a lot of
reasons do you have any insights into
what's holding new players back so i can
give a i think it's best if i give an
answer more technical related then i'll
pass it over to adam more mental game
related i mean mental game related we
can
you could answer this question in a
million ways right uh
some sort of self-sabotage coming up i
think technically speaking uh maybe
i always feel like
um
there's various answers can be found in
various areas right you can go into a
solver and find the answer but sometimes
if you always do that and you stay stuck
apparently you're either doing it wrong
right that that's one or the answer that
you're looking for is maybe not in that
corner maybe in order for you to
progress you should work on a more
exploitative game right maybe work with
more databases and analysis uh stuff
stuff like that so i think looking for
the answers in the same
in the same section all the time even
though you're not finding the answer
there that could be i think from a
technical perspective
uh uh a problem but as you said if you
think they're very good players but you
don't see them anymore
i would say usually i have to not pass
over the ball to adam i would say
usually there's mentally something going
on
yeah that's what i think i think that
it's usually a mental issue mental game
issue rather yeah yeah so we take an
example of a talented player who comes
to you for coaching and you're like oh
this guy's got it he's going to be great
and then he's disappears off the radar
a lot of those players very often
they've got unrealistic expectations
their ego is very fragile so when they
take a bit of the hit they very quickly
take that as a personal kind of sign
that they're not good at this whereas i
feel like they often struggle to have a
long-term perspective and committed to
the long-term so for example like your
mindset that you've got jared is perfect
for that person because they need to
take a long-term learning model and they
need to realize okay i'm going to take
setbacks in the short term and to keep
going i find often those talented
players often they were talented yeah
other things as well so they've invested
their identity in being good at
something so now when they make a
mistake rather than being a learning
opportunity it's now a judgment of them
and they're like whoa whoa i don't want
to too much of this this is a bit scary
they often back up yeah
when you tell them that they made a
mistake like you're coaching someone and
then they get really offended you're
like why'd you ask me for coaching then
yeah yeah it's almost like a judgement
it's almost in those plays you've got to
almost be very careful with them it's
like oh i'm trying to give you advice
here but just realize it's just a
mistake in your strategy it's not you as
an individual that's a flawed in any way
but i think that's often the obstacle
with talented players who are often
obviously very smart very capable like i
think from a coaching perspective we can
identify these kind of talented players
who have everything capable of making
good good results in good careers yeah
very often i think that short-term
entitlement and just that almost like
inability to be curious and want to
learn because they've invested so much
in their their identity in their current
abilities i think is a common one
yeah it sounds like a classic fixed
mindset right yeah
i think also like in terms of motivation
maybe they're shorter motivated like i
want to see if i can do this then they
then i did it there's no more
they they cannot really find new
motivation right they had too much
short-term goals
uh that they're not in it for the long
run i also feel like if i can compare
uh if i'm trying to think of like
students who made it students who didn't
made it maybe also being
too
for example i can watch your youtube
videos right
and i can focus on i'm trying to learn
something here or i can look at what is
jared doing wrong and i'm gonna point
him out on that
it's i'm seeing the same video but what
i will actually get from it will be
completely different and i notice in
coaching i had that as well where i had
some other guys that would say okay mr
weka so you're telling me i should do
this and this and this is going to work
great and they would relentlessly
execute whereas you would have
other guys would be like they would
always come with the yeah but
yeah but yeah
yeah
but
they're trying to it's amazing
i know but nothing is perfect right
we're playing a game of incomplete
information we're all just trying to
guess better than the other person of
what we should do in that spot yes this
is not bulletproof but hey it's gonna
work 90 of the time so i guess also
really seeing the bigger picture instead
of focusing on all the small nuances and
then they can they kind of get lost in
the nuances and they find it very hard
to translate their off-game game to
in-game performance
right so like also a little bit of a
little bit of confidence over
perfectionistic
right they might they might you know
in a coaching session you might have
with a guy you're like oh wait who's
coaching who actually this guy is this
guy is brilliant right but then when he
when he goes to play it doesn't come out
because he's way too perfectionist is he
way too analytical
some people can be better at talking
about poker than playing poker that's
for sure
yes for sure and actually i
i i can i can see myself
in that until a certain extent i
remember especially in the past people
around me they would hype me up sort of
and remember this is like eight years
ago or something seven years ago i would
get very confused because i would talk
strategy with guys who are making way
more money than me and i was always
teaching them
but i was more of that over analytical
guy where they would listen to what i
said and relevantly apply it i would
have to first understand it 100
and i would be very careful and then if
it worked a couple of times i would be
like ah it's probably not working
anymore right i would project like my
knowledge on the population now they
probably figured this out
before there was actually proof that
that was actually the case so i would do
a lot of cool things but for a way short
a very short period of time
and then like years from then the other
guys are still applying that and it's
working great whereas i already thought
ah people now call up on that
so i guess this is
definitely something that you see
yeah like applying your thinking that
your opponents know what you know is uh
is definitely a strategy mistake i think
yes
it's it's i will have a little fix on
that i might share it for our listeners
what i what i would do because it
doesn't happen all that often but
sometimes i can get into that mindset i
will have basically my hut a print
screen of my heart open on my screen
and then when i start to project i'm
like this is me this is my game how i
think about poker in stats so if i would
then look at someone else that's like we
don't think the same about poker right
yeah so exactly i'm gonna project my
knowledge on this on this opponent
all right so we have a little tip for
online players
i think that that that really that's a
good tip i think
absolutely um
reflecting
on on your nine-year journey right what
was the was the main reason you think it
took nine years instead of four and a
half if we can narrow it down we already
have money be healthy
what was the main reason it took so long
the reason it took so long was
like the main reason was
not approaching the game in the right
way to begin with um which was just
a combination of ego maybe laziness and
um
lack of information
and not understanding what poker was
really about right not not owning
people's souls
exactly yeah yeah like like
it's not about owning people it's about
playing good poker good strategy poker
and that didn't come in until way too
late into my poker career or whatever
you call it
one what was the one thing
reflecting on it
that poker has brought you that you did
not expect
uh perspective on life
like sometimes things go bad in life and
if you have a good perspective on poker
and that you know sometimes things go
bad but sometimes things it always turns
around in the end if you're if you're if
you have a good strategy in poker
sometimes things are bad but then at the
long term it's going to be good so if
you have a good approach to life and
you're doing good things in life usually
in the long term it's gonna work itself
out so it actually ended up giving me a
bit of a positive attitude towards life
which i didn't quite expect i would have
thought the opposite but again that's
just my it's it's about your approach to
poker not about like anything else right
it's
the way that you interpret it
exactly and i think this is a
a missed opportunity for most poker
players who kind of see poke as just
this thing where for which they show up
they expect a certain hourly they grind
four hours and that's it
and whereas you really use poker as a
certain a certain area where you can
challenge yourself and really develop
yourself and i i completely agree with
that i have i've always had the same
mindset towards poker and everything
that i learned
around being a poker player i mean there
are skills for life sometimes people
talk about yeah what if you would ever
try to get a real job right that's like
that old uh that old thing that people
are afraid of actually maybe it's still
up until today where they're like yeah i
have a gap in my cv and then i played
poker i mean if you it's all about how
you if you do a future interview
first it's about how you sell being a
poker player
right i mean there's many aspects that i
can highlight that poker player has
taught me that would do well in other
areas as well and i personally always
say if that if if the person that i
would be applying for a job for
does not think poker is a great
background for a person to hire i
probably don't want to work for that
person anyway so yeah kind of like
two points there yeah and like i just
want to make one thing clear like i do
have like a bit of a love hate
relationship with poker there are times
where i'm thinking like why did i choose
this you know but those are those are
less so than the long-term thought of
what i'm doing is something that i enjoy
and i want to do
it's not all roses it's not all sunshine
and roses
okay so thank you for pointing out that
you're human
yeah exactly
i am this is this is the
one listening this is number one rule
like everyone experiences ups and downs
right
exactly exactly like if you're playing
poker and you're like oh everything's
not great for me like that's just life
that's how you approach it i guess
actually it's funny because we're saying
this now and if i don't think yeah but
lightest probably doesn't have that
that's the [ __ ] that i got myself in my
bike those lines have up and down as
well does lioness sometimes doubt
himself like am i really really that
good do you think he doubts himself yeah
probably not no like i i don't think so
basically we're asking here is human
yeah like is he human i guess like
technically he is i don't know him i've
never met him
any any
any reflections on this adam
yeah i've just got a little segway
question which i think is would be a
good stage and it's what is the your
definition of success at this stage of
your life i know you've been a long
poker journey and it sounds like you're
very much treating poker like
almost like a way of leveling up
yourself as a person and you're enjoying
the pursuit so i think it'd be
interesting to know at this stage how do
you define success in your life and
what's the kind of goal you're reaching
towards so success in my life i define
as improving myself and having a good
daily life like a life that i enjoy and
i find at least relatively fulfilling um
i think that constantly learning and
improving yourself is key otherwise life
starts to get a little bit stagnant
um success in poker i think for me right
now is defined as um again continually
learning uh it's it's tough to to move
up in poker
to have that goal like once you reach a
certain level like i'm trying to play 2k
right now and the skill gap between 2k
and everything else is is very very high
so i do still have some goals in in
strategy and playing but really the
successes is built around yeah just
trying to improve i guess
yeah awesome does that also apply
outside of poca for yourself so if
success model for you involves learning
grow and improving do you apply that to
your health your relationships or to uh
your life in a broader context i would
say the poker as well
yeah absolutely i think that it's very
important at least for me it's it's very
important to be improving in some way um
the
least good moments of my life and
periods of my life were the times where
i was stagnant or declining and the best
periods of my life have been when i've
been improving and learning so
empirically what
it's uh i should keep learning
yeah i can relate to that as well it's
like my highest value is growth which to
me means improving learning and getting
better at something and every time in
life where i've had a kind of rough
patch or i wasn't enjoying what i was
doing it was always because i wasn't
learning i wasn't growing during that
years and often like we talked about
with kind of balancing polka with cs
health and doing a gym a gym goal or
doing something outside of it if we're
too one track minded or we go all in on
something and then progression or
learning in that avenue stops you can
create a lot of inner conflict
especially if linear growth is one of
your highest values so yeah i think it's
it's really good to know that because it
probably means your values are around
line and growth and we're all different
some people's values are around family
or health or relationships and yes it's
good to know that you're elena and len
is a big kind of part of your success
model so yeah really really good that
you're in alignment with that and it
sounds like polka is the perfect vehicle
for you to be able to take that on a
daily basis and learning yeah and then
i'm sure if it wasn't the case i'm sure
if you got the point where you weren't
learning poker like in a love-hate
relationship would get very hit
orientated quickly
for sure
i'm very lucky with poker i think all of
us are who want to keep learning um in
that there's always something to learn
in poker and if you think that you've
reached a point where there's not then
you probably just you're just wrong like
there's always something to learn it
doesn't matter like if if you really
truly think that you've reached the
point where there's nothing to learn i
think that's a a personal leak
because there's always something
yeah yeah i feel like it's very
counter-intuitive
right basically
challenging yourself
and pushing yourself is actually easier
than not pushing yourself because if you
would not be pushing yourself you would
stagnate you would feel less energy you
feel less motivated yeah then you will
play worse you will get frustrated
because you're playing worse whereas if
you're challenging yourself and playing
versus better players which seems harder
but it actually gives i like to always
talk about energy one grind costs energy
the other grind gives a lot of energy
back you're motivated so i think that's
it's
really counter-intuitive but i feel like
definitely true i can definitely relate
to that strategy wise as well my poker
feel sorry if poker starts to feel like
a grind for me it's because i'm not
implementing new strategies that's why
i'm in general growth as well and
creativity are definitely my main values
so in my game you would always see
creativity even though it's not
necessary i should probably simplify if
i start doing that poker feels like a
grind for me i need i need bursts of
creativity i need to make weird plays
okay okay i respect that yeah
my plays are like the opposite but i
don't feel the need for creativity in my
play
so that that makes a lot of sense
yeah and again it's important to know
yourself right
yeah absolutely
i remember right now for one of your
kind of priming exercises before your
session you would write down things like
i want to have fun and i want to be
playful and that goes in line with your
kind of wanting to learn and being
creative so is that something that those
other values for you having fun with
what you're doing
exactly and it also it it reminds me of
that poker isn't about you know that i
have to win this session it's about ah
this is a great opportunity to express
my creativity
right to be curious to look for spots at
the tables that i don't even know are
out there right
this is also helpful if you see other
people make a play it helps you instead
of judging it for what is this it's like
i'm curious for it so i think curiosity
for me is the as soon as i i always
prime myself to be curious in my session
because if i'm curious in my session i
will just like what jared said i will
ask myself interesting questions out of
which comes interesting answers right
it's the question that you ask yourself
that will determine what you're looking
for
if you don't ask yourself any questions
or if you have you ask yourself only
what do i do here
yeah you default back to like your
default but indeed what jared also said
like what are the ranges how is
interaction uh you know these lead to
different strategies so the questions
you ask yourself the ben
kind of define the output
uh
at the tables
yeah i think that's a good point about
um seeing a crazy play and instead of
judging it saying oh maybe is there
something there let's find out
i think that's the right mindset for
sure
so going forward
you mentioned that you've been taking
some shots and that there's a very big
skill gap between 1k 2k i can definitely
relate to that there's quite a lot of
players who play 500 to 1k maybe shot
some 2k and then you have a couple of
guys who just play 2k plus
so you will indeed
face certain opposition
um
what do you think
in order to make that jump what do you
think are some things that are still
holding you back that you should improve
upon
um
things that are holding me back that i
shouldn't that aren't improvable are the
amount of volume that you can play in
those games it's really tough to get a
decent sample in those games they don't
run as often as other games but things
that are holding me back like skill and
improvement wise uh i wish i knew
could you tell me i'm trying really hard
to learn what i need to know if i knew
that i probably would wouldn't be held
back right
good point good one
yeah
for myself i kind of have an idea of
which areas in my game i can still
improve upon uh i still see myself
making certain mistakes and they those
mistakes might have a team that i'm
working on right like okay
it's not necessarily a lot of things
that i have or not necessarily technical
mistakes but they're kind of mental
flaws that i can fall back into it's
like oh i did it again
yeah yeah i think um without going into
too much specifics on directly how to
exploit me uh
i think using still like trying to
understand river spots better and how
blockers interact with ranges and why
it's still something i'm trying to
improve
on which again like i'm trying to
improve on every aspect of my game
because again i think every aspect of
every poker player's game can always be
improved every spot every aspect but um
that's the one that i think i'm
struggling with the most
all right in terms of uh are there still
like some uh some bad habits that you
should know you shouldn't be doing but
you know sometimes that uh
that fps
takes the bet hold on yeah yeah or
very
rarely um it doesn't happen nowadays
yeah i've gotten really good at that uh
i did it once in my trip to vegas where
i did a fancy play but it worked so that
was good
that's dangerous
yeah it's you're like oh i should do
this more often i i like uh it's a weird
spot i i dunked the river we had like
20k behind the pot was like
2 000. and i dunked the river he raised
me and i three-bed jammed with the bluff
and he folded a set apparently but um
yeah it was a very fancy play
was not a good player hey i'm not a
all i hear is donkey donkeys and i hear
people fooling sets awesome play
he could not have any of the good hands
he could only like his his best hand was
like maybe bottom set and that's what he
folded so
okay you got you got someone to default
range the ev of the play is
quite high
i guess so but i mean it was like
also there was i i've had a play a long
time ago i played that hand where i also
front dunked the river in a spot where i
was like okay i basically have no bluffs
in this line
and he basically has his fault and then
after like two three minutes was live as
well he kind of open folded the the sort
of nuts that he could have so basically
he was folding range those are
just
listen but like those plays are great
when you make them because you
intuitively feel like this is the moment
but where when you go play cards
with the wrong mentality i'm like okay
i'm here to own people then you will
suddenly be exactly like
exactly can i own people here like
that's exactly what i used to do is like
try to create the spots like that
whereas naturally that spot would happen
once a year
exactly and that is kind of the
difference right
also in terms of uh live poker
you you were talking about that you're
gonna kind of divide your time
um if you like your skill set for in
order to play tougher games live poker
still needs to improve
uh i think the this is going to sound
really um
let me try to find a right way to word
this
to play high stakes poker nowadays
it's more about who you know and how you
act than how you play um how you play
poker is isn't relevant in terms of
your
strategy versus their strategy every
every big game is basically private now
there's no public big games so it's not
people battling it's how can i you know
first of all don't be a dick you know be
a nice guy
um treat everyone with respect and just
try to be fun at the table try to try to
make it so people want to play with you
even if they think they're better than
you or that you're better than them
which may or may not be true
interesting yes and that is indeed
actually highlights another skill from a
successful poker player the ability to
actually get to play in those games
right like we could call this like
networking sure
right sure it's it's interesting it's
another another aspect like becoming a
successful poker player has a various
aspect like all the technical stuff that
we talk about is only
a part of it but in the end yeah if you
can print in those private games
right where
maybe you're up against
quite a lot of
a lot more recreational players
i mean that's a great skill to have
yeah like the probably the person who's
won the most money playing poker is not
the best poker player
that's the person
plays in the better games
yeah sure dan bizarian rick solomon
whatever right like these people have
made probably way more money than linus
let's say
yeah and here we are
fighting small edges on 500 ml zoom
they must be laughing
they literally are laughing at us
yeah they're like what the hell are
these guys doing
yeah i know
any common common common mistakes for i
think actually i don't know if our
audience is mainly online is that any
any very common mistakes that you think
our audience must be making when they
transition from online to life
give them a little tip um
oh when you transition from online to
live yeah okay so it depends what yeah
the next question was gonna be vice
okay um so live
it depends how high you're playing
because if you're playing short-handed
live against really good opponents it's
the same game like unless uh the
structure is different but usually what
you're talking about is people playing
like micro stakes or low stakes online
and then going to play two five at their
local casino um and i think that like
holding holding rigid ideas of what your
opponent should be doing is the main
mistake that people make when they're
playing live like get that get that
thought of your head like well my
opponent should have this and this and
this and like no he doesn't he has this
he has nothing even close to that he
wasn't even thinking about that he was
checking out the waitress's ass he
doesn't know what range he has like just
just play your game you know like it's
people people try to do too much i would
say and like attribute too much and try
to implement too much and it's
a lot of playing live low stakes is just
playing like good simple solid poker
and wait for them to hand you over the
money
they usually do they usually do hand you
over the money like just you know just
play good play well
again there you go play well problem
solved
yeah we've had a lot of good tips this
one goes within a lot of it
wait you should exercise in diet
yeah exactly really good advice i'm
writing a book
and vice
versa
uh so going from live to online so let's
say you're like a
a 510 grinder
who beats 510 and you want to play some
online i think the transition from live
to online requires probably a lot of
work that they're not
used to
you need to study
good pre-flop ranges good theory good
strategies you have to know at least the
common spots
uh it's a lot different than playing
live 510 like the the raw poker skill
required to beat live 510
isn't that high like no offense to
anyone playing live 510. uh but to beat
like 200 zoom or like you know online
one two two five you do need that raw
knowledge
um so yeah i would just say you need to
put the work in you do you have to put
the work in is the only way to do it
yeah whereas maybe in in life you know
if you indeed have if you have a certain
talent for figuring out a couple spots
but online you know the fundamental
spots they they will just eat you up
basically
yeah even though you know you make a
great play here and there you know your
intuition is on here and there it just
doesn't make up for the fundamental
theoretical mistakes that you're
constantly making in smaller spots
exactly exactly you need to know the
fundamentals
so what are your uh what are what are
your goals and aspirations in poker
going forward
where can we see you where where do you
want to be in a couple of years
uh poker wise i think where i want to be
in a couple years is like i said trans
playing
uh some portion of my time online some
portion of my time live
i'd like to be like stakes wise
relatively where i am right now um maybe
you know shouting 5k occasionally in
good games online uh but playing playing
as big as i can get into live within
reason
um
and yeah that's that's where i'd want to
be poker wise i mean hopefully i'm a a
better poker player
uh in two years time
but yeah like in terms of where i've
where i've reached in poker i'm happy in
in in the stakes and the levels that
i've reached
i don't think i'm going my goal isn't to
go much higher than what i play right
now basically
all right clear any any final questions
for our guest adam
i just want to ask how was your vegas
trip and i've been in world's biggest
for the world series how was that trip
were you playing tournaments were you
playing cash games how did you trip go
overall
yeah so the trip was a lot of fun i
played a bunch of tournaments um i
studied a bunch of tournaments as well
which again is fun because you know
learning something new um
i lost a lot of money but other than
other than that the trip was really fun
uh the poker the tournaments were good
they were fun the fields were good the
cash games were pretty tough it was like
all the people that you play with online
were basically there which is you know
during the series is what you expect
there's a lot of european players there
a lot of pros
um
i got into some of the bigger games some
of the time and those were fun the games
are usually good i didn't run good
but you know when you play only 500
hands it's it's tough to
it's tough to always run good
yeah so you you
see i see you someone who likes to learn
lessons and you always take a positive
angle from things so even though you
lost money from vegas what was the
biggest positive perspective taking away
from that trip
um from that trip
i mean i guess that
positive perspective
well i mean other than i just had a
really good time and it was a good
learning experience for tournaments um
regarding you know losing money it's
just it's it's at this point it feels
kind of part of the job although at one
point you know i had lost
i'd lost
enough money that it was uh significant
to me like financially
uh which is never fun right when you're
on a trip but i ended up
rebounding you know results wise and i
ended up not losing as much but i was
just
while that was happening while i was
losing so much i was proud of the way
that i handled myself in that
i still kept playing i kept playing my
game
it didn't put me off too much like yes i
was upset um but you're allowed to be
upset when you're losing
absorbent amounts of money i think uh
it's just the way that you handle
yourself afterwards which i was happy
with
yeah i think that's an underrated skill
set as well like how taking pride in
being able to deal with bad variants by
results and yeah it's been a look back
at yourself during that period and go
you know what i kept myself together i
kept showing up i kept working through
it yes it was tough didn't like going
through it but to take pride in your
ability to uh go for adversity i think
it's a really really big skill set so
yeah i like that lesson learned from
your trip
yeah
yeah being proud and having compassion
absolutely and like if it happens again
i'll be i'll be better equipped to
to deal with it now yeah compassion
towards yourself is uh
is something that's very difficult for
me to do
um what i try to do i'm curious like if
you if you go play live and you play
very big and then you go back to canada
and you play
significantly lower like let's say for
example you lost a lot in a 20k and l
game
it's very hard to to make up for those
losses playing max 2k online how do you
deal with that mentally how do you
switch yeah so
yeah you have to get rid of the the
mindset of winning it back that's like
the first thing you need to lose as a
poker player is the mindset of trying to
win something back like that money's
gone it's you don't have it anymore you
can't win it back it's gone like there's
no winning any money back like it's it's
you let it on fire it's gone you forget
about it it's a lot easier said than
done though uh it's very difficult to go
back to the games after you know you're
playing a game that has a 400 straddle
sometimes
and it's it's tough you know you're
playing with a buy-in the size of the
straddle
but
it's just again like that money's gone
it's it's a con they're two completely
separate
uh universes and you have to keep them
separate in your brain otherwise
yeah you can't you can't grind it back
and this is the thing right realistic
expectations because if your expectation
is okay i'm going to try to win it
backwards it's completely unrealistic
and reality strikes you in the face yeah
you will start filming
yeah
yeah absolutely maybe also like you're
very you're a strategic lover right so
it's not like you're necessarily gonna
play to win it back you you're gonna go
play online poker because you know it's
like oh i'm happy to go play online
poker again because i have the strategic
things that i'm working on maybe it's
also you still see it a little bit more
like that that you can get excited for
the strategic and competitive aspect and
life maybe a bit more hey maybe i'll
have a good payday today
yeah i wish i wish i was completely
detached from the results and i could
just focus on the strategy and analyze
like analyze just the strategy because
that's the part i enjoy
um about poker obviously so
yeah that would be the goal is to is to
focus on the strategy and like i'm going
to go here and i'm going to play this to
try to whatever implement whatever
strategy and learn whatever strategy
so do you have any uh any final thing
final final thoughts um well thank you
for having me this was fun
um
i like the way renee that you explain
poker and talk about poker um like i
watched all your youtube videos and i
watch you stream sometimes uh streaming
not so much just because i don't watch
twitch that much but i watched all your
youtube videos and i like the way that
you always uh approach poker and like
the way of the way of your
uh what's the word analytics or the way
that you analyze poker
um
which is of course why i like to come on
the podcast and talk things poker with
you and
it seems like we have a lot of all three
of us
uh
similar approaches to like certain
aspects of poker adam i don't know your
background in poker i know what you do
currently now
um
did you come from like an online
background like a live background
yeah i played online heads up sitting
goes from 2011 to 2017. so i went like
okay
yeah
that makes sense
moved and built your way up okay so yeah
it seems like we all have kind of
similar views on a lot of things in
poker but like i would say our play
styles rene are a lot different which is
interesting
yeah like a little bit like you're
you're you're implementing more things
in your game than i am i think i'm
trying to simplify
maybe a little bit too much at times but
um
like obviously everyone's game is
similar nowadays because if it's not
you're losing money like you're you can
only do so many plus cv strategies but
um
yeah i just find it interesting how
people with like the similar approaches
to poker can end up with different
strategies and i think it i think it was
you you said that creativity was a an
important part of your life and the way
you play poker and i found that really
interesting because uh i wish i could
find
the thing
that
i need
um and apply that to poker and just have
it be a more fulfilling experience which
it sounds like it is for you
yeah again it it it but i i think for
you it was also really this strategical
aspect right
where it's for me yeah yeah exactly the
strategic aspect as well but i think the
biggest difference that i usually notice
between me and maybe other other players
especially like i would say newer school
because i'm basically a dinosaur in
poker right uh
we could go we can call myself that
whereas in the past i think creativity
was really well rewarded because there
was no solver right you had to figure
out what to come up with
nowadays exactly like with solvers i do
still try
to
instead of saying hey solvers solvers
are here now the room for creativity is
gone i don't believe that i think you
can still play creative with a solver
for example right you can still be yeah
yeah be creative in that and i think
it's again the questions that you ask
yourself right i
most players are really playing from a
base that they
okay own solid base other people deviate
my strategy wins right where i
understand all that and i try to do that
as well as possible but i'm always
looking for
opportunities where i can deviate to
make higher ev right that that is that
is still the thing that i like the most
uh sometimes i will over apply that
right but i'm still i would still call
myself more of an exploitative player
that's fair yeah and i guess that's the
difference that i'm describing between
our games and that's something that you
know if i plan to play like 500 zoom for
long term that's something i should
start working on on my game and i think
that it makes you a lot more money than
most people give it credit for but it
also makes less money than some
exploitative people give it credit for
and it seems like you've hit kind of the
sweet spot where you play a good theory
strategy but then also find these
opportunities to deviate because if you
go in with the the approach of like i'm
just gonna play if i'm gonna play
exploitative it ends up being like that
jedi mind tricks like you described
yeah and that's exactly that's not at
all the frame that i come from i can't
come from a frame i'm gonna play
right i'm gonna play solid i understand
the gto concepts
i do always have like general population
tendencies and psychology how people
construct ranges and where i think
unbalances occur top of mind and then
from there i still still look at who is
my opponent who is my opponents always
one of the highest questions that i have
on my list whereas
newer school players have that question
very low on their list i start with that
if it's even on the list because if if
the answer to that question is my
opponent deviates a lot to the right a
lot to the left that's gonna
i want my train to of thought in the
rest of the hand to have that highest in
consideration so i don't end up you know
making some gto hero call versus a
complete knit right
yeah
that's exactly i think
my opponent is jared man i'm like okay
cherub man is pretty pretty solid player
so i'm a little bit more handcuffed
right in terms of what i can get away
with what i'm gonna do
so against you for example i might
just play try to play more solid whereas
if i see an opponent who's maybe a
little bit less competent uh that that's
when i get in my element because i can
do a lot of [ __ ] right
yeah but the only reason you can do the
[ __ ] is because you know how to play
solid a lot of people don't get that
that you need to learn how to play solid
first and then you can do the [ __ ]
because if you can't play solid it's
there's no point like you need to have
that gto baseline and then you can
exploit people it's a big misconception
that it's like exploitative versus gto
but really it's just the same thing
it is the same thing yeah only the
question that you have to have to ask
yourself always and that's the question
i does theory
like the exact
uh outcome of theory does it theory
always implies but exactly how how it
applies just like in a solver
uh
it does it and i know this poker for me
i play worse
and it's the least enjoyable when i go
in the
mindset of okay what do i have to do
there and then then the what
is like solver that's when poker is
least enjoyable for me it's also not i
would say my pure strength and then
creativity gets lost and i play worse
right where every time when i go back
okay what am i trying to achieve my hand
and then when i say what do you have to
do what does the wacko what would the
echo do
and then then yeah so
the magic comes you know
yeah when i personally when i stopped
thinking in terms of okay what would the
solver do and more in terms of
why is it doing this therefore why
should i be betting this here
that really helped my game so yeah i
agree
do you still notice sometimes that you
fall back in in in like what does the
solver do patterns
uh when it comes to choosing bet sizes
on the flop
yes because that is a that is a little
bit of memorization i don't think it's
super intuitive to know like which bet
sizes are good on which flops unless
you've looked at a sim
um but other than that no i i've been
pretty good lately and deciding what to
do for good theory reasons rather than
deciding what to do because i remember
that the solver did this one time
and i find that it improved my game a
lot
for me i asked that question for you how
to get higher for me is to think like
that more consistently i i'm not happy
with the amount of time
that my mind still goes to too much
theory
type of stuff
so that for me is a room of improvement
even though i'm i'm an absolute advocate
of not doing that i still
feel like percentage white i do that too
often and i would say almost all my
mistakes
are related to that
and also the misapplication of theory as
well
yeah misapplication is the most
dangerous thing
but yeah like over applying a certain
concept
yeah definitely
you got to be careful when you learn new
concepts in poker you have to
um realize that it doesn't always apply
to every single situation like i
remember when i first learned i know
we're going back a little bit but here
when i first learned about over betting
turns i would just over bet every turn
all the time my turn c but was like 80
or something i was like that's it we can
it's a turn we can over bet i'm over
betting i didn't care what it was
yeah you're you're so fixated on the ev
of the over bat that you forget to take
in consideration the v of the other
options right
yeah exactly or why we're over betting
and why we're allowed to overbed
yeah and then you start to get blind for
for the other opportunities
exactly exactly you get too fixated on
one thing
all right well adam if you don't have
any final questions or if jared doesn't
have any final words
then i think we're gonna round it up
here
no final words they're both very
silently looking at me no final words
okay yeah well jared i really want to
thank you for coming on also thank you

about my content i really appreciate
your content too shout out again youtube

way of explaining i think everyone would

out
well thank you very much and thank you
for having me adam it's nice to meet you
thanks for having me on the podcast you
too randy nice thanks for having me it
was a lot of fun
wow what a great conversation that was
with jaredman a lot of goodness in there
very curious about your takeaways adam
yeah that was a great conversation and
yeah there's so many amazing takeaways
that hopefully the audience picked up on
one of the main trend lines that i got
going through that whole conversation
was jared's ability to turn obstacles
into opportunities he almost has this
kind of superpower to reframe everything
as a learning opportunity and something
he can get better from and as a result
he doesn't put pressure on himself in
the short term he doesn't get as
involved in results because he's always
trying to learn and improve some of the
main obstacles that he turned into
opportunities were corvette striking and
the live games ending so to speak and he
went straight online and studied like
crazy he realized wait a second these
live these online games are way tougher
the lower stakes put his eagle to one
side and studied really really hard to
start beating those games rather than
that being a negative thing if we framed
it as a positive thing to learn and
prove and get better during that time as
well he managed to lose 60 pounds and
get himself in great shape and treat his
health and fitness as a main goal again
most people at that time were missing
gym sessions and get out of shape so
again obstacle turned into opportunity
and very often he would back himself to
be able to learn he treats himself as
someone who's got a good memory and he's
a lifelong learner and every time he got
pushed into a corner where he had to uh
learn the online games or change the
situation he would back himself in his
ability to learn and he backed it up
with hard work as well so it wasn't just
like a kind of wishy-washy approach he
put in the work and studied hard to get
through those obstacles another thing i
thought was very interesting was when he
talked about
in vegas losing some money in the live
games some of the biggest stakes and
then coming back to the online games and
you asked them about how challenging
that is to play a lot lower online
compared to live how do you kind of win
the money back so to speak if it quickly
went you've got to forget about winning
it back you've got to forget the mindset
of regaining your losses and that's such
a powerful lesson for poker players
overall forget about winning back it's
all like you're starting fresh on a new
day on a new slate when you're on a
downward swing rather than trying to win
that money back start from a fresh graph
from a fresh perspective i've never
really heard someone see it completely
forget about winning it back because
it's such a normal part of poor
conversation so yeah so many lessons
learned from him there i thought he was
a very a very thoughtful guest and i was
just surprised as well how long it took
him to get from the micro stakes but as
we drilled into it we could see he said
it was laziness his ego but also like
just not knowing what to do just didn't
know how to approach polka but once he
figured it out once he read some books
and got directed all of a sudden he was
off to the races and his skill of
learning started to kick in and he was
able to keep progressing so yeah so many
lessons i could have
expanded but they're the main the main
ones i'll take away from this
conversation how about yourself randy
what was some of the main main lessons
you learned from jared
yeah it wasn't interesting that you
talked about uh in that five years that
he was basically
recreational right he couldn't win that
it had everything to do with he came
there to try to own people's souls right
he saw tom devon do it and he's like
this is what poker is about about making
that fancy fancy play and then basically
the book taught him to listen you should
play solid strategies and then players
make mistakes and you make money right
and now later down his career he did say
that he sometimes throws out some fps uh
i love the hand that he played where he
said like he dunked he re-raised the
river he couldn't really have anything
you know that gets my heart going but he
now knows when to time it right that's a
very big difference also
uh necessity also came back quite often
right when the necessity was there
he would deliver and
he would actually actively look for a
necessity right he would raise in zesty
i read a book once i think it was from
brandon burchard where he talks about
high performance habits and their six
habits and i don't know that one of them
is raising necessity and you could
really see that coming out with jared
so yeah
some other great stuff of course let's
not forget if you want to lose weight
you should exercise and eat healthy
right
there are a couple of very good ones in
there i'll also have some money have a
good bankroll so you don't have to worry
about uh results and also play good
polka i think it's another good lesson
that we got
yeah played well right there was also a
very very good watch a lot of wisdom a
lot of wisdom with jared really great
great player i love to play with him as
well really competent guy
