academy what's up guys welcome to the
wacko show
i'm the wacko we were a little bit in a
rush
okay that's usually
a bad
or at least you know it's something to
take in consideration
let me see he's probably gonna come back
and sit here
indeed
so it's something to take in
consideration
and uh
i get back or get in a little bit hasty
i might uh
yeah it's very likely that you make some
c game mistakes early on that's
something to uh
pay attention to how to become more
successful poker player part two it's
gonna be about
self-awareness going to be a part we're
going to talk about exploitation
managing
your career aka managing your energy
managing your performance managing your
i think i think the software title was
achieving more by working less
and for people who don't know how that
works
well i have not seen the
free webinar
basically i explained poker in that
there's four areas to improve in to
become a more successful poker player
these areas
okay
here you can see self-awareness
population tennessee's adjusting
exploitation that's also what we're
gonna talk about tomorrow
and we're gonna talk about
we already talked about a lot of this
stuff what are we gonna talk about let
me quickly
quickly see
mental game and performance
expectations we talked about that in the
last part was really good
any further questions becoming a more
successful poker player part 3 there we
are
last session we talked about mindset
mentality and perception fundamental
theory and gto expectation reality
management and the feedback loop was a
really good session
and this session
they can recognize the
mental game mistakes i ever gonna talk
about
you know errors in your decision-making
project and indeed finding out what
works for you when to make
i think we're also going to talk about
like
some people have the default to work
more
when they want to achieve something but
sometimes you know that actually has a
reverse effect that's what we're going
to talk about i will finish that uh
wednesday they had something with
charlie seems fun yeah i actually say
actually really looking forward to it
i think we will play 1k he said he
wanted to play between 500 and 5k i mean
500 is just a little bit too low
uh
5k for me would be
too high that's like the highest stake i
currently play six max
and i would say if we would play six mac
if if some people want to play six max
uh
that would be really cool like a four
ended game six max with like some other
twitchers maybe we can set that up after
that uh then for me 2k would be fine but
heads up i mean i think lifestyle played
500 and sets up
so then i said okay let's just make it
1k i think it's a fun steak like i don't
mind you know dropping five to 10 binds
you know i won't survive but if we would
do that on five care today i would as
happy basically
uh and assuming that he has the heads-up
edge youtube guy if you're listening
watching
um
do realize that that's compilations
right on youtube it seems like i flop
sets all the time also obviously every
time you flip a set you highlight it and
we literally named that video with
flopping sets because you know we were
just flopping a little set
didn't
[Music]
interesting turn
i'm gonna mix the turn i think
because the spot where we could mix one
third three quarters we could also just
bet half pot
i think i'm leaning towards just half
potting again
many of you would mix you could probably
bet a little bit more
uh
in this life tournament that i played
there was a there was a part where the
i think it was a televised table at
barcelona
then the guy said uh uh
first of all i think it's it's in my uh
who is the wacko video on youtube i
actually ended with that
and then he says uh
mr coolman is indeed a cool man
and then he also has which then at some
point later on he says like his special
superpower is charisma
apparently uh i have that
um this is ten hands
a big bat he comes out with big dunk
which i think is a good play
definitely a good play
paul
but you know definitely uh incredibly
strong and aggressive play
[Music]
very strong and aggressive play and on
the river it kind of goes both ways if
we want to have a heart yes or no
because yes if you have a heart you know
you block some flushes but you probably
also block his main bluffs which are
gonna be a stem with a sp with a heart
intended heart he blocks the river but
the river block is really
weird to me
seems like
or a low flush or just a bad hand to
bluff with so i hand
like
1080 diamonds or 10 nine
okay so we had the king 10 with the 10
of heart
pretty funny like a single gg poker
streamer
maybe just jack this
because he has nice music and culture i
mean culture is just a legend right
i saw him it was monday aft monday
morning slash afternoon the guy was
zipping half liters of
of beer and had a goose a great
gooseball bottle with him while playing
1k to 5k
i mean that's just
you know
like it's something that i would for
example never do but you know i can
definitely understand why that's uh
it's it's a it's a direction you can go
as a streamer in order to grow
your follower he he does seem very
authentic i believe that he would do
this regardless so let's say for example
he would not be streaming you probably
still do that right
i think that's quite interesting
actually
he just seems that type of guy like i'm
not the type of guy so
you won't expect me to do a stream like
that even though it probably uh i
actually also heard he did a hot tub
stream right does anyone have footage of
that stream because i could definitely
use a clip
now we have actually one contour clip
where he got absolutely cracked or he
just shifted in versus fish because he
was tired of his therapist
on 1k and 2k
as soon as that's the point i'll start
adding gg
because i just want to up my average
stake basically
one is also quite interesting
i don't think we want a bet too big here
maybe half pot could have been good but
i think this is a fine sizing as well
the six falls off
probably bet this sizing number six or
seven and a nine he goes for the check
race which is quite annoying
actually
fault
and play
myself
the chicken sauce
[Music]
pay attention guys we are giving away
over 10k dollar worth of free prizes in

gg doesn't really
appreciate um jet pros i think as he
called them
or i on the other hand i'm
very happy to see chad pros
perfectly fine with me
oh for check raise here with the eights
he's asus sorry
he didn't bite that's unfortunate
go for the delay check race with the
aces
hey i always appreciate it man so anyone
who has opinions about hands or things
and should be played differently you
know
i would just go all the way for the
check race i'm gonna go all the way for
the check race river check race let's go
ah he didn't bite
it queen jack
how didn't he bite
yes they want to play my friends
my good amigos
actually wanna be good this guy's
russian i think right
russians guys
bring on russians i want bring the
russians on bring more russians on
i'm here to get them all
the good para
there's a bit closer i would say
[Music]
i'm gonna go for the check race i tried
this before didn't work
don't really know what to do here gonna
go for the click
i think probably click is an ok play
an interesting spot
at least this is how i perceived it
heads up poker heads up poker heads up
book had some folks
let's draw some 10 percentage and it
works
we're gonna play some 10 20 with the
boys heads up beat
terafox
neverworks if i'm not mistaken when to
play live poke ask him how that went
mopping sets with parker force
how
how was life
poker
cervox
my friend
we should probably continue here
probably low rate frequency race
but that number wasn't high enough
horrible and a lot of fun
sounds like life folk
um
referee check
i guess we just fold
very interesting handbag oh yes i know
to be honest though
it might
sound funky
but this is actually not a terrible hand
compared to all other hands i can have
[ __ ] it
he indeed had the ace king
and that's good for him
so sick
it's so i hate poker so much
oh so till so tilt
so for people who've been paying
attention implemented some new clips we
saw some uh luke's watch today
saw the new helmet clips everyone
everyone is uh obviously everyone is
talking about do a helmet guys
how ironic is it that he runs phil
hellmuth positivity and then he's such a
[ __ ] tale monkey
i mean it can also not be good right i
mean or like i mean
it does give like some commotion but i
guess if you're sponsoring him or
something not really something that i
guess i would be proud of
right
why
why always a [ __ ] age
oh we're done
attack
not gonna bet this board too often
during this step is going to be weird in
terms of if you want to call kings jacks
queens
and make arguments for all sorts of
things
let's see if this pocket kings turns out
better okay this it's a decent scenario
um
[Music]
we have another pocket game here which
i'm gonna forbad
sweden
this kings
i don't think we're very betting the
river
rocket sixes
and flop straight
now [ __ ] it what
dream big quotes
not bad
i don't mind it
i slow play
right three dozer definitely bad freeze
as well deuces as well i think three
nine
fine check
back to the recreational the
recreational bats now this is turning
out to be a good hand
now the question is do we race
there's benefits and downsides both
plays
xf
he better small i think racing is good
but now maybe it's a little bit uh
ah
pretty sure
i can then probably bomb sorry bbb bomb
ah that's not a great tour now is it
no overpair please
oh he just had the king 10. was
completely drawing that
that's a very very very very incredibly
strong and aggressive play
give it to me baby
what the [ __ ]
