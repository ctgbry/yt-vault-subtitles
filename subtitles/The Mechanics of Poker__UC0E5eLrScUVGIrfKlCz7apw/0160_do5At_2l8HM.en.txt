well i guess

[1:09:47]
one of the aha moments

[1:09:51]
let me think for a bit

it's
the minimum defense frequency

[1:10:10]
the minimum defense frequency

[1:10:10]
the minimum defense frequency
so uh

[1:10:14]
let's say yeah i'll describe it real

[1:10:17]
let's say yeah i'll describe it real

[1:10:17]
let's say yeah i'll describe it real
quick so let's say you face a pot-sized
