another high stakes players journey in
today's episode

[01:15]
hi there my fellow poker enthusiast and
welcome back to another episode here on
the mechanics of poker podcast
if you have played online poker chances
are you have faced a russian guy who
seemed to understand the game a little

[01:31]
seemed to understand the game a little
bit better than you did and took all
your money today we are going to talk to
one of them sergey nikiforov aka
munistar will join us on the pot he is a
high stakes online cash game player for

[01:45]
high stakes online cash game player for
over seven years and nowadays plays all
the way up to 100k l so that means that
the big blind is a thousand dollar
that's a lot of money
he has a master's degree in applied
mathematics and physics and has gained
experience playing games pre-poker by

[02:01]
experience playing games pre-poker by
competing in warcraft 3. he told me he
has probably experienced everything a
poker player can go through and agree to
come on our podcast to share what he has
learned throughout his career so you
guys and girls can learn a thing or two

[02:15]
guys and girls can learn a thing or two
and probably try and prevent mistakes
that he has made
adam in your heads up city go times any
russian player that you remember that
kicked your butt
yeah like most people listening i'm sure
you can relate to

[02:30]
you can relate to
russian players who are very good
there's a player that comes to mind
called vbv 1990 he was a very aggressive
russian heads-up synagogue wreck and
yeah he was a nightmare to play against
would always put you in tough spots had
that right balance of aggression but
also not overdoing it and yeah i think

[02:45]
also not overdoing it and yeah i think
the aggressive russian regulars from my
perspective were always on the
aggressive side i didn't play many
passive russian regulars but that could
just be a sample size but there's
obviously a lot of really established
good russian players idea i think their
world's often not spoken about enough

[03:01]
world's often not spoken about enough
and we don't really know as much about
the russian world as we should so
today's guest will be very interesting
hopefully we can understand why the
russians have been so successful in
online poker and live poker and yeah his
journey has been a long one 12 years in
total so lots of stories and lots of

[03:15]
total so lots of stories and lots of
wisdom to share he's playing super super
high nosebleeds right now which we want
to really dig into how he's got there
and also what it's like to play some
high stakes in the game yeah really
excited to see the conversation goes
yeah it was actually similar to the last

[03:30]
yeah it was actually similar to the last
the last podcast we did with jose also
the andorian community always crushes as
well and it's kind of the same with the
russian community it's a bit we don't
really know what's going on there uh so
yeah that's why i was very excited of
jose on the last podcast and now to have
sergion in this podcast

[03:46]
sergion in this podcast
uh for the people that decided to join
the mechanics of poker program we had a
promotion last month went very well a
lot of people decided to join in very
great for that very happy to try to help
you on your journeys
sorry for the other guys that missed out

[04:00]
sorry for the other guys that missed out
but we are working quite hard on the
mechanics of poker 2.0 behind the scenes
which will be released somewhere in
september so keep an eye out on that
without further ado let's get into our
conversation with sergey

[04:15]
conversation with sergey
welcome sergey to the part kakadila
russian for how are you i learned
ah hey guys uh yeah
things are pretty well
yeah i'm currently in thailand and the
weather is fantastic outside

[04:32]
weather is fantastic outside
roughly 30 degrees
so this sign is shining despite
the
um
usually
a little bit rainy at this time of the
year so yeah i'm pretty happy to be on

[04:46]
year so yeah i'm pretty happy to be on
your podcast
yeah i can imagine that thai
it's a tropical culture something
completely different than i think you're
originally from moscow where it gets
what -30 degrees in winter if not more
well it used to be like that a couple of

[05:01]
well it used to be like that a couple of
decades ago however nowadays it's a
little bit more
moderate i would say so minus 20
is uh the lowest temperature that we got
last winter

[05:15]
last winter
long-lived global warming the mod the
people from moscow say like oh minus 20.
great
we we want higher temperatures like that
uh it's actually good weather to play a
lot of online poker maybe this is also a
secret to uh to the russian success in
the online poker streets right minus 20

[05:31]
the online poker streets right minus 20
yeah what else are you gonna do
um well you can do plenty of things for
example i can remember myself playing
football outdoors
when it was -20 so
yeah

[05:45]
yeah
but yeah speaking of online poker yeah
in winter
these are usually the days where you put
largest number of hours in definitely
yeah yeah i i can imagine it's funny how
it's always relative right cold i lived

[06:01]
it's always relative right cold i lived
in rio de janeiro for a while and there
they asked like in the netherlands wow
it got zero degrees do you even go
outside and now you're mentioning minus
20 degrees you go outside to play
football so it's all relative to like
the temperature that you're used to and
what you think is cold uh or hot

[06:16]
what you think is cold uh or hot
um i wanted to start off the pot
poker
you mentioned that you played quite a
lot of warcraft 3 when you were younger
and i was curious was this the first
strategy game you really got into or

[06:30]
strategy game you really got into or
have strategy games always been a big
part of your childhood
um
i guess i played a little bit of chess
when i was a kid like even preschool
i
played

[06:45]
played
against my father but so yeah other than
chassia warcraft 3
was my
first strategy game that i spent a lot
of hours playing
and yeah um i started playing when when

[07:01]
and yeah um i started playing when when
i was
i guess
12 or so
and then
yeah the journey was
maybe
eight years long
so
yeah quite uh quite a significant period

[07:17]
yeah quite uh quite a significant period
of my life i spent playing work on three
did you also compete in in any
tournaments or something like that or
how does it work in warcraft 3
um well initially there was this

[07:32]
matchmaking system
or matchmaking
server that was called battle.net
and so you look in
your account and then you click the

[07:45]
your account and then you click the
search button and then the
system automatically finds you
a rival to compete against right
so that was the early days of my
warcraft 3 let's say career
but afterwards

[08:01]
but afterwards
more and more
online tournaments
began to emerge
and yeah i played
tournaments as well even won a couple of
them
oh nice
you know this were like small
tournaments not nothing major

[08:16]
tournaments not nothing major
so you what was it about
strategy games like work of three you
mentioned a little bit of chess that
intrigued you and that probably still
intrigues you up until today since you
know you still play poker

[08:30]
well um that's a very nice question i
would guess
all of the games that i have played
um
they they gave me an opportunity to

[08:45]
they they gave me an opportunity to
to think a lot so
there was a lot of
wisdom
in terms of the actions you can make
so uh
and probably that complexity of the
games uh

[09:00]
was something that won me over when i
started playing them
so it's like the complexity and then
after after you play the math match to
analyze hey what did he do you're very
very interested in getting better

[09:15]
um
well yeah the analysis was an integral
part of the
warcraft's
career
and
i i can't say that i analyzed every
single game that i played but maybe

[09:31]
single game that i played but maybe
like 20 to 30 percent of the games that
i played were then replayed and
yeah i looked for the
things that i didn't do well
the things that i could have improved in

[09:45]
the things that i could have improved in
and yeah eventually i became stronger
stronger
guys secret to success analyze your
games try to find leaks and improve so
it's it's very similar to poker this is
probably the analytical skills that you
develop maybe through warcraft and

[10:01]
develop maybe through warcraft and
through knowing how to improve this is
probably something that has helped you
in your poker career as well i assume
well yeah um and
another
factor to talk about
that is similar in poker and warcraft

[10:16]
that is similar in poker and warcraft
studying um is that
you really need to put a lot of hours in
in order to
uh to become successful
at a certain level
so uh
you can't
let's say uh start playing and in one

[10:32]
let's say uh start playing and in one
month become a player who can crush the
top regulars in both games right
so you need
quite a bit of patience and
yeah dedication in order to
to achieve some significant results

[10:45]
to achieve some significant results
there
and i guess you really need to enjoy
that process right because as you said
it can take quite a while before you
actually start to win tournaments or
reach the high stakes so in the
meanwhile you really have to enjoy that
process right like you said that it's

[11:01]
process right like you said that it's
difficult and you put your mind to spots
where it really has to think you really
have to enjoy that process i assume
there is no
warcraft 3 solver i mean i could be
wrong here but
like how how how do you then study do
you meet up with other players to do it

[11:17]
you meet up with other players to do it
and share your screen re-watch together
well um
i guess initially the approach was that
trial and error approach
so

[11:30]
so
and as time went on
i reached let's say
a mediocre level
then i started watching the games of the
best players in the world in order to
get an idea what they are doing
that is different

[11:45]
that is different
from what i was doing at that point
and
yeah
you mentioned one thing that there is no
gto
in warcraft 3.
i would guess
there is one guy

[12:01]
there is one guy
probably the best nowadays in warcraft 3
whose name is dmitry kostin aka happy
um
i believe he has found that gto so
uh gtl solution oh wow the gta is the

[12:17]
uh gtl solution oh wow the gta is the
warcraft
do you have any insights in what the gto
solution to warcraft 3 looks like
well i guess he has developed his
strategy
to to an extent that it cannot be
improved further

[12:31]
improved further
so and by
by saying that
uh
i feel that that's the gto of warcraft 3
game
nice did he already play when you were
playing because i assume it as you said

[12:45]
playing because i assume it as you said
right it takes a lot of time so in order
to reach the gto solution in any game
and play it almost perfectly yeah
you need you need to put in a lot of
hours
yeah happy
started his career maybe

[13:01]
started his career maybe
i don't know
four years after i started
and we were able to play against each
other
and
yeah
i guess i i won even a couple of matches
against him
oh wow that that is something to be

[13:15]
oh wow that that is something to be
proud of like oh that happy guy yeah
it's the gto oh no i beat him a couple
times i beat him a couple times for some
reason he he was pretty good uh from the
beginning of his career so for some
reason some reason i don't know what it
was but yeah

[13:31]
was but yeah
maybe he was using an rta on the side
hey you never know
yeah
i don't know
in
there
before you mentioned that around it was
around 2009 you mentioned that you

[13:47]
around 2009 you mentioned that you
started to see poker becoming more
popular on russian tv and you thought
the game was super cool
many of our previous guests mentioned
seeing high stakes poker the you know
the big piles of cash on the table all

[14:01]
the big piles of cash on the table all
the cool characters like ivy dwan sami
farha they really inspired them to
become a professional poker player did
one of these guys you saw on tv inspire
you to become a poker player and was
there someone considered famous in the

[14:16]
there someone considered famous in the
russian community back then that you
could look up to
oh
that's a very tough question to answer
because that
event happened
that event of me watching a poker show

[14:32]
that event of me watching a poker show
on russian tv channels was
uh almost 13 years ago so i do not
recall any names that were playing
in those games um

[14:46]
one name that comes to my mind
is the name of uh
the second place finisher
of 2008 uh wsop main event
um
so the guy's name is i would not know

[15:02]
so the guy's name is i would not know
yeah so the guy's name is ivan denidov
and he's from russia
and guess what
he's a former warcraft 3 player as well
oh wow
yeah so

[15:16]
yeah so
were you aware of that back then in like
2009 that like this guy went from
warcraft to the world series finished
second probably won a couple of million
um
for some reason when i started my career

[15:30]
for some reason when i started my career
i did not know about that that's
happening
however maybe half an hour or sorry half
a year later
i realized that the guy
who was a former warcraft 3 player

[15:45]
who was a former warcraft 3 player
managed to to get seconds in the main
event
so yeah just just a coincidence
you you also mentioned that what
actually really really put you over the
line to to start playing online poker
was that a friend of yours who also

[16:01]
was that a friend of yours who also
played warcraft 3 wow a lot a lot of a
lot of talented worker 3 players
transitioned into poker uh
that
he won the same amount
that you earn by working a month he won
that in just one night so that was

[16:15]
that in just one night so that was
something that really put you over the
edges like oh wow this is possible with
an online game i've been playing work of
three for over eight years have not
really made managed to make any money
out of it but you can just make my
salary in one night
yeah
um

[16:30]
um
i remember that number
one thousand dollars
and that was precisely how much he had
at his account
at that time so he made
a post in his social network

[16:46]
a post in his social network
showing that
showing the screenshot of his cashier
and that really inspired me i started to
um
to get
started doing some research on

[17:01]
started doing some research on
how to get into poker what are the ways
of
uh starting to play the game and
yeah
roughly
in summer 2009
managed to get my free bankroll from

[17:18]
managed to get my free bankroll from
one of the poker sites
and yeah basically
in september i started playing
yeah i can imagine that
you know it's often good if you see

[17:32]
you know it's often good if you see
someone do it and actually succeed
especially i think when they have the
same background as you so this guy
winning the world series your friend did
this encourage you like oh wow they are
basically just like me
they can do it so i can do it as well

[17:47]
they can do it so i can do it as well
did that give you a lot of confidence
um
i would not say it was about confidence
it was about
um
giving it a try

[18:00]
giving it a try
so uh
i thought um i saw real people starting
to make money with poker
and
yeah as you mentioned they were not no
different
from me

[18:15]
from me
and yeah that's well i guess that's uh
another way of um
giving confidence right
so uh
yeah i definitely had
more confidence
uh seeing the results of my friends than

[18:31]
uh seeing the results of my friends than
before
yeah it's like uh if they can do it
why why i can do it especially if you
already kick their ass in warcraft's
like hey
you can do this poker thing then i can
probably do this poker thing as well you
did what were you like your expectations

[18:47]
did what were you like your expectations
going into play poker because he won
your salary in one night it's like okay
he won a thousand dollar in one night
well there's 30 around 30 nights in a
month so i'll make 30k a month what was
that kind of about the math like i can
imagine if you don't know anything about

[19:00]
imagine if you don't know anything about
poker that's kind of how the math goes
in your head
um initially there were no expectations
about the
amount of money that
it was possible to win

[19:15]
it was possible to win
so i just
wanted to try something new
remember i
stopped playing warcraft and at that
point i had quite a bit of free time
left
for myself and i was

[19:31]
for myself and i was
searching for
some hobby and
poker um was
i guess the
number one choice
of finding that new hobby

[19:46]
of finding that new hobby
yeah that's the similarities with
warcraft right you like something to put
your mind to it's a difficult puzzle
you're being challenged you mentioned
that you would do some research in terms
of how to start playing poker any any
research that you remember like some

[20:00]
research that you remember like some
basic strategies that you started out
with
well i remember that uh
poker site that
that gave me
um basically free bankroll and they um

[20:16]
um basically free bankroll and they um
provided some studying materials as well
so initially i started by
basically studying those uh materials on
that website
yeah and that that worked that worked

[20:30]
yeah and that that worked that worked
pretty well
now you immediately due to implementing
these strategies you immediately notice
okay there's quite a lot of skill in the
game
[Music]
i did not think like that at that moment

[20:45]
i did not think like that at that moment
um
i actually thought that uh
considering how
simple the strategies were
everyone could have implemented them and
start winning in poker
and yeah it was well the strategies were

[21:02]
and yeah it was well the strategies were
yeah as i mentioned pretty simple and
they worked they worked so
yeah
so the strategies were pretty simple
but it still intrigued you because from

[21:18]
but it still intrigued you because from
what i'm hearing from you you like a bit
more the complexity uh that for example
that was one of the drivers in work of
three
did them poker after you do kind of
discovered a strategy to win was it like

[21:30]
discovered a strategy to win was it like
oh this is not that hard did it kind of
then lose interest for you or what then
kept you going except for the
for the complexity
obviously it's way more complex we know
now but maybe i guess back then it's
like okay the goals will be money i now

[21:47]
like okay the goals will be money i now
make money
um there were quite a lot of studying
materials at the website that
i mentioned
um
so
once you

[22:01]
go up in stakes
you
had more and more
access to to the new materials
so
the force that was driving me
was to

[22:15]
was to
to learn something new and you
every single day
and
yes so basically that website kept me
busy for maybe um
half of a year or so or maybe one year

[22:31]
half of a year or so or maybe one year
yeah i i i can understand it's like kind
of the gamification right it's like oh i
wanna unlock i wanna i wanna go move up
one level so i can unlock the new
knowledge
um yeah and another thing was that as
you as i moved to

[22:46]
you as i moved to
open stakes
the
simpler strategies
stopped stopped working so i had to
upgrade those strategies in order to be
able to
uh to win money at the next state level

[23:03]
uh to win money at the next state level
and is it
i mean even maybe even up until today is
it that
every time you know you can level up one
more there's new challenge is it
something that intrigued you and keeps
on driving you forward even up until

[23:15]
on driving you forward even up until
today
yeah yeah definitely um
it's been pretty boring for me to say to
stay at the same level so i've always
wanted to

[23:31]
wanted to
move to the next level
and
i know some people
are
um
are playing um the same limits i
every single year of their career

[23:47]
every single year of their career
uh and um i'm just not like that i i
need
more and more sophisticated challenges
to
yeah basically to compete in and

[24:03]
it feels that's just a part of my
personality
well i can definitely uh i can
definitely relate i think
confidence
in your ability that you can actually do

[24:15]
in your ability that you can actually do
it and that even if right now you can't
that you can learn the skills in order
to beat the next level i think that's a
very important thing i think a lot of
players that just stay stuck in their
stake in their comfort zone because deep
down inside they
are maybe a bit afraid that if they

[24:30]
are maybe a bit afraid that if they
would move up on stake that they would
get confronted that they might not be
good enough and that's a certain amount
of uncomfort that they're not willing to
go through so therefore they just stick
within their comfort zone they will make
excuses like ah yeah but i'm making good
money here i can pay my rent stuff like

[24:45]
money here i can pay my rent stuff like
that
so i think
do you do you think that the success
that you had in warcraft 3 helped you
develop that mentality right having
success early seeing that you can make
progress seeing that you can beat other
people did that help you develop that

[25:02]
people did that help you develop that
confidence or do you think that's
something that's just installed inside
of you even before warcraft maybe
beating your dad in chess
yeah you're asking very good questions
um
i'm not sure exactly

[25:17]
i'm not sure exactly
maybe that
that part of me was present even before
warcraft
what i can say for sure is warcraft
helped me to develop it
so maybe if i did not play warcraft 3 i

[25:33]
so maybe if i did not play warcraft 3 i
would not have been able to
achieve as much poker
yeah i'm sure i'm sure has helped if
this helped in in many ways as we
already kind of talked about adam i know

[25:46]
already kind of talked about adam i know
that you played had some cynicals and
there's also clear
like a clear ranking system right you
can always look up to the next level and
i know there's like a little mafia going
on there's a bunch of guys who kind of
control the gates of the next heads up
sit and go levels you kind of knock on

[26:00]
sit and go levels you kind of knock on
their door have to pedal them and then
at some point they're like okay you're
welcome at this stake we kind of share
the fish it's a it's a whole community
this is
every time looking up to the next egg
did was this also a big driver for you
yeah the heads up sit and go kind of

[26:16]
yeah the heads up sit and go kind of
games are very structured towards
getting to the next level and having to
battle your way into that next level so
the same way a computer game you try to
level up be the end boss and go to the
next level the heads of cynical lobbies
are kind of structured so when you get
good enough you start to shot take the

[26:30]
good enough you start to shot take the
level above and keep progressing so yeah
the first four or five years of my
career like a computer game of trying to
get good enough to be the next level and
then you go for a period where you play
the best regulars at the level above you
get the seal of approval well done
you're good enough and then you can kind
of start to share the kind of fish

[26:46]
of start to share the kind of fish
traffic that goes through that level so
yeah very very addictive and also uh
it's a lot of growth goes into that
because you can't even decide like a lot
of players
very quickly decide oh wait a second i'm
just sticking mid sticks because i don't
want to keep progressing because every
time you want to progress you've got to
really go into a vulnerable position but

[27:00]
really go into a vulnerable position but
basically you're going to play tough
opponents you're going to probably lose
money slash break even for a number of
months in order to crack that next level
and that's it someplace just don't want
to sign up for that other players just
like right next level next level so i
think it depends on your mindset if
that's a good fit for you something like

[27:15]
that's a good fit for you something like
mtt's would never have that kind of
structure you can play you're the
bankroll you can play any solo stakes
and there's still enough fish traffic
going freeway you don't have to
necessarily battle them but i think it's
an interesting characteristic of certain
formats and it definitely it definitely
feels like a kind of computer game where

[27:31]
feels like a kind of computer game where
you're trying to get to next level which
is super interesting
i want to jump into the storyline
basically it took you uh about seven
years to get to high stakes and you
started back in 2009 and you mentioned
that you've probably gone through
everything an online poker player a good
face and i'm going to assume that from

[27:46]
face and i'm going to assume that from
2009 so 2016 it didn't go in a straight
line and just
all the way to the top so what are some
of the things that you struggled with
being a professional poker player
especially in the early years maybe the
first two or three years what's the
things that were difficult for you

[28:00]
well first of all i
have to mention that um
i started from a different discipline
that i play now
so while now i play uh
caged games
um 100 big blinds and up initially i

[28:17]
um 100 big blinds and up initially i
played cap games which have which which
had like
20 big blinds
buying
so uh
the first
i believe three years
i dedicated

[28:31]
i dedicated
towards playing cap games and direct
the highest stakes in cup games and then
for some reason i became bored
so
what i decided to do is to
restart my career

[28:46]
restart my career
and i moved down to
15l
in order to learn that
real cash giving poker
so uh yeah speaking of struggles

[29:00]
so uh yeah speaking of struggles
i guess the main struggle that i've had
during those years
was
my desire to play more and more
so
instead of

[29:16]
instead of
quitting the session
when my conditions were
far from ideal i kept playing and
playing
and i would imagine that cost me a lot
of money both

[29:30]
of money both
in cap games and
later in
like regular cash games
so yeah it's
it takes quite a bit of discipline to
um
just
to leave the table especially if the if

[29:46]
to leave the table especially if the if
the game is very good
so uh
um it's it's definitely
a mental
leak that i had at that time like a
mental game leak

[30:00]
mental game leak
and
yeah i can say that i've been working on
it um
yeah for the last
i don't know 10 to 12 years and i'm
still working on it
so how have you been able to make
progress with that let's say it sounds
like you're somebody who

[30:15]
like you're somebody who
just wants to play a lot and this can
lead you to play it sub-optimal and play
too long in certain periods so for you
like is there any sort of limitations
you create for yourself do you check in
with yourself to go right right now i'm
feeling a bit burnt out a bit tired is
there any kind of safety nets or
boundaries you put in place for yourself

[30:31]
boundaries you put in place for yourself
to stop yourself playing too much
um well i guess
the most important thing that i did was
uh journaling
so after every single session i played i

[30:46]
so after every single session i played i
put a grade
at
how how i felt about my game in that
session maybe in
in once one month's time i had this
basically i had grades for every single

[31:00]
basically i had grades for every single
session that i played throughout the
month
and you know during the months you can
have
as many as maybe 40 sections played
so that's quite quite a significant
sample size
and by analyzing that data

[31:17]
and by analyzing that data
you can deduce
how the session lens impacts the your
the quality of your of your game
and then i realized that
at some point my game becomes so bad

[31:32]
at some point my game becomes so bad
that i'm no longer profitable even at
the best tables that i play
so
yeah i found that sweet spot in terms of
the session lens
that
i do not

[31:45]
i do not
need to cross
in order to stay profitable
and yeah
since then
it became only a matter of
being disciplined enough to
quit the tables once that

[32:01]
quit the tables once that
time has passed
i love this as a performance coach this
really lights me up this topic and yeah
it sounds like what happened there was
you basically brought some
awareness to what was happening and you
used that via tracking so every session
you would grade your performance and it

[32:15]
you would grade your performance and it
became very obvious quantitatively with
numbers that certain session lens were
almost like diminished returns and would
go negative and then once you saw that i
think poker players are very good once
they see data on something it responded
to that data when there's no data it's
like oh don't play as long it's very

[32:31]
like oh don't play as long it's very
kind of fluffy but when you get numbers
on it you can see over 40 sessions a
month that your five longer sessions
were also your lowest graded sessions
you started wait a second these long
sessions aren't doing me much good so
now i've got the data to back it up and
like i said then it becomes a discipline

[32:45]
like i said then it becomes a discipline
can i stick to a certain session length
that is optimal for me an optimal
strategy in terms of session and yeah
i'm sure you face that that each to want
to play i know players who have this the
same kind of problem that you're having
they just want to play it comes from a
really nice place at the same time that

[33:01]
really nice place at the same time that
desire to want to play sometimes yeah
leads you to play times you shouldn't so
yeah i think of that day that's really
powerful so anyone who's watching this
who's over playing do exactly what
sergey said there and yeah basically
track your grade your performance for
your sessions and see with data where

[33:15]
your sessions and see with data where
your sessions drop off from the
diminished returns points for session
length where you want to be aware of i
want to quickly touch on you
transitioning formats so it sounds like
you basically got to the highest stakes
in cap in the first two or three years
and then you transitioned to real cash

[33:30]
and then you transitioned to real cash
games and you almost started again from
like 50 nl so from a mindset perspective
that's very interesting because you've
built up a skill set and you've become
very good at a format and even though
you might see more opportunities in
regular cash games it's very hard to go

[33:45]
regular cash games it's very hard to go
back to being a kind of more low stakes
player and to learn that format again so
for you did you find any challenges
taking on new formats having to drop
levels was there any anything any
conflict you had to overcome to
transition to a law stake

[34:01]
it was quite tough
in the beginning
because
well i knew a lot
about cap games and i had
those um well ideas and strategies
memorized

[34:16]
memorized
and transitioning to
a 100 big blinds poker
was was not an easy thing to do so i had
to
rewire my brain
to some extent because some of the

[34:31]
to some extent because some of the
concepts from the cap games were not
working apparently
so uh
yeah i guess uh the best the best thing
that worked for me
was finding uh poker fellows that

[34:46]
was finding uh poker fellows that
played
um
the same stakes that that i did at that
time
and we started um our studying journey
together
so that's that quote uh that helped uh

[35:00]
so that's that quote uh that helped uh
quite a bit during that time
yeah awesome so for you uh progressing
from low stakes to mid stakes i find for
a lot of players is one of the biggest
jumps in poker so for you what were some
of the things that you changed either on
off the tables that allowed you to

[35:15]
off the tables that allowed you to
transition like from the lower stakes to
the mid stakes especially at the regular
cash games so you mentioned you've got
other players who you're studying with
what were some of the other changes that
you had to make on the tables to
to get into mistakes
by meet stakes so what stakes do you

[35:30]
by meet stakes so what stakes do you
mean
let's call it 100 nl to 500 you know
okay
um
oh i guess it was just a matter of

[35:46]
oh i guess it was just a matter of
sufficient bankroll
so uh
when i started playing 15l i had
1500 dollars
in my microshare
and then

[36:02]
i guess i moved
to next stakes when i had 30 buyings of
the of the new limits
so uh uh speaking of uh

[36:15]
so uh uh speaking of uh
what helped me to transition
i guess i
i've learned a lot from watching watts
[Music]
oh probably at that time i had hired my

[36:32]
oh probably at that time i had hired my
first coach
and
he actually
did not help me initially because
he
his studying approach was

[36:47]
his studying approach was
quite different
from everyone else's
uh
does the name matthew janda tell you
anything
yes
so in fact he was my
first

[37:01]
first
theory coach
and
you know it was a pre-solver era so no
one really knew what gto was at that
time
and janda had his own perspective
on how gto should look like

[37:17]
on how gto should look like
and in retrospect i can say that
his view was uh quite a bit off
so uh i basically started learning wrong

[37:31]
so uh i basically started learning wrong
theory well not strong theory but
um
the theory that was
a little bit off
and while other players were
learning by uh

[37:46]
learning by uh
i guess watching video on demand
or
trial and error approach
i was learning mathematical concepts
so
that were a little bit off

[38:02]
that were a little bit off
so that's that was definitely a struggle
um
and once uh janda started to
tweak his uh
well strategy and studying approach

[38:15]
well strategy and studying approach
um things started to make more and more
sense
and i guess that's
what
helped me at that time to
uh to progress to move from 100 to noah
to like
mistakes

[38:31]
mistakes
yeah what was it that made you seek a
coach at that stage were you struggling
with strategy was there a lot of
unanswered questions
why did you feel like at that time
period you reached out to seek a coach
uh do you remember i talked to you i
told you about that

[38:46]
told you about that
poker studying website
that gave me the free bankroll so at
some point
i really
stopped liking their approach
because they were presenting some

[39:00]
because they were presenting some
information without
really
explaining it
so i had to take those facts for granted
and apply them without understanding why
i have to play like uh the article
dictates me to play

[39:16]
dictates me to play
so and i started for uh
doing research of the coaching markets
and
yeah i wanted something

[39:30]
maybe unique
that
other players did not
use at the time
and that's why i
talked to mate you
and
yeah
that started

[39:45]
that started
our cooperation
it seems like there's an element of
curiosity there built in for you and you
started to see that the strategy you
were using told you what to do what
behind the strategy but not necessarily
the why and you want to go deeper and
find more advanced strategies that led

[40:01]
find more advanced strategies that led
you to see coaches that may be new
things that you didn't know i found it
interesting that the coaching experience
to begin with didn't work out very well
because the strategy wasn't exactly a
good fit for you at that time but you
stuck with it and the strategy evolved i

[40:15]
stuck with it and the strategy evolved i
think sometimes when we're trying to
learn it doesn't go in a kind of abc
manner we have to take on more
information sometimes things get
confusing for a while we'll miss apply
things we'll learn things in the wrong
way but it's all part of that learning
process and you've got to almost like
put yourself out there and basically

[40:30]
put yourself out there and basically
take on new information new perspectives
in order to come to your own kind of
conclusions so for you when you had a
coach at this periods were you kind of
following the coach's lead in terms of
strategy and when did you start to
develop your own strategy or sort of
think for yourself i would say the
coaching environment

[40:48]
um
yeah i definitely was following his
ideas
well at least initially
and
yeah i found myself
in situations

[41:01]
in situations
that
basically did not
did not align with the ideas that the
coach was presenting
and i was
starting to

[41:16]
starting to
uh
to realize that
the strategy and the theory that matthew
was
coaching me
was probably not

[41:30]
was probably not
not the best strategy that works
um
worked at the worked in the environments
that i was playing
so
and that's why
i feel that
cooperation with other fellow poker

[41:46]
cooperation with other fellow poker
players helped me a lot because we were
able to
discuss
how let's say
a given situation is played in the real
poker on the real poker table not in

[42:00]
poker on the real poker table not in
theory
and
yeah we basically had three opinions
and uh it's easier to come
to a good conclusion once you have three
opinions and not just once not just one
yes it sounds like a very good peer

[42:16]
yes it sounds like a very good peer
group who are playing the same games as
you where you could take the kind of
theory you were learning and you could
run it through your kind of peer group
of is this working in practice what are
you guys thinking this is what i'm
saying what's happening in this in real
life practice of these games i think
it's always a very important step where

[42:31]
it's always a very important step where
when you're learning theory you've got
to think how does that theory apply to
the exact games i'm playing see i think
it's really good that you've got other
players who you could do that with and
for you do you feel like you've been
quite a self-directed learner throughout
your career so you talk about seeking a
coach you talk about your peer group do

[42:46]
coach you talk about your peer group do
you feel like you're always looking for
more information trying to find a
different peer group or more information
to access have you always been directing
your own learning in that way

[43:00]
yeah i feel
it was always not enough for me
so apparently
we know nowadays that poker is a very
complicated game
and
it even started to feel that way uh 10

[43:16]
it even started to feel that way uh 10
years ago
so
yeah
always i was always
searching for new information
and while i was not
trying to get into
other

[43:30]
other
um studying groups since i thought that
um our
well three-person group was
enough for studying
i actively looked for
getting information from the web

[43:46]
getting information from the web
so there were some
learning sites like
maybe you recall there was one site
called card runners
gunners.com or something like that
and yeah some of the

[44:02]
and yeah some of the
popular high-stakes players at the time
posted
videos there and yeah i was i was amazed
for instance by
um
it was probably sauce sauce one two

[44:16]
it was probably sauce sauce one two
three four
or six one two three i don't recall the
name exactly
so yeah some of the videos there were
yeah fantastic
and they they really inspired me to
uh to keep going to keep studying to

[44:30]
uh to keep going to keep studying to
keep learning new stuff
um yeah other than strategy that you
were evolving with did you run into any
mindset leaks during that period i know
when you're going from like low stakes
to mid stakes very often the money
starts becoming real and all of a sudden
you can actually do lots of stuff with

[44:45]
you can actually do lots of stuff with
the money that you're making which
wasn't the case in your career and
sometimes players like limit themselves
when they're starting to see the
cashiers going um in the right direction
but it was anything that limited you and
you're going to mistakes in terms of any
mental blocks you ran into or any leaks
that you had to overcome

[45:02]
um yeah i guess
i can think of a couple of leaks
that that were at that time
um
so

[45:15]
so
as i mentioned i started learning theory
so
and you know the theory usually dictated
certain ways to how to play
play certain spots
and
i was

[45:31]
i was
so fixed with this mindset of playing
playing the sport only in one possible
way that it was hard for me to
to think freely
and

[45:46]
and
maybe use
another line to play the spots
or to use like another bed sizing
so the theory was
so deeply
ingrained in my brain that uh

[46:01]
ingrained in my brain that uh
it was pretty tough to
to find that wisdom of um like
playing playing as uh as you want
um
yeah you mentioned one thing about

[46:17]
yeah you mentioned one thing about
money's
uh starting matter
when you start playing your mid stakes
well i do not recall my feelings at that
time

[46:31]
time
i can say that
the money in cashier has been
well simply the numbers for the
um significant part of my career

[46:45]
um significant part of my career
i tried to follow
the bankroll management approach pretty
well
and
by doing so i was able to limit my
losses
and
well basically not to have that uh

[47:02]
well basically not to have that uh
mental leak of
scared money if you can say like that
yeah i think it's something that the
first thing you said about having the
fixed theory strategy i think a lot of
players will be struggling with this

[47:15]
players will be struggling with this
right now on the g2 gto era where
everyone's learning theory from solvers
it's sometimes a brave move to deviate
strategy and sometimes it feels safer
just to be rigid do what the solver does
and it takes like a lot of confidence in
yourself to uh go against what is kind

[47:30]
yourself to uh go against what is kind
of what the theory's saying so you can
freely apply your adaptive or exploitive
strategies in game and yeah i think uh
sounds like you were struggling at one
stage of your career to allow yourself
to express yourself to uh make creative
players and you're sticking a bit too
rigidly to the theory so yeah i'm sure a

[47:45]
rigidly to the theory so yeah i'm sure a
lot of players watching might be going
for that same but right now so for you
when you were transitioning out of that
and allowing yourself to have a more
adaptive strategy how would you approach
that how did you allow yourself not to
be so fixed to the theory

[48:00]
well to be honest i am
still a little bit uh fixed in terms of
how i play
so
but i've i've made some progress
throughout the years
so uh
i guess

[48:16]
i guess
one of my main breakthroughs
throughout my career was that
i realized that
you can
play against every single opponent
differently that is on the table

[48:30]
differently that is on the table
not play your strategy
but play
let's say five different strategies
against five opponents that are your are
at your six next table
and uh yeah basically
um

[48:45]
um
opening your mind for that idea
really allowed me to
to experiment a lot with my game
because whenever you try to exploit
someone
you
[Music]
you are forced to go out of your comfort

[49:02]
you are forced to go out of your comfort
zone and play of playing that fixed
strategy and you are obligated to play
differently against various types of
opponents
um
yeah i guess that that's what helped me
with that regards

[49:16]
with that regards
awesome perfect so renee you're anything
but a fixed strategy kind of guy if
anything you come from the extremes of
exploits and you've had to put more
theory into your game to kind of balance
that how do you think that's been
different from your experience when you
were playing mistakes from a more free

[49:31]
were playing mistakes from a more free
strategy and having to
learn fixed strategies later on how was
that different for you
i think the biggest
trouble or struggle that players have
who didn't come from a theory background
i was pure exploitative and then like i

[49:46]
i was pure exploitative and then like i
think around 1k 2k i would always
stagnate
surprise surprise i did i need to learn
some theory uh but obviously
i think this has been talked about quite
often like that you need to know
understand what is correct in order to

[50:00]
understand what is correct in order to
identify what someone is doing wrong so
i thought people were doing something
wrong that wasn't wrong so i was making
exploits on them that were actually not
exploited i was just exploiting myself i
think that's a quite a common struggle
and also what do you do if you have no
information so i'm against someone who i
don't know i have no baseline because

[50:16]
don't know i have no baseline because
every strategy would be created on the
fly versus how i think my opponent plays
but if i don't know anything i'm like
i'm clueless if my heart is not on i'm
like i cannot play poker because your
decision making is all around that i
have no theoretical baseline

[50:31]
have no theoretical baseline
so
also what would happen is you would
suffer a lot in playing volume because
every time you have to create a strategy
from scratch in every spot that you get
in
uh so yeah that that that prevents you
from playing a lot of volume because
it's very mental fatiguing so i think

[50:47]
it's very mental fatiguing so i think
having a certain theory base to play
from right that in generally is going to
work and then from there indeed exploit
based on certain opponent tendencies
that is the way to go that's what i
found out uh later on in my career

[51:03]
found out uh later on in my career
it was also interesting
what sergey mentioned in terms of the
theory and you also pointed that out
that i think a lot of players now
struggle with that with solvers uh he
struggled it with the theory that
matthew agenda taught him but people now

[51:15]
matthew agenda taught him but people now
often struggle with solvers that they're
trying to
they're being taught what to do without
understanding it but i think the main
thing that i always teach students is
that they have to start to think in
terms of what are you trying to achieve
with your hand okay the theory is there

[51:31]
with your hand okay the theory is there
because it achieves a certain thing you
have to understand what it's trying to
achieve and then you have to go into the
table that you're playing against and as
i said you pointed out they play
differently so we have our default
strategy which usually achieves what we
want it to achieve

[51:46]
want it to achieve
it generates the most tv but versus
other players we might achieve the same
thing by taking a different line
when you started
i assume that
do you relate with this certainty what
i'm saying

[52:00]
i'm saying
yeah yeah definitely i've had
multiple poker fellows throughout my
career that i worked with
and
that's
that was as especially

[52:16]
that was as especially
obvious
in the earlier parts of my career when
people
just were doing things like betting
checking raising blah blah blah
without realizing what they wanted to
accomplish as you mentioned renee

[52:33]
accomplish as you mentioned renee
so they were just
doing that for some reason and i guess
the most
common reason at that point was that
the guy
in the video did the same and it worked

[52:46]
in the video did the same and it worked
that's why i'll try to do to do it
myself
uh so yeah i guess
digging deep in the
our reasons
for for every single action that you

[53:01]
for for every single action that you
take uh and the poker table
is uh is the way to go nowadays
how did your
enjoyment in playing poker change after
you kind of break free from that theory
and kind of were like oh my mind is now

[53:15]
and kind of were like oh my mind is now
opened up for all these possibilities
how did your enjoyment for the game
change after that
i guess
there are
or there have been three periods in my
poca career in terms of how they related

[53:31]
poca career in terms of how they related
to enjoyment
so there was this first period
when i
just started learning theory and had
this fixed mindset
then i had
the second period
where i started

[53:47]
where i started
thinking more openly
so apparently i had more enjoyments
because i was not
constrained with the actions that i had
to make
and it feels that nowadays i am

[54:00]
and it feels that nowadays i am
a little bit fixed
again because people started playing
fixed strategies
um for the most part so
and i guess the the best way to beat
them is to play like a solid strategy
yourself

[54:15]
yourself
so
unfortunately nowadays
there is not much room for maneuvering
at the highest stakes
so
and it sounds a little bit sad so i
would rather
go back let's say five years ago and

[54:31]
go back let's say five years ago and
play there rather than play
in the current environment
yeah i i feel you there it's it's just
so much nicer when people deviate
because then if you
it feels a little bit more if you make a
good exploit and you create a good

[54:46]
good exploit and you create a good
strategy that plays into his weakness
it you really feel like you deserved it
right whereas if you just try to play
you know your solid strategy plays
historic strategy in the end we'll see
who wins it's more like yeah okay
yes obviously we had an impact on this

[55:00]
yes obviously we had an impact on this
but it doesn't feel as good as really
exploiting someone right
um yeah yeah to a certain extent
you know this gto strategies are
sometimes
quite boring

[55:15]
quite boring
when you are implementing them
so yeah there is actually one name that
uh
i can
can share that
um
that you can have fun playing against

[55:33]
i share that nowadays yeah sure uh well
you you know him uh his name is stefan
so that guy is everything but gto
so he plays uh

[55:46]
so he plays uh
very unorthodox style it has very
unorthodox
um
sizings
ranges
uh batching frequencies
so
if you wanna play the
exploit game go play against him if you

[56:02]
exploit game go play against him if you
are good enough then yeah okay so but i
like to play the exploit game versus
guys who i beat right because that's the
nice feeling like the feeling i guess
you have when you play against stefan is
you're just clueless what's going on i
remember it was an episode with clenty

[56:16]
remember it was an episode with clenty
we did where he also mentioned he played
heads up against stefan and he saw three
button opening sizings and some of them
included an immediate three-time spot
over bet on the flop and he was like
okay
and basically one out of ten hands would

[56:30]
and basically one out of ten hands would
end up with stefan putting his stack in
the middle and he was just like okay i
have no clue what's going on here but
i'm this is too far off my comfort zone
i'm out
is that kind of the feeling you get like
how do you defend yourself against
something like that
um

[56:45]
um
i wish i knew the strategy how to defend
verso
and i'm very surprised that quantity
mentioned that only one out of ten hands
uh ended up
it was it a passive day
yeah yeah yeah
so wow i i haven't well i actually have

[57:02]
so wow i i haven't well i actually have
played stefan heads up a little bit
maybe
a couple of thousand times and yeah it
was precisely like that
constant pressure
constant large sizes everywhere

[57:16]
constant large sizes everywhere
and yeah
it's it's very tough it's very tough i'm
pretty sure that you
it is beatable
however you really need to have your
homework done before the match in order
to succeed

[57:30]
to succeed
and yeah because you you need to know
what to expect and you need to prepare
for that because else you would just be
overwhelmed by what you're facing i
guess
yeah yes so we are we are all human
beings and it's
it's mentally very tough to play uh

[57:45]
it's mentally very tough to play uh
especially long
sessions against stefan because it's
he is in his comfort zone you are not
so the longer you play uh the tougher it
gets for you
what what have you learned by playing
against stefan or

[58:01]
against stefan or
observing stefan play that you can add
to your own game
you talked about like a little bit of
the unpredictability and trying to
maneuver people in a part of the tree
that you know
what's going on and they don't

[58:16]
well i guess
she does not have the word
restriction in his arsenal so
he can basically do whatever

[58:30]
he can basically do whatever
comes to his mind
so
i guess
the main thing we can learn from him is
how to be open about your strategy
and not
not try to be

[58:45]
not try to be
fixed with your
like um
comfort zone lines sizes sizes and
frequencies
yeah i like i like i like the question
why not people often you know they stay

[59:00]
why not people often you know they stay
within line but yeah why not do this why
not and then come up with if you can if
you can't come up with good enough
reasons why not maybe maybe try it but
it's easy to look at it now right now
that he's you know at the top but i
remember and maybe you remember as well
playing against him

[59:15]
playing against him
in 2016 17
ah
just just come complete spew i mean you
could argue that some things are still
complete spew because like the line
between spew and genius
yeah it's it's quite a thin line so
maybe there he was already very good

[59:31]
maybe there he was already very good
back then i i just didn't understand it
but i remember also in terms of his
results he would move up move down
it wasn't very consistent and i think
over the years he has kind of filtered i
guess
the most pure part out and it became

[59:47]
the most pure part out and it became
more to the line of genius but
for people not to be mistaking that this
is just you know how he's always been
right
well definitely um
he has not
been like that throughout his career

[1:00:01]
been like that throughout his career
like he is now
so
he has been experimenting a lot
with uh with his strategy with how
how his opponents play against him

[1:00:15]
how his opponents play against him
and it feels that nowadays he has found
his sweet spot
um
and he has also found
ways to deviate
and

[1:00:30]
and
i'm pretty sure that he
he adjusts to every single opponent he
plays against
and i can't say that
every regular that i play
have that in their arsenal
so

[1:00:45]
so
i guess being able to adjust
against
every other regular and every spot
you are in is
is a very important skill
that uh the top players could have

[1:01:03]
yeah and that that makes it also a bit
more difficult because you can analyze
stefan but if stefan bases
his game on your game analyzing stefan
obviously it will help you into a degree
it's probably better to analyze yourself

[1:01:16]
it's probably better to analyze yourself
than go into the head of stefan and
think about if i was stefan how would i
play this his style against me but i
mean now now we're at uh yeah we're
getting at quite a difficult level
let me ask you one question
um

[1:01:30]
um
how many times do you think i analyzed
stefan's game throughout my career
how many times
uh i don't know uh
30 times
um
not quite as many just five times

[1:01:48]
not quite as many just five times
i mean i i just went for a high number
because the way you framed the question
still five times is quite a lot
well i have not analyzed anyone else uh
that many times
so and guess what happened uh

[1:02:00]
so and guess what happened uh
he's still like a level or a couple of
hell levels ahead of me
well that's my uh
uh that's my feel and i guess things
also changed the second time you
analyzed third time's ms hey he changed
it what what's happening

[1:02:17]
it what what's happening
yeah
so uh
it basically happened the following way
uh i played against him and then he
disappeared for for a certain period and
then he came back with a different
strategy

[1:02:30]
strategy
and i had no idea
how to deal with that and i had to
analyze him once again and then he
disappeared again
but this is this is this is so cool
about poker once you open up your mind
right because there's many
strategic approaches that you can take

[1:02:46]
strategic approaches that you can take
if you if you play around in a solver
and you give it a certain parameter it
will still come up with a solid strategy
for that parameters so what you could
basically do is one week you will play
this strategy
for example you play in position as an
issue ratio let's say one week you play
over bet check and the other week you

[1:03:01]
over bet check and the other week you
play one third only
if i did play against you it's like okay
yeah which the wacko will show up sergey
is like i have no clue he always comes
up with this over bet oh he now throws
out the one third
what does this mean is it on the board

[1:03:16]
what does this mean is it on the board
no it's just random based on the week
let's say you have four game plans for
every week of the month yeah
that's what we are i'm just being
open-minded here i'm just being
yeah
that would be quite tough to play
against you you mentioned that uh

[1:03:32]
against you you mentioned that uh
teaming up with other players has had a
big impact on your career
i love the quote the bigger the dream
the more important the team which
basically incentivizes you should
probably work together if you want to
try to reach the top do you still

[1:03:46]
try to reach the top do you still
remember
like a moment where it really clicked
for you you mentioned you transitioned
away from metro janus theory this was
probably also because you started to
work together with these other players
that were in the same environment as you
do you still remember something that

[1:04:01]
do you still remember something that
really clicked for you back then when
you studied together with these guys
well i guess
we started
basically sharing our opinions uh on the

[1:04:16]
basically sharing our opinions uh on the
on the spot we are discussing
and
those were not their opinions based on
theory they were the opinions based on
the the experience that
each of one had had at the tables

[1:04:31]
each of one had had at the tables
so uh
and yeah as i mentioned um
having those three opinions if they all
sounded the same
then it's pretty likely that they they
they were correct

[1:04:45]
they were correct
and
if uh let's say one of us
had a different perspective on how to
play that spot
that's where we
started uh digging deep in the dynamics
of that spot in order to to find the

[1:05:01]
of that spot in order to to find the
real truth about how
how the spot should be played
how did uh a strategy session between
the three of you look like did you guys
actually like study a specific topic
together would you just go over hands

[1:05:15]
together would you just go over hands
how would that go
um we
did not this was pre-solver age right
yeah yeah definitely
um
so basically
every one of us prepared um

[1:05:32]
every one of us prepared um
a certain number of hands for the
session and we discussed them
um and afterwards if we had some
[Music]
conflicting ideas
we worked on our own in order to

[1:05:49]
to figure out
uh which uh
which point of view was correct
uh for example
let's say you have a situation where you

[1:06:00]
let's say you have a situation where you
uh face an over bet on the river in a
certain spot let's say a person bad flop
that turned and over battered
and
you have conflicting opinions
on this
situation
then you can what you can do is you can

[1:06:15]
then you can what you can do is you can
go
analyze your database filter out for all
similar spots
and get
a sample size
and let's say you see that
five of the ten over bets that you faced

[1:06:32]
five of the ten over bets that you faced
and
that went to showdown showed that a
person was bluffing
then
it is pretty likely that
this spot
is bluffable from your opponents and on

[1:06:46]
is bluffable from your opponents and on
the contrary let's say that only one out
of 10
situations
show the bluff
then it's pretty likely
that
this spot is under blocked

[1:07:01]
this spot is under blocked
and now take into consideration that you
have
three people in that
in that group
that means that you have three times as
much sample
size on those spots
uh

[1:07:15]
uh
well basically to do some research on
yeah so basically what you're saying is
you guys have an opinion or an intuition
and you're using data to confirm or
deny this intuition to kind of get a a
more accurate intuition of what the poo

[1:07:32]
more accurate intuition of what the poo
is actually doing right that's not
biased based on only your view because
you're doing it with three others and
not on three others for you because
you're double checking it with data
yeah yeah definitely
it's like with grading your sessions

[1:07:48]
it's like with grading your sessions
uh
once they are completed as
adam mentioned
it's a pretty
good thing for your brain to see the
real data that shows you that if you

[1:08:00]
real data that shows you that if you
play five hours long five hour five hour
long sessions it is bad for your results
it's an objective data
you can't uh deny it
so uh
yeah and same applies for

[1:08:15]
yeah and same applies for
uh analyzing
um
and history
yeah especially nowadays write the the
whole coaching and
stables around working with data and
constructing strategies around data has

[1:08:30]
constructing strategies around data has
become quite popular mainly for these
reasons right yeah data doesn't doesn't
really lie and obviously sometimes
there's an exception but i think
if you then allow yourself to always
look for the exceptions your bias will
then show and you will find more
exceptions than are actually present

[1:08:48]
exceptions than are actually present
that's kind of the the downside of it
you also mentioned that you loved to
watch videos carter on the cv i was a
big cartoonist with you as well do you
remember what was the guy raptor with
his raptor bats he was quite right about

[1:09:01]
his raptor bats he was quite right about
that he would always stream at the
position he said i distributed position
but i think it was like ridiculous 25 or
something because 63 suited for example
was in there so we're reaching quite
high percentages and then he would
follow it up with a raptor bet he said
which was just like a 20 potsy bed or

[1:09:16]
which was just like a 20 potsy bed or
something
strategically approved nowadays so that
was definitely something that uh
that lasted you mentioned sauce
were there's was there do you remember
some of the aha moments you got from
watching some of these videos and how

[1:09:31]
watching some of these videos and how
did the way you approach poker after
studying with these guys watching this
video change how
how did you think different through
hands after
accumulating this information
well i guess

[1:09:47]
one of the aha moments
let me think for a bit
uh do you remember the
concept of one minus alpha

[1:10:00]
so um
for our viewers who do not
know that
it's
the minimum defense frequency
so uh
let's say yeah i'll describe it real

[1:10:17]
let's say yeah i'll describe it real
quick so let's say you face a pot-sized
bed on the river
and
your opponent's range consists of um
nuts and air nuts and blobs and the

[1:10:30]
nuts and air nuts and blobs and the
orange consists of blocking blockages so
in order to make your opponent's blasts
different you have to
defend
uh 50 of your range if you're facing
upon that
so
this idea of the minimum defense

[1:10:47]
this idea of the minimum defense
frequency was
initially extrapolated to earlier
streets
to turn
flop and even preflop
and as we know nowadays
it's not true on the flop

[1:11:01]
it's not true on the flop
it is especially not true if the ranges
are
very asymmetric asymmetrical
if one range has a significant advantage
over other
the defense the optimal defense

[1:11:15]
the defense the optimal defense
frequency is way
lower than this minimum defense
frequency
and
so speaking of the aha moments that
i found in source videos

[1:11:32]
i found in source videos
um
remember i was uh
um
studying
a theory with matthew janda yeah he he
was very much about that why
is all fussed off right
yeah yeah definitely

[1:11:46]
yeah yeah definitely
and i took uh
the ranges
and i always
tried to found to find that
borderline hand to defend
and
as you might imagine

[1:12:01]
as you might imagine
it is usually quite a weak hand in your
range
a weak and a very not obvious hand
so
i did not recognize those plays in
sources videos

[1:12:16]
sources videos
and
in fact he was folding
a little bit more than i was folding
during that time
and i guess the fact that you that you

[1:12:30]
and i guess the fact that you that you
do not have to defend those weak hands
was
well if not a big breakthrough
but definitely
a huge boost in terms of uh
my win rate and in terms of

[1:12:46]
my win rate and in terms of
the confidence in my game
because
i was doing those marginal plays
on earlier streets and they never really
worked
and by simply eliminating them i started
to get more enjoyment and more

[1:13:03]
to get more enjoyment and more
more confidence in the place in my
overall strategy that i was implementing
at that time
yeah i'm gonna quote you there you said
have to i have to do this that kind of

[1:13:15]
have to i have to do this that kind of
you you were in this phase your career
you're kind of breaking free from that i
don't have to do anything okay i can
just do what i have to go to to go back
to the staff on the staff on error right
now i just do whatever i want and you
deal with it right that's kind of the
the the

[1:13:30]
the the
the yeah sort of the new approach i was
never
theory oriented mathematically oriented
so i would always just be like it's it
was very feeling based like listen i
just don't see good things happening
with this hand in this situation that's
more how i would then approach it and

[1:13:46]
more how i would then approach it and
probably when you were playing like you
probably also had that feeling right
because as you said it never worked out
with those hands
but there was kind of a conflict between
what your gut was telling you and what
your brain was telling you like ah but i
have to but your gut was saying yeah but

[1:14:00]
have to but your gut was saying yeah but
this isn't working so i guess you felt
really relieved after that
especially again if you have someone
like sauce showing you like oh wow sauce
he's a very good player and he doesn't
even do this [ __ ] this i'm free now
yeah yeah definitely and adam asked

[1:14:15]
yeah yeah definitely and adam asked
about
um
mental leaks that i had earlier in my
career and
yeah you know this rivalry uh between
having to do
something that
the theory dictated and

[1:14:31]
the theory dictated and
uh
that action
not really working
yeah that was very huge at uh earlier
stages of my career and that
worried me quite a bit because i thought

[1:14:46]
worried me quite a bit because i thought
that i was not
understanding something i was not
doing stuff right
and yeah
i even thought that
yeah maybe the theory was not that good

[1:15:02]
yeah maybe the theory was not that good
even at that time i uh yeah had those
insights in my mind
while you the truth was actually that
you very much understood it only you
were
listening to your brain and to your gut

[1:15:15]
listening to your brain and to your gut
right
[Music]
um
we
around this time you're playing i think
mid sticks you mentioned that it was
around 2016 i believe when you reach 2k

[1:15:30]
around 2016 i believe when you reach 2k
was this then
breaking free was that enough to reach
2k
for you
um
i guess

[1:15:45]
at that time i
i was still playing a more or less uh
the fixed game
but uh
it was it was a way more

[1:16:01]
it was it was a way more
uh free free strategy than than
originally so uh
um
i gave myself
uh
i gave myself opportunities to deviate

[1:16:15]
i gave myself opportunities to deviate
and
yeah
it felt like uh like a relief
one another thing that helped me a lot
with uh establishing myself at satsuki

[1:16:31]
with uh establishing myself at satsuki
was
when i analyzed
uh
the database of uh
otb red baron
if you remember that guy
like like many have done before you yeah

[1:16:46]
like like many have done before you yeah
yeah exactly and i
i've seen
how freely he played
how much he deviated from
the optimal game
and

[1:17:00]
and
that gave me you know this it's
permission myself to not to play a fixed
game not to play the strategy uh that is
uh
very fixed and not allow allowing for

[1:17:18]
very fixed and not allow allowing for
any creativity
so uh
yeah i guess uh otb
will always be in my heart
i have to be up much love right there
for 404 odb no it was funny that you you

[1:17:33]
for 404 odb no it was funny that you you
mentioned this also with stefan because
back then remember you had you had odp
and you had linus and linus was way more
fixed in terms of
the the parameters that he allowed is
strategy

[1:17:45]
strategy
to be constructed around whereas with
odb you always had that effect you had
no clue what to expect he could now
throw out the 10 20 30 40 50
100 200 300 you would just do random
things on the fly
and that made it that element of
surprise made it way harder uh harder to

[1:18:02]
surprise made it way harder uh harder to
play against him than to linus in the
beginning even though obviously they
were both crushing the games
i feel uh
uh
well i do not remember exactly how otb

[1:18:17]
well i do not remember exactly how otb
played in terms of that uh
um
freedom
uh i do not really recall about him
using um as many sizings as you
mentioned maybe he did i do not remember
now
what's really

[1:18:31]
what's really
um
what i can really think about
was that he
he he modified the rangers very well he

[1:18:46]
he he modified the rangers very well he
adjusted the ranges very well so uh
he was definitely the guy who had
the answers why he puts a hand to a
certain range
and

[1:19:03]
i feel that's the difference between him
and early liners
linus tried maybe tried to uh to
play as solar did at that time

[1:19:16]
play as solar did at that time
however otb tried to
make more sense
with with every single uh
play that he made
yeah he was definitely thinking he had
more of the achieving mindset okay what

[1:19:30]
more of the achieving mindset okay what
does this hand want to achieve how can i
accomplish what i'm trying to accomplish
and do that basically right then this is
also kind of the same way that i
approach poker you have a hand you want
to achieve something
it wants to accomplish something and
therefore a bad sizing rolls out or a

[1:19:45]
therefore a bad sizing rolls out or a
check rolls out because you want to
achieve something and basically all
hands in your range want to achieve a
different thing by sometimes by checking
sometimes betting big something betting
small and in the end a balanced strategy
will sort of roll out because certain
hands for example want to slow play

[1:20:00]
hands for example want to slow play
certain hands want to fast play and i
think otb did that very well and by
thinking in terms of this way you can
kind of construct your ranges
around
i i usually call this being lucky more
often or at least perceived to be lucky
more often right because you're trying

[1:20:16]
more often right because you're trying
to build strategies around trying to
not get yourself in reverse imply that
situation as often but more in implied
situations but people don't know
basically you're you're getting luckier
by design that was i think something
that he was doing very well and he was i

[1:20:31]
that he was doing very well and he was i
think one of the one of the first ones
implementing that very well
yeah i'm glad you mentioned that uh that
concept of uh being lucky more often
than your opponents uh you're not the
first person who

[1:20:46]
first person who
um
told me about that idea
uh
so i guess uh yeah he was doing that
um
so
and as time went on
more and more people started to

[1:21:00]
more and more people started to
implement that concept in their games
and more people started getting more
lucky
yeah and then suddenly everyone was
lucky right but someone else is still
remain unlucky but then i guess you know
some card distribution if you if you

[1:21:15]
some card distribution if you if you
become strong player against strong
player this was probably also the time
that
solvers
came out right you reached 2 2k in 2016
if exhaust come out 2015 16
yeah yeah probably at that's at that
time or allegedly allegedly they say the

[1:21:32]
time or allegedly allegedly they say the
word of the street is that some people
had a software before that like for
example in otb or linus uh private
solvers i heard about i remember canoe
showing in his course that he had a
private solver already back in the day
so i'm sure there were some people

[1:21:45]
so i'm sure there were some people
uh already
deep into silverland you
had already some experience
with studying theory and deeply with
metro agenda you were already aware of
like the threats it would have
i'm i'm making an assumption now here

[1:22:01]
i'm i'm making an assumption now here
that at some point you started to work
with a solver like i think 99 of players
when starting to work out with a solver
as the experience you had with metro
gender did that help you
prevent certain mistakes with a solver
also maybe your background you studied

[1:22:15]
also maybe your background you studied
the master
masters you have a master's in
mathematics did these things help you
using the solver
or implementing knowledge from a solver
in a better way
well i guess i had

[1:22:30]
well i guess i had
advantage and advantage initially
because
i was familiar with a lot of things
conceptually that the solver was
implementing
and for
a lot of other players who started

[1:22:47]
a lot of other players who started
working with the solar without prior
theory knowledge
they definitely were making
quite a few mistakes
in fact one of the

[1:23:00]
in fact one of the
guys that i worked with
um before
before we started
our cooperation uh he had been doing
uh

[1:23:16]
he had been doing a single mistake uh
every single time
when using solar
it was about
well
you know in solvers you have to

[1:23:33]
you know in solvers you have to
um create a tree for a certain situation
and then
run solar and allow
um
the solution to be
calculated
so uh
and

[1:23:45]
and
i
remember he
added let's say a sizing
on the flop a different sizing
and then immediately started
recalculating the solution so he added
just one node

[1:24:02]
just one node
and he did not even check
all the turn and river actions that were
created in this node
and that
that mistake skewed the result quite a
bit

[1:24:15]
bit
yeah so what you're referring to let's
say for example
you only give the solver a small bet on
turn a river
then he would always prefer a big bat or
usually prefer a big bet on the flop or
use a certain check strategy in order to

[1:24:30]
use a certain check strategy in order to
raise because he cannot get money in in
the traditional way a little street
because you catch him to bigger sizing
so therefore the output is good actually
it's funny you can actually learn quite
a lot from a solver by sort of
handcuffing him in certain ways like oh
you're not allowed to do this then

[1:24:45]
you're not allowed to do this then
what's your solution and he sometimes
comes up with very creative solutions
that i found out like some concepts by
accident just by screwing up my sim
basically
yeah i guess you have to be very careful
with interpreting the solver solvers

[1:25:02]
with interpreting the solver solvers
results so first of all you have to be
confident in in the tree that you are
that the solver is calculating
um and uh

[1:25:17]
um and uh
yeah basically
what i'm trying to say is that uh do
not do not trust everything you see that
uh the solver uh suggests you're doing

[1:25:31]
uh the solver uh suggests you're doing
so
i think with your with your own uh head
and yeah try to make sense
of uh
whether the the result is correct or not
that's uh that's a very good advice
usually i also ask ask the gaston to

[1:25:46]
usually i also ask ask the gaston to
have a good tip but i think this is this
is an excellent tip
uh adam
solvers heads-up city goes world
probably was in the same yeah probably
came out around the same time right 2015
does 16. were you still playing back
then and do you remember some blunders

[1:26:01]
then and do you remember some blunders
you made starting to use solvers
yeah i think southwest like 2015 2016
before
they started getting used i was playing
one kids of city ghosts at the time and
yeah strategy started to deviate a lot
and basically everyone started to

[1:26:15]
and basically everyone started to
realize we suck at this game it was one
of those like kind of reality moments
where everyone thought they'd already
solved it we played 25 big blinds poker
heads up everyone thought yeah we've got
this down to a t and then basically one
service came out everyone's like whoa
actually there's a lot that we're
messing up from pre-club frequencies to

[1:26:30]
messing up from pre-club frequencies to
bed size and so yeah i think that like
it's talked about when you get into
solvers it's very hard at first not to
uh give the solver too much credits
almost be like oh well the solver is
doing this therefore i'm going to start
doing this now i can see lots of people
were misapplied in solvers by either

[1:26:46]
were misapplied in solvers by either
sitting there on game trees or they were
just like using out of context or yes i
think it's very hard like when you start
using solvers to realize okay this is
one data point this is how we play in
this scenario but the game three i'm
playing against these opponent types is
different how can i use this solve

[1:27:01]
different how can i use this solve
information to implement to deviate my
strategy but where do i how do i keep my
current strategies just like that
deviation between what you know
intuitively and what the solve is
telling you it's like an emerging point
so uh i like what sergi's been saying
throughout this conversation he comes

[1:27:15]
throughout this conversation he comes
from a theoretical background and you've
almost over your career have to give
yourself permission to explore different
avenues so i'm guessing when solvers
came out for yourself it must have been
quite a challenging point because now
you've got again a kind of fixed model
no freedom do what the solver says and

[1:27:30]
no freedom do what the solver says and
again you've got to kind of interpret
that and use it for your own benefits
same as sergi i had other friends i
lived with so i had two other guys
playing the same games as me so we would
chat over how the solver was doing stuff
and how what was useful and what was
actually happening in real games that
way play in and where's the solver

[1:27:45]
way play in and where's the solver
getting supplies i remember when the
first the servers came out there was a
year of how do people misuse solvers we
had almost like a quiz over lunch every
day how about people misusing solvers
because it was one of those real those
things where it was everyone's jumping
onto it without the right implications

[1:28:00]
onto it without the right implications
and yeah there's a lot of mistakes
getting made in that kind of time frame
so yeah i think it's it's really good to
understand like what what a what's the
solver trying to achieve what can you
learn from it but also where can you
deviate from that strategy i think so
she's been a good example for his career
of trying to find ways to uh deviate and
create freedom even though you've got a

[1:28:16]
create freedom even though you've got a
theory background
so i wanted to talk about uh what stakes
have been the biggest challenge for you
so you've moved up pretty much every
stake in the game and what was the stake
that you found the most challenging to
break into and how did you manage to
break into that level

[1:28:33]
um i guess 2k was the toughest
stake to establish myself there
i've tried
maybe five times

[1:28:45]
maybe five times
um
to
uh
to start uh playing against 2k regulars
and so while the
first four times were
um
well

[1:29:00]
well
did not uh did not work yeah uh on the
fifth time yeah
i managed to play
a session where i won around 10 points
and since then i i started playing 2k
now regularly and yeah basically never

[1:29:16]
now regularly and yeah basically never
looked back
what was different about that fifth time
where you actually cracked it
i guess uh i stopped paying off every
single time
just because of the opponents being so

[1:29:31]
just because of the opponents being so
aggro
um and yeah i feel that i i saved
quite a few stacks
uh during that session
and yeah a little bit of positive
variance helped me as well

[1:29:47]
variance helped me as well
that reminds me of we had a guest tobias
dudwan and he was having a similar
problem breaking into the high stakes as
well and his kind of advice was play
solid and it's it's when you're playing
higher stakes you often give your
opponents a lot of credits for being
very creative and you call them off

[1:30:01]
very creative and you call them off
because you're like you must have bluffs
here and then over time wait a second he
hasn't got bluffs everywhere i can balls
here i don't need to pay them and yeah
somebody's uh having the confidence to
play a solid strategy against very
confident opponents takes a bit of time
so for you it's about the fifth time
you're like wait a second i'm i'm not

[1:30:15]
you're like wait a second i'm i'm not
calling these guys off i'm going to find
faults and yeah it takes time to um
stick to your strategy in the face of
aggression against tough opponents so
for yourself you mentioned that you're
you identify yourself with being a
morbid gambler at heart rather than a
person who likes to play things safe has

[1:30:31]
person who likes to play things safe has
that character traits how does that
character trade influence your career
both in a positive and a negative way
um i guess
it helped me

[1:30:45]
not
to to stick to the boundaries to any
boundaries
so it allowed me to
to want more and more
from my poker career

[1:31:00]
from my poker career
and um
the reason i quit cap games was that at
some point i became bored
and uh
so i do not see myself

[1:31:15]
so i do not see myself
playing a boring game like uh every
single day let's say for for a year or
so or even for a couple of months
i just won't
feel happy by doing that

[1:31:31]
feel happy by doing that
so uh yeah being a gambler in heart
allowed me to
to want more and more
and
i guess if i was more
uh if i was a common person calmer

[1:31:47]
uh if i was a common person calmer
person then i would have stopped maybe
at 500 now maybe at 100 to know who
knows
and maybe we would not have been talking
today
what have been some of the negative

[1:32:01]
what have been some of the negative
sides of being a gambler at heart it's
like i said it allows you to take on
more risk you don't like being bored and
stagnating so you want to take on that
next challenge and yeah like you said a
lot of players do get stuck because they
stop they stop seeking to progress
they're happy to make a good win rates
and a good profit at a certain level and

[1:32:16]
and a good profit at a certain level and
they stop striving to and more for you
you don't have that problem but has
there been any downsides of being
someone who is a bit of a gambler likes
to take on risk does it cause you any
problems throughout your career
yeah of course and there have been quite

[1:32:31]
yeah of course and there have been quite
a few
periods where
i didn't really
enjoy the game i didn't feel well
because of that
and
you know while
taking more risk

[1:32:46]
taking more risk
could be
positive in terms of
developing yourself as a player it could
also be very detrimental to your
bankroll
and
i mentioned earlier today that

[1:33:01]
i mentioned earlier today that
sometimes it was tough for me to quit
playing because i was so immersed into
the game
and
yeah some of the sessions i played did
not end very well

[1:33:15]
not end very well
i remember myself losing
10 or even 20 lines in a single session
and yeah that's the opposite side of uh
being a gambler i guess
um yeah it was any experiences you
mentioned that losing 10 20 buy-ins was

[1:33:31]
mentioned that losing 10 20 buy-ins was
there any what experiences which like
really uh head ear profound effect on
you we had to almost go wait a second
this is this is scary i could go broke
here and put myself a lot of risk was
that any because you're someone who you
see you say it would play a lot of
volume and you might finish a session 10

[1:33:46]
volume and you might finish a session 10
hours a bit of a blurry last few hours
of that did you have any moments which
were quite scary but you're like wait a
second i put myself at too much risk
right now with the with the strategy i'm
using
it did not feel that way when i was

[1:34:01]
it did not feel that way when i was
playing however afterwards when i have a
cool brain
then
i can
[Music]
i was able to
analyze what happened

[1:34:15]
so
yeah it was scary definitely um
i remember once i lost
roughly a quarter of my bankroll in in
one week
and yeah i was
very depressed at that moment

[1:34:33]
it impacted a lot of areas of my
ordinary life outside of poker
for example i had
i started having problems with my sleep

[1:34:47]
i started having problems with my sleep
and that affected my
results even more
because as we both would agree
proper sleep is
is a key to being successful in poker

[1:35:00]
is a key to being successful in poker
and then like i guess in everything in
our lives
so uh
do not do not play with your sleep
yeah i'm a big fan of sleep i've been
tracking mine for four years now with
this whoop tracker which gives me a

[1:35:15]
this whoop tracker which gives me a
daily recovery score same as you can
agree in your sessions on a daily basis
this gives me a quantifiable sleep
metric that i can use over time to uh
alter my behavior i know if i've done
certain things that contributes to a low
score for my sleep scores and over time

[1:35:30]
score for my sleep scores and over time
i can basically create an optimal
routine that allows me to get good
recovery good sleep and good performance
yeah i think it's important for you to
acknowledge like you
generally are someone who likes to take
on more risk and i always feel like it's
good to know yourself well enough so
that you can balance out your kind of

[1:35:45]
that you can balance out your kind of
positive traits that can become negative
so if we look at being a gambler at
heart it's amazing if you want to play
high stakes and especially the
nosebleeds you play but at the same time
it's gonna put you in situations where
you might take on too much risk which
might impact your bankroll it may impact
your personal life it might put a lot of

[1:36:00]
your personal life it might put a lot of
stress on you so you can't sleep so
you've got to always be careful to kind
of tread that line where okay i'm a
gambler hot but i don't want to be a
reckless gambler because like a lot of
players get in trouble that way you know
that people will be the opposites
they'll be very safety oriented and they
need to gamble more so it's almost like
understanding where you are and trying

[1:36:15]
understanding where you are and trying
to find that kind of balance points for
your personality type and unfortunately
we often have to learn the hard way we
have to have to go too far one way
before we get back into an alignment and
that's the growth of a human being in
all honesty yeah it sounds like for you
you've been conscious of that you've
been mindful of it and yeah it's allowed

[1:36:31]
been mindful of it and yeah it's allowed
you to uh at least find that balance for
you obviously you're someone who takes
on
a lot more risk than the average person
uh just based on the level you play at
the same time you're not reckless with
that and you found that kind of balance
for you so you don't take on unnecessary
risk which is good

[1:36:45]
risk which is good
all right so i want to talk about the
russian community so they're a bit of a
hotbed for talent obviously it's a big
country as well how about you guys as a
community so we spoke a little bit
offline before we started how is the uh
russian community around each other
let's see the high stakes community is

[1:37:00]
let's see the high stakes community is
there a big group of you guys who study
together who share strategy um yeah how
do the high stakes russian communities
interact
well i can only speak for myself
i guess
there were
two instances throughout my career where

[1:37:16]
two instances throughout my career where
i worked with
two poker partners
and nowadays i work only with one
so
i feel that for me
at this stage of my career where i am

[1:37:31]
at this stage of my career where i am
it's it's totally enough
from what i've heard there are
well groups of
i don't know maybe three to four people
who study together but these are just
rumors i do not have any confirmation of

[1:37:47]
rumors i do not have any confirmation of
that
i know that
there are a few poker players the
the top the top guys

[1:38:00]
the top the top guys
from russia who
have studied on their own throughout
their career
and uh
yeah some of them started playing when
uh at this time
um at the same time with me

[1:38:16]
um at the same time with me
unfortunately i'm i feel that i'm not
allowed to disclose their nicknames
but yeah
so i would say that
there are different ways of how
players from pro russian poker community

[1:38:31]
players from pro russian poker community
approach study yeah some of them
do that alone and yeah some study in
groups
yeah so it sounds like it's most common
to study in a small group maybe three
four of you guys who will study together
throughout your career we spoke with

[1:38:46]
throughout your career we spoke with
halsey on our previous podcast he's from
the spanish community sounds very
similar they have like small subgroups
of maybe three or four of them who study
together and then they interact can they
loose sleep between their communities
but yeah they have like kind of small
small circles where you you know
everything about each other and you you

[1:39:00]
everything about each other and you you
help each other with career and then
there's other groups doing doing some
other thing but yeah it's always
interesting from the outside because i
think the russian community in
particular is quite private compared to
uh like other communities and i guess
you guys obviously study together in
your communities you've got your own
language which is a barrier for any
english people trying to study with high

[1:39:16]
english people trying to study with high
stakes russian players yeah it's
interesting to know what different
approaches like i said there's obviously
some players who just do it alone do by
themselves and they'll have equal
success so yeah there's more than one
path to reach the top end yeah it's
always good to you and to learn about
other communities all right so i want to

[1:39:31]
other communities all right so i want to
ask a question so i'm going to reflect
basically on your career a little bit so
what's one thing your career has taught
you that you didn't expect
um

[1:39:47]
i guess the main takeaway is that
um
you do not have any limits in your life
so

[1:40:01]
i don't remember exactly which guests
shared this
same idea that
it's just a matter of
the hours that you put in that are
required to succeed

[1:40:16]
required to succeed
basically in
every
maybe every area of your life
so uh
it's not about talent it's about

[1:40:31]
it's not about talent it's about
work ethic it's about
self-discipline
and it's about
work-life balance that you have
so if you have
um

[1:40:45]
um
all the those
points ticked
then you could succeed
basically in every area that you would
like to
what a powerful lesson andy i think i
love that it's what you're saying there
is basically we don't really have any

[1:41:01]
is basically we don't really have any
limits the limits are based on how much
we can apply ourselves how much effort
we can put in how much time and hours
and very often we create our own limits
with our own narratives we think we can
get to a certain level achieve a certain
outcome in any endeavor and we often

[1:41:15]
outcome in any endeavor and we often
limit that pursuit and for you for the
poor grabber suit you've realized with a
second there aren't any really limits
obviously there's the certain physical
limits like if i wanted to break the 100
meter world record i'm probably going to
run into some genetic um
obstacles there but most endeavors
especially when it comes to the mind and

[1:41:31]
especially when it comes to the mind and
creating life circumstances there are
limits it's just what you can apply
yourself to very often being around
people i actually get a question to
follow-up question on that is there
anyone who is in your circle you've been
around who's helped you to think that
way because myself i was living with two
other poker players and i was struggling

[1:41:46]
other poker players and i was struggling
to always keep progressing with like the
next level there was a few points where
i wanted to kind of stop in my career
but the guys i was living with were
always more ambitious than me and they
were always going let's go the next step
let's do the next thing so i i would
always like see say their ambition and
go right i want to do the next thing but

[1:42:00]
go right i want to do the next thing but
for me it was a bit counterintuitive at
first but i over time i learned to adopt
that philosophy and mindset so for you
was that anyone around you any role
models and that's allowed you to think
without limits whilst you're progressing
um there is one guy

[1:42:16]
um there is one guy
who i worked with
in my career
his nickname is jacer13337
at pokerstars
he's not playing anymore
but
he

[1:42:30]
he
used to be
a very top regular at
the highest stakes on poker stars
so uh when we initially started working
with him i
i played 2k in 5k
and i thought at that point that

[1:42:47]
and i thought at that point that
that was
enough for me
so i was making
quite a bit of money there
and
so i basically was trying to improve my
strategy without uh moving up in stakes

[1:43:02]
strategy without uh moving up in stakes
and
at one of our
earliest sessions
he showed me a couple of hands from
10k and 20k
and we started analyzing them

[1:43:16]
and we started analyzing them
and i realized that there were the same
people playing
more or less uh his
reasoning behind the place that
his opponents made were
well close to the reasoning that i had

[1:43:33]
well close to the reasoning that i had
at my regular stakes
and
that was definitely a breakthrough for
me
um seeing
my friend playing those limits and
seeing that
we were roughly at the same level at

[1:43:46]
we were roughly at the same level at
that point
really made myself believe in that i
could could achieve way more i could
start playing
those
high stakes and
i started

[1:44:00]
i started
and i'm very grateful
to
jacer
whose name is sergey
as well
and yeah
like i like us otb he will
be in my heart forever

[1:44:15]
be in my heart forever
it's interesting that we often cap
ourselves at a certain level so for you
2k 5k it seemed like a point where you
almost want to stop progressing and like
optimize your win rate at that level but
it only takes like a little bit of a an
insight into the levels above because

[1:44:30]
insight into the levels above because
often at that time you start to uh
glorify the levels above you put them on
a pedestal and you're like all right
these are amazing the 10ks 20ks must
just be some gt or guards i'm not going
to go there but then you're going to get
insight into that level and go wait a
second it's not that much difference to
the level i'm playing and then you see

[1:44:45]
the level i'm playing and then you see
someone who's in your circle actually
playing those games and having success
and all of a sudden the spark goes off
you're like i can do it too and that's
somebody's all it needs that like that
willingness to go i can see that i could
make it at that level and then from
there obviously it takes a long time to
progress your game build your bankroll a

[1:45:00]
progress your game build your bankroll a
lot of kind of skills you need to learn
on the way but that spark goes off and
before you know you're trying to be a
10k player 20k player 100k and i'll play
going forward and yeah you keep progress
and see i'm really interested in i think
it's awesome when you've got someone in
your environment who could be a spark
whether it's a coach a friend or yeah of

[1:45:15]
whether it's a coach a friend or yeah of
you you're around
all right so what would you say what the
biggest contributor to your poker
success very tough question i know er
but what separates you from see a player
who gets stuck at the mid sticks for
example a lot of players progress to
certain level and then they can't keep
progressing you've went all the way to

[1:45:31]
progressing you've went all the way to
north please like uncomprehend the
middle stakes for a lot of players what
do you think's been the biggest
contributing factor towards that
um
i feel that

[1:45:45]
i feel that
there is a lot more um
that determines poker success
apart from the poker strategy that you
have
so uh
i feel that work-life balance is very
important
uh your health your nutrition

[1:46:01]
uh your health your nutrition
your workout routine
um your relationship with your family
and friends
if you
if some of those areas are not

[1:46:17]
if some of those areas are not
are not well in your life that will
definitely have an impact on your
overall poker performance
so
i feel that

[1:46:30]
i feel that
the best players in the world
are the ones who
who have
high levels in every aspect of their
lives
so uh
i feel that

[1:46:47]
i feel that
that's
that should be
what those mistakes players
should be striving for
not only to create uh an ideal
uh non-beatable strike poker strategy

[1:47:01]
uh non-beatable strike poker strategy
but also other adjacent parts of their
lives
so have you said that preaching to the
choir here yeah i think it's
it's such an overlooked avenue where
players who are trying to succeed let's
see a mistakes player who's stuck very

[1:47:15]
see a mistakes player who's stuck very
often he's trying to double down on
strategy he's trying to find the next
kind of quirky part of his game that he
can improve on and he's neglecting all
the work-life balance stuff his health's
a mess his relationships are a mess um
his nutrition's all over the place he's
got a lot of stress in these
environments and he just pushes that one

[1:47:31]
environments and he just pushes that one
side because he wants to make money in
polka and he thinks once he's achieved
success he'll fix all those problems but
what you're seeing is basically you need
to have these things in alignment all
the way through and they actually feed
into each other and i've had so many
conversations with players who are like
yeah but i don't know i haven't got time

[1:47:45]
yeah but i don't know i haven't got time
to work out i have the time to uh have
good relationships i'm just grinding all
the time i'm busy playing poker give me
a break and i always like try to
say the same things you're saying like
if you want to succeed in poke out the
long term these things are fundamental
for you as a human to show up and
perform at a high level you need your

[1:48:01]
perform at a high level you need your
life in order now that can be very
different to certain people some people
like to spend a lot of time with other
people to kind of feel fulfilled and
good others can just see their friends
once a week once every two weeks and
that's enough for them so the kind of
work-life balance isn't like a perfect
metric game it's more like understanding

[1:48:16]
metric game it's more like understanding
things that are important to you as a
person and what makes you feel good and
fulfilled and taking those boxes over
time like having a kind of day routine a
week routine that allows you to feel
good and perform well like i said health
nutrition relationships are three of the
key ones that are going to implement

[1:48:30]
key ones that are going to implement
that i think if you talk about short
samples like say three months six months
it doesn't matter as much because you
can almost get away with anything you
just blast away and grind and study but
when we're talking like 12 years like
your career obviously things matter a
lot it's almost like fueling yourself
it's almost like a formula one car

[1:48:46]
it's almost like a formula one car
taking pit stops in refueling we need
those as a human to keep going so for
you uh i really like that when the life
lesson is to uh be more holistic and
treat your performance overall in terms
of the variables your lifestyle are
super important and work-life balance is

[1:49:00]
super important and work-life balance is
yeah kind of fundamental it's funny i
always feel like players don't like that
terminology work-life balance every time
i've done a video on that it always
fluffs like hell and i need to find a
different way of talking about the
lifestyle balance that players need to
succeed because players either for all
florida all against this they're like

[1:49:15]
florida all against this they're like
yeah yeah i want to live a balanced life
or like no i want to work like crazy
ever yeah i really think it's an
important avenue and a lot of players
will
be doing pretty badly in a lot of these
areas and it's so much edge uh to be
gained if you can get it back in
alignment so yeah glad you said that
ready how about yourself what are some

[1:49:31]
ready how about yourself what are some
of the what was what's the biggest
lesson you've learned throughout your
pocket career
it's the biggest lessons i learned
throughout my book career man you're
putting me on the spot here i thought i
was a podcaster not not not the person
being interviewed the biggest life

[1:49:45]
being interviewed the biggest life
lesson i learned throughout my poker
career
man there are so many but for me one big
big breakthrough moment
was actually sort of similar what sergey
described uh i'm uh teamed up with

[1:50:01]
described uh i'm uh teamed up with
explode777 uh
and
i remember when we joined he came up
with the idea of that we were going to
become the best and i just always played
poker in order to live
so
what that did with my brain was like

[1:50:17]
what that did with my brain was like
okay so if we try to become the best
what
are we supposed to be doing on a daily
basis in order to become the best
right
so i started to indeed then also think
about nutrition i started to hire

[1:50:31]
about nutrition i started to hire
coaches in terms of improving my
performance i started to work with the
solver because before that i wasn't
working with solvers we started to study
other players everything in order to
progress so i would say
that
having a big goal or
a big picture to go towards

[1:50:47]
a big picture to go towards
will help you then
be
come a bit more resourceful and trying
to think okay how can i get there and
then you get into this path of
development in order to get to that goal

[1:51:00]
development in order to get to that goal
and i think it was
in the podcast with gvlstar that he also
talked about that
why it took him 12 years not six years
and a big part of it was this there was
no necessity to perform there was no
necessity to become better because he
didn't have a big goal
so i would say for me that

[1:51:16]
so i would say for me that
was one of the biggest lessons i don't
think without
being in that environment
that i was with him saying that we are
going to become the best
uh yeah i would not have reached the
levels that i've reached for sure

[1:51:33]
levels that i've reached for sure
i feel it's uh very important to be
uh cautious with
with
like setting this
very high goals for yourself

[1:51:46]
very high goals for yourself
um so uh i've said well not not the
similar ones but
i've i've had goals of becoming the
player who
who has won

[1:52:00]
who has won
the most throughout the calendar year
but that's uh
you know a pretty significant goal
and uh
so i set up in set up that goal in
january i don't remember the year

[1:52:16]
january i don't remember the year
and
roughly in
like
i don't know in a three months time i
realized that it would be very tough and
realizing that
the

[1:52:30]
the
it will be tough for you to accomplish
your goal is mentally very draining
so
i feel
uh the strategy that has been working
for me throughout those years is to set
uh two goals

[1:52:45]
uh two goals
the first goal is the one that
it is very likely that you will uh
achieve and the second one is
that first one plus let's say i don't
know 10 to 15 percent
uh if when we can

[1:53:02]
uh if when we can
you can say like that
i think a big problem with big goals if
you limit it to a time constraint i
think that's usually where it goes wrong
for example when we
two things the time constraint and also

[1:53:15]
two things the time constraint and also
how black and white you take it for
example i never i never was the best
poker player in the world and that was
actually also not really the point it's
more in trying to become the best you're
more likely to reach number 10
then
if you wouldn't try to become the best

[1:53:31]
if you wouldn't try to become the best
you would probably strengthen number 50
right
so let's say for example you set out to
make a million okay
you're maybe not likely to make that
million but
if you your goal is to make 100k you

[1:53:45]
if you your goal is to make 100k you
will reach 100k but not 500k whereas if
your goal is to make a million you might
reach 500k which is still higher than
the 100k
even though you didn't reach your goal
you still made more money did you kind
of get what i'm saying
yeah yeah i see your points yeah behind

[1:54:00]
yeah yeah i see your points yeah behind
it it's more it's more that you then
think resourceful
and the problem with the time constraint
is that as you said after three months
when it's not working you're like that's
not gonna work i only have nine months
left so you quit whereas if there's no
time constraint and it's not working
you're gonna try to think about okay

[1:54:15]
you're gonna try to think about okay
it's not working the way i'm currently
doing it how can i improve what are my
current leaks and this can be work life
balance related or strategically related
or whatever in order to become at least
closer to that goal you need to have you
need to have something pulling you

[1:54:31]
need to have something pulling you
forward like a drive that you want to
try to get somewhere you need to have a
reason to get out of bed in the morning
and be like ah this is what i'm working
towards
uh i didn't say that i gave up
i said that it was

[1:54:46]
i said that it was
mentally more tough
to okay to realize that it will be
less likely that you accomplished the
goal that you had set up three months
before
yeah and then it can also be deep
motivating and i think especially if you

[1:55:01]
motivating and i think especially if you
put time constraint on for example
playing a certain stake then you know
certain things are out of your control
you might take a shot the shots don't
work out that's extra frustrating and
you build up extra stress because oh
[ __ ] now i only have six months left to
reach by go off that stake oh i don't

[1:55:16]
reach by go off that stake oh i don't
have time to grind out now on this lower
stakes oh why is this downswing here i
only have six months left i can see a
narrative like that becoming very
stressful in the mind where if you're
just like listen still the goal i'm
going to reach it i don't know when but

[1:55:30]
going to reach it i don't know when but
when i'm ready i'll i'll try it again
it's way more
peaceful
do you hear the difference in terms of
when i explain it um
i had a i had a question
you said that you were trying to take

[1:55:45]
you said that you were trying to take
shots
at 2k i think you tried six times and
the sixth time you you you succeeded
what do you think
set at the 2k guys apart from the guys
that you were used to playing with at
like 500 now 600 1k now

[1:56:05]
well first of all they had
the names that were recognized
in all of the high stakes community i'm
talking about the guys like otb

[1:56:17]
talking about the guys like otb
um f my life
poker stars
that was a huge winner at that time
um he's actually if my life is actually
one of the guys that had the biggest
impact in my poker career usually it was

[1:56:30]
impact in my poker career usually it was
a little bit like my
what what was
uh jacer for you he was a bit like me
yeah when i started to play poker i
think 11 years let's say 11 12 years ago
i moved to malta and i was in a house
with my life scarface vot you probably

[1:56:46]
with my life scarface vot you probably
remember as well yeah yeah and then
especially back then
no no he's he lives the retired life in
portugal
uh but he
so he was already playing 5k
back then and me and scarface were

[1:57:02]
back then and me and scarface were
playing 200. so you can imagine the gap
right and i remember back then he was
only 17
pokestar's aware of this by now uh he
was playing on his mother's account
and in the end you know he settled it
but it was like a 17 year old kid

[1:57:16]
but it was like a 17 year old kid
playing 5k
and yeah he was uh he was very smart and
he taught us a lot of things about poker
uh that helped us uh progress throughout
your career so interesting that that you
that you that that you named him

[1:57:30]
that you that that you named him
but he was definitely i remember he was
definitely one of the one of the end
bosses on poker stars back then 2k 5k
i remember that i
caught a little bit of time playing
against uh
for haley
and uh

[1:57:46]
and uh
that's a russian legend right yeah for
haley um
i have not played
any hands with true teller at that time
what about claw viper
um yeah i recognize that name

[1:58:01]
um yeah i recognize that name
there have been rumors that he was
cheating
really
even at that time
um yeah i do recall he at some point
because he would move down and up
through stakes like crazy and then he

[1:58:15]
through stakes like crazy and then he
would play 10k heads up against for
haley and then a month later you would
see him grind 200k hands on hundreds and
now
yeah heads up probably did not
did not go well
um
yeah
so otb

[1:58:31]
so otb
linus
um
i guess there probably were some other
guys
uh very good ones
i don't recall their names so
i guess

[1:58:45]
i guess
when you
move up in stakes and start playing
against
very recognized players
you have that additional burden
on you

[1:59:00]
on you
so uh
maybe their their strategy is not
that does not have a
significant edge over you but the fact
that
you know that
they are recognized and

[1:59:16]
they are recognized and
they're recognized to be one of the best
player players in the world
they
that fact gives
them
additional advantage over you
and that's probably what happened

[1:59:31]
and that's probably what happened
with me
during those five
shots
at 2kml
so i guess i over estimated
how good those sub players were
and i gave them too much credit let's

[1:59:47]
and i gave them too much credit let's
say
for example
uh to be able to bluff in every single
spot that i called them down
so
yeah and once i
get calmer

[2:00:01]
get calmer
i
yeah i started playing better
and yeah i managed to to establish
myself in those stakes
nowadays you play all the way up to 100k
now i'm gonna sort of then repeat the
question what's the difference between a

[2:00:15]
question what's the difference between a
2k and l rack and 100k now wreck is
there a difference or is it all in our
head
well there is uh
quite a difference
there is a quote

[2:00:31]
there is a quote
by true teller
who said that
everyone is scared money
it's just a matter of finding that point
of when someone becomes

[2:00:47]
vulnerable to the stakes they're playing
so uh
i feel that
a lot of guys who
who place those stakes

[2:01:03]
are not rolled to play there
and that
i feel limits to some extent
how they can play
um

[2:01:18]
for example playing tokyo now a lot of
people have
let's say 50 to 100 lines at those
stakes meaning that if they make five
large bluffs

[2:01:30]
large bluffs
with all of them which are unsuccessful
that does not impact their bankroll all
that much however if you make
a five marginal place at 100 know
that means that maybe half of your
bankroll is gone

[2:01:47]
bankroll is gone
and that that fact
influences
how people play
i feel that
games can get
a little bit meatier

[2:02:02]
a little bit meatier
with those players
with scared money
at the table
however
the opposite is also true
uh if some

[2:02:15]
uh if some
let's say chinese businessman
us
sit at the table and start playing
they probably have infinite bankrolls
that means that scared money is not a
concept that can be applied to them

[2:02:30]
concept that can be applied to them
so the game becomes a madness in that
case
and
being able to play in that madness is
also a skill because that that's
probably not what a lot of players are
used to let's say that your regular

[2:02:47]
used to let's say that your regular
stake is 5k
and
you are used to
let's say
plus 50k minus 50k swings a day and

[2:03:00]
plus 50k minus 50k swings a day and
that's okay for you you're fine with
however a madness at 100k
means plus a million minus a million
swings per day
and that's a
completely different story
and you really have to have still nerves

[2:03:18]
and you really have to have still nerves
as well as a large enough bankroll to
know in order to
deal with that under pressure
interesting so there's like an before
you make the bluff

[2:03:31]
you make the bluff
before you shove your stack in you you
get into a spot like yeah i'm gonna have
to shove my stack in here not very happy
about it why do i get this scenario it's
100k i would prefer to make this bluff
for 5k that's kind of
so if you have like your decision making

[2:03:46]
so if you have like your decision making
in your brain let's say it's a battery
you have 100
a little part of it can be taken as you
mentioned before by the fear factor of
other players so basically before the
head start you already wasted 10 of your
brain power to like oh [ __ ] i'm playing
against linus and then there's like an

[2:04:00]
against linus and then there's like an
extra 10 being taken away of like oh i
don't want to bluff my stack away for
100k so basically you have less brain
power left to make a good decision
that's kind of
how
i wow i'm interpreting this um i'm not
saying that it's uh my thought process

[2:04:17]
saying that it's uh my thought process
necessarily
i feel that
well the way you described it
could be very true for some people that
are playing there
who are not rolled

[2:04:30]
who are not rolled
and
by not truth i mean that they do not
have 50 binds at those things
so
i cannot only
speculate about
the

[2:04:46]
the depth of each player's
bankroll but
i feel that
yeah some guys definitely do not have
enough money to comfortably play there
one thing i also noticed

[2:05:00]
one thing i also noticed
in
for example take high stakes i i say
sketch games compared to midsection
games is the time they take for their
decisions
i feel like on every street
there is being way more time time used
than on mid stakes for example

[2:05:16]
than on mid stakes for example
which i think is good advice for midsex
players to take time for your decisions
i think this is something that i always
see different high sex games always take
way more time for their decisions to
figure out
a play that they want to make

[2:05:31]
a play that they want to make
have you noticed this as well
well i'm probably the the person who
uses the most uh time to make uh my own
decisions and some people get
pretty annoyed by that

[2:05:46]
pretty annoyed by that
for example uh every every single time i
play against uh yasam gayle
uh
takes drags
he tries to tell me that i'm very slow
with making my decisions

[2:06:00]
with making my decisions
um
i guess
well i can explain my adult process
behind that
so a lot of um
a lot of decisions are
especially on the river are not

[2:06:17]
especially on the river are not
not snap decisions
let's say you have to make a marginal
bluff or you have to make marginal hero
call
so they are marginal
mark
originally

[2:06:30]
originally
so you have to think a lot
about a lot of
um
a lot of factors
in order to to make a better decision
and
let's say
you now have no not a bluff but a very

[2:06:46]
you now have no not a bluff but a very
hand
and you
somehow
want to be balanced in that pot
so that your opponents are not able to
read you
and because of that you have to use

[2:07:00]
and because of that you have to use
a significant amount of time not only
with your bluff but also with your value
hand
do you see my point behind being
balanced
yes no no
how much time you use
timing tells existing online poker
that's uh that's 100 for sure especially

[2:07:16]
that's uh that's 100 for sure especially
when you get to lower stakes but i think
also
yeah also especially when you get to
high stakes yeah like you said
also people are smarter you have to take
a bit more time for your decisions
people will read through things if you
don't think about it correctly also it

[2:07:31]
don't think about it correctly also it
helps that especially you know most of
the big online
big online cash games happen on either
gg acr and both sides have 100 second
time bank or something
so
that also i believe it's uh 80 seconds

[2:07:45]
that also i believe it's uh 80 seconds
on
80 seconds yeah that's that's more than
enough compared to in the past you know
when people played many poker stars
and at some point i remember also they
made it even shorter you don't have that
much time for your decisions um but yeah

[2:08:01]
much time for your decisions um but yeah
very good point
going
speaking about
um
going
further into stake what motivates you is
always to jump into the next take if you
play 100 knl

[2:08:16]
play 100 knl
what is the next stake is there a next
take after 100k l do we have to
transition into live poker
i've played live poker a couple of times
only a couple of times
probably to your surprise in my career

[2:08:30]
probably to your surprise in my career
and the game
has been quite
quite boring i didn't like that
so maybe
um
gg
at some point would

[2:08:46]
at some point would
announce higher stakes tables even
higher than 100k
maybe i'll give them a shot but for now
i feel that uh yeah
100k online is
is a pretty pretty nice game to play

[2:09:02]
is a pretty pretty nice game to play
so it didn't arrive to the point where
it got boring
yeah yeah well you know um
sometimes
it's not just one table of 100k
um

[2:09:15]
um
sometimes there are four tables running
like for example two years ago i believe
there were games against chinese
businessmen

[2:09:30]
there were roughly two weeks of action
from what i know
and that's uh quite a lot of volume you
can put in
you mentioned that you did hop a little
bit in the live environment

[2:09:45]
bit in the live environment
did you
you did actually mention you didn't like
it that much were there any
differences that
you noticed playing live compared to
online
oh it seemed like a completely different
game

[2:10:00]
game
to be honest
so the ranges were
way different
um
like everything was different ranges
frequencies
better sizes stack sizes
um

[2:10:15]
um
the pace of the game
the the environments
so i based basically was having
less fun than than
online so maybe one day
i'll give it one more try

[2:10:32]
i'll give it one more try
you may be also considered in terms of
the
you said that you would often get bored
if there's no more chance considered for
example switching formats again you went
from cap to 100 bb cash maybe adding
some high rollers

[2:10:45]
some high rollers
tournaments stuff like that
i have not really studied tournaments
so
and i feel that
they do not really
suit me all that much

[2:11:00]
suit me all that much
because you'll have to play
long stance
in those
[Music]
entities
um
i feel that my sweet spot is playing
roughly

[2:11:15]
roughly
two and a half to three hour sessions
and uh by doing that i can
give
the most of myself leave the most of
myself at poker tables and uh
yeah playing nine to

[2:11:32]
yeah playing nine to
let's say 12 hour sessions
like
tournament professionals do is just
not not a thing that i would like to do
yeah it's a different you need to be
your c game and b game need to be very

[2:11:46]
your c game and b game need to be very
good at tournaments whereas in poker you
can just focus on playing your a-game
very well and like i said restrict
certain durations of sessions and try to
show up on your a-game more frequently
it's a
also because of you know

[2:12:00]
also because of you know
cash games is a bit more static so we
can go into very small nuances and try
to get very close to for example gto
whereas in tournaments stack sizes keeps
on changing you have icm blah blah so
you have to
also in terms of the way you study you
have to take a way more

[2:12:15]
have to take a way more
holistic view of the game so maybe that
also
is maybe less suits you or less attracts
you
yeah maybe
if i started my career with

[2:12:30]
if i started my career with
playing tournaments
then
we would have had a different discussion
now
and i would i would have had a different
view
on uh
on what worked best for me

[2:12:45]
on what worked best for me
so so what are you currently most
excited for in poker you wake up you're
like ah it's another day at the tables
what fires you up
there is
one idea that
i constantly think about

[2:13:00]
i constantly think about
um
that's the number of mistakes i i make
every single session
and
so i'm looking
forward to eliminating those mistakes
and i can't wait

[2:13:17]
and i can't wait
when
i become a better version of myself
and see how
what my results will be
so uh

[2:13:30]
so uh
i feel that i have not realized my true
potential in poker
and that's what motivates me
so
i feel that there is
a lot of work that can be done in terms

[2:13:45]
a lot of work that can be done in terms
of improvements
and
i'm just very curious
of where it can bring me
so you look at your results like wow i
still make all these mistakes and you
know
you're you're quite the decent poker
player imagine

[2:14:00]
player imagine
imagine the results i could have if i
would eliminate these mistakes what are
some
common returning mistakes that you keep
on falling
into well one of the most common that
i have already touched

[2:14:16]
i have already touched
a little bit is not quitting when
when i should when i should quit
um
some of the mistakes are technical
um

[2:14:30]
um
like for example there are certain spots
that
i feel that i should not be paying off
at the same time there are other spots
that i should be
more
[Music]

[2:14:45]
[Music]
i should deviate
wider than i do nowadays
so in spots where people always bluff
you should always call
not not should always call but you you
can have an expositive strategy of uh
debating as much as you could and call

[2:15:01]
debating as much as you could and call
as much as you could
um these are like technical moments and
yeah other moments are
mental game moments
for example i'm pretty sure that's my
self-discipline could have been better

[2:15:16]
self-discipline could have been better
so uh
yeah basically
i have a plan like let's say a plan for
for the session that i'm going to play
and

[2:15:30]
and
i do not always stick to it
if i started sticking to it better
or more frequently at least
then i'm pretty sure
my results
would have been better

[2:15:46]
would have been better
what happens that you sometimes
mid-session abandon the plan or
not are not able to execute your
intentions for the session the way you
would like to what kind of throws you
out of balance

[2:16:04]
i'd rather keep it private to be honest
some some random guy they'll take me i
don't want to say any names
oh you mean like you don't want people
to throw to start throwing you off

[2:16:18]
to throw to start throwing you off
during while playing for example for
example it can be just
you losing five buy-ins within 10
minutes and that kind of sets you off
it's not something that people could
exploit you on uh

[2:16:31]
exploit you on uh
it's usually not about winning or losing
it's more about uh
being immersed into the game
too much
so i
i get so into the game that

[2:16:46]
i get so into the game that
i i sometimes forget about
the plan that i had per session
okay
this is so it's interesting actually
you're describing now as being too
immersed as actually sort of a problem
because you got to fall back into

[2:17:01]
because you got to fall back into
autopilot like habits that you're trying
to break
um
yeah you got that right so there are two
sides of

[2:17:15]
sides of
being too immersed into the game the
first one is that it helps you to some
degree
with
motivating you for further improvement
studying and battling against a better
and better position however from the

[2:17:30]
and better position however from the
other side yeah it could be
a little bit detrimental i feel that uh
you should
i'm not sure that's the right way to say

[2:17:45]
i'm not sure that's the right way to say
it
i feel that you should always be
aware of what's going on
and when you are immersed into the game
um too much
that awareness

[2:18:02]
that awareness
is not always present
that's how yeah
i i i i i can definitely relate to to
what you're saying i'm also curious
uh what are some things

[2:18:15]
uh what are some things
that
happen at the tables that still upset
you up until today even though you know
you know it shouldn't upset you but it
still throws you off do you still have
do you still have some bad habits in
that regards other than the playing too
long

[2:18:32]
in terms of things that upset me
i can't think of many well maybe
hit and running is not a good thing

[2:18:47]
and it's not
about let's say recreational players hit
and running it's about regular skit and
running for example they uh sit playing
three max against me and some other guy

[2:19:01]
three max against me and some other guy
they play let's say 50 hands win a
couple of buy-ins and they then they run
away
it's it's even not about being upset it
just feels
that something is wrong about those

[2:19:16]
that something is wrong about those
those guys
if he if they sit down and play then
play do not run
okay
this is this is what warning to the
poker world don't hit and run certainly
stop doing it

[2:19:30]
adam is there any hit and running in the
heads up sitting go world
you you win you win five match in a row
the sixth one you lose then you quit
not amongst the regulars very often
because basically in heads up sitting
goers you basically sit down to play

[2:19:45]
goers you basically sit down to play
whoever's in the lobby and you're
challenging them in that moment and
you'll generally load up more tables
against that opponent and play for a
period of time you've often got them on
skype so you'll arrange how many tables
you're going to play in germany's get
kind of etiquette for at least 30
minutes to an hour very often they go on

[2:20:00]
minutes to an hour very often they go on
for much more hours so yeah the same as
sergey said it'd be very frustrating for
a regular to sit you and then quit after
winning four or five buy-ins it
occasionally happens to me when i was
playing lots of tables i'd have like
seven or eight tables and then someone
would sit my higher value and then a

[2:20:15]
would sit my higher value and then a
regular from a lower stake take your
vines off me and then stop but yeah it's
very infuriating because it's just like
uh just doesn't feel fair it feels like
okay either we're playing i would not
plan make your mind up you've stopped me
you're here what what's going on so it
gives us like the kind of fight every
new and they're kind of fairness in you

[2:20:30]
new and they're kind of fairness in you
exclusively this isn't i am but it's
very uncommon in the heads of city goal
world because it's very frowned upon and
yet players who do that won't get very
far because the heads of sitting go well
you need to uh make friends along the
way to kind of share lobbies over time
so those approaches very very quickly

[2:20:45]
so those approaches very very quickly
alienate you and you one of many friends
and poke out that approach but yeah i
can relate to that fish obviously fish
hidden around all the time it's just
part of them they have a good time it's
not not the same so yeah and i guess
it's also not it wouldn't also be a
problem if you're up to pines and then
they lose right it's more that if they

[2:21:00]
they lose right it's more that if they
win body of you then they run it's like
what i cannot win it back anymore
that's kind of the problem
exactly yeah and it's like you haven't
got the opportunity to win those buy-ins
back and it's like it's such a
short-term mindset from them it's like
wait a second you literally came to a
run good and then go away and in your

[2:21:16]
run good and then go away and in your
head you're like you've got my money
you've literally just taken my money and
you're gone give me an opportunity to to
play back for it so yeah let's make
something trigger something like
internally that's not quite fair uh yeah
like i said i didn't run into it very
often in my career because it's kind of
frowned upon but yeah it can relate to

[2:21:31]
frowned upon but yeah it can relate to
it being frustrated for surgery for sure
i've had a very interesting you talk
about the high stakes games the the
nosebleeds in particular and the
psychology of those games and have
people all like kind of scared money
like the true telecourt everyone scared
money and that was really fascinating
for me because i would have thought like

[2:21:45]
for me because i would have thought like
the 5ks and 10ks would play quite
similar in terms of psychology but the
way you explained it like almost once
you get 100k there's not many people
sitting with 50 volumes like 5 million
so there's a lot of people maybe under
role to play those games so i love the
dynamics you spoke about where basically

[2:22:00]
dynamics you spoke about where basically
everyone's well a lot of players are
playing a bit tighter in those scenarios
scared many guys which creates a dynamic
of a tighter game and then you have the
other scenario where
if chinese businessman comes in it's
like the wild wild west so you've gone
from this very rigid game to a crazy
town so it must be really like for those

[2:22:17]
town so it must be really like for those
guys who are kind of scared money it
must be a big skill set to learn how to
survive and thrive in those environments
and it must create big edges and when
you're able to be somebody plays your a
good game solid game you're not scared
money with no scenarios come up it must
create a massive deviation where some

[2:22:31]
create a massive deviation where some
players make all their money during
those while periods and other players
lose it all and it reminds me of a
story about michael jordan by michael
jordan where he arrived at a golf course
in england and he was meeting up with
some football players and he was going
to play golf he's a very keen golfer and

[2:22:46]
to play golf he's a very keen golfer and
they said oh do you want to play for
money do you want to bet on on the halls
and michael jordan went sure and the guy
went how much would you like to bet the
hall and michael jordan said whatever
makes you feel uncomfortable and he's
basically trying to find the point was
like i know there's an amount of money

[2:23:00]
like i know there's an amount of money
where you're going to deviate a lot
you're going to be scared money on this
golf course so yeah it's the same kind
of philosophy where it's like everyone's
got a tipping point where things get
uncomfortable and you're unable to uh
play your best strategy when things are
high so yeah that was really fascinating
i just wanna do retouching next i think
it was a i think a lot of players who

[2:23:15]
it was a i think a lot of players who
haven't thought about the nosebleeds in
those ways but maybe i think everyone's
a robot at that time and they're so
immune to swings of money but in reality
it's people playing for large amounts of
money and the psychology of those games
is different to other games and that's
often the difference between a good 5k

[2:23:30]
often the difference between a good 5k
regular who can play his solid strategy
at 5k but put him in 100k pool all of a
sudden even the strategy might be good
enough to uh play there but he can't you
can't do it because of the implications
there so yeah very interesting all right
final question from me then i'd like to
run some up if you could go back to when

[2:23:46]
run some up if you could go back to when
you were struggling to move up let's see
it was maybe breaking a two case or
maybe admits the ex and you had to give
yourself some tips or advice from your
why self who's currently playing hundred
knl what would be some of the advice you
would give to yourself

[2:24:02]
that's a nice question again from you
adam um
let me think for a second
i guess i would say to myself that
mental game is

[2:24:15]
mental game is
as equally important as the technical
game
so i would not focus on improving only
the latter
so uh yeah i would work on both
simultaneously
and
by
if if i did that

[2:24:31]
if if i did that
i probably would have uh
[Music]
would have gone through those
struggle periods we were easier and way
faster
um

[2:24:45]
speaking of uh
yeah studying the technical game
again we touched a little bit
about
what i will just i will say in a moment
uh on our podcast so uh i would

[2:25:04]
uh on our podcast so uh i would
i would ask myself why i'm
doing an action that i'm doing
i would not
um

[2:25:18]
i would not
do some stuff just because
someone said me to do that or
it is written in an article
to do that i would try to find the real

[2:25:32]
to do that i would try to find the real
reason
behind a certain action or play or a bad
size
or a range
and
yeah just
i would probably be more curious about

[2:25:47]
i would probably be more curious about
the game than i originally was
so poker can be a very fun and uh yeah
exciting place to be in
and you know i feel that

[2:26:01]
and you know i feel that
um
modern studying which implies a lot of
solar work
takes away that opportunity for
excitement and
basically having fun

[2:26:16]
basically having fun
so
to sum up
i would try to be
more happy with my journey
uh more fulfilled with what i do and
more more curious about about the game

[2:26:31]
more more curious about about the game
itself
wow that was amazing great wise advice
to you and yourself now i always think
it's a good question because often you
get to a point in life where you can
look back and go ah there was a certain
period of my life where i was just
misapplying certain concepts i was

[2:26:46]
misapplying certain concepts i was
trying to figure it out but i was kind
of doing it kind of wrong and then you
got a point where you figured it all out
and it all makes sense you can go back
to that moment and go actually i just
hadn't knew then that this was the
better approach it would be a lot easier
so yeah for you we can see throughout
your career one of the struggles has

[2:27:00]
your career one of the struggles has
been to allow yourself to express
yourself with the strategy and also get
busy to not play this fixed game in this
fixed theory based game and allowing
yourself to you're going to deviate more
that's been like an ongoing challenge
for you and as you've got the point you
are now you can see the certain parts of

[2:27:15]
are now you can see the certain parts of
your career where you are almost
blocking yourself from progress
progressing by just almost like
following strategies that without
knowing the why behind them and not
allowing yourself to deviate and then
when it comes to uh other avenues you're
not aware how important mindset is
important how balanced lifestyle is in
order to get to where you are now and

[2:27:31]
order to get to where you are now and
that it's all going to work out in a
good way so you can enjoy the rides you
can have a fun time playing poker and
land in it it doesn't have to be um such
a sleep driving pursuit and there's a
lot of enjoyment to have on the way so
yeah appreciate that great answer any of
you any final questions for surgery

[2:27:45]
you any final questions for surgery
no i'm going to ask sergi if there's any
final things that he would like to share
with our audience and if not we're going
to wrap it up
is there anything you would like to
still share
well i guess um

[2:28:00]
well i guess um
i'm grateful
uh to
everyone who
i have met throughout my uh poker career
um
my my friends my uh poker fellows

[2:28:16]
my my friends my uh poker fellows
and i'm very happy that
at some point i decided to to start
playing this wonderful game
and
uh yeah
if if things

[2:28:31]
started differently
in 2009
my life
probably would have been very different
and i guess we would not have been
sitting here talking about
um aspects of poker

[2:28:47]
um aspects of poker
in this podcast
so
yeah i wish everyone good luck
both
in their poker developments
and
i wish them a happy fulfilling life

[2:29:04]
i wish them a happy fulfilling life
wise words of sergey what a guy what
loads of experience that he has shared
with our audience today adam what were
some of your main takeaways from this

[2:29:15]
some of your main takeaways from this
conversation
i really enjoyed today's conversation
such a nice guy and yeah very
all the wisdom that i shared throughout
that conversation the first thing i want
to touch on is this kind of permission
to express himself so he went through

[2:29:30]
to express himself so he went through
his early career sticking to kind of
rigid strategies and following theory
without knowing why he was following it
and throughout his career it's taken him
time to allow himself to to deviate to
get permission to do what he wants to do
i almost think of it like a child who's

[2:29:45]
i almost think of it like a child who's
going through their life your parents
tell you what to do then you go to a
point where you're a teenager or an
adult and all of a sudden wait a second
i can i can do what i want and this is a
freedom but it's also scary because he's
so used to being tall about to do what
he talked about when he saw sauce do a
different strategy and he's like ah wait
a second the sauce can devious then so

[2:30:01]
a second the sauce can devious then so
can i there's a lot of this trying to uh
um almost like free himself from the
fixed ridges theory stuff and to express
himself more so that was a really really
good one crowd throughout i really loved
his approach to solving the problem of
grinding too much as a performance coach

[2:30:15]
grinding too much as a performance coach
i love how he did it wavy journal after
session and he would grade his
performance based on how many hours he
played and how well he played and very
quickly after a month he would see uh
when i play over x amount of hours i can
see my performance drops off this gives
give a data point to allow to change

[2:30:31]
give a data point to allow to change
that behavior like he said it's still a
work in progress sometimes we don't
always use the data we have but now he
knows when he plays over x amount of
time it's not worth it it has a negative
impact on performance and he's able to
change that so anyone who is grinding
too much who feels like they're having

[2:30:45]
too much who feels like they're having
diminished returns in the last few hours
of the grinds start scoring your
sessions start grading yourself be
honest with that and you'll see over
time that there's a sample where you can
see ah i play too much there's a drop
off of performance which often allows
you to change that behavior next thing
was like kind of the work-life balance

[2:31:00]
was like kind of the work-life balance
he talked about i think i asked him what
was different about the high-stakes guys
compared to mid-sticks and he said just
they're more professional in how they
approached life he talked about having
good health good nutrition good
relationships being happy in themselves
and obviously this guy is around a lot
of high stakes players playing the

[2:31:16]
of high stakes players playing the
biggest games in the world and he says
that's one of the common things he sees
players who not only look at the
technical game but actually becoming
better people and actually holistically
approaching performance and poker you
might you mentioned sleep a few times as
well in terms of making sure he's rested
so he can play his best focus yeah i

[2:31:31]
so he can play his best focus yeah i
like how balanced he was overall and
then also when i said like what would be
the thing that would make your success
quicker or what lesson could you learn
to obviously give yourself one thing he
said
mindset he'd work on his mindset more i
should have proven a little bit deeper
on what he would have done at that time
throughout his mindset uh but yeah i

[2:31:46]
throughout his mindset uh but yeah i
think anyone who's exploring that give
me a shout out uh
go on my youtube channel i've got tons
of free content yeah mindset and
performance um very glad to hear that he
raised that highly obviously this guy's
a technical wizard mathematics degree a
master's level guy's very very smart but

[2:32:01]
master's level guy's very very smart but
also again the stands other factors that
contribute performance so yeah really
good conversation how about yourself
foreign
yeah you already pointed out a lot of
good ones especially the fact that
poker success is made up out of more

[2:32:17]
poker success is made up out of more
than just the technical section i think
you even gave that as an example that
players are stuck and they've at
midsects for example and they think that
what they need is more technical
knowledge uh and then even for example
if they are very solver self-oriented

[2:32:32]
if they are very solver self-oriented
more theory
it can be that maybe you should look
more at exploitative place within within
the strategical aspect but it can also
be that you have to look at your mindset
your performance the way you're managing
your career the way you've set up your

[2:32:46]
your career the way you've set up your
environment your game selection your
site selection there's so much elements
that go into being a good successful
poker player i think in the end you know
the strategical aspect of it is maybe
only 25
yet this is where people spend

[2:33:01]
yet this is where people spend
almost all their time and it's the only
thing that people think about when they
think about
improving themselves as a player
remember i think this was in the paths
episode that he
said that oh this month i'm working on
volume working on adding an extra table

[2:33:16]
volume working on adding an extra table
or improving or adding a little bit to
my current session duration these are
all ways that you can also improve as a
poker player that are often overlooked
so yeah i think that is uh um that is
that's some very good advice

[2:33:30]
that's some very good advice
you already mentioned as well right the
breaking free you don't have to do
anything right understand why something
is like that in theory and then a key
word that he mentioned was curiosity
be curious

[2:33:45]
be curious
if you look you will find different ways
right and sometimes it is also in the
permission take stefan for example that
uh i really like that we got into him a
little bit he used stefan as an example
he also used otp effing as an example um

[2:34:00]
he also used otp effing as an example um
by studying these the way that they play
it kind of gives him permission of okay
they're doing all these kind of things
and it inspires him and it makes him
curious for oh wow so you can also win
like that what else is out there right
and then he said that he kind of instead
of having one fixed way of playing he

[2:34:17]
of having one fixed way of playing he
kind of
understood what that way of playing was
trying to achieve and he understood that
based on various types of players we
could achieve it by taking different
lines so therefore his game became more
creative i think that the yeah those

[2:34:31]
creative i think that the yeah those
were definitely for me some of the main
takeaways also definitely in terms of
studying better players seeing what
they're doing
can be very inspirational as well
