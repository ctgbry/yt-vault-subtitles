in today's video I'm going to be
explaining you guys one of the most
important questions you have to ask
yourselves when playing poker and that
is what is my opponent's range now if we
look in the solver for what we should do
that what is driven by various variables
of which one of the most important ones
is equity the amount of equity we have
incentivizes us to take certain actions
like checking or betting and the type of
hands that we are incentivized to be
betting so if Equity drives our actions
and the range we Face determines the
equity one of the most important
questions we have to ask ourselves when
playing a poker hand is what is my
opponent's range a solver can teach us a
lot of valuable information about how
optimal play looks like however the way
a solver constructs its ranges is often
very different than the ranges that are
constructed in practice different range
different equities which means that we
get different incentives and often a
higher EV strategy occurs let's look at
the solver for an example now the
example that we're going to look at is a
big blind versus button term probing
example on this 874 it's going to go
check check and we are going to be
stabbing the turn and in order to
estimate what the high CV strategy for
out of position is going to be we have
to know the equities and in order to
know the equities we have to estimate
the ranges so let's start with the
solver check back range I gave it a half
see that sizing which is a very common
sizing that you will see in game on
these low boards and for that it can bet
around 52 percent now often in spots
let's say for example you study
population data you might see that the
percentage is close to the same however
on the next street so in this case the
term probe line the percentage is
suddenly different and this says a lot
about the strength of the range
construction if we look at the range
that in position is supposed to be
checking back it is going to be a
protected range okay it's going to check
back certain hands in order to
desensitize the other position from
doing a lot of stabbing because that
would cost us our Equity realization as
in position and in the end we want to
realize as much Equity as possible with
our strategy Aces for example Kings is
usually checking but also a lot of top
pairs I would say around 50 of the top
pairs are going into the check a tiny
tiny bit of set or two pairs is also
checked back and overall it's going to
be quite protect it
so let's look at the turn Deuce a deuce
is a card that doesn't really change any
of the equities and this is the turn
stabbing strategy in theory right the
GTO now you could just study this
example and be like okay it's on the
turn we should mainly be probing looks
like a bit more on the follower side big
back check I gave it a pots the 40 and
the 2E 2E in this case being 230 percent
um so yeah you could learn from that but
then you're not really
they are kind of missing the point okay
this is our turn strategy based on an
amount of equity that we have which in
this case is 47.8 percent and this
Equity is determined on the Range
construction that in position has done
as we've just shown it was protected so
the more or less protected in positions
checking range is going to be so if we
go to the flop
the more he will for example bet top
pair bet an over pair and the more you
will check back high cards the higher
Equity is going to be on for example a
deuce turn which changes our incentive
in this case spoiler alert usually we
get to bet more hands right because we
have an overarchy advantage the same is
also true if for example in position
would never bet the Flop and would just
carry all his hands to the turn then
suddenly our turn Equity will be way
lower and we're less incentivized to bet
okay and this is purely because of the
range construction that we are facing
now another thing we will then often see
is let's say in this case with a pot
but in this case you will see solvers
falling around 44 of the time now these
are spots where you can look at data of
population and you actually see the
population on average is going to be
overfolding this node now an overfold is
going to happen for two reasons first of
all the topic that we're discussing is a
range construction error the handset
with solver is calling or raising are
simply not in the range let's say the
sets that we talked about there are two
pair the top pair the over pairs they
could be less infidence range or they
are simply folding hands that are calls
it's usually a little bit of a mix in
both but especially the range
construction mess up leads to an
overfold being the case okay so what is
if we know that
okay now what is going to be the actual
strategy that we want to use and as a
more General concept what are kind of
things that change in your strategy and
how can we learn things from that that
we can use in other spots as well so for
that we have to go to the node lock
function and we make embed less strong
hands now I already did this for you so
imagine this is the current range where
incentivize the step
around 42 percent of the time we're
checking 57
whereas if we note lock the range from
this
to this which is betting more over pairs
betting more top pairs checking back
more High cards
now if we look at the turn equity
has increased we now have 49.2 it's a
small increase but we can now invest
more money in the bot as we can see
we're checking 57 now we're only
checking 44 and especially what happens
usually in these kind of scenarios is
that basically if people construct their
ranges poorly we can just bet our hand
for what it is we can just literally do
whatever our hand wants to do because
we're no longer restricted in terms of
equity mainly in terms of 4x7x fives and
sixes these hands can now bet for
smallest sizing forty percent or thirty
percent or even a quarter depending on
how your opponent Constructor this is
ranged and how your opponent reacts
simply to get some Thin value and
protection versus a range that is now
more High car driven whereas in the GTO
example or let's say someone with check
back range even a more extreme example
we cannot bet fives sixes for a seven
too often because we're simply investing
in a Range that will contain better 7x10
hours more 8X more over Pairs and we're
simply building a pot while we have an
equity
less of an equity Advantage than we have
now now another thing that we will often
see in this kind of scenarios is if the
checking range of our opponent is left
unprotected especially by not that hands
that we will have an increase in big
sizings okay now in this case the big
sizing is only used five percent of the
time it's also being divided between a
very big check race versus delay this is
another way that we can utilize this
huge range Advantage but overall it's
going pot most often and it's just gonna
increase its overall betting frequency
but mainly if strong hands are no longer
in Vietnam's range so not the hands are
no longer business range we're usually
no longer restricted in the big sizing
that we get to use this is another very
common consequence you see of weak range
constructions
now what did we learn from this example
always ask yourself what is vinian's
range figure out if and if so how they
are screwing up compared to Theory and
what the consequences for our strategy
is going to be and in this example we
showed usually it's an increase in
equity and therefore re-insentifies to
bet more hands both for protection and
bigger and more aggressive for Value
making mistakes in range construction is
one of the two most important reasons
why leaks occur then what often happens
is that the range construction is too
weak leading players to overfold or
another example when the range
construction is messed up an over or
under Bluff spot will occur now let's
jump into the tables for a live play and
explain session with an extra focus on
what is my opponent's range and how can
we deviate accordingly
we're going to be jumping into two
tables of tuna tunnel Zoom trying to
figure out to the best of our abilities
if we can find more information about
what villain's range actually is and the
consequences that we have to our
strategy but before we start though

Down Below in the description without
further Ado let's get into the action
thank you
then to tone you can play this board in
various ways to be honest
this one we get some discuss on
streambat
I think on the turn you should probably
keep on betting
went for three-quarter sizing we could
also go for an over bed I think when the
straight is on the flop
every face actually a very big bet I
already know what this guy is but
80 something percent
quite a hefty Hefty bed sizing
but so far so easy and probably just a
call down
when he snap checks
so timing is also
a way that we can better estimate
Finance range
and I feel like if you had a better hand
than being eight he would probably at
least think about it so I think we have
a very clear value bet here
and I was completely off could actually
be a recreational player with the sizing
scheme and the fact that he played his
Jack this way
but I think in general
this was
another recreational player I feel like
this read is
pretty accurate
versus them from Two and a Half to ten I
think we can just call most of our pairs
so we're dead and I will probably be
peeling my lowest pair here
to probably threes and maybe four some
of the time
foreign
for example sixes might be a good hand
to hold
enter enough hold
especially the way the diamond
PlayStation 5 is actually a pretty good
board for the big blind could actually
have in theory some leads
but usually players don't lead so what
is my opponent's range let's say you
would look at the solve
and the range has leads and then we see
check and then we see our strategy our
strategy will actually look
different
he actually snapchatt we saw on the turn
I think he's giving away some
information here about this range so
actually I'm gonna make a small block I
think he is going to have nothing or
Worse ace high very often
foreign
he checks everything towards us we
should definitely lower our C bearing
frequency so if you just think about it
well if you would have dunk beds it's
likely that when he checks to us
it doesn't have a dunk bed range that he
has actually has more Equity so we
should actually check more
and on the turn
again if you would just look at the
solver range the solver range is intact
so maybe we would most likely we would
just always check a screen given the
fact that his Snapchat I think is very
likely to just have a worse Ace hide
than us
I said King Jack I could check his King
Jack or his King but in Queens is is the
hand that has the least downsides here
again we Face the snap check
I would say his range is going to be
weak and quite made hand heavy
could have obviously
so a weak Jack that he checks but
be like
it's a bit more unlikely
what is villain's Reign 12 in his range
seemed quite weak there given the way
that he played his hand
and I decided to throw the beta with the
ace10
then obviously also showcase them
especially if you're playing an overbat
which I will usually do
in this spot but also for example I feel
like there was also a spot where if you
snap checks you can basically just bet
the strength of your hand
so let's say you have a hand who wants
to bet for protection just bad for
protection let's say you have a hand
tools pretty good
this bed pretty big
because I feel like with the timing on
the turn his range is no longer
like a solver range for example
or immediately we got a couple of
um
spots where
given timing it said something about
villain's range
and we could take advantage of that
turn I'm going to be playing
a polarized strategy
yeah it's a bit close but I wrote quite
high so
especially on a nine turn we are not
very incentivized to better four or
pocket fives
so my general approach here is going to
be polarized
okay I'm doing gonna be doing a lot of
checking
and
big betting with my strong hands or
not completely true a big bed with like
decent top pair Plus
here
it doesn't make it that big I'm tempted
to call
with the recreational limping I I don't
usually call here that much
but in this situation there's 3.5 it's
very close but
so far this guy doesn't really seem that
aggressive
okay
this one because sometimes three bets
it's time
called the female barrels I'm probably
out he could have a 10 he could have a
straight he could have a lot of equity
his barreling Ranger feel like it's
going to be very strong he should
probably add a lot of unnatural type of
loss to the burning range so I feel like
Snap fault or is this uh
someone who's a bit less creative
it is actually another spot where
I feel like
Ranger very unbalanced
continue on a team that we talked about
there's a what is the range I feel like
here you can just
basically just bet the size that your
hand is worth
especially the the how fast he checked
the turn I feel like it's very
ace high heavy or bucket sixes or
something like that
so yeah if you have a hand that wants to
bad team for Value bad team for Value if
you haven't like wanna die if it's
strong enough go for an over bed
foreign
if you had a five you should probably
see about it and I have way more 5x than
he has in the first place
so I'm actually gonna go for an over bet
you can probably just about 150 I think
that's fine and bad like king queen Plus
or something
I think that's a fine strategy
if you think the check back range is
I found a weaker side
then I feel like just
blocking for example eight seven like
the more the more hence the more the
more weak and less protected this check
background is going to be the more we
can just
bet the size of our hand I feel like on
a river I'm gonna give up uh
I actually didn't expect him to have
that hand to be honest this one we can
bet some of the time gonna bet at this
time
okay he made quite a loose call I didn't
expect him to make that call
to be honest
the turn
[Music]
on the turn what do we do on the turn
over bet
I feel like I'm gonna play over bat
checker on this turn between 10.
I'm probably going there
to call the ace Jack that time
following with the King then Suited
depending on sizing we can continue
thinking half pots very close I feel
like all options here are valid first
half pot
gonna go for the call intern is an easy
lead on a seven
pocket fives or deeper I'm actually
going to call
I feel like on
seven
it's our strategy here
are we gonna do quite a lot of blocking
again but if you don't feel like King 10
is a block
is a bit of a weird size
feels like I have 9 10 Jack 10 Jack nine
six five
I'm just trying to fold out your nothing
like I said
so
what
and this is something that you will see
more at lower Stakes
he was just betting the basically
betting the size of of his hands he just
figured well you have nothing I don't
have to bet bigger too then half pot to
love nothing
but that's not uh that's not really how
Poco works
and this is a spot where for example
these type of players when they bet very
big
then they suddenly
uh
then they suddenly have it so his whole
pot will be always Bluff
and his bigger bed will always be value
and this is definitely like if I would
be playing more often I would definitely
make a note there of this guy
okay not going to
um
here I'm gonna have two sizings on the
river probably a three quarters and a
gem I feel like Jack eight probably
makes it in the gym but it's very close
Apple hair fingers are good sizing
I feel like I should maybe check race
now
and then six
it's a bit closer
this end goes into three quarters or a
jam
king of flush definitely
goes in the gym ASAP flush goes in the
gem maybe it's a bit it didn't also the
um let's see
in the 10-6
I feel like we should now Jam
because basically there where we're
wrapping a six
and the six is probably going to be very
high in equity and
we're only betting a six
or
better
than the sizing that that six or better
type of range is worth is probably a gem
and in terms of Bluffs
we could maybe Bluff a turned flash draw
or we could Bluff
some straight draw
I think bluffinger under pair there on
the turn is actually also not bad let's
say pocket Deuces or something
ninth here I'm going to call the sizing
wasn't very big
and usually if we're a bit deeper and if
if you threw better pair but nines
I'm usually want a little bit lower a
little bit higher but uh hey we're here
now
it's for four
if I have a heart here I will continue
if I don't have a heart I will usually
default that's kind of the heuristic to
your scenarios so you should call and on
the turn he's probably gonna have to
check range
in my experience
players will
have a betting Ranger on the turn a bit
more often which leaves their checking
range
a little bit weaker
so I would have definitely uh played
that bad
and in terms of what's his range this is
just going to be my my general uh
General read and how can you get this
retail you can study population look at
lines and you'll see fold numbers again
being higher than normal which usually
indicates
indicates an error range construction
that's mainly on the turn I think on the
turn he has zero bets so when people do
bet that turn
very likely
that the drainage is pretty strong
to go back to the Jack 8 Suited
on the river I said we have two sizes
here and how do you know if you have two
sizings well that's you have to look at
the incentives the type of value hands
that you want to be betting so let's
have Aces there probably want to bet but
I probably don't want to jam
but I also have some River nuts lashes
and stuff that I do probably want to jam
but that's how I knew I was it was a
split and then probably your biggest
bets are going to be driven around
blocking the nuts so let's say it Ace
Jack with the ace of diamonds
maybe Queen Jack with the queen of
diamond something like that
your smaller bets are going to be
a band a queen Jack without a diamond
for them
but yeah going back to my uh Pakistan
story
and the eights
basically when the bigger someone goes
to saying race the less attractive call
becomes so the more you're gonna lean
towards pre-betting and it is it's the
same for four betting the smaller you
hit three bets the higher dvf call
becomes
and the bigger he three bets the less
interested we are in calling
kind of the whole idea behind that
pocket knives
first of all I feel like it's a
recreational meme race not full stack
okay on the turn a very tight positions
there's no incentive to bet for example
pocket eights for protection or
something we're gonna go more polar
right they're gonna be bluffing or
betting a king I would say in this spot
your Bloods are mainly going to come
from like the lower pairs let's say you
have pocket fives
I think that would be a good buff
they're usually going to be betting low
Pairs and King X that's kind of how
this spot will play
I don't expect much check raises here so
then let's say I did turn
some decent equity
in
to add a standard diamonds I feel like I
can bet that as well this type of
hierarchy Holdings become more checks
and spots where you expect more check
raises
there's a big theater in the house
I have to miss a big Steel
it's gonna make a small bat there with
the ace5
and actually probably going to barrel
with an overcut To The King and I feel
like especially a size for his
recreationals it's going to be very
valuable as I expect them to check all
for example twice with 9 10 with a club
or something so unfortunately he he goes
for the mid race
King Jack this deep
probably gonna call some of the time
trip at some of the time this time I
hold it very bad
if I don't want to be three betting too
much 200 Big Blends deep out of position
but we do have a suited handsome
I think that's going to be fine
flop is probably just a bet with King
Jack I don't really see anything else
that we're going to do with this hand
this Vlog we can play
in two ways
the queen tend to
we're gonna just throw out a one third
two bet here he's gonna go for a race
utilizing the fact that
I probably don't have Deuces and fives
but this is the same guy that jammed and
also raised very big so this actually
can just be a recreational
five six
[Music]
I'm gonna mix in a barrel with the five
six
I feel like on the turn I probably have
a fault
depends if our King is sometimes life
how much value we're gonna get
it's very close
I do feel like now we have a mandatory
Barrel here with a five six let's say
we're at five six of clubs I think
that's probably the barrel five six of
clubs five six space blocking so like
some Queen five suited Queen six Suited
other than that you're probably going to
be looking at like some lower pairs
so I I figured that like some of these
low
suited connectors if I did open them
are probably going to Barrel the turn
and on the river I think it's a
mandatory
mandatory Bluff
it's a boy where you can
do a bit of everything
you can Implement some big bets you can
Implement a lot of small bats
I don't think you want to play Big bet
only
or probably Reserve that for the
two-tone version of this port
you should check on the turn
to jam here with the Ace King versus 60
big blinds he goes for the block we have
an easy race so far everything's so
standard
uh what are we raising here
are we raising nines
erasing S8 if so half pot is probably
appropriate if not we only raise it 10
it's probably three quarters
I'm gonna go for a bigger race
you shoot a tune of x to nothing else
not sure
probably fold
I'll do 50 50.
just to prevent myself from making a big
mistake always same with the 98 I have
no clue in this rake structure if these
are calls yes or no
but they do both feel close so I'll roll
it if I make a mistake I only made the
mistake half of the time
being three is a call
probably twice
eight nine probably a fault the low
gutter for Street quarters
if it's pots which I think is a decent
like an appropriate bed size
uh what is better what is better and we
have a lot of purpose draw we have
jackets space we have Jack 10 for
example that's already better than Queen
3 we have Queen nine is better
between three is better than Queen six
king queen is better very close call
this 50 again because I honestly have no
clue
he was very close first button I think
he covers cut off there's an MP it's in
his fault first cutoff
it's just yeah it's very close
so then like I said calling it some of
the time
and you're not doing that
because you don't wanna okay maybe like
you're not doing that for the exact
solver considerations
but you're doing that simply because
you're not really sure
and you don't want your bias to
make you
always call always fault in this type of
spots because then your natural bias
will start to show
you might not have a leak in this exact
scenario but if always when it's close
you press fold or press call on the long
term it can become a leak
in terms of uh it's quite interesting
he
so we talked we think for quite a bit
actually on the turn we think about if
he would be thinking about what our
range is oh we probably have a hint
that's a bit like ours or we have
something like Jack 9 Jack 10. if we
don't balance our timing there I
definitely think we can uh we can give
away some information
here at the A7
you could do a couple of things here
A7 specifically I'm gonna go for a check
which is actually in hindsight a very
bad idea
my first instinct was to block but then
I thought oh maybe keep some Asics in
but that's obviously not a great idea
because if a river is an ace we have
three pair and three pair last time I
checked is not a very strong hand in
poke
I feel like now my head's just worth a
three-quarter
especially again he did
he sort of Snapchat turn I feel like
he's gonna have be very ace high or low
pair not even just ace high heavy
very hard to get value
but maybe I should have just adjusted my
sizing for the fact that I feel like
it's going to have a high way more often
with the Snapchat on the turn hi guys

in your poker career win7 suited easy
over call
Jack if
we know that this guy has seabating
range sometimes these are spots where if
he battles strong of his strongest on
the Flop and they both do that you can
step very wide here
not really sure if that's the case
which I'm gonna not go too crazy but I
think Queen Seven uh
definitely see a step here
making sense with how players usually
play
as hero
not really check back at Jack that often
and if he just also has a sea betting
range and that's too much jackass Plus
on the Flop and basically if it goes
checked around
I think as big plans we should do a lot
of stabbing so actually if I would play
this hand again I would have actually
liked the step so I think this is a good
example of
me not thinking about what are the
ranges and uh
yeah I feel like we should have just
stabbed this
and this is a spot where if you just
play on autopilot you check
if you actually think about what is
Fitness range and you try to start
paying attention
then you might actually find a stab
there on the turn to be very profitable
this hand can go either way I'm gonna go
for the call this time
versus The Jackal new guy that I have no
clue with this in the big blind so it
needs to be a bit more towards Cole
is Fault over day six easy check here
with the ace 9.
[Music]
all right
you can now probably start betting S9
Mr Gold did think about it for a little
while on the turn
[Music]
calls interesting
this tree
this board's starting to become a little
bit more
connected
then I think the board that we had
earlier where we're at the five six so
I'm actually going to be doing quite a
lot of checking here and betting big
Nana diamonds so
fine hand to make a big bet
big in this case for me is three quarter
I think we probably have a barrel
the nine is not great
but the king is
[Music]
so check back this is actually uh the
spot that we have discussed
where if the range is weaker we are way
more incentivized to bet
on the lab model
I feel like betting is okay
this is definitely a bit more
exploitative
because in theory the checkback range is
going to be way more protected
bolts
unfolding there is I mean
I was gonna say it's a thing but it's
not really a thing to be honest
and there's usually a consequence
because of the range
but let's say for example play versus no
offense I mean I don't know this player
but let's say I play versus a guy who I
know is a good player
uh I would definitely not have bad at
hand
[Music]
King three is turned 3x are actually
hands at the dead get bet
sometimes in a big bet I would prefer to
have a lower three
it's close I'll go for the uh
the check
by the lower three I would definitely
bet
but I feel like when we do check we
could maybe track race this in delay
but if it goes check check I think we
should just be checking down
though
pocket Force the recreation on the big
blind it's on the lower side
well it's 50 50.
and here check check bet
I'm tempted
seven eight
or quite deep again I'm gonna call this
50 50 we're being sucked in with the
[ __ ] pocket Force we're considering
folding
then we figured that 50 50 is probably
calm then we get squeezed 50 50 is
probably calm and that's um
that's how you get squeezed in
should have just folded in the first
place
green Jack if you think about Walt's
villains range there he bet it really
quick on the river
let's say he would have thought about it
a little bit more and throw it out like
a half pot it feels way more like eight
nines
tense
but now he was mainly going towards I
checked back at Queen twice or I have a
decent Jack
and I didn't really uh didn't really
believe the story
and again I also feel like in general
check back ranges
or the the the the passive ranges
tend to just be a little bit weaker
especially at uh
I'm calling this lower Stakes like
low to midsticks
I know it's not really low stakes and
the level here is very competitive but
he's talking about general population
Tennessee
374 again a board that's supposed to get
lead people the only then they basically
check range also be doing a lot of
checking visits
definitely one of them is Queen suited
versus Jam probably fault in these
positions German Reigns can definitely
contain Ace King Queens
I don't think we should be
we should be folding this hand
say it's close
or call this time
screen I'm gonna go for a call
back seats King five three four five
this Edge screen off I should have
probably three but in hindsight
but I might call him first caught up but
first epmp I think is going off
just always be a three bet
as played I think we have to just keep
on checking
rebelling the Queens
you could sometimes when you get very
deep and the guy here in the big blind
is 100 B deep you could sometimes call
basically back rays
and queens I think is a GM
I would say hence that you start calling
would be a bit lower like jacks or a bit
higher like kings the Queens is probably
the best hand to gem we're a bit deeper
though
actually a bit close Jackson thing is
always a call
things always generate something to go
extend the days queen and I played like
that
has to be said
not going to check race I expect the
recreational to three but the Flop way
more often than a professional
it would obviously not be great if that
happens with I4
and three betting here with Kings and
each turn
okay
who says I'm gonna go for the over call
actually lead this board why not
we have to try to donkey dunk from time
to time
and it's mainly because my overall range
here is gonna be
80 pocket pass between the deuce and the
eight yeah seems like quite a good board
for that
um or I could also have suited connector
like five for Suited
click on the turn Deuces is probably a
check without the club
wouldn't mind getting frisky with threes
eights would actually be the most sexy
hand
this is not very sexy
SK in this
deep tight I don't think getting an Ace
King here is gonna be a great idea I
think Ace King suited is actually going
to get it in some of the time
but
it rolls on the lower side so we're just
gonna call
asking other thing is definitely always
a call here
this is half but that
which actually is
Birds sizing on this board
gonna be doing a lot of jamming versus
half I would say but a skiing I think
I'm just gonna call and we can just call
any turn
ing on with our lives
if he checks
check
again I feel like if you feel like
what's his range this is a spot where
people I think are a bit unbalanced so
I'm gonna Jam
expect to get a lot of Falls
Theory you should definitely mix in a
lot of turn checks with strong hands
you're mainly going to be checking the
flush draw ones so let's say you have
Aces with the Ace of Heart Ace of clubs
Kings with the Ace of Heart Ace of clubs
you're going to be checking that on the
turn
you check quite fast and I feel like
you can just close your eyes and jam
there and get a lot of Folds
and the board is dead quote quote scary
people are just going to
be too too greedy with their value hands
and
not wanting you to pause control tense
Jack screens
you know not wanting to play a river and
they're just gonna be
jamming it in so I feel like under 20
checks you can just
bet your hand
7.5 I'm actually going to fold this end
some of the time
ruled higher
I'm going to call
tense I would probably never fall but
nines
eight seven sixes are definitely rules I
would say
I'll turn King we probably check
a lot
and nines is probably one of the persons
that we will be checking
this is not I don't think this is the
correct sizing from from his side
not sure actually
doesn't feel like it oh probably it is
you're trying to make all these pairs
without the spading different
now we can probably lead
this is a very weird hand
and if it raises it's full of [ __ ]
we got a call
what did he call it that is the question
it's King
all right it's three best faces called
four bets
I have this guy as a recreational
so far
standards nine of diamonds
it does make us uh pretty committed I
would say
checks again I would say the same thing
is true here as in the other Ace King
just gonna be very weak
so I'm just gonna spin my stack in and
expect to get a fold
and sometimes maybe a call from tense or
a nine or eight
is a recreational player Maybe
you could do to you could
turn over something random here
I would definitely encourage in a team
of uh the team of this topic in both
spots to the no Locker solver and see
what happens if people add a bit too
greedy and how the equilibrium changes
even calls with Ace King okay I figured
he would have a skin quite often but
that he calls it this next level
I guess he could
guess he could
[Music]
um
this is another spot where I feel like
the check race check line is going to be
very much
weighted to what it is just gonna be
like a turned Queen ax very often
and as soon as they don't balance these
lines I feel like we get we get to just
Battle of ASAC I do think actually I
made a mistake because I do feel like
then tense is now it's only worth way
more money
so the main the main thing that happens
if
if a range is unbalanced that we can
just bet the strength of our hand
and tense obviously is worth more than a
quarter and then if we have an ace with
just better quarter
okay Bernie my rate was wrong and he had
ACE check I guess
Ace jackets
it's actually also an interesting spot
that you can actually play in uh in
various ways
I want to get in too much details
not uh
the educate you guys but I'm not here
today every fan
but there's definitely some uh
alternative
strategies that I think are good here
timing here very important in this spot
check I'll check
this is definitely a spot the longer he
times the more I'm going to check behind
because it says something about his
range then
and I'm definitely folding here
especially with a club but also when the
age rolls off kind of Jack nine
but there's an interesting spot in terms
of the longer people
time
the less he just has Queen nine or King
10.
and the more it's like okay I have
a give up or I have a very strong hand
that I was considering
so uh the faster people check
the more
I want to evaluate my hand
and the longer people take
the more I want to check my hands
why is that because we Face a different
range and therefore we have different
equities and therefore we have different
incentives
as explained
I hope
this video has been useful for you guys
and
I promise you
when you go play sessions mainly with
this this question in mind
you'll suddenly see that you actually
know how to play poker at a higher level
no I'm saying this completely correct
incorrectly but
you suddenly
get broken out of your autopilot and
actually start to thinking to be honest
a lot in poker is just a matter of you
should start to think think logically
which is a part of the brain that gets
kind of shot off if you're just
assuming solver outputs
we got a cold call I don't know who this
guy is but I just started with a c bet
because my yeah my head's quite
beautiful
we'll definitely not see that a lot and
it suited could read three about this
maybe some of the time feels a bit weak
but hey let's go for it probably more
against the cutoff
very bad board for us
he calls
I'm not really sure
but
I'm gonna give up
and this is probably going to be a check
I'm gonna check this point very often
he's gonna step the sport very often
actually maybe do something
mergy here
it's not there not get too funkier
foreign
up I feel like the cold call versus
three bed range is just gonna contain
too much Ajax I can bet the term but
then it's just gonna jam and okay see
bet check
what's in his range well probably
sevenths or sixes or
five six Suited
something along those lines
very weekend
probably size down a bit get value from
those Holdings
[Music]
um
actually I'm just going to bed quarter I
think quarter is actually fine
because I think again the range is left
unprotected and he's just gonna have
sixes and sevenths the majority of the
time
in theory should definitely show up with
Queens for example Jax
and it's definitely not going to be the
case or at least not often enough versus
your average opponents and guess what he
had yeah
knowing that
man I probably blundered here myself
knowing that that he probably has pocket
sixes
um
we should probably have just been
actually a bit bigger
so I think I actually made a mistake
there
Queens
it's close I feel like it's a spot where
people are just gonna stab relentlessly
I do also
could actually also be a recreational
player if it's a recreational player I
definitely think checking towards him is
a good idea because they're just gonna
stab a lot
which is quite good for us here it is
nine could fail you bad but I think it's
a bit thinner said ace Jack I would
definitely tell you that
with a club and I'm just gonna call and
call River
you'd actually also lead the river I I
don't mind it with Queens specifically
blocking a lot of the Bluffs I feel like
he could have 10x that he's going to pot
control the river with so I'm actually
or nines I'm actually gonna take quite a
funky line here which I think is quite
decent actually versus a recreational
which you can use now your Queens as
a bluff catcher but it's a bit too
strong to use as a bluff catcher
I feel like we should just prevent
villain from pop controlling I feel like
that there there's more value in that
