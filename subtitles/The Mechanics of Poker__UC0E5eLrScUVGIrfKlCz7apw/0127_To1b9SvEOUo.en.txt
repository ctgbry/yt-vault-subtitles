okay this fellow guy is uh
very active i think it's time that he's
going to fuel my fire
[Music]
got a little announcement for you guys
because next to our mechanics of poker
program and master classes we have now
released the poker ambition academy in
this academy you will be receiving
weekly interactive webinars based on
your pain points we will be discussing
all areas that you can improve in to
become a more successful poker player
taught by coaches who have walked the
path that you are currently walking so
if you're interested go to the site and
looking forward to seeing you in the
academy setting up the tables never good
to go
for another wacko show
ah probably
just gonna say i'm probably gonna try a
little check raise here
turn this close
kind of depends on its flooding range
the more ace axis it contains the more i
want to check
on a low number
i'll guess how i'm not really sure so
then i'll revert back to the good old
rng
comes out with a small bat i don't think
i'm gonna race
it's an interesting bet though
don't really get it to be honest
i was thinking maybe about leading but
he should not really have too many hands
that i could now lead against
but the small sizing
does indicate that he could have so i'm
a little bit confused
versus any sizing non over bats we're
going to race and versus over bet we're
just going to call
and at the same hand that made a lot of
sense that exact hand
but i think he should have used a little
bit of a bigger sizing on the turn
i joined the zoom pool
you never know maybe it starts running
queen high board i think i'm just gonna
start off with a one third
it's an okay board from my range i would
say
which is gonna three bet a lot more
hands in the middling region
than he calls with he will have way more
pairs than i have and
usually as soon as there's two broadways
or at least connectivity with two
broadways
then uh
and usually you do well
starting off with the bat obviously
there's exceptions this is a little bit
more of a generalization turn i'm just
gonna continue betting i think half pot
is a fine sizing i think we want to
steal that
a pretty
wide range
as still he's gonna have a lot of
[ __ ] pairs
and on the river
probably
we are going to be splitting
i think it's ace nine
lower pressure probably hero car some of
the time
but he just had the ace queen suited
now that's quite unfortunate now isn't
it [ __ ]
all right
it's a good start
it's a very good start uh the queen
eight
i think i'm just gonna check towards the
recreational see if he does something
funky with uh very little equity
pixila everyone has purple as crazy
crazy maniac right
haha story checks out
like i said
has nothing to do with how good you are
easy cool
turn
it's a bit close
i've mixed mixed feelings on this type
of turns but sometimes i like to do
something funky like this
kind of depends on the recreational the
more information you have the better you
can play this line but i think this is a
fine default line that
very few people take
but you know it's dependent on a couple
of factors for the for the people who
follow the playlist on spotify record
time actually created another playlist
record time v2 because my playlist was
full
that's not good at it's not good
this can go either way
it's all checked
would say is check again
first miss evil smile
from hungary
that's an interesting river
as we made a set
but i see three blue cards
and a jack master straight
choosing means trouble in paradise
and he indeed had the king jack
i need to be a bit more aggressive in
these squeeze spots
and uh he's reasonably [ __ ] on this
board i would say this is a very good
board for us
the dos tutor i would have even went
smaller but i think now 20 is fine
i don't think there's very much he can
do
um if i would have a set
i wouldn't mind to start checking
but we don't have a set
so then i think burning again is good
and
i can probably
go on dirt i don't know if you guys are
at the bleep in the background but that
reminded me
to sit out
now we have a king a jack and a king
which usually means that you block the
whole calling range but the ranges in
this spot are a little bit different
so i guess i'm inducing some bluffs
do i induce bluffs
it's close
usually this kind of hands they like
checking
but the ranges are a little bit
different than normally as it's a
squeeze spot
yeah he had ace queen a screen a
swinging for example is a very likely
hand that calls the 2.2 and then calls
again
so then the question is
is is queen likelier to bluff
or to hero call
but actually i figured
ace queen yeah
was probably not calling and probably
also not bluffing
so then i was kind of hoping for
something like queen ten suited
here with the queens you could have a
couple of sizing i pro i usually on a
board like this just go for half but you
can mix it up
you can even include some bigger sizings
calls turn is a seven which
doesn't actually bother me all that much
but it probably normally i would go
three quarters but i think on the seven
i will size down a little bit i don't
think queens will check
i'll probably check my kings and aces
but i don't think i want to check queens
oh actually maybe that's uh that's
actually not true maybe it's actually
the i think it's that this was actually
a spot where kings
likes the bat and queens likes to check
so actually i think i butchered that one
in a master class we take the deepest
dive available out there into one
specific spot we will compare all the
strategies discuss all possible lines
discuss various textures talk about gto
and how to exploit your population
you're already further down your career
and there's just this one or two spots
that could need some extra work the
master classes are for you the master
classes are revised and improved content
directly from our cfp program so what is
the spot that you have most trouble
playing in
browse through the masterclass library
and fix those leaks
let's open up a little seven deuce
on the bottom
okay this fellow guy is
very active
so i think it's time that he's going to
fuel my fire
try them
i think it's good for poker like bring
some fun enjoyment
it's a good boot for us
in general you know king high boards are
quite good
start with a little bit
because
which it should actually not be do too
much calling here
i think
it is a little bit dicey
but i think i don't mind betting 20
again
given the fact that we have the [ __ ]
seven loose
and he falls
thank you sir thank you very much
this is how we do it feel the power
you feel my power baby
feel my power
to the power baby
um i'm gonna have some gems and some
clicks here
i would say queens is probably reserved
for the gem and not the click
kings and aces would click i think queen
just wants to jam
most of the time
oh we all win queen's going i seriously
because queens are i love yesterday
everything with queens he raised he had
he bro no king races we we're all in
baby we're all in this is it this is a
big moment of truth they said
either we wing everything or we lose
everything but
come on baby there we go tense is a good
hand for us
no
what the [ __ ] [ __ ]
the [ __ ] [ __ ]
i lost everything
okay we were unlucky guys
we uh
we
we managed to lose twice
further god damn son of a [ __ ] [ __ ]
bastard son of a [ __ ] [ __ ] why the
[ __ ] [ __ ] sucking hell does this
happen every [ __ ] time since i have
never used a solver of some kind of some
kind
what are we referring to of some kind
and i'm curious yeah you got to use the
solver
or not what what is the kind i'm curious
mr wreck punter what does what do you
mean with some kind
get through it on the flop okay so again
some weird spots are coming up
pretty cool
the problem with having jack queen is
like
it's a dilemma because his most likely
flop three bet is probably gonna bluff
i mean it's probably gonna be something
with a five like five four or something
definitely still calling the term
we're getting put into spots today
i'm making it default where's the
chicken sound for myself
[Music]
trivia what the [ __ ] it is we get a cold
call here we get punished by you know
being captain all okay
come on then do something funky then no
of course not [ __ ] then why don't you
do anything funky boy
traverse traverse travis has not been
that aggressive so i'll just start off
with a c bet
here
we get an overcall from a for a living
i think with with the heart we should
definitely keep on betting so that's
what i'm gonna do here we're definitely
going with the five six suited gonna
flop something amazing
unfortunately we didn't
or at least you know cannot complain
it's a gutter
it's a gutty gutty that's not a great
goodie so i think i'm just gonna call
in terms of we don't have the back to
flashlight to go with our hands
oh
[Music]
[ __ ]
9 2
11 22.
which bluff though
so close
ah
we are getting
hammered today
hammered
absolutely hammered
i indeed agree i don't think i played
that hand well i should have at least
considered that i think it's either
a check call or a block
whereas now i just checked decided which
is very much not in line with my
philosophy
my philosophy usually wants to decide
check instead of checking the site so
that i didn't play that hand well
so i agree youtube making a small bit on
the river is definitely better
here
when the six connects
i think i'm going to check
my triple d trips
checks as well i think
i'm just gonna rip it in and go to bed
guys ship it in and go to bed you know
it's time to ship it in and go to bed
but with a little bit of a less sat on
my face than mr howard does
i was thinking about it
so if he thinks about it for this long
he's at least going to call some of the
time so that means the gem is okay
also if we bluffed here it means that
the atleast would fall some of the time
which also is good
little seven to shoot it
let's go for it
what the [ __ ] not
bump it up
[Music]
we actually flop a bear this is uh
it's not bad
it's more than we more than we wish
we're even back to flusher to go with it
damn life is good
okay even turn the deuce
jack jack
what are we doing at jack
what do we do on a jack
what do we do in a jack
probably check with a seven
actually i thought actually he was gonna
bluff that
seven deuce
never lose
