do you want to know what is inside the
mechanics of poker program go over to
the site where you can watch a

[00:15]
the site where you can watch a
free one hour demo what's up what's up
yo yo yo yo yo say yo yo yo
welcome guys
to the wacko show i'm the wacko this is

[00:31]
to the wacko show i'm the wacko this is
my show
hello echo's dog name is bella
because she's very bella that's how it
goes
and i have the video and where i left it
off last time

[00:45]
off last time
did you guys learn something from last
uh who was here last
last week as well for the first part
pretty soft lineup
you would definitely sit down i it would
be a nice game to play
give us a look at the right the goal was

[01:02]
give us a look at the right the goal was
to
at least before the end of the year
again shot at 10k would be a nice shot
it would definitely be a nice shot wacko
when i watch your videos intro the
course it seems like your coaching is
radically different
from other coachings would you agree hey

[01:16]
from other coachings would you agree hey
steve
i did not pay you to say this but i
could have but indeed it is way
different
i mean the reason why i decided to make
a product is because
i saw all the products out there and

[01:30]
i saw all the products out there and
i am a very disappointed customer of
most coaching products
and i was like guys come on what the
[ __ ] are you guys all talking about
this is not how poker works but then i
said okay you know
i can probably make something better and
here we are hey we have a follower again

[01:46]
here we are hey we have a follower again
guys shout out to high stakes poker real
did i say that correctly high stakes
poker stream
go follow them on twitch if you want to
see this video back
and we might see a lead here on the turn
now actually we didn't see elite

[02:00]
now actually we didn't see elite
this is actually a spot that people over
the years have started leading
in general the turn leading concept has
been a little bit over blight people
actually leading range in a lot of
paired scenarios this is definitely
uh not the correct strategy but there's

[02:15]
uh not the correct strategy but there's
again hands that benefit from the
concept of leading okay why would you
lead in eight for example well that's to
prevent stefan from pot controlling
okay just an example stefan
decides to barrel this spot is also
interesting in terms of do
did you give if you look at the sim did

[02:31]
did you give if you look at the sim did
you give the out of position
a dog batting range yes or no if you
didn't your barrel frequency imposition
will go down
if you did then lions will already let
some uh 8x and his range becomes a
little bit more heavily to
weighted towards an ace so for example

[02:46]
weighted towards an ace so for example
and like ace 10 a's jack
will bet at a higher frequency this is
something again
in terms of solvers not just copying the
outcome because these kind of factors
play a big part right
it's making the optimal solution versus

[03:01]
it's making the optimal solution versus
the range
that has been checked to him so if you
gave it a dunk or not that will have a
big impact
on how the spot is going to play and it
looks like line is called the barrel
here
so linus's range is very heavily
weighted now towards an

[03:16]
weighted now towards an
ace maybe that he decides to check all
some of his weaker 8x
that's definitely an option that he
decides for example okay i will lead
some of my stronger adax and check some
of my weaker a decks
maybe that isn't uh that is an option

[03:30]
maybe that isn't uh that is an option
because also let's say yes 87
stefan has more ace king whereas if he
has king 8
7 has less ace king so let's see what's
going to happen
i would expect stefan now to definitely
be throwing out some big bets as i think

[03:45]
be throwing out some big bets as i think
linus could definitely have already
let an ace on the turn check raised an
ace and eight on the turn
so i think his range is very much
weighted towards a weaker ace and stefan
definitely has the advantage now in
terms of an eight in terms of an ace
so i would expect a lot of aggression

[04:01]
so i would expect a lot of aggression
here from stefan
so let's see is stefan indeed gonna fire
a lot of aggression
indeed he goes for pot this is actually
also something that we saw quite often
this is actually something i don't

[04:15]
this is actually something i don't
personally don't use a lot of potting
i usually go 75 or over bed but there's
definitely a couple of spots where i
think it made a lot of sense
uh i remember the ace jack from mikey
boyfin
and i think this is again a similar
situation where yes we have an advantage

[04:31]
situation where yes we have an advantage
but are we really going to over bet ace
queen
for 150 pot maybe not really
so i think this way maybe actually in
this spot i would say a slight
over could still be okay but there's
obviously still a chance that lioness

[04:45]
obviously still a chance that lioness
has
some 8x so i think again pot is a good
sizing here
um and this is also like you can see in
my thought process as well i'm looking
at
what sizing makes most sense with the
range that i'm betting so how do you
come up with the sizing in a certain
situation

[05:00]
situation
it's to evaluate your range and the type
of hands you're betting
okay this is how i for example also
start to say
oh there's a there's a split strategy
here we samples that big something's a
bit small that's because
if you look at certain hands in your
range they will benefit from

[05:15]
range they will benefit from
the ev generated by a small bet or buy a
check and other hands
um generate a lot of ev in a big bet and
i see hands in our range
some hands benefit from small some hands
benefit from big so they automatically
know that there's a split

[05:30]
know that there's a split
stefan is a no knit don't believe this
guy
and he called down with so the triple
okay definitely no chicken sound for
stefan here
it was seven nine versus eight queen if

[05:47]
it was seven nine versus eight queen if
i'm not mistaking
yeah ace queen up for for lioness in the
big blind and seven nine for stefan
basically
this is kind of what i was saying i
think what stefan is trying to do here
he kind of assumed that lower eight

[06:00]
he kind of assumed that lower eight
eight acts
might not lead the turn um so
he now has very good blockers to his
best 8x basically
which are his lower 8x so that's why he
tripled off obviously he also has
um quite a lot of

[06:17]
um quite a lot of
from from his range perspective he has
quite a lot of strong hands and it's
he's unfortunate in my opinion that he
runs into the top
of linus's range because basically i
think stefan could still use this sizing
with ace queen himself

[06:31]
with ace queen himself
so yeah big linus has a call believe me
these guys
okay this is how you should see poker
this is also actually a reason why i
like to play in big blinds
it's just ammunition guys it's a war
you have a gun the other guys have a gun

[06:45]
you have a gun the other guys have a gun
you've been handed ammunition which is
your money
and you're just gonna shoot and hope to
shoot out your opponent okay there's
nothing anywhere to do with money
linus is triton interview set same thing
that he enjoys hats up with
rex or 300 rather than bomb hunting vips

[07:02]
rex or 300 rather than bomb hunting vips
yeah and this has everything to do with
he's not playing the game for the money
right he's playing the game for a
challenge
and he doesn't feel motivated to play
versus recreational players

[07:17]
versus recreational players
you could say that's a leak i remember
liking this guy shout out to linus
when lions moved up
six years ago probably right so i was
playing
510 as well and like some five now zoom

[07:32]
510 as well and like some five now zoom
and linus was also playing
uh those games and then basically people
would battle
right to get the tables to get the
lobbies
so we were playing 300 or 400 then the
recreational joined the game
who would leave the [ __ ] game linus

[07:46]
who would leave the [ __ ] game linus
and lions would start a new 300 game
and everyone said lioness was [ __ ]
crazy
okay he was doing something completely
different than what the rest was doing
he already guessed it he also got
results that were different

[08:00]
results that were different
than what the rest was doing so in
general
if you do what everyone does you will
get what everyone has
if you do something that's out of the
ordinary okay you change your approach
like linus did two things can happen
either you crash and burn because your
approach will simply

[08:16]
approach will simply
worse or your process indeed better and
your results will be way higher than
these other players right
but it's always it's hard to go against
the norm this is in general also with
your approach to poker strategy for

[08:30]
your approach to poker strategy for
example what i struggled with a lot
in my career especially in the in the
earlier years
when i was a little bit lower in
confidence i would think
like for example for a long time i was
using a strategy where i would
just double uh double the double the

[08:46]
just double uh double the double the
razor's opening and would just follow it
up with a minbat for example because i
figured hey
you know these small sizings i kept this
range right and now he cannot really
defend
but there were not no solvers back in
the time to give me that confirmation
for example i was one of the fewer

[09:00]
for example i was one of the fewer
players that started limping in the
small blind that was something that i
intuitively thought
was a good play and you know there's
many other strategies
that i at that moment felt like were
good
but the rest weren't doing but
i often because of a little bit low

[09:15]
i often because of a little bit low
confidence would just go back to what
everyone
else was doing because basically what i
was saying is you guys are all wrong
okay you guys don't understand how the
game is played i think this is better
you need a lot of confidence so shout
out to lions guys he had the confidence
he was like listen guys

[09:30]
he was like listen guys
you guys are hanging with the fish i
have a bigger vision for this game
i'm gonna quit when the fish comes and
come battle me again three four-handed
and we were the losers that that kept
every time falling for the trap and play
lightest three-handed
which i've gave many times the

[09:46]
which i've gave many times the
suggestion not to do unless you like the
game like stefan and mike
boyfinder that was a very long run
stefan going with this big oh and this
time actually went for three quarters we
saw him use bigger sizings on other
boards
definitely a board that he could also
bet bigger especially because it's

[10:02]
bet bigger especially because it's
rainbow
i have about experience with because i
learn better from free content
free content i'm trying more to figure

[10:15]
free content i'm trying more to figure
out why action is correct
actually it's scientifically proven that
if you pay for pay for something
especially when it becomes a little bit
more expensive you're more likely
to soak up the information

[10:32]
to soak up the information
yeah i find it hard to focus on 40 to 60
minute videos and courses yet
i could talk one-on-one about poke for
hours definitely understand that i've
tried to make
my make my program ass because i
i feel you man man there's so many

[10:46]
i feel you man man there's so many
products out there that i cannot stand
watching after 10 minutes i'm already
done
uh i tried
in everything that i make
a lot of things are gonna be new to you
okay it's a completely different way of
looking at the game in my opinion

[11:02]
looking at the game in my opinion
i've also tried to as you
notice in love the twitch stream i try
to
put a lot of energy into it and give my
passion through
what i'm doing in this case twitching

[11:16]
what i'm doing in this case twitching
i've done the same in the program
i've added a little bit of humor in
there yeah i i try to make the viewer
experience as nice as possible
okay um and i think we did a very good
job on that
or i just like myself watching or like

[11:31]
or i just like myself watching or like
to just watch myself back
that's also an option actually stefan
decided to go for a check it's
definitely a turn that
you will have a quite a high barreling
frequency um
yes i think actually gonna fold the
river i was gonna say maybe as king

[11:45]
river i was gonna say maybe as king
deuce or something uh but even king
is probably inclined to barrel i think
he uh
maybe had a hand like a6
nah that's not a hand check six ten
six ten six of spades or something and

[12:01]
six ten six of spades or something and
seven of spades
but rekko give us something first to
improve so i can afford the mechanics
yeah
and that is exactly the whole point of
the uh of the
of the academy right basically

[12:18]
of the academy right basically
if you have a company like poker
ambition
what you're trying to do is you're
trying to offer a range of products
that someone can come in when they just
learn poker as a game till the most

[12:32]
learn poker as a game till the most
advanced level right
that's in the end a mission i think most
companies will have
they want to offer something to the
range you come in at the beginning of
poker mission
and if you like our services like your
products you're more likely to stay
and you're more likely to uh

[12:47]
and you're more likely to uh
to purchase other products right this is
a benefit for both the company
and a benefit for both the student
because you're here
you've improved and therefore you're
naturally gonna stay within pokebitch
and to look for the next step right
because you have a positive experience

[13:01]
because you have a positive experience
we have a loyal customer so it's a
win-win for both parties
okay so we have three products like
twitch youtube um then we have the
academy which will be cheaper and then
we have the mechanics
still a big jump in between but i

[13:16]
still a big jump in between but i
definitely think at some point you have
to take that leap
actually we have master classes in
between but masterclass is more
of a specialization where the mechanics
is
really explaining you all the
fundamentals how poker works then in a
masterclass i zoom in on this very
specific spot so you would get very good

[13:31]
specific spot so you would get very good
in that specific spot
a lot of concepts will return
but i think it will less benefit you if
you haven't already seen the mechanics
i first actually wanted to make it in a
way that you had to have bought the
mechanics in order to

[13:45]
mechanics in order to
enroll for the masterclass because i
think that's the way to go but yeah i
would be uh
as they say in holland a thief of my own
wallet if i would do that
why would i make why would i have a
product that people cannot buy
so my own idealism if that is a word got

[14:02]
so my own idealism if that is a word got
in there
would have gotten in the way there
but actually i'm planning on uh um
adding oh actually we do actually now
get a magic bad over bet

[14:16]
get a magic bad over bet
that's quite funky
so i really don't get this play
you know sometimes you have a couple of
these scenarios where you have no
[ __ ] clue what's going on
tell me guys what the [ __ ] is going on

[14:30]
tell me guys what the [ __ ] is going on
here
we nee we need your help bro what do you
guys think stefan is up to so
he better three quarters on the flop
check the turn and now over bets the
river
okay but help me out there guys

[14:45]
okay but help me out there guys
what the [ __ ] over i never really
understand the magic bet over bet in
this kind of scenarios
ace king but i would probably still just
prefer to bet
because basically linus can still have
three is forest
nines queen nine king nine these are all

[15:01]
nines queen nine king nine these are all
hands that we cannot have anymore
now he doesn't have another advantage
that's kind of the problem right king
nine is very likely to barrel turn i
would say
stefan probably also doesn't have 10
jack that's probably one of the first
hand that you would bear on the turn

[15:17]
for example if he would have barreled
the turn hey by all means man
go go go go go completely bananas
because indeed you have the 10 jack but
now it's very weird
so i would i would say this is a bluff i

[15:30]
so i would i would say this is a bluff i
would go for like like i said i would
stick with my initial read with 10 6
suited or something
or yes ace king stefan guy is crazy yeah
feel the power you feel my power baby
feel my power feel my power liners feel

[15:47]
feel my power feel my power liners feel
my power
this was actually an interesting spot a
spot that we talked about earlier as
well
mike and boyfin decided to go for a big
sizing on the turn
and we saw here linus going for a very
big sizing as well

[16:01]
big sizing as well
this is a you could even go a little bit
bigger i would say
definitely again a deeper stacked
concept to increase your bed sizing here
and we start to see some pop bedding
here this is actually a nice spot to pot
i think it was mikey boyfriend called

[16:15]
i think it was mikey boyfriend called
flop and on the turn was check two i
like pot exercising
and river is quite interesting i
wouldn't uh
three quarters of pot i would say fine
sizings
i would personally size down to three

[16:30]
i would personally size down to three
quarters but oh wow he lost versus
stabilization guys this is it
this is it this is what we've all been
waiting for
[Music]
i mean if you lose ace deuce that has to
be a chicken song right what is

[16:45]
be a chicken song right what is
your definition okay so i'm gonna come
because this is
this is classic uh this is this was also
my point we saw
a lot of different actions
okay in my opinion
there is no best poker player there's

[17:02]
there is no best poker player there's
only
your definition of being your best
so let's say for example if linus's goal
is
um that he wants to make the most money
possible out of poker
and he should maybe we could argue

[17:17]
and he should maybe we could argue
that there's better ways to do this
right
uh assuming that battling three-handed
with mike and boyfriend stefan has
nothing to do with that
um but if his goal is to just be the
best online poker player

[17:30]
best online poker player
and able to beat everyone then his
actions are in line with his goals
so he's on the right path so there is
actually no correct answer that's only
what is important for you
because in the end if you succeed so
let's say for example you make the most
amount of money possible because you

[17:46]
amount of money possible because you
hunt fish
but you feel really bad about yourself
because
in your true heart you feel like
battling these guys
is more satisfaction it should give more
satisfaction to you right
it's important to you it's in your

[18:00]
it's important to you it's in your
values then you filled in your poker
career basically right
if you guys understand what i mean and
here we face a race
this is some serious action

[18:15]
this is some serious action
uh no actually just a three bet and a
race there's a bigger sizing
this one is quite interesting because
they're quite deeper they're
um interesting what mikey is gonna

[18:31]
um interesting what mikey is gonna
race stack off here i don't know a good
combo draw
are you gonna race jax now i would just
prefer to call same with tense
getting intense feels a little bit loose
88 plus i mean yeah

[18:47]
88 plus i mean yeah
it's possible i guess especially also
versus the bigger sizing you know
there's already
3.6 k in the pot
i'm just not really sure the fact that
we're 120

[19:00]
we're 120
five bb deep i would definitely up
my character my my i wouldn't go for
eight personally
seven deuce diamonds shout out to the
seventies diamonds
any update on the academy release date

[19:15]
any update on the academy release date
end of july i would say
h4 off guys it's not in there because
it's the three web bots
yeah a gem here should include quite a
lot of uh
high card type of holdings like ace
queen ace king especially no diamonds

[19:31]
so he just race calls off a naked flush
draw
and raises walks into kings what do we
think guys what do we think
i mean he's blocking tents and jacks and

[19:45]
i mean he's blocking tents and jacks and
he can fold out hands like king jack
and he's his mo i i get it like his the
most likely
re-raises of stefan are gonna be ace
queen a skin type of holding so he has
life cards versus those
it's unlikely as gens and jax basically

[20:00]
it's unlikely as gens and jax basically
just run into worst case scenario
it's one of these spots that may seem a
little bit optimistic but this is also

[20:15]
little bit optimistic but this is also
something that bigger sizings force from
stefan
um so yeah
i i think it's just pushing equity
it seems maybe a little bit spewy but
definitely with dan jack i like it
if you if he would do this with king

[20:30]
if you if he would do this with king
queen i would not like it or queen jack
but then jack i like sp
particularly guys thank you a lot see
you in the next stream on tuesday where
we're gonna be back
