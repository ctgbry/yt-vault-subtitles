high-stakes tournament player has uh
various as one various tournament both
live and online dutch uh goes by the
name bill lewinsky online known as euros
rice in the netherlands adam what are
you looking forward to with this guest
first of all i'm very excited that this
is our first episode myself and renee
have been putting this concept out there
for a while we finally got round to
getting our first guest and yeah i guess
it took a long time eight years to go
from the lower stakes through to the
high stakes so i'm really intrigued to
know what obstacles he had to overcome
on that journey from a mindset
perspective i want to know what skills
mentally and performance wise he's had
to develop to get to the top and yeah
he's a very smart guy so i'm looking
forward to uh picking his brains on some
topics and seeing what lessons we can
distill in a very coherent and usable
way for the audience so how about you
rename what you're interested in
i'm very curious especially in terms of
how he yeah how he approaches poker
right i mean i'm a poker player myself
so that's naturally what my curiosity
will lean towards uh
you know seeing what kind of things he
tries to do in order to stay ahead of
the competition how we approach studying
the game all these kind of things so uh
i would say without further ado let's
bring euros on
welcome yours to the first episode of
the podcast
thank you welcome everyone
couldn't have wished for a better first
guest you were number one on my list so
very happy that we could have made this
work
i'm um we're just gonna start straight
off i'm uh curious as you mentioned to
us
before we started the recording that
basically before poker you were already
into playing like strategic games and
stuff could you maybe elaborate a little
bit more on that to the to the audience
i mean like uh
um
the strategic games are always like a
fun thing to me
like uh
i mean like sort of at the launch of the
internet you would have like a lot of
these
sort of really geeky text-based games
and like it's really hardcore and art
stuff like
i don't know like the runescape and uh
and i i would just be
in love with computers from a very young
age basically
and the strategic games were like a sort
of a way to spend like a lot of time
behind the computer and play around with
numbers a lot which i seem to enjoy
and um
so yeah then i became quite good at that
stuff
i don't know why
just like a large time investment i
guess
and
and just having like a natural
uh natural good perception of numbers so
i used to play that a lot
before i found poker lately
a natural good perception of numbers
definitely a skill that you've probably
managed to transfer into your poker
career i assume
yeah yeah of course
like i mean um
it's it's it's not that i'm like a math
genius or anything
uh
it's
it's it's hard to describe but like if
you ask me to give like an estimate of
something say how many windows are there
in new york or something like you know
like like just a really big abstract
numbers question
i i would come up with a pretty decent
answer
how many windows are there in new york
yours routes the audience wants to know
i would have to have a bit of time to do
to do like a proper calculation but i go
like all right there's uh what was there
like 40 million people in in new york
so you go like
how many windows does an average house
have well i'd say about you know like
new york they're small apartments so
let's say about four to five average
because there's like a lot of houses
with just one window and then a couple
of houses with a bunch of windows of
course
so uh yeah i'd say somewhere around 80
80 to 100 million windows
all right you heard of their first 80 to
100 billion windows in new york
so taking this uh uh this this
skill for numbers you know you were uh
already playing a lot of online games
then you got into touch with poker at
some point what was it then about i
assume that dennis was
like okay the games were kind of taking
a second place and you were starting to
play more online poker what was it about
poker that was
so much i would say better
or so much nicer to do than the other
games that you were playing
uh i mean i i guess there was like a
really fun
psychological element also the fact that
like
you know the fact that it was for real
money it really added like some sort of
extra level of pressure extra level of
excitement
uh this idea that you know
nobody would uh
play like if you're playing just a
regular game i don't know if you've ever
had this but you play like a regular
game with your family and two people
they don't really care like the game
they came all of a sudden is no longer
interesting you know like if you know
if not every every participant is sort
of trying their hardest
it becomes much less interesting and the
thing with pogba is like once people put
up their money people
really care and they really really care
about the outcome and the results and
about playing good
so yeah i thought the element of it was
very interesting and then of course it
started making me a bit of money
which was also
an interesting aspect to an 18 year old
me who was
consistently out of money
like
that
yeah i mean if if you were going to get
addicted to some video game which i
think a lot of our listeners including
myself were at some point right in in
their when they were younger
it's it's pretty handy that that game
actually earns you money instead of the
opposite way around
yeah yeah for sure and that's that's
sort of where
a lot of the
addiction turns into workaholicism or
like being a workaholic for a lot of
people is like
there's like
this really close boundary between uh
you know like if if you play a lot of
poker and you lose a bit of money people
will see you as an addiction and if you
play a lot of vocal and win a bit of
money and people see it as like that's a
real professional job you can actually
do it yeah there's a very thin line
thin line between dedication gamble
addiction
game addiction
workaholic
so you would say it determines the the
outcome determines the definition
basically
for society yeah for sure like uh i mean
that's that's basically how society
views it i think it's like if you're if
you're successful at something then it
becomes
uh an asset and if you're
unsuccessful at something it becomes an
addiction
i i think also a lot of people can
relate to that
playing poker for play money doesn't
work it's not the same right and that's
kind of that care factor that that that
you've been mentioning
now yeah unless you move up to like
really high
uh play money stakes like there's
there's there's like
i think there's like this whole niche
community of like
really good players that play for play
money and they play really high stakes
and that's actually a really hard level
to get to get to
so then people actually you know really
care
i mean even though it's not about money
there's like such a huge time investment
and such a huge
sort of status investment for them that
they actually care about
did you grind through those play money
levels yourself to get to the the high
stakes play money
no no no but when i first started
playing poker i i did do sort of half
and half play money and
normal money just to to try out a bit
and to try out different softwares and
to see what was going on
and uh i actually enjoyed
back then when i just started out i
actually enjoyed to play money streets
and build up a bit of a role there
but uh but yeah it quickly became a bit
quickly became much more exciting to be
uh
to be playing for real money
i guess when you start realizing right
that
people are the other people at the table
aren't taking it as serious as you are
and you want to play quote quote good
poker right and then you just people
have people just oh open open shelf just
go in three way you're like this is no
fun let's go to the real money tables
because at least there you know
the game becomes a little bit more
strategic you would you would yeah yeah
and this is just the level of excitement
it's like that's still true for me today
is like if you play a higher stakes
tournament it's sort of more fun it's
like there's just a higher level of
excitement
you sort of crave the pressure a bit
like you sort of crave me
uh
caring about the result more and more so
yeah i mean that's the still holds up
i feel like also at some point if you
reach really high stakes it for some
people it starts to feel like play money
again
yeah
like at some point you you reach a level
especially of recreational players that
just have billions that they pretend
like it's play money again and then
you would almost say like for example
would you say that an average
recreational or will at higher stakes is
probably bigger than admit stakes
yes and no like uh
like usually these people like even if
the money means nothing to them they
they still really care about
uh how they're performing or like what
what sort of the result is like
they also make a time investment they
make an emotional investment you know
like
i mean i don't know how it is for cash
but like for tournaments specifically
you know like
if even if a guy has a really big will
and and he managed to make day three for
example he still spent like two two days
holding on to his tax two days
you know performing in that tournament
so like even if the money means nothing
to him he still cares about
uh whatever the result is of that of
that investment
so like uh
yeah i mean i wouldn't and i wouldn't
say that wills are bigger
i
i don't know like that that would be
very nice
but
i mean they they also come with like
like wheels and higher sticks they come
with a different skill set that
sometimes can make it a lot harder to
play against
that's definitely true and i i do in the
degree that especially the time
investment if you go and play a
tournament
there's probably a difference here in
cash games and tournaments as well i
would say but going back to
when you just started playing out and
what you also said with the play money
right it really feels like a game
because you can
collect a certain amount of chips to get
to the next level
so
when you started out you played a little
bit of play money then a little bit of
real money
when at some point i guess you let go of
play money you know that was no longer
in your aspirations i guess
did you then just start at like the
lower stakes and just look like hey
interesting i can gather this amount of
chips or money or points however you saw
it at that time to get to the next stake
the next take or were you
or were you just playing and taking it
day by day
yeah i mean though that wasn't really
like a like a conscious plan or
something that was not like a
sort of goal set out like okay this is
the level i'm at now this is the level i
want to reach like i was just sort of
you know just playing
making a bit of money than losing a bit
of money again and going following a bit
of the ups and downs
and uh
yeah so so
uh
i mean and and i let go of the play
money quite quickly it's not like i
spent ages there but uh but yeah like
it was just it was just fun like it was
just like a
way to spend some time for some
enjoyment it was like i i sort of really
enjoyed
figuring out the strategic dynamics like
pretty quickly i found like a lot of
resources some videos about other people
playing like
uh you know some articles on the
internet and i started trying to
incorporate that
i just thought
the process of that was super
interesting and and so and that's
actually that held true for like a long
long time throughout my career is that i
just i just really enjoyed the game and
there was never like a moment like
all right this is where i need to be or
this is where i want to go that only
came in like the last few years actually
and like uh for a long time it was just
you know just something that i did and
that i really enjoyed and
like the
fun element for me was also like uh
one of the reasons i think i was able to
to evolve as a player and and to stay
consistent and to stay focused for us is
because it was never it was never about
it was never totally about the money it
was always like
the enjoyment of just playing was so
beautiful
i can definitely
relate strongly to that so
there was
that was there at some point the
conscious decision like okay now i'm
turning pro or that is did it just
kind of happen it's like you were like
oh i guess i've been pro for the last
six months
no i mean like uh
there was a moment where
uh like i finished high school
i was about to start my studies and i
was working like part time as a
as a chef in a restaurant
and i was spending quite a lot of time
there and actually really enjoying it
but uh you know like the the
hours i would not work i would just make
so much more money so i sort of you know
slowly phased out the
the side work
and then pretty quickly after that like
pretty quickly after i sort of placed it
out
i mean i was playing tournaments so i
won like i had like a really big score
it's like a really big thing like that i
won like a 100k in one night when
my bankroll was like 8k or something
or 7k so like at that point it was like
all right
now it just doesn't feel like
now there's just no sense in going back
to eight
or nine euros an hour
once you have that amount of money in
the bank yeah especially in tournaments
when you make a bing like that you know
you're just hooked right it's like okay
this is this is the new reality you know
this is being a poker player i'm gonna
bring 100k on a monthly basis
yeah
was it kind of a maybe an illusion that
you might have or at least if i speak
for myself in the beginning it was just
like oh poker easy now you make money
100 100
like uh
like the
the first bank was just such a trip
because like
i mean my biggest score before that was
like 6k
and then i played like a sunday and i
won one tournament for 11k
and it was back then there was no day
twos or anything so tournaments would go
on forever and like uh so it was like
1am and i won like 11 or 12k or
something and i was like whoa this is
really sick this is like a really big
amount of money
and then there was still one w coupe
tournament that was in
and so the same day somewhere it's like
2 p.m
i'm not on the monday because because
you have because there was no day two so
tournaments would play for like 24 hours
or something
and uh
i ended up at like a huge final table
like a like a w cooked version of the
sunday million
um game like fifth for 95k or something
something something crazy like that
uh
and at that point i just felt like oh my
i
i'm on top of the world and that's like
a sort of a high i stayed in for a long
time
and then it it sort of turned into this
thing where
i just had completely unrealistic
expectations about you know what my
expectation expected value in a year
would be what my expected value in a
tournament would be i
made some pretty big mistakes and
if i could look back on it now there's
some great mental advice i would give
myself oh uh this is uh this is uh
indeed a podcast about uh reflecting
right looking back so that's definitely
something that we're going to do
i'm sure adam adam has you know a
performance coach was listening like why
you can play 24 hours then you can find
the table performance why is that much
softer a little bit right i i haven't
checked the recent studies on sleep but
i heard something about your sleep
deprived is the same as if you're drunk
at some point
yeah i'd say playing 24 hours is going
to have some serious cognitive
decline but the good news is the rest of
the fields are also suffering so you got
to out survive the rest of them which is
yeah the hard job into whoever is best
playing drunk basically yeah at some
point yeah
so yeah years it sounds like
yeah it's so crazy that they used to do
that like like for a long time like like
like the four the first four years of my
career the first four five years of my
career like there were just basically no
day twos and tournaments in online
tournaments
so like tournaments would regularly run
for 18 to like
like 18 to 24 hours or something
and then like i mean i was i was very
young back then i was like 18 19 20. so
that was a big advantage for sure is
that i could just stay up all night and
and
uh
you would have like these absolute
meltdowns
uh in late stages and tournaments of
people just either falling asleep or
just really
being unable to focus or process
information or anything like that it's a
very interesting difference between
mtt's and cash games uh because
you're basically your bnc game have to
just be so much better in tournaments
because you just play so long hours like
if i've played three hours of cash games
i'm like it's time for a break because i
don't feel sharp anymore but in a
tournament yeah it doesn't work like
that
i have turned on tournaments is crazy
crazy performance wise
like uh i mean there's also the element
of like
your b and c game just have to be very
good because
uh you can't just decide all right it's
not my session today i'm gonna quit or
something like like there's this very
hard unrest on registering a tournament
once it started so like uh
yeah
i mean it's also some like an aspect
that i really neglected for a long time
because i was just so naturally good at
it because i would just
have this this ability to focus for like
really long periods and to stay sharp
for really long periods
but then uh
yeah
then i sort of found out that
like that that capacity to do that was
sort of declining
and uh the
the need for it became more uh
i mean how to say it became more it
became a more important factor
because it's because like back then
there was just like such a huge skill
gap if you were just
you know slightly into to the material
and into the weeds you would just be so
much better than the rest
so like uh how how you would perform
mentally and stuff
was less important because because you
could just
it was just so easy basically
and
[Music]
lately that skill gap has really closed
down
and like
so then the performance becomes so much
more important
yeah yeah i got a curious question in
line with that so it sounds like when
you first got into poker it was for the
fun it was enjoyable game and you were
very competitive and you didn't really
think about the money but you were
making money but then it seems like a
big transition happened when you had
that big 100k score and then it sounds
like your expectations started to get a
bit carried away see i just wanted to
talk about that that chapter of your
life where all of a sudden you're now in
a position where you've got a hundred
thousand plus role you're a 20 year old
kid how did that change your
relationship with the game and what
happened after that moment
um i don't know like i became very
competitive
like uh there was a sort of this desire
within me to
to show that i'm not i wasn't like a
one-score wonder or something like
um so yeah i started competing at higher
stakes
which probably wasn't a great idea at
the time but
i learned a lot from it actually
like it sort of gave me it gave me a bit
of learning money
and
i also treated it like that a bit
because i started playing like heads-up
cash a bit because i really enjoyed it
and i really enjoyed like the the
challenge of
you know the one-on-one battle
uh
you know
of course playing heads up is very
exciting because you just get to play so
many hands in so many interesting spots
so yeah i would just sit anybody at 2 4
5 10
see what happens and uh and
obviously i i mean i didn't lose like a
huge amount but i lost i lost a little
bit uh back to the
to the high stakes community but i
actually got in like a really decent
amount of volume which uh which made me
a lot like
which may be a lot better player like
that was like a huge
boost in my in my ability and my skill
and uh but yeah in tournaments there was
a sense like even after 100k i i i did
very well and i think i went to like a
prolonged period of like
a really like a combination between like
a really sick upswing
and the fact that i was actually you
know i wasn't very good
but i was doing things that uh that was
working really well against the people i
was playing
like like there was not like a sort of
really
good strategic framework or that was not
really like a
i didn't have like
a very good sense of what poker was
about or or how to be better at poker
but i was just doing a lot of things
that were working really well
i was just playing hyper aggressive you
know like like really pushing buttons on
or like really pushing the limit on like
sort of what hands you could play and
just being completely over aggressive
and back then like the field was just
very positive and people would
would really struggle to defend against
aggression so like uh
i think it just worked very well and
then i went through a period where i
actually won quite a bit
and like even on like a consistent basis
and then like uh what back then were
like sort of high stakes like these days
they would be considered
total mistakes but like or even low
stakes
but uh i did quite well
[Music]
but then then came a period when sort of
the the
the upswing ended
and i i gained such an enormous belief
in what i was doing and at the same time
you know people were catching up to what
i was doing
and
and that's really uh was like a sort of
a frustrating period for me because like
then all of a sudden like nothing worked
anymore and yeah i just tried to go more
extreme and extreme and whatever what i
was doing before
and
yeah so so that
that was like my first significant
downswing and i actually lost quite
quite a chunk of what i won back then
yeah
yeah so talk us through how you dealt
with that so it sounds like the big
score was a bit of a
almost like a rocket fuel moment where
it kind of build a due to higher stakes
it sounds like you did very well after
that and continued to build your role
playing very aggressively moving up
stakes and then some point down the line
you hit this downswing i'm guessing at
this moment your ego is quite inflated
your expectations are very high
photography how that downswing went in
terms of how it affected you and how you
get yourself out of that downswing
i mean like
it's hard for me to say now because
i wasn't so much aware of it back then
like there was there was no awareness of
like or nothing and upswing now i'm in a
downswing now
uh
um i mean there was an awareness in that
sense of results but not in the sense of
performance or like
i just felt like i was getting super
unlucky and
i had never encountered this this sort
of emotion before so i was
i was a bit more angry when playing i
was a little bit more easy till that i
would have like this
you know anger outburst of just shouting
behind your computer
or shouting at the screen so like um i
wouldn't say i got myself out of the
downswing
it's just that
you know i learned
to i experienced the bunch of times and
then i sort of found ways
that worked for me but but it wasn't
like a conscious decision like okay i
need to solve this it's just like i
even by chance i found a path which
would work for me and i was like i
really
spent a lot more time studying back then
like
like it really became like
part of my part of the game for me it
was like like just and like the study
would be totally incoherent and then
unorganized but like every day i would
be watching like my favorite players
seeing what they were doing or like
i would watch all the videos like all
the content that was available online i
would just consume consume consume all
of it
and like really put in like a large
volume of
yeah just
brute force brute hours
try to get better and uh
and
i think it was at that point that i i
think i stumbled across like a couple
phil galphon videos it was like when he
first started out playing or when he
first started making videos i think it
was for like
blue fire poker or something
like uh it's a really old site this is
like nine years ago or something
uh like um uh
and and he would talk about poker in
like this
sort of dual sentence he would all of a
sudden
he would not only talk about the theory
or like this is what i want to do with
this hand he would also talk about how
he would feel during that hunt and what
his sort of his biases were and like uh
you know what what he felt
uh like he needed to do to play that hat
well and that was that was like a really
[Music]
that sort of opened my eye and and from
that point on i became
a lot more calmer and a lot more
self-reflective in that sense that like
all right
you've just had a downswing but maybe
you know you just lost a bunch because
you were playing bad and you
you were you you didn't deserve it to
win anything anyway so like uh
that really you know slowed me down a
bit like slowed the testosterone down a
bit
and opened up like the sort of a
reflective channel myself
yeah i think that's also like it was
interesting that you said that the fir
the first adjustment was you had
something that worked and it wasn't
working we're like maybe i'm not
aggressive enough maybe i should even be
more aggressive because you know
aggression was what got you results so
your default response was okay
apparently i'm not aggressive enough
right
and then
like that that that you know that then
it's like i can imagine that if
your your tricks you know that you were
doing aren't working
then at some point you also describe the
anger right it's like yeah okay i don't
know what i'm doing so i'll just get
very angry or like what's going on and
it sounds like
by watching other players by by hearing
about what phil gavin had to say how he
thought about the game that you were
actually like
you actually could point at yourself
wait actually maybe i'm just playing but
did that give you maybe like a sense of
calmness and in terms of also get more
clarity and it's like oh wait this is
where i have to go i see a path forward
now so it's all good
yeah i mean i mean it was a huge relief
for me like it took me a long time to
sort of
incorporate it fully like uh it's it's
like
it's always with these like you have
these aha moments but then it takes like
a while to become part of your
personality or part of your process so
uh but that was like the first moment
that that really
opened up to me
and like
about going like over aggressive like
there's this hilarious video of me
i think it must be somewhere on youtube
still or like uh like this was all pre
twitch pre whatever like i recorded like
a session for for like a dutch poker
website
they asked me like hey uh you're one one
of the big players from the netherlands
now can you
you know talk a bit of can you record
your screen and talk a bit of strategy
like basically just twitch
before twitch was a thing
and i think it opens up with the hand
like four minutes into the video where
uh under the it's like first few levels
of like 100 rebuy or something and uh it
opens up with the hand where under the
gun opens
i decide to three about the six five off
in the small blind you gonna begun four
bets i'm all in for
90 days the guy calls kings and i'm like
yeah sometimes that just happens like
very often
like like you really have to push this
pre-flop aggression because like
otherwise people can just format
anything and then you'll be fine and
like that was sort of like a really
blase thing to say like you know i just
got in the six five off for 80 bigs and
it's all good like
like sometimes when i like to remind
myself i look look at that video
you can rebuy right so
i don't know it was it was not in the
revit period but like
it was somewhere somewhere early stages
and uh
that that's just an example of like
you know i would go completely overboard
with the pre-flop aggression and that
would work quite well until it stopped
working and then it started really
losing a huge amount
yeah you know if you if you if you up
your frequencies with sort of gto
approved hands you know it's not like
people are like
okay you know it's it's a little bit
loose but you know but if you if you see
the six five off you're like okay this
is
this guy's completely out of his mind
right
if you get x5 off then where do you draw
the line
yeah back then there was no concept of
one gta there were no lines there were
no boundaries like oh it's a five
student
you know yeah you've got the false proof
longer you're sort of happy
so it sounds like that first obstacle
that you encountered was a bit of a
catalyst for your studying and for going
deeper and working on yourself and then
also for watching the phil gal fund
stuff got you to be more inquisitive
about your maybe your biases and
overcoming your aggression so what point
did you realize that you were pushing
your aggression too far and how did you
start account of that how did you start
to ease off that aggression to find that
more balanced strategy for yourself
yeah i mean i i just became very curious
like there was like a period where i
just
you know i got on two plus two a bit i
started you know reading all the threads
of the high-stakes players back down
like high stakes players would still
happily discuss their strategy in public
and like all that
resources were just you know publicly
available
and people would just
give their insights on all the things
and then
you know i started posting a bit i
started writing a couple of these guys
like hey would you be interested to
to look at my stuff or to study together
i mean most of them said no
but uh
because they just thought i was this
weird fish that i was playing in
tournaments and stuff
and
but yeah eventually i found like a few
people to collaborate with
and
you know and that's when i really got
into the feedback loop of like
uh you know people would ask me like why
did you do that and i would explain my
reasoning
and i would sort of notice that i would
always try to be right
you know i would always try to give like
an explanation that
both justified my play and made me sound
very smart
and at one point i just realized like
wait a second i'm i'm not studying here
i'm just
i'm just defending my own ego or like my
own
idea of what i should be as a poker
player
and that's really when i i decided to
take a conscious step back on like all
right if somebody has input on a hand
especially somebody you respect like
just
listen to it
and uh and see what it brings you i'm
really in that sort of collaborative
sense i
i found out that like a lot of my
tendencies were based on
absolute nonsense and some of them were
actually very good ideas and
you know some some of the things i was
doing were actually
if i look back at them now i i look like
that was actually very smart
and uh
you were actually quite far ahead of
like what we would later find out to be
gto plays or to be
but yeah so i i found more more balance
than that i guess
yeah sometimes players especially new
school generations they think like how
did you guys play poker before solvers
right but
especially the better players
we were already doing a lot of stuff
that was very software approved right
and especially i think they're still
maybe even up until today there's still
players with old-school players that
like i don't need the solver
and but it's like the solver often
that does exactly what they would also
do and that's why they say like i don't
really need this solver
um because they were sort of already
playing solver approved strategies
somehow because they understood the game
right they understood how a hand
generates ev which basically what the
solver does very well
yeah i mean i mean and
i think this this discussion about
solvers and those solvers is like
sort of that that voice at this point
like
it's been discussed to the end of times
but
uh
you know like before before you had a
solo you basically ask yourself like
okay how do i make money in this hand
like what what is what is a good way to
play and i still think that's a very
relevant question and a question that
sort of
people forget to ask themselves every
once in a while
but then the solver is also
it's just a tool to to test
whenever you have this idea of like okay
what is a good way to play a hand and
you come up with an answer and then the
solver is just a really good way is like
all right
does this actually make sense or am i
forgetting something or
am i seeing something that's not there
or like is there some somewhere deeper
down the tree or like uh
you know the solar gives you a lot of
comprehension to the question you ask
yourself
especially also in terms of
the discussing hands like nowadays
people might even not
feel the need to discuss answers like
why i can just consult the dream machine
and he tells me exactly what is the case
but i think it's definitely very
valuable to discuss hands if you indeed
discuss it in a way that you're actually
open to learn because i think a lot of
people like the story that you just told
i can definitely relate to in the
beginning like
you're not you're not discussing a hand
to find the truth you're just discussing
a hand in order to prove that you're
right and if two
players are discussing hands and trying
to prove to the other that they're right
you will get a very interesting
conversation that no one will actually
learn from right and i think at some
point in their in in everyone's play
poker playing careers
you will have that confrontation with
the ego
that's like wait
what's going on here you know you get
into a heated argument trying to defend
your place
until at some point you just realize
[ __ ] i'm not making any progress this
way
so
when you realize that
how did your discussions change
in in the future about hands like and
how did you know it had
a big like positive impact i imagine on
your career to get back at that sort of
type of discussion is very logical in
some sense right it's like you know if
you are a poker player you are sort of
this egomaniac where you're like all
right i'm the best at the table i'm
going to sit here win all your guys's
money and i'm going to crush you and
you sort of get this very
singular egoistic person that thinks
he's better than everyone else so then
like if that's the sort of mentality
that it takes to be a good poker player
the the person to be a good discussion
partner or like a good study partner is
like the complete opposite right he's
like
he's curious he's humble he's like
asking questions he's trying to figure
out stuff so like you need to to have to
combine these two personalities into one
to be to be really successful at both
areas
and that's not an easy ask for most
people and
so so it's not strange for me that
that these sort of discussions happen
very often where like two guys are just
discussing a hand and not coming to any
sort of conclusion
and
you know like i just found the right
people to be honest like uh at one point
i just clicked with a few people
and um
uh i mean there was one point that was
very very important to me it's like um
after posting a bid on two plus two
a guy approached me
uh he was like a australian super high
stakes player
and he approached me and he was like
are you interested in getting staked
and you know i wasn't doing too great at
the time i didn't have much
role in life twice
i was still comfortable i never really
got to the point where i was like
completely down in the dumps but i
i was i was sort of hitting a lower
point at least confidence-wise
and
he asked me if uh
if i wanted to get staked
and like he was this really smart guy
like he knew so much more about poker
than everybody else did at that point
and like i got staked by him and got
added into this group
and he would have like these regular
sessions of like
uh
you know when
all of a sudden there was a little bit
of accountability
and also i was i was in a group with
like really great players so so there
was i mean there was no room for me to
be arrogant because there was nothing to
be arrogant about you know like i was
all of a sudden i was studying with
these guys that you know that won the
pca and won like a million dollars
online and like
they were playing a hundred two hundred
feel low and like all these all these
crazy games like uh
and i was just you know i was just some
guy
and
and then there was like
[Music]
i mean there's a couple ways to go about
that for sure but i just felt so
grateful i just felt so happy to be
in that environment and to to have these
connections and
i learned such an incredible amount from
them
that's still something that like okay so
you entered this group i assume you
gained a lot of knowledge
uh you were in general very curious
about the game right so you're very open
to that knowledge and as your career
went into quite a you know you you got
out of out of the struggles i think
confidence wise it also helps right if
you get a strategy with a lot of very
good players you kind of take a little
bit of their confidence with you because
you know they're so good and you're
you're learning strategies from them so
it helps your confidence in a way
like if you go to a downswing nowadays
do you
do you steal them
go to back to that group or do you still
go back to other people discuss hands
like how how how do you now handle a
downswing compared to them like what do
you look for
i mean i mean i'm much more conscious of
what a downswing is right now than i was
by the time like back then i i
considered the downswing just bad luck
in your cards basically it's like all
right we're losing money we're in a
downswing now we're winning money when
absolutely no i now much more recognize
that it's like
a whole process that comes along with
that like the fact that you're losing
money also hits on your confidence which
is this on your ability to perform which
hits on your ability to execute
so like uh
i i i now maintain like a much more
balanced routine to make sure that i
uh that whenever i'm losing
that i
know to pay extra attention to these
kind of things that i you know that
whenever i'm i feel like i'm i'm not
playing my best or like in an unlucky
streak so to speak
you know to start playing a little bit
of less tables and to make sure to focus
on quality
to focus on uh improving your iri and
instead of the volume so
because because like
uh
you know if your roi goes up volume goes
down like the downswings become much
less significant of course
so uh
yeah i mean these days i i have like a
lot of things besides
talking to players or trying to improve
my game that that helped me and also my
my study routine i mean
it doesn't really matter if i'm in a
downswing or not i just have a routine
that i stick to study wise
so like um
yeah i
i mean
these days i don't really feel like
there's ever really a downswing or an
upswing
it's just it's just like one big session
like you just play like a cc where it
leads
but yeah like like still still
discussing strategy with good players
and sort of
you know like like once you once you
find out a couple things like all right
this is where
uh i'm gonna be so much better this is
like an area where i'm really gonna
win money against against the opponents
i'm playing that's that that that's
that's always a great way of course
but that's not something you should do
only when an announcement
so that's and that's the thing right i
guess earlier on in your career
you
do things you're more reactive
it sounds like you were more reactive
earlier on in your career and now you
just
you know you set like ups and downs it
doesn't really matter i just see it as a
long-term session i think also at some
point you know when you go with the ups
and downs of poker it can be very
stressful right uh i guess at some point
it's also like you have to find a way to
start handling that stress you have to
change your perspective on the ups and
down swings and it sounds like you've
you've really found it like it doesn't
throw you off anymore it's like
would you say that an upswing doesn't
anymore make you feel like you're the
best pokemon player in the world and the
downswing doesn't anymore make you feel
like the worst poker in the world
is that like the swings just got way way
less it doesn't influence you
i mean in an ideal world yes like but uh
i'm still human like i still care about
upswings and down swings like it's not
like i'm immune for it it's just like
the extremes are sort of less uh the
polarity of it is
it's less big i guess
but like uh i mean
it still hurts losing a bunch of money
of course and it still feels great
winning a bunch of money and you still i
mean it's very hard to get out
especially in tournaments because the
swings are so intense like it's very
hard to get out of your own head and say
like all right i just won like such a
huge amount but i'm not the best player
in the world i'm just the same guy that
was before like or like once you get
crushed for like a streak and like you
just feel like you're making the wrong
play every single time and like
everybody seems to
you know you get this voice in your head
like are they recording my screen or
what's going on
it impacts you i mean i think i think
anybody says anybody that says that they
that has no impact on them at all
especially in tournaments i i think is
lying it has to be
it's either lying or they're unaware of
their own
in our workings we like it
but yeah but but like uh there was a
moment where
um i think like two two and a half years
ago
or like maybe three and a half years ago
where i really made like
a big jump in stakes where i really
started playing like the 10ks online
where i i bought into like a couple
really big buy and life events
and
uh i could sort of notice
immediately like my old patterns coming
back like i was just in such a new field
and
like the amounts were still extreme all
of a sudden
it's sort of like this this whole
swing of confidence of like all right
i'm the best i'm the worst
it came back like
in
a while
but it came back by when when i really
started to enter like the super high
stakes
so uh i mean that was definitely an
interesting experience
would be one of these
you know you said you fall into old
habits right how does that translate
into in terms of what you do but also in
terms of i'm very curious basically as
well what would you say is like a
typical
c game habit for you do you reverse back
to that aggression that you mentioned
very early on in your career do you go
hyper hyper aggressive or
yeah that's that's one result of it
like sort of uh the big one is
entitlement i guess i just feel like um
i'm supposed to win every hand or like
uh
i just feel like i'm supposed to get a
result in sort of every tournament that
i'm that i play in
and that makes me
you know sort of push the yeah
like
sort of push push the buttons too much
or like um
uh you know what i try to force the
issue
and then that all stems from entitlement
i think like um
just this idea that
if you think that you are much better
than you are in reality
is you also get this expectation of
having to win much more than you shoot
in reality
and at that point you're just
i just get i just sometimes get into
this mode where i think like all right i
have to do lots of special things
in order to in order to perform well or
in order to
to show that i'm much better
where whereas like
i mean a lot of empty people at least
uh especially at the higher stakes these
days it's just like
playing a little bit defensive you know
making sure that you're the one not
making the mistakes
and like uh it requires like a lot of
patience and
some humility in some sense
um like when i'm playing my c game or
yeah
especially sea game all over i guess
it's like uh that entitlement ramps up
like sort of the the patience and the
and the humility goes right there
yeah so when you notice these patterns
coming back when you started playing
high stakes again a few years ago how
you deal with them so you had
entitlement coming in you had a bit more
aggressive tendencies how do you
overcome those wells there's high stakes
poker on the line and there's lots of
money involved how did you where you
wait for those problems
i mean like uh it's it's still something
i struggle with like every now and then
so there's no there's not like one magic
bullet where i would say like all right
do this and you will never have
entitlement again i think like the
awareness is a really big part of it
i think just you know
having the capacity to be honest with
yourself
and to really sit down and like all
right why did i make this decision why
did i do the thing that i did and really
you know
don't don't take the easy answer or
something you know don't don't tell
yourself i made a mistake you know
really find out why you made the mistake
and
you know to read it it's a it's quite a
time consuming process as well
and it just takes a lot of awareness of
your own
mental patterns
and um i mean i also think it's it's
great to get
help in that sense to have some sort of
accountability it's like uh
if you if you
explain to somebody i made a mistake
there and somebody asks you why
and then you explain why and then he's
like all right but this is that all you
know like is that really the reason or
is there like
some sort of underlying pattern here or
like is this something that comes up
more and more often or when does it come
off or why does it come up you know does
it come up when you're tired
does it come up when you're playing
higher stakes and why does it come up
why does it only come up when you're
playing higher expected you sort of have
this
[Music]
person question your beliefs
yeah
feel feels important
yeah
yeah i think that's a very underlooked
part of poker and progression when you
have to look internally gain
self-awareness into your belief systems
your biases a lot of times we're just
blind excited to those things and we
don't want to look it sounds like for
yourself like a common theme coming
through this interview is that you've
always asked the people for their
opinions you've always been curious to
uh no more answers which first took you
into your own study habits and it sounds
like you'll put a career you've
surrounded yourself with good people
good mentors and good advice to begin so
is there any mentors in particular or
any coaches or players who've had a big
impact on the way you think about poker
or being particularly helpful to you
throughout your career
yeah so so the the guy that i mentioned
he was
he's called jay kinkett he was like a
big high-stakes plo player from
australia he used to be he was my backer
for a couple years
and like he he was this really really
smart guy
and like he was he was sort of
transitioning out from poker
uh he was doing like a masters in
psychology or something so he also had
like a lot of good insight into the to
the the workings of the mind and he
would he would just you know uh he would
really
hold me accountable you know i would do
something incredibly stupid and normally
i would just brush it over like i was
just unlucky you're like maybe he would
just really nail me down like uh be
restricting me with some sense like
just white after you do that like like
what what happens in your brain that you
that you come to this decision and like
uh
and he also did this to other people and
and sort of seeing what sort of mistakes
other people made that i didn't it was
very useful for me to know like uh
so yeah
he was a big part of it and then like uh
uh
you know like like uh i mean the renee
was like
uh when when i started joining like the
the strategy
uh courses or like the strategy
discussions with flores
like that that just opened up a whole
world to me and in the sense of the
the mechanical workings of the brain as
well it's like uh
there is
you know there's there's not only
a mental sense of awareness there's also
a very real
biological element to what you're doing
the like
you know the excitement
you get during a tournament it means
something and it means something for
like the hormones you produce and like
the way
your brain connects everything and the
way your brain operates and that was a
big eye opener for me as well
yeah yeah would you say your
self-awareness is one of your good skill
sets that gives you an edge on the
competition your ability to seek for
answers but also to reflecting yourself
yeah yeah i i think i would like like
just the the general curiosity like
i think it's like a combination of
curiosity like the fact that i've always
enjoyed playing poker a lot it was like
a very valuable thing
um and that in combination with being
very reflective being being able to
reflect on myself
and
also like
uh
that that sort of like the last few
years is something i've really thought
about a lot is like you know you used to
have fuel players you used to have
players that that that would not play
solvers like back then when it was still
discussion versus solvers versus field
players and like um
there's like
a lot of information entering the
subconsciousness
which can actually be very valuable even
even from like a poker game
and like um and
uh like that comes with like sort of big
awareness
and you know the when when a hand
happens and you sort of have these
spidey senses you you sort of know
something's going on like
uh like i really started testing like
which one of these is a bias which one
of these is just something that i want
to happen but then which one of these is
actually you know an instinct that
gives valuable information just it can
be the smallest things you know like
maybe there's something about the timing
about something about
the sizing something about the
the
the flow of like the game flow like why
did he choose this exact moment to do
this like there's
there's something that's very hard to
quantify
but at the same time it gives a lot of
information and actually that voice is
pretty
if you have a good voice like if you
have a good intuition for these kind of
things it makes sense to start listening
to that a bit but at the same time you
have to be very careful with it because
like the the boundary between that sort
of information and just creating like a
huge bias for yourself
yeah so i think yeah
you you almost say that nowadays
maybe maybe you went through phases in
your poker where you would just shut the
voice down or listen much to the voice
and it sounds like you found kind of the
sweet spot and keeping the door a little
bit open listening to what he has to say
and kind of filtering out the noise
between what is actual valuable
information right it's probably also
something that you feel like it's a gut
feeling
yeah i mean i think that's like the
biggest difference between like
when i play at my
top level or when i sort of drop down
from there it's like if i'm really sharp
and if i'm really into it i always go
from observation to conclusion so like
there's always
a few things i see i get a few bits of
information i try to collect that into a
coherent strategy and then i act on it
if i'm playing worse like you sort of
get like all right i want to call the
river and then you go like all right i
have good blockers you can you can have
many gloves you know you you sort of
start with the conclusion and then you
start figuring dreaming out reasons for
why you should take a specific action
and like uh and and
yeah so it works the same with that sort
of intuitive voice
it's like i've seen
probably at this point millions of
online poker hands you know like there's
something about the timing for example
that people can bet the written like
that's very hard for me to quantify like
i could i could try to analyze like a
hundred thousand river bets and see what
time the timing they used but i haven't
done any of that
it would be interesting actually but
like uh um
but there's something about
like you've made so many observations
that's sort of the subconscious level
like all right this feels strong it's
it's sort of it's it's an important
piece of information it's not like
you could should completely act on it
but it gives you like some sort of
it's based on something and it's based
on like
a very large amount of observations
that can be quite interesting actually
that's really interesting yeah you said
like when you're at your best you go
quite quickly from observation to a
conclusion as a decision but when you're
not at your best you're off new way
around will come with a conclusion like
you want to call or be in a spot and
then you'll try to think the reasoning
after so yeah it feels like yourself you
would define yourself as an intuitive
player is that right
um and
not really like it's it's not my
um
like i i would consider myself
i mean i i i'd be hard to to box in i
guess but like i consider it like a
valuable piece of information yeah and
the stronger the intuitive feeling is
the the the more i'm willing to deviate
from like my baseline strategy
but but i do i do develop like very
clear specific strategies for all my
situations and
and you know it all depends on how close
of a decision it is and how
like how
how
how highly i rate the intuitive feeling
yeah and like for example like in life
poker as well like
your intuitive feelings can just be a
lot stronger because because you you get
so much more information you get so much
more input
so like
yeah i mean i wouldn't say i'm an
intuitive player because i always try
like even if i have a strong intuition
about something i always try to finish
like the logical process behind it
but i do value the information
yeah you don't close yourself up to what
your intuition
tries to tell you right it's not like oh
there's a feeling let's just block it
like again the word curiosity comes back
right you're curious to what your gut
feeling tries to tell you
yeah but but i'm also very uh
i test these a lot like like when i'm
playing and
like
for example like i see a certain bed
size on the flop and i like intuitively
i feel something i feel like alright
this feels weaker than average or
stronger than average i then try to go
back write that down and you know see
see if that calibration of my intuitive
feeling is actually correct or if it's
just a bias of something that i want to
see
you know like uh so so it's it's not
like i just leave
the intuition there to to just do its
thing it's something i really try to
work with and i really try to calibrate
yeah so intuition seems like a good
power
but it's like it can also sometimes be
playing with fire you really have to
start to become good at
trusting it and it also sounds like the
work you did with with with the guy from
australia that you mentioned right to
really
go deep into basically the mental
mistakes like where did i go flawed in
my uh in my logic where was it a bias
you start to identify more like what's
real information and what's sort of the
bias and
you start to differentiate feelings okay
i wanna just do that now out of
entitlement for example something that
you mentioned or out of a real piece of
information because like you said i
played one million poker hands right
it's a process that
you start to recognize you you start to
call [ __ ] on your feelings basically
right yeah yeah and i actually think
these things are really interesting to
test to just play like a session and
like uh
to write down like all right
i i have a feeling that whenever people
uh
i don't know like like say say one of
your intuitive feelings is like
uh all right the guy bets big on the
river
he has it more often than not it's like
you can just go back to your data and
check if that's actually true
and like uh and to sort of test
these these these programs that you
learn yourself to test if
if if they are true and especially like
i find it especially a nice opportunity
when you have a hand
that actually like
that doesn't lose any ev when you're
wrong so for example like you get four
back in a certain scenario and you
intuitively say like all right this is
the type of guy that never bluffs
like this is just the guy that never
loves in this scenario like that's
that's an intuition that's like a
feeling that can't come up like he's
really really strong like some guys will
forgot bluff but this guy is just not
one of them is you you like you test
that sort of moment yeah like instead of
just automatically going all in with
your asus you you go and ask yourself
all right
uh
is this a guy who i expect to just never
fall to just have a bluff here like once
in a blue moon like once in 80 times or
once and 70 times and then if you fight
by jam and the guy folds you go like all
right
maybe that sort of intuitive feeling was
not completely correct
like uh you can sort of
and and you're making a lot of money
anyway because you're five by jamming
aces into a tight player yeah but
there's also like an opportunity for
learning and and yeah so that's that's
like an amazing place to be
it's it sounds like you're in the
process
of
making the unconscious right unconscious
piece of information which you labeled
also as your intuition
you take that intuition and try to make
it conscious like interesting i feel
like this spot is strong what is it
about the texture uh maybe the stage in
the tournament maybe the stack sizes and
then you i think it's very valuable then
if you can make that information
conscious then next time when you play
your b or c game what you said that
sometimes that intuition may be less
sharp and if you made your intuition
conscious you can implement it in your
bnc game as well so basically you're
progressing as a player
yeah yeah for sure and and it's it's
also it's also just a lot of fun
actually like it is a lot of fun right
because sometimes you also just call
[ __ ] like oh apparently i was wrong
yeah it's like like an extra element to
your game is like a piece of
self-exploration like how do i work how
does my brain work and like um yeah i i
just think it's like an enjoyable
element to add sometimes
this thing is also the difference
between you we talked about you know and
it's been talked many times about how to
use solvers but i think the better
players okay there's going to be some i
was now going to say like you and me was
maybe a little bit narcissistic but you
know when we look probably at the solver
you immediately it does something and
you feel a feeling like nah this is not
right and then you kind of go through
the tree and you say yeah okay i
understand what you're doing because
this is gonna happen but this doesn't
happen in practice then obviously you
can go out test if that's literally the
case but i think a lot of strong players
they have that
intuit intuition when they look at the
solver and it
makes it easier for them to kind of
touch the the classic solver errors
basically yeah
i mean
i mean like there's there's also this
this group of guys who are just really
really proficient at following the
solvers and just they they just they
just have really really solid
fundamentals and like
uh they're very unlikely to to make a
mistake and they sort of follow the play
of the solver like very closely and
these are just very good players like
i i wouldn't say
that there's one group that's actually
better than the other uh
there's always a mix of course
but the one thing i would say about
tournaments is that like
everything is like so dynamic
everything is so like there's so
many situations you can get into
there's so many variables like like the
the stage of the tournaments the payouts
like the exact stack size configuration
because like you know like you can and
all the different stack sizes you can
learn all the trees from 100 bb from a
50 bb from a 40 bb but then you have a
situation where the button opens and the
small light has 20 bigs and the big
light has 40 bigs you know you have all
these differences and they all matter
they all matter like a huge amount
because you know like a solver is very
sensitive to sort of the pre-flop ranges
that you give it so like once you start
tweaking a little bit there like the
output becomes completely different so i
feel like in tournaments you need to
have some sort of this
improvisation like you can't
you can't just learn all the baseline
strategies and try to play them
perfectly because
it's just too too too big of a
computational cloud like there's there's
just too much going on to do that
leading up to the podcast i was
listening back to a couple of other
podcasts for inspiration and some
guidelines and i listened to a podcast i
don't anymore know which one it was but
it was with kevin rabbit
kevin that heads-up guy from run at once
kevin rabichevac
rabbit chow sorry for butchering your
name uh but he was like he was he's a
cash game heads-up player and then he
transitioned to tournaments and he was
talking about the struggles that he had
in terms of the way he used to learn the
game
heads up cash
is you know you can go really deep into
small nuances in spots because there
aren't as many spots whereas in
tournaments as you said there's just so
much variables that keep on changing
that if he would take that study
approach
and use it in tournaments it would take
him his whole life to figure out how
tournaments work right so
you need a bit more of a holistic
approach and kind of get a feel for how
various situations play right and that's
kind of also i think what you're
describing
yeah yeah for sure i like uh
i mean you you also see this i think
quite often like the cash games
transitioning to the entities is that
that's like a really an area they
struggle with it's like like uh
you know like
situations that are quite easy to solve
uh all of a sudden become very difficult
for them because they just have no
reference or no no guidelines for them
and and they don't have like this
natural improvisation they don't have
like this natural
way of figuring out
and um
so yeah i mean i i i still think that
the systematic solar study is very very
important and it's very very useful
but to be in the illusion of just being
able to execute all of those strategies
uh
whenever you need them to be like all
right i'll just open up a file like
hijacked versus cut off 30bp
like near the bubble i just know what to
do i i i mean i just don't think it's
realistic
but maybe
maybe i mean you always have to assume
that
that you're competing with very smart
guys like maybe there's like a couple of
guys who have like i don't know this
really sick chess players memory that
they can just navigate this and that
they can
contain all this information within the
heads i just found out for me that like
it was not
it was not a very realistic thing to do
i mean the way we approach poker i mean
obviously we have discussed poker many
of ours and
you know we're both big fan uh
to to
yeah to find the mechanics right to to
stay within the line of the name of the
podcast try to find the mechanics and
the differences how certain spots work
and kind of from there
use your intuition now this is a spot
where usually this applies and then kind
of see what the small variables are and
try to figure it out and i guess it's
also
the more more variables are the more you
should try to let go of making the
perfect decision i think that's probably
something that they then struggle with
as well just dealing with the fact that
you cannot make perfect decisions
because of so many variables i would say
that there's a spot that i would
struggle with as a cash game player
going to amputees
yeah and i mean i also think like uh
um whenever people play some sort of
strategy that's very close to a software
they expect to make a lot of money
and then when people start making
mistakes
they expect to be making a lot more
even a lot more money
and like um
that's not necessarily true especially
in tournaments where like
uh
you know like you could be doing
something very silver approved in an icm
scenario for example
uh and still lose a ton of money just
because of the response of your of your
opponent so you really need to be aware
of like what sort of factors influence
your decisions there
so given the way the game plays it's
just being quote quote gto punishes you
a little bit more than in cash game
because of for example icm
considerations yeah i mean i mean a good
example of that i always find is like if
you're playing a satellite
and i don't know there's five people
left
and four people gotta take it like
satellite is sort of the most extreme
icm scenario you can get into
um it's like
uh if you're a second in ships and the
big blind is a cheap leader and he's
like a huge will and he's gonna make
super loose calls and
uh you know he's just
not gonna respect the fact that he
doesn't need to win the tournament but
he can only win a ticket
that's actually bad for your ev if you
are out of position against this player
so he's going to make a lot of mistakes
against you
yet it hurts your your expected win rate
in this tournament
and that's that's in a lot of tournament
scenarios where like
uh
you know like the people who are not in
the han they can they have an
opportunity to make money so like
whenever there's two people entering the
hand and one one person makes a mistake
which ends up
to both players busting more often for
example
but like that's not good for the player
like he's making a mistake against
somebody but the player he's making the
mistake against is not the player making
the money but there's actually other
people on the table so like uh
you know if you then go to this like
silver mindset like all right whatever
i'm doing in the solar is good
yeah you're just you're just not seeing
the whole puzzle
that's i think very interesting i
remember once you told me about a hand i
think it was in
in a seminar that we gave where you
actually
folded the hand that's normally being
played
so you basically you follow the hand to
get out of the way because you figured
the players behind you would make bigger
mistakes if you would go out of the way
than if you would play the hand
basically i thought that was for me that
was mind-blowing like what do you mean
we have a great hand i just look at my
hands can i play my hand but you
literally you threw your cards away the
guy made a mistake right re-jamming i
think a way to lose of a hand and you
make money by doing nothing
yeah i think i think it was in one of
the seminars we did but like basically
inducing
uh situations in which people bust very
frequently
especially if you have people that
that are likely to bust too often or
like that they're likely to take too big
of a risk it's a great strategy to make
money into them this is like uh you know
just go out of the way like the the way
in cash games uh it always works is like
uh you know you play a hand
it's minus cv you don't play a hand and
if it's plus ed you play a half
yeah
in tournaments you you you sort of have
to outperform pv of a fault
so like a marginal plus if you had
becomes minus ep because the threshold
of what you're trying to outperform
becomes higher
very difficult in the same time you
notice that because
to go back to a point you were talking
about right you you were starting to
play more high rollers and you talked
about the people when we talked a little
bit about gto you said some people are a
bit more defensive by nature and from
there they might you know they first try
to defend well and from there they might
start exploiting you you encountered
and maybe we can talk about this like
getting out of the way for other people
to make a mistake you encounter these
plays i assume more when you started to
play these higher stakes tournaments
yeah i mean i mean like the thing with
higher stakes tournaments is just like
you have this very
uh
uncomfortable combination of like people
will just make less mistakes so you get
less of this confirmation of like oh
yeah i played a really good hunter like
i played this really well you just get
paid less in general with your good
hands that kind of thing
and then whenever you make a mistake
like they
they have the ability to pounce them to
really punish it
um
and that's only of the mistakes you're
aware of like then there's also this
part where you also have to consider is
like
these people know something that i don't
or it's possible that these people know
something that i don't so i really have
to watch out for that but uh but yeah
that's that's the the biggest thing
about playing higher stakes is like
people are just going to make mistakes
less
so uh
so your own mistakes are going to be
much more costly
and that's why a lot of people sort of
employ a little bit of a more of a
defensive strategy i guess
is because uh because not making a
mistake this becomes so so much more
important yeah because also yeah
attacking and going out there and trying
to pick up chips
you will blunder probably way more
frequently than you would do at mid
stakes for example
an exploit a positive a positively
uh inten a positive intention to make an
exploit can blow up in your face a bit
more often at higher stakes
yeah yeah for sure and there's also less
opportunity to compensate for mistakes
you know like uh
you know say you you open a little bit
too wide you could consider that a
mistake but at mid stage you could
uh you know value that a little bit more
correctly you can
attack less you
you sort of have a higher realization of
your hand so like the mistake just
becomes smaller and like at higher stake
it just it just means like if the
mistake is getting completely punished
even a very marginal mistake or a very
small detail can end up losing
uh quite a bit in the long run so like
and also the defensive strategy is i
guess a bit easier to play
[Music]
what would you say was
was the biggest adjustment you had to
make when you played when you started
play like you know you were even
referring to very high buy-ins live uh
what were kind of adjustments that you
had to make when you started playing
higher and were there also some
adjustment in terms of high stakes live
and online was there a difference um
no i mean like
the fields look pretty similar in those
i guess like like online is it's it's
like online you get a little bit less of
like the
the huge high-stakes whales i guess
like uh they just show up for like these
really high buy-ins less often
but yeah like uh i mean one one of the
big mistakes was was that or like one of
the big adjustments that i was that i
made was like i couldn't just assume
you know people would make mistakes in
certain spots like i i sort of had like
a lot of
like a big subset of tricks of things
that i knew worked and you know uh sort
of situations where i could up the
aggression a little bit situations where
it made sense to
downplay the aggression a bit
um
and
what i've straight away noticed in the
higher stakes was that um people started
exploiting that
and that people would put me into
situations which i hadn't encountered
which i didn't really consider
you know i would you know start checking
back hands on on specific boards
um and i would all of a sudden face
sizings that i that i that i didn't form
that i didn't have like a coherent
strategy against
and um
so yeah that was that was definitely a
big adjustment so you sort of have to be
wildly prepared for anything that
happens
it sounds i get a deja vu from earlier
in your career right where basically
also you had a set of tricks which was
to be very aggressive now you had a set
of tricks which worked versus the
population but then again you were now
suddenly playing high rollers which i
guess is a different population on its
own right a lot of the players that form
a population
weren't playing these tournaments so you
kind of
had to start over again but in the same
time last time you learned a lot from it
as well what were the things that you
then learned from
you know take taking these shots at
these highest stakes right you you
already mentioned you were very
competitive and you're in generally
curious so what is the thing that you
learned the most
yeah i mean i mean like uh
it sort of entered like a chain of
events for me it was like
uh
i played it i played some of the higher
stakes tournaments and then it had such
like uh the fact that i wasn't
performing as well as i thought i could
uh combined with the fact that it was
having like a lot bigger mental impact
on me than i than i expected it to have
um yeah it really sort of
started like a
chain of events where
like even i had to quit playing poker
for a while just because i had a burnout
and i was
it was affecting me so much
so like the thing that i learned from it
was like
that that i don't necessarily need to
play them like
for me it's like sort of an open
question at this point
where like uh uh
you know i i would like to complete
compete but it's no longer
a necessity and like uh when i feel like
i'm in a good place to compete
i i will
but if if that place if i never reach
that place i'm also at peace with that
like like
it just got to the sense where like
the competition felt so fierce
and the pressure felt so high
that uh that i wasn't really sure if
that's what i wanted
so actually because you mentioned before
as well right the competitiveness it was
like yeah i have to i think you
mentioned that like you felt like you
had to you had to prove yourself there
right you had to prove you had to play
high stakes you you know because you're
your advice that's what you do you're a
high-stakes poker player
so
would you say that that experience
learned you to
reflect a bit more in terms of okay why
do i actually have to play high six
poker do i have to play high six poker
is that is that what i wanted in line
with my goals
yeah i mean i mean again it was it was
never really like a money thing
the high stakes it was it was not like
all right i've made this much money now
i got to play higher to make even more
money like that was never really one of
the considerations
like it really became came from a
competitive element
but it also it sort of led me down to a
tunnel where like i was feeling like i
was playing so high that i had to
perform so well that was loading up so
much pressure on myself
and like i just went to my old patterns
where like uh all right
i want to get better i'll just you know
brute force hours hours hours i'll just
put in all the time
and like i was just becoming uh you know
i was reaching a level of like
unsustainability
where like the the amount of effort and
time i was putting into it was like no
longer
sustainable health-wise
and
[Music]
i mean
that's something i'm still recovering
from but it's something that took me a
really long time to recover from
and that's also opened me up to the fact
that like
you know there's no
the end game here is not to be
michael adamo like like that's that's
that's obviously a amp game like that
that would be a very nice end game to be
and if if you manage to read that reach
that point
but it's not the only end game that's
not the only it's not the only place to
be
that's that that's very interesting so
basically
you used to think that yeah like okay uh
i have to become sort of the best i have
to compete with the best and basically
what you're saying now you
given how what you experienced you found
a new
definition of success for you you could
almost say like
the popular definition of success is the
players
are successful who battle the highest
stakes tournaments right and as long as
you don't reflect on that question what
a success for you you just follow
the society norm in this case you know
who plays the highest so
that changed for you i would say yeah
yeah for sure and like uh
there's also this sense where uh
you know you're always feeling like you
have to be the best it's not a very
healthy mindset to be in because it's a
very fragile place to be like the who is
the best is like a very
very small and very heavily debated sort
of group
and there's also this sensor like i i
sort of understood that maybe it just
wasn't for me
like like maybe
you know like maybe
the the guys that really do well that
super high stakes these days
they might have
a skill set which i do not possess or
like which i am no longer comfortable
developing
like this really this sense of like
um all right uh i'm gonna sit here play
for huge amounts and i'm not gonna let
it affect anything i'm gonna you know
like the the sort of the tenacity and
the discipline that like if you watch
one of those 300k like all these guys
they are
taking 30 seconds exactly 30 seconds for
every decision like
they
give away nothing tells why it's like
they have like this
complete uh
armor of
physical presence
like um
maybe
maybe that's just not for me
and to sort of accept that that's okay
like uh
um and
and to accept that i i no longer want to
invest like
90 of my spare time into into developing
myself as a poker player
this is interesting so there's like two
two points here there's one
maybe they possess certain
skills or have certain talent that maybe
i don't have
and second let's say
there are things that i can do in order
to join them on that table timing 30
seconds forever for every decision
then the question now is do i actually
want that like do i have to put in
such an amount of effort do i have to
make so much sacrifice in order to get
there as well is it actually something
that would still be considered a win for
me if i would do that right then you
might end up at the table but you would
feel miserable because of all the
sacrifices you had to make
yeah because because because after after
that period of playing like really high
stakes
and and i i i literally crashed i sort
of i had a burnout and i had a period
where i just couldn't play poker for
months
where i
like
i just
i mean i had a very significant burnout
in that sense where like i was just
physically incapable of doing a lot of
the things that were
completely normal to me before
so like there was also the the very
realistic question is like is this even
something
i can't do you know like a i don't know
like a professional football player that
uh
has weak knees or something
you know his career at 25 becomes like
that sort of this point but like all
right he's had a few injuries it doesn't
make sense to continue
um so there's that element to it and
then there's also the element of like
uh
do i want it like like does it bring me
happiness like what is sort of the end
goal here
like i always assumed the end goal would
be to just
uh
just just be the best
but yeah you have to be very realistic
with yourselves it's unlikely that
you're the best
yeah especially if you're competitive
right that's just if you don't stop to
think about what you want that's kind of
what you go for i mean this is the game
you put all your hours in so why not try
to become the best yeah and then it's
it's like uh
it's it's sort of a trap i feel like a
lot of poker players fall into it like
everybody is just so focused on becoming
the best
that nobody really accepts the fact that
it's very unlikely that they'll be even
close to the best
and like uh
and that's sort of
the end game for them and for most
players it looks
vastly different than the guys who are
trying to make like the actual high
stakes
so uh yeah that was that was a very
interesting experience for me
what were it it was almost like
you you said that you also got physical
responses so it was like your body at
some point he gave basically you had
some time to make up your mind but
you didn't make up your mind and at some
point your body just said hey listen man
if you don't make up your mind then i'll
make it very clear for you we're not
gonna do this yeah so i made up my mind
in the sense that that it was something
that i wanted to try that i wanted to
try to achieve
and then the body just said no you just
said a big no like uh just pull the
brakes and the footwork is really hard
like uh i remember that period where
like uh
you know if i look back on it now there
was like a couple red flags and a couple
of warning signs
but yeah i was very curious like what
are the signs that that i mean i mean
the warning signs are are
quite different for everybody i guess
but
uh you know if you have this feeling
that you just need one big score to get
to the success that you require
like that's that's sort of a big warning
sign was like all right you're you're
sort of
uh hopefully projecting like almost with
like a gambler's attitude like all right
if i just make this one bank then like
all of it will be okay
um i mean if you're just physically
neglecting yourself which often happens
right a lot of time into poker you feel
like oh i need to study more play more
yeah if you notice the quality of your
sleep going down that's like a huge
huge warning sign if like
if you are taking a shower or walking in
the park and like it's just
hand histories like
flashing through your mind like
constantly
uh like that then there's a point where
you're just you're not thinking about
the poker strategically but it's just
uh it occupies so much of your brain
that it just can't do anything else but
sort of uh repeat those images
like you then want like a big score what
what then is it about that big score
what is the big score going to give you
yeah usually people think of like all
right
then i'll have the bankroll to be
completely comfortable and to be
completely happy in those games
but it's it's all a pipe dream of course
because there's always a higher game to
play and there's always a bigger
bigger tournament to play so like
there's always more action to get
so like
this mentality of having a big score
like often people relate sort of their
struggles to their current situation
so like all right
i struggle with a couple of things
but money would fix these struggles
quite often like
you know like i stress about money a lot
right
you know i haven't been able to invest
enough in bitcoin as much as i wanted to
and if i could have just done that if i
just had a big score then it would have
been much more now and
completely financially secure and like
it would
be any problem like
people sort of uh deflect the personal
responsibility that they have
to like external factors and like
you know a big score
is is an external factor that helps you
in a lot of ways very often but if
you're going to be dependent on that
that's just
you know then then you're just not in a
good zone to perform
and then you just get very close to what
actually looks like
[Music]
you know what a psychologist or a
psychiatrist would define as a gambling
for yourself when you hit this burnout
point what was the first things you
start to do to
start to recharge or rebuild yourself
what was the avenues you you went down
i mean like uh
it was a very interesting period for me
but like to be honest
the the first few
like i hit the burnout and the burnout
looked like just constant panic attacks
just like having very poor sleep just
you know
being completely out of any sort of
physical comfort
and
and to be honest like if i look back on
up here that i think for the first few
days i i went a bit mad honestly like
it's a it's a very strange thing to
realize about you but i i i genuinely
think i went a bit mark
i i was just
in my house in like
constant panic mode unable to sleep but
being super tired at the same time you
know going from panic to panic and like
uh
[Music]
i i didn't have any tools to to deal
with this i never had a panic attack
before
like i don't know if you've ever
experienced a panic attack before the
people who have
i imagine the first time is a very scary
one because
you you basically don't know what's
going on you just have this very
primordial feeling that
something's very very wrong um but
there's no there's nothing you can do
about it you just
it's bigger than you it's stronger than
you there's no
controlling it there's no suppressing it
there's no going through it it's just
it's just there the whole time
and like um
and then slowly as i started learning
you know a few tricks to to sort of
deal with like the initial onset of
the burnout
you know then came a bit of space of
like okay how
how do i uh fix this or how do i fix
this
um this program within myself that led
me to this place
and like a big thing for me was
connecting back to my physicality it's
like i i always used to think of like
sort of the body as being a vehicle for
my brain
like i i would be my brain i would be my
thoughts i would be the
like all my skills were related to
thinking all my skills were related to
the brain you know like um i i
i was just in quite a bad shape
physically
and
so yeah to really regain a connection
with like you know the thing that i
would do was like
i would calculate if i was tired you
know i would go like all right i slept
seven hours last night uh you know i
didn't drink
so i should be fine to work
a full day now that's that's how i would
calculate it instead of sitting down and
thinking like all right how do i feel
like am i tired am i am i feeling
energized like like i'm just completely
disconnected from
like the physical sensation of the body
and the physical cues the body was
giving me and that's that's all panic
attack is really just like
your body screaming for attention or
screaming like all right
you're not listening to the signals i'm
giving you
like uh please please take take some
care so yeah i mean i started to
incorporate like
some fitness some
a lot of yoga like yoga sort of became
my uh
my safe place my my way of
returning to the body
uh returning to like some sort of uh
calmness some sort of a
calm-mindedness because we call
mindfulness where i wasn't in like this
complete state of panic and anxiety the
whole time
i like uh
so yeah i mean
i basically when
applied like all the skills i've learned
as a poker player and i started just
analyzing myself as as a human like okay
what am i doing like how do i work
what areas are fit for for improvement
like
uh how do other successful people do it
i started hiring people to explain
things to me
you know i started getting like a lot of
private uh
uh i started talking about a
psychologist i started talking with uh
uh
a life coach i started talking
i hired a private trainer just all these
people to just like already i don't have
any of this knowledge and it seems to me
it seems quite apparent to me that i
need this
so
yeah i mean that's that's like that's
always been
lately my mode is like if i want to know
something i just pay something to pay
somebody to explain it to me
and that that i found was really really
helpful
wow thank you thanks for sharing that
and going so deep on vulnerable on the
anxiety and the panic attacks that you
faced myself i haven't experienced
anything that's that wild i'm sure some
of the audience have had panic attacks
anxiety that they've struggled with and
yet that was really interesting that it
came from a disconnect between the mind
and the body and almost like the body
screaming out for some attention that
you were neglecting most likely because
all your time was on the mind playing
poker and yeah i like that you said like
basically was like getting that
reconnection and it sounds like you used
that self-awareness skill set that came
up earlier to look for answers but
rather than applying to the pocket
concept of is this a bias this is my
intuition how to think through hands you
applied the same concepts to your body
into yourself into your life so i think
that's really interesting how these
skills we learn as poker players can
often cross over and again you also use
the skill of seeking advice if i'm
listening to you throughout this
conversation you've always looked for
answers you've always looked for experts
who can fast track your journey so again
when you had panic attacks you didn't
know what was happening in your first
inkling was self-awareness check in with
the body and then find experts who know
things i don't know so how is that going
at the moment it sounds like it's gonna
be a long journey do you feel like
you're you've made a lot of progress in
that and are you out the other side of
these panic attacks in the burnout and
yes where are you at right now with that
yeah i mean like i i would still say i'm
i'm somewhat in the recovery phase like
uh
the i mean the period that i talked
about right now is like the last one and
a half here i've sort of like a year and
a half ago was sort of the moment where
the burnout happened
and then like uh
i spent a few months just being unable
to do any sort of poker related thing
just
because because like and any sort of
work i would do would just immediately
activate like all the circuits and
would just send me back down into a
spiral
um so i had to be really really careful
with that because like the the burnout i
have
i mean that's also what they've told me
professionally because it was quite
severe
and i think one of the reasons um and
that's also like one of the reasons why
i wanted to share it is like
i feel like a lot of poker players are
sort of close to this moment
and
especially right now with like the
pandemic and
uh like all that's happened the past two
years
the stakes becoming so high and the
competition becoming so fierce
it's like um
you know if you watch these super high
rollers
and and somebody busts and gets like a
really bad beat and they just sit there
and they just take it and they just you
know they don't flinch they don't like i
always used to think of that as like a
really
impressive thing and that's that's
something that i tried to emulate it's
like whenever i was playing live poker i
would just you know i would get a beat
like somebody would make like a really
bad play against me with a huge pot
uh you make a huge suck out and i would
just sit there and take it like a champ
but actually
that's that's a very unnatural thing to
do and that's like a you're pushing down
you're suppressing all the emotions
because like it means something to you
like like uh you know it sucks getting a
bad beat like
if you're playing a life tournament
you've made three days of investment in
that tournament you're on the end of day
three and somebody just points to you
and wins that's that it feels really
unfair and you can you can be quite
angry about that but like um you know
the person that jumps up and starts
shouting and cursing at people you know
you get like a phil hellmuth style where
like i'll burn this i'll burn this place
down and whatnot
it's like
that's actually
i mean i don't i'm not saying that's a
great reaction but it's a very natural
one and it's sort of a natural way for
your body to release
uh that sort of stress and anger that
it's feeling
uh and what i was doing i was just i was
just bottling it down
without without finding like an
appropriate uh place for for
for for expression for it
so yeah like um
that that's that's something that i
would really like to tell people like if
you have this feeling that you're
suppressing these kind of things all the
time
uh just because it's not socially
acceptable or something like fine find
an outlet for it because because it's
really important that it doesn't build
up
and where i am now is like
i feel like i have a good handle on it i
feel like i have a good grip on
um
uh on sort of what i need to feel good
and what i need to recover well
i do still feel quite vulnerable
like i do still feel like
uh you know if i play at the session for
two days and i'm a bit more tired you
know i can sort of feel the tension
building up and i feel like the
i guess the fear of
going back into a burnout scenario where
your body is just not capable of
functioning as you wanted them
um
so so
i'm not
i wouldn't say i'm past it
by any means but i do find that i have
like a better grip on it now
and yeah
and then like now i'm really in sort of
the area of exploration where i'm sort
of
you know
testing the waters again testing my own
limits again like uh
in two weeks i'll be playing my first
live tournament in in two years
that's like a really like it's a it's a
2k in amsterdam and i can honestly say
i've never been more nervous about a
tournament than i've ever been
like
and i can get quite nervous about
tournaments
like
i i can get excited and i can get like
all right this is gonna happen
but like this tournament is like a
really special one for me because
um you know i'm sort of going back uh to
the place that i was but i'm going back
as a much different person and i don't
know really how that person is going to
react
and like i've also told myself like if
if
because it feels like poker can quite
easily trigger these kind of panics
because you you know you're playing a
hand and you get like this shot of
adrenaline and like uh somebody's
looking at you intensely you get like
all confrontational
or you feel like you make a mistake and
like all of these can can trigger quite
strong biological systems within
yourself
so it's it's a really big challenge for
me and i'm really curious to see how it
goes
and like uh i've made extra sure to do
my whole preparation for it but
you know i'm gonna take extra rest i'm
gonna be very mindful of
whatever comes up and uh and i've also
accepted that
um if it doesn't feel right that i'll
just quit halfway the tournament like
that's that's that's something that's
like
a realistic option for me right now but
it's something that i'm willing to try
yeah amazing yeah it sounds like for you
it's been a long journey back to uh
hopefully back to good form and good
health and yeah it feels like you went
through
a lot of inquiries with yourself and i
think it's really interesting the way
you talked about
emotions and as poker players we often
get told to suppress them and we look at
the high stakes guys who can take the
bad beat to the high rollers you go wow
i want to be him but behind the scenes
often those guys perhaps perhaps or
create creating characteristics in terms
of suppressing emotions which aren't
healthy or at some point might not be
healthy for them if for yourself it
sounds like having a regular output for
your emotions doing something physical
by the sounds of it is very very healthy
for you so other poker players because i
know a lot of players listening to this
will be a little bit detached from their
bodies they will be almost like training
themselves to show less emotions to feel
less emotions even is there any kind of
advice you would give to those based on
your experiences to uh just check in
with your body more and also give
yourself an outlet for your emotions
because often in the poker set in it's
this it's not encouraged it's actually
almost like frowned upon for showing
your emotions so there's any outlets you
could save other poker players that you
found useful for yourself
yeah well i mean like the the first
i would mention is like outlets that are
sort of not acceptable for you like
that's an outlet that i would use myself
very often like sort of
like even like a mild substance abuse
like i would go on and off about smoking
cigarettes for years like i had a really
hard time quitting and i had a really
hard time quitting because i didn't
understand why i was smoking cigarettes
like you know if you smoke a cigarette
there's nicotine in there there's like a
a way of breathing consciously like even
if you're breathing smoke it's like
it's almost like a breathing exercise
and like smoking is a way to calm the
system down to calm yourself down
but yeah it's obviously not a very
it's a great solution in the short term
but it's a terrible solution in the long
term
so like if you ever notice yourself that
you sort of need
these things to unwind to compensate for
the fact that uh you're suppressing
these emotions so like it can be
weed alcohol or gaming or like even if
you feel like
every time you feel uncomfortable you
need to look at your phone or something
like if you have that sort of patterns
within you
i would say that some that that is
something that's very interesting to
explore
and to try and substitute those patterns
for
something healthy for something fun like
you know like if after every
uh tournament you uh you go kickboxing
like that's a that's a great that's a
great thing to do i think like uh
or uh
if that's not your like
you also have to find out a bit like
what what sort of
emotions you're
suppressing because some people have
more anger some people have more sadness
some people have more
uh you know some people have so much
elation and excitement when they're
playing that that's the one that they're
suppressing so you kind of have to
figure out
how you work
yourself first
and then find like an appropriate outlet
so so like for me that's yoga because
like uh
um
like the thing that i usually
suppress the most is sort of
disappointment and sadness
so like yoga is like a really nice way
to
not
completely drain yourself but at the
same time you know up your uh
up your home hormone level that up your
dope your your natural baseline dopamine
level of it
um
to to just feel comfortable within the
body it's a great way to relieve stress
like stress builds up in the body like
if you don't release it so like
yoga was a great one for me but
honestly i think there's a million
things to do but the most important
thing is to realize is to try and do the
research first it's like
okay what am i suppressing and what what
is it that i'm looking for and
it's very interesting
you also mentioned that
i thought it was interesting when you
mentioned that i was
i slept seven hours so i should i should
feel great right you let your brain
decide if you were feeling great and
that's indeed like one of these skills
right that you sort of develop in poker
like i don't listen to my i listen to my
body that at some point you you you
indeed become so disconnected and also
in terms of suppressing emotions i mean
i have a latin american wife who's very
emotional and then i think a lot of
poker players can relate to this right
that
then a lot of the skill sets that you
build
by becoming a good poker player don't
necessarily
transfer to having a
emotional loving relationship for
example right
and it sounds like again the
disconnection with your body not reading
the science because you're just blocking
it it's definitely one of these
sort of
negative
effects or you know
that can come with becoming a successful
poker player yeah but i mean it's very
similar to the thing we talked about
earlier is like you have this rational
side to yourself and this intuitive side
and this intuitive side is is worth
discovering because it gives you
information but it's not like you should
always listen to your intuition it's
like if i would always listen to my
intuition i would be eating chocolate
all day i would be like 180 kilos i
would smoke you know like like if i just
always did what my what i intuitively
wanted to do that's not a very great way
to live but at the same time there are
nuggets of information there is there is
important stuff there
and the trick is to to to create like
this
sort of symbiosis with yourself
in which uh you know what your biases
are you know what your your standard
patterns are but you also know
what happens when when
when something
something valuable is coming through
when some some valuable nugget of
information that enters the system
so yeah
i mean i can relate to a lot of things
but you went you went to a hell of a
journey i would say
and looking back at basically you know
we talked about multiple obstacles
throughout your career
um what would you say is the
most important thing
that
your career so far has taught you
uh my most important thing i mean it's
it's that sense of self-discovery and
wonder is that that would be a very very
important factor i guess
um
also there there's always been this
sense in poker where
uh
the the
that i sort of learned to trust myself
and to trust my own ability
and like um
especially as a poker player there's
like a lot of noise
from your surroundings from your friends
they're like oh yeah should you do this
or like uh oh did you lose so much
really you know there's always
there's this uh this sense of doubt
surrounding you and like i've been
pretty successful
over the last few years but i imagine
like
especially people who
because because
you know like to the outside world it's
really easy to show like oh yeah i want
a big life tournament that was a huge
score and then everybody will be like oh
that's that's great but especially for
guys who are like playing cash games or
like where it's not so well publicized
uh i think you can get like into an area
where your environment is really like
constantly doubting you
constantly thinking like hey is this
even right for him or
you know
what about the future and that that kind
of thing
um
like as soon as i learned to get rid of
that noise and just accept like all
right
i'm a poker player this is who i am this
is what i believe in
this is what i enjoy doing
uh it sort of made it much easier
to live basically it's like you're not
so reactive to whatever happens around
you also like it sounds like there's
less pressure right you have nothing
left to prove
yeah and and and and i i think this is
something like a lot of people encounter
in life
especially not poker players actually
it's like you get sort of forced onto
this path and everybody wants you to
stay on that path
and sometimes the path makes a lot of
sense
and
you should never forgo good advice
but there's also this this
sometimes the path that you see is is
very different and you should explore
that that sort of option
and you should go
yeah
sounds like i'm going for like a sort of
a cliche follow your heart thing but um
i don't think everybody should follow
their heart i think that's terrible
advice but i think you should at least
research it i think you should at least
discover like sort of what your
ideas that
you would really like to accomplish and
that's something that poker taught me is
like
you can be independent in that sense you
can
make your own decisions
uh
it's just a sense of letting go of that
the noise that's around you
how
i'm curious like
if you now show up to play a poker
session right you have to
play poker again
how is that
different compared to
like one and a half two years ago
in terms of your experience like a day a
grind session of yours
how is that different i mean in terms of
experience like uh
i've become a lot more aware about like
removing distractions which is just
because i i was confronted with the only
limits of my physicality
so like uh
i know like when i now play a session
you know i i have to make sure that all
other distractions are off i was never
that strict with it in the past
like i have a really strict preparation
before a tournament or before session
like i have a routine which i have to go
to
um i take much more conscious use of my
brakes because in tournaments you have
like a break every every hour for five
minutes
so like uh i i
i always make to go make sure to go out
on my balcony or to do like some sort of
yoga pose
like something to recharge the system
so that's that's much different
and whilst playing like what's what's
very different to me is that i i just
feel more at peace you know i feel less
less of a
you know
gorilla
i'm a more more
more of a bird i guess like
you know i i just
flow through the session and i enjoy
what it brings to me and i'm i'm
[Music]
you know less less angry less
less less trying to battle i'm more and
more enjoying myself
because it sounds like i'll say you're
perfectly fine with where you are now
right it's like you're you're in peace
compared to before that it's like you
were playing but you didn't want to be
there you wanted to be the best so
there's a lot of
you know a little bit of competitiveness
i think is good for poker player but if
it if it blows out of proportion it
brings a lot of negativity to go with it
yeah and then and like the important
thing is always like people always say
like competitiveness is important for
poker players but
uh it's competitive within your skill
set
if you become competitive at a higher
skill set than you are capable of then
you're just you know you're just not in
a place that you should be
like
like usually the competitiveness is very
useful for making sure that you move up
in the states it's like you sometimes
see people playing really low stakes and
they just have very little
competitiveness but they actually have
the skill set but you also see like
people who just have more
competitiveness than they have skill set
and they will just bounce back from high
stakes to mid stakes high stakes and
mistakes high stakes and mistakes just
because
that they
they're just trying to to perform at the
level they can
and
that's something to be super
important to be super important to be
aware of it's very stressful i can
imagine basically i think that process
between every time you have to jump
between stakes at some point you will
start jumping less because you cannot no
longer handle this the stress that comes
with it you have to find a way right at
some point you will naturally your body
will level will level you out into where
you really belong
yeah or or
uh i mean there's also a couple other
results in the simulation which you see
very often is that people jump in stakes
and then they jump jump jump because
their competitiveness is still there but
their skill set doesn't doesn't grow
with them and then they just click over
and they just go broke but they just uh
you know
like uh
yeah yeah
it's one thing you can actually draw
back and sort of realize all right uh i
should move back or like
there's also another path in which
people just lose their mind right
yeah
yeah so it's a basically
just again right these kind of things
and it's quite clear and this is i think
it's going to be a theme of successful
poker players
you learned from all these things that
happened to you right like this person
you're describing now
he wasn't self-aware yet to realize that
indeed his competitiveness and his skill
weren't in line and that was causing the
problem and if he he had to realize that
sooner in order to be smarter with the
games he decided to play but if you
don't develop that skill you will end up
getting yeah you end up broke at some
point yeah i actually consider myself
quite lucky in that sense
like uh
i think if you would
simulate my poker career a couple times
there's definitely a few a few
results in which i end up with no money
or like quitting years ago like uh at
some point in my poker career like
always at the right moment the right
type of person seemed to come along or
like always when i needed it like sort
of the right the right type of thing
seemed to happen
like
i'm obviously very grateful for that but
i also realize
that that doesn't happen for everybody
like uh i i can remember very clear
moments within my poker career where i
was sort of at the same level
as some other guy and that guy might not
be playing anymore
and
it's it's not because i had such a
superior mindset or such a superior
study habit it was just like
blind luck in whatever came along at one
point and
i mean
there's like it's
in some sense you attract this as well
right and like
you sort of live with this idea that
like opportunities come along and you
sort of have to be ready to take them
um and that's that's what did happen for
me but i do feel very lucky that these
opportunities came along
because uh because i imagine that
there's quite a few scenarios in which
they didn't
yeah
it was interesting i'm curious what adam
thinks this is about when you mentioned
the word luck i immediately was like
i wouldn't qualif i wouldn't really
label it as luck and then you talked
about like you attract that uh i'm
definitely more
i mean
can we label that as a spiritual in that
sense like i feel like
throughout a team throughout your story
is
you've always seized opportunities that
came along right maybe that other person
that you were describing that was at the
same point that opportunity also came
along but he just didn't see it he
didn't see it as an opportunity whereas
i think you grab the opportunities as
soon as they arrive right you have a
problem you look for a solution maybe he
just has a problem
and this the solution comes by but he
doesn't see it whereas used it because
you're looking for it right
yeah
i mean also in the sense of entities and
just plain lack of hitting scores it's
like
uh
i i think i've run significantly above
ev in my lifetime
okay it's the right time um yeah and
also like the timing of sometimes of big
scores was also very important to me and
like uh i mean i can remember like a few
significant moments in which
uh you know i fell down i felt like sort
of confidence was low like
for some reason like very often a big
score would pop up like right when i
when i hit that threshold where i was
thinking like oh i mean maybe this is
not my place to be like maybe
so so i do feel lucky in that sense
like as as for the law of attraction
like i i don't really have an opinion on
that like i don't think
the universe works in like a sort of
given takeaway
uh i
i don't really think the universe cares
about
if my aces hold up against kings or not
like i i don't really
believe in that sense but i do believe
that in the sense of like the people you
attract
like obviously people are willing to
invest more time and deal if there's
more energy
which is a resource
if you are willing to listen and if you
are willing to be curious and if you are
willing to
treat that
advice with respect
yeah i find it hard to find the right
word for the law of attraction i also
don't don't necessarily agree with uh in
terms of how it's been
yeah explained commercially
but i do like i don't have a good word
for it but i do i do believe that you
know exactly when certain things arise
you're the type of person that will see
it as opportunity and grab it where yeah
like i said i think other people might
miss it
how would you describe it yeah
yeah i said just based on everything
we've let out yours today we can see
that he's got a good skill set of
self-awareness and intuition which
allows him to uh navigate his landscape
better than other people so yes there's
gonna be some look fact that's involved
but he's able to spot opportunities that
other people would like to slip by so
yeah how much fact does this look how
much is him seeing the opportunities
it's like a mixed equation where it's
hard to quantify see i think we can say
there's some luck involved but also use
a skill of self-awareness and intuition
in the right moments to
seek inwards to seek help to look for
opportunities to even like put your ego
aside i think one of the things that
interesting early in the conversation
was when you said you had the need to be
right all the time and then that's a
really hard obstacle to overcome like
you've got to put your ego aside and
start looking for counter information
that proves you wrong in order to learn
that's a stepping stone that a lot of
people can't get past so yeah i think
those attributes all come into the
umbrella of self-awareness for me so
yeah i think the self-awareness and the
intuition that you fine-tuned throughout
your career have allowed you to uh ride
your look a bit better than most of all
but also to find opportunities that have
been supportive of your of your quest so
that'd be my take
so going back to where you are now
uh
you are
you know still
recovering as as you said right you're
not that uh at full power um
in terms of in the past you were like
chasing to become the best
so because the best was kind of you know
your definition of success
what would now be sort of your
definition of success like what are you
striving towards now is it like
something that you go or is it more like
i try to live zen day to day or
like how should we see that
i mean like uh
i sort of want to perform the best
that i can
[Music]
within the parameters of me enjoying the
process and me not taking any sort of
like that's that's sort of the the
parameters i've set up for myself now
and wherever that leads me is
very much a point of discovery at this
point like that's that's really what i
don't know but i'm just trying to keep
an open mind about it i mean and not you
know try to set too many things in stone
and there's also the sense where like
i've noticed this a lot while playing
recently
is that your performance levels can
actually go up
because a very important thing like um
that i actually found out within this
period is and that's something that was
like a major obstacle
uh throughout my career before
was that i felt like i couldn't
completely perform at the level that i
wanted to
whenever like that was really big money
at stake or whenever that was like a
really high buy
and the reason why that is is stress
it's like stress
has a direct effect on your cognitive
abilities on your abilities to think and
to rationalize
and like because i've now noticed this
process and i now have like a lot more
tools to relieve this
i think
i could actually up like the level of
performance a little bit uh just because
the the knowledge base is
like the knowledge base is no different
but the performance the the execution
base the execution standard becomes
higher
and you know i've i've read like a lot
of interesting research and
talks about this where like you know
they they have like a group of people
uh and one group uh like they run like a
400 meter
into the one group they say like all
right run it at like a maximum capacity
run it as fast as you can into the other
group they say like okay run up at 85
and the average finishing time for the
85 group would actually be higher
and like sort of that sense where like
there's a little bit of relaxation
within the mind and within the body
actually allows you to to access a much
higher part or much bigger part of your
cognitive capacity
and that's that's what i find to be a
really interesting space to be in right
now
is where i feel like um you know sort of
the rest and
the improved physical well-being would
actually have like
a positive result on my on my playing
capacity
i mean if it also sounds like when
you're at
right you were hoping i remember at some
point in the conversation you were
hoping for a big score right because the
big score would magically
disappear all your problems would
disappear right if you would only get
that score so i can imagine if you get
closer to the score let's say you reach
the final table and it's like oh my god
this is the moment everything i've ever
wanted is on the line sounds quite
stressful whereas probably if now you
would be in the same situation it's like
listen i'm already really zen with
myself you know i'm just here trying to
play good so there's last like
winning
has a
a much smaller it's less important for
you in a different you understand what i
mean it's it's still important of course
but there's less dependent on it whereas
in the other scenario it was my
happiness my everything is dependent on
this win whereas now it's like yeah
would be great obviously
yeah for sure because uh um like it's
also something that i'm noticing a lot
because i'm now staking like a few young
guys and coaching them and sort of
guiding them in the process of becoming
a really good high stakes regular
uh like um
you just see the same mental blocks
that i didn't see but like i didn't spot
them by myself
but uh i saw them in other people and
then i started reflecting on like this
process of like wait actually whenever i
felt like in these high pressure
situations i like if i if i if i look
back on them now like i actually
had less cognitive ability i i was i was
thinking less clearly like
uh you know i can i can remember like um
you know when when i first started
playing one caves online and i would
very often like i would bust like at the
9th 10th 11th spot and and i would just
always feel like it was due to bad luck
but i was actually just performing worse
in those tournaments than i would in
like a 109 tournament just because it
meant so much to me which increased the
stress which increased like the
adrenaline and the cortisol which
actually blocks out your your ability to
think about something like it's like uh
you know if if if you put somebody if
you put a cognitive test to somebody and
they have to answer like 10 simple
questions and you put them in a very
stressful situation they're just going
to do worse they're just going to do
worse on such a test
and like so for me
like a big part now is that i actually
take a lot of time to make my decisions
in high pressure situations
whereas previously i always felt like i
needed to rush them
and
at least physically felt like i needed
to rush them and
it's it's really fun being able to to
distribute this knowledge to to like
other players to like guys i'm staking
right now
is because because the same thing
happens to everybody and like now that
not everybody notices it it's like you
just it's just harder to play
your a game when the stakes are higher
or what it means more
it's it's just the fact of life like
like uh right now
like if you look at eight or nine years
ago
the skill gap between like the high the
super high stakes or the best guys
and
the group below it was like huge that
was like a huge skill gap
and and so the best guys would be the
guys with the most knowledge
who knew how
to play poker the best basically
but these days the skill the skill gap
is much much smaller and like also the
ability to research it is like there's
so many tools and resources available
so like a really big part comes down to
execution and especially in tournaments
where like
you sort of you're constantly leveraging
your
your money because like uh
constantly like the decisions just mean
a hundred times as much at the end of
the tournament than i mean at the
beginning
so like to be able to perform
uh to the best of your capacity
even when
it's very stressful and when when
uh when there's a lot going on
that that became like a really important
skill set that i that i actually lacked
in the past that i feel i now
possess uh in some sense
what was it mainly so obviously what was
it mainly the circumstance that change
or is it your
like your your your perspective on the
situation your mindset towards the
situation like when you you mentioned
that you coached what kind of advice do
you then give
if they are in those situations right
because they cannot wait until their
situ environment changes like yours
yeah i mean i mean
some part of it is experience i think
like to just
go through that situation a couple times
is really useful
that's also why i think it would never
be a great idea to buy pieces of
somebody who's gonna be playing super
high rollers for the first time
like if i look back on them
oh my earlier yours
it's like uh you know the people and a
difference from person to person like so
some people are more affected by this
and some people are less affected by
this
but uh uh yeah so like experience is a
big one so like whenever you're moving
up just make sure you have really small
pieces of yourself and just test the
waters
oh wait you're saying you should have
small pieces yourself and you're saying
nobody should buy pieces and you that's
kind of the situation we're in right now
right
okay just just so that i follow
that's a great advertisement for myself
but your experience right so yeah no but
like i'm not experienced and it's like
the super high rollers for example like
uh
um but yeah so experience is one part of
it the other one is uh you know
there's some very simple tricks to deal
with this it's like forcing yourself to
take time is a really important time
it's a really important one if you're
playing online final tables you always
get like a time bank of like a 250 40
seconds or something
if you notice you're almost never
hitting that time bank that probably
means that you're
rushing your decisions too much
and you're not considering all the
factors that you could have
um there there's a
there's some simple breathing exercises
just breathing correctly while you're
playing it's very very important it
calms down the whole system that calms
down
uh you know lowers heart rate lowers
like the stress levels in your blood it
allows just for a lot more clarity like
if you ever feel like you're playing and
you feel like you're sort of
the the information gets murky where
like
you sort of you're making a decision but
then you're second guessing yourself and
then you think oh maybe i should do it
you know like you you're not following
like
a lot of logical coherent
steps of of getting to a decision
that that basic that usually means that
that you just have too much stress in
the system to make that decision
and like at that point it just becomes
important like if you feel that just
step away from the computer for one
second you know just uh you know
get a breath of fresh air
there's some there's some really great
breathing exercises you can do while
playing
you know just just timing your breath
just making
uh your exhale quite a bit longer than
your inhale
and it really just just calms the whole
system down and that's when you can make
a good decision
yeah the body
reacts very
counterproductive in those kind of
situations right it tenses up you out
hold your breath in stressful situations
without noticing it so yeah less breath
less oxygen to the brain at the moment
you need it the most
yeah and that's that's sort of the fun
thing about bulk right that's why it is
what it is because
because like that's sort of the
challenge it's like who can
it's not it's not
like we're not all
solving math formulas and seeing who can
make the most
you know who can
uh
finish a calculation it's like who can
finish a calculation within a time
constraint and with like the
psychological element of like there's a
pressure losing money and there's a
pressure there of winning money and
there's a you know there's a whole
dynamic around it like that's that's why
it's such a beautiful game at the same
time
because it's funny because money the the
money aspect and the pressure that i
remember all the way in the beginning
you said that was actually one of the
things that you liked about poker
remember play money poker doesn't in the
end it also kind of hurt you in a
certain way
that's the way that's the way it is when
most things run they're good
a little bit right and then you get a
lot of it and it becomes it becomes
damaging
yes and then you have to
you have to find your way of coping with
that
yeah so i think for
me what i'd like to know right now is
what is your greatest challenge going
forward or you could answer it in the
way of what you're most excited about
going forward so you talk to us about
the burnout and recovering from that and
then you're going back into some live
tournaments with a lot of curiosity
targets for like at this stage of your
career your life what are some of the
challenges that poker still possesses
for you all the things that excite you
going forward
i mean like uh because i started taking
a few guys that became like a really
nice challenge for me
like uh this idea of like
all right there's there's this
like basically like a bunch of copies of
me in a younger form they're all making
the same mistakes they're all doing the
same things but at the same time they're
very smart guys and they're a little bit
uh
you know they're sometimes very
convinced of their own opinion and
rightly so because they are smart i like
the sort of this idea of like how do i
transfer this knowledge how do i work
with these people
how do i do this in a sense that it's
still fun to me but it's still enjoyable
to me
that's that's like a really nice
challenge i enjoy at the moment
also at the same time like
um
staking guys requires like you you
record requires letting go of control
like like when you are playing yourself
you know you win or lose you have
yourself to blame you you are the person
in charge
you are the person responsible like
i noticed when i started taking guys
like i almost you know they would be
deep in a tournament and they would be
doing something and like my fingers
would age you know like i would be
railing that and i would be like
ah like you're this is exactly this type
kind of stuff we've talked about like
you're making the same mistake over and
over again and and like
like almost
railing
horses you had like both a financial and
emotional investment in
was getting way more stressful than
playing yourself because because like
uh because i was a bit of a control
freak i didn't know this about myself
but apparently i am
and um
so yeah that's a big challenge for me
it's learning to work with that learning
to like all right you you have these
guys that you're working with you trust
them you know trust the process trust
them to do well
and
you know don't be so invested in
in
getting caught up into the moment
yeah
yeah i love that i recognize a lot of
that uh
i remember when i
started switch from playing for my for
myself basically and having sort of
other players play for you if we can
just name it like that it's indeed like
suddenly
yeah you need to suddenly feel way less
control right especially i know you and
me we we take our performance quite
seriously and you know we try to and
then if you see that someone else
doesn't it's like oh
yeah
it's interesting it will get better at
time
yeah i've noticed that as well and it's
also a good life lesson you know like uh
[Music]
the world is a very hard place to
control so like uh
you know just getting to work with that
a little bit and
accepting that some things are out of
your hands and
[Music]
figuratively let the chips fall where
they're made that's a that's a pretty
good good life lesson right there and
technically speaking at the moment yours
rise who
what
what what what can i wake him up for
poker related what are you excited about
playing poker yourself
oh yeah what am i excited about i'm uh i
recently uh
started improving my headset game a lot
like
started to put like a lot of study time
in there because uh
you know you're playing super high
stakes
even online like the the stakes that are
available are very high but they're all
small field
so like the the
frequency would when we actually gets
get to a heads-up phase is
like it's way more often than it used to
be
so it becomes like a really important
spot and like because the headset plays
so much differently to all the other
spots
it's like a sort of understudied area so
i always like to find these spots where
like all right
sort of
what is everybody doing and where is
everybody lacking and to really dive
into that spot where like okay this is
this is where i feel like i can make
some money against the rest so yeah
heads-up is one area where
where i think that's currently the case
it's a good
time investment
area-wise to
to to study now
and uh yeah pokemon is like uh yeah
poker just got legalized in the
netherlands
so like uh i'm i'm just playing the
schedule a bit seeing seeing how it
develops
and
i mean i sort of enjoy the online grind
i i find it really comfortable
but i'm also looking forward to the live
tournaments but then it's all on the
contagion that it's actually uh that's
actually possible for me
it's probably also quite pleasantv right
quite a big patron between second and
first place
in the house up you mean in tournaments
yeah
yeah yeah for sure like it's huge i like
uh especially because a lot of the the
tournaments are progressive knockouts
now so like then like sort of
the last remaining heads-up becomes like
33 of the tournament
like um
yeah they're huge and like they're
really high ev spots because you
basically get to play a up sit and go
against the non-specialist for like a
huge amount of money
so like uh
yeah
like the variance is obviously huge in
those
but
you know if you can craft out like a
couple percent roi in that situation
you're talking like ten tens of
thousands of euros on a yearly basis
so like uh
i have a feeling other people are gonna
become had some specialists now after
you said that
yeah i like uh and i found live poker
like life tells i found like a sort of
understudied area
all right i'm very curious about that so
when i mean we definitely talk about
that because i'm very curious about that
area as well
that's uh
that's an area like especially because
i'm considering to play a lot of live
again in the future
it's like an area that would be very
interesting for me to dive into a bit
like i was always a bit arrogant about
it again just
lifetimes that's just that's just for
the bad players and like guys who don't
know what to do what they're doing
and um
i mean
that was actually because like a lot of
the people who claimed to be really good
at lifestyles were just very bad players
with very poor results
like
um so so i never really took it
seriously
but uh
but i see now
that there's actually a lot of merit to
it
and that it could actually be quite
interesting to play around with a bit
but it's an area that i never
specialized in so it will be quite new
for me
it's funny also what you mentioned with
the you saying that a lot of the
tournaments now become progressive
knockouts that's different than normal
knockout
yeah normal knockout is like you just
have a set bounty on you so like say you
play a player 500 tournament there's a
250 dollar bounty for knocking you out
um and it doesn't really and like the
progressive one is where like half of
the bounty goes on your
it goes to your bounty and half the
balticos
close to your goes to your cashier
so like uh
the
bounty on your head increases
we already talked about how complicated
tournaments are compared to for example
cash games but they keep on making it
more complicated huh yeah so there's
infinite variables like uh
like seriously if if you were to
sort of use a super computer to
to to solve every single spot in poke in
tournament poker
compared to every single spot in cash
games
i think you would need like
like like 100 or a thousand times
more powerful computer to really
get get to the same result at the end
i i i i believe that i believe that but
that makes it a lot more fun as well of
course
it's like a lot more to think about
and especially i think where you are now
you can appreciate it more right because
you know you're in a very comfortable
place you feel very good you know you
so you could actually enjoy the
complications whereas i can imagine that
if you're still more in a struggling
phase of your career like oh they only
make it difficult and was already so
hard and i cannot move up in a sense
then it you're kind of fighting fighting
the reality whereas if you're in a more
comfortable position you can appreciate
the beauty of it right because again the
outcome matters less
and it's it's also just
really fun and that's that's like a huge
part in
keeping your motivation and keeping uh
the sort of intensity of what you're
willing to play it's like if something
is no longer fun to you then all of it
just becomes such a drag and it just
becomes such a grind
i like the fact that there is so many
variables to think about just
uh you know you're just always working
on a puzzle that's impossible to solve
for you and once you've accepted that
it's impossible to solve it actually
becomes quite fun to translate and then
when you're close to completing the
puzzle they'll invent
another
form of poker tournaments which is even
more complicated i've i've never felt
close to completing the puzzle but
i don't know about you no no me neither
me neither the puzzle keeps on growing
right
the puzzle keeps on getting bigger the
more you learn you think like okay these
are the edges of the puzzle let me just
complete it now and then you're at the
edge like [ __ ] there's it just grew
again how does it every time become
bigger
i mean i mean i know for myself that
whenever i feel like i'm close to
completing the puzzle that actually
means i'm becoming close-minded
like that's when the arrogance gets too
high of a level and the curiosity are
too low
i've got one final question so i think
for a lot of law slash mid stakes
players
the thought of moving to high stakes
whatever that high stakes definition
definition is for them it can seem like
a real big jump so for yourself did you
notice any
mindset shifts you had to make to go
from being a midstax player to a high
stakes player was any sort of
transformation or
important mental jumps you had to make
to mentally start playing those higher
games
yeah i always always like uh
an important factor for me to consider
like
uh when i first moved up to high stakes
i would play very paranoid i would i
would play with like all right i'm just
moved up in stakes and now i'm sitting
with all these geniuses and like uh like
every time they would do something i
would start second-guessing myself like
uh you know how did he block me there
like
where is like if i would just be in my
comfort zone i wouldn't think twice
about it and that would make
you know if you start guess second
guessing yourself like your performance
levels are gonna drop
drop to the floor so that's a really
it's really important not to be paranoid
and like to realize like right
is is just some guy with two cards you
know who's trying to play a game
and he's there's there's not like this
wizard and
the
like sort of the difference between
uh this incredibly great player and this
sort of mediocre player you know is not
that big as you think it is
so it's very important not to play
paranoid like to sort of recognize when
you are
and if you are playing paranoid like you
should do either one of two things is
like don't play those games like just
not playing games that you're not
comfortable then is a good advice i
think and like
there's always this focus on moving up
but i think like when you know you're
ready
you'll feel it and you'll feel
comfortable in those games like if
you're playing in a game where you don't
feel the edge
it's very likely it shouldn't be a game
that you're playing in so like uh
yeah sometimes people look to move up
from like some
level of necessity they think like oh
yeah i need to move up as soon as
possible whereas i think the truth the
opposite is actually true
like you know when you're ready and
you'll feel it when you're ready and
like um
and yeah and to not be so paranoid like
uh you know like and sometimes when
you're feeling paranoid sort of try to
monitor those things
like uh you know if you feel like you're
you're
uh your cbs strategy is not working in
the higher stakes you know look at your
own data just to see if you're actually
performing worse than
uh in
in mid stage
i also feel like reflecting on your own
data is a huge tool to do and to do
anyway like i would often do this with
my horses it's like
i would filter for their mistakes games
and i would filter for their high stakes
games and they would show just vastly
different stats you know they would just
be either much tighter or much more
aggressive in in the higher stakes games
is because because uh they're focusing
so much on the spot they constantly
think like oh this is my most important
tournament this is the one where i
really gotta go for it
whereas actually like if you're moving
up you should just you know
lay back a bit you know and
see what develops and it actually makes
sense to
to to to just really stick to your
baseline strategy and to really stick to
the thing that you believe is good
and like mistakes or like your lower
stakes is actually more area to explore
and to discover
instead of the other way around
and it's actually quite common it's like
when they then move up they feel like
now they have to suddenly do suddenly do
something special in order to win i
often say like
the reason
okay you are now allowed to move up is
because you played in a certain way then
it makes no sense whatsoever to suddenly
change the way you play when moving up
no you deserve to move up because of the
way you play so just play your own game
right and then these people get too
paranoid and start doing oh you know
they kind of force aggression because
they feel like or you know they start to
get stations because here at higher
stakes they do find enough bluffs in
this spot right
it's actually very funny because because
paranoid
being paranoid is actually
a symptom of stress too much stress
like if your system is overloaded with
stress you become paranoid because
you're you're so active you're like uh
like that's what stress is right this is
sort of the warning signal to the body
like
something's gonna happen
so like being paranoid is just a result
uh sometimes i think of just being more
stressful in the situation
and
that just has a cognitive decline like
that that's where you notice the
cognitive decline it's like a paranoid
decision-making process is not a good
decision-making process
so like yeah
yeah i think that's a very
i feel like that's something a lot of
players struggle with
yeah and i think that's a very
interesting area to discover to to
explore experience
yeah very good advice and yeah i like
that you paired two things together
there one was that kind of
self-awareness of am i being paranoid is
my game kind of deviate in then also you
paired that with the players you were
staking to get them to check their
sample sizes their mid-sticks games this
their high-stakes games they've got that
kind of data element as well as well as
that kind of feel-based element of that
paranoia or not feeling comfortable in
the games see i think you can pair both
those together it could be very good
warning signs to uh avoid those games or
say you're not ready to play those games
at that stage of your career so yeah
great answer so any of you got any
parting questions for yours before we
let them go
was there anything you would still like
to share we forgot to ask you that you
know it's our first podcast so uh
no like uh
recently i've been writing a lot about
like this past period and like my
experiences with burnout and
um
like i was sort of curious if people
would be interested if i would publish
anything of that because like there's
just like a
um
there's two points to it for me where
like i feel like sharing some of it
could be helpful to some people but at
the same time i just i don't want to put
out like this
and i scare people off like i'm never
becoming a poker player after reading
this story of sadness and difficulty and
struggle and like i would just be
curious if people would be
interested in that sort of content and
then it's up to me to
decide if i um
if i if i'll start publishing that kind
of content
all right i'm i'm i'm personally uh a
favor of uh sharing especially like you
said if you feel like
you know you're at a stage of your
career where you have learned something
that could help other people and you
feel motivated to share that
so i think it's also like do you think
this will help a lot of players
right you think it's a topic that
doesn't get talked about often
yeah it's it's like after i've had the
experience i i actually
you know approached a few people and i
asked them like like has this ever
occurred to you or like this has
happened to you like
i it turned out that like a lot of these
things were much more common within the
poker community than i expected them to
be
and there's also like this thing about
the high stakes scene is like
there's a lot of like
like performance substance abuse in that
sense like you know people are using
heart rate blockers or like uh
anti-anxiety medication or adderall to
perform well
and like um
that's that's something that that i feel
doesn't get talked about enough and i
would be interested if that conversation
will be opened up a little bit more
about like uh sort of
the difference between the image that
we're projecting like all we're all
super successful high stakes players
but we don't really talk about the
struggles that we face
when
when people are not watching so to speak
i think there's definitely a
would say in
need out there um
[Music]
so yeah but we can leave a comment if
for people listening and are interested
in that shoe doesn't mess it leave a
comment
um
then uh let's motivate yours uh to share
his story so he can help help the poker
community become more mentally healthy
physically healthy as well can we uh
follow yoga classes with mr yours
my girlfriend is a yoga teacher so yeah
you're more than welcome to book a class
with me thank you all right i'll be
happy to
all right we're yours uh i wanna thank
you a lot for coming on and uh you've
been a great guest you've exceeded my
expectations
yeah i mean it was great talking to you
guys and then thanks for the
inspiring questions
i felt like we covered a lot of ground
there
i feel so as well so thank you all for
listening as well audience
uh any suggestions shoot us a message
leave a comment
and we'll see you
in the next episode anything you would
like to say adam to close off
thank you euris again for your time and
your wisdom and yeah see you guys on the
next episode so adam
what were your main takeaways
off our good friend yours rice aka bill
lewinsky
well that was a great conversation i
think we went very deep at times but we
got a lot of wisdom from urus and i
think the audience will get a lot of
benefits from that so myself some of the
things i was really uh fascinated about
was his approach to uh working through
his problems through the skill set of
self-awareness so very often we saw him
hit obstacles and down swings and he
went internal to either reflect or to uh
look at his intuition versus his biases
he would very often turn to a network of
people to help him find answers which
again self-aware people very often turn
to others to help them whereas people
have got more ego or lack self-awareness
often try and solve their own problems
so yeah it was really fascinating to see
like that skill set coming up over and
over again another thing that was really
a good takeaway for me was the way he
approached his intuition as like this
fine-tuning skill that he wanted to uh
cultivate but he didn't want to like
over-cultivate so he didn't want to
listen to his intuition fully and when i
prompted him are you an intuitive player
he didn't want to say he was because he
cast himself as like on the fence of
both i'm intuitive but i'm due to your
and yeah i thought it was really
interesting how he's spent a lot of time
trying to cultivate this inner feeling
of what his intuition is but also
understanding what his biases feel like
on the other side so yeah i think that
was a i've never heard it discussed in
that way or a player talk about the work
they put into that attribute so yeah i
see them the main things i was one of
the best things i took away from that
was the ability to uh look for
work and self-awareness when things are
getting tough and go deeper and deeper
internally and then also to uh look for
answers from other people and then
cultivate that skill set of intuition
and yeah go side by side with um your
kind of cognitive abilities and then
finally i think that the last thing was
the way he talked about his burnout and
how he came up with the side of that and
again a self-awareness skill set but
this time we thought about getting more
in tune with the body which i think was
very it's undertalked about as poker
players we're very often cognitive
logical people and we neglect the body
until it screams out with a panic attack
or anxiety so yeah i think it's really
nice to hear him reconnect with his body
but also to uh yeah basically valuable
tools going forward that he'd be able to
use
long term so hopefully other players
going through tough times will be able
to get more achievement their own body
and use to make physical practices to uh
yeah basically balance starts a bit
better so yeah to kind of yeah it's
interesting like that you basically
you're trying to become a high sex poker
player you know you're building a
certain skill set that suddenly in other
areas that skill set that you've built
so hard for you know like the kind of
you know ignoring a little bit what your
body is trying to tell you right what he
was saying and then suddenly that kind
of backfires right that doesn't really
work uh anymore so i thought that was
very interesting and also to become very
conscious
uh
of what you actually want right for
example he felt that given the fact that
he was competitive and he felt like oh
you're high six poke play so you have to
play these high sex tournaments right
you have to try to become the best
but
that you really have to
um yeah pause for a second then ask
yourself why right why am i trying to to
achieve this
and i thought that was very interesting
and if i've done a couple of con yeah a
little bit counterintuitive things maybe
decisions in my career uh because i
stopped and
was like okay what do i actually want
right what is my definition of success
and i might make different choices
choices that were against the
yeah the the the societal norm in poker
right that's very eevee driven you just
it's quite simple you make the decision
that's most plausibly
right yeah and uh so yeah if i found
that very
very interesting as well
and indeed yeah like how how he managed
to learn from his mistakes but i have a
feeling that this is going to be an
ongoing ongoing pattern
uh throughout when we get more guests on
right that they will they are self-aware
they know how to reflect on their
mistakes they know how to get better
so yeah i'm very i'm very excited very
happy how the first episode went and uh
curious to
have more guests on to spot the patterns
that
make them so successful
yeah me too can't wait for the next
guest and for the audience hopefully
you've enjoyed our first episode as you
might be able to guess we're freestyling
it just a little bit we're gonna
probably get a bit more crisp as we go
