so we had a little bit of a false start
okay a little bit of a false start in
the beginning
as apparently i didn't run as
administrator
and as always guys same [ __ ] usual
spell suspects at the table i see flusu
i see chips and crips
i see big blind bats as always i see
bricky t
stadium in the house what's up mrs
steden
pick my best man we always take a little
bit by batch we would just start off
with a library race straight away
that what that is exactly actually what
i was planning but
he didn't fall for it he didn't fall for
it
okay okay big veteran you women
that's just too good a little bit of a
nitty fault but you know
starting slowly today guys that's
starting slowly
zipping on the green tea as always
this time we went for the the uganda
and we're going uganda style
got a little suited ace on the gun let's
see if we can
make some magic happen not my flop
but i'll still give it a try maybe he
folds you never know
he did in default
we have a king we have a king
see a turn let's see a turn let's see a
turn
just confirming if we are live yes we
are indeed live
oh
oh we face a little 5x here we're not
gonna do a lovely column but i feel like
king jack may be still in there gypsy is
thinking about it for quite a while
and decided to check
and he had the jack 10 didn't follow
through
probably wise decision mr chips equips
you're probably watching the stream
you know we have a big call button
you know we have a big car button
night and suited ah [ __ ] it
now i'm gonna go
i gotta do something fancier i'm gonna
go for the race
we're gonna go for the race yes okay i'm
gonna erase
why not we rolled high 92.
okay he didn't fault so we'll check
see being is that first time chipset
grip juices is true huh
he was really thinking about it then he
makes a little better on the river which
actually i like jack's
queens okay good play by him
i'm gonna go for a little secret here
with the pocket deuces
and we turn into his we threw it into
his
he will never have guessed this oh my
god
now we're just going to go value down
guys just going to go value down here
with deuces
[ __ ] it and i'm going to pot the flop
with 910 here
and he calls the river isn't that great
because the 10 is not a spade but you
know
i don't think there is really much else
that we can do in this gem and hope he
doesn't have 10 extra space at 86 space
even though it's quite big portion of
his range
actually flush is quite a big portion of
his range by now
should we bet maybe small
no i'm just gonna still jam but
he calls me off with a flush i would not
be surprised
that's why you bet the deuces do you
have the chance to hit the deuce
this is man they never let you dump a
flush
as you can see guys my strategy is
really based around trying to flop
things
trying to flop something and then
getting the money in
that's usually i think a good strategy
oh good turn
kind of a free roll turn if he checks i
think he's gonna check on me with quite
a lot of aces
and then we kind of get some money in
for free
who is this guy of course
and if he check raises i'm so dead
i cannot really go bigger i think than
half pot i think this is the side that
he's going to call me with an ace
and that's about it fee check races oh
that would be so nasty
i have like the worst hand ever
who is this guy see a wreck me versus a
wish i cannot
you kind of look for the the
the three pairs the trips
so indeed like the ace tents you're
looking for
the the eight acts but then again i do
think he plays any boat as well you're
amazed we're also looking for the ace
kings
as bluffs as we already have the
asic clubs normally like asic clubs jack
or something would be an interesting ant
for him to bluff with
but yeah since we have the nut that's
why i said i would i would have actually
maybe prefer to have lower flush
and here i'm gonna go for a little raise
am i yes i am here bomb
16 and a half because i have a set
and i want the money in
again very solid strategy guys flop a
hand and try to get the money in
and we're going to play another hands
against chips and crips we've been
winning man and we're about 3-0 or
something
i'm gonna bet this hands we didn't flop
anything that is
a that is a pity
pots tips and crips my crazy guy
that's nothing oh he's gonna ship it in
what do you have man
ace king gg zero percent
zero percent that's how they get their
money in zero percent
zero percent are you planning on playing
5k now on gg this year yes i'm
definitely planning
i'm playing 5k now on gg we are back
we are back i also needed to drink some
water
if you're getting thirsty it's already
too late your brain is no longer
performing at the same level
related here first so what do we got the
gto diet aaron carmichael approved
got some what is this protein pancakes
from the wifey thank you
we gotta sell some yogurt with some
blueberries and some
vanilla some nuts so this should get us
through the session right
this should get us through the session
ace queen ace queen
got some ace queen action
all the three bats i'm gonna go for a
checker race
check raisy check razy
and i actually checked back the jack
seven
gonna face a block on a turn easy call
and if it blocks again we have easy go
again
here i think i'm blocking the
turn
let me think
yes i face a half pot here on the river
any bed worse
pretty
i always call i don't know why do i even
think guys
and this one
just probably gonna get it in even
though i'm not very happy about
because he it have 10 excess spates
aggression
ha there's one lower than me my friend
people think
yes
let me think
yeah i think both hands were misplayed
the jackson misplayed their skin was
misplayed
not a happy life okay we have to refocus
guys maybe i should sit down
i use this tennis better leave me alone
we call four bet and we have a skin
a skin a skin
do i have a raising range here
it could be but not gonna do it
he checks i think i don't really gonna
do much betting here on the turn
and here with ace 10 i check colt i'm
probably not going anywhere
checks to me in the river again now i
basically probably played
jam or check and if a case king is the
easy gem
um
and he has a screen they keep having the
lower kicker they keep having the lower
kicker
and in the meanwhile i'm not just going
to donate it and off again here on this
board
blocking the queen 10 suited so the 10
of heart is reasonable the ace is
reasonable
yes i mean i don't really see how i can
fold this hand
he has ace queen okay gg
oh three bet on three bets
come on guys it's [ __ ] great i'm
ready [ __ ] rock and roll
i'm ready to [ __ ] rock a roll here
bomb quick format let's go let's go
quick four bet
wanted to do it as fast as possible
oh yes baby get your dog
out guys pajamas
yes yes yes what you're gonna do again
with that man
okay okay okay he's gonna go for the
four beds when i have to fight for suit
not the smartest of ideas ass i'm not
falling
flop quite decent i'm actually gonna bet
am i gonna lead out on this flop
i'm gonna lead out guys why not
he raises
yeah yeah
am i gonna call
i think he could get it in here with ace
king without a spade
and we have equity when called so
let's go for it
let's go come on come on yes
yes if we flop like this we're obviously
never folding
then the question is kind of like okay
what do we
how do we want to get our money in
i don't think he's gonna see that this
board like quite a high frequency i'm
gonna call quite
tight here big blind verse cut off
so i thought that he was going to check
back quite some of his bluffs
um if you raise basically i can i could
also consider just calling
but like i said like we have so much
equity versus his value range pace 9
let's do something funky let's do
something funky
let's do something funky
mm-hmm
[Music]
don't want to go too big without a 9 or
10 in my hand
i think this sizing makes sense
and i'm actually gonna yeah he folded
ha you see why you just do something
funky
sometimes you gotta just make something
happen out of not out of nothing
and he has been paying attention to my
stream man like so far my strategy is
really around making good hands and then
uh
like well a little bit better than my
opponent and then you know
getting the money in that's my strategy
revenge he flopped top set with tents
now i flopped upset with tents
man we are healing sets oh my god
i do see a future possible bad run out
i'm going to check raise this one
now she's going to check home
i think he's going to barrow probably
again with jack's queens at a decent
frequency i don't think we lose a lot of
value
and in general king eye boards are not
really boards that you're gonna be check
raising a lot
on the river it's quite close
what i want to do i think i'm going to
check again
but these traps have been not working so
far but i think check raising here is
the
is the best strategy with exactly tents
blocking all the hands that are gonna
call and i think jackson queens are not
gonna
race all that often but could call a
check race
people checking out man
a7 you just gotta have to take a hand
and go with it sip you know
elia lazarus style you know
interesting flop
i have all the backup equity in the
world
then i flop
[Music]
yes let's go for a little race here
the jack of spades the jack of hearts
if he has a better hand again just like
with the 5'4
gg ace queen of hearts skeleton good
pets

principle that's some wisdom right there
