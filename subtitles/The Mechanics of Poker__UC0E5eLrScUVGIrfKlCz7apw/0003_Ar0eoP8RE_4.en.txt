maybe later late oh you're
you're faithful
run a cool man is indeed a cool man look
at that haircut and that beard and that
jacket he's rocking it all
viking chic
thank you guys for this lovely
introduction
this is indeed who i am and we've got a
lot of questions about that
who the hell is this guy nice video but
you know what's up
and i'm here to today to tell you guys a
little bit of
my story how i basically went from
playing free wills to playing high
stakes poker to coaching
some very good players to now coaching
the world
so actually started playing free roles
on everest poker
for you other old school poke players
out there the shasta tables
basically you could win if i'm not
mistaking like
50 cents or something and then when you
had that you were trying you would try
your luck
on the once and two cent tables and when
that didn't work out you were back to
the shusters again
um and did this various times never
really
gotten my role that way and then i
actually figured out a couple things
about like 50
for free actions and that's kind of when
i started to take it a little bit more
serious started to try and build out
this 50
dollar roll to something that i could
actually play with
remember run that up a couple times so
like 1k 1k
then i would cash out spend it instead
of you know saving it in the bankroll
would go on holiday or i don't know buy
some nice clothes or whatever
i was interested in at that moment so it
wasn't very sustainable
um and then actually i remember like
normally when summer would come you know
you would try to get a summer job and
then at some point i was like you know
what
why don't i just spend all that time
playing online poker and see if i can
actually
you know not having to get a summer job
anymore so i did that
went well um managed to spend that again
on holiday as well
so it was it was mainly building up a
little bit and spending it
in the meanwhile i was still studying i
was doing an internship i was doing
i was being a web designer and actually
i was playing some poker
on the side uh at my work hi xbox
um and i started to actually realize
that wait
like i'm actually studying for something
and actually waking
making way more money playing this i was
playing like some hats up cash
in between my work and now you know i
was running
probably rolling hot at the time because
i remember i was just winning buy-ins
buying some 100
l and i was like wait wait i mean
winning hundreds hundreds hundreds of
dollars here
why do i even work so actually i
did actually enroll into another study a
little bit of pressure here from the
parents
uh and in the meanwhile i was playing
poker on the side so i didn't have a job
and then this time i was actually trying
to build myself a role
mainly playing cash games haunted nl 200
i remember it was also full ring back at
that time
would also play like some multi-table
sitting goes back still
at the food build area you know you're a
little bit of
around started to grow my role until i
think
i was two years into my studies and
actually i got a
i was i was actually already in touch
with a couple of other dutch players and
they were actually planning on moving to
malta
uh to play online poker which obviously
sounds way more interesting than
studying
so i decided to move to malta and
try out this being a poker professional
thing
uh i moved into a house with some guys
who you
some players you guys probably know
scarface.vot was one of them
f my life all retired poker players
and another guy who's a bit less known
leonard
and basically this was when i kind of
started my
professional career but then it actually
started to become more interesting
as basically we were just playing poker
all the time and fifa that was
something that was uh played quite a lot
at our house as well
fifa for side that's quite a lot of fun
but
it was basically a lot of poker you were
in the house a lot everything was about
poker and actually and that was actually
the first time where i started to notice
like a little bit of tilt mental game
issues because i wasn't just anymore
playing when i felt like it or when i
had time
besides my studies but it was kind of
more like okay what we're gonna do now
yeah play in the morning what we're
gonna do play
afternoon play so i actually kind of i
think i was playing a lot and the
balance was quite off
obviously also all my non-poker friends
were still in holland
so i definitely had to get used to that
a little bit and
i noticed it because that was i think
the first time i went broke
not long after i was basically on tilt
trying to play much hands basically i
had no clue
how to be a professional poker player uh
and basically the rest of us also
didn't but especially f my life back in
the time already was playing quite high
stakes and we were basically just
talking about
how to play poker which i knew how to do
but all the things around playing poker
and being a broker professional that was
very new to me and to everyone we didn't
really have an example it was just like
yeah
you know you sit down and you start
playing we didn't really think about it
in a
in a in a more advanced way than that
and that was actually also the first
time that i went broke
um i did get a stake straight away and
remember after the steak it was going
quite well actually way too well it was
basically from what i remember i was
running very bad
but also playing bad and tilting quite
hard
and straight away when i started the
steak i was doing very well
and i went on an insane heater and i had
no clue at that moment what is an
expected what were my expected winnings
per month what a win rate was
what kind of win rates were normal we
had no clue back in the time so i was
just like okay yeah well you know
this is the new reality now i'm a
professional poker player i'm gonna make
20k a month no problem uh and that that
heater definitely
[ __ ] me up in a way because i was
getting quite lazy
you know you know everyone knows this
kind of sessions where you just sit down
you win a lot of money and you're like
okay
this is the new reality now it's a nice
thing to try
and believe which obviously wasn't the
case
so it was doing a little bit better but
obviously heaters
he just kind of end
[Music]
remember actually we went to vegas
first time vegas for the people who have
never been definitely something that you
have to experience about first time
vegas
one house with a bunch of guys a lot of
parties getting robbed by strippers too
much alcohol
obviously all kind of factors that don't
really improve your poker game
let alone bankroll management i remember
i sat down at
we were playing a 10 25 50 game
and i mean i was playing mainly like mid
stakes online
and i was already broke it wasn't even
my role and i remember we were sitting
with
i was sitting with basically my raw at
the table which was maybe
8k or something and i swapped i swapped
8k with scarface.vot
and i remember him losing a pot still
remember it he topped
he flopped top pair top kicker and queen
i bought the guy check raised and
barreled off
obviously had a set uh and there i saw
like half of my role go away
it was even out of my control but i
remember back in the time it didn't
really
it didn't really care to me uh i was
kind of living in like
denial you could say i don't know it
didn't really hurt me as much
it was like i was quite hyped as well a
lot of people were
saying i was a very good poker player
and i kind of just went with that it's
like okay yeah in the long term it will
it will be all right but obviously
financially it wasn't going that well
so you could say that time looking back
at that time i was very
irresponsible but it was a lot of fun
and i mean what can i do i was like 22
i have to say new school poker players
who now roll into poker and they are
that eight star way more professional
than we were back in the day i don't
know
anyone of my age 10 years ago that took
the game
as professionals some guys who are 23
now would
i guess it's just the fact that it's way
harder nowadays
to win a lot of money at poker compared
to back then
but obviously my situation still wasn't
that good
i remember after vegas i went back to
malta
uh yeah and
there was just like there was no
awareness of the fact that there was a
range of
a and c game in poker that like if you
don't sleep well that the next day you
don't play as well
if you don't eat well that will also
have an influence on how you will play
how you prepare etc i remember i was
just laying on the couch
and playing on my laptop for example
these are obviously factors that
will not contribute to a great poker
session but i had no awareness back then
so it was quite
frustrating because like wait i'm am i a
good poke player i'm another good poke
player yeah i used to be winning a lot
in my little upswing
and now i'm not winning what's going on
still
in that current situation and actually i
think i was back in holland back at that
time a lot of
my a couple of my friends who i was in
malta with
uh they were planning on going to brazil
and i mean if you're in holland in the
winter and it's dark
and brazil sounds quite attractive so i
actually went to brazil
with kind of the same guys again again a
very irresponsible decision maybe i had
like
10k on my poker account and that wasn't
even mine
so it's not really a smart situation to
go to rio de janeiro
uh in the epic of new year
carnival all this kind of stuff because
it can get quite costly and if you have
no money that's not a lot of fun
but obviously i didn't really think
about it that way i was irresponsible
and
went anyway
not well planned i remember when we
arrived there no apartment
found the apartment internet city you
know
not the way that i would currently
travel if i would play poker
okay definitely again a lot of
unawareness of how it worked
and brazil obviously quite a distracting
place
if you like latin american women which
i'm definitely fan of myself
actually married one but i'm going ahead
of myself here
and in general i remember that period
was a lot of fun
but it didn't necessarily help my poker
career it did help my love life
and i did gain a lot of experience made
a lot of friends
um but i remember actually now the fact
that i was being basically a broke
and in-depth poker player did start to
have its effect especially on like
stress levels
and especially when you hang out with
players who are way more successful than
you
financially i remember i was hanging out
with a couple guys who were quite good
at
their game and they were making way more
money than i did and then when it was
carnival and parties you know you would
just go along even though you didn't
have the money
not very smart and very stressful at
times
so i guess the joy that i experienced
was getting less and less and the stress
that i was experiencing
was growing i would actually end up
going to vegas again
[Music]
this time i thought i was gonna approach
it a little bit smarter which i did
definitely a bit less partying no strip
clubs or at least
less strip clubs as my girlfriend was
there as well
and i remember actually poker
i went actually on a live poker stake
playing like some high stakes
didn't go as well unfortunately actually
it went quite badly
and i remember at the end of that trip
i mean vegas again if you're in vegas
and you have no money i wouldn't
recommend it
it's quite stressful everywhere you turn
your ass you have to spend money
so the stress definitely started to
build up for me personally i remember
back then i i got like a letter from a
friend of mine that in holland i still
had a bill open
of like 1k or something uh i remember
that was actually quite a breakdown
moment for me where
basically the financial stress um
kind of got to me and it's a it's kind
of annoying situation
because i felt like i had no control
over my expenses i was just getting
sucked into it because i was going with
the group that i was going
um and i was just kind of getting sucked
into it and i felt like i had no control
over my expenses
so after vegas actually i moved i flew
back to holland
brought my girlfriend and
i was actually spending some time with
my parents just you know
controlling my expenses a little bit she
had to go back to brazil so we spent
some time apart
and then actually moved to malta again
where i really started to
to kind of find a routine and i started
to kind of discover myself like hey if i
eat certain things after that i'm less
concentrated hey
if i sleep better i'm more concentrated
hey if i prepare well i actually play
better
hey if i stick to my hours or like hey
this time of the day i'm way more sharp
and actually started to do quite well um
as i started to kind of learn more about
myself i would say i think that was kind
of the discovery that i had
and which was quite a big breakthrough
for me because as i said
i was quite hyped always from players
around me
i was actually given quite a lot of
interesting poker advice poker strategy
advice to some players
who were friends of mine who were doing
way better than me and that was quite
frustrating obviously if you don't
really have the success that you want
and you
actually give good advice to other
players strategically
and that's actually when i kind of
started to realize like that there was a
big gap between my off-game knowledge
and my in-game knowledge
due to various factors and obviously in
general if you have a lot of financial
stress
that's not really helping your poker
performance so that was something that i
had to start handling
[Music]
and then i actually moved back to brazil
again
this time without the poker buddies but
to visit my current wife indeed i
arrived there we got married i think
a half year later
and that was actually you know i was
just settling down we had
our own place i finally felt like i had
some control
over my expenses i had some control over
my grind routines
i had good recovery because my life
wasn't about poker anymore i wasn't
living anymore with poker players
um so i would play i would study
afterwards spend time with the wife with
friends
who are all outside of poker and i think
that balance really
worked well for me and i was slowly
getting into
a better situation i remember also i
started to work a lot with jared tendler
because i mean in general if you have a
lot of financial stress
and i've had a lot of experience it's
good to talk
with a mental game coach or with a
psychologist or
um there were there were just many
factors that i noticed would influence
my game especially like i said my
my gap between off game and in-game
knowledge was just way too big and i
was really curious to figure out how
that worked so i actually lived there
i lived there i think in total for three
to four years
mainly playing mid stakes playing higher
stakes like 1k
2k plus i lost quite a lot of money and
so i
remember i got quite risk-averse as well
i had some responsibilities now
i was taking care of my wife while she
was studying so i had expenses and i was
on a stake which all
don't really help and i was risk-averse
i was mainly grinding mid stakes let's
say 400 now 600 nil
but managed to grind everything back
managed to pay
the staker off so i was out of markup
again
do remember every time and this is kind
of the
ongoing thing every time when i got off
a stake i would immediately feel like
certain financial pressure coming back
again
so i think actually through my career i
played a lot of stakes which
has a very big compound effect like i
remember if i would have made better
decisions in the beginning especially
the first or second time that i went
broke
basically if you don't have to grind it
back but with money of someone else you
always have to pay
a part of your winnings and that has a
very big combat effect so
i hope for some starting poke players
who might be seeing this i think it's
very important that you're responsible
with
your money learned that from me because
i wasn't
but in general those three to four years
in brazil were a very good time for me
for my career i was doing quite well i
started to get
more into self-development i remember
reading the book the miracle morning
definitely a good book if you are not
yet into self-development but basically
it said that
you should have a sort of routine in in
this case in the morning
that would help you set up for yeah good
performance during the day
so i started to do this kind of things
like meditating reading other self-help
books
reading about performance and actually
started to apply a lot of these factors
into poker
[Music]
but then at some point brazil came to uh
and me
and my brazilian wife we were moving
back to europe spent a little bit of
time in malta and
before moving back to holland and i
think that was
2015 if i'm not mistaking
where i actually had one of my worst
years
i made i think like 20k that year
purely at the tables luckily back in
that time you still had great back
um so you know in the end i definitely
made
more than 20k but still when i saw that
my table profits were only 20k
there was definitely a wake-up call for
me like okay i have to start changing
things up
i wasn't really actively studying and
having new inputs anymore
so i think that was definitely a point
was like okay i should probably
change a couple of things up basically i
was just getting
too comfortable in my current situation
and also financially i was doing well
but i was never really progressing
due to expenses due to the stake due to
uh yeah not not having the success due
to still being risk averse i would just
keep on grinding on mid 6 i wasn't
really looking to move up so i was
mainly looking
using poker for a way to pay for life
and actually i remember
with a bad year i was close to going
broke again maybe i had like what
10k left or something in my account
which obviously from mid 6 isn't that
much
so actually decided to put that tank
aside and join another stake
why not and that was actually i think
because i still noticed every time when
i got on the stake that
it really would release some financial
pressure for me
which would make me perform way better
so
i thought it was worth it you know the
kind of peace of mind that a steak would
give me
i'm not gonna offer staking now to
people you know this is not a
this is not some kind of sales stuff
next i remember as well that was a again
a very
bad time because i was kind of moving
back to holland
and you know if you're if you're living
abroad
traveling traveling the world in your
online poker player people kind of get
quite a romantic view of your situation
and i think a lot of people
thought i was way more successful than i
actually wasn't me i'm not really the
type to
to to start bragging or to pretend to be
something that i'm not
but people did were projecting like okay
yeah the guy lives in brazil plays on
the poker he must do very well you know
must be like
must be like a millionaire and uh that
okay
it's it's was quite weird but that kind
of external pressure
yeah i think that that kind of external
pressure of having to
live up to a certain picture that other
people might have of me
remember it was also quite stressful
back at the time
but i got on uh i got on the newstake
and that's actually also he that he
definitely told me okay renee i was
playing 500
zoom back at the time uh with not
the greatest win rate ever maybe i was
winning like one or two bbs
uh back then which obviously with rake
back it was
still fine but he was way more of the
list and you should play on multiple
sides find better games
to actually start that's actually when i
started to
be become a little bit better in my soft
skills
so basically finding better games
multi-siting learning to handle
uh yeah because it's quite a hustle you
know you have to
manage lobbies play playing games
actually started
to prepare way better for sessions
started to work a little bit with
elliot's row
with like some visualization priming
meditation which really helped me
personally as well
and then actually i think this was also
around the same time that solvers kind
of came out so
i also started to have a new a new place
where i could get theoretical input
and that's actually when it all started
coming to come together
i remember moving to holland
[Music]
and this is kind of where the first
steps of poker ambition started
i was starting an office with three
other poker players
of which one of them had the poker
ambition
brand or registered as a company and
that was kind of the company which which
we hired the office so we kind of that
was
kind of the start of poker ambition and
basically i was teaming up with uh
explode and poker kluka was kind of the
main team
and i remember actually back then
especially from
explodes situation he kind of
was in there and he was like hey yeah
we're gonna become the best
and as a like i always use poker just as
a means
you know to live i had to make money to
live uh
but he was like no no no no no we're
here to become the best
and that's like i guess like that was
kind of the final
piece of the puzzle to actually set a
goal that was higher than just grinding
mid-sticks and paying my bills
and i said okay becoming the best and in
the beginning i was like
you know this guy let him talk uh
i would just you know do my own things
but you know we started to get a bit
used to the idea people were motivated
in the team like okay guys
you know let's try to become the best so
i started to get a little bit used to
the idea of okay
so then if we want to become the best
what should we do
so we upped our level of strategy we're
becoming way more efficient with
strategy i think also back in the time
like my theoretical knowledge was
getting way better
i was already quite good at from an
exploitive point of view but i didn't
really understand the theory behind it
so i started to become better in poker
in general so yeah what does someone who
is trying to become one of the best in
the world does on a daily basis that was
a question that i started to ask myself
uh and then basically anything that
could increase our performance we
started trying
um like i said i think i already
mentioned working with
elliot rowe working with jared tandler
finding other
performance coaches fixing my diet
exercising basically routine you know i
was very strict playing from like
eight nine in the morning to five to six
in the night
having a structured routine check and
it was basically just trying to do all
these kind of things to
yeah basically to become one of the best
poker players in the world that was kind
of the goal
and a team really helps i remember
actually there was a i think elliot rowe
used this quote that he said that
um high six players don't hang out with
each other because they're high-stakes
players no they are high-sex players
because they hang out with each other
and this is something i think that's
very important you have to find the
right group that can lift you to another
level
and the belief in our group was
definitely there i mean
the two players i just mentioned had had
or are having their fair share of
success in poker
and it kind of came all together i kind
of visualized where this was going
and i just started to execute and then i
remember
over those next years i was playing
mainly 2k to 10k
played against some of the best in the
world the lioness loves the otb barons
maybe not always the smartest decision
i mean looking at at my peak how good
was i don't think i was the best in the
world
and obviously this kind of also depends
on your definition of being the best or
the definition of success
how do you measure that for example
who would you battle who wouldn't you
battle or it wasn't just purely how much
money you wanted the tables
for example you might have a very good
and tough player to play against but his
game selection is quite [ __ ] he keeps
playing against the lions and o2b
uh yeah then he's not gonna make a lot
of money even though he's quite a good
poker player but he's not a great poker
professional
then i think i think at my peak there
was maybe like five guys
who i wouldn't really want to be playing
three four-handed
uh obviously this is in the time zone
that i was playing for example because i
was quite strict in my hourly
could be that there were guys playing in
the night that i've never ever played
against
because they were also quite strict in
their timeline so i can only basically
speak for the players who were online
when i was online uh you know the
linuses the otbs
the big blind bats those were guys that
i was trying to avoid
but basically for the rest i would i
think play most of the people
so yeah i guess i saw myself at my peak
as number four or five in that regard
and then basically when you spent all
your career
first just trying to get out of makeup
and then we were finally out of makeup
try to pay your bills and then we at
some point had to believe
or had someone to tell you hey you could
actually become the best
to them try to make that happen then
when i finally arrived there
or at least you know i had the success
that i
wanted i was kind of like okay now what
is the next challenge and that's kind of
when
poker ambition more towards the public
started
i think at that match we had like 18
students coming over
live we had rented an extra office and
turned it into like a little classroom
where we started to teach poker i think
the average stake that was there was
probably
they were playing i think between 50 to
200 l
we still have a bunch of students
they're mainly playing i think now
a lot of them reached like 1k which i'm
very proud of
and they did a great job so shout out to
the poker ambition students
and basically that's what i've been
spending the last two years on really
trying to see how do you turn a group of
poker players
into successful poker players um
or at least more successful poker
players because some were already
successful
and i'm not i'm kind of a guy who
doesn't really like to combine things i
kind of go into some
when i choose something so i basically
put my own poker career on hold for a
little bit and focus
only on that and basically you could say
i went to
into the lab for like two years trying
to understand how poker worked in a
better way
and then trying to understand how to
teach them
and then trying to understand why
certain players succeed and why certain
players don't
and then for the last six months i kind
of started to gather all the knowledge
and reflect on what we have learned
over my own poker career coaching the
students
and obviously everything that goes
around interesting for me to learn all
that stuff as well
and in general i like one of my values
is that
i want to have growth so i'm always
looking for that next thing that will
give me the biggest opportunity
for growth and the last six months i've
been mainly focusing on turning
all my knowledge that i have into
what i would call like basically the
ultimate poker
course slash community that will be
available for you guys to join
very soon and we have some other
projects coming up as well
in 2021 i'm very excited about that
we're working
hard on behind the scenes
and as for my own poker career i do
actually plan on playing a little bit
more poker in the future
all that studying coaching and working
together with the team and seeing that
success has gotten me quite excited
about playing again
i'd see a new opportunity for growth
down that path
and i'm actually planning on taking you
guys along for the ride in my comeback
you could say
uh the youtube videos that we just
released were an example of that
i think actually that was one of the
first session i played in quite a long
time so
if you liked that that was probably my d
game i would say
but not only on youtube and instagram i
also plan to do
twitch so make sure to follow
me there i'll mainly be playing some 500
no zoom in the beginning as i think it's
a great pool
to warm up my game and as it has a good
variety of players to play against the
pool is always different
and i think that is about it for my
poker story
