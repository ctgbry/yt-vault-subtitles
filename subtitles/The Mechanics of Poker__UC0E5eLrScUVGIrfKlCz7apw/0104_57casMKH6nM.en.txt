what's up guys it's adam karma here and
i'm the mindset and performance coach
for poker ambition over the past few
months myself and renee have been
working hard to provide you guys with
the best content and coaching
experiences to turn you into the best
poker players you can be rene will

[00:16]
poker players you can be rene will
continue to provide you with expert
strategy and technical knowledge and i'm
going to start producing more mindsets
and performance content for you guys to
help you to level up so if you do enjoy
this type of video make sure you smash
that like button before you go so you
know to bring you more valuable content

[00:30]
know to bring you more valuable content
like this with that being said let's
dive into today's video in today's video
you're going to learn why solvers are
killing your poker profits a bit of a
strong claim i know but by the end of
this video you'll understand exactly why
most players misuse solvers and as a

[00:46]
most players misuse solvers and as a
result they don't learn or retain
information as well as they could and
also at the end i'm gonna give you three
things that you can do to maximize your
learning and use the solvers in that
model all right so make sure you stick
around to the ends for those so

[01:01]
around to the ends for those so
back in 2016 maybe slightly before 2016
there was no such thing as solvers all
right so poker players had to do a lot
more thinking all right support players
would generally hypothesize they'd write
down strategies they'd try to come up

[01:15]
down strategies they'd try to come up
with ideas that would exploit the
players they were up against all right
so these are a lot of thinking and they
talk a lot more talking between players
in terms of what strategy to use which
got the brain very engaged all right so
there's a big learning process involved
however

[01:30]
however
before solvers players didn't really
know what their optimal strategy was
they didn't know what gto looked like
they didn't know what they were striving
for it's like having a test but never
knowing the answers at the end all right
so as much as you're trying to optimize
you never know what the answer is all

[01:45]
you never know what the answer is all
right so then
come 2016 or around that time
solvers come out and it was just like
boom boom boom boom boom boom oh my god
we've got all the answers it's like
taking a maths quiz then realizing wait
all the answers are on the back page so

[02:00]
all the answers are on the back page so
you skip to the back page you're like oh
this is so much easier all right so uh
over the last five years or so there's
been a massive learning curve a massive
growth curve in people's knowledge
because they're now able to know what
optimal strategy looks like so we think
oh well good solvers have helped

[02:15]
oh well good solvers have helped
everyone become amazing poker players
and help them to learn and retain that
information but actually that's not the
case or it's not the full story all
right so in today's video i'm not going
to talk about whether you should be
using
a gto strategy and using solve as i'm
following them or whether you should be

[02:30]
following them or whether you should be
using an exploitation strategy and
exploiting your player pool all right
we're not going to dive into the
exploitation versus gto
debate but today i'm going to talk about
the mind and the brain's ability to do
two things all right as a product player
and you're using solvers

[02:46]
and you're using solvers
surely there's only two things you care
about all right and those are learning
so learning knowledge strategies how to
play and retaining that information
memory stability to learn and the
ability to remember all right so when

[03:00]
ability to remember all right so when
you're using the solver you're generally
running a sim runners run the spot
and you want to know how to play that
spot and remember how to play that spot
so that you can apply it into your game
all right if you use the solvers for any
other reason than that please let me
know in the comments and you should
maybe start thinking about uh what

[03:16]
maybe start thinking about uh what
you're using them for all right but
you're basically using solvers as a way
to know answers to problems pogba
problems so we can play better poker all
right so
in essence it's an amazing thing all
right so we let's say we have a hand and

[03:31]
right so we let's say we have a hand and
we're unsure of how we played it and
then at the end of the hand we can
basically stop our session
run a solver and then get the answer to
that spot i should have done this i
should have done that all right now i'm
gonna i'm gonna go on with some real
life examples first and then come back

[03:45]
life examples first and then come back
to the poker examples but i'm going to
show you why that is ineffective for
learning all right while using a solver
to tell you the answer is ineffective
for learning all right so first of all
imagine you're in a maths class all
right and you're starting to learn
algebra all right let's say you learn

[04:01]
algebra all right let's say you learn
the basis of algebra 3x plus 2y equals
6x or something like that all right and
at first you don't really know what
you're doing all right so imagine the
teacher tells you the basic concepts
okay this is what this is what we're
trying to do here and then they give you

[04:16]
trying to do here and then they give you
10 minutes to think about how to solve
the problem all right so you then spend
10 minutes trying to think about it
you're really getting the brain engaged
what's the answer how do i solve this
problem the teacher then says after 10
minutes explain to your friend or

[04:30]
minutes explain to your friend or
someone next to you how you came up with
those solutions all right so you went
for a process trying to solve the
problem and now you're trying to explain
why you did it so you know what i think
you do this i think you do that all
right now so 15 minutes have passed by
now
and now the teacher is going to go up

[04:45]
and now the teacher is going to go up
okay are you guys ready for the answer
what's going to happen when you get the
answer all right so
now teacher gives you the answer two
things happen either you are right and
you validate yourself and go yes i got
it right and your mind goes boom boom
boom like i was like don't mean hit well

[05:01]
boom like i was like don't mean hit well
done you got it right or you got it
wrong now the good thing is when you get
it wrong the brain still because you
spend this time in advance trying to
prep yourself the brain starts going
well why did i get it wrong what can i
do different all right so you there's

[05:16]
do different all right so you there's
two things it remembers the answer the
actual numeric answer in this case in
your case is it'll be the solver's
answer and it also
looks for ways if it was wrong how can i
improve what can i learn from this why
did i get it wrong all right on the flip

[05:31]
did i get it wrong all right on the flip
side imagine the teacher i just said
okay this is the this is the um the
equation three x plus two y and in the
next five seconds put your answer in
let's go like that and go okay here is
the answer now when they give you the
answer very quickly like that you don't

[05:46]
answer very quickly like that you don't
remember it because your brain wasn't
engaged in the process even though you
got it right you're like don't really
notify it but if you get it wrong you
don't your brain doesn't ask why all
right so let's bring it from the maths
classroom into the into the portrait

[06:00]
classroom into the into the portrait
tables all right and you're trying to
figure out strategies on the fly now you
play a high in the pocket
and at the end of your session you're
gonna you run that high for the solver
now what a lot of players do is they get
very lazy in this process and just go ah

[06:15]
very lazy in this process and just go ah
the solver will tell me the answer all
right so although you think you're being
curious by running a simulation for a
solver
your brain is not engaged in the process
if anything it's disengaged because like
ah i don't even think about the spot
solver do it i don't even oh this is a

[06:31]
solver do it i don't even oh this is a
close spot i wonder what i should do
here imagine it's a close spot i wonder
what i should do here
back in the day of pre-solvers players
will spend a lot of time on those spots
all right what should i do here this is
really close let me think about it and
then they spend time debating this
writing stuff down trying to understand

[06:45]
writing stuff down trying to understand
it whereas now you go well that's it to
solve it is oh it's all about bets there
okay cool must be a bet and you quickly
go from the problem to the answer
like that depends on your computer is
running the same but it's a quick
process the problem is your brain is not

[07:01]
process the problem is your brain is not
engaged all right so
what do we need to do how do we solve
this problem all right because obviously
solves been a great aid to the game
overall they've helped the learning
curve improve a lot the standards
definitely improved post alba's but how
can we have the best of both worlds how

[07:15]
can we have the best of both worlds how
can we engage the minds and you solve us
all right to get the actual true answers
and true gto frameworks to look at
all right so first of all we need to
engage our curiosity all right curiosity
is the key i did a video on this

[07:30]
is the key i did a video on this
recently as well talk about how
high-stakes players use curiosity more
than lots of mistakes players all right
and the reason curiosity is so powerful
is it engages the brain all right so
remember there's two things we're trying
to do when we're trying to learn poker
we're trying to use sulfurs first is to

[07:45]
we're trying to use sulfurs first is to
learn information the how all right so
the brains the chemicals of the brain
when you're curious that gets sparked
are dopamine dopamine pathways get
firing which is our ability to learn all
right so dope means that kind of the
reward slash motivation molecule that

[08:01]
reward slash motivation molecule that
gets us to seek things it gets us to
seek things but it also gets us to learn
from those things all right the things
that we're pursuing if we get rewarded
for it either positive or negative it
knows that all right so it helps us
learn when we're curious it also sparks

[08:15]
learn when we're curious it also sparks
a part of the brain called the
hippocampus as the hippocampus fires
activates when they do studies on this
and that helps with memory all right so
both the ability to learn and the
ability to
remember
or hinging or not hinging but it's
they're definitely compounded massively

[08:31]
they're definitely compounded massively
by our ability to be curious all right
so we've got a spark curiosity i've
actually wrote down a quote from
einstein of all people the genius
einstein he says i have no special
talents i am only passionately curious
all right if einstein is only curious

[08:46]
all right if einstein is only curious
and he's not he's not a smart guy
what
we got right so we need to be curious we
need to spark curiosity all right so
hopefully you guys are thinking all
right yeah a lot of you guys think i've
been lazy with my approach to studying i
do use solvers a little bit too much so

[09:01]
do use solvers a little bit too much so
for this guy this video will be the most
helpful for you guys who you solve as as
your cheat sheet your way to get the
answers and you almost do it quickly
easily without putting much effort in
these next three things i'm gonna tell
you will be a very big benefit to you
all right so i'm not here to say it

[09:16]
all right so i'm not here to say it
don't you solve us i'm not here to say
that you should be exploiting or
anything like that i'm here to tell you
the pitfalls of using solvers to give
you quick answers now the good news is
we can do three things when using
solvers that allow us to get magnified

[09:31]
solvers that allow us to get magnified
learning exponentially more learning all
right so through three approaches so
write these down and make sure you apply
them after you've blended them all right
so the first thing is imagine you've
played a hundred poker and you want to
run it into the solver most players just

[09:45]
run it into the solver most players just
go straight from hand to solver they
might tag loads of hands to a session
then run them at the end all right
before you do that i want you to ask a
simple question and you ask yourself
what do i expect to see from the solver

[10:00]
what do i expect to see from the solver
in scientific terms this is called
setting a hypothesis all right so when
scientists do experiments they set a
hypothesis which is what do i expect to
see what am i hoping to prove or
disprove with this experiment for
example so for you what do you expect to

[10:15]
example so for you what do you expect to
see also what do you not know already so
what they expect to say and what do you
not know you might not know if there's a
spot so you might go i don't know
what bluffs is the solver is going to
use i don't know what value has gonna
use this what question engages the brain

[10:30]
use this what question engages the brain
all right it gets you curious it starts
asking like what am i trying to see here
all right so when you get the
information
you're more likely to remember it all
right so this is this is spark and
curiosity this is magnifying your
ability to turn on the curious part of
your brain all right the chemicals in

[10:45]
your brain all right the chemicals in
your brain don't mean a fire and your
hippocampus for memory will also fire
just by asking these questions learning
is an active process not a passive
process it reminds me once when i was
playing a regular and i was heads of
batman with him and i had a spot to run

[11:00]
batman with him and i had a spot to run
for a solver and i remember being pretty
confident how to play the spot i was
like oh yeah i'm expecting to see this
but i got the habit of writing down what
i was expecting to see and i wrote down
a few bullet points two or three things
that i expected to see and i was pretty
confident i was actually just checking
just to give myself a pat on the back of

[11:15]
just to give myself a pat on the back of
my strategy i'm sure you guys can relate
you check in just to give yourself a bit
of validation that you are playing right
so i run this spot through the solver
and i just spat out
everything that i did not expect to see
like everything i thought was i was
gonna say i didn't see any of it and i
was like

[11:30]
was like
whoa holy [ __ ] now because i draw those
questions down because i was i was
priming myself to what i was about to
see my i almost got like a jolt of like
[ __ ]
what the hell is this and my mind got
very very curious
how if i messed this spot up so badly
all right how i messed up so badly if i

[11:46]
all right how i messed up so badly if i
didn't write down what i expect to look
for my mind might have been like oh this
is weird right interesting not sure
about this but because it was so
different from what i expected i then
started going
well which other spots am i completely
misplaying which other spots are similar

[12:00]
misplaying which other spots are similar
to this when my my frame of logic is so
far off and rather than like judging
myself and get a night about it i went
on a rabbit hole for an hour just
assessing the spot she's going how how
have i misjudged it what am i not
understanding all right which then leads
me into the next question you guys need
to ask so if you've asked the what

[12:16]
to ask so if you've asked the what
ask why the solved idea is what it is
all right why does the solver use these
bluff combinations why is the solver
better this frequency why is this all if
i use these hands for these big bets
these ones for small bits really think
about it all right and actually write

[12:31]
about it all right and actually write
down in your own words why you think it
is what it is this is a huge one right
especially if if if the solver validates
what you do you can almost skip this
step a little bit but also but still
write things down which like double down
on like your theory was right but if you

[12:46]
on like your theory was right but if you
get it wrong if you're off the mark or
if you don't understand certain parts
even if you don't answer that
hypothesize why would it do this all
right and this again this is the solve i
can't tell you why it does what it is
unless there's some advanced solvers i
don't know about you can't go into the
solve and go tell me why you were using

[13:01]
solve and go tell me why you were using
these things you've got to use your mind
you've got to engage the brain get
curious about why the solvers do what it
does all right so when it doesn't give
you the answers you want or it's
something that you didn't know
write it down why
ask yourself why you're doing this and
try to hypothesize that gets the brain

[13:16]
try to hypothesize that gets the brain
curious gets to thinking it gets you
engaged in the process and the final
step is to ask yourself how you can
apply this into your own game how can
you apply what you've learned into the
games you're playing
also you could say when you're going to
use it like what spots are you going to

[13:31]
use it like what spots are you going to
use this to this kind of the same
question how can you use it for you in
your games right now all right if you're
looking to solve a strategy and you're
playing two dollar games like oh this is
a good theory but my points do nothing
like this i'm not gonna be able to use
this in technically but i could use it

[13:46]
this in technically but i could use it
in these situations all right so how are
you going to use it all right right a
few bullet points how are you going to
use this information into your game all
right so you cover a process there
rather than you trying to go
from a hand that you play it to a solver
to memorize the solver and think it's

[14:01]
to memorize the solver and think it's
just going to install into your brain oh
i've looked at the sim therefore it's
gone in you've now done three things
that's sparked the brain to learn and
retain information first thing yourself
what you're expecting to see in advance
this gets you curious and then the brain
starts firing the right chemicals to

[14:15]
starts firing the right chemicals to
actually engage with what you're going
to see so it's like preempting what
you're going to see so when you see the
information the solver the mind is
engaged all right if you don't do the
what questions you won't be engaged with
what you see it's just numbers and
formulas and whatever all right
then you ask yourself why second

[14:30]
then you ask yourself why second
question why you've seen so now you're
digging behind the surface you're trying
to understand the mechanisms all right
the mechanics behind what you're seeing
right why does it do what it is you're
going deeper than just the service level
answer and then finally how can you
apply it how can you apply it into your

[14:45]
apply it how can you apply it into your
game all right and that's going to give
you the use cases and you actually start
using it in your game as a result and
experimenting with what you've learned
all right so what
why
how this gives you a massive massive
advantage on every other player i see
every other player there's obviously a

[15:00]
every other player there's obviously a
lot of good players and players out
there who are using these approaches
already but if you're not most players
will not be given this they'll be very
passive to be using solvers as their
kind of cheat sheet like flipping to the
end of the the maths quiz and look at
the answers and they're getting lazy

[15:15]
the answers and they're getting lazy
what they're thinking as a result it's
killing the profits they they're using
the solver as they can a second brain
and then not sparking the curiosity and
as a result they can't learn they can't
retain information they're trying to
memorize graphs formulas charts but the
brain's not engaged and the brain

[15:31]
brain's not engaged and the brain
unfortunately doesn't learn that way
learning is a very active process we
need to engage the brain in order to
learn all right guys so you guys
probably thought i was going to bash
solve as in this video i actually didn't
i talk about the kind of pros and cons
and hopefully i'll give you guys three
things to do when you are using solvers

[15:46]
things to do when you are using solvers
in order to maximize your linen all
right guys if you enjoyed this video
give me a like also drop a comment below
to let me know this was interesting to
you and was of value and there's gonna
be plenty more coming from me very soon
