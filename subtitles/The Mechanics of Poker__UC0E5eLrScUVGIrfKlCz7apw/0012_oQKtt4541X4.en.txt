holy [ __ ] no more power
are you [ __ ] kidding me i have no
power in my battery
i have no more power in my battery we
really [ __ ] up if that happens right
and and we are back
with another live stream on the twitch
streets
decided to start this one off with a
banger
i really love this tune guys i really
wanted to share it with you guys
so today another stream let me put it on
the table
so i warmed up played 10 hands
won a stack yeah that's how it goes
uh last session a couple days ago
as you recall maybe it was one of the
first sessions in 30 days in a month or
so
i played terrible looking at it in
hindsight a lot of
scenarios i was also i was in the wrong
yes
state you could say actually it's quite
interesting
elliot row i remember he's quite big on
setting the intention to actually think
and now you're going to be like think
but yeah actually setting the intention
to actually think
and think about the right things usually
in my experience when i play
bad it's just because i thought about
the wrong things
i was in the wrong state of mind i was
thinking about the wrong things
i didn't set any intentions i didn't
have any goals that it wasn't
ah as we said in earlier streams curious
interested playful
you know i was i was not myself so this
stream i'm gonna try to be a little bit
more myself
actually wrote down deep breath slow
down and think
that seems like a good good mantra
so uh yeah let's
let's get into it let's see if we can
put uh
our 200 will be at work here there it's
just yeah
you have varieties of how good someone
is i guess
um but let me try to fix this this these
these buttons
hold on one second my computer skills
i'm gonna come in let me try to
let me try to fix these buttons one
seconds hotkeys
i want to go to the scene wacko show
one f1 okay
okay this one is actually quite
interesting straight away big bet here
yeah i guess jack then i have to call
but
turn is also quite interesting
i have
what do i actually do on the turn
this was very interesting things he has
like the higher
two pairs i'm not really sure i'm gonna
check
but i could be convinced otherwise
the thing is any any board bear on the
river kind of sucks
and will definitely leave me open for
getting in trouble
i think i should probably go for a big
bet now
usually i like these four straight
boards for example
so any hand so obviously if a 10 falls
any hand wins or at least any
hint at least chops but at the same time
he has
all the sets high two pairs and a lot of
rivers will
basically give him an advantage again
i don't know how hard he's going to
you could say exploit me or not exploit
me how much pressure he's going to put
on board paris but there's obviously
quite a lot of boar bear rivers
a heart was also not very decent let me
see
because the heart the ace was not a
heart
yeah the ace was not a hearthstone ace
river i do have the jack of hearts
probably if you would check a jack 10
it's when you don't have any hearts
i guess yeah it's as soon as i have
obs selected the hotkeys work as soon as
i have obs not selected the hotkeys
don't work so if anyone has a solution
please share your solution in the
meanwhile
i think i'll use a different solution
which is
to use my
f4 f5
this would be the temporary solution so
i don't have to switch around tables
if anyone has a solution let me know
and we are limitless again guys seven do
suited
made a point with myself that that's
kind of the only the only funky hand
that we're gonna play
and we flop a deuce deuce is not a bad
hand
does he flat deuces here on the button
there is a
fun player in the big blind so i guess
our blockers are sort of relevant
i'm gonna make a small check race here
let's whack let's whack bricky boom
limitless man that guy knows something
that we don't i just show them drunken
style and i think it's good for poker
i'm on phone that really sucks
but some say four tables is great or at
least it's a fourth table view for your
note 4 tabling
as explained you know when you when you
pass your 30s
mass multi-tabling
and talking to people in twitch and
answering questions
it's
it's a bit too much for or a
semi-retired poker player like me who
doesn't
play six hours a day so who actually has
to think about most of his decisions
this is overrange fine 10 7 it's a bit
loose
i'm just gonna fault
the ninth i'm gonna dunk out he opened
on the smaller side so i think this
board is quite good for me
or that i'm gonna be doing a lot of
dunking on this board in general is not
that good for me but
we're playing against a fun player so
i'll just start off with a bat
turn is brings a flush
which
again i think is better i think i defend
more suited hands
than he opens with here i got raised
with the sevens
and i'm just going to start firing big i
think
on the turn
it was actually an intention from an
earlier session
where versus fun players we're not
really going to look too
they're not going to really look too
slow play strong hands
actually i'm going to go for the triple
block here
it could be a but i think nines is like
probably the perfect hand to do this
with
i got raised
and i think ninth
would he raise nines don't think so
right
i think we can call with nines
king ten here with the ace
nine
it's time to start making some big over
bets
i think he's definitely connecting
sometimes with the ace
there's a lot of hands to get value from
at this point versus a fun player
so i don't mind going a little bit
bigger
and also don't mind getting it in i
think he can have ace eight
a6 and on the river i think i'm just
gonna go for maximum
and hope
he has an ace
another straight
going to go eat best of luck thank you
very much mr bricky t
how the poo is you play or don't play i
think that's probably the correct way to
go
first of all player jack 9 off
all right fun players usually are a
little bit looser is that actually good
for jack nine off
here with ace queen off i really dislike
ace queen off
let's throw out of a small format we're
a little bit deeper
so i think you can actually have like a
smaller five bet
range
queen high board
i started with a 10 but i don't really
mind
checking as well as the queen high board
is quite decent for him
interesting term should we not just
focus on ace king
or should we let him bluff with
something
i think if we have ace queen exactly
let's just let's just go for value
yeah this is the great let's flop
something and get this guy's money
action ranges three out of three okay i
don't take kemp's response seriously
camp he's gonna say action ranges and
then he's gonna hop in the pool himself
so
this is again against this guy so let's
let's let's let's see what he does is
he's gonna go all in again
we have an eight he didn't barrel
so he probably has something right
let's make a mini bet
i did have something
just gonna go away with the aces let's
see what he thinks about that
well
this is this was the marshall lusk
if marshall lusk would be here he would
give you guys
the perfect explanation
let me try i will try to to explain this
hand in a martial disk way
so what i did is
i made it bet so big that it doesn't put
me anymore on aces
but then i do turn over aces
does more blue means more aggressive on
the tag uh
i think if you go hashtag text let me
help you hashtag
tags
here you go nightbot helps you
you're your top five jared man great
player my name is carl grey player goose
court blade player
chrisman chips great player me
what do you think monsieur wacko i don't
i mean i haven't i haven't showed
in my opinion anywhere near to my best
on 500 zoom but
i feel flattered i feel flattered
meanwhile we call pocket tents versus a
squeeze
and we have an easy call on a z flop
turn is interesting i think with tense
exactly is probably
a call again tense with
a diamond seems like an okay hand
as his squeezing range will probably be
more can i say high guard heavy so with
tents we don't really block
uh
we don't really block that much
second barrel stir barrels
like ace jack ace queen which could put
some pressure on my seven to
uh low flush ross tan jack jack queen
jack queen suited for example is also
more likely than
than than a hand like 10 jack queen jack
off
queen 10 suited queen jack suited so i
think tense is okay and to call again
with on a turn with a diamond
uh then else your preferred continue is
like six seven suited 98 suited
on the river i think we have a fault
with tents
holy [ __ ] no more power are you [ __ ]
kidding me
i have no power in my battery
i have no more power in my battery
luckily we don't have a great head
that would be really [ __ ] up if that
happens right
where's my power
man if i had a good hand here i wouldn't
have done this
at this pace obviously
[ __ ] we have no timex anymore
oh yeah
oh we got squid by mr blazes from
kazakhstan
from players so or at least i have him
as a fun player
usually a spot where you could at least
consider slow playing i'm just gonna
rip it in this one i'm gonna bet
this is why i always have a wired mouse
uh smart smart move kit
best hair on the poo for sure thank you
we chop the kinks
i want to thank everyone for joining the
stream
and for being patient in terms of the
four tabling because
yeah my buttons weren't working maybe
the buttons are working next time

session we ran really hard
