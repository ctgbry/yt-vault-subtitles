even in chess these guys like you have
Magnus like the best player in the world
like dude is he confuses people you know
in the beginning because he just plays
like something they're like they're like
confused they don't know about this
because they studyed probably something
else and then he just puts them out of
their comfort zone like putting people
out of their comfort zone is like where
you going to see them at their lowest
most of the time so then like Stefan is
like the the Magnus of Poker oh dude
Stefan oh don't get me started on thisy
oh my God this guy
just I I mean I don't know how many
times I've played with this guy but
every time I'm done I need an
aspiring I'm trying to compete and I've
always enjoyed it and uh I think by by
doing this I'm learning like way quicker
than most people this has been like you
you learn way quicker you just you see
what they're doing and you adapt and you
just like oh maybe because the thing is
I tried to not criticize plays before I
kind of understand how they work you
know maybe this is something I could
implement or this is something I
shouldn't Implement you know this is so
it's like a lot of learning by doing and
basically I was battling Davy Jones The
nacho for a long while on 2550 and 51
and you know I got crushed by David like
David Jones especially he just crushed
me like he really did he just destroyed
me in the three-handed format he was
just way better than them and from the
500 Zoom days he was still just way
better than the rest he was just always
been very good and I think he has
something on me and he just knows like
how to adjust against me very well
especially him I would say so would you
say then say this is also a quality that
you see in like better players that they
just you have a certain game and like
you said everyone's game is flawed in a
certain way and maybe he understands the
flaw in your game that maybe you don't
understand and he capitalized on that
and that's kind of what sets better
players apart
yeah so the thing is I have to say I
played against I didn't play that much
against lus but I played some and I
played a lot with David Jones a lot and
I would say those two guys they just
like know how to adapt very well you
know they just like and I played buckon
clicker heads up too and that guy the
same thing like they just know you know
they played so many hands and they just
know how things work and they've seen my
I'm assuming they've seen my player type
so much they just like use like a very
like let's say General strategy like I
would do on 500 Zoom against me I I
would say I had more of those leaks
before like maybe a year ago but since
then I've been just like trying to work
a lot on my game because I I was
noticing I was struggling a bit on the
higher Stakes so the last let's say six
months one year I've been working a lot
on my game and trying to like okay if I
really want to compete both online and
live I kind of gota gotta step up your
game in C certain areas I was getting
lazy and entitled and like you know I
was getting very lazy I I must say I was
getting very entitled I was getting
attention and I was you know and I I
made it now you know I'm here yeah yeah
yeah that's the thing you know I and the
thing is like I I did very well in a
couple of tournaments which has like
boosted my uh let's say finan situation
a lot which compared to many cash EGS
they they just grinded it up like I
grinded it up too just like them
honestly I really did and then I got but
I jumped like through the stages quicker
I would say because of those like
tournament scores but you know I mean
there is some luck in this but like yeah
if you play enough tournaments you're
going to get like the Eevee from that
too I mean also interesting that you
mentioned like okay when I play a tough
lineup online you try to play more like
the like like the solver game three but
that's also because the better your
opponent is the the more solver
considerations become relevant right and
I feel like in your decision- making
this is something that a lot of players
get wrong and this is something that you
do very well and I guess that's also how
you transition well between online and
live the first thing you have to ask
yourself who am I up against because
depending on the answer that question
your Trin of thoughts should go either
down One Direction or the other if if
you're indeed up like like against a GTO
whiskey k then by all means follow the
solver but often that's not the case so
then you have to ask yourself more well
I know how Theory works like I said
there is a lot of value in that
understanding the solver understanding
how Theory works but then it's way more
I understand how Theory works this guy
is screwing up either too much to the
left or the right and I should now start
adjusting right that's kind of what
you're what you're explaining and
something that you say that maybe
especially at the lower Stak zooms
people are just following the solver too
much and not really thinking about these
type of things yeah so Master dog has
said this before I remember watching
some of his videos that guy's an
absolute troll by the
way an AB troll but I find it very
amusing but uh yeah so he said like I
remember him saying like Okay you can
try to play a strategy that you don't
know how it works or you can try to
simplify against weaker opponents and
just like earn the most money in every
situation or the way you know is the
most mnny because more of I wouldn't say
more often than not but I mean say if
you're playing against very weak players
and those things you just like simplify
you know because they're they're just
going to play like very weak compared to
you and you like yeah my point is just
like people are very like oh SOL SOL
this this this that blah blah blah yes
the solver is very important I'm not
saying it's not I'm just saying like
there are many situations where you're
just
like not doing the best thing and by not
doing the best thing and trying to play
like a s will mean also that you forget
to exploit you know like exploiting is a
big part of Poker still you know even in
2023 it's big part of Poker yeah it's in
my opinion it's kind of the F process
that you go down if you work a lot at
sers your F process is often led by I
have to now do this or they face
something what do I have to do and then
they think about what would the solver
do but the first thing you have to take
consideration well what the [ __ ] what
what what kind of range am I actually up
against let's start think about that
what the [ __ ] does this guy actually
have and then actually what to do will
then come quite naturally based on huh I
think he's quite strong here or H I
think he's quite weak here or ha maybe I
should just bet very big with his hand
in my vacuum because I'm playing against
a guy who's you know clearly approaching
the game different than a solver exactly
you know it's just like I think people
are just trying to feed their egos by
like oh the Sol did this so I'll do the
same and then they go in and the guy is
like probably drunk on a Saturday night
playing 200 zoom and he's yeah he's
gonna call you down you know and you're
bluffing you go oh I played it good no
you did not you know it's like you
didn't yeah yeah you did it's you you
only isolated the piece of the
information in a puzzle that's way
bigger than the actual piece you focus
ST which was well I have the best
unblockers I have the best blockers
let's go where the puzzle is a little
bit bigger I mean yeah I mean honestly
like the best best players in the world
are the guys who like have a very good
5050 balance of this you know like I
I've said this before like this these
guys I talked about like Davey and Li
and Barack as well he's so good like and
for a long time I thought he was like
very tight the guy the kid is just
brilliant you know he's just very smart
and he understand these things like and
these guys understand these things
because they see like the bigger picture
they think about different things they
they take different things in
consideration at different weights than
you are taking in
consideration exactly you know and if
you're G to become like the best best
player in the world you got to like use
a like it's got to be finessed you know
it's like okay solar is one thing but
what about this you know people
overfolded here even though the solver
always calls you know it's just like
because they people think they think
they under Bluff here and they're using
like these like General thoughts and
like how people perceive the game in
their advantage you know this is what
they're supposed to do they just they're
just like yeah like I said seeing the
bigger picture seeing the bigger
picturea I like that yeah and generating
more money and like more EV and like
yeah and honestly
there's it's super smart that's that's
how it's supposed to be I mean there is
a there is let's say for example you
start and at some point the solver can
definitely help boost your game but then
there's a phase beyond the solver sort
of yes exactly which you have to reach
which at some point you have to just let
go not everybody can't remember what the
solver does 100% of the time it's not
possible it is literally impossible to
do play as a even in chess these guys
like you have Magnus like the best
player in the world like dude just he
confuses people you know in the
beginning because he just plays like
something they're like they're like
confused they don't know about this
because they studyed probably something
else and then he just puts them out of
their comfort zone like putting people
out of their comfort zone is like where
you GNA see him at their lowest most of
the time so then like Stefan is like the
the Magnus of Poker oh dude Stefan oh
don't get me started on this guy oh my
God this guy just
I I mean I don't know how many times I
played with this guy but every time I'm
done I needed an aspirin he's just all
over the place this guy is just and I
played some heads up with this guy and
he's just all over the place man he just
has like 15 different moves but honestly
I would say the guy is pretty smart he
does that yes he just puts people out of
their like comfort zone and just and
he's been trying these things for years
you know he knows how people react and
how he's going to counter react you know
but yeah you know if you meet him in the
right wrong mood the guy is just a beast
you know he's just going to be like
playing very well and he's yeah like he
is like a super exploit but no Theory
guy he's like yeah yeah yeah he he so so
he he was here then the theory helped
him and he went beyond but he went
beyond beyond yeah he's yeah that guy is
I would almost say crazy I don't I know
but I do not want to leave I mean the
line between crazy and Brilliant you
know it's a thin line yeah yeah it's a
thin line yeah obvious I think I saw a
video of one of these YouTube channels
the other day there was like he showed a
hand played at 10nl and then they were
making fun of but then but then he
suddenly said but actually this was a
hand not played at 10l but at 40kl and
now suddenly it became an interesting
hand where I at 10l you thought what the
[ __ ] are these guys just dunking around
but 40kl and then was suddenly amazing
it it was MMA Shir dog post that video a
long time no no I think it was um it's
either this uh two card confidence I
think or the uh the finding equilibrium
one of the two that make made like this
this
comparison I think I think the main
thing was that the they a 10l you can
see the same hand the 10l has 40kl but
the difference is obviously the the
reasoning or the thoughts that went
behind the
hand okay yeah so so it's like it looks
like a 10l hand but it's like 40 but he
did a great edit so definitely shout out
maybe I can put the link somewhere or
something was I thought it was very well
done it's like suddenly the
transformation but this was actually at
40kl but like it's quite interesting
like for example what Stefan does and
kind of Go full circle what we talked
about earlier if he if he uses certain
strategies that make your range in a
certain way that you're no longer very
much aware of what the ranges are but
he's perfectly aware of what the ranges
are and in the end if you're very much
aware of what the ranges are you can
make great decisions so if he every time
Maneuvers in a way that he knows your
range and his range perfectly and you
have no [ __ ] clue what you're doing
like I said you need an aspirin uh the
chances are quite big that you will
screw up and not him because he
knows yeah I remember being at the
Bahamas I just like played some I think
I just made fourth in like the 25k so I
had like a lot of stars balance you know
and then suddenly I see Stefan in the
10K Lobby heads up and I've been
practicing my heads Up game for a long
time you know I've been battling like
against the best this is how I've been
learning heads up this is by then I was
like you know what I'm gonna I'm gonna
play St on a little bit you know and we
go railroad crazy man we play for 10
hours straight I'm sitting there in my
ma on my MacBook like in at the Bahamas
playing Stefan and we're just writing
[ __ ] to each other on the chat and we're
just going back and forth blah blah blah
and then he just at the end he gets very
upset and just writes
something so like the guy is just he
just has 10 different moods like you
know I don't I don't know but he he's a
super funny character and I always enjoy
playing with him because you always have
to think you know it's not like this and
this and this and how I'm going to
construct my range and blah blah blah
it's like okay dude it's like you raise
the button key calls and the FL is like
10 and three he just leads out one big
blind all of a sudden you can just lead
out one big blind then you raise him and
then insta clicks you back and you click
him and he clicks you you know he's just
like a freestyle show out of Dimensions
the guy is just and he makes it super
fun to play he's just like super
humorous and like yeah it's always fun
to play with him and even in six Max man
it just depends on which mood you get
him you know so basically he has 10 10
different strategies and they're all
related to 10 different moods so he he
wakes
just puts his feet out of bed and like
which mood am I in today I'm in a click
click click click click at mood yeah and
you don't and you know you can say a lot
of things about the guy but like all of
the strategies are like good like it's
not like super just dust all over the
place he's just like he's really
thinking you know and he has already
made up his mind kind of he already
knows what he's going to do and I think
this comes from like he's like an OG of
the online streets I would say now yeah
you you can you have to learn this there
there's yeah he's definitely OG I
remember when I was mainly playing high
stakes I think he was just moving up
actually yeah he's uh as I would say
he's pretty good yeah and and he's one
of the like you would say like not like
the norm you know yeah I think I think
everyone agrees that he's not the norm
yes but he's also one of the biggest
winners on six Max of all time I think
if I'm not mistaken he's um yeah I think
he's a pretty intelligent guy let me
just put it like that
[Music]
yeah
