uh do you remember the concept of 1
minus Alpha
so
um for our viewers who do not uh know
that it's uh the minimum defense
frequency
so uh
let's say yeah I'll describe it real
quick so let's say you face a port size
bat on the river and uh your opponent's
range consists of
um nuts and the air nuts and Bluffs and
the orange consists of blocking
blockages so in order to make your
opponents blast in different you have to
defend uh 50 of your range if you're
facing upon that
so uh this idea of the minimum defense
frequency was uh initially extrapolated
to alert streets
to turn
flop and even pre-flop
and as we know nowadays
it's not true on the flop
it's a special not true if the ranges
are
um very asymmetric asymmetrical
if one range has a significant advantage
over other the defense the optimal
defense frequency is way uh lower than
this minimum defense frequency
and
So speaking of the AHA moments that
I found in Source videos
um remember I was uh
studying a theory with Matthew agenda
yeah he was very much about that why a
woman is Alpha stuff right yeah yeah
definitely and I took the ranges
and I always tried to found to find that
uh
borderline hand to defend
and as you might imagine
it is usually quite a weekend in your
range a week and it's a very not obvious
and
so uh
I did not I did not recognize those
plays in Source sources videos
and
in fact he was folding
um a little bit more than I was folding
um during that time
and I guess the fact that you that you
do not have to defend those weekends uh
was um
well if not to break breakthrough but
definitely a huge boost in terms of
my win rates and in terms of the
confidence in my game
because I was doing those marginal plays
on earlier streets and they never really
worked
and by simply eliminating them I started
to get more enjoyment and more
more confidence in the place in My
overall strategy that I was implementing
in that time
yeah I'm gonna quote you there you said
have to I have to do this that kind of
you you were in this phase your career
you're kind of Breaking Free from that I
don't have to do anything okay I can
just do what I have to to go back to the
Stefan the Stefan era right now I just
do whatever I want and you deal with it
right that's kind of the the the the the
the
sort of the new approach I was never
Theory oriented mathematically oriented
so I would always just be like it's it
was very feeling based like listen I
just don't see good things happening
with this hand in this situation that's
more how I would then approach it and
probably when you were playing like you
probably also had that feeling right
because you as you said it never worked
out with those hands but there was kind
of a conflict between what your gut was
telling you and what your brain was
telling you like ah but I have to but
your gut was saying yeah but this isn't
working so I guess you felt really
relieved after that especially again if
you have someone like sauce showing you
like oh wow sauce is a very good player
and he doesn't do this [ __ ] this I'm
free now
yeah yeah definitely and Adam asked
about
um mental leaks that I had earlier in my
career and yeah you know this rivalry uh
between having to do something that uh
the theory dictated and
um
that action
not really working
yeah that was a very huge at uh earliest
stages of my career and that's
worried me quite a bit because I thought
that I was not understanding something I
was not uh doing stuff right
and yeah
I even thought that
yeah maybe the theory was not that good
even at that time I yeah had those
insights in my mind
while you the truth was actually that
you very much understood it only you
were listening to your brain and through
your gut right
[Music]
um
we around this time you're playing I
think mistakes you mentioned that it was
around 2016 I believe when you reached
2K was this then Breaking Free was that
enough to reach 2K
for you
um
I guess
at that time I asked
I was still playing a more or less uh
the fixed game but uh
it it will it was a way more uh free
free strategy than uh than originally so
uh
um
I gave myself
uh
I gave myself opportunities to deviate
and
yeah
it felt like uh like a relief
um
one another thing that helped me a lot
with establishing myself but that's okay
was when I analyzed
um
the database of
OTB Red Baron
if you remember that guy like like many
has done before you yeah yeah exactly
and I I've seen
how how freely he played uh how
how much he deviated from the the
optimal game and that
that gave me you know this it's
permission myself to not to play a fixed
game not to play the strategy uh that is
uh
um very fixed and not allow allowing for
any creativity
so uh
yeah I guess uh OTB
will always be in my heart
[Music]
