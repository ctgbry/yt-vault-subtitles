[00:04]
okay my friend
see what you got he had the pocket
threes
oh my god jenny jenny jenny from the
block

[00:15]
block
i'm still i'm still jenny from the blog
[Music]
do you want to know what is inside the
mechanics of poker program go over to
the site where you can watch a free

[00:31]
the site where you can watch a free
one hour demo what's up guys
welcome back to another show the wacko
show
of famous names the pool shout out to mr
jimmy durant of course the jared man
miss alexis
is this soy mimi

[00:53]
a little green tea cannot go without a
little dark chocolate but we got that
one in the mix as well

[01:02]
we also got a little pocket kings here
in the mix you can see i have my
uh settings on dollies
instead of big blind that has been
requested actually a couple of times it

[01:15]
requested actually a couple of times it
really tells me to be honest
i for example right now i have no clue
how big i should go but
on the 15th scene
all right you have to start calculating
guys you guys are testing my brain i'm
gonna say we have a little deja vu here

[01:32]
gonna say we have a little deja vu here
actually we're going to be having how
big is this guys this 15
big blinds my god

[01:45]
okay this gen guy uh young guy is
feeling it
like a little siber turn is quite dicey
this one is quite nice i'm going to go
for a barrel

[02:02]
but i'm not 100 sure it raises it
doesn't really matter all that much
i think on the river i should just jam
and hopi river king queen or something

[02:21]
and hopi river king queen or something
didn't unfortunately for us i figured
there weren't too many female watchers
else i maybe pull out
out of shower loop with just a towel

[02:32]
hey listen if that boost views i have no
problem selling
my my appearance but you know i figured
that would probably not be the case

[02:47]
go for a little checky checky checky

[03:02]
probably
evelyn throws the cards in the mug
we're going to play a little pot first
mr jen it's a jam man mr jenkin to play

[03:19]
mr jen it's a jam man mr jenkin to play
mr jen came to play he's thinking about
it
oh jenny jenny don't oh
that simple was a flusher now it's very
unlikely that it actually is a flush
draw

[03:30]
draw
but he could have a different draw even
though that's also quite unlike
a very interesting river to say the
least
shall we
just let this guy do his thing right

[03:46]
just let this guy do his thing right
fingers crossed for us
okay that's an interesting river
okay my friend see what you got

[04:02]
okay my friend see what you got
he had the pocket threes
oh my god jenny jenny jenny from the
block
i'm still i'm still jenny from the blog
[Music]

[04:17]
[Music]
i'm gonna open the queen eight
actually gonna call here with the queen
eight let me let's go guys
let's go in before the haters

[04:33]
clearly this is a deliberate deviation
from the quote-unquote
correct strategy
calling the flop

[04:50]
we turn good we turn good let's go i am
lucky
i am skilled lucky
that's not the river we wanted to see
but very likely if it now just gets

[05:01]
but very likely if it now just gets
checked around again we have the best
hand
angle of bets out i'm just gonna fold a
good pool today
as you can see here uh nice little table
with four recreationals

[05:15]
with four recreationals
not bad not bad and get three right here
by
z germans and his name is attack
so let the guy attack oh
oh and we're most likely

[05:30]
oh and we're most likely
not going anywhere
most most likely
oh he plots quite convinced
uh okay i just call

[05:50]
a river like
you don't really want him to check
behind an ace
i think with this exact hand we're just

[06:00]
i think with this exact hand we're just
gonna focus on value betting
and hope he has a worse ace oh he just
calls him with pocket queens
guys we are getting handed handed money
[Music]

[06:17]
[Music]
on behalf of the wacko funds i would
much appreciate
i much appreciate your donation
okay we're going to play a little bit of
position squeezed pot is also an option
yes you know our head is quite pretty

[06:32]
yes you know our head is quite pretty
that is a good flop
my friend that is a good flop

[06:51]
because that's good huh
that is good huh it's good huh

[07:10]
today our motto is make good hands win
money
actually that is my mother on a daily

[07:15]
actually that is my mother on a daily
basis
but sometimes the cards they listen to
your motto and sometimes they don't
oh he fall about it for ages okay what
does that mean it thinks about it for so
long
what does that mean that means he

[07:31]
what does that mean that means he
thought about or raising
or he really had a very tough decision
i would not actually be surprised to get
a snap call right now

[07:47]
do this hundred ninety seven and a half
dollar bet or a snap fault yeah it was
either gonna be those two so
i'll make a little car here with the 89
suited don't try this at home guys don't
try this at home clearly this is a

[08:01]
try this at home clearly this is a
deliberate deviation from the
quote-unquote correct strategy
take a little bit
and everyone false

[08:21]
[Music]
obviously we are still quite deep so i'm
not gonna race
as in like

[08:31]
let's say for example if this was a
three-way pot i might just now check
race but
given the fact that the spr is quite
deep i'm just gonna check calm
he bought sixty percent of the turn
he's now starting to tell quite a

[08:46]
he's now starting to tell quite a
convincing story okay
but i think i'm gonna call again versus
a recreational as they just have a very
high random factor
but i'm not very happy about it

[09:01]
but i'm not very happy about it
mr a key on fire from the netherlands
actually evan if you knew if i knew it
was from the netherlands
maybe we should have watched first
as the netherlands you know they're
usually a little bit
[Music]
a little bit knitty man these [ __ ]
ditchy take a little bet here with the

[09:17]
ditchy take a little bet here with the
ace 8.
needed some time to think about it
we can call it check race
there's some ups and downs

[09:37]
there's some ups and downs
get dunked
reasonably big sizing i would say

[09:46]
reasonably big sizing i would say
we have a call
now we have a call again

[10:01]
actually checks

[10:20]
actually going to do something very
nitty which is to check i
know i was a little bit scared guys i
was a little bit scared

[10:37]
[Music]
go for a big bat this time with this
hand

[10:45]
hand
this time this hand on this board in
this positions against this particular
opponent
get check raised the guy's brazilian
and

[11:08]
being quite convincing
we're a little bit stubborn

[11:15]
we're a little bit stubborn
interesting river
ah yeah the guy says or that he has a
lot of heart or that he has i think uh
something random that is a

[11:34]
something random that is a
even random [ __ ] got there
i'm actually just gonna fault but it's
something we're not really used to on

[11:45]
something we're not really used to on
doing okay
let's let's give ourselves a chicken
this end as well i'm gonna sometimes
call sometimes three bet

[12:01]
call sometimes three bet
usually versus 3x more likely to
put through that and i'm gonna call the

[12:22]
squeeze
in a bit small it's interesting board

[12:30]
as i will not have flopped much usually
as i don't really have deuces so either
flop the flush
but that's very unlikely

[12:49]
it's not every day that you flop flushes
right
we're gonna go for a little barrel
i think we should probably just call
again

[13:00]
again
even though we're not very happy about
it and probably we're just gonna call
down
here we get jammed on
and as i stated before i think we just
have a great hand
all with uh i think it's

[13:18]
all with uh i think it's
very likely
that they could be turning like some
hands into a bluff let's say as in like
jack ten
of diamonds or something uh there's also
still the possibility just as i had like

[13:31]
still the possibility just as i had like
king queen off
maybe had like tents with a club i don't
really know if he's bluffing that but he
could at least
maybe triple our hands like king queen
suited we don't block that we block some
value so
if he has it he has it but he indeed

[13:47]
if he has it he has it but he indeed
triple barreled off with pocket queens
which is
like one of these hands that i was
talking about right
that's a good hand versus this nibana
guy from malta
together with plant man remains a

[14:01]
together with plant man remains a
mystery
but i feel like they're wreckish
this definitely looks wreckage
everything looks very wreckish so far we

[14:15]
everything looks very wreckish so far we
have a hand that's not going anywhere
but we
we might want some luck okay i am lucky
i'm lucky oh you gave up that's good
that's good what he gave up with
he barrelled king 10 that's quite a

[14:31]
he barrelled king 10 that's quite a
little bit
a little out of line maybe he also made
a little deliberate deviation and then
he gave the river rake is a figment of

[14:45]
he gave the river rake is a figment of
your imagination
okay rake is a figment of your
imagination guys let's think about that
pigment of your imagination

[15:03]
um recognizing that that's an
advantageous card for his float range
and then setting up a check raised
induction just allows him to
pull the trigger with the bottom of his
range okay okay

[15:15]
range okay okay
here we face quite a big bet we have a
very weak ace
i think actually in a way the weak ace
the three so you i don't want to have a
very good ace
let's say age jack or you want a very
reggie ace like
as3

[15:33]
i think i'm probably calling the river
as well
with the three three is just such a nice
car to have
oh but he's gonna get the chicken sock

[15:49]
yes boys and girls one two three three
two one let's rip
[Music]

[16:00]
[Music]
a little three right here with the king
jack hello cold call
okay and it dunks out yeah

[16:15]
you know my policy on this kind of uh
what i come i think he has an underpair
trying to
try to get calls from draws

[16:30]
try to get calls from draws
i think if the river is a blank i'm
gonna do a dim value but
at least an ish interesting river

[16:56]
he folded wow then do that small then do
bad small my friend

[17:00]
bad small my friend
ah this is how we do
[Music]
a little check race here with the queen
eight interesting turn and so we picked
up a straight flush draw

[17:17]
up a straight flush draw
i'm gonna bet the turn
landman is still sticking along

[17:39]
oh what are you thinking about playing
man don't do anything stupid now i plan

[17:46]
man don't do anything stupid now i plan
come on man give us some respect man we
have no bluffs
set the guy with the queen eight who
who's been there guys who's been there
no bluffs and then turns over and it has
queen eight
ah what do you call i have no bluster

[18:00]
ah what do you call i have no bluster
and then they always have a bluff but
still
obligated to play pocket aces
it's it's not a punishment nopsu napsu
what you gonna do what you gonna do when
the echo three bet you

[18:21]
the worst turn in the deck

[18:30]
i think i'm gonna check
it's literally the worst card in the
deck no actually i think maybe a ten of
clubs would have actually probably been
worse

[18:46]
worse
than bats already

[19:04]
don't try this at home guys don't try
this at home
