hi there boys and girls welcome to the
second episode of the mechanics of poker
podcast in which today we are going to
be chatting with ben raven aka bana bad
beat poker player from the uk plays high

[00:16]
beat poker player from the uk plays high
stakes online cash games at night and is
actually a psychotherapist by day
adam i can imagine you must have gotten
quite curious when you found out he is a
psychotherapist licensed a
psychotherapist let me add

[00:31]
psychotherapist let me add
yeah i'm super excited for today's guest
and to figure out how he manages to
balance a full-time high-stakes poker
career with being a psychotherapist and
yeah very interested to hear what skills
he's learned and how he's helped him on
his career it's a very deep form of

[00:46]
his career it's a very deep form of
psychology to get into so it'll be
interesting to hear his lessons he's
learned and how we can apply that to the
audience so yeah very excited how about
yourself renee what are you looking
forward to picking from the guest
i'm actually also quite curious how

[01:01]
i'm actually also quite curious how
you know studying
psychology in such a deep way how that
maybe
has impacted his technical game as well
maybe understanding more that we have
certain limitations and what we can
consistently execute maybe he tweaked
his strategies a little bit uh to maybe

[01:16]
his strategies a little bit uh to maybe
simplify stuff a little bit more because
he understands his limitations a little
bit better also i've played a lot with
ben and bad beat over the years i mean
he's been a professional poker player i
think 12 years from what i read
basically the same time as me and over

[01:30]
basically the same time as me and over
the years we've played a lot against
each other and especially in the last i
would say four five six years he's
gotten way better
and i'm very curious like what he did
that
made him progress to the high stakes
also in terms of

[01:46]
also in terms of
he mentioned that he's very gto oriented
always curious to learn more about that
so yeah i would say without further ado
let's speak to ben himself
there we are ben is on hello ben hi how

[02:00]
there we are ben is on hello ben hi how
you going on
oh good all good we've already hyped you
uh your batman lifestyle of doing
something during the day and something
else during the night um
i'm very happy that we
have you on i've been following you
you've been doing some things on social

[02:16]
you've been doing some things on social
media as well for the last year i saw
you posting
quite a lot of graphs swinging life of a
poker player
yeah
i stopped posting on instagram more
recently in the past couple months to
focus a bit more uh on playing and

[02:30]
focus a bit more uh on playing and
studying and that kind of stuff and
deciding what i want to kind of do next
with everything
but yeah i did post like very
consistently for quite a long time yeah
what was your initial uh initial
motivation to start posting
i think it was made was it mainly

[02:45]
i think it was made was it mainly
results graphs or was there also more
educational stuff involved
so i cannot really call yeah so
originally um i actually started posting
on two plus two so i have a two plus two
blog and i started posting in two on two
plus two
the end of 2013

[03:00]
the end of 2013
um and i actually posted my results on
that in that blog every day for
uh
maybe six or seven years i have my all
of my my poker journey from that day
forward
um so a lot of people who follow on
instagram so only some of those people

[03:16]
instagram so only some of those people
know that i did the two plus two blog
before but it all started on two plus
two with the poker goals and challenges
um and that's kind of got like
documented from like playing 100 and now
full ring moving into six max then like
shot taking and then holidays and all

[03:30]
shot taking and then holidays and all
that kind of stuff the therapy training
and then it moved on to instagram
because basically two plus two was kind
of dying and it still kind of is i mean
people kind of go on there a little bit
but not so much
um
and then i just basically move the
format exactly the same format over to

[03:47]
format exactly the same format over to
instagram
so i just had i'd like post three times
a week in like one post i would have
two hands that would be for discussion
one hand would be kind of like a comical
hand like that's a
or versus a reg where someone's blown up

[04:00]
or versus a reg where someone's blown up
or i've blown up or something like that
another one would be like a kind of an
ask what people think we should do and
then there will be like a graph of the
day or the week as well and then i would
do like a month recap as well at the end
all right what was your so you basically

[04:15]
all right what was your so you basically
moved to instagram to reach a broader
audience i guess
yeah so around the same time i started
posting on instagram i decided to i
finished my training of my masters and i
decided that i was going to be
outreaching to poker players to do

[04:30]
outreaching to poker players to do
either psychotherapy or mental game
coaching at the time
um and then so instagram was just like a
really good place and adam you know this
as well like using instagram to kind of
like
put out your content and and for people
to be able to kind of have a bit more

[04:45]
to be able to kind of have a bit more
see you a bit more and get to know you a
little bit more
um
and yeah it kind of helped grow the
business in that and from that side of
things and also the fact i just love
posting poker content transparently as
well mainly
so basically we can just end the podcast

[05:00]
so basically we can just end the podcast
right here send people to your blog
and that's it
for people actually before the people
who are actually interested in the blog
where can they find the blog it's on two
plus two it's
the um the blog title is now mastering
mental game and mental health that was
the the title so it was like kind of a

[05:15]
the the title so it was like kind of a
cr a crossover between uh poker and
psychotherapy and kind of my journey and
how people could like just get involved
and like kind of uh
relate to it a little bit
yeah all right well we're not gonna end
the part right here but if in the end of

[05:30]
the part right here but if in the end of
the podcast you know people want to know
more about ben and want to see every
step of his journey go over to two plus
two also make sure to follow him on
instagram for more recent stuff um
what was your initial motivation to
share
to share all this so that's like why did

[05:46]
to share all this so that's like why did
you want to document it
um
so the very very first decision to start
posting was for accountability that was
like the sole reason i was like i've got
these goals i have these uh i had a
really terrible year in 2013 where i

[06:02]
really terrible year in 2013 where i
tried to chase supernova elite and after
like one month i basically had to sack
it off because i was terrible at poker
firstly but also it was just like a huge
toll playing so much
um and i decided that i needed to have
like some goals some ideas some like

[06:17]
like some goals some ideas some like
reasons to play
and
the accountability was there for posting
in the blog
but like kind of oh after time it became
less about accountability and more about
transparency because i felt like there
were a lot of blogs that would only post

[06:30]
were a lot of blogs that would only post
when they were winning they'd only post
winning graphs they didn't post winning
hands winning sessions winning days
they would kind of uh
use it in a way to kind of but not not
necessarily i think it's quite natural
to do that but the image that was being
conveyed wasn't really that of a
professional poker player it was more

[06:46]
professional poker player it was more
like oh this is all the good stuff and
we don't really talk about the bad stuff
as much
um and then it just became about because
the feedback i received was like oh i
really love that like you posted winning
days and you're losing days regardless
of what's happened you talk about how
you feel about it you talk about like

[07:01]
you feel about it you talk about like
the struggles that you're having but we
can also enjoy the highs with you so
it's more of a an eclectic
blog
and then as i got more and more feedback
i just really enjoy posting and then it
kind of spurred me on to have like
bigger goals bigger challenges um and

[07:16]
bigger goals bigger challenges um and
then also talk about my personal life a
little bit more um which i think
in two plus two that was quite that at
the time that was quite unusual i think
a lot more people do that now
definitely yeah the poker community is
gonna way more transparent i actually

[07:30]
gonna way more transparent i actually
really like that from most people that
are out there nowadays they are very
very open because in the end everyone
struggles with stuff right we all
struggle with certain issues and it's
completely normal and i think
you know it's almost like this instagram
model problem right that it all looks so

[07:46]
model problem right that it all looks so
beautiful from the outside and then
other people following your journey
might think like oh wow i wish i was
like ben because ben only has winning
days
uh
yeah you know but yeah the reality is
not like that so i think it's good for
the poke community to actually see

[08:01]
the poke community to actually see
uh also in terms of for example you
in in the questionnaire you filled in
before the podcast you also mentioned
like it took you around seven years to
get to high sex remember our first guest
yours it took eight years and this is
the journeys
yeah

[08:15]
yeah
it's something that they often forget
for me as well it took for sure seven
eight years as well before i reached
high stakes
yeah there's almost like a bit of a a
fallacy isn't there it's like you see
someone at high stakes and you just
assume that they've been there they've

[08:30]
assume that they've been there they've
always been there and you don't you
don't you don't see the behind the
scenes of them putting in the reps of
them getting crushed then shot taking
getting crushed getting moving up again
feeling like they can't they don't want
to get up and grind anymore um you don't
really hear much of that

[08:46]
really hear much of that
yeah so it's actually really refreshing
i i feel to to see some of that process
yeah and also because people people
might say like oh look at ben high
stakes oh i'm sure he got really lucky
you know look at him playing high sex
but they didn't see all the struggles
before so something that you also

[09:01]
before so something that you also
mentioned in the first podcast about
especially in tournaments right oh he
suddenly made a big [ __ ] yeah you didn't
see all the grinding that happened
before then yeah i mean a lot of people
will call you out on that and they'll
say that i actually did bring a
tournament early on in my career

[09:15]
tournament early on in my career
it definitely helped springboard me into
into a bit more financial security but
no yeah you're right there's a lot of
other stuff that goes into it and those
pinks
i'm surprised it took you seven years to
reach high stakes even my perception of
you is that you were just at high stakes
so it's quite interesting that it can be

[09:31]
so it's quite interesting that it can be
that same
i can experience the same thing for
other people yeah no for for me
especially
i think it took around seven years
before i started to play high six i
grinded mid stakes for a long long time
i think just like just like most people

[09:45]
i think just like just like most people
to be honest yeah but yeah then you
notice that then you probably don't
notice me
right i'm just grinding my way through
my mid stakes
well you were always playing higher than
me when i was moving up i was playing
100 and l4 ring i think and you were
already kind of a mistake so i think

[10:00]
already kind of a mistake so i think
you've been playing for quite a few
years longer than me at least a minute
yeah
that i definitely reached higher stakes
earlier than you so probably when you
were playing lower mid 6 i was already
playing high sex but before that
you know i was playing mistakes for

[10:15]
you know i was playing mistakes for
quite a while
but it's funny that you mentioned that
your your poker career kind of got a got
a boost
um
when you actually bring the tournament i
mean i know you're now more as a cash
game player uh
when
you got into poker you mentioned that

[10:31]
you got into poker you mentioned that
what really attracted you about poker
was the view aspect and you quote quotes
that feel
amy kind of curious okay ben what do you
mean with the view aspect of poker
yeah
so that all comes from home games and

[10:45]
so that all comes from home games and
playing with friends and it being like
about beating your friends in parts
showing them bluffs being able to kind
of
play your man type thing this really old
school kind of live poker stuff which
exists right it definitely exists we're
not gonna i'm not gonna deny that you

[11:01]
not gonna i'm not gonna deny that you
people people can get rid of other
people but it was more about that
element of being my friends
um
at the game
that to start with and then that was
kind of going into casinos and being
able to like play people who are a lot

[11:15]
able to like play people who are a lot
older than me like i was basically a boy
i was like 18 and there was like 40 50
year old you know these grinders to play
these freeze-outs and 20-pound rebuys at
the casino and that kind of thing and
actually feeling like i can actually
challenge people
at a poker table who are a lot older

[11:30]
at a poker table who are a lot older
than me in no other aspects in my life
as a teenager or as like kind of a young
adult are you able to really compete
with
true adults but poker kind of brought
that through because it wasn't just
about experiences about kind of how you
were able to
interpret take advantage of a situation

[11:46]
interpret take advantage of a situation
outplay outmaneuver out think somebody
else
whereas like a sport for example it's
way more unusual to be able to kind of
actually beat someone who's more
experienced i think
yeah that makes it so the few is more

[12:00]
yeah that makes it so the few is more
especially if you really
sort of annihilated opponent joe you
really got a good read you really win
the money of him because you made a good
exploit you can really tap yourself on
the shoulder you know whereas maybe
nowadays in poker if you just you know
he does something gto you do something
gto and the pod ends up in his shoes

[12:16]
gto and the pod ends up in his shoes
it's like yeah we were both gto so
nobody really won here actually but in
the past it was more like i got you you
know personal satisfaction from it
exactly
you still experience that sometimes
nowadays where you were like okay now i
got you

[12:30]
got you
uh yeah definitely yeah for sure i think
it's usually those situations where
you're making like uh your kind of
exploit it's usually an exploit
um
and it's going to be some kind of like
super super thin jam or something like
that and it just feels really good
especially when you get caught by hand

[12:46]
especially when you get caught by hand
that shouldn't call in theory and then
it's kind of like my extra bit of feel
has kind of led you into making another
mistake even though i'm making a mistake
in the first place probably by pushing
it that far
uh but and then sometimes doesn't work
out you feel pretty stupid of course

[13:00]
out you feel pretty stupid of course
yeah the exploitation world has two
extreme ants you either feel like a
genius or you feel like a complete idiot
yeah unfortunately much of my career i
felt like an idiot a lot of times
particularly early on probably why i
didn't achieve as much as i could have

[13:16]
didn't achieve as much as i could have
yeah you actually mentioned then then
later what kept you into poker i guess a
tournament being helped uh but you were
also done mentioning
the complexity so at first it was kind
of the few aspects and then what maybe
kept you in poker

[13:31]
kept you in poker
was the complexity of the game
was that was it so that was it more when
you
turned pro
that you really got deeper into the game
that attracted you to the complexity
so i think

[13:45]
so i think
i i think i think that when i use the
word complexity i think i have multiple
meanings to that so like i'm talking
like the theoretical complexity of the
game that's definitely a huge
consideration and that's i really i used
to hate studying poker and now i really
really enjoy studying poker um and like

[14:00]
really enjoy studying poker um and like
understanding the complexity of the game
but also like by complexity i mean like
the the emotional complexity that kind
of goes into being a professional poker
player like the emotional makeup of me
as a professional poker player and the
complexity of that not only because of

[14:16]
complexity of that not only because of
the way i've found myself in the career
as a professional poker player amongst
all these other people who are
professional both players but also like
kind of my own history my own life
experience my own
tendencies my own

[14:30]
tendencies my own
ways of being
and that how complex that is
within being a professional poker player
i don't just see it as kind of that like
the theoretical side of the game and and
um and
the complexity of kind of executing
strategy if that makes sense i don't

[14:46]
strategy if that makes sense i don't
know if it does
i mean obviously if you say this to a
fellow poker player it makes a lot of
sense if you play if you say this to you
know at your local party to someone who
you explained you play pokemon oh great
so you you play cards for a living you

[15:00]
so you you play cards for a living you
know it's like yeah it's a little bit
more complex than that right yes that's
kind of a part that's often overlooked i
think indeed something that i enjoy
about poker is that it indeed is like
the com the complete package basically
right you've been playing poke for 12

[15:15]
right you've been playing poke for 12
years i read and if you look at what
you've learned throughout those 12 years
i mean it's so much broader than
playing cards right
absolutely yeah so it's a way of being
it's a way of way of existing and living

[15:30]
it's a way of way of existing and living
for sure
which is in itself very complex
not only for poker players but for
everything
yeah
that's true
yeah that's very true
this is actually interesting point maybe

[15:45]
this is actually interesting point maybe
i have sometimes way too inwards when
i'm like oh yeah my my life is is
is very complex because poker so complex
but probably if i talk to anyone else in
other profession
uh
he probably experiences similar things
um i want to go back to

[16:02]
um i want to go back to
um you mentioned so you being the
tournament were you already pro back
then
yeah i mean probably what that was or
were you kind of like now i'm pro
because i've been to tournament
i so the the way way in which it went

[16:15]
i so the the way way in which it went
down was i left school when i was like
17 18 and i went back when i was 20. um
and like a good few of my friends
decided that they were gonna pursue
poker professionally and move to london
um and i basically wasn't in the
financial situation i think i had three

[16:31]
financial situation i think i had three
thousand pounds to my name and this is
when i was like 20.
um and my
a good friend of mine i don't know if
you remember a red called ponte lad from
back in the day
um
he's a british welsh guy uh now lives in
australia

[16:46]
australia
and he was always the kind of one of the
guys that really helped me in my poke he
was always more successful than me and
he basically said like ben like you
don't have the finances to do it if you
don't go with these guys if you don't
move with them this is my three best
friends who are better than me poker
he's like you just you're not gonna make

[17:01]
he's like you just you're not gonna make
it in poker like you're not gonna be
able to do it you really need that
support
so i was like all right fine all like go
for
go for it and ended up moving to london
and i was literally like down to my last
month's rent and then i won this i came
second in a tea coupe for 75 000

[17:18]
second in a tea coupe for 75 000
and then won the big 55 for 20 000 in
the same week just before christmas
um and it basically meant that i was
able to continue living in london and
actually pursue and continue to to study

[17:30]
actually pursue and continue to to study
and learn how to play poker
i would say i wouldn't say from then on
forward it was really easy i think i
then dusted probably 25 30 40 of that
trying to learn poker on coaching and
trying new formats and that kind of
thing
but it was then i was actually able to

[17:45]
but it was then i was actually able to
kind of really go like okay i've got
enough of a bankroll to actually try and
get good at poker and actually try and
make it work just got so lucky though
for it to worked out that way
for sure yeah i mean
maybe maybe it would have happened
you know you would have maybe made it

[18:01]
you know you would have maybe made it
anyway but this was your way of making
it right you got handed the you got
handed the bone early but as you said i
think that's always interesting it's not
sustainable you're gonna lose something
of that back because you need to
progress right you need to put in the
reps in order to actually develop the

[18:16]
reps in order to actually develop the
skills to make you a sustainable
uh
poker player successful poke player at
that limit if you just bring a
tournament you will
lose money back right this is a
recurring story with a lot of poker

[18:30]
recurring story with a lot of poker
players and that's simply because
they don't have the experience yet
that's needed in order to sustain
uh at that stake that they're currently
playing right so you were playing
tournaments at the time where you were
just playing
you were just all over the place or
mainly mainly tournaments i heard you

[18:46]
mainly mainly tournaments i heard you
say you were kind of looking for what to
do what's next
i was all over the place um i was
playing some cash games playing full
ring hundred and now
um and decided to play this tea coup
actually i didn't even know tease to for

[19:00]
actually i didn't even know tease to for
turbo actually thought it was a 215
tournament and suddenly i was like level
four and i had like eight big blinds i
was like what the hell is this
tournament series and then obviously
just one every 60 40 for like three
hours and then it was kind of over
um

[19:15]
um
but
my goal was to pay cash yeah and be ra a
rate back grinder that was going to be
at least at the start so how i was going
to be kind of paying my bills um but
kind of going back to what you said i
think that
the the banking the tournament actually

[19:30]
the the banking the tournament actually
just reinforced my like lack of respect
for the game
like i think i didn't have enough
respect for the value of being a poker
player the value for being able to
choose my own house all of that kind of
stuff back then
um
and winning the tournament

[19:46]
and winning the tournament
in a sense you you don't know what you
don't know really you don't know like i
don't really kind of have the foresight
oh my god i got so lucky i was about to
go broke i was probably not going to be
able to pursue this like in the way that
i wanted to pursue it
you just have all this money and then
suddenly you get lazy again and i

[20:00]
suddenly you get lazy again and i
definitely got lazy again straight after
so it was kind of like a good thing and
also just a bit it was a blessing but
also not um
i didn't take i took it for granted
that's what i think i would say yeah the
necessity
yeah you add 3k to your names the
necessity to perform and make money was

[20:17]
necessity to perform and make money was
quite high right so the goal poker make
money
bomb banker tournament goal sort of
achieved right short term at least we
are satisfied we can eat party for quite
a quite a while um
then actually it was funny that you

[20:30]
then actually it was funny that you
mentioned that then you maybe had some
motivational issues you mentioned that
you then started
a super nova elite challenge
was that the same year so um
it was
so it was one year after that in fact

[20:45]
so it was one year after that in fact
yeah you're right no you're right so the
tournament was in december 2012
and i started the pgc uh in december
2013 and i tried to go for supernova
elite january of 2013. so yeah it was
like in that same space so yeah all over

[21:01]
like in that same space so yeah all over
the place perfectly encapsulates that a
whole period to be honest
so you were like okay this is this is
online poker we're just you know the
money is just gonna come to us ah the
supernova elite let's do that as well no

[21:15]
supernova elite let's do that as well no
problem you started
can you kind of
you know yeah because by the end to tell
us how that went
so the great thing about this is that
any question after 2013 if i sometimes
forget i can actually go back to my blog
and i can have a look at the period of
time

[21:30]
time
so you started you started the blog
together with the supernova elite
journey
uh a bit now a bit after so i started it
after but but like i can kind of go back
to kind of around that time when i wrote
about what it was like
and the graph i
really remember because in the first

[21:46]
really remember because in the first
post of the blog it has my shark scope
graph which is just a one line going
straight up
um and then there's the poke graph which
is 120 binds below ev at 100 l just
straight down uh 120 buy-ins

[22:01]
straight down uh 120 buy-ins
bearing in mind that if i'd won that
tournament if i'd lost quite a lot of
money back i've then tried to short take
supernova elite and then i've lost
twelve thousand dollars and 120 below v
in like the first
three weeks or four weeks or something
ridiculous
bearing in mind i was like a zero or

[22:15]
bearing in mind i was like a zero or
like minus no i must be like a minus
three bb player or something at that
point at the stakes i was playing
um
so
it basically was a complete train wreck
like an absolute train wreck how i think
i mean adam you've you you you you've

[22:31]
i mean adam you've you you you you've
got hats
right i did it three years no never made
supernovae
and yeah you did yeah great yeah
i mean like for every one person that
achieves supernova relief there's like

[22:45]
achieves supernova relief there's like
50 or 60 guys that get absolutely
destroyed in that first period yeah it's
a brutal volume commitment to keep for
the whole year you don't realize how
much you strain yourself mentally and
then your quality of game goes down your
mental side of the game goes down a lot

[23:01]
mental side of the game goes down a lot
and yeah myself i remember one year i
committed quite early like yourself like
january february and then by march i
kind of backed myself into a corner and
yeah that yeah it was just super messy
like just shouldn't have done nobody
grind but yeah just push through it yeah

[23:15]
grind but yeah just push through it yeah
like i said most people will kind of
throw the towel in that pursuit probably
wisely so for a lot of people to be
honest
yeah i mean well i think the main thing
would have been i would have just i
wouldn't have had the financial means to
carry on doing it which would have been

[23:30]
carry on doing it which would have been
savage and actually that i i feel like
if i had had my blog at the beginning of
that year and had started it with
supernova elite chase
um i think i would have found it a lot
harder to quit because the blog has
always been like a real great source of
motivation and support

[23:45]
motivation and support
i mean it's been a it's been a source of
some hate uh over over the years but
like overwhelming support more than
there has been hey um so it would have
been it would have been difficult to um
to carry on even if i had people
supporting me to be honest with you

[24:01]
supporting me to be honest with you
what was it unrealistic looking back
then that you were going for supernova
elite not having any experience as a
professional poker player
so i was definitely always a volume
grinder even when i started playing when
i was 18 um i used to play like 24 28

[24:15]
i was 18 um i used to play like 24 28
tables and like play like 20 30 000 hand
sessions like all the time
a lot a lot of the time so i i knew that
i had the capability to play a 30 000
hand session but i think i over
overestimated the frequency at which you

[24:30]
overestimated the frequency at which you
need to be playing ten or twelve
thousand hands a day
uh as opposed to playing thirty thousand
hands
running yourself into the ground and
then being asleep for a day
and then not wanting to grind
and then suddenly you've averaged eight
thousand hands a day or three or six

[24:45]
thousand hands a day or three or six
thousand hands a day over four days
and i just completely missed like
misapplied misunderstood misjudged
had wild expectations of myself um
that were just
all very naive and uh just well i was

[25:00]
all very naive and uh just well i was
like i was as i said i was a teenager
basically like 20 years old
so bring us back so you you you're 120
buy-ins below if you you throw in a
towel right which you said maybe with a
block you wouldn't have done
yeah
you go in a moment of reflection then i

[25:15]
you go in a moment of reflection then i
guess like wow wait wait a second i i
think the 100k next month i won i lost
120 120 buyings what's going on
um i have to say i don't think i started
reflecting on my life and myself and my
feelings and my thoughts until i was

[25:31]
feelings and my thoughts until i was
probably in my mid-20s probably about 24
so i think around that time all my
reflection was given to me externally
so particularly my ex-girlfriend now at
the time she was my girlfriend uh sh it
took a massive strain on our

[25:45]
took a massive strain on our
relationship that uh that first month of
supernova relate obviously
um
and actually i remember in the blog
during the i think a little bit after my
girlfriend actually wrote a little bit
for my blog to share her experience of
what it was like because other people
were asking what it might be like for a

[26:01]
were asking what it might be like for a
partner of a poker player and that kind
of thing so she was a bit involved
um
but i didn't really reflect on it but
she kind of went like this is like
mental like you're unhappy you're
like getting absolutely destroyed we're
spending no time together you don't

[26:16]
spending no time together you don't
really have a great deal of time for
anything else i'm sure she wasn't as
diplomatic as this i'm i'm paraphrasing
um and then i basically decided to yeah
sack it often and uh
focus on
studying improving reducing table count

[26:31]
studying improving reducing table count
all that kind of that kind of stuff
and in 2013 i think i ended the year so
my graph kind of goes down 120
i think i ended plus 12k for the year
um and i probably played like the same

[26:46]
um and i probably played like the same
amount of hands
in the last 11 months as i did in that
first month or something like that
and i ended the same like maybe 50 or
100 lines below the for the year
all right so you did indeed now also
mention your ex-government time also you

[27:01]
mention your ex-government time also you
mentioned that you already moved with an
initial group
was
how how important was that support group
that you had of the players that you
were living with those players when you
moved with them to london
yeah so i was playing with a few guys uh

[27:18]
yeah so i was playing with a few guys uh
do you remember i mean i've said their
names you know smbs and bsnb
do you know this guy does ring a bell
yes yeah um and then there was a guy
called coin flip underscore psy my mate
simon and then there's another player
called peter 804 these guys all played a

[27:31]
called peter 804 these guys all played a
lot lower than you though at the time so
this is why you might not you might not
know them
um so there were four of us that moved
in together um and we were in a house in
north london with every year
and yeah i would i definitely would not
have succeeded if they weren't around

[27:46]
have succeeded if they weren't around
because they yeah they helped support
they helped study they helped give
feedback and this was as you know before
the
study uh the era of study and solvers
and all that kind of stuff and it was
like
well we're just kind of making up as we

[28:00]
well we're just kind of making up as we
were going along but the more
intelligent people did better than the
less intelligent people whereas now it's
kind of like everyone is fair game
yeah
you needed more perspectives right right
now we get the main perspective from mr
silver himself whereas back then you
know you were trying to find people who

[28:15]
know you were trying to find people who
were solver-like who could kind of
explain how the game worked and you
would kind of all figure it out together
yeah different way right we didn't know
what was correct nowadays you know
what's correct you have to try to figure
out why it's correct and in the past we
had no sense of what was correct yeah

[28:31]
had no sense of what was correct yeah
exactly yeah i absolutely i loved that
period thinking i'm very nostalgic about
that period of poker now
not least because it kind of worked out
but it was also like the foundation of
poker and the career of my career and
like

[28:45]
like
i mean i sound like an old person saying
this but people who are starting poker
now or in the past few years they don't
know what that was like
how just
weird and uh and cowboyish and
feel based it was and how egotistical it

[29:01]
feel based it was and how egotistical it
was it was i mean it's egotistical now
but like it was another level back then
do you remember the forums you remember
the heads up for roles like just like
crazy
yeah
but
it does actually make sense right
because you can take a little bit more

[29:16]
because you can take a little bit more
it's what you said that attracted you to
poker in the beginning you can take a
little bit more credit for if you're
doing well because you came up with that
[ __ ] right you came up with stuff that
worked well it's not like yeah the
solver told me so now i'm doing it so
you you will have a little bit your ego
will get bloated a little bit more given

[29:32]
will get bloated a little bit more given
the way how poker worked back then do
you do you think that if you look at
players now from let's call it our
generation
do we have certain benefits compared to
the new school generation in european

[29:47]
the new school generation in european
because we had to go through that
process
definitely versus recreational players i
think we are we are just the best at
playing recreational players as opposed
to new age theory players i mean like
obviously

[30:00]
obviously
a lot of players nowadays more so now
are reg battling there are so obviously
because there's like way less fewer
recreationals in comparison to regs
um but like
i definitely feel like maybe rightly or
wrongly that my edge versus
recreationals is far greater than some

[30:15]
recreationals is far greater than some
of the newer players who are who are
like playing more reg lineups for sure
and why is that you think what is it
about the way we we approached poker
back then that helps you play against
recreationals
well recreational still play the same as

[30:30]
well recreational still play the same as
they used to for the most part and
um we didn't we we kind of had to
use the kind of uh
outside of theoretical the exploit kind
of world to be able to maximize the

[30:46]
of world to be able to maximize the
amount of money we made versus these
players
whereas like in gco like there's just
not this so there's so much less of that
and of course we they do people do
exploit and we are exploiting all the
time but
if we're like putting the word exploit
on like a a grading system there's

[31:02]
on like a a grading system there's
obviously like you can exploit someone a
small amount or you can exploit someone
a huge amount and recreation was still
deviating as much as they ever did so we
just make more money from them by being
able to exploit i think
yeah that makes a lot of sense also i

[31:15]
yeah that makes a lot of sense also i
think because i've coached a lot of
players as well and then sometimes
indeed i i i unders i i noticed this is
one then they're playing a versus
recreational and then they start talking
about strategies gta
wait wait
let's
there is no under the gun big blind
we're playing against a fish there's

[31:30]
we're playing against a fish there's
only butter versus big blind because the
fish is not positional aware so let's
start with that right he has a wide
range in every position so how do we
play in wide ranges right what do you
think this fish is up to
okay do you think he's gonna what do you
think is gonna float very little on this

[31:45]
think is gonna float very little on this
board how should we proceed from that
they're like
very much like yeah but now my range has
to do this it says no forget your range
what what does the fish have
i think i think it's quite weak then
what do you do
yeah then i should probably now uh no no

[32:01]
yeah then i should probably now uh no no
raise him so yeah yeah but you know if i
start raising this i raise everything
yes that's good because he is the
recreational he's over bluffing let's go
right it's a complete different train of
thought absolutely basically definitely

[32:15]
thought absolutely basically definitely
can you relate with this as well adam
you you started playing poker around the
same period uh
my journey was very similar in the
heads-up syndical world you'd basically
play rags for respect in a level and
then you had like a kind of honeymoon
period when you got accepted and you
just played recreational players for

[32:30]
just played recreational players for
your whole grind as long as you didn't
annoy any rags at your level who wanted
to erect battle for a few weeks yeah
playing fish was the same as you've
explained it as well like just this
field-based game exploiting them and
yeah there's no rules it's like what's
his range how do i max exploit that and

[32:47]
his range how do i max exploit that and
the players who do that the best um
obviously make the most yeah i think
it's true like the modern age obviously
like a lot of players are using solvers
as their way of learning and the
old-school way without a solver just
every decision was thought through an

[33:00]
every decision was thought through an
exploited lens or how do i do this and i
think that creativity of every spot
having to think about it led to a lot of
kind of good lines that are probably
still really good on recreational
players
and actually that's what makes poker
still quite fun for me because there

[33:15]
still quite fun for me because there
still is that stuff
like i do a bit of reg battling but i'm
not exclusively rope battling so i
actually get that enjoyment of being
extremely exploit still
which is a big part of the game that i
really enjoy so you get that enjoyment
too

[33:31]
any any more thoughts on what we have
discussed adam yeah so i think i'm
interested in what happened around 2014
when ben started to do some reflecting
so we've got the kind of think of the
mtt we've got the

[33:45]
mtt we've got the
playing some cash games and trying to
figure stuff out living with some pogba
players and having a good support
network and yeah sounds like there must
have been a big transition moment where
you started a bit more internal it's
around 2014 so yeah i'd love you to talk
more about that period

[34:00]
yeah sure um so i think around 2014 and
around after
quite a few years of quite mediocre
success
um i say mediocre like i was i was
earning enough money i was saving a bit
of money but like i wasn't i didn't
really have much direction in terms of

[34:16]
really have much direction in terms of
what i wanted from poker it was just
about making money and living i was very
money driven
and i remember just one
one time my again taught my mother's
girlfriend her mom was doing a
counseling course
and he she basically said oh i think i

[34:31]
and he she basically said oh i think i
think ben i think you would really like
to do this and if my mum or dad had said
this to me at the time i probably would
have just said like but i bet sorry both
my parents are therapists
so that might give a little bit of
context to the whole thing so if they
told me that i probably wouldn't have

[34:45]
told me that i probably wouldn't have
but because i really valued and
respected my ex-girlfriend's mom i was
like okay you know what i'll do like a
i'll do like a 10-week course just to
see what it's like
and i basically just fell in love with
it like immediately just learning um
some other theories uh to be able to

[35:00]
some other theories uh to be able to
kind of have like a bit of a bit of
space away from
well firstly a house full of guys most
of my friendship group of men and being
on a therapy training most people are
kind of middle-aged and women and it was
quite very it was a very very different

[35:15]
quite very it was a very very different
environment and different dynamic and
felt very kind of quite holding quite
containing quite warm
um
and what i really noticed well you have
as part of the training you kind of have
to be sitting and reflecting and doing
group process and that kind of thing
this is very early on

[35:30]
this is very early on
but i was kind of quite intrigued by
that um and i noticed that it became a
place where i was able to talk about
poker and how i felt about poker and how
poker left me feeling
um when in like my other circles even

[35:46]
um when in like my other circles even
the blog in my friendship circles in the
poker world in general that didn't
really get talked about it was all about
like heads up for roles like i'm better
than you i'm gonna play for this amount
of money this is how much my big blind
100 all that kind of stuff

[36:00]
100 all that kind of stuff
so it added this really interesting
contrast to my day-to-day work life
um
and
from the from the reflective point of
view the training basically
thought well you can't you can't do the
training unless you are forced into some
kind of introspection i guess yeah so

[36:15]
kind of introspection i guess yeah so
what were some of the first
insights that you had when you started
to explore your emotions your feelings
in the pogba
context so i would say that for the
first
for the first three years of my training

[36:31]
for the first three years of my training
it didn't come in
anywhere near as much as it did towards
the end of the training and that might
be because i was in a slightly worse
training to start with i was in more
like a college environment and then i
ended up moving to an actual
psychotherapy institution which was a

[36:45]
psychotherapy institution which was a
lot more intense you had to be in weekly
psychotherapy you were doing
two to three hour group process every
week
group processes basically just for
anyone who doesn't know is
you have a facilitator which is kind of
your tutor and you're in a circle and

[37:02]
your tutor and you're in a circle and
there's between 10 and 15 of you who are
in the group every single week
and group process starts
and there's a silence
people are just sitting there you're all
kind of you're all kind of feeling into
what might be going on for you in that

[37:15]
what might be going on for you in that
moment
and then like someone may say something
someone might bring someone for
something forward and then someone might
respond and it's kind of this real kind
of interestingly weird scary
space where
there is no limit no boundary but

[37:32]
there is no limit no boundary but
there's also like an expectation that
you're exploring
some deeper [ __ ] that you don't know is
kind of there
but it is there
and in one of these group processes
poker started to kind of come in it kind

[37:46]
poker started to kind of come in it kind
of came in i think one the one time it
came in was i think i was in a really
bad downswing and i was feeling a bit
kind of like
well actually i was feeling mixed about
it because i felt quite disconnected was
i meant to feel it was i not meant to
feel it am i allowed to talk about it

[38:00]
feel it am i allowed to talk about it
and basically it got kind of received by
the group and we kind of actually like
talked about it and i was able to get in
touch with some of the underlying
feelings that were going on during the
downswing
and that was how it all kind of
started and that was like five years ago

[38:15]
started and that was like five years ago
now you move and in that five years like
the amount of
exploration conversation weekly
psychotherapy that's been about
not only poker and emotion but
emotion in general um and how that links
to poker has been like yeah it's been at
the forefront of the reflective work

[38:31]
the forefront of the reflective work
since then so that's what it's been for
the past five years
so when you first got into uh
psychotherapy you weren't expecting it
to link to poker so much then it sounds
like about three years in the kind of
overlap started to become known and what
were some of the big ones that started

[38:46]
were some of the big ones that started
to show up if you're willing to share
those in terms of some of the insights
you were having as a poker player and
how your kind of introspection was kind
of showing those um traits like at the
time sure
so um i think the

[39:00]
so um i think the
to the first question you asked which
was um well actually firstly when it
kind of came up yeah like three years
three years in i think it was
um
the main uh overarching theme that's
come forward

[39:15]
come forward
and the one that i continue to explore
in my therapy to today
is
like
the the role that being a professional
poker plays
in me then
as an individual

[39:30]
as an individual
like
what does poker playing offer me so i i
can just list a couple of things what
poker playing offers me poker playing
offers me like an environment where i
can put my vulnerability to the side it
offers me an environment where i can be
self-assured it offers me an environment

[39:46]
self-assured it offers me an environment
where i can
feel like i know
everything's laid out in front of me
everything feels in control everything
feels in place even though obviously
poker can be very swinging and all that
kind of stuff but even that in itself is

[40:00]
kind of stuff but even that in itself is
quite structured and quite you know it's
there
um so i think that
if i think of like knowing everything is
it laid out in front of me and i just
think about that as vulnerability
my vulnerability is kind of kept in
check and i don't need to think about it

[40:16]
check and i don't need to think about it
whereas like in other aspects of my life
when i'm doing psychotherapy training
for example you're really urged
constantly to be checking in with
yourself to be checking in with what
feelings you're having in a given moment
and the two are extremely contrasting

[40:30]
and the two are extremely contrasting
and extremely different um
so i think that doing the training
overall has taught me that i'm not just
a poker player who kind of is logical
and have all these labels where i'm like
knowing what's going on i like maths and
i i like theory and my i'm more of a

[40:45]
i i like theory and my i'm more of a
cognitive or a right brain or a left
brain thinker and reminding me that i'm
actually a whole
with certain things that are
more or less cut off to me through my
lived experience and what makes me me
basically yeah yeah

[41:01]
basically yeah yeah
if that's a bit of a rounded answer yes
completely yeah so as you've gone deeper
into your psychotherapy it sounds like
you got to a point where you wanted to
start teaching others and coaching other
players with your psychotherapy
knowledge how on earth did you manage to

[41:16]
knowledge how on earth did you manage to
balance psychotherapy and how do you
balance being a psychotherapist as a
full-time poker player because i know
how demanding the [ __ ] i liked it
this is this is like the big question
actually this is the big question and i

[41:30]
actually this is the big question and i
still haven't got a hundred percent
haven't got it figured out and i can
share with what i know so far through
whatever i've i've talked about in the
past
like i started the training with the
intention or at least three years in to
quit playing poker and move into
full-time psychotherapy

[41:46]
full-time psychotherapy
and i think that a large part of that
was to do with psychotherapy offering me
like a sense of belonging and a sense of
being in a different way that poker
hasn't done
ironically through my training and
through understanding more of those

[42:00]
through understanding more of those
vulnerabilities that i mentioned before
my love of poker has completely been
rekindled and i love pokemon more than
ever my motivation is at an all-time
high it has been for about
three years i would say like i wake up
excited to play poker
um

[42:15]
um
so
the play in poker has never been an
issue when i've been doing psychotherapy
um
but the way in which i've kind of split
things is that i see clients on mondays
and tuesdays
so originally i had therapy and
supervision and clients on a monday i'd

[42:31]
supervision and clients on a monday i'd
be at university on wednesday and then i
would have seen clients on the friday as
well and then i'd play poker on tuesdays
fridays and maybe one day weekend so i
was part-time for about two or three
years
now i work with
poker players on sorry

[42:47]
poker players on sorry
non-poker players on a monday poker
players on a tuesday and then play poker
the rest of the week
um
so
the but throughout the training the
balance was a lot harder because

[43:00]
balance was a lot harder because
obviously my workload increased and i
had so much to do but um
i don't know i managed to make it i just
managed to make it work like both of
them i think the main thing was both of
them felt like a priority and both of
them are a priority
um and i've always been able to do
things when they've been a priority as
opposed to things that i haven't really

[43:15]
opposed to things that i haven't really
wanted to do
but i don't i don't really know why if
that makes sense i'm interested to know
why do you think the psychotherapy
training
rekindled your passion for poca what was
it about going through this
introspection of work that allowed you

[43:31]
introspection of work that allowed you
to be more passionate about polka
because you did plan on going a
different route so how did it come back
together
again so
when i was doing the training as part of

[43:45]
when i was doing the training as part of
the training in the last three years you
volunteer you have to be building up
your client hours
so i i was working in a like uh a what
do you want to call it like a community
service in based in south london

[44:00]
service in based in south london
and i was volunteering working with
people with a range of issues mixture of
like
suicidal ideation depression anxiety
loads of other mental health issues
and i really loved going there each week
and working with them and there was this

[44:15]
and working with them and there was this
really strange disparity between working
with these people that are
for the most part
very not well off both emotionally both
physically both uh and in terms of uh
sociologically

[44:31]
sociologically
and
uh and then going and sitting and
playing poker that afternoon and playing
for like however much money
but for whatever reason it was always
justifiable to me because i was
volunteering
and i was giving it for free even though

[44:45]
and i was giving it for free even though
the goal was obviously to get my
qualification
then when i finished the training and i
open up my private practice which is
what i'm doing now and clients are
paying
i've really really struggled to take
money and to feel okay about taking
money for working with working with

[45:01]
money for working with working with
people uh on their on their mental
health i know that's completely my own
my own stuff to do with anyone else
um
but what i've come to realize is
actually the poker playing for me is a
way of funding
more of a like a philanthropy

[45:19]
more of a like a philanthropy
uh lifestyle where i can actually give
something back and actually not be paid
for it because i don't want to be paid
um and i know there's like a lot for me
there's a lot in there in that for me

[45:30]
there's a lot in there in that for me
because there's a lot of like kind of
guilt about being a poker player about
taking money and
the challenges i find with that and
actually then being able to give back in
some way seems to balance something out
a bit more for me at least at the moment
but again it's a it's a process that i'm
still working on i don't really fully

[45:45]
still working on i don't really fully
understand and i'm trying to kind of
come to grips with it yeah yeah i can
relate to that a lot of myself going
from playing poker to coaching one
minute you'll be doing things for
yourself but like kind of selfish
reasons to make money then you have this
kind of
inkling that you want to help people and

[46:00]
inkling that you want to help people and
you gain expertise and you start helping
people to solve their problems then
there's a crossover point where you get
good at what you do you've got to start
charging people which isn't what you
kind of got into it for becomes a kind
of a contrasting moment for yourself
where you've got to like reflect on what
you're doing and yeah it was obviously

[46:15]
you're doing and yeah it was obviously
myself as well when i started
challenging my coach and i felt in a
conflict not sure why i think i just
hadn't reached a point where people paid
me to do stuff so yeah it was a bit i
had to work through that as well when i
transitioned to coaching so a few
follow-up questions well
sorry

[46:30]
could i ask yeah i just want to ask a
question about that so when you see
there was a period wait was there a
period where you were doing both the
things side by side and then you ended
up leaving poker and then fully
transitioning into the coaching or was
it kind of quite clean i went for a
clean cut approach and my for six months

[46:46]
clean cut approach and my for six months
i was kind of contemplating what to do
and my kind of passion for poker was
starting to fade and i remember like a
lot of people kind of telling me what i
should do next but i just had to figure
out for myself and i basically went down
a path of self-discovery and not quite

[47:00]
a path of self-discovery and not quite
as deep as you with the psychotherapy
but figuring out who i wanted to be and
what i wanted to do it became very clear
that i wanted to help people and i
wanted to coach and i was always quite
good at it like for my youth i always
did lots of sports coaching teachers
always said i should be a teacher and
kind of try to push me towards this um

[47:16]
kind of try to push me towards this um
kind of uh path and yeah finally i
decided i was going to start working
with people so i started doing lots of
free coaching lots of youtube videos i
knew a lot of people in podcast so i was
basically a lot of people wanted just to
speak with me about poker stuff in in
the short term and yeah for myself i

[47:31]
the short term and yeah for myself i
explained through i spent all in on
coaching and i went okay i'm going to
figure it out i charge free free
coaching then super low coaching
prices and then as i got more confidence
i got better results with players it's
all right i'm getting good success now
then was my confidence built i was able

[47:45]
then was my confidence built i was able
to charge more but yeah i was definitely
a process and it is
yeah that's a really interesting it
sounds very similar yeah so i was going
to ask for yourself
if you could give some kind of takeaways
for poker players who might be

[48:00]
for poker players who might be
interested in getting into psychotherapy
and how it would benefit them as a poker
player i know a lot of players watching
this or listening to this will be very
motivated by how do i become a better
poker player and if psychotherapy could
be a path towards that i think that
would interest them more enough for
yourself from your questions that you

[48:16]
yourself from your questions that you
answered before the podcast it sounds
like psychotherapy was a massive role in
your overall success as a poker player
so what are some things like players
maybe looking to get into psychotherapy
what's in the steps they could take or
what are some of the things that could
benefit them as a pocket player

[48:32]
so do you mean uh in terms of going into
psychotherapy as a client or becoming a
psychotherapist i see as a client going
down to explore the route like the
self-exploration right
sure so i think what what we were just

[48:45]
sure so i think what what we were just
talking about is quite interesting
because you're saying you've gone down
the coaching route and i've gone down
the psychotherapy route and they are
very much two branches off the same tree
really
uh because ultimately we're there to aid
someone self-discovery for them to kind
of make more sense of their life to be

[49:00]
of make more sense of their life to be
able to find more fulfillment et cetera
et cetera et cetera
um so i guess the first decision is kind
of like whether or not the you would
which branch kind of suits you and i
think there's a an idea that
again want to speak from my own

[49:15]
again want to speak from my own
experience poker players in general
including myself
uh would prefer to have a more solution
focused approach which is more cognitive
which is more short which is shorter
term which is kind of more linear i
guess

[49:30]
guess
and actually i had cbt for anxiety when
i was 17 years old and it really helped
at the at the time i had it and then it
kind of
for whatever reason it kind of
dissipated over time
but kind of making that decision either
solution-focused or more long-term

[49:45]
solution-focused or more long-term
psychotherapy which is
a disclaimer is that the
psychotherapeutic
approach isn't this linear process where
you go for six or twelve sessions and
you feel better every week
a lot of the time it can be for a year

[50:00]
a lot of the time it can be for a year
it can be for six months it can be for
three years five years ten years and
there will be as in life there will
there be uh troughs and peaks around
that therapeutic approach you're going
to feel better in some aspects of your
life you're going to uncover some
vulnerability or some trauma if you want
to call it that or

[50:17]
to call it that or
a wound that is going to hurt that is
going to bring up feelings that
feel new even though they're probably
not new they probably were hidden
somewhere in our in us
um

[50:31]
um
so i think yeah that would be my first
kind of point of kind of which way do
you kind of want to go and then on top
of that it would be just being prepared
to
really
sit with the unknown to sit with the you

[50:47]
sit with the unknown to sit with the you
that you might be surprised that you
don't know everything that makes you you
that you might be surprised that you
might feel afraid or vulnerable but you
also might feel enlightened and

[51:00]
also might feel enlightened and
great like a lot of joy over what you
might discover
um but in terms of actually getting into
it
you well that was all your questions
about kind of like what you how you
might actually go about doing it as well
um
[Music]

[51:15]
[Music]
i get a lot of messages from people
asking like kind of uh um can you help
refer me to a psychotherapist because
i've so spoken to a therapist who says
that poker is my issue
so there is also this other real very

[51:30]
so there is also this other real very
real limitation that
a lot of psychotherapists
are quite old school and there are there
are but there are younger more uh
radical more progressive
psychotherapists who will hear and
understand you from where you are coming
from but just for a general consensus

[51:47]
from but just for a general consensus
you just want to go to the ukcp website
and directory and you just want to
basically find someone that you really
want to make sure you have pictures and
images on to look at their face
and you basically just want to message a

[52:00]
and you basically just want to message a
few of them have a single session with
maybe three people and then you want to
kind of decide who you feel most want to
and then yeah embark upon that kind of
sitting with journey and
it's less about doing and it's more
about being i think i would say in in
that kind of

[52:16]
that kind of
work yeah great stuff and yeah i think
what you said there was interesting
about
almost having to face some sites
yourself you've never seen before your
insecurities your belief systems that
are kind of below the surface they were
there for all of us we haven't looked at
them and one of the things you said

[52:30]
them and one of the things you said
which resonated with me which i struggle
with a lot is that feeling of not
knowing like you don't know the answers
and you don't know where it's going to
go unless you start as poker players
with very linear thinkers we very
cognitively yes we like to solve
problems we like to know strategies and
sometimes doing the kind of deep inner

[52:45]
sometimes doing the kind of deep inner
work you don't know where it's going to
go and that's quite quite scary to go
down that path so yeah that's up to you
for going down that route and i know a
lot of players who would go down the
same route would get a lot of benefits
it's just a bit of a scary path to go
into that unknown territory but like i
said it's one of those things where it's
not about finding answers it's just a

[53:01]
not about finding answers it's just a
state of being and going internal and
being open-minded i guess with the uh
and i think you've used vulnerability a
few times as well being vulnerable to uh
to see what's below the surface and to
explore that without judging yourself
yeah and i think there are a lot that

[53:17]
yeah and i think there are a lot that
there may not be answers immediately but
answers do come that's the other thing
is i i i answers 100 do come
um and once those answers are available
to you
if we if we kind of take the example of

[53:30]
if we if we kind of take the example of
like there are feelings beneath the
surface that we don't know there
once they are known to us we're able to
like
if you imagine like uh like building
blocks or something like that we're able
to hold that piece and then we're able
to put it and integrate it back to like
kind of the foundation that makes more

[53:45]
kind of the foundation that makes more
sense that actually feels more
solid beneath us and when we actually
examine the foundation that makes us us
that's actually when we can actually be
ourselves we could be more authentic
we'd be more genuine and then like if
you go even at a level then higher than

[54:01]
you go even at a level then higher than
that things like tilt make more sense to
us because we go oh this emotion is
being evoked in this moment and actually
like i've actually thought about this
i've explored this and i've sat with
this emotion before
i'm able now able to sit with that
emotion now

[54:15]
emotion now
i'm able to take a breath and i'm able
to kind of reintegrate it quickly i may
just put it back in the cabinet as
opposed to it just like exploding yeah
in that like awareness of yourself and
the states you go through gives you that
level of control like you said like
you're tilting it's just like an
emotional reaction to a stimulus but for

[54:31]
emotional reaction to a stimulus but for
a lot of people that doesn't feel that
way it just feels like it's a visceral
thing this thing happened therefore i
feel this way by doing that kind of deep
in our work you can like you said put
those kind of blocks in the right place
in terms of it's just an experience i'm
having i felt this way before in the

[54:45]
having i felt this way before in the
past i can feel this way the pocket
tables you know like integration so you
can actually work your way through it so
yeah super powerful stuff ronnie i know
you've done a lot of mindset work and
you went deep into your own mind as well
any follow-up questions based on what we
talked about about psychotherapy

[55:01]
i mean i don't even know where to start
it's a lot of interesting stuff i'm
definitely uh
i'm a very reflective person so
basically up until today
when i play i always have pen paper with
me and whenever a thought comes up or

[55:16]
me and whenever a thought comes up or
whenever phoenix comes up i'm like okay
that's
weird or at least
i write it down
i i keep a report of everything all my
thoughts all my all my feelings also in
daily life if i overreact to a certain
situation i immediately reflect like

[55:30]
situation i immediately reflect like
what was that
and it was funny that that you mentioned
that that a lot of players they don't
they're a bit afraid for what they might
find out where i experience actually the
complete opposite i'm very curious
like oh wow
what what would it be like okay maybe i

[55:46]
what what would it be like okay maybe i
can i can resolve this maybe i can learn
more about myself like i think it's the
association
with the discovery
that makes the difference
between if you want to go there or if
you don't want to go there it's exactly
what you said a lot of people look for

[56:01]
what you said a lot of people look for
ben i have this problem can you give me
a short term fix right you call it i
think like they do it with their
cognitive functions right they try to
find ways around because their their
goal is not to find resolution right

[56:15]
goal is not to find resolution right
they don't want to resolve it completely
they want to perform tomorrow and kick
someone's ass at the poker table
and indeed opening the door
where a lot of emotions come in they get
overwhelmed they might have to take a
break for three weeks because they're
way too overwhelmed right it's like a

[56:30]
way too overwhelmed right it's like a
wound being opened
whereas maybe it's also because i've
i've done a lot of work and i've never
had that experience where something was
that
traumatizing for me that i didn't want
to go there anymore so probably this
shaped my perception towards these kind
of things as

[56:45]
of things as
interesting as light because
i guess i was luckily enough to don't
have that much traumatic experiences
well in like therapy terms like the way
in which we refer to it is like trauma
with a small t and trauma with a big t

[57:00]
with a small t and trauma with a big t
so like we've got traumas with a big t
which are like abuse which are like
parents dying when we're young all that
kind of stuff and then we've got traumas
with a small tea which we all have which
are like something as simple as lying in
the crib crying and our mother or father
doesn't come to us quickly enough or

[57:16]
doesn't come to us quickly enough or
that we are really hungry and that we
don't get fed quick enough like those
kind of small traumas that get like
locked in the body and that's completely
normal for us to to feel and address
but the people that are afraid or maybe
overwhelmed by kind of like coming into

[57:31]
overwhelmed by kind of like coming into
contact with either small traumas or big
traumas
the the fear isn't cognitive because
we're talking i mean this is very kind
of like psychodynamic theory but like
we're talking about like this infantile
experience that is

[57:45]
experience that is
beyond words it's pre-verbal is not able
to be figured out
and that is where a lot of the fear
comes from because it comes from a time
and a place where we were unable to make
sense of that fear or vulnerability um
so yeah that's why it can be so scary

[58:01]
so yeah that's why it can be so scary
for some people naturally to to go there
i mean myself included it can be scary
stuff to
come face to face with those parts of
ourselves
yeah i i can definitely relate to that i
also think in poker it's not uh

[58:16]
also think in poker it's not uh
yeah it's not really the standard call
right i think they also there is a bad
association with emotions yeah because i
i thought something interesting that you
said you feel the emotion and you just
sit with it whereas i think a lot of
pokeblades would prefer it to not be
there or block it right so basically

[58:31]
there or block it right so basically
what you're saying and maybe if you do
therapy uh sessions you also learn them
to
help better understand that emotion
maybe to figure out where the emotion
comes from and that when the emotion
comes up that you're not surprised and
overwhelmed by it but that you're just

[58:46]
overwhelmed by it but that you're just
like okay in sitting in that emotion so
it doesn't overtake you right i remember
also in the in in the earlier stage of
my career was completely into blocking
it okay no emotions i'm a polar bear you
know that was kind of my image now i
have a brazilian wife who didn't really

[59:01]
have a brazilian wife who didn't really
appreciate that side of me so
i learned to sort of okay i cannot be a
polar bear but i can also not be too
emotional and ex it's exactly what you
mentioned of the
letting the emotions in
but not letting it overwhelm you right
just being comfortable with and sitting

[59:15]
just being comfortable with and sitting
with the emotion i think that's a very
important skill that i think at some
point of your career
you will learn right because you can
only
find work
workarounds up until a certain degree i
imagine
yeah i mean but let's not let's not

[59:30]
yeah i mean but let's not let's not
forget that we're in a we're in a work
an environment where we're all men we're
all kind of
middle class white men who are all going
to be naturally predisposed to holding
in their emotions and not expressing
themselves even more so in an
environment like poker um

[59:46]
environment like poker um
so that's like undeniable that that's
going to be about and actually that what
you were saying before about allowing
the feelings in but then not becoming
overwhelming the only way we can get to
that point is if we have an environment
where we are allowed we are permitted to

[1:00:00]
where we are allowed we are permitted to
be overwhelmed
survive it and then kind of come back to
the to the to the environment that we
feel comfortable in but until we've kind
of allowed ourselves to to feel
overwhelmed or like we don't know what's
going to happen
we're not able to kind of like come back

[1:00:17]
we're not able to kind of like come back
from it
i think
what do you think are some signs that
players might experience
which you would advise them
to look inwards a little bit more and do
some reflective work

[1:00:31]
some reflective work
when your uh experiences at the tables
are leaking into your personal uh
relationships in life and i'm not
talking about like not being able to
wake up for like half an hour or an hour
i'm talking like
you notice your fuse is short with

[1:00:47]
you notice your fuse is short with
close ones with family with people in in
the real world
as soon as like you're um being impacted
in your personal life i mean the the
definition of addiction is that uh
addiction is kind of

[1:01:00]
addiction is kind of
um it is an addictive process when your
personal relationships are being
impacted by the action of the the thing
that you're taking or doing and i think
it's very very similar that's when when
it's gone too far
um
yeah

[1:01:15]
yeah
so i think you're speaking to basically
any poker player i have the feeling at
the moment that experience this to some
sort of degree right
well this is it isn't it like people
burn out a lot and i i'm
i don't want to toot my own horn in this
situation but like i haven't felt like

[1:01:31]
situation but like i haven't felt like
i've burnt out uh i played consistently
the days i played for nearly three years
with taking breaks when i um have breaks
planned i probably should take more
breaks
but without feeling actually burnt out
and that's because i always always
listen to

[1:01:46]
listen to
how i feel outside of my poker session
in my poker session as a way of
dictating how much i should or should
not be playing um and if i'm not playing
i'm studying and i'm still focused and
might have my working hours

[1:02:00]
might have my working hours
whereas most of my poker friends are
frequently
burning themselves out taking breaks not
listening when i say listen this is a
what this is a sign for you to take a
break like there's no harm in taking
this down the other
and people are burning out all the time

[1:02:15]
and people are burning out all the time
and if you're burning out then
something's been you you've missed
multiple warning signs up until that
point in your opinion
and then they're usually they probably
just you know rush them away it's like
yeah but i'm a hard worker you know
emotions are bad i work hard oh it's not

[1:02:32]
emotions are bad i work hard oh it's not
going well work harder
yeah you know a lot of these
a lot of these conditionings especially
as you said right mill conditionings
yeah
if we were to poker didn't help with
that that's for sure

[1:02:45]
that that's for sure
yeah
and like the
because poker takes so much out of you
which it does like emotionally
physically your brain is being pushed
you're pushing yourself
like you need to nourish your you need

[1:03:00]
like you need to nourish your you need
to nourish yourself outside of poker and
by nourishment i do mean things like
sleep and food and exercise and breaks
and that kind of thing but like i'm
talking about like relational
nourishment i'm talking about a therapy
session when you can kind of
sit with yourself and you can you can

[1:03:15]
sit with yourself and you can you can
recharge your battery i'm not talking
about like going on holiday and drinking
loads of beers and sitting on a beach
for a week because that's forgetting
forgetting about it right forgetting it
exactly that's important don't get me
wrong everyone needs that kind of
downtime but also that isn't nourishing

[1:03:30]
downtime but also that isn't nourishing
the part of you that is getting burnt
out
yeah i i usually
try to
when i talk to other players about this
i usually like to talk more in a sense
of energy it's like okay when you're
burning out poker is costing you too

[1:03:45]
burning out poker is costing you too
much energy costing you more energy than
it's giving back and i thought that was
an interesting point where you said that
at some point you missed direction right
you were very money driven poker was
what you did because you had to make
money to live and you felt like you
missed some direction that's the point

[1:04:00]
missed some direction that's the point
where if you play too much you will burn
out because it just cost you too much
energy and then you sort of
uh you got more excited and i thought an
interesting point as well that you
mentioned that people weren't reflecting
on how am i supposed to view
how does poker is supposed to make me

[1:04:16]
how does poker is supposed to make me
feel right what is the end goal here the
end goal is that we have we feel good
right on a day-to-day basis as good as
possible and poker should help with that
so it also sounded that you your your
passion for poker got reignited when you
had

[1:04:30]
had
more of a purpose right poker could help
you feel good you could actually get
energy of poker you could get excited of
poker and
i always say that sometimes that journey
might seem harder you know because it
means studying more it means pushing

[1:04:45]
means studying more it means pushing
yourself a little bit more
but it's actually it will give you way
more energy poker will become way more
enjoyful than
staying in your comfort zone and trying
to grind it out because you have to pay
your bills that's way more stressful
yeah like in my opinion this is again my

[1:05:00]
yeah like in my opinion this is again my
opinion i i don't [ __ ] poker
the thing poker does it doesn't give me
meaning
like in life
poker but poker but i've said and as i
mentioned before poker offers me
something internally that i really need
maybe i'm not going to need it forever

[1:05:15]
maybe i'm not going to need it forever
but at this moment it's a bit of a
crutch maybe for me to to satisfy
whatever need i have
but it's
i find meaning i find meaning in the
giving i find meaning in the other stuff
and this is what i tell all of i try and
tell my friends all the time who say
that they hate poker that they don't

[1:05:30]
that they hate poker that they don't
want to play poker i was like fine you
don't like poker you take a break
quit do whatever you got to do but like
use that opportunity to find something
you do find meaning in and i guarantee
to you you're either gonna say i don't
need poker anymore or i now value poker

[1:05:47]
need poker anymore or i now value poker
for what it really is i don't need to it
doesn't need to be anything more than it
is apart from a vessel that means i'm
able to do the stuff that that i want to
do like it's a privilege right to be a
pokemon kind of basically what you're
saying i think i mentioned that's

[1:06:01]
saying i think i mentioned that's
interesting from ama the other day about
about i wish i'd know someone asked the
question what would you like to have
told your younger self as a poker player
and i said that being a poker player is
a privilege that it is not to be taken
for granted that we're we're in the top

[1:06:15]
for granted that we're we're in the top
0.
not one percent of privileged people as
professional poker players and remind
myself that i can do that alongside
other stuff
that's very interesting because normally
when people say to me that they hate
poker i try to

[1:06:31]
poker i try to
say like okay
you know i usually ask why did you start
playing poker what did you like about
poker and trying to kind of reconnect
with that but what you're actually
saying is
what
do you like outside of poker
and see that poker allows you to do that

[1:06:45]
and see that poker allows you to do that
more often so you kind of change your
association with poker you still you
know poker might still not be the thing
that you love doing anymore but hey you
know it it it allows you for some
financial freedom so you can do more of
what you really love that's i think is
really interesting interesting

[1:07:00]
really interesting interesting
perspective i haven't thought about it
that way i usually look for
trying to reignite the passion in poker
yeah yeah yeah but i mean it it it kind
of it's the i see you mean you kind of
you kind of do it first but if you do it
after then it kind of gives you a reason

[1:07:16]
after then it kind of gives you a reason
to do it if you kind of go like even if
something as simple as like i'm allowed
to go on holiday whenever i want like
that's great but like
similar to like or if you have infinite
money you're not money's not going to
bring you like happiness so what is the
thing that makes you happy what can you

[1:07:30]
thing that makes you happy what can you
work on what projects can you do what
good can you do for people your
community
well i i i tell you like what i've what
i like to tell people is like just go
volunteer go go work in a bar one night
a week go connect with people go like go

[1:07:45]
a week go connect with people go like go
work in a charity shop for like an
afternoon on a saturday
but sadly like a lot of people wouldn't
do that which is fair enough it's their
decision but like i think once you start
doing that stuff you realize actually
yeah why not like
this poker thing's actually pretty good
pretty good thing for me

[1:08:01]
pretty good thing for me
yeah i mean if people
kind of [ __ ] about you know they hate
poker and you give them a solution that
and then they don't do that then i think
there is a problem right i mean at least
go try stuff out
right and see what works for you yeah do
you you did also mention that after then

[1:08:18]
you you did also mention that after then
you your passion for poker got reignited
did you notice
what are
some of the things that you notice in
how you approach poker also technically
that
this journey that you were on in the

[1:08:30]
this journey that you were on in the
psychotherapy helped you
better understand the po the the poker
side technically was there were some
things that ripped over to the technical
side or like how you approach poker i
think probably like
more than anything it was like the
amount of work that i put in to

[1:08:47]
amount of work that i put in to
not just uh like writing essays and kind
of working towards something that i
loved but like sitting in the therapy
every week the amount of time
that i put into that and the commitment
that i put into that uh really

[1:09:01]
that i put into that uh really
like studying poker and playing poker
feels like literally like one or two
percent of how difficult it was and is
to
be with all of that other stuff the
feeling stuff the theoretical stuff the
writing the going to seminars all of

[1:09:15]
writing the going to seminars all of
that kind of stuff it completely like
six hours in training for one day i
would come back and i'd be absolutely
like an emotionally flawed wreck for
like the whole night i'd sleep like 12
hours not because i was depressed or

[1:09:30]
hours not because i was depressed or
like anxious or any of this kind of
stuff but just because it was so heavy
and hard work
that when it comes to poker a pattern
that brings me like uh satisfaction and
joy
it just felt so easy it just felt so
easy to sit down for two hours it's my
own time i'm in my own house i've got a

[1:09:46]
own time i'm in my own house i've got a
coffee next to me i don't have to answer
to anyone
like how incredible is that
you know power of perspective right
there the contrast was just magnificent
yeah and that's coming from someone
who's like a really privileged person
like i've had privilege my whole life

[1:10:01]
like i've had privilege my whole life
but going into those situations where
you're working really hard
it's like yeah it's so easy
i guess it also frees up
a lot of space in your brain right
people are often too too occupied with
poker this is probably also when it

[1:10:15]
poker this is probably also when it
starts to infect your relationships
around you then just you know taking
more more breaks or indeed volunteering
doing other things putting your brain
into other things it also opens up a lot
of space that actually when you go back
to poker
you actually see stuff that you didn't

[1:10:30]
you actually see stuff that you didn't
see before because you now actually have
some room in your in your brain again
that actually can excite you oh wow i'm
actually making progress again hey i
didn't see that before so often people
think like okay i need to reach more
successful i want to work more but it's
actually you know maybe a little bit

[1:10:45]
actually you know maybe a little bit
less it's better for you
yeah and i i want to just like kind of
uh caveat the fact that you and i for
example
um
are in a position where we can say stuff
like this because do you not remember
and also adam yeah i'm sure you're the
same like at the beginning of your
career how much how much did you eat

[1:11:00]
career how much how much did you eat
sleep dream poker getting into poker it
was like 24 7 right
yeah
do you think do you think a face like
that is necessary
this is it i i i don't know a single
player who wasn't obsessed at the
beginning of their career because you

[1:11:16]
beginning of their career because you
can't you can't make it in poker if
unless you are obsessed in my opinion
and now we all advise take it easy sort
of i guess
usually you're younger than right you're
like in your 20s you in general have way

[1:11:30]
like in your 20s you in general have way
more energy i think you can get away
with it a little bit a little bit more
but it's not the sustainable solution
no but the thing is though i feel like i
have way more energy now for poker than
i ever did i i honestly i honestly do i
wake up i wake up on a on a wednesday

[1:11:46]
wake up i wake up on a on a wednesday
morning after i've seen clients and i'm
like today's oppo today i'm going to
study from 10 till 12 with my study
partner and i'm going to grind a session
i'm going to go bouldering then i'm
gonna grind another session then i'm
gonna make me my girlfriend dinner and
it's just like exciting the idea that i
get that time to myself so

[1:12:01]
get that time to myself so
i do think that there's there's
obviously a distinction to be drawn that
people you do need to work very hard to
be successful in poker
but that doesn't mean that you don't
need to sleep it doesn't mean you don't
need to do other things it doesn't mean
you don't need to

[1:12:15]
you don't need to
kind of build
build other things around poker as well
it also helps you it's what you also
refer to right you're talking about
there's been a baby and there's ben
right so if ben bebid is not doing so
well that doesn't mean that ben
has to do badly as well right you sort

[1:12:31]
has to do badly as well right you sort
of create two lives so it's the one one
doesn't influence the other as much
anymore
well yeah and then also to have
relationships around you that you're
able to be both of those people and
you're going to able to say to your
partner or like parent or friend or

[1:12:46]
partner or like parent or friend or
whatever like i'm actually having a
really hard time and i'm not going to
sit here and complain about bad beats
and how bad i run all the time but i'm
going to share that actually i feel
pretty [ __ ] about how things are going
can you
hold some of this with me can you

[1:13:00]
hold some of this with me can you
experience some of that with me and can
you tell me it's going to be okay
because we need that right
because in poker you tell your other
poker friends that and they're just
going to say i'll do a sweat with you
make sure you're studying um make sure
that you're taking a break every hour
make sure you've got a sip of water do

[1:13:15]
make sure you've got a sip of water do
some meditation like great but like
where's the human contact it says like
oh practical stuff right
yeah
they're not going in but i think it's
also because poker players they make
vocal what's the problem the problem is
i had a lot of bad beats today they're

[1:13:31]
i had a lot of bad beats today they're
not saying you know they're not giving a
very deep answer in terms of what
they're experiencing emotionally so then
i guess also the the response is also
different i mean you learned this uh in
in like long term relationship for
example me and my wife if you want to

[1:13:45]
example me and my wife if you want to
have good communication you need to
learn to
communicate from a point of what you're
feeling right
not
people often get angry at each other but
they're often sad for example so it's
better to try to communicate listen i'm
sad for these reasons instead of

[1:14:00]
sad for these reasons instead of
communicating that you're angry about
the fact that you're gonna love that
beats today that that
that leads to a way better conversation
and then the other person that you're
having this conversation with is also
like oh this is actually the interesting
conversation he said oh here you have
another crybaby bitching about bad beats

[1:14:15]
another crybaby bitching about bad beats
all the time you know
yeah and don't get me wrong i sometimes
i leave my office going to the kitchen
and i just go like to my girlfriend like
i got bad beat with aces three times and
i'm down 10k and she's like oh no like
that happens as well sometimes so it's
not about just not just not having one

[1:14:30]
not about just not just not having one
or the other it's about having like a
an eclectic one yeah
i also thought it was interesting you
mentioned so that you i think it was on
monday you work with non-poker players
on a tuesday with poker players

[1:14:46]
do you notice that there are certain
things that are specific
problems that poker players
have
instead of i wanted to say normal other
normal people but people are not poker
players you know yeah
are they like sorry i assume certain

[1:15:01]
are they like sorry i assume certain
things are universal and certain things
are specific to poker players yeah i
also need to be a little bit careful
about talking about clients and their
kind of issues but like in terms of
overall generally i think that there are
some themes with with poker players and
i do think uh

[1:15:15]
i do think uh
that there is
a lot of kind of what's the word um
uh like displacement
um like poker players live around the
world in a lot of different places and i
think i've noticed a bit of a kind of uh

[1:15:30]
think i've noticed a bit of a kind of uh
i don't know patterns may be fair or not
but there's certainly the the
difficulty to come into contact with
feeling and i can say that because i'm a
poker player who really struggled to
come into contact with feeling for a
large part of my life and only recently
haven't been able to as i said but also

[1:15:46]
haven't been able to as i said but also
a lot of kind of um
toxicity in family dynamics i would say
a lot of this kind of um
the poker player

[1:16:00]
the poker player
feeling like they kind of need to be all
self-sustaining
not relying on anyone that no one's
going to be there for them but them just
themselves they can only rely on
um and
most of the time that's to do with yeah

[1:16:16]
most of the time that's to do with yeah
like relationships not being great at
home i would say and he said then also
cause to maybe
the relationships around poker players
maybe
some relationships around them don't
really still accept the fact that

[1:16:31]
really still accept the fact that
they're a poker player or they're not as
supportive and then maybe you feel more
of the need to prove that you know
because i love playing a lot of times
when you say i'm going to become a
professional poker player it's not like
everyone is around you like hey yeah
great idea go do that before for a
living no that's usually not what you

[1:16:45]
living no that's usually not what you
get are you sure so i think a lot of
poker players that i spoke to have a
certain consciously or constantly have a
sort of need to prove
them themselves and to kind of
you know show that they made the correct
decision which puts extra pressure on
the player totally 100

[1:17:02]
the player totally 100
and i think that's a large part of the
reason why a lot of poker players won't
ask for help
emotionally or psychologically because
of that self-sustaining attitude which
again isn't just um
uh just poke players for for a lot of

[1:17:16]
uh just poke players for for a lot of
people but
particularly in the poker playing world
for sure
and what i will say so i i don't know if
i i don't know if i made this clear
before i didn't think i did basically i
started to try and do mental game
coaching adam um i was thinking about
doing it and i kind of put together this

[1:17:31]
doing it and i kind of put together this
kind of i worked with my supervisor to
really think about how i could bring a
therapeutic slash mental game approach
and it basically like it didn't really
work for me and i found it quite
difficult to kind of bridge this this

[1:17:45]
difficult to kind of bridge this this
weird
thing between the two and my sessions
ended up invariably after three or four
sessions turning into psychotherapy
so
actually the things that they kind of
came in wanting to work with on like a
kind of uh like i want to be able to
grind more my motivation is low and that

[1:18:00]
grind more my motivation is low and that
kind of stuff
ultimately came down to talking about
like them their relationships their
lived experience who they are and all
that kind of stuff
to the point where now i don't work with
poker players in the mental game
capacity all my poker players who were

[1:18:15]
capacity all my poker players who were
mental gain clients are now
psychotherapy clients so i've decided to
stop doing the the mental game coaching
side of things it's quite funny how it
kind of went like that yeah that's super
interesting actually because i when i
started going into working with poker
players i came from a performance side
because i'm a background in sports

[1:18:30]
because i'm a background in sports
science and i'm quite a kind of into
good habits and routines and how to
optimize living and as i again as i got
into coaching the same as you i realized
wait a second there's a lot of deeper
problems that aren't probably solved on
this kind of surface level stuff so that
got me deep into the mind and i think

[1:18:45]
got me deep into the mind and i think
mental game and therapy there's like
kind of a there's a crossover somewhere
on those lines when you go deeper and
deeper into the mental work so yeah i
can relate to that and for myself i went
from performance deep into mindset and
even now i'm going deeper deeper into uh
psychology and belief systems and kind

[1:19:01]
psychology and belief systems and kind
of subconscious programs that hold
people back to uh which is the only
thing
so yeah i think it's one of those things
when you actually
try to help people it comes to the point
where there's a core route that needs to
be addressed and the deeper you go up
with the person the more you find those

[1:19:15]
with the person the more you find those
routes are quite common and they can't
be avoided so if you don't dig deep
enough you can cover up for the service
all you want you try and have a nice
lifestyle on the surface these things
underneath need to be solved so as you
start to help people solve those
problems very often it does lead into a
therapy-based discussion or at least

[1:19:31]
therapy-based discussion or at least
exploring some of their deeper parts
which they haven't explored before
yeah totally yeah um
associated with that i mean i i've never
i i don't call myself a
mental game coach but obviously i have

[1:19:46]
mental game coach but obviously i have
quite a lot of experience i've coached a
lot of players and i've talked with a
number of players and it's indeed like
it basically
you have sort of easy problems to fix
but then problems get deeper and the
issue doesn't get resolved i've had this
with many students of mine as well and
then you go deeper and deeper and deeper

[1:20:00]
then you go deeper and deeper and deeper
and at some point indeed like you have
to go to past and usually i then refer
them to other people because i don't
feel like
i'm the right person to talk i do feel
like i have a good understanding and i
could help but i just don't feel like
it's my place per se i don't feel that

[1:20:15]
it's my place per se i don't feel that
comfortable
with it and i don't want to say the
wrong things
in that area but indeed at some point
you just have to dig deeper if i have a
student
who who i have hand history sessions
with and every time he just makes the
same puns and then literally explains me
i don't know why i do this then at some

[1:20:32]
i don't know why i do this then at some
point you know we've reached the point
like okay i cannot help you anymore on a
technical site right yeah
then then i then i do ask that okay what
do you feel at that moment yeah i'm very
angry
and you know but then to dig deeper
that's at some point you need it in my

[1:20:46]
that's at some point you need it in my
opinion you can you can do quick fixes
you can find ways around it but if you
really want to have
a good feeling
and get a good feeling out of playing
poker it's way better to look for a
long-term resolution i think i love
these issues

[1:21:01]
these issues
no i definitely agree and actually
that's i think you perfectly highlighted
the whole point it's like there's a
there's a balance between when something
goes from advice
into
something else there's only so much
advice you can give and i think that my
entire training has i've never been

[1:21:17]
entire training has i've never been
taught or supported in giving advice
my whole thing is kind of being able to
deepen exploration and no advice giving
whatsoever so mental game coaching was
really challenging for me because i knew
i needed to be able to

[1:21:31]
i needed to be able to
share my experience as a poker player
and give some advice
but also i find it quite disconcerting
giving advice unless it's to a friend or
something like that because there's no
there's nothing at stake if it's to a
friend really
oh sorry i guess it didn't satisfy you
you were there to really help people and

[1:21:46]
you were there to really help people and
you saw there were deeper issues like
but i'm a mental game coach yeah exactly
i'm not a psychotherapist but
psychotherapy would not really help him
but sometimes also i guess you don't
want to open something up if someone's
goal is this and i want to let's say for

[1:22:00]
goal is this and i want to let's say for
example last three months supernova
elite let's pretend it still existed
you probably don't want to start
psychotherapy at that point right you
just want to go to the mental game coach
and try to find some quick fixes to
reach
the supernova league so maybe some
players would also come to you and they

[1:22:16]
players would also come to you and they
didn't they don't actually want the
long-term fix they don't want you to
open up a bunch of stuff because they
need to perform
tomorrow yeah and yeah i think that's
another really good point that like to
adam's question earlier if you're going
into psychotherapy you need to maybe be

[1:22:30]
into psychotherapy you need to maybe be
prepared that you're gonna feel worse
and therefore unable to play poker for a
period of time and that might be part of
the process
yeah you have to kind of accept that i
want to go back a little bit to to a bit
more the technical side i heard you talk
about uh

[1:22:45]
about uh
you sneaked in like oh i study between
10 and 12 and then i go play
did that i just followed that and also
you you you talked before about that you
had a closed pair group okay and now you
also refer to you're doing it with your
study buddy

[1:23:00]
study buddy
how big of an impact
has that have and how does your current
improving in poker technically speaking
routine kind of look like can you take
us through that
yeah so um i think i mentioned it a
little bit before but my my study early

[1:23:16]
little bit before but my my study early
on in my career was just like leeching
information of people who are better
than me who understood the game better
than me and
i don't think there's any way getting
around that that was a reality
um and then
i got better and then i think i just we

[1:23:30]
i got better and then i think i just we
i continued to talk to people about
strat who were better than me i then got
pious over i then had to ask people who
are better than me to show me how to use
it
and then in more recent times my study
partner is uh you know clanty
you know clancy
yeah yeah he's my study partner we've

[1:23:46]
yeah yeah he's my study partner we've
been studying together for i think
nearly two years now and we have like a
routine where we study every wednesday
and every friday from like 10 till 1 or
10 till 12. um and we have like thematic
study where we do topics and

[1:24:01]
study where we do topics and
like different very like very rarely
we'll do like a hand history review will
usually be like deep diving into piyo
and kind of really kind of like coming
to grips with
different concepts
um but again clancy is someone who is

[1:24:15]
um but again clancy is someone who is
better than me a poker better than me
theoretically um
he understands the game a lot more and
we do have a very we're mates like as
well like it's not like just a study
relationship but
being able to kind of bounce my kind of
knowledge and understanding of poker as

[1:24:30]
knowledge and understanding of poker as
well as his theoretical understanding is
that i form this really really
just um
helpful environment where we're both
learning like extreme amounts forever
like over the past couple years
um but it's always been with people who

[1:24:45]
um but it's always been with people who
are
better than me actually always always
and it's very deliberate right you said
you have a strict it's that day you
already kind of before you go in it's
not like hey clanty what's up you know
what should we talk about today i
imagine it's a little bit more
structured you guys know what's going to

[1:25:01]
structured you guys know what's going to
be discussed
yeah always always and we have we have
like a list of topics that we're what we
we're intending on working through over
the months or even the years to come and
we've been like we spent like a whole
long period on just one situation like

[1:25:16]
long period on just one situation like
maybe like four or five months every
twice a week we were studying one
scenario that comes up frequently um
and now like that's the strongest part
of my game so like there's been a direct
correlation between what we studied and
actually being able to kind of implement
it

[1:25:30]
it
and actually a big shout out to him
because i know one of the things on the
question that we talked about before
were like kind of goals in poker and
that kind of thing
and just to touch on it a little bit
he's been when i started start playing
with him i've been playing five playing

[1:25:45]
with him i've been playing five playing
500 zoom once we started studying like a
couple years ago
and it's only been in the past year or
so where he's really
made me believe and push me probably
giving me my own mental game coaching in
some kind of way that actually i can
aspire to be much better i can aspire to
play high stakes that i can aspire to be

[1:26:02]
play high stakes that i can aspire to be
a much better player than i am and
actually battle with people who are who
i see as being a lot better than me um
and that's actually what's been
happening so i've been actually able to
move up and
that
without that relationship i would have
been playing 500

[1:26:16]
been playing 500
and yeah definitely not playing these
red tables and high stakes
so this seems to be a theme right also
you know you mentioned all the way in
the beginning you moving with your mates
in london uh so you're like a sponge you
you you soak in the information from

[1:26:31]
you you soak in the information from
people around you you're very very
excited but i i imagine that
sorry a sponge is a nice word for a
leech i think but yeah
but i imagine like you kind of maybe

[1:26:45]
but i imagine like you kind of maybe
maybe um
uh selling yourself short hair because
obviously there's a reason why clanty
studies with you right what what do you
think
that are like your strengths when it
comes to the technical side of the game
that clanty is interested in i mean i'm
sure clanty you know if clanty wants to

[1:27:02]
sure clanty you know if clanty wants to
do a two-hour study session with me
every week i'm open to that you know you
can call me
so
um so like this all comes from my blog
all
pretty much
nearly all of my relationships in poker

[1:27:15]
nearly all of my relationships in poker
come from my blog that weren't my
initial friendship group so i had a lot
of people over the years just talk to me
reach out to me
we did like london meetups we made skype
groups we made discord groups i think
the one thing i will say is that like
yes i have like uh have people who are

[1:27:30]
yes i have like uh have people who are
better than me teach me but i've been
very forthcoming with giving information
like you know eastie in his discord we
kind of like try and talk about hands
and like just generally trying to kind
of pay that forward as much as possible
um
but with clancy he basically messaged me

[1:27:46]
but with clancy he basically messaged me
i think it must have been in about 2017
something like that and he was playing i
think maybe 100 or 200 and he just we
got talking a little bit
and then as pio kind of became more of a
thing and he he's very theory-oriented

[1:28:00]
thing and he he's very theory-oriented
he's very very good with pio and makes a
lot of content for runner watson stuff
as he got more interested in the theory
side and as poker moved into a more
theoretical theoretically based game
i think we did like a random study one

[1:28:15]
i think we did like a random study one
time
it's funny i hardly remember the start
he actually remembers when it started
but i can't exactly remember now
and it just became like oh do you want
to do one next week i was like yeah
right sure and at the time it was just a
hand review he was playing probably some
200 i was doing some 500 um and

[1:28:31]
200 i was doing some 500 um and
we were just kind of
making it up as we went along and then i
think he really really went for he
started coaching and he started kind of
studying more and he just became like a
bit of a wizard with the whole thing
and then the study moved into more kind
of thematic and consistent studies and

[1:28:48]
of thematic and consistent studies and
now kind of just went goes without
saying so yeah that's how we met
again it's quite interesting right
people
that would now look at it oh look at ben
you know he's so lucky that he has like
an ant boss like clanty studying with
him but actually when you started it was

[1:29:02]
him but actually when you started it was
actually you
who were quote quote you know better or
at least higher in in stakes than clanty
so basically i think i think that's
right i'm not 100 sure but yeah
so you gave and and this is this is what

[1:29:15]
so you gave and and this is this is what
i experienced for example i'm sure you
played with the poker clue
when me and
start the work together i was already
playing high six and he was still
playing 500 now zoom 200 now zoom
i helped him yeah you know
we all know where he is now
and now i can help he can help me again

[1:29:31]
and now i can help he can help me again
right and i've seen this
through you you sometimes need to invest
a little bit in certain relationship in
the beginning you're going to be giving
a lot but in the end
that you you build this community which
is very important if i have a question
now i i don't know how many smart minds

[1:29:46]
now i i don't know how many smart minds
i can ask a question where i get a good
answer from it's insane like i have no
no matter where i am in poker i'm sure i
can find the answer in some of my
contacts
right and this is exactly what you
mentioned how important the the the

[1:30:01]
mentioned how important the the the
support group is around that from
an emotional side from a technical side
from
just experience maybe even after poker
right you also mentioned some friends of
you are now retired maybe if you want to
retire you know ask them for advice

[1:30:17]
retire you know ask them for advice
i think this is very important to
surround yourself with with the right
players
from what i recall adam you've had
similar experiences
sharing grind houses villas i should say
in bali with other poker players trying

[1:30:32]
in bali with other poker players trying
to develop your career yeah well villa
sounds glamorous but basically it's just
a
place to live germany in thailand or
bali uh we call it the villa rather than
a house because it's got a nice pool but
yeah when i started poker as well i got

[1:30:46]
yeah when i started poker as well i got
quite lucky to uh go with two friends
from university and we got a place in
bali originally oh so thailand was our
first stop in phuket um we basically
just club dominic together had a little
bankroll and quite similar to ben like

[1:31:00]
bankroll and quite similar to ben like
this not really knowing what you're
doing but being in kind of a supportive
group and just trying to figure out this
poker problem or game together and i
think like if any one of us had done
this by ourselves it would have been
complete failure in all honesty i was
kind of in it for the team environment

[1:31:15]
kind of in it for the team environment
being part of a little group and us
against the world mentality trying to
figure out this card game whilst the
rest of the world thought you were crazy
um so yeah i think having that
supportive network around you especially
early is huge and as you get further
developed it becomes important for
different reasons for your continued

[1:31:31]
different reasons for your continued
development so uh initial core support
group to uh almost support the dream and
keep you going and then as you get more
developed like ben's even experiencing
now someone to show you a next level to
go to a role model or someone to push
that other step because i think as a

[1:31:46]
that other step because i think as a
poker player we always get to a point
where we just stop we stop ourselves
just based on our own limitations our
own belief systems our identity we get
the point where it feels good enough and
sometimes it takes that one person in
your group to go live why stop here why
not go further oh never thought of it so

[1:32:01]
not go further oh never thought of it so
i yeah it sounds like i know brenda
you've had people you're sick like that
and then i've been uh as well so yeah i
think so it's so important to have that
that support group
so i want to ask you a question ben and
what was poker like before learning
psychotherapy compared to pogba playing
after in terms of like a day-to-day

[1:32:16]
after in terms of like a day-to-day
grind and what what it feels like to be
a poker player after you've went for
your psychotherapy training
so the the two words that come to mind
is before psychotherapy training i was a
recreational and unprofessional and i

[1:32:30]
recreational and unprofessional and i
would say that post psychotherapy i feel
like a a true professional
and i think before it was
grinding
way too late and
not consistent hours it was being sloppy
with sleep with diet with breaks i would

[1:32:47]
with sleep with diet with breaks i would
take
like a big big big big thing for a long
time was i would have i suffered
massively from winners till
so uh if i was uh when it went but like
the opposite to what i think it normally

[1:33:01]
the opposite to what i think it normally
is described as if i was winning i would
just grind all the time i would just
like be riding think have this fallacy
of riding some kind of wave keep
grinding uh when i went on upswings i'd
be grinding grinding grinding as soon as
i started losing i would just not play

[1:33:15]
i started losing i would just not play
and sometimes i would like not play i'd
get smashed lose like 20 buttons or
whatever
uh
take like three days off come back
lose a few binds take a week off come
back and until like i had a winning
session which could be over like a six

[1:33:30]
session which could be over like a six
week period
i because i had only played five times
um i wouldn't i wouldn't play basically
it's just so stupid so so like
unprofessional
um
and then kind of yeah similar to the
points that we've kind of brought in
just the idea of like my um

[1:33:45]
just the idea of like my um
my appreciation for the freedom of poker
and what it offers me and all that kind
of stuff uh now it looks like so as i
said clients mondays clients tuesdays
wednesday
thursday
friday and either friday or saturday

[1:34:00]
friday and either friday or saturday
night i grind so i always grind either a
friday or saturday and then spend the
other night with my girlfriend usually
uh so we always try and kind of like
have something booked in either on the
friday saturday to do something together
and then sunday i'll grind some of the
day but not all day and then mondays i

[1:34:15]
day but not all day and then mondays i
think i haven't grinded a monday for
about six years i've had a monday off
every single every single week
um and a tuesday majority have those off
but sometimes quite a bit yeah
it's very like very uh it sounds
regimented and it sounds a bit kind of

[1:34:31]
regimented and it sounds a bit kind of
like forced
but it's really flexible and amongst
that i'm socializing i'm going doing as
a bouldering i climb a lot with friends
and that kind of thing like i'm doing a
lot of other stuff but
i'm also playing my poker hours as like

[1:34:45]
i'm also playing my poker hours as like
a semi-party player it sounds very
balanced but also sounds very well
designed like you designed every day in
alignment with your preferences what
gives you meaning what gives you energy
what's enjoyable so yeah i think a lot
of people could take um some inspiration

[1:35:00]
of people could take um some inspiration
from that like obviously it said points
of your career it is hustle mode pay the
bills that kind of stuff but the end
goal is to get a point where you design
your life and i think with your kind of
psychotherapy background you're at that
stage now where you're super grateful
for the life you have and you're able to
create the life in alignment with the

[1:35:15]
create the life in alignment with the
meaningful things for you so yeah great
work as well and taking that one day off
that kind of disciplined one day i think
it's one of those things as poker
players a lot of players i've worked
with they struggle to take time off and
especially consistently and it's almost
this kind of
oh i know i should take time off but

[1:35:30]
oh i know i should take time off but
there's like a conflict there which
it's strange because it should never be
really like tinnitus not the end of the
world it's actually a beneficial thing
for almost everyone see i think like
locking in that one day of the week off
i think a lot of pocket players could
like learn from that and apply
themselves as well

[1:35:46]
yeah and actually like i think to those
people that you just spoke about how
often do they how often do they burn out
how often do they take that week off the
whole week off or two weeks off and
actually if you take 14 days off you've
actually you've wasted maybe the
equivalent of 14 weeks of grinding

[1:36:01]
equivalent of 14 weeks of grinding
because you could have taken one day off
each week
and then actually have played like 25
more hands if you kept that consistency
up so it's the short term relief over
the long term i guess yeah i think
people don't realize that when you don't
like look after yourself in the short

[1:36:15]
like look after yourself in the short
term like you are on path to some sort
of burnout and yeah i can speak of like
a lot of players i've worked with and
especially the hard working ambitious
go-getter personalities they will almost
have like these kind of weeks where they
kind of rest and burn out but they

[1:36:30]
kind of rest and burn out but they
wouldn't even acknowledge it it's been
an hour to almost just be part of their
two-month kind of schedule oh yeah
grinding crazy and then they recover and
get back to it but they wouldn't live in
the patterns of just like a
habitual thing but like you said taking
that one day off a week can often save

[1:36:45]
that one day off a week can often save
you a lot of time in the long term and i
can see by your relationship with poca
he's actually grown stronger by having
like more bricks like less like hardcore
grinding less that break back grinds and
mentality you enjoy the game more i'm
sure as a byproduct you enjoy the game

[1:37:00]
sure as a byproduct you enjoy the game
more your performance is better your win
rate's better i'm sure you're a better
person to be around for your partner
yeah i'm sure like everything in your
life magnifies because your relationship
is healthy so yeah some some great
takeaways there from you
and uh it's actually funny when like as

[1:37:15]
and uh it's actually funny when like as
at the end of the years i always post my
results in my blog as i said and people
always comment every single year on they
don't know that like they're like have
you played so many hands
and uh because like most of the time i
play more hands than most of the people
who are playing actually full time
um and and uh

[1:37:32]
um and and uh
but when i tell you like guys i'm taking
monday off and i'm only grinding like
three or four hours four days a week but
i'm always doing it it's not like that
much right if it's not it doesn't really
it's not really that much but when you
have everything in place it just

[1:37:46]
have everything in place it just
you just your consistency just that your
hands and consistency just become they
just fall into place i think that's not
to say that there won't be times where i
will burn out for whatever reason and
i'm sure that that is going to happen at
some point and might do
and if that happens it happens and

[1:38:00]
and if that happens it happens and
breaks taking weeks off and months off
are important if you need to so just
like there's no shame in taking a month
off if you have to take them off yeah
absolutely so i want to segue into some
more random questions but things i've
been curious about as i've been speaking
uh one of them is what are some of the

[1:38:15]
uh one of them is what are some of the
books that have impacted your life the
most it could be in terms of your own
development working on yourself it could
be some of your favorite books that even
start enjoyable
all that yeah you've read recently
anything that comes to mind in terms of
impactful books
um so i'm really bad for reading any

[1:38:31]
um so i'm really bad for reading any
sort any sort of fiction um and i'm
always like this is something i would
like to work on a bit more i always read
to learn and all the reading i do is is
honestly about psychology and
psychotherapy i don't i've never read um
like a self-help book or anything like

[1:38:45]
like a self-help book or anything like
that um it's more like theory like
quite
dense uh
psychodynamic theory or relation like
modern relational theory um i guess the
number one that helped me understand
like this whole thing of being a poker

[1:39:01]
like this whole thing of being a poker
player and being an adult is completely
connected to every other day that has
come before
that day so your whole entire life is a
book by um
lavinia gomez and it's called object
it's like just called object relations

[1:39:15]
it's like just called object relations
theory an object relations theory is
just quite simply that
we are a product of
the our early relationships we are a
product of
uh how well we are handled as well as um
held in mind held and held in mind from

[1:39:31]
held in mind held and held in mind from
our caregivers and the impact that has
and also that there are ways to
replenish those relationships that
weren't perfect for us as as young as
young children
i would say that's probably my number
one my number one book and i read that

[1:39:45]
one my number one book and i read that
in my first year of training um about
yeah yeah
very nice yeah
other than that the other books i've
read are just like very kind of like
product childish books from when i was
younger yes i can relate to the
inspiration yeah i can relate to the
habit of only reading to learn as well i

[1:40:01]
habit of only reading to learn as well i
think that's a bit of a leak of mine
where
every time i'm trying to pick up a book
it's always like a productivity moment
my girlfriend's always like just don't
whine until i pick my book and start
reading but i'm always really like
trying to get information and learn
something but i think it's a good trade
overall but it could be balanced better
with some

[1:40:15]
with some
non-fiction reading to just let the mind
drift in taking some information
i think that yeah the last fiction book
i tried to read was um uh was it world
war zed
uh my girlfriend had it and i was just
like she was like similar to me like you

[1:40:31]
like she was like similar to me like you
just like why don't you just read
something to wind down you don't need to
either be like learning something it was
during when i was writing my
dissertation
and uh and i started reading it and i
kind of read like half and i was just
like i'm just so i'm thrilled by this
if i'm going to do this i'll watch a
movie or something like that it might i

[1:40:46]
movie or something like that it might i
don't know it seems a bit of a shame but
yeah yeah yeah so you've been playing
pokemon
reading is not your form of relaxation
say that again
reading is not your form of relaxation
then no it's not my form of relaxation

[1:41:01]
then no it's not my form of relaxation
walking going for walks being able to
not have any music in letting my my mind
just kind of go where it needs to go
that's my definite uh
that version of relaxation yeah i'm a
big fan of that as well walks for the
mind just let the mind drift and wonder

[1:41:15]
mind just let the mind drift and wonder
often whatever comes up comes up
so you've been playing poker 12 years
now and it sounds like your relationship
and enjoyment with poka is probably
healthier and better than ever
how could how was your
how would you say your relationship has
changed with poker come from that kid
getting into poker with your friends in

[1:41:30]
getting into poker with your friends in
london compared to where you are now
what's the kind of the biggest kind of
shift in your relationship with the game
um
it's a really good question it's a
really difficult question to ask

[1:41:46]
really difficult question to ask
to answer sorry
um
so how was my relationship to poker
change since i was since i was younger
i think it's just a lot healthier than
it was and it's a lot more it's a lot

[1:42:00]
it was and it's a lot more it's a lot
less uh
it's a lot more directional i think i
have a lot more direction for why i'm
doing it what i'm doing it for
um i think i'm yeah just a lot more
professional towards it um
i think probably the main thing is that

[1:42:15]
i think probably the main thing is that
like poker before filled uh filled a
i'm gonna want for a better word filled
a void that needed filling by something
and whether or not that was a video game
whether or not that was doing something
or whether or not that was playing poker
but poker was the thing that took
precedent over everything else

[1:42:31]
precedent over everything else
i think a lot more uh understanding of
what that void is and what is the
filling of that void what it's what
purpose it serves um
and that all goes back to what we talked
about earlier the idea of vulnerability
and and other things that may be

[1:42:45]
and and other things that may be
simmering below the surface so now
you're a lot more mindful of what you're
doing with poka your relationship with
pogo overall is
very like understood it sounds like you
know why you're doing poker to a degree
you might not know exactly some of the
deep rooted reasons but you're very
aware of why you're doing it and if you

[1:43:01]
aware of why you're doing it and if you
wanted to deal with the things you could
so yeah it sounds like a good evolution
as a person as well as a poker player
that you went through
so renee you have any questions that
you'd like to ask any questions that we
haven't covered any topics that you have
been on your mind in the last few
minutes

[1:43:18]
yeah he he mentioned uh something about
winners tilt
which is where he actually had the
opposite effect of
yeah what i think most people indeed
understand by winners tilt
i win as tilt by quitting sessions early

[1:43:30]
i win as tilt by quitting sessions early
it's like i come to a session to kind of
prove that i'm going to win or that i'm
good enough and then you know if i'm up
to rebinds it's like there's no more
upside in continuing grinding i can only
lose it back so then i quit i've done
this so many times man handling battles

[1:43:45]
this so many times man handling battles
three ended up three binds okay i quit
you know i beat them why why risk it and
especially i was not necessarily that
money driven
so i didn't see
a reason to continue basically
and i was curious like

[1:44:00]
and i was curious like
what are
some
bad habits that you still have up until
today that
you know
you think you shouldn't but you still it
still sometimes comes back

[1:44:16]
there definitely are some let me just
think for a second
one that comes to mind
is
carrying on playing if i'm winning

[1:44:30]
carrying on playing if i'm winning
um and also if i do check my graph mid
session which i sometimes do if i'm like
down a little bit
i might carry on to try get out of it
even if i'm down like
i don't know 20 big blinds or 50 big
blinds

[1:44:46]
blinds
i have to say though this happens
extremely rarely and actually
usually the reason the reason that it's
happening
is because something else is going on in
my life where i'm trying to kind of like

[1:45:00]
my life where i'm trying to kind of like
the needs ironing out and i'm trying to
iron it out by putting it into this
thing which is getting out of the hole
that's usually what the awareness of my
how my awareness comes into the
situation yeah
that's pretty interesting so it's like
you kind of want

[1:45:17]
you kind of want
okay that was adam bye bye adam
we have this connection
we have here
okay i don't really know what happened
but apparently he
that's okay

[1:45:31]
that's okay
all right we can just continue i'm sure
he can go back it's the same lane
yeah
um now i lost my train of thought you
were talking about
the winner still like if something is
still actually a form of it's actually

[1:45:45]
still actually a form of it's actually
still a form of winner still right a
little bit but it was interesting
because you said let's say for example
i don't feel satisfied
with something else in my life
i need that session to be a win in order
to to get that satisfaction that's kind

[1:46:01]
to to get that satisfaction that's kind
of what you're describing did i
understand yeah
yeah exactly otherwise i might feel like
there is another satisfaction stacked on
top of the original satisfaction and now
i have two dissatisfactions i don't know
if it's exactly as linear as that but
like there's something to be said for um

[1:46:17]
like there's something to be said for um
you go into a poker session with all the
feelings that you're carrying in and
sometimes playing poker whether or not
it means you've tilted a little bit or
whether or not it means you're trying to
kind of alleviate a certain feeling
it's kind of being replayed and replayed

[1:46:31]
it's kind of being replayed and replayed
out i think in a sense sometimes
yeah it's like you go in unconsciously
wanting to get something out of it yeah
like for you yours is more conscious you
say i want to go into the session i want
to win i want to have that feeling of
winning and then i'm going to get out of
there it might be you might have gone

[1:46:45]
there it might be you might have gone
into that session not knowing that you
needed that win and then it might become
apparent
just by how you're acting at the table
maybe you're three better yeah about how
you're acting when you or win or lose in
my case quitting early like now i
understand what what was going on and

[1:47:01]
understand what what was going on and
back in that time i didn't understand it
but not but now by reflecting i do
understand what's going on if you then
notice that you're
down do you notice
technically speaking that you start to
do things different for example if i'm
down i could maybe try to force things a

[1:47:16]
down i could maybe try to force things a
little bit more
i like i probably do
but i like to think i'm pretty
disciplined with my using my rng and
using ranges correctly and that kind of
thing like i don't deviate that kind of
stuff i i very much

[1:47:30]
stuff i i very much
i'm quite good at kind of uh leaving to
the side and noticing noticing the
desire without acting on the impulse
without being impulsive
having this understanding of
for example how emotions could influence

[1:47:45]
for example how emotions could influence
your playing cell technically this is
also a reason why
you already mentioned you decide to use
a very gto oriented approach with rngs
because you're very aware of certain
biases that can come in emotional states
that could influence decision this is
one of the reasons why you try to

[1:48:00]
one of the reasons why you try to
approach poker in that way
not so much actually i think i try and
play that approach because i think it's
the highest ev when you're playing good
players and that's simply it um and i
mean of course like
defending like
seven five suited versus a three bet

[1:48:15]
seven five suited versus a three bet
when you shouldn't do it but like you've
decided to do it because you're down 30
big blinds and you want to try win the
hand like you're not making a huge eevee
pump or whatever but like i think that
once you start allowing one thing then
you start adding more things and you
become more complacent and actually i
think complacency gets way more punished

[1:48:32]
think complacency gets way more punished
in the long run than
the consistency so i would just rather
consist i'm just looking looking to gain
eb and i just think playing more
consistently is better for that
yeah that's interesting because for
example you're referring to the five
seven suited call to three bet is

[1:48:45]
seven suited call to three bet is
probably you know uh
indifferent right whether you call or
fault but i think actually that if
you're in that state
probably the call is not going to be
very plus v because you're gonna you're
gonna force the action on later streets
yeah

[1:49:00]
yeah
for two streets maybe three streets
for example do you take in consideration
that
there's a lot of pre-flop spots where
playing playing three calling three
betting or folding a hand is basically
it's it's it's it's all okay right it's

[1:49:15]
it's it's it's it's all okay right it's
all gto you take in consideration that
for example
you are a little bit you're playing more
tables you're a little bit more fatigued
do you then take take in consideration
or the fact that you might not
you know be able to get the same ev as a

[1:49:31]
you know be able to get the same ev as a
solver and fold those hands more often
or would you just still rng it
i would still iron it because the way i
see it is if like i make 100 decisions
or maybe no more like 200 decisions in a
year where i kind of allow myself to
to

[1:49:45]
to
here we go
if i allow myself to call a certain hand
when i shouldn't then i'm going to be
over that year the ev is going to the ev
loss is going to be significant enough
for it to be unjustifiable
all right so yeah in the long term maybe
i then zoom in a little bit too much in

[1:50:00]
i then zoom in a little bit too much in
the moment itself because i would for
example definitely take in consideration
that when i'm fatigued to spot this like
a zero ev defense yeah okay i'm not
going to play post-flop
good enough given my current state that
i won't be able to realize the cv so

[1:50:16]
i won't be able to realize the cv so
actually the call would be negative ev
so yeah and that's exactly why i think
before i was saying like the more aware
you are of what's going on for you
before going into a session you're much
better positioned to set a session
length you're much better positioned to

[1:50:30]
length you're much better positioned to
kind of check in with yourself
mid-session to see if you need to quit
um and all that kind of stuff because i
whenever i go into a session i always
have a session length i always know how
long i'm going to play and then i'm
going to take a break and
sometimes i have like really good tables
i'll extend that a bit but i will really

[1:50:45]
i'll extend that a bit but i will really
prevent myself from playing fatigue for
the most part or at least try to of
course this isn't the perfect science we
can't we can't get it right all the time
but
always trying to think of it in terms of
evie and how much that fatigue would
influence that ev
yeah yeah so actually our schedules look

[1:51:01]
yeah yeah so actually our schedules look
quite similar i also indeed before i
play i'm going i play around three four
hours
maybe five i'll take a break somewhere
in the middle depending on the action if
the action is good all the time i'll
just make it a three to four hour
session if the action dies after two
hours i'll take a longer break and come

[1:51:16]
hours i'll take a longer break and come
back for two or three hours something
like that you know you're always trying
to to to indeed uh uh manage your
evening before you start playing you
you've something that came back multiple
times throughout this conversation is
how

[1:51:30]
how grateful you were for the fact that
you're a poker player right how
privileged you are to be in this
situation is that something you remind
yourself of before playing or
what do you do before playing do you
step into that or what is the routine
that you have
so i guess if i'm if i'm up for playing

[1:51:45]
so i guess if i'm if i'm up for playing
or if i'm if i'm neutral towards playing
i won't i won't but it will be when i
don't want to play um and usually the
way i do if i don't want to play is i
will uh if if the games are bad
and i'm not in the right mindset i will
choose to study instead of play so i

[1:52:00]
choose to study instead of play so i
will just not allow myself to play
and if the games are good i always just
say to myself like i'm going to be i'm
going to do the best i can with this
session that i'm going to play and
nothing more than that and nothing less
and some of the time i've kind of gone
gone in with the kind of the mantra of

[1:52:16]
gone in with the kind of the mantra of
like if i do one thing or two things i
give myself two strikes that i know are
minor cv or not the ev that i would have
done if i was feeling good i would just
quit my session and i will study instead
so i kind of set myself parameters
sometimes for that way of doing it

[1:52:31]
sometimes for that way of doing it
that's very interesting this flex
i get a flashback of like the first ever
poker book i read that suggested to keep
three chips next to you and if you make
three mistakes you quit your session
thank you i remember i would go to my
live casino and i would explain this to

[1:52:45]
live casino and i would explain this to
these people and i would have three
chips then i would lose the pot and then
someone said hey you won't chip away i
said no no i mean it wasn't a mistake
see all three you're the reason
that's so good
sorry you're the reason poker players
are so good now you were teaching them
from day one

[1:53:00]
from day one
yeah from day one actually i but i
actually do like uh
like that approach i think also
something that i picked up on what you
said is that you go in
with understanding you know this might
not be your best session but you're
still going to do it and i think

[1:53:15]
still going to do it and i think
aligning this expectation and in general
checking in with yourself before you
start playing like what is my mood and
how can i align my expectations for this
upcoming session it's huge huge for not
for preventing tilt right if i'm a
little bit fatigued
i might still say okay i'm going to play

[1:53:31]
i might still say okay i'm going to play
but you know probably a game is not
going to show up it will probably be
game maybe some c game mistakes even and
then i find it way more likely that
they'll actually end up grinding a good
session that if i would just go in and i
would not be aware of my state i would
get frustrated because i'm making b or c

[1:53:45]
get frustrated because i'm making b or c
game mistakes right so i thought that
was really an interesting point that i
think a lot of players should should
take from how you prepare for a session
just to check in and online
and it's really whether or not you
the checking in is whether or not you're
going to be able to offer yourself
compassion when you do play c game when

[1:54:01]
compassion when you do play c game when
you're expecting to play c game and if
you can't if you can't give yourself
compassion for playing c game and losing
five buttons because you might lose five
buy-ins at sea game and you may have run
still bad
and if you're then gonna beat yourself
up for having played

[1:54:15]
up for having played
don't play
like you need to be checking in the
compassion needs to be there from from
from the beginning to say like i'm not
at my best and is that good enough is
that going to be good enough for future
me who's going to be unhappy with the
result that comes out and if if you're
not going to be happy about it then then

[1:54:31]
not going to be happy about it then then
take a step back it kind of reminds me
of like when like if so like in therapy
like you have no choice but to see your
client if they're gonna come right
and you don't have a choice to say i'm
not feeling my best so i'm not gonna see
you but you i have to bring my best
version of myself that's gonna give as

[1:54:46]
version of myself that's gonna give as
much of myself that i can potentially
give to that person in that time it's no
different to that really you're just
going to kind of maybe you're going to
be like a little bit more reserved maybe
you're going to not give as many
interpretations but you're still going
to be there to absorb and to be with

[1:55:00]
to be there to absorb and to be with
what's going on yeah you're still going
to show up right you're going to show up
and try to do the best you can basically
um
going going forward looking ahead you
mentioned that the studying sessions
with clanty have motivated you you know
you've been moving up mistakes what are

[1:55:17]
you've been moving up mistakes what are
what what are some some aspirations for
mr benabit at the poker tables where can
we see you in the upcoming years
so i'm playing mostly on acr i'm playing
some stars playing a bit of 888 as well
i'm playing uh some uk betting sites as

[1:55:32]
i'm playing uh some uk betting sites as
well
um
and i'm bait and i'm going to be moving
to australia as well next year so i'm
hopefully going to be able to get on
ignition as well maybe gg as well i was
actually watching a video i think it was
earlier you were talking about um

[1:55:46]
earlier you were talking about um
playing on gg playing more high stakes
and i'm exactly the same as you i'm
dropping 1k and i'm now thinking
focusing on 2k to 5k that's pretty much
where i want to establish myself now
um so i'm doing a bit of reg battling at
2k and 3k on acr i don't feel

[1:56:01]
2k and 3k on acr i don't feel
comfortable battling on stars
because uh reg pool and also the lack of
rake and that kind of stuff
but that is the goal the goal is to be
established at high stakes
which feels weird to even say because

[1:56:15]
which feels weird to even say because
like
yeah i should have like stopped poker
like four years ago and i've kind of
just consistently increased and moved up
so it's quite uh quite weird hearing
myself say that
different experiences different
influences right i remember i had myself
as well it was explode 777 i don't maybe

[1:56:31]
as well it was explode 777 i don't maybe
you've played with him in the past when
i teamed up with him he was like okay
we're going to become the best and i was
just like you know i was just grinding
to pay
pay pay for my living you know i didn't
have higher aspirations i didn't didn't
really

[1:56:45]
really
feel like it was possible and maybe now
you're studying with clanty and you're
seeing your progression his progression
has made you believe that wait actually
we can we can become better right yeah
we can actually we can actually do this
for it it all starts with that right you
have to believe that you can do it yeah

[1:57:00]
have to believe that you can do it yeah
you have all the systems
you have the knowledge you have to
experience there's no reason why
you know you're gonna feel a couple
times probably when you when you shot
where you know this is perfectly in line
but in the end we're gonna make it
yeah and i mean like to be honest with
you it's been it's been a bit of a shock

[1:57:15]
you it's been it's been a bit of a shock
to the system like i might i i started
shot taking 2k properly like i don't
know a couple months ago or no more than
that like earlier on in the year and
straight off the bat i lost like 30
buy-ins at 2k like like that like i was
straight down 60k like immediately so

[1:57:32]
straight down 60k like immediately so
i'm like okay like here we go like we're
getting the baptism of fire and now what
do we do do we come back from this and
that kind of thing so
that is that in itself is an adjustment
period of the idea of swinging high
stakes swings

[1:57:45]
stakes swings
lower win rates and
harder games and stuff so
have you found that kind of battling how
do you think you're going to find those
kind of 50 100k downswings at 5k i mean
for me the the benefit is that i've
already experienced it like for me it's

[1:58:00]
already experienced it like for me it's
more like going back to where i was
so
yeah it's exactly what what i mentioned
right i'm i'm 100 confident i'm gonna
make it
i
have all the tools in place to find any
answer that i want

[1:58:15]
answer that i want
i know how to solve any problem
so yeah it's just a matter of time
basically that's how i see it uh
it becomes a problem when you start to
put you know especially with
uh
you probably experience this as well in
your blog or with me on twitch people

[1:58:31]
your blog or with me on twitch people
say yeah you know when can we expect you
next month we should set a goal january
but i'm not i'm not too much too much of
putting pressure on when right i'm
trying to show up the best the best i
can and when it happens when i'm ready
it's gonna happen basically yeah it

[1:58:46]
it's gonna happen basically yeah it
makes me honestly it genuinely makes me
really happy to hear other poker players
especially in our age bracket in the
poker world now actually aspiring to
kind of move up and not get stuck where
we were or that we're limited or that we
have to

[1:59:00]
have to
somehow become extinct
because i don't know about you but i
feel at the top of my game i feel
theoretically and cognitively and
psychologically at the top of my game
than i felt in my entire career
and that is a really exciting feeling

[1:59:15]
and that is a really exciting feeling
and really exciting to hear you say that
you feel the same way because it just
shows how like the sky's the limit
really we all thought poker was dying 11
years ago and actually apparently yeah
they said it 11 years ago they said it
eight years ago every year they say
poker is that every year you remember 10

[1:59:31]
poker is that every year you remember 10
years ago that they said that and look
at you know 10 years later moving up to
the ranks yeah and now i'm watching like
like stefan play lioness heads up
playing the streetest of poker and like
having this crushing red line completely

[1:59:45]
having this crushing red line completely
deviating everywhere and it's just like
what are we like are we going back in
time or like is this game way more
complicated than everyone thinks it is
and i think it's the latter
it is and i think the big big thing is
that we we talked about although in the
beginning
now you have the experience right

[2:00:01]
now you have the experience right
compared to that first year where you
wanted to try to try to play supernova
elite
it's just it's not possible you're not
ready for it you need a certain amount
of experience to handle everything that
the journey to becoming a high stakes
poker player is going to throw at you

[2:00:15]
poker player is going to throw at you
you just need experience
there's no way around it you cannot you
cannot cheat you cannot create a
shortcut also in terms of your
self-image you need to play a certain
amount of volume
at a certain stake for you to really
truly look at yourself deep inwards like
i belong here i am a 2k rack or i'm a 5k

[2:00:31]
i belong here i am a 2k rack or i'm a 5k
rack in order to really have that stance
that you are a 5k rack you need to prove
it to yourself right and for that you
need volume so you it takes time yeah
right else it's going to be fragile and
the small downswing will will will knock

[2:00:45]
the small downswing will will will knock
you off yeah
and actually there's something you
thought about and i was adam someone
linked me a video that you made i don't
know when you made it but it was about
ego between high-stakes players and
mistakes players and i was watching that
yesterday and actually just it really it
kind of resonates with what we're
talking about now like

[2:01:01]
talking about now like
i i
coming up i was like i need to prove
myself i need to be the best and i still
feel like i need to prove myself but i
need i feel like i need to be less vocal
about needing to prove myself it's like
i'm proving myself to myself now as
opposed to needing affirmation from

[2:01:16]
opposed to needing affirmation from
every other person that i come into
contact with in the poker world
it's also interesting what you mentioned
about other players moving down right we
experience sort of the same threat
it's like things are getting poker is
getting quote quote tougher people

[2:01:30]
getting quote quote tougher people
getting better
then it it all depends on your response
right it fires you up it fires me up
whereas other players are like okay now
in order to to win i have to move down
okay or they're like ah it's way too
challenging now 2k oh i went actually at
1k my hourly is higher so i play 1k they

[2:01:46]
1k my hourly is higher so i play 1k they
actually that's how they rationalize it
right not understanding that long term
that mentality will you know there's a
lot if you now go to the haunted house
there's a lot of axe higher six players
that are grinding there right now
because they had that mentality they

[2:02:00]
because they had that mentality they
didn't see it in the long term they
thought oh if i just move down one state
hey wait the money is way better here
that's a short term solution short term
maybe yes the next month you'll make
more money but long term
is a road downwards
that's so true and actually in adam's

[2:02:15]
that's so true and actually in adam's
question earlier he said he asked me
what was the difference between before
and now and that was exactly it it was
just being on the curve or just being
below the curve and i've realized in the
past four years that actually i can
continue to be above the curve if i

[2:02:31]
continue to be above the curve if i
choose to be and that was just a
complete revelation like that you can
you can be good and actually you can be
better than other people and that you
can still actually succeed the idea of
and being behind the curve oh my god
it's stressful
trying to keep up with the curve is is

[2:02:46]
trying to keep up with the curve is is
like tiring really tiring
uh takes out of you
really good stuff really good stuff so
what what are you excited for at the
moment the poker you guys are studying
you plenty what are you kind of working

[2:03:00]
you plenty what are you kind of working
on right now what what fires you up what
are you curious about uh what fires me
up is is uh money definitely improving
uh higher competition establishing
myself against players that have i've
always looked up to um not necessarily
being better than them just being able

[2:03:16]
being better than them just being able
to kind of play with them feels great um
and also just to continue to improve
really
um the goal is just to continue playing
poker until
i don't enjoy it anymore and while i
enjoy poker while i feel okay to do it

[2:03:30]
enjoy poker while i feel okay to do it
while i can make money while i can use
that money and freedom to do all the
other things i want to do in my life
like i'm gonna
i have a reason to keep studying and
keep getting good and keep and keep
remaining where i am so
that is the the on table goal um an off

[2:03:46]
that is the the on table goal um an off
table goal is that i'm going to be
moving to australia i'm going to be
closing down my therapy practice because
my license doesn't cover me in australia
so i'm going to take a year in oz if i
can get ever get out there with corona
um with my girlfriend and we're going to

[2:04:01]
um with my girlfriend and we're going to
play full-time poker
see how that goes figure out what i want
to do longer term and hopefully i'll
have an answer to that question in a
year's time basically
that sounds really good do you have any

[2:04:15]
that sounds really good do you have any
any final questions adam
