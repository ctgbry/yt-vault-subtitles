[00:00]
for people who like dwell on their
mistakes way too much let's say you made
a you actually did make a big mistake
and you got stacked and you say okay
that mistake was let's say it was a
blender like 10 big blinds and I think I

[00:15]
blender like 10 big blinds and I think I
think it's common if your win rate is
four big blinds uh people will think oh
well I just wiped out my win rate for
the next 250 hands just with that one
mistake so now I just I have to play
another 250 hands just to get get even

[00:30]
another 250 hands just to get get even
in expected value before it can start
making money that's not actually how it
works but I do resonate a lot with what
you said
about um tying yourself Worth to your
results and how that can really lead to

[00:46]
results and how that can really lead to
a lot of performance
anxiety the amount that you tie yourself
worth to you know how good of a poker
player you are is proportional to how
much stress you are going to experience

[01:01]
much stress you are going to experience
when you
lose
so I I think it's very good to recognize
that and that has helped me a lot with
my performance anxiety too is just
really establishing that this one

[01:15]
really establishing that this one
session whatever the results are it
doesn't make me any better or worse of a
poker player even though my monkey brain
really wants to say that a winning day
is a good day and a losing day is a bad
day and understanding of
variance um can help with this a lot too

[01:31]
variance um can help with this a lot too
is just really establishing in your
brain that whatever the results of this
session are it's basically just noise
you've got maybe a 55% chance of winning
and a 45% chance of losing and so it
doesn't really make any sense to tie

[01:47]
doesn't really make any sense to tie
yourself Worth to that in fact it's
actually very stressful and unproductive
to do that um I will say that the sort
of doubt and the stress can be
productive like you said it seems like
you understand understand that this is a

[02:01]
you understand understand that this is a
motivating factor for you to improve and
so what is the alternative like you know
if obviously it sucks that this is the
way our brains work that we have to feel
these negative emotions in order to
stimulate growth but if the alternative

[02:17]
stimulate growth but if the alternative
is just that you never doubt yourself or
any plays that you make and you just
like basically stagnate and never get
any better that's not good either so I
think a lot of players exist on this
spectrum I've got some players who

[02:30]
spectrum I've got some players who
who are my students who they can just
Crush
volume but they also don't seem to have
as much attention to detail and they're
not really as good at fixing leaks
typically as the people on the other end

[02:45]
typically as the people on the other end
of the spectrum who don't play as much
volume but focus on studying a lot and
they have a much stronger attention to
detail and they're always questioning
their actions so I think there's a sweet
spot and if you're if you're on on

[03:00]
spot and if you're if you're on on
either end of the spectrum too much I
think you should do some work to get
closer to the
metal I definitely feel
like when I for example I I I studied a
lot in poker in in my cfp for I think

[03:17]
lot in poker in in my cfp for I think
about two years after that when I
started to play because I became so
conscious of all the possibilities and
that the correct quote answer was really
dependent on either this either that I
remember when I would play it was so

[03:31]
remember when I would play it was so
overwhelming in terms of well I see this
spot well I can do this I can do that
well that this would be the best play
depending on this this I basically I
sort of it sounds a bit weird but I sort
of Knew Too Much and therefore I knew
actually nothing in terms of I couldn't

[03:45]
actually nothing in terms of I couldn't
perform because there was just way too
much stuff going on inside my head so
sort of also accepting and and we will
actually get I want to actually talk
about this topic in in a second like
defining what your strategy is and sort
of of deciding on one route that you're

[04:02]
of of deciding on one route that you're
going to take instead of being in a
situation well well there's various
routes that I can take like off off off
game work I think it has definitely
benefits because you're very open-minded
and you can look at various
possibilities so you will see lines or

[04:16]
possibilities so you will see lines or
strategies that other person might not
see but if you don't decide before you
play what your extra strateg is going to
be it can bite you in the ass when you
start playing I think also what you
mentioned is interesting like players
who have more I for

[04:32]
who have more I for
detail let's say for example you play a
session of two hours you have two of
your students what both that you just
described one guy might have identified
five mistakes or yeah one have identify

[04:45]
five mistakes or yeah one have identify
five mistakes where the other one who
has more attention to detail might have
identified 15 and maybe after two hours
he's like well I've identified 15
mistakes I want to quit my session I
want to look at those mistakes where the
other guys just like well only made five
mistakes and they were not so big so he
can just basically continue playing do

[05:01]
can just basically continue playing do
do do you feel like that's something
that could be going
on yeah and honestly I think probably
the people who are easier on themselves
have better chances of being successful

[05:15]
have better chances of being successful
in poker because a lot of the success in
poker just comes from
longevity and as long as there are
recreationals in your game you're going
to be profitable in that game like like
you said you know you feel
self-conscious about playing if you
didn't sleep well the night before um

[05:33]
didn't sleep well the night before um
probably that doesn't have as big of an
impact if you're sitting at a table with
one recreational player you're probably
gonna be profitable in that game I don't
think I don't know what your your win
rate is Renee but I if let's say it's

[05:46]
rate is Renee but I if let's say it's
like seven big blinds per 100 or eight
big blinds per 100 I don't think it's
going to go negative uh down to three
negative three big blinds for 100 just
because you didn't sleep well that night
sounds like it sounds like exactly what
Jared tendler told me back then he says

[06:00]
Jared tendler told me back then he says
no you have to implement he said you see
things too black as white you either say
that you're a Crusher or you're a losing
player there's something in the middle
as well he told
me yeah defit but the interesting point
he also said he said so you're saying
that because you slap bad that you're

[06:15]
that because you slap bad that you're
not going to perform well but every time
you sleep B you don't play how do you
know that you're going to perform bad if
you never play when you when you don't
sleep and I was like ah good point so I
remember it was the same for example
let's say a holiday break and afterward

[06:31]
let's say a holiday break and afterward
you come back I would need like a week
at least to few like a week of sort of
preparation to feel like okay I can I
can perform again right and again he
said the same thing how do you know he
actually said and this is actually good

[06:45]
actually said and this is actually good
advice for people listening as well when
you come back for your holidays actually
the perfect time to just jump in and see
what your C game looks like because they
will point you out exactly the most uh
important areas for your game to improve
so I made a very big mind shift both in
the sleep at some point and also with

[07:00]
the sleep at some point and also with
the breaks I would jump in aligning
expectations majorly important because
if you expect to play your A game guess
what you're going to get frustrated
because most likely you're not whereas
if you expect to play your C game you
actually might be surprised that you

[07:15]
actually might be surprised that you
might actually start playing your aame
it's your expectation going in will
really determine how how your session is
going to be if you're going to say
listen I'm going to be very Rusty I
expect the minimum and the minimum comes
up it's like well that was expected if
you perform a little bit better than the
minimum like oh well I'm pleasantly

[07:31]
minimum like oh well I'm pleasantly
surprised with how things went today uh
so I think aligning expectations is very
important and another thing that I think
is very important that helped me a lot
was instead of tracking outcome like you
said obviously detaching yourself worth
from the results very important which

[07:47]
from the results very important which
actually also maybe you can also relate
to this uh I usually ask this El as
coaches especially when I started to get
coaching and start to go a bit more in
the public I suddenly this is why I said
M problems somehow they always chase me
every time a situation Chang a new

[08:01]
every time a situation Chang a new
problem comes up it's very annoying but
so I started to put myself out there
just like you right as a coach and then
suddenly I started to notice that if I
would be on a down swing it would
suddenly influence me way more because I
felt like I needed to win to have

[08:17]
felt like I needed to win to have
credibility and that kind of became like
a self-fulfilling prophecy because like
oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] I haven't been winning
over the last 20K hands 40K hands
whatever I'm not running so well and
then I wanted I started to play and I
wanted to win because the winning was

[08:31]
wanted to win because the winning was
tied to sort of my credibility as a
coach so then what happens well your
your performance pressure increases
right your performance anxiety before
you jump in your session increases and
then it becomes a self-filling prophecy
because you're going to choke because
the winning becomes too important to you

[08:46]
the winning becomes too important to you
so as you can see mental game it's
annoying thing uh but what I wanted to
say and now I'll hand it over to you so
instead of tracking your results but
like I said I found this more easily
when it was just me because the outer
world if I show a graph where I break

[09:02]
world if I show a graph where I break
even in 100K hands everyone is going to
be like and if I say variant then
everyone's you just suck blah blah blah
how can you coach or at least that's the
story that you tell in your head
obviously the reality is is way
different but to instead of results

[09:16]
different but to instead of results
track like certain kpis like you already
mentioned right I do exactly the same I
look at my game I identify certain leaks
I'll write like stat goals I usually
like to give like bronze silver gold so
let's say my River fold is 55 I want to

[09:31]
let's say my River fold is 55 I want to
get it to 50 I write down okay it's now
55 the aim is 50 that's the gold aim
I'll give 51 for silver and 52 for
bronze or something I'll do that for all
the stats and then after my session I'll
load in a filter face riverb so after my

[09:47]
load in a filter face riverb so after my
session I'll look at these hands because
like you cannot look at River fold after
your session because there's that say
you played 1 thousand hands River fold
says nothing so after the session I'll
look at the actual hands to see if I'm
applying it correctly and then after the

[10:00]
applying it correctly and then after the
month I will look at my actual stat and
that way if you have certain Focus point
for your session and after your session
is done you just evaluate your session
or how your session wents based on did I
do what I set out to do did I focus on
my focus points if the answer is yes

[10:15]
my focus points if the answer is yes
then who cares about the short-term
result of the session but you need to
track something I feel like if you don't
track epis or you don't look at your
results yeah you're going to want to see
something right and then most people
grab for the grab for the graph and then

[10:30]
grab for the grab for the graph and then
basically you're putting how you've done
you're putting in the hands of the poker
gods in the short-term variants that
seems like a
prom yeah that's a really good point and
one other mindset shift that I've used
for people who

[10:46]
for people who
like dwell on their mistakes way too
much um I think it's common like let's
say you sit down for a session and you
get stacked really early in the session
and let's say you made a you actually
did make a big mistake and you got
stacked and you you say okay that

[11:05]
stacked and you you say okay that
mistake was let's say it was a blunder
like 10 big
blinds and I think I think it's common
if your win rate is four big blinds per

[11:16]
if your win rate is four big blinds per
100 uh people will think oh well I just
wiped out my win rate for the next 250
hands just with that one mistake so now
I just I have to play another 250 hands
just to get even in expected value
before it can start making money that's

[11:31]
before it can start making money that's
not actually how it works your win
rate your your mistakes that you have
made historically are built into your
win rate already so if your win rate is
four that is the sum of all of the good

[11:45]
four that is the sum of all of the good
plays you've made and the bad plays that
you've made so I think it's a lot more
productive to go into your session
understanding that nobody plays
perfectly and that you are going to make
a lot of mistakes and that you have made
mistakes Mes in the past so you're going

[12:00]
mistakes Mes in the past so you're going
to continue probably to make mistakes
the only thing that you can really try
to do is just make smaller mistakes and
fewer mistakes in the
future um but you're you're always going
to make mistakes and the fact that you
make a mistake in a session is not going

[12:16]
make a mistake in a session is not going
to be the thing that turns you from a
winning player into a losing player and
the absolute worst thing that can happen
for your EV if you're a winning player
is that you get knocked out of the game
completely because of these mindset

[12:31]
completely because of these mindset
leaks like you burn out and you just
stop playing well now your EV just went
from eight big blinds to zero and that's
actually the worst thing that could
happen the odds that you're going to be
losing in games unless you have really

[12:45]
losing in games unless you have really
poor game selection are very very low um
maybe you'll go from eight to five or
six if you're playing on a bad day or at
a time where you don't really feel like
you should you can be playing your aame
um but yeah longevity is just is super

[13:02]
um but yeah longevity is just is super
important and the ability to just put in
that volume because the fact is there
are recreationals playing and there's a
lot of free money floating around and
you a major part of your job as a poker
player is to just be there to to get

[13:18]
player is to just be there to to get
that money that free money when it's
there just show and to to not go crazy
in the
[Music]
process
