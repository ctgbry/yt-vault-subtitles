[00:00]
and I've actually won like four
tournaments that summer which was kind
of insane yeah it was like the $400 at
the at the win for like 30k followed by
like a $600 at the finition for like
40K 1K at definition for like 100k and

[00:18]
40K 1K at definition for like 100k and
then uh the tag team uh event uh for
world for WP bracet with two of my good
friends which was also very very cool
very nice

[00:30]
very nice
and I even had like the biggest Final
Table of my life back then at least
until that moment it was like a 1.6k
event at the win uh with like 500k for
first and I got uh like I got it in like

[00:45]
first and I got uh like I got it in like
Ace Jack suited against ace4 suited or
something and busted ninth and I
remember like this was a big uh a big
moment in my mental career because I
remember like basically what happens in
mtts I think is most people people they

[01:00]
mtts I think is most people people they
run deep and then they have uh like
let's say you're like one out of 20 in a
big tournament and then you have like
this huge expectation you are already
dreaming of like ah like there is like
100k 200k 1 million up top doesn't
matter and you have that amount in your

[01:16]
matter and you have that amount in your
mind already you're thinking about it
some it may affect their games some it
doesn't but I think as long as you have
that expectation and then realistically
you can just bust two hours after that
or like three hands later um that can be

[01:31]
or like three hands later um that can be
really really painful and I remember
like that final table even though it was
followed by basically me going to Vegas
and P Xing my bankroll or something
during that trip um I still I was so

[01:45]
during that trip um I still I was so
disappointed like I remember I basically
became sick it was like the last day of
my Vegas trip and I I had to like pack
and uh uh do all those kinds of
arrangements before my flight and I
remember I was just lying sick in bed

[02:00]
remember I was just lying sick in bed
just couldn't get up and maybe I was
just getting the flu but I think it had
also something to do with just being
really really disappointment like even
though it was like still a great result
I think it was like 50k from a 1.6k

[02:15]
I think it was like 50k from a 1.6k
tournament but at the moment you just
feel like somebody crushed your soul I
don't know um so this was a very very
big experience for me because ever since
I've been really really careful with
having expectations I think ever since
basically never happened like I've had

[02:31]
basically never happened like I've had
so many
differ uh like I remember being like one
out of 10 in a big live MTT with like
40% of chips and busting ninth and not
even like pting just getting cooled um
and I was so okay with it like I was

[02:45]
and I was so okay with it like I was
obvious obviously disappointed but like
now I just realized these things happen
and it's just a part of the experience
and there is not much you can do about
it and also going back to what I said
before I think MTT guys they need to you
know they need to acknowledge the pain

[03:00]
know they need to acknowledge the pain
like there is so much pain to it so
let's say you sit down and you play a
cash game and let's say a cash game guy
is having a down swing losing like 30
binds 50 binds I don't know it can be
pretty painful I'm not saying you're not
going to have rough moments but if

[03:16]
going to have rough moments but if
you're an MTT guy and you're losing 500
binds or like you're losing for like one
or two years this is like this is very
painful and this is one of the reasons
why I left mtts um so basically what

[03:30]
why I left mtts um so basically what
happened
is uh back then I was uh thinking I want
to play mostly live because I felt like
live mtts are so good and I like like
going traveling to many stops um and I

[03:46]
going traveling to many stops um and I
was doing really well basically I I
after that Vegas trip I went to
Cyprus uh there is a cool place called
Merit and I won the main event basically
back to back like two trips in a row for
like

[04:00]
like
160 180k each um which is again like
kind of insane an insane run um and yeah
basically then coid
happens and no more life stops so I was

[04:15]
happens and no more life stops so I was
kind of not sure what to do but then
online poker boomed so I was again
playing online
mtts and was doing okay I think I have I
had a solid year at coid but then uh I
realized like this is not working like I

[04:32]
realized like this is not working like I
don't enjoy the online streets as much
anymore uh especially when it means uh I
mean the online mty streets especially
when it means going to sleep like with

[04:45]
when it means going to sleep like with
my Israeli time zone it means like you
have to go to sleep at like 5 6 7 8 a.m.
every day if you want to grind it and
for me it was not sustainable because it
basically would [ __ ] my life um I was
trying to get like a routine going of

[05:00]
trying to get like a routine going of
like just leaving like I'm not saying
like waking up 6:00 a.m. but at least
you know waking up like 11:00 a.m. or
like 12 something like that and being
able to uh to have a social life being
able to I don't know uh doing some stuff

[05:15]
able to I don't know uh doing some stuff
other than studying and playing and it
was very hard so I was thinking H maybe
I could uh maybe I could try something
else maybe I can try to get into Cash
games and then uh uh a a mutual friend

[05:32]
games and then uh uh a a mutual friend
connected me to URI pel uh which uh
you've already talk to and
basically
um him and a great group of coaches uh

[05:47]
um him and a great group of coaches uh
shifted my game from playing I wasn't
really a beginner because I started
playing like I already had a lot of
money and experience and I um basically
started playing like 1K when I moved to
cash games like

[06:00]
cash games like
510 and I was doing already pretty well
um playing those games and then what
happens is my game just shifted really
quickly uh from playing those games to
like playing like taking a shot at 5K on

[06:16]
like playing like taking a shot at 5K on
GG and then having taken a shot at 5K
and seeing that things are going well
for one two three months I said okay I
mean usually what happens in Icees is
there is a big gap between the mid

[06:30]
there is a big gap between the mid
Stakes to high stakes so if you play 510
or 1020 it's really hard to go up to
play 5K because what happens is there
are first of all there is a lot less
action in 2550 compared to like 510 and

[06:45]
action in 2550 compared to like 510 and
second the games are much tougher um
also because there's a lot less action
then people play fewer tables they are
much more focused whereas if you play 5
10 people maybe they play especially on
GG they they could play like 10 to 15

[07:00]
GG they they could play like 10 to 15
tables or something to grind the rate
back stuff or whatever and I think it's
it's much ster to play the harder game
and then this Gap is really hard to uh
to go through and for me I don't know it

[07:16]
to go through and for me I don't know it
kind of I've always been on the side of
like I saidan but yeah like at that
point I'm already taking like uh smart
shot taking I I would say because I had
a lot of money from

[07:30]
a lot of money from
mtts I'm I I just was wasn't sure that I
have the skill that is required U but
once I figure out that I do then
basically when you play the high stakes
then often 2550 and 5100 it's almost the
same lineup uh so you just then I

[07:47]
same lineup uh so you just then I
started ping 5100 and I basically
thought that my results were even better
because it's the same lineup but uh The
Rake is lower and then there would be
like a 100 200 game uh so when Whenever
there was a really good spot I started

[08:00]
there was a really good spot I started
playing those games and then I realized
that again like the results just get
better because often it's it's like a
very similar lineup but it's uh it's
much lower rake um and I guess 100 200

[08:16]
much lower rake um and I guess 100 200
is exactly the cut off point where the
games become start to become much
tougher because some of the guys who
play 5K regularly uh don't want to play
uh but people who like the the the very
top guys that they they do want to play

[08:31]
top guys that they they do want to play
so like if they see there is some 20K or
40K action going on regularly they would
just show up uh they would they would
start showing up every day which doesn't
always happen um so yeah and then it
picked that uh it basic I've had like a

[08:46]
picked that uh it basic I've had like a
really good year and it picked with like
the Imagine King games at the end of
2021 basically uh if yeah I'll just say
he like some kind of Chinese guy who
showed up and he started playing uh 2550

[09:00]
showed up and he started playing uh 2550
like three tables and then he moved up
to 5100 and then 10000 200 400 I think
he even played like one or two sessions
of higher than that but most of the
games were like uh 20K and
40K and uh when it was 4 dek it was

[09:16]
40K and uh when it was 4 dek it was
basically really tough lineups basically
uh the same guys almost show up every
day uh you could see like Kevin lonus um
ignasio

[09:31]
ignasio
dudy um yeah like David Jones darl like
literally all of the all of the very top
guys they would just show up every day
like Marcus Len um there would be like
uh yeah it would be like uh six table

[09:47]
uh yeah it would be like uh six table
with almost uh the same lineup um and
then it was very it was very nice
because even though we had this wreck at
the table it was still very hard because

[10:00]
the table it was still very hard because
the rake is still uh it's already much
lower but it's still if you compare it
to different sides it's it was still
pretty high um and you're playing like
literally the best players in the world
so I I I actually I I think I also ran

[10:16]
so I I I actually I I think I also ran
pretty hot during that like one two
months but I think I was uh probably at
the top of my G of my game back then
just being really really sharp uh
studying and being very consistent and I
also I think I have had like a really

[10:30]
also I think I have had like a really
good routine um during that times uh so
yeah I was super happy um to be able to
yeah to do
[Music]

[10:46]
[Music]
that
