wait i cannot reload anymore i can
already see the title
streamer going broke on stream
that's a good title
do you want to know what is inside the
mechanics of poker program go over to
the site where you can watch a free
one hour demo welcome guys
to the wacko show stream
we're gonna start off the hand straight
away with a little three bet
which gets true while we face small c
bet
he's gone
hmm
[Music]
hmm
this one's a little bit close
actually probably just a fault but i
like my hand more than like king jack
with the jack of clubs or something
ah we ship a nice little pot and this is
actually what i thought that he could be
barreling certain hands that are
you could say a little bit mergy that
are often going to check behind the
river because he obviously thought he
had some showdown value versus like king
queen or something with a with a club
here
this hand's actually quite i can call i
can race
actually gonna go for a little check
race here i think that's fine
this looks maybe a little bit crazy but
i think this is okay
to do this with the hearts and with the
spades
he calls i think
i think what can we do
i think i'm gonna jam the turn this is
not really a thing but
we ship it in nice little pot all right
all right all right all right this is
who would have won that pot guys who
would have won that pot here we flopped
the seven gonna call the flop
is interesting i should love
i don't think i should be bluffing a
pear i'm a little bit tempted with this
one though
i wish i would have better turner then
we would have had a bigger pot now
now i think overbet is probably the
correct strategy
how do you get the bottles on the table
actually i think we have something like
what's the command there's a comment i
think is it like this caption
no there is a comment it's starscaption
do we got a call that's good you know
sometimes bad sometimes check this hand
decide to now go for
that
and basically what i changed now is i
have mult
there's multiple objectives with what
i'm trying to do
i have multiple goals
and it's no longer that when i reach
when i play uh 5k 10k again
that after that
basically that's gonna be it because
obviously i have pokemission as well and
we're keeping growing the brand so
there's a lot of stuff going on
there's also like you could say some
external accountability if you're a
coach a streamer
you make content you know it's important
that
you yourself also know what you're doing
basically
this one is quite interesting he's
saying basically that he has a very
strong hand
okay show it yes king seven okay gg
now i have to reload my star my 888
account it looks like
so that was an expensive hero call
i can already see the title streamer
going broke on stream
that's a good title it's a good
clickbait guys it's good clickbait
wait i cannot reload anymore
also a good quote to now add it in the
beginning of
the youtube video when is the next 2009
zoom stream
probably never going to happen what
bluff would you have on the river
7 on the 97 offhand me my blood would
mainly be hence
would have to be hands like king 10
queen 10 type of holdings
we got a subscriber shout out to mr acid
rain for subscribing
much appreciated my friend
we face a razor with the seven four
i think we have a call
i don't like this donk
i don't like my sizing that much could
have thought about this a little bit
more
i would have liked to bet a little bit
bigger i think
where's the gem and basically it was
gonna get
hard yeah i definitely dislike the way i
played this hand
but hey we're in this situation now
thing is eight or nines that's a very
likely hand
i played his hand very badly
played his hand very badly
played his hand very badly with
the king of clubs i'm gonna call without
i wouldn't call
obviously but i think without i should
probably still call
a fold versus three quarters
interesting turn there's a block
i don't mind having a raising range here
or maybe i'm inventing that now because
i have king jack and i feel like raising
king queen with the king with a club
definitely raising this one i'm not sure
don't have a heart please i guess we
have to call
we're happy about it [ __ ] with queens
okay pg
decent situation for us
and we pink thank you very much sir
[Music]
actually going actually some people have
joined me
here at the 2k table we have a nice
little almost 8k stack
that i would like to keep so i'm gonna
tell these guys to make a new
as these guys are pretty good and we're
not playing that great
i don't think this is a great time
to play a little three-handed versus
these guys i'll give myself the chicken
song
you give it to other people you should
sometimes give to yourself face a
checker with sixes
you don't mind making a little stop just
see what develops
i'll check the turn and check the river
and hope to sometimes ran off ace king
or something
open up the queen jack gonna see that
the flop
going to turn this interesting
block to turn i would say
maybe a little bit loose
could be a little bit loose
and this this sucks kind of all the way
i think blocking again is the solution
now
but not sure
not sure today we get paid off twice
by jack 10 jack eight okay okay thank
you very much sir
in that case in this case i like my bet
i like this bed a lot too this is really
really kind of sexy
check check check again
there's delay definitely calling
we have a nice little recreational
joining the table and that's what we're
talking about
okay we got the in-game reminder take a
couple of deep breaths
while he thinks about it don't check
come on my friend
get king jack of spades so he gave up
the river
a little bit chicken little chicken
[Music]
ah let's try a little forward versus mr
big celia why not
you in the mood
wondered seabed here oh cut-off and kind
of a hard spot to play
there's ep empty this high-end is quite
easy versus button as well but first
cutoff
we decided to go for the little double
barrel of his mr big ceiling he folded
he folded
made another nice little uh a little
better i like this bed a lot too this is
really
really kind of sexy hey sexy very sexy
thank you
but i do guys i bring i make poker sexy
poker ambition poker made to be sexy
making poker sexy again poker ambition
what do you think is a good what do you
guys think is a good uh
it's a good quote there while we make
dupe
here i'm gonna go for a big
like to make a small little barrel small
little barrel
a little barrel is often smaller
i'm not gonna bet the river
that's ten percent of the river okay i
like it shout out to mr silvia
i like this bed a lot too this is really
really kind of sexy
i'm going to fold like a little girl
guys i'm followed like a little girl
draw a little donkey donkey donkey
donkey donkey for the stream fence
i go for a little pot bet
hey james we have a call is 34
suited what that ain't good hey my
friend thank you very much
thank you very much sir but then this is
actually important hand to win guys
come on we're going to go in i am lucky
lucky
okay folks we take it we take it we'll
take it oh he turned two pair here the
guy limped on the button
we check out the flop and he
and he's gonna keep on calling
other positions single response really
complicated yeah so
[Music]
no worries guys i'll go take a look at
it
and make a great little masterclass my
little car with the 10 jack suited on
the button
we flop decent there's a little bet
going to make a little rate
because
definitely barreling the turn
pot that's what we're going for pot
basically we get the cleanest run out
ever
so yeah i don't think there's much else
to do than
jam jamming is maybe a little bit too
much
you couldn't find the blast i also
couldn't find the bluffs
because all of my blobs are probably
gonna want to give up on the river
because a lot of my blossom would be
like i don't know bucket threes with a
heart or something
if i had a seven like seven six suited
i'm probably gonna check the river so
it's in
it's an interesting spot so we're gonna
call it a day guys i wanna thank you
