[00:02]
is this gonna be the pathway tiki is
gonna give us a stack come on tiki front
bed dunk
pot or something i don't know
what what what

[00:28]
what

[00:33]
it's not a slow right because there's
still someone behind just saying
oh he comes with ace king what a dream
[ __ ] scenario this is guys
oh my god oh my

[00:46]
oh my god oh my
god

the site where you can watch a
free one hour demo how are you guys all
doing
welcome back to another episode of the
wacko show
where me the weko is going to play some
poker
jack then off will three bet some of the

[01:15]
jack then off will three bet some of the
time like 50 50.
and this board i will dunk with some of
the time
so why not now why not why not
could also check race good good long bet

[01:30]
could also check race good good long bet
kind of depends on uh
kind of depends on a couple of things
this hand
what should i do with this hand got a
big

[01:45]
big
a hundred percent sure
because mainly they are on the turn i
usually like splitting between very big
and very small but
this hand particularly felt a little bit
like a three-quarters
i think actually the majority likes to

[02:00]
i think actually the majority likes to
see me play correct
then having a little bit more of an
aggressive twitch rng
running
this three bet is quite big

[02:18]
it's close i'm gonna call but there's
that sizing
you know hi mr wacko hello sir
oh wait this is actually on the other
table hi there sir

[02:31]
table hi there sir
hi there sir
good luck
oh we face a small barrel here i think
we have to call because we have a pair
it's not really our preferred hand to
call
much rather have nine eight five six

[02:48]
much rather have nine eight five six
and here know james the river i think
i'm just gonna start off with the fault
i don't really know who this guy is but
um
yeah this is gonna start off with the

[03:00]
yeah this is gonna start off with the
fault what can i say now only have to
make them uh
yeah shareable with you guys
which means also translating oh wait
actually there was another
uh another requirement for joining the

[03:16]
uh another requirement for joining the
cfp program
or at least when it was still open that
was that you have to speak dutch
so yeah but i'm sure that's also not a
problem right
this hand quite close

[03:32]
this hand quite close
gonna go for a bet but you don't really
want to get check race but
if he does you know so be it

[03:46]
if he does you know so be it
results i think one of these hands that
has to be
how many calls think in general
your flush draws not really a great hand
to be bluffing same
with your jack 10 in general as you're

[04:00]
with your jack 10 in general as you're
blocking jackson tents so i'm just going
to give up
air phase erase on the flop
i'm going to call this race

[04:22]
there's a barrel here

[04:32]
let me give the boy some credit
i mean i'm in a given credit mood guys
i'm in a given credit mood guys
unbelievable
who would have thought that so if you

[04:45]
who would have thought that so if you
are for example a station
high five to other stations out there
usually when we think
it's a good spot to call we have to
realize that we tend to think a lot of
spots are good spots recall
so you know it's probably you know

[05:00]
so you know it's probably you know
our feeling of something being a good
spot to call minus a little bit
right it's kind of the
equation hopefully over here with the 89

[05:18]
and it goes that's an interesting turn
that is an interesting turn

[05:31]
actually going to check the lowest
straight i think actually that's a fine
strategy
especially if i didn't have a heart i do
have a heart so that will lead me
usually to do a little bit more betting
well in general this kind of spots
checking back like your lowest straight
is a valid

[05:46]
is a valid
valid plate and a river i'm going to bet
er wacko i used to see how hard you were
battling versus sing karma on his
youtube you put him in difficult
situations every hand
well uh happy to hear that that's
usually my uh objective

[06:02]
usually my uh objective
get a fold there for mr bangalore ice
poker not just easy
no that's good because if poke was easy
guys everyone would do it and we
wouldn't be able to make money out of it
who in your estimation estimate has the

[06:15]
who in your estimation estimate has the
greatest digestion
you mean stomach digestion what are we
talking about digestion
digestion digestion digestion digestion
i don't really understand what you mean
with digestion my friend

[06:30]
i don't understand what you mean with
digestion

[06:53]
a little bit of a knitty check back
there but we're playing np versus small
blind
that jack's definitely betting

[07:02]
that jack's definitely betting
so basically you guys are asking the
same question because you say
who has the best digestion okay who
got enough stay in the digestion world
and who's the best i've never seen
player well i would say the best
five-year-old zoom player has the best
digestion

[07:18]
this one is
close-ish i'm gonna go for a barrel i
don't really know much about him but

[07:31]
don't really know much about him but
okay and get the czech memories god damn
it
god damn it
[Music]
okay okay 10

[07:47]
check check mr banker rush hey he checks
thank you
king seven
he did have a good hand or at least he
was like

[08:00]
was like
look it looks pretty i don't mind
pumping up the pot a little bit
but i didn't get there yet so let's not
pump it up too much
that's the type of hand that he had
i'm going to call the flop

[08:15]
and we have quite a brilliant oh we have
a brilliant here as well
i actually wanted to use the charlie and
this is lucky lucky let's go
that's a fly strap faster is good and
here we're just going to
let the keep keep the guy on barreling
while my webcam somehow

[08:31]
while my webcam somehow
does something very weird this is a
special moment guys come on
let's let's stay focused stay focused
kemmy come on
let's stay focused here let's stay
focused god damn it
it's a bad river huh

[08:46]
it's a bad river huh
i don't think i should bet too big
what happened to my cam guys [ __ ]

[09:03]
future stream equity is a concept that
is getting more and more understood it
applies both to the streamer and the
opponent to different degrees depending
on who's watching
next level stuff sir

[09:17]
you do make sure we all stay sharp here
ie this this is the time charlie
oh charlie where
are you i'm lucky

[09:47]
we also have open enders we don't block
the 89
suited oh my god that is the street
that is the straight right there guys

[10:03]
convincing sizing i think i'm just gonna
call
can i just call actually

[10:26]
[Music]
there's a four bed here i'm going to

[10:31]
there's a four bed here i'm going to
call this and some of the time
15 15 is quite alone
let's let's see what we can do

[10:51]
like the guy with the jack nine he's not
that big of a fish from what i recall
it's a little bit more of the knittier
side

[11:01]
side
but i'm curious what you guys think i'm
gonna check all this
try an ace should be good most of the

[11:16]
try an ace should be good most of the
time
in here x we have aces we limped check
check turn check again
and now the guy starts over betting
which is quite interesting
this one i am raising

[11:34]
the other hand is actually also
interesting i will raise this in a
second
he faces now 10 i think i should
probably raise his hand now

[11:47]
days i'm raising i'm just thinking about
it for a little while it's a bit of a
funky spot
this one yeah i think i should probably
now race i'm gonna go for a small race
with my exact holding

[12:11]
with my exact holding
when it calls i think we should just bet

[12:20]
and me my heart is puking
and here yeah i think we should just now
jam and hope
that that's kind of the strategy

[12:36]
heaven false
uh i think all we can do here is call

[12:47]
uh i think all we can do here is call
let's call guys front gem from front gem
hearts let's go
oh i still say it
should we just do it i don't think he

[13:00]
should we just do it i don't think he
has much questions [ __ ] it i'm just
gonna do it
it's a recreational player
recreational players are afraid for
flashes guys
yo man really like your stream thank you

[13:15]
yo man really like your stream thank you
very much sir
[Music]

[13:30]
[Music]
going in slow play mode slow play mode
good turn
waiting for three blanks to fall off
before i start racing

[13:47]
which is quite hard but that's why we
wait
right three blanks to fall off
wow three blanks actually do fall off

[14:02]
wow three blanks actually do fall off
ah he felt the trap a pocket nines with
a heart
don't actually start with a bat could
also check

[14:15]
it's a very valid option
now i think actually i'm going to be
barreling
am i

[14:30]
am i
it's a little bit loose blind versus
blind
then rever my plan was actually to
barrel a car like this but now that
that don't do it now i want to go back
to the flop and not bat this hand
basically

[14:46]
now i think we have a check on the turn
where is quite interesting

[15:00]
let me go for another minbad
and then now it's up to him

[15:38]
uh
funky hand guys this turned out to be

[15:45]
funky hand guys this turned out to be
quite a funky hand
turned out to be quite a funky hand
this turned out to be quite a funky hint

[16:04]
we thought about it for quite a while
you know what i always say guys when
they think about it for so long
gonna be a good blog and it actually
went through
it actually went through i like this bed

[16:16]
it actually went through i like this bed
a lot too this is really
really kind of sexy there i face a
barrel here
this is quite funky this is quite funky

[16:30]
going to call
i have no clue what's going on here
i just seriously hope he doesn't have
deuces

[16:49]
but i'm obviously not folding as he can
have jack himself

[17:00]
oh yes the jack six oh my god

terrible run out

[17:16]

friend

[17:31]

meme race

yeah that means we're gonna get it in
and hope he has ace jack

[17:46]
and hope he has ace jack
ace king suited that's not really a hand
i would raise get him with but hey
but hey good for him oh
this can be this can be that one that
part where dick is gonna give us a stack

[18:02]

gonna give us a stack come on tiki front
bed dunk
pot or something i don't know

[18:26]
