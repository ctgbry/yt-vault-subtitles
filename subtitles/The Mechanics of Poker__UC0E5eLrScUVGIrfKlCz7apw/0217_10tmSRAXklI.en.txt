coming up in today's hand history review
video adjustments when playing out of
position versus aggressive recreational
players when to pick Equity over no
equity when Barrel bluffing how
sometimes your hand is stronger and
worth money than what it might seem at

[00:15]
worth money than what it might seem at
first side and how sometimes it's better
to just sit out and leave the tables as
your opponents are playing on a whole
another level make sure to rate my hands
one out of 10 in the comments down below

further Ado let's get into the first

[00:30]
further Ado let's get into the first
hand which we will start off with a
little limpy limpy in early position
with Ace King now you might be asking
yourself wo why so tricky limping in
with the Ace King in early position well
that has everything to do with the
player left to act behind us as in this
case the button is a loose aggressive

[00:46]
case the button is a loose aggressive
recreational player when you're out of
position versus loose aggressive
recreational players your Equity
realization and fold Equity pre flop is
significantly reduced now what kind of
consequences does it have to our
strategy we should should be opening way

[01:01]
strategy we should should be opening way
tighter than the original solver range
suggested right because that range was
assuming that the players behind us are
also playing GTO and we're enjoying a
certain amount of fault equity and
Equity realization but because there's a
recreational here that now doesn't count

[01:15]
recreational here that now doesn't count
now the quote quote normal stand
straightforward adjustment we could then
be making is we can start opening way
Tighter and probably for a bigger sizing
this is one way we can punish it or we
can start limping and the reason why I
like limping is is a player profile like

[01:31]
like limping is is a player profile like
this is usually not going to stick
around for all that long at the table so
if we are just going to really knit it
up and wait for a good hand chances are
that before we finally get dealt at good
hand the players especially in position
will have already taken his money what
limping then allows you to do is it

[01:46]
limping then allows you to do is it
allows you to get in there and try to
stack the recreational before the other
players have taken his money another
benefit of limping is that we can
significantly boost the pot pre- flop
when we want to so in this case I'm
going to repop it to 200 so let's say he

[02:02]
going to repop it to 200 so let's say he
had a hand like King Jack offit and I
would have raised to my regular 2.2x he
would just call that and now he will
have isolated me to 40 and I make it 200
instead of playing a pot that's like six
big blinds we go to the Flop with a pot

[02:17]
big blinds we go to the Flop with a pot
being 40 big blinds so those are like
two general benefits and adjustments
that I like to make when the creational
position on me is very loose and
aggressive playing low boards out of
position this is not only a li but in

[02:31]
position this is not only a li but in
general let's say you made a three bat
and you're playing out of position vers
recreational players what I like to do
is I like to start with doing a lot of
checking now this is because on average
actually on both flop and turn when
check to recreationals are going to be

[02:46]
check to recreationals are going to be
over stabbing now if you do decide to go
for a seabat a spot that you might find
yourself in quite common is that then
the recreation or raises you and you're
not really sure what to do this is a
note that can be prevented by simp
simply checking and letting him step now

[03:01]
simply checking and letting him step now
all the hands that you would initially
want to see bat you now move to the
check race now this actually also makes
way more money because now on top of
your cat you would also have his step so
basically you're kind of investing in
your bluff you're letting him make a
bluff so you can re bluff if you have

[03:16]
bluff so you can re bluff if you have
you know a hand like King Jack with a
spade for example now obviously I blow
I've blown up the pot significantly
which is actually very good when we're
out of position as the shorter the spr
the lower the positional disadvantage

[03:31]
the lower the positional disadvantage
for the out of position player Vin goes
ahead and stab half pot which I think he
he will do with a very wide range I
think falling is out of the question so
now we have to decide do we want to make
a call or do we maybe want to just get
the money in I decided to go for the

[03:47]
the money in I decided to go for the
ladder I threw my money in and there's a
couple reasons why I really like this
play first of all it reduces his
positional advantage and it removes all
his play ability because we are simply
all in so he can no longer Bluff us off
so let's say for example we would check

[04:01]
so let's say for example we would check
call and turn is the nine of space and
need gems what do we do do we call do we
fold probably we have to fold but we're
not really sure where we at at the hand
unless we have a very good read our if
we really think it's that that that
insane that we can just literally close

[04:15]
insane that we can just literally close
our eyes we call twice it's fine another
Advantage is when we Jam is we always
get to realize our Equity the third
Advantage when we Jam is that we
sometimes get called by worse so let's
say as like ace5 56 a flush draw um he's

[04:31]
say as like ace5 56 a flush draw um he's
very likely going to call us he might
sometimes fall better but the spr is a
little bit too shallow I don't think
he's ever folding a pair to be honest uh
and he's going to fold out some hands
that are pretty live let's say he has

[04:45]
that are pretty live let's say he has
hand like 10 Jack of clubs or just in
general and like 10 Jack um two life
cards and back to straight draw and
especially if we call that H has a lot
of playability Advantage fors our hand
so these are for all these reasons I
like to jam it in now these type of
plays are actually solver proof but
usually you want to have the king of

[05:00]
usually you want to have the king of
spade simply to have more Equity when he
does have a pair in sver land obviously
everything is closed so you need that
extra Equity where here I don't think
it's close and I want just want to be
ripping in most of my Ace kings ace
Queens Ace Jacks Etc now obviously the
lower we go you know let's say we do

[05:16]
lower we go you know let's say we do
have Ace 10 off suit probably I want to
have a spade with it because you know
the we will now sometimes get caught by
hand like Ace Jacka Spades or you know
he will sometimes call you with Ace
queen or Ace King off suit and that's
not obviously not very good for a hand
like Ace 10 let me know rate his hand

[05:31]
like Ace 10 let me know rate his hand
roast his hand do whatever he want
comments down below one out of 10 he
does go ahead and make the call which
you know it's going to happen a decent
amount of the time and it's perfectly
fine obviously we prefer a fault and
take it home straight away and in this

[05:46]
take it home straight away and in this
case he unfortunately had a seven now
obviously we still have some Equity
versus a seven that's also what I like
about his hand we very rarely that
Deuces 4 sens is only a very small part
of Vain's range we're being dealt Queen
10 suited in early position phase a

[06:01]
10 suited in early position phase a
raise from the regular under the gun and
we decide to go for a little flat call
now why do we do that that's because the
big blind is a recreational player when
the big blind is a recreational player
usually the EVS of your hands will
change if we look at a solver we see

[06:16]
change if we look at a solver we see
that for example a hand like this in
theory with everyone playing GTO is
probably a fault or maybe has some EV in
three betting in this formations but
it's going to be very low in e what now
happens is that the hands that were

[06:31]
happens is that the hands that were
close in terms of folding and calling
they now become calls simply because
this guy is going to get in the pot and
he's going to make a lot of mistakes the
recreational indeed comes along kind of
what we expected and we see a flop of

[06:45]
what we expected and we see a flop of
875 that's uh not a great flop the
recreational leads out for one big blind
and the regular gets out of the way now
we have two options here I think we can
either call or race folding I think is
out of the question we only have to win
the pot 11% of the time I decided to go

[07:01]
the pot 11% of the time I decided to go
for a race I think in general This Bat
seems to be on the weaker side on
average and I think just raising will
already generate a decent amount of
fault Equity what I like about Queen 10
of clubs here if he does come over the

[07:15]
of clubs here if he does come over the
top we have a very easy fold let's say I
hand like Queen ten of diamonds I would
have preferred way more to see myself
call or let's say you have at hand like
10 Jack of clubs I think this is
something that players often get
backwards if you have had like 10 Jack
of clubs here you might be more inclined

[07:30]
of clubs here you might be more inclined
to race because you think you have
Equity however we have to take in
consideration that this guy can come
over the top a decent amount of the time
and then you don't want to be raising a
hand that has like okay equity and raise
you off in this case a Guta to the nuts
he can have a lot Sixx and then if we

[07:46]
he can have a lot Sixx and then if we
hit a nine if we have 10 Jack that's
obviously a situation that we would like
to guarantee ourselves to be in so if I
had like a 10 Jack clubs here I think we
should always call I decided to raise
with the queen 10 just applying a lot of
pressure straight away on like one bare
hands uh yeah kind of seeing what

[08:02]
hands uh yeah kind of seeing what
develops turno is the eight of diamonds
he checks and I think most players now
here would probably be done with the
hand I will talk here again about the
same concept if you have a draw here

[08:16]
same concept if you have a draw here
let's say you had
910 okay I think betting here is quite a
big punt I think when the spr gets small
and again we have to take in
consideration that this guy can now
definitely just check rip it in with a
five sometimes or a seven or of course

[08:30]
five sometimes or a seven or of course
an eight or a draw I think his check
race percentage is going to be quite
High here especially on a double flush
draw board this is General Trend that
you'll be seeing now when that happens
when you have a low spr or a double
flush draw board like this we really
want to be careful with B folding Equity

[08:45]
want to be careful with B folding Equity
so if I had a draw here let's say King
Jack of Hearts I would always be
checking and my betting range would
become very polarized between either
just air or something that can always
bet call off let's say you do have nine
of hearts or n of diamonds I think
that's at some point there's a cut off

[09:01]
that's at some point there's a cut off
point where you no longer have to bet
fault and you can just bet call your
hand that's when you should be betting
your Equity draws so I decided to Barrel
here with Queen 10 simply thinking that
if he now comes over the top it's
perfectly fine I think he's going to do

[09:15]
perfectly fine I think he's going to do
that quite often actually when he has an
eight simply because there's two
flushers on the board people fast play a
little bit more I will actually be good
some of the time this is actually
something you have to always take in
consideration when playing fors
recreational Players let's say has a
hand like nine10 here or queen six he's

[09:31]
hand like nine10 here or queen six he's
very likely to call so he could now for
example fold the hand like padus and he
can call us with nine1 or queen six so
in general having high cards I usually
like Ace highs for example let's say
I've had like ace four here ace four of
clubs perfect hand to to just barrel and

[09:47]
clubs perfect hand to to just barrel and
often check back River and win filling
calls now the river is the ace of
diamonds and he decides to check now
checking is not standard for
recreational players they do have the
tendency to dunk out quite a lot on all

[10:00]
tendency to dunk out quite a lot on all
streets which he hasn't done so far so
I'm kind of leaning towards thinking
that he's either going to have a five or
a seven I think that's going to be the
biggest part of his range obviously he
could still have had like 9 10 or queen

[10:15]
could still have had like 9 10 or queen
six which we're beating but I do think
he will also sometimes lead that out as
a bluff so I decided now to put Max
pressure on a five and a seven like I
said I think an eight is very much
reduced the way he played his hand I
think a hand like 69 or 4 six is

[10:30]
think a hand like 69 or 4 six is
definitely reduced he could have gotten
that in on the Flop could have gotten
that in on the turn if he did make a
flush he could sometimes dunk the river
obviously not always I think the only
question here is your sizing if you're
just trying to Bluff him off hand like
King 10 of Hearts King Jack of Hearts

[10:45]
King 10 of Hearts King Jack of Hearts
you know hands a B2 or five or seven
maybe we could also just bet smaller I
decided to not risk it and just Jam my
stack in before we see The Showdown let
me know uh comments down below one out
of 10 do you think this hand was well
played or do you think this is just a
complete pump VN did decide to call and

[11:01]
complete pump VN did decide to call and
he got there we were just investing in
this pot value raising flop value
betting turn he unfortunately did get
there on the river but for example if he
has three six of diamonds he will maybe
also have three6 of Hearts so obviously
we have the beat also when we check but

[11:15]
we have the beat also when we check but
I do think betting is just definitely
better he wins the pot and uh well we
might stack him later on in the session
next hand we're going to be defending
the big blind with pocket sixes we flop
a set now we could consider donking I

[11:31]
a set now we could consider donking I
wouldn't hate it from a theory
perspective this is probably not a board
that we want to be dunking on it's a bit
too high so that means that he will now
also connect and that significantly
reduces our advantage let's say it's 467
definitely in for dunking but now we

[11:45]
definitely in for dunking but now we
start with a check V check's behind and
the turn is a nine of clubs now
obviously this is not the greatest card
we would have preferred to see a king of
hearts but hey you got to play the cards
that you're dealt and we have to now
come up with a strategy I think we want

[12:00]
come up with a strategy I think we want
to keep our bat frequency on the higher
side and therefore have a small sizing
so that's what I decides to do and now
villain raises and this is where it
becomes very very interesting if we
think about his raising range now he

[12:17]
think about his raising range now he
could definitely obviously be raising an
eight even though you probably have to
be a little bit careful with raising an
eight simply because an eight now yes is
still good but we have more than one
behind and there's still rivers to play

[12:31]
behind and there's still rivers to play
that can significantly change the board
so raising too much ad hacks here I
think will be a problem other more
obvious raises that people will find
here will be H with equity which I think
is mainly going to be done more in

[12:46]
is mainly going to be done more in
practice than in theory for reasons that
I actually explained in the Queen T A
club's hand I actually decided to go
over the top and let's say you're now
sitting here with a hand like ace5 with
five a clubs or king queen with a club
you know it's it's not great so I think

[13:00]
you know it's it's not great so I think
in theory the race should be a little
bit more polarized and I think in
practice it's a bit more merged so a bit
more linear so meaning that he has more
hands with Equity he probably has more
adax and I think what this does is it
puts quite a lot of pressure straight

[13:15]
puts quite a lot of pressure straight
away on a hand like King 8 right because
king8 if we think about it what I'm
saying is I'm saying I have a flush King
eight is dead against the flush right
and from his perceived situation my
Bluffs would probably be something like

[13:31]
Bluffs would probably be something like
King Jack with a club so if he thinks
about my reign he like well I'm either
dead when when he has king8 because you
know wo either has a flush or he
probably has a lot of equity he has like
King Jack with a club so I think there's
a very big chance and eight now fold

[13:46]
a very big chance and eight now fold
straight away and let's say he has a
hand like two pair like 910 79 or like a
king Jack with a club or king queen with
a club he's likely going to call so this
is what I meant with on first first on

[14:00]
is what I meant with on first first on
first glance my hand might actually not
look that great but if we think about it
it's actually a very good hand so I
decided to come over the top filling
calls which I do expect to happen some
of the time of course and River now is a
five what is the highest e you play well

[14:17]
five what is the highest e you play well
if we thought about it that he could
have a hand like 109 or 79 or a Miss
flush draw I would say it's probably
block I think block is a perfectly fine
play here here but I in game decided to

[14:31]
play here here but I in game decided to
go for the check as I was more focused
on the fact that I think on the turn he
has a lot of King Jacks King Queens Ace
Jacks Ace FS type of Holdings with a
club then that he has necessarily hands
that I now lose value from so I check

[14:46]
that I now lose value from so I check
fin throws out a big bat going for pot
and I decided to make the call this was
kind of the plan that we had right on
the turn make him fold an eight make him
call with a flush draw when the flush
draw Miss we decide to Hero call let me

[15:00]
draw Miss we decide to Hero call let me
know comments down below one out of 10
do you think this is a great great great
plate hand or do you think this simply a
punt let me know he decided to show up
with the King Jack with the king of Club
so our plan worked out perfectly and we
scooped in a nice little 1.2k pot and

[15:17]
scooped in a nice little 1.2k pot and
for the last hand we get Del pocket
Force opening up get flatted on the
button and on the big blind and we see a
flop of Ace King 4 it gets checked to us
and we have to think about strategy here

[15:30]
and we have to think about strategy here
now I do think we have some advantages
and I don't think range checking here is
a great strategy so I decided that I
would have a betting range but it's not
going to be a linear betting range so
I'm going to construct a more polarized
betting range so I decided to go for a
two3 pot I think somewhere between half

[15:47]
two3 pot I think somewhere between half
and 2/3 it's probably fine and basically
what I'm saying is that I Haven had like
Ace Queen Ace King bucket force and
Bluffs would probably some Queen 10 some
10 Jack some Queen Jack SU with back
doors a four let's say at four five

[16:01]
doors a four let's say at four five
suited and probably had like pocket
fives would probably be a good bluff
here as well so that's low betting
frequency with a range that I now kind
of explained filling calls and big blind

[16:15]
of explained filling calls and big blind
fults now when villain calls I think
he's very very acex heavy I think what
the sizing also does let's let's say he
has hand like 10 Jack of Hearts I expect
him to just fold straight away or maybe
even a hand like 10 Jack with a back
door flush draw
so I think his range is dominantly going

[16:32]
so I think his range is dominantly going
to be ace high so when the turn now is a
queen like I said I think most 10 Jack
sued are just going to fall The Flop so
I think we have the best hand basically
always so this is basically still the
nuts and I decide to use that advantage

[16:48]
nuts and I decide to use that advantage
and go for an
overb now I think the BET here is maybe
a bit too big I think somewhere around
pots would have been slightly better
because obviously we do have to take in
consideration that River can come a
diamond he can definitely have ASX of

[17:00]
diamond he can definitely have ASX of
diamonds or maybe King jack of diamonds
a 10 and a jack which would also really
kill us because I think if he calls
again his range is really much waited
towards Ace Jack suited Ace 10 suited
Ace Queen suited or a race Queen in
general like I said King X King xit
diamonds ASX a diamond so in general you

[17:17]
diamonds ASX a diamond so in general you
don't really want to be investing too
much money when the river can really
shift the equities in the other person's
favor so I think this bet is a bit too
big fing calls
now the river is the worst card possible

[17:33]
now the river is the worst card possible
Ace xit diamonds got there King X of
diamonds got there Ace 10 suited got
there these are all hands that I think
can definitely be in his range we could
maybe find a bet sizeing for which we

[17:45]
maybe find a bet sizeing for which we
could Val better hand probably around
10% try to get a call from Ace Jack or a
queen but I decided to uh to check and
kind of give up and when villain jams I
didn't really thought much about it and
just just snap folded and to my surprise

[18:02]
just just snap folded and to my surprise
villain showed up with turning Ace Queen
into a bluff now this guy we've actually
had on our podcast it's Mr Prodigy shout
out to Mr Prodigy for owning and this is
kind of what I meant with sometimes guys

[18:15]
kind of what I meant with sometimes guys
you know you just have to accept that
some of these guys are on a whole
another level and we should just sit out
leave the table and probably find
different players to play against
because this guy is at a whole another
level shout out to Mr if you haven't
seen the podcast go definitely check it

[18:31]
seen the podcast go definitely check it
out very smart guy very good talk let me
know what you thought about this hand
how I played it I think the main
decision-making point that we could talk
about is maybe the turn sizing and I
guess the river strategy obviously if he

[18:45]
guess the river strategy obviously if he
always Bluffs always Ace queens and his
Ace Jacks he's probably going to be
significantly over bluffing right so you
could make an argument well if you
really think your opponent's at dead
level then he's over bluffing but the
majority of players are going to be
massively under bluffing here they're
just going to check behind his Queen and
not really think about it and this shows

[19:01]
not really think about it and this shows
I think uh what makes him such a strong
player that he considers turning a head
like Ace Queen into a bluff here really
shows you that he's thinking about the
game hope you like this video If You did
