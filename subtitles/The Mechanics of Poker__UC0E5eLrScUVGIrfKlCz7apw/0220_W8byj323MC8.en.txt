how easy would poker be if you could see
your opponent's cards only easy
decisions right but what if I told you
that if you pay close attention to the
following you might be able to do just
that as in this video I will show you
guys how to pick up on TS of your
opponents use this information to your
advantage alter your strategy and make
higher EV decisions let's go I want you
to take a look at this hand played by
one of our mechanics of Poker students
in one of the member
[Music]
reviews I do mostly range breting when
uh in fre position the free FL rer
unless the board is too connected what
did you think pretty straightforward
stuff right let's look at this again but
this time pay very close attention
[Music]
did you see
it he snap called your three bat now why
does this matter you might be asking
yourself well the timing reveiews
information about villain's range and
ranges determine the equities and in the
end it's the equities that dictate the
appropriate strategy when he snaap calls
your three bat in this situation it is
very likely that he has a hand that was
never going to fold and never going to
forbat which makes his range go from
something like
this to something looking more like
[Music]
this when his range looks more like this
do you still want to be seting range on
107 du probably not as against the first
range while being slightly behind we at
least still had the nuted advantage and
therefore it's okay to start seab
betting however against the second range
we no longer have disadvantage and are
even further behind in equity overall
and generally speaking it is not a great
idea to open the action and start
putting a bunch of money in the pot when
you have no advantage to back this up
when we informed the solver about the
information our opponent gave away about
his range he quickly adjusts his
strategy and basically stops seab
betting allog together now I would not
recommend checking back Queen Plus in a
situation where it's very likely that
your opponent has a worse pair than
yours and him not being aware of the
fact that your seab betting range is
only Queens plus but I think we can all
agree that seab betting Ace King is now
no longer such a great idea when hero
mentioned his General approach for this
spot he most likely used the first GTO
range I showed you he then went into the
aggregated frequencies for seab betting
in position as initial razor and he
maybe looked at some population ten es
how they respond to cat to come up with
an overall simplified Baseline strategy
and while this process is very valuable
he forgot one very important thing your
opponents are giving away information
about their range all the time therefore
we must always remain on the lookout
stay adaptable in our strategies as with
this information we can make adjustments
which will significantly boost our win
rate this can be specific information
about player Tendencies bet sizing tails
and betting patterns or as in this case
a tail in
timing I will give you guys another
example we're reviewing our student and
he is playing button versus big blind he
see the Flop and checked back the turn
stuck either way here between bat and
check Nosh which I prefer he snap checks
to river which is weird man now our
opponent naap checks to us on the river
if we look at the GTO strategy we see
that we don't want to bet a lot and if
we do it's for a smaller
sizing now how much and how big we get
to bet is determined by the equities and
the equities are determined by the
ranges so let's take a look at what the
range looks like in theory we can see it
checking quite some acex and 3X towards
us and therefore our Equity is decreased
however to check an Ace and especially a
three or better usually require some f
so it's way more likely that he has a
hand that was never interested in
betting in the first place so his range
instead of looking like this will likely
be looking more like
this which will have drastic
consequences to our strategy so in this
B check b line we now go from betting
not that often for a small sizing to
betting way more often bigger and
thinner for Value as the range we likely
face giving his timing looks way
different than in solver land so while
there is great benefit in working with
solvers studying certain notes and
building Baseline strategies we must
never forget the underlying mechanics to
the game and why in GTO or in our
Baseline Strate
we decided to play a certain strategy in
game when the opportunity arises we must
rise above our Baseline strategy process
this new information no lock in our hat
