when they say I W to I want to be the
best you know I want to play on high
staks do you know what that
means you you have a lot of experienced
uh coaching players maybe also to give
like some pointers to some of the
listeners what do you think are like
very common mistakes and leagues that
players have like that that you
encounter that kind of stops them from
reaching higher higher levels of
success yeah I feel it's always the same
but always different
um like the number one thing we we had
really big struggles the first nine
months I would
say and you mentioned it before is this
when you expect something that you
didn't even realize you expect because
you thought it's so
clear and and I think that shows like
when you have an understanding of let's
say let's say we have an understanding
of playing high stakes and then we
reverse that into okay Rene you have an
understanding of playing High sticks I
have an understanding of playing High
sticks and then we describe a person we
believe belongs onto High SES and how
does that person work or what you know
what's his routine what what are his
characteristics and uh and then you
compare to someone who's playing midak
and you're
like what is that person
doing and then when when they say I want
to I want to be the best you know I want
to on high
SS then you're assuming that they have
that understanding
too because that's what I assumed is
like okay you know do you know what that
means do do you know what it means to be
one of the best you know do you do you
know what it means how how to work how
much time like how how much
professionalism you have to show how
effective you have to work um and and
what you have to bring to the the table
and I think that's where the first
discrepancy starts is expectation and
expectation management it's a very loose
sentence to throw around to I want to be
great you know I want to be the best I
want to I want to play high stes it's a
very loose
sentence but when you talk when you look
at actions and when you look at what
people are actually doing I would say
that is the biggest struggle is actions
don't match the words so they basically
you confront them with this
I confront them with this
often um what is then a common what is a
common response that that you get was
like the first the first level of
resistance sentence that they throw at
you afterwards there's not really
resistance there's some resistance but
there's not really resistance I think uh
because they they're
probably they take what I say pretty
serious so I think that is a very good
starting point but
it's it's um
like
let I I think a big a really big point
is let's say you stand there right you
look at
something and I stand on the other side
or maybe even I stand on top and I see a
bit more and now the thing in the middle
let's say is working in a group or
having a group of people to work with or
exchange and now that person is looking
at that idea that concept and is like
evaluating this idea is like yeah you
know working in a group is I have a few
buddies if I grind Sunday I post a hand
in there maybe they give some response
there's some value so they valuate this
thing from this perspective I evaluate
it from this perspective and saying okay
if you work in a group and you're eight
people and eight people prepare content
and every person puts in three hours
into 30 minutes of content you have four
hours of content you share that content
within three hours of work you have uh
you you get 3 hours and 30 minutes of
other content of people who have put
their time in there so 3 hours of input
and higher density of content you know
now like now suddenly if you do this as
a routine uh if I put in just you know
this amount of time if I take this very
seriously I can swap with those guys I
can study with those guys I can drill
with those guys I can learn with them I
can travel with them life book is
goingon to be so basically I see this
whole package of like a group is
probably one of the most meaningful and
most valuable things you can have in
poker if you find people who are just
you know willing to commit and and can
produce high quality
and they look at every We Like H you
know group is like you know it's nice
nice to have some people to chat with
but not really so you already have such
a big clash in the understanding of what
the value is so they're not willing
to nobody nobody is like why should I
why should I you
know proactively spend four hours to
prepare something because it's not clear
to you that everyone's doing that right
it's not this clear thing where like
yeah if I do that because it's not a
clear reaction you you might do it
nobody else does something you're like
why did I do that so and it's also I I
guess their definition right you say do
you work do you work with other players
they say yes but work with other players
your definition of work with other
players you just described whereas their
work with other players is yeah I shared
a hand history on Sunday you know after
I played this
tournament yeah or you know a loose
review or like and they work with
players that are you know much worse
than them and there's not really a
strong ethic and it's like very loose
and you just hang out after grind and
like you know kind of this like a social
it's more a social event right it's more
like a social thing which is also
totally fine and and I think those
things are important too but I think in
terms of again if you if you're in this
mode of hey I want to be one of the best
you just uh you got to increase the
intensity of output to a degree where
you progress significantly faster than
other people in your in your competition
group and um I think we are at a point
now and that's why I'm very excited
because if I open Discord you know if I
compare now now it feels more like
breathing to them where there's like you
know there's like like even this week
you know there's just constantly stuff
today now and like one hour there's a
session like everyone's joining like
people are chatting all the time like
they in different time zones someone
does a study session at 2 am someone
else is joining it's just like it just
feels like vibrant and something's
happening all the time and when you have
that then it's at that point it's like
you wouldn't even know you would never
want to go back so um I mean it's also I
think it's a good good actually pointer
for people listening to this SP I'm sure
there's many people that maybe listened
to all our episodes and they probably
like maybe I have a check this yeah I do
that I do that but what does it actually
mean they were like yeah well I work
with people yeah I do this I do that but
it's the quality with which you do it
that's going to determine the outcome I
think another very common thing that I
hear when you say oh well you want to
work get to high stakes then you have to
do this this and this and then they say
yeah but that's not necessary at my
Stakes you know because I'm playing low
stakes or mid Stakes but like but if
you're not doing it now you will also
not do it later and the fact that you're
not doing it now means that you're not
getting to the high stakes right so I
think it's always a good reflection that
let's say for example someone listening
is playing make lower stakes and mid
Stakes how would you structure your week
or how would you prepare for a session
if tomorrow you would have to play
against Fedor for example and they might
say like oh wow no yeah if I play
against fed tomorrow you know then I
might skip that hamburger tonight you
know I might eat something healthy or I
might do go to the gym you know because
I want to feel sharp well approach
tomorrow like you would play against
fader then that would be that would I
think be my advice you did yeah go ahead
yeah you because you asked around I I
mentioned one big thing I see in people
struggling or is is this mismatch of
actions and expectations and I I would
say that's probably the major point
because generally I would
say
uh people want to be successful for a
variety of different
reasons but in poker I believe you need
to as intrinsically as possible just
wanted more than the majority of things
in your life otherwise I would say it's
almost
impossible like I always make this
example I think it is very very very
important that you don't force
this because I've also worked with
players who have lots of interest for
example
they love they have a variety of
different
hobbies and bker is one of those you
know like let's say out of the five
hobbies that they're very you know they
love biking they they they love uh
skydiving they they do this regular you
know like even like let's say they they
travel to do this and like and and and
then they love poker as well but you
know and you also have you have a
girlfriend and you have a strong Social
Circle and like lots of friends outside
you went to UNI and you you know like
your family's in Germany you also love
to visit your family and and then I see
poker more as a lifestyle
facilitator and that for me I don't I
think you there's always something
negative connected with this because
there's always this element you know
it's just kind of like it's not the the
the whole deal like you don't try to
make I think that is such a great thing
to use poker for
like I think poker is such a great thing
to do 30 hours a week or like 25 hours a
week I think it's a great thing now you
can make 100K a year no problem um you
will never play tritons probably and you
will probably never play high stakes and
you probably never will make
250k but for you know five years it's a
great great thing to do especially if
you like it you can travel to a few
places says you know it it can be
mentally very challenging it can develop
in certain things and it just has to be
clear you got to move on at some point
and and um and also it's got to be clear
it's just never the fullon thing but but
I think that is a very important
realization that a lot of prayers
struggle with because it's very hard to
to accept that with yourself as like hey
you know this is this is kind of a My
Lifestyle profession then then then they
kind of never feel never feel satisfied
I guess because then they do spend the
things and their Hobbies but then then
they maybe feel guilty ah but I should
try to become this great poker player
and if they would then kill all their
hobbies and focus on poker they also
feel miserable so it's very important I
think what you're pointing out is that
you kind of know what's important to you
and where does poker fit in so is indeed
poker just a facilitator for the other
things that is important to you then
that's great but it's a problem when you
do the other things and you kind of feel
guilty that you should spend time on
poker and unfortunately I mean the
reality of Poker is is you're competing
as other guys and there's someone there
you know spending 247 on poker you know
it's very likely that he he is going to
outperform you actually another point
that I wanted to add you know like the
way you describe that you approach
sessions right some some players might
listen or I guess the majority might
listen but like oh well but that's not
normal and they would look around well
you don't do that you don't do that well
if you do the thing you know that's
normal quote quote you will get the
results at normal quote quote aka the
results of the majority and the majority
is not a high six poker player right so
maybe you know doing things different is
probably a good idea if you want to have
different results than the majority yes
but then also it's not that hard I also
really I always try to say that because
I understand like you have to put a lot
of effort into lining yourself up let's
say it like this like to just get in a
good routine but then the actual doing I
think is surprisingly easy it is when it
becomes normal right because you don't
think differently yeah but also just the
the tasks at hand I think are not as
challenging as in other areas for
example I think it is often rather
rewarding tasks um
pretty pretty action based or pretty
outcome based where something you learn
almost immediately helps you something
for what you're
doing um it's very practical like I
think people often forget that that it's
just actually a very very nice way to to
learn learn and practice something it's
like I I would say if you work let's say
15 hours on your game or 20 hours on
your game a week you're outperforming
the absolute vast majority and if you
put in those you know
like rather smart you know with like a
high drive to improve the processes and
improve your learning process and find
good routines for yourself with a high
level of practical drilling rather fit
to to um to practical outcomes in in
your actual gameplay you'll make great
strides of progress
and it's not an it's not an absurd
amount of of time effort
um but I think to get to that point
often times people struggle a lot so
uh so yeah you need the right uh the
right
