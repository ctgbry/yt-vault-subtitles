Let's Help transition a person's mind
into thinking okay you know this GTO
approach that I have is like the perfect
way to play where that couldn't be
really farther from the truth in my
opinion I mean the more information and
the more understanding that you have
inside the game of all the different
mechanics inside of it add so much to
like that infinite spider web that the
game is of Poker especially more when
you talk about tournaments as opposed to
like H 100 big blind cash over and over
where you see all of these different
scenarios with different players at
different stages of the tournament and
depending on even how they feel that day
is going to determine how they play this
hand so if you're just looking at you
know the sheet in front of you you're
missing a lot of the
picture yeah know I like and I really I
heard you talk a lot in uh actually we
haven't really started the pot yet but
just I I I I get excited because I heard
you talk a lot about stuff like uh I
feel like the energy at the tables the
flow of the game maneuvering around the
situations and actually there's a lot of
alignment in philosophy have you ever
read the book Art of War heard about the
book yeah and like there's one
philosophy in there from sunu which I
strongly relate with and which is a big
philosophy in my poker game and I think
you would agree it's like the avoid what
is strong and strike what's weak you try
to you try to figure out okay when are
people weak that's when you strike and
you try to figure out when people are
strong that's when you try to avoid
that's really kind of what I got from
hearing you talk about poker it's like
yeah you you just try to pick up on as
much information as possible which give
you a more accurate idea about his range
and then you can just look at your hand
well how does my hand does against his
range well I think he's pretty strong
well I think he's pretty weak so let's
let's follow it up accordingly right and
then like you know the let's you know go
through the stage of GTO everyone's so
studied at pre flop poker so they're
masters of pre- flop poker but now bring
them like deep in the spiderweb on these
turn and River spots that you know they
couldn't have done enough study to
really be sharp in this situation so
it's like yeah of course you know I know
that you you guys have it down of
Defending ranges and the big blind and
how to play these pre flop three betting
spots but when you wind up in these
strange ones that you couldn't really
have gotten that far in like studying
chart I think because I see poker is
such like a infinite game with that you
have to take every bit of information
that you
have yeah I mean you're you're clearly a
puzzle solver right you try to get
yourself into situation and you solve
the puzzle whereas the new school poker
players maybe a bit more studied in
terms of charts and less good at solving
the puzzle that's presented to them
weird situations like what the hell is
going on I don't know I haven't seen
this I haven't seen this solution yet so
yeah what do I do now like they take
away like their power of creativity from
themselves because now they just base
every play that they make okay you know
I'm going to go check it up after the
tournament oh okay solver says it's
right okay all done on actually use my
brain at all and solve any problems then
it just turns into a memorization game
and then you wind up
yeah deep in the spiderweb with some
tough spiders and they're going to eat
you alive I I love the Spider Web the
spider web we definitely we need to get
back all right let's let's let's let let
me introduce you in the pot and let's
start the pot before you know we ramble

work with me and Adam and make 2024 your
best poker year ever introducing today's
guests we will be chatting with the
current number one alltime money list
holder Brinn Kenny What drew me
personally to invite Brin on the pot is
both his polarizing character some might
hate him some might love him I'm
personally more in the love Camp myself
his tolerance to risk constantly putting
big chunks of his Network on the line
and the confidence he has in himself
regardless of his results I'm also very
curious about his development throughout
poker starting out as a gamer but later
start to see poker as a great vehicle to
learn more about yourself and about life
he's also mentioned that we are all
students of life and he's very
passionate about learning and developing
himself in our areas be it technically
social physically or spiritually this
personal growth has allowed him to be
more present in the moment while playing
poker so he can better listen to his
instincts feel the flow of the game
maneuver around the poker tables and
make great decisions as always I'm
joined with my co-host co- mechanics of
Poker coach Mr mindset and performance
Adam carmichel Adam ring comes across as
a very intuitive player who follows his
gut when we mention topics like
intuition gut feel
there's usually a bit of vake topics
could you maybe clarify for the audience
what a gut feeling actually is and how
it can both help but also hinder the
quality of your poker
decisions I would class a good feeling
as a access to knowledge which isn't in
your kind of conscious reasoning and
conscious thinking and this is often off
millions of data points if you think
someone like brins probably played
millions and millions of Pock hands he's
built a strong intuitive feeling of how
spots feel so for example often you can
see an opponent feels strong in the spot
or he feels weak it's not like I've
consciously thought through his range
it's like the sample size I have
intuitively is telling me he's either
strong or he's weak here now where that
can go wrong is we have something called
biases which lead us in directions where
our emotions that say we're risk of us
and we have an intuitive feeling to fold
but that might be coming from a fear or
a fear or insecurity where you don't
want to put chips in so we've got to
navigate this space of how do we listen
to our intuition how do we develop a
strong intuitive feeling spot how do we
still use our logic to make good
decisions and then when does that keep
us take us astray so yeah I'm looking
forward to this conversation with Brinn
we can go deeper into how he uses his
own intuition to make decisions and I'm
very interested in extracting as much
knowledge as we can from
him yeah me too this guy has a lot of
knowledge really really excited to start
chatting but before we start I would

into goodness of today's episode all
right Brin great to have you on the PT
man you have recently reclaimed the
number one spot I saw on the alltime
money list congratulations you you took
down the 250k for 6.8 million not not a
bad score I was wondering is being
number one which you are right now is
that something that you have always
strived towards ever since you got into
poker and if so what drives you and what
gives you the confidence to set a goal
because I can imagine a lot of people
just start to play out poker and see
well you know let's see how far I can
take it and their confidence Rises when
their results rise but you straight away
said listen I'm going to be number one
where how how does it work I don't like
I guess it's hard where where does that
come from because I just had this I
guess innate confidence in myself I
think I would say that it has to start
from like your upbringing as a child the
amount of like love and support that you
get so I would shoot it all back from
like really the beginning the beginning
where I feel like I had an amazing
family amazing parents who gave me tons
of love and enabled my creativity I
think that a lot of
people kind of get their creativity
stolen from them at different stages in
their life either if it's their parents
the system of school the system of the
world and what it expects from you
you're supposed to maybe fit into like a
certain mold where I feel like it was
instilled as me into me like to be my
own person and to believe in that and I
think that there's no way you can really
have confidence in yourself like that
unless if you're really in touch with
yourself
so I've I I think that um I don't know
it was just like a match made in heaven
I guess me and poker from the beginning
is like as soon as I started playing
poker I really loved the aspects of
testing yourself uh always like being in
continuous growth and trying to be a
better and better version of yourself
while competing against other people who
are trying to do the same and see
themselves as the top it made it really
fun for me so I think that's another
part of it like you really need to have
fun I might be shooting it a little
early but um like I I have friends that
said right when I really got into poker
at 17 years old that I was I was saying
to them that I was going to be number
one in the world and to imagine where
that comes from you know now being such
like a different version of myself than
the 17 year-old version know this
version would have to say on one side
that a bit of a lunatic no matter what
like a bit of a a a different screw I
guess than others but then also just
like a belief that I could make
something that I see that maybe others
would convince themselves that it's not
possible you know let's you imagine that
thought and we all have so many
different thoughts and I feel like a lot
of people are prone to not believing in
their thought and saying that this is
too Grand of a thing that you know how
could like there's no way that I could
actually accomplish this because at that
point you know you see you're at this
huge mountain and you're at the bottom
you really just started on the mountain
and there are so many people climbing it
and you're saying in your head you know
I'm going to be the one who reaches the
top of the mountain at some point or F
not really first because you know there
were other people who played but I guess
the reaching the highest point of that
mountain I guess it is because since the
number one alltime winner is always
growing I guess the mountain also has to
like grow so reaching the highest like
level of that mountain you know a lot of
it's very easy to tell yourself that you
can't do it you know no matter what if
you have like that thought but I I think
it's the same to believe that you can
and I don't know my my whole like
experience because uh before I was
playing poker I was playing Magic the
Gathering and my goal was to be number
one in the world and the 15 and under
Group which is when I really played
Magic the Gathering there was a pro tour
and the jss junior Super Series they
called it which was 15 and under and
there were two different levels and I
was able to reach number one in the
world in that so I think that was like
the preemptive belief that okay I was I
already saw something that was that is
this you know Grand thing to reach I was
able to make it happen now this new
thought comes into my head that I can
reach it on a different mountain and I
just had the I believe that thought
and you know it never I would say at the
same time though nothing nothing's
nothing's given and nothing's easy you
know you L you accept the I I see Life
as like infinite possibilities so it's
like when I started to climb this
mountain of Poker to be the best I was
given a certain type of Road of
challenges that you would have to uh
accomplish to reach like that top of the
mountain and I think that it was much
different than most other people
experience in poker because you see a
lot of the winners they kind of
continuously win so they have this
upward trajectory all the people that
you're playing with really in high
rollers they're winning in a yearly
basis and they don't have you know the
necessarily the leaks because kind of
the guys who have leaks and betting
Sports and other things they wind up
like really washing off at some point
because it's going to be too big of a
leak to actually well I guess it just it
compounds the difficulty of like the
road that you're on so you know my leak
was always
staking spending a bit too much money I
don't know if I wouldn't call it a leak
so helping out too many people is
definitely not a leak but if you look at
it in terms of like what happened to my
bankroll at different stages it was
definitely massively affected by helping
a lot of people but at the the same time
I wouldn't call that a leak that's
something that I enjoy doing and it's
like I guess it's also who you help
right yeah because that yeah well yeah
exactly like the beginning you know you
think you're helping other poker players
taking them and giving them like a path
to win and then you realize that that
doesn't really work and then you then
start gearing your help towards people
who are actually making an influence
with that help are able to use your
resources to positively benefit more
people instead of just this one person
game but then at the same time you know
because it's like um what was like the
fire that kept me going so along this
journey from when I started playing
poker to reaching number one I went from
millionaire to broke to negative
500k to millionaire to making a bad
business deal negative
millionaire uh get back in like the
green again build up a million again so
it there was none of this like uh you
know calm Road it was like a wild and
crazy ride of like you know can you hang
on to the roller coaster like when it's
flipping you every which way and the
thing for me that I think made it
possible for me to even hang on the
roller coaster at those stages is
because I always equated My Success to
uh enabling more happiness to others
starting with my immediate family in
terms of you know when I was a kid my
parents had bills they had there were
all these reasons why I wanted to be
successful so that I could help my
parents my grandma my siblings so all of
My Success then equated to in my mind
happiness for others and as as you're
young you don't necessarily do it in the
best way you're always learning you know
you might be enabling people at some
points where you're trying to help them
but it might not be the best approach
but at the same time you don't really
have the tools in your bag yet to
understand what the best approach is but
it's like because of that no matter how
bad of a spot I was in like I went from
uh building starting uh the end to One
Summer with 50k on Full Tilt three
months later I had three and a half
million on Full Tilt six months later I
had negative 500k and lost it all and
most of it like was from staking and
then so I wind up in this spot where I'm
negative
500k and uh I was playing to get there I
was playing the highest takes PLO I I
just like hopped in PLO and started
winning and once I get to this negative
500 figure I'm starting to exhaust like
the credit I can get from people and the
ability really to operate so I've got to
pull it all back and say okay well uh I
might have been playing 500 a th000 PLO
versus Ivy winning two months ago but
now I've got to play $20 tournaments and
just make two 300 a day just to to dig
myself out of this hole so I feel like
too A lot of times people get into a
hole and they think they can get
themselves out overnight where I'm very
patient in those situations and I think
good at making decisions back against
the wall but it's like that fire of
helping my family helping more than
myself so it's like I would equate it to
like a gladiator in the arena and you
know sometimes you might have a leg
chopped off you're going to be in a bad
spot like sometimes you have to accept
that though and whatever comes out of
the other side know all you can do is
give it your best but at the same time
keep giving it your best until your
final breath and yeah that ability to
help people really resonates with me the
most it's what I what I like the most
really about this life experience that
we have is positively affecting people
and trying to share the lessons and the
skills that you've learned or
harness during this
life yeah I mean sounds great but I mean
that's also a reason why you agreed I
guess to come on this spot right to
share your your experience so I mean a
lot of striving poker players or already
professional poker players listening
that probably have some of them will
have the same ambition but some of them
oh Kenny is now number one well I'm
going to be number one and Kenny is now
here going to explain me how I can have
to believe in myself to actually become
number one but it sounded like like your
upbringing gave you sort of the
permission to believe in yourself right
you mentioned creativity and then I
guess your experience in Magic at a
young age kind of gave you that
confirmation like hey I got the
permission to be confident and I've with
my skills I now actually have the right
to be confident because I'm actually
very good at Magic you then went on I
think you mentioned you had 50k on food
til went to 3.5 million I I assume that
didn't happen over there how did you
then switch from Magic to playing poker
and when did you kind of could could you
kind of call yourself a professional and
how did that let's say first year of
your professional career look like did
that straight away go to this 50k three
and a half million and back to that was
a few years like into the into the
career just since we were on like the
mindset I I got into that a bit early
but um so yeah like magic uh so I played
magic really until I was 16 and was out
of that jss thing I probably played some
poker like in that time still but that's
when I really I guess transition my love
for games from Magic into poker and
at that time I was just playing with
some friends in high school we would
play a sit and go in my grandpa's
backyard and afternoon of some days and
just play between friends and I wound up
playing a bit more like between friends
and at this same time uh it was when
David Williams made his Deep Run in the
World Series main event and Dave
Williams being a magic player kind of
had the magic players thinking like oh
wow you know this guy just won I forget
what it was maybe 2 million 3 million in
the early days of I think it was in 2005
so anyone who played magic was really
like oh I must be in the wrong game and
I this is the game for like higher
Stakes so I got to jump into this one
and then uh it was just like as soon as
I started playing online I was really
just hooked that at poker stars at the
time just had decent size well for the
state for that time I was playing 5 10
20 30 tournaments that I would just hop
in for and they kind of had that all day
all throughout the night so my first
year after high school was when I really
got into it a lot and I was in pretty
good shape uh when I graduated high
school but I gained 60 pounds in the
first year just playing poker all day
every day
ordering shitty food really all
throughout the day um so then uh my
parents were or my mom more was
concerned that I should should go to
college so I said okay you know I'll
apply I'll go to this community colge
right around the corner from us was one
of the best community colleges in the
country so it's like okay whatever to
satisfy you guys I'll go sign up over
here but I think it was in the first uh
two weeks that I just really had no
interest for it of sitting there through
accounting classes and this that and the
other it really just didn't peque any of
my interest or creativity and I was
already playing uh a bit of Poker but I
hadn't really found any success and I
remember it was during W coups in a
September and there was a tournament
that I really liked that I had to miss
for class and I just after that I just
left the class and said yeah I'm done
and just priorties man
priorities yeah yeah I get well that
like belief because most people would
then convince themselves no I'm supposed
to go to school so like kind of safe
route right continue like some something
that they really lose all of their
creativity where it's like um and that's
why that's one of the reasons why I love
poker I think it's it's it can be such a
creative expression of yourself where
there are so many different poker styles
that you could craft a world-class
strategy of from very tight to very
aggressive and there's somewhere in
there that you can craft a masterful
strategy in there which means that the
best way that you could play poker is
how you feel like playing poker and
there a lot of people that playing Super
aggressive wouldn't really work for just
their personality and the same for like
the other side of the spectrum whereas
now since kind of the approach and at
the same time the way that the media
portrays it is that this is a solved GTO
game where there's a perfect way of
playing the game and nothing else which
I would say completely takes anyone's
creativity out of it which now you don't
have really any space
to to make your magic let's call it in
the in the way that works for you you're
now following like a book so so for me
that thinking is kind of going back to
the same approach of following the path
of going to school and getting a job
you're supposed to do this and you're
supposed to do that so then taking
really the fun out of the game and if
you're not having fun in it you're never
going to be able to be your best either
I think that was yeah I I I get that
especially I can relate to it like in
terms of like solver age where it's just
like well now I'm just following what
the solver says and everything kind of
does what the solver does so I just
follow the solver as well and then kind
of the creativity gets drawn out of it
and with that also the fun gets drawn
out of it yeah and and now we're in a
time where all of the poker programs are
talking GTO everything and right play
and wrong play and that you can't win
unless if you play this GTO approach
know if I was someone on the outside
listening to this it sounds like the
least fun game ever where like I see
poker as like the most fun game ever
where there's so many possibilities to
craft like your own style now you're
trying to sell something to people that
has no fun in it most of the people that
you're watching on there don't look like
they're having fun either they're not
saying anything doing anything and you
know I I'm not someone that's you don't
have to talk to people you know in hands
and do X and Y but you know for me it
was always like if someone you're in a
high roller scene so you see a lot of
the same people every day and you know
if someone new comes to the scene
usually they're a recreational person if
a lot of people don't know them they're
a recreational player and you know they
want they're there to have fun you need
to Poker needs to be fun to be able to
attract those type of people to actually
want to play so I was always the one
that would talk to this person you know
and I'm also very interested in people
especially ones who had different
experiences than poker but made it to
the top of their field which now they
can play these high roller tournaments
for fun it's a whole
different experience than the poker
player one which of course I've done
myself I'm familiar with so many people
I feel like it's just uh something
that's kind it's like a art of lost it's
like a art that's lost almost you know
you go into a casino and your host is
going to welcome you you feel like
you're welcomed into this space and you
know you might go play a poker
tournament and no one even said a word
to you it doesn't seem like really much
fun and then the unfortunate side of it
too is a lot of the people who are even
going to be friendly with you are going
to try to invite you to their home game
which is a a whole another horrible
thing for the game which I've I've made
a a lot of friends who are recreational
players I've never made a home game or
tried to invite them to my home game to
make money off of them I see and I think
this is a lot of people in the world
just have this limited approach of
what's best for me right now is the path
that I'm going to take where actually I
think that it's a horrible path the one
that's trying to take advantage of a
person that you fortunately meet in this
scenario so you know you're in this
scenario with clearly intelligent people
that have found a route to make it to
the top and a different one than your
own and you're a poker player who thinks
about all these things and the more
information like you have the better you
can make any decisions so I feel like
why would you ever want to connect with
a good person and try to make a
short-sided move like how can I make
money off of this person instead of like
hey let me see if I actually have a
connection with the person do we think
alike in some aspects and wind up in in
a situation where not not one of the
either is looking to gain advantage on
the other and a lot of times you even
see it where I would see a recreational
player ask a pro you know did I play
this hand like well and they would
really they would just lie to their face
where you know there's so many spots in
poker you can tell a person who's here
playing for fun if they made the correct
play or not not just to save your
whatever you have in your mind for Ev so
I think we've went down kind of a bad
way recently where everything is thought
of more and what's best for me right now
and you're even seeing that in the
industry of online poker giving as
little as they possibly can and kind of
always upping their side upping
Administration fees and fees for
deposits and withdrawals kind of milking
the cow as much as it possibly can
because we're on this like uh I'd say
place that too many of us are thinking
and not just poker in the world but I
guess because I see poker players in a
more advanced so poker players are the
ones who you know accepted a life that
has nothing guaranteed so already they
jumped into something of belief in
themselves and belief to do something
different than the world tells you to do
so and I think it's it's something where
you learn these skills in poker but
unless if you really reflect on the
lessons that you learn and try to
translate them to life you're kind of
just going to miss the whole process of
what you learned and the skill of
problem solving that poker teaches you
can really be applied to anything in the
world because any decision that you're
you're making anything that you're doing
it's all based on the information that
you have and making the best decision in
the moment that you can so poker you
know has you Cal in this setting where
lots of pressure is under you and you
have to make these tough tight decisions
and you don't see many translating it to
life um you know it's interesting life
life is interesting and at the same time
I would say that
I uh rewind to me five years ago and all
I thought about was poker I didn't apply
any of these things really to life I had
in my mind that um I was doing such a
great job and had this balance in life
and was at such like a great point where
then F once I make it let's say a year
out of that you start to think like how
could you have possibly thought you had
any balance the only thing that you were
actually thinking about or doing was
playing poker so and I think it it's
like that you know life is such a
humbling experience really where
especially the harder you try the more
difficult lessons that life is going to
give you but at the same time if you
keep rising to the challenge you know
they'll keep coming and you can keep
growing along this like ladder that
we're on but at the same time if you're
not willing to completely destroy like
the thought of yourself and how you see
almost everything you're going to have a
hard time adapting to The Changing Times
of the world because you know you're
stuck in one kind of thinking and I
just like I think everything relates to
Poker it goes back to like poker too
there aren't many people who really
crushed for 10 10 15 20 years because
they had a style that was good in their
time and the game evolved and usually
they didn't put in the word they kind of
got to the top of the hill let's say you
know a perfect example is Tom dwan who
was killing everybody crushing heads up
kind of got to the top of the hill saw
and got a bit comfortable game changes
and the way way that it changes a bit
you know then comes like the jungle man
a silder era where it's like a new whole
way of thinking that took all of the
ways of Tom's thinking and how he played
and translated it to a new level and he
kind of didn't work on his game he was s
you know sitting at the nose bed games
wasn't getting action wasn't getting to
sharpen his skills while on the same
time no silder was playing all day every
day 24 hours a day sharpening his skills
at the highest level so it's like then
when uh he
they reach like the same point you know
silder was ready for it and Tom really
kind of got lazy on the top of his thing
and it's kind of it's we've seen there
have been a lot of that through poker so
it kind of just highlights more that if
you're not willing to change with the
times the times are really going to eat
you alive if you know you stay stuck in
this way of thinking and way of being so
and then at the same time it's
a h i I don't know if tough is the right
word it's like a beautiful journey of
growth life but it's a humbling you know
rip your whole like thoughts of of
everything apart you know wind up in the
dirt have to pull yourself like out of
it laugh at yourself for you know things
that people might you know go crazy
about but just like pull yourself back
together and you know take all of it and
use it like as a bag of tools for that
next
phase I mean your experience obviously
you know you're sharing your experience
the way you experience life but
obviously you were the guy who said he
was going to become number one right and
you already mentioned yeah that's going
to be quite a humbly road but in in the
same time I think if you set very high
goals this is kind of the benefit then
you can also experienced the most amount
of growth right obviously you've
experienced a lot of variant in your
life but therefore you've all also meant
you you also manag to grow as much as
possible whereas if a lot of people they
just play poker just to get by think
it's kind of a wasted opportunity like
you said you can learn a lot about life
if you set a high goal in poker like for
example becoming number one now not
everyone has to necessarily try to
become number one but at least I think
setting the goal makes you open up your
mind to the possibilities well I want to
become number one well what should I
then try to be doing to become number
one and then if you have the belief that
you can actually become number one when
these obstacles come you just see that
hey these are opportunities to learn
where if someone doesn't really have
that confidence they might see it's like
ah you see it's not for me and they quit
and they go back into comfort and then
they won't have the same experience that
you have right they won't have had the
same amount of growth yeah because if
you're at if you accept comfort then
you're never pushing your limits or
pushing the boundaries that like you've
set out for yourself that are never
comfortable but yeah if you don't go
through it then life is going to be that
you know it'll be a comfortable one that
there won't be much growth you might
watch a lot of sports games and drink a
lot of beer and kind of Coast through
this life without learning much or you
know take the one
that know you might make it to the top
you might make it to the top have like
this high level of like trust in the
community and integrity of yourself and
how you act in all settings and you
might have that just destroyed overnight
in some way that you know you could have
never imagined and you know you just
your whole idea of your self what you're
doing in life it's like back to the
drawing board it's you know you make it
to the top of this mountain and all of a
sudden you know you're wiped to the
bottom again so then it's a it's a whole
another humbling experience
because how you feel and how people
treat you when you're at the top of
anything and then how you feel or how
people treat you when you're at the
bottom is such a different reality that
unless if you really have
that
acceptance of whatever happens and
belief that it's all for like this
greater good and that life
always it's like life tests it gives you
what you can it's like uh what What's
The Saying life gives you uh what you
can handle not what you want so you know
you see yourself as this strong I always
saw myself as a strong person that could
you know carry others on my back let's
say that's kind of how I thought about
it that you know I would carry my family
on my back whatever they need I could
fight for them I was strong enough
focused enough to like keep going up and
then you know you you start carrying
more and more on your back until one day
you know it all crashes on you again too
and this whole like experience that you
could do everything and you could carry
all these people on your back and it's
no problem washes away into like
something new and hey now how am I even
looking at life and how do I how am I
acting how how am I perceived by other
people because you know that's a whole
another thing in itself
where I've always been since my since my
dedication is so much I've always been
very hard on myself to be better to grow
not in the sense that I say bad things
to myself but to the sense that I'm
pushing my limits
continuously while at the same time I'm
doing a lot of good for a lot of people
but while I'm while I was in this chasm
and being from New York I speak fast I
speak direct I see things in a a
different way I kind of can hit to the
Target really where it's like my
thinking
was oh I'm the soft person who enters
like the room I'm always trying to help
everybody you start to realize yourself
later it's like no no you're this like
crazy intense person that's hard on
everyone yes it's because you're hard on
yourself and you're only giving them a
small bit of the hardness that you have
on yourself where at the same time is
that how you want to you know be seen in
the world or can you harness that
intensity and you know be able to spread
the same message with calmness and with
love instead of with sharpness and
directness because since all of us
especially are wired very differently
there are some people that you know if
you hit just straight with harshness and
directness you'll never be able to touch
any bit of like their of them actually
listening to the message that you're
trying to give them where it's like
poker you have to come with a different
approach in every setting that you're in
and unless if you're Mindful and you
even understand what does it mean to
breathe like yeah I know how when first
time someone who you know was a bit more
advanced of breathing or a lot more
advanced of breathing they ask me you
know well like how do you breathe your
first thought like is what do you mean
what the [ __ ] what what do you mean I
bre I breathe like everybody else what
kind of like thought is that how do I
breathe then it's like no no no you
don't understand you're not actually
breathing like you're not breathing
through your nose you're like a mouth
breather you you're not like taking an
air a lot of times you're not mindful of
your breath this whole mechanic that can
work so well to your advantage of
keeping your cool under intense
circumstances and it's like wait you
know I had no idea about this and that's
the amazing thing about life there are
all these different PODS of information
gifts things that you can incorporate
into your way of being to be just a
better version of yourself so this was
the thing right like if you if you for
example set the goal to become number
one and someone tells you hey you're not
breathing right your brain is start to L
wait so if I breathe better I can
concentrate more I perform more Under
Pressure hey I want to become number one
hey that that seems like something you
know whereas if you're just working in
the supermarket you know and and you're
you're you're putting in the bottles in
the sh and someone says hey you're
breeding like yeah okay like what what
is breeding
better can I feel the shell in a in a in
a faster way what like why why why why
would that matter to me but I would
challenge you there because I would say
that it all depends of the determination
that the person that you run into has
for sure because they can be at a point
where they're stalking things in a
grocery store but they might see themsel
at somewhere completely different so
it's like that's why life will kind of
let's say give you but then they see
this breathing as an opportunity for
this bigger picture that they already
have if they don't have the bigger
picture they're not going to
interpretate breathing as a way like
sort of a path or one of one of the
tools that they can use in order to get
to that better life if you get what I
mean oh yeah for sure that's definitely
true which is then they would just go in
the bucket of the people who are looking
for comfort in their life
and might as well count those people out
you know if you're if you're looking for
comfort you know it's probably the wrong
podcast to listen to to be honest yeah
yes no this is definitely not not not a
podcast for Comfort if you want to
talk something yeah imagine if you want
to imagine Big Dreams and you know push
your boundaries and believe what others
might tell you is impossible then I
might be the right cup of tea for you
then this then this is the part to
listen to you mentioned all the way in
the beginning as well right that you get
a lot of motivation out of uh taking
care of your siblings you VI a certain
amount of responsibility this can be
very motivating obviously when it
becomes too much I think like you
experienced it can also just yeah the
weight is too much then it becomes
actually to like pressure I actually had
the same when I was just you know living
living a single life you know was
playing a bit of Poker it was like ah if
it all goes to [ __ ] I'll just go back to
my hometown you know but then suddenly
you know I I got married moved in
together with my wife and I was
supporting my wife financially was like
hey wait oh [ __ ] I actually have to now
do my best because I don't no longer
only feel for for myself and I also feel
for others I do remember this gave me
like a certain amount of motivation that
I think that I think you're describing
as well I also wanted to touch on like
the creativity part that you keep on
coming back to if you want to become
number one and you encounter a problem
let's say you encounter a tough opponent
he's in the way of you becoming number
one if your goal is not to become number
one you might just quit whereas oh if
you want to become number one you have
to go through this guy so it really it
really helps you think on a whole
another level it's like okay quitting is
not an option how am I going to beat
this guy that's when you really start to
think and that's when you can really
come up with more creative strategies
and that's I think nowadays when people
kind of think ah the game is solved
anyway so there's no room well it's more
like it's that mentality that stops you
from being cre creative creative not the
the like the game in the solver area to
a certain degree does but it's way more
how you come it's way more your mindset
I think that limits you in terms of the
creativity than the actual where poker
currently is headed yeah and then but
then I think also
I the way that I saw it is that well
let's start with uh this one mushroom
trip that I had so uh I'm sitting in a
place in Mount Chasta so it's kind of
like in the woods I have this log
cabinets during covid everything is
locked down around the world but I
created this kind of Haven for myself I
set up gym like a nice setting to not
really feel the intensity that the
cities around the world were feeling so
I was sitting there with uh one friend
one day ate like a bit of mushrooms I'm
sitting in the office office and it's
happened multiple times where you know
you're on mushrooms and something asks
you if you have any questions or at
least personally that's what's happened
you know you feel something that the
question is do you have any questions my
response always up until that date was
you know I'm I'm very happy with what
you've given me so far you know just
keep giving me you know what I what I
need in the moment this time I for some
it just popped in my head and I was
doing really well in poker at the time I
think it might have even
been after I became number one so I had
the biggest winning year of all time in
2019 it was just unbelievable year where
I won every big tournament even Main
Event like Aussie Millions too so my
question at this point and it was the
only time I asked the question actually
was why is it that others like in poker
can't compete with me and the response
that I got was because you're not
competing so it made me think of that
because when when you're then talking
about you know if you're trying to
become number one you have to run into
this certain person it's true you're
going to wind up at the table with this
person but at the same time the best
approach may even be to kind of tread
water and not step in too much because
you know you see this someone this
person as someone who's very good and
pots against you thinks well but maybe
you think that their weakness is that
they call too loose against weaker
opponents you almost then can as long as
is not stop stepping on any Minds you
can almost just tiptoe around that
person and just make it through them
instead of feeling like you're actually
in competition with anyone or you need
because you're always W wound up with a
situation to make a decision and it's
only on you to make the best decision
that you can so I guess that message
that they were giving me in this trip
was that my competition and my drive was
always with myself I never thought like
you know you have to out perform this
person or that person or you know this
is your Target and you have to beat them
it's like no no you have you're at a
challenge with yourself to be the best
version of yourself always to make the
right decision in the spot and sometimes
that'll wind up in a hand with this
person play the best that you can and
sometimes you'll wind up in hands versus
other weaker opponents where you can
really maximize the advantages that you
have yeah it's true especially in like
tournaments like obviously this would be
true in a heads up format that's more
like King of the Hill you have to just
go through someone but especially like
you can be a better like someone can be
better in an actual poker hand but if
you construct your strategies if you
maneuver around the table and if you're
better at other aspects you might be the
better player overall it's like
something that that when you were
talking about that it's more about
yourself remember me of an interview of
Conor McGregor where he was fighting I
think Jose Alo and then they were asking
about Jose Alo and he said listen it's
not about Jose Alo you're not against
Jose Alo you're against yourself in
there in the ring he said who the [ __ ]
is it's me against myself he said it's
more like more like a meal game this
kind of what what reminded me it's like
you are kind of only playing against
yourself if you manage to show up good
you can beat anyone that's kind of what
he was trying to say I just focus on
showing up as my best version then I
don't care who comes in my way I will
just you know hit him with my left H
and if you put in the work that you're
more prepared than the person that
you're in there with then you're going
to come out on top over and over again
so I think it was just kind of like that
even though the obstacles of being a
millionaire negative millionaire all
along like that road of to be number one
it's just like um you know you're you're
then just in competition with yourself
to pick yourself up to be better to
perform the places that you show up as
where I then think it's also important
not overe exhausting yourself and having
fun and making sure that you show up
when you feel like you're ready to show
up and not just showing up because you
feel like you have to show
up yeah I've sure many players can
relate the days that you sit down
because you have to sit down might not
really show the same performance as the
day you really feel like hey I'm ready
to perform today it's like a lot of
times you know I even so like uh when I
when I would think about a super high
roller tournament like let's let's say a
the beginning days of that were 100K
buyin that poker stars ran they were
three-day long tournaments
for me uh if you in a full three-day
tournament like uh the Triton one for
example uh it's so intense and you use
so much energy at least personally
myself to get through that that my then
approach really was okay so I know that
the time that I need to be my best is on
day two and day three which means that
if I'm not ready to play that that day
two and three I'm going to be ready to
play my best maybe sit out on day one so
there were many tournaments that there's
a big long series that's going on you
might have ran deep in a tournament
before that always the thought is okay
I've got to jump right in that because I
have EV to jump in and it goes along
like the same GTO strategy and it
doesn't really matter if you're
following a Playbook of what you're
supposed to do because then the Playbook
says you know your exhaustion doesn't
matter the amount of sleep that you have
doesn't matter the amount of water and
food like oh yeah all of these things
are nonsense you know all that matters
is that I've got this chart down that
I've studied in my head and I'm ready to
go to battle then I they think like oh I
I have like a certain B 100 in the early
stages and that's just a number and they
don't it seems like you zoom out more
and like well I have to kind of manage
my energy over three-day tournament I
think I we had a we had a podcast with
Jon aens AKA online and he said actually
the same thing in this tournament I
might like late rack because things are
quite exhausting and I think I heard
very back in the day I heard I think it
was Vanessa SS who was also talking
about this like yeah late rag or in the
in the first day I don't pay too much
attention I don't want to waste too much
energy I am there but you know if I get
a couple hands just try to stack stack
stack the recreational player and that's
it day twoo I start to really focus use
more more of my energy I think this is a
a more holistic point of view that
definitely I think is very very
underrated by the especially the new
school players who just look at the
numbers in the chart
yeah and think that they need to study
between day one and day two and
sacrifice sleep for it that was another
thing that in my mind that's like one of
the most ludicrous things that I could
ever imagine like when I think of what
do I need to perform sleep comes at the
top of the list yeah every single time
so it's like there's there's nothing you
can study in in a break or in in end of
day one to day two that actually going
to give you an edge rest is always going
to give you a bigger Edge
yeah so I was so surprised that you know
these guys that I saw as the same level
as myself you know talking about how
they studied for four or five hours and
then couldn't sleep so only got two
three hours sleep before day two and W
like well I don't want to talk to you
guys too much about this because there
there was another time where um well I
always had like a different thinking
process and I think also that's why you
know maybe other people who have this
GTO approach tell themselves that I
can't be as good or better than they are
because I'm losing 0.1 BB by not
defending Jack four off from the big
blind and winding up in stupid spot
where you're like getting bet PO on the
turn with top pair and now have to wind
up in this like blender spot instead of
just where you think that you have a
huge Edge in decision making versus the
field that you're in there's a whole
grade of Better or Worse to better of
those people always you know you can you
don't have to do anything for something
and you know it it brings back like a
time I forget what year it was it must
have been in like 2013
2015 and it was in Monte Carlo and there
were a lot of high roller players like
it was the time where uh of the Germans
like eigor and filbo were like at the
top and like the the like Tobias Ranken
day and there were like 15 guys who were
playing uh high rollers at the time and
uh Phil Bor just says this story of a
Han that he played in maau in some
tournament and everyone's just on the
same side of yeah you know I would have
played it the same way so I'm like well
I would have actually played it this way
so the start is everyone's like no h you
know I don't think so as I started to
explain my thought process and why I
would have actually played this hand
this way I shifted the whole room into
thinking wow like that makes perfect
sense like I think that's the right way
to play it and that's when like a light
bulb kind of went off my head also of
like you know that's the end of this of
like giving away the I'm not sharing I'm
not sharing anything anymore yeah yeah
so I kind of like became that you know
lone wolf in the high stakes Community
like there are all these groups of
people who study together swap together
talk poker together and then there was
just me showing up like myself not
talking poker to anyone teaching a few
few people poker at certain times always
just playing learning never studying
like also studying just not something
that relates with me you know you tell
me that this poker Journey means that I
have to study all these hours to make it
to like number one I would say ah wrong
person wrong game like uh not interested
not fun let me find something else that
like is actually fun but I mean if you
learn a lot if you for example let's say
you go out and play and some people will
learn from good plays others make and
mistakes that you make let's say for
example you make a mistake or you see
one good play that someone else making
put you in a tough spot you're like hm
you might pick that up straight away and
add it to your game whereas for example
me I might have to make the mistake five
times and I have to face the situation
five times before I learn it so it could
be that you're a very fast learner would
you say that's true in the in in
practice like when you when you're being
too put in tough spots you're like hey I
can probably use this or when you make
mistakes well like one one of the best
compliments I think that I ever got from
like a person was this guy Connor drenan
who was Blanco negro online like uh and
what he to he said that he always would
learn like he would learn a lot from me
and he thought the skill that I had was
that I adapted to the new style of play
and was always ahead of the curve before
others were ahead of the curve so I
guess I had that well I really immersed
my whole life in it I played poker all
day every day didn't really have much of
a life apart from that so I thought
about poker all day every day also like
just my whole Focus was being put on
being better improving so it was always
like adapting in these Changing Times of
the game so I think it then comes down
to because I put so much focus into it I
was more present in the way that the
game was shifting than other people who
were putting less focus on
it yeah now that actually makes a lot of
sense you actually also mentioned was
interesting about what what you
mentioned about the jack for offand
where this is just like you follow the
chart but for example you may taking you
were taking in consideration that oh
let's say for example the best guy who's
left in the field opens the button and
you have Jack for off well maybe your
defend range when you're in the big
blind versus the best guy who opens on
the bottom should maybe look a bit
different than if the worst guy in the
tournament opens on the button right we
have the chart and this is just like a
start place that gives you an idea well
you know given the variables that play
given the equity realization given your
you know your Showdown ability how
effective your Bloss are going to be on
latest Street Etc this is the chart but
obviously you have to estimate for
yourself well for this guy who's way
more passive I can probably realize more
Equity Therefore I Play More hands oh
this guy's very aggressive G to put me
in tough spots maybe you know if I look
ahead like you said Jack for off face
pop bet maybe I'll just fold straight
away yeah exactly let's just not wind up
like in this spot instead of just like
in no man's land making a yes on the
turn versus a guy who's very
capable and the other thing you know I I
would love if you've got an answer for
me okay so let's say you're playing High
Roll super high roller tournaments
probably the biggest winner in the field
let's say has a 20% Roi or something
person who's playing the best like in
the time if you believe to be the best
or one of the best in the field let's
say that you have between 10 and 20% Roi
why would you be taking High Varian
spots where you're winning 0.1
BB I mean that that that depends how how
how certain you are that the play is
good because obviously I think in your
mind it's like well it's very but
there's yeah there's a whole different
thing of like good and has enough value
for the situation that it's going to put
me
in yeah but I mean if you always make
the correct play this is the thing right
it's it's in his
confidence that he will actually make
the correct play in all these situations
because and also it depends on let's say
for example the maximum you think you
can gain by this hand is 0.1 BB but if
you screw it up it's minus minus one
then best case scenario you're and you
have to do it always right you win 0.1
worst case scenario you uh you lose one
then obviously that's not a fair return
right course so you always have to look
at kind of your your risk reward in this
situation but I would say if someone
taking on that spot is because he
believes that that's actually a plus of
spot and he doesn't care if it's 0.1 or
0.5 he just feel like hey I'm being delt
hand but if I it is it is true to a
certain degree that if you take on so
this also depends kind of if you look at
your table and how much future like plus
a spots will be taken in consideration
because 0.1 brings with it a lot of
variants and it could actually knock you
out of the tournament so I would argue
that if the rest of your table if there
is more plus one BB spots then you
should probably avoid the 0.1 one PB
spot because it it increases your risk
of ruin
and you future spots I think a lot of
people Miss exactly what you said right
there I don't need play tournaments that
of I should help me do the tournament
work of course there's there you know if
you want if you put yourself in a spot
that you think that you're playing with
you know that you're one of the five
best players in the world and you're
playing with the other four best players
in the world you know you have to take
every plus zero .1 BB spot that you
possibly have but that's never really
the case so even if you wind up in a
table you know with one weak player in
your mind two weak players in your mind
and you're taking these big blind spots
that are winning 0.1 BBS but the
opponent that you're up against is
betting pot like almost all the time on
the turn you know your like Risk ruin is
nightmare in my mind to get such little
of an edge oh yeah especially in
tournaments like again you can go back
to like a more bigger picture approach
and I would say that's definitely true
like for example in a cash game that
doesn't really work like that to some
degree you could make an
argumentation is gonna play for an hour
and you know I want to get more as much
hands in with the recreational so this
could be true so you could actually pass
on minus slightly winning EV spots pre
flop just to get more hands recreational
yeah that that is that is an argument
but I agree with you that in a
tournament you have to probably zoom out
uh way more so I agree actually with
with your with your philosophy here it
really depends on what other
opportunities there are to to make money
but exactly what what you're describing
here is just like the chart expects a
certain amount of equity realization and
for example if you give if you make a
pref up chart and you give the turn a
pop bet or an overb or if you limit that
to three quarters well guess what if you
limit it to three quarters we can now
suddenly defend more hands because we
don't face that pop B so it sounds like
you're you're really good at kind of
mapping out looking ahead in hands but
also in the whole tournament like not
even this hand but like future hands so
you kind of look around and see what the
opportunities are and try to maneuver
yourself in these more plus of
opportunities and kind of avoid the
marginal highrisk to Rune spots that's
kind of how it sounds like yeah because
then you know another thing it goes back
to that you can relate poker to life
always it's like in this poker
tournament you have a limited amount of
resources that there's exactly what you
have right there so you have to use your
resources like in the way because your
goal is that you can't run out of
resources so if that is you know winding
up in lots of tough spots it's going to
be very tough because yeah you might
make some good decisions some bad ones
but if you wind up kind of trying to
steer away from those like ruined spots
versus people on your level or close or
maybe confident at that time or feeling
good that day you know another thing
I've never heard anyone else talk about
in poker is you know I would walk into a
high roller tournament and what I would
do is really map out the room before the
event even starts and I would have a
feeling of who's confident who's winning
who's losing who you should go after
that day who you should stay away from
and before the tournament even starts
I've got like a strategy versus
different people in my head now your
table formulates and you have these
people and now you have this approach of
based
on the presence that the the presence
and calmness that the p and confidence
that the person is in that day and then
how you want to steer your own you know
ship in which direction but but if you
think about it this it this to me makes
perfect sense because what you're saying
is a more let's say for example you play
versus me when I feel more confident I'm
going to play my aame that means I'm
going to take up better spots if I play
against a hand to you and I keep on
making better decisions that's going to
cost your a v so your defend range or
your vpip range or whatever range the
range that you're going to play against
me should look different based on if I'm
confident or not because that's going to
determine how effective your plays are
going to be and how much pressure I'm
going to be putting on you because if
I'm underc confident and might be giving
up more Rivers for example therefore you
get to call down with lower pairs
because you get to Showdown more often
right yeah yeah plus then like since I
allowed my like creativity to to run
wild let's say there are many more
possibilities of things that you can do
and maneuver with that you know someone
else might dictate as you know that's
just inherently wrong where there are so
many actually pieces to that to say
something is right or wrong because
you're not in a vacuum you know exactly
but when when he says it's wrong it's
true the lens and the variables that
he's calculating in his head that make
up for a plus if or minus if you play
where for example in in the jour German
where where you kind of throw your
examples out you probably threw some
variables out there that suddenly shift
his range to a completely different
range that they were perceiving and like
ah given this information that you just
gave and these variables and his range
actually looks like this you're probably
right this is a better play yeah well
plus because you're at War too so you
know any way you can almost influence
your opponent's thinking in the wrong
direction the better you're going to do
in war so you know I think I've only
spoken about it one time before and
maybe you heard of it
um D I lost my train of
thought well we're going to war you said
I'm very curious what's going to
follow I like fell off let's hope this
doesn't happen when you're actually at
War oh okay I got it again I knew I'd
get there again okay so you know for
example for a long time people were
playing online and they use poker
tracker so the way that they thought was
really based on the numbers that they
saw that you played it was the early
days of Poker tracker they didn't have
all these intricate numbers that they
have today it might not work you know
what I did in the times of today but
what I would do is anytime I was playing
a buyin that was the smaller size of my
range I would play this absolutely
insane game to just throw my numbers
completely off of how often I open how
often I three bet like uh my numbers
were just like so skewed in the opposite
side which was just like uh trying to
make people think incorrectly in the big
spots that they wound up having against
me where then when I graduated to live
poker and I was playing 250 million bin
100K bayans what I would then I I still
continued the same approach in the 25k
tournaments I played some of the most
insane hands ever and people just had it
then in their mind that they've seen me
do this in in this spot versus this
person in this exact same scenario and
then I just wind up tightening my range
in like the higher stakes and just have
it over and over again when the stakes
are four to 10x the size so it was like
your advertisement budget
yeah and I you know you if you look at
everything right in front of you you're
looking to make and then you know of
course everything in poker relatable to
life you know it's like if you're
looking at it right in front of you and
trying to make the most TV in the moment
that you're in right now you miss out on
the big picture and what you could
actually gain from the situation that
you're in where if you know you take a
step back pass on some of these plus EV
potential spots for a bigger picture for
a different
reason you wind up maybe navigating your
River
easier this is uh this is this some some
very smart stuff what what what I used
to do and like the guys that I used to
play with what we would do if we would
figure out okay we're playing against
someone who's also very exploitive us a
poker tracker instead of like basing my
decision on his hot stats I would then
look at my own hot stats and based on my
own hot stats figure out well if I play
against myself would I be more likely to
do this for Value as as a bluff and then
you can kind of well I know that I don't
do this and I know that you look at my
game so actually I'm now gonna do this
because I never do this and vice versa
so then you get whole and the other
guy's just he's just look at just say
like n he never blow ha fault but like I
looked at my stats and I know I never
Bluff here therefore I Bluff because I
know you're looking at my stats it's
like you know and he like now now
there's probably some more news kit
solver kids listening it's like oh yeah
I didn't know the Go the game went
deeper than uh than than just following
the charts yeah yeah I hope I hope you
know we're triggering you know we're
having a more creative conversation I
hope we're triggering more fun in people
uh I want to I want to quickly um bring
it back to you mentioned that now you
prioritize sleep your health right
because I guess you realized that yeah
you perform better when your healthy
surprise surprise but the first your
poker your first year of your PO career
mention you were very overweight right
you're just clicking clicking buttons
when when was like the first big success
that you had when you started your
professional poker career so I think you
mentioned you played for a whole year
online uh you you missed the W CP event
you were like [ __ ] this school is
messing up with my w CP schedule I'm out
when was like the first big success that
you had in poker like actually right
away when I started playing on Poker
Stars I
uh the first night actually I ever
played on Poker Stars I deposited $50
and by the end of the night I was
playing 100 200 limit hold him with like
uh 4K it was the biggest game on Stars I
had 4K in my account and you even had it
was the time where uh you had to request
to play in the game and you would get a
call from Lee Davey really who is Poker
Room manager at the time kind of vetting
you to see that you could you know
afford the swings of 100 200 100 limit
so he gets me on the phone he's like hey
you know with this 4,000 balance you
know it can go really fast in the game
and I was like oh you know don't worry I
got lots more where that came from where
you know that was all the money that
that I just you know threw a random 50
bucks on there that I you know before I
ever made any money so I wound up losing
that that night in 10000 the next week I
deposited a little bit again I won a $3
Reby I think for
3,000 or so within the
next six months I was back to 100 200
limit spinning like a a roll from
nothing to 250k and losing it all so
that was I was probably I started at say
at maybe 19 was the time I did that
where I spun and lost like
250 uh the first time and then I I
played a few tournaments that I could a
Turning Stone tournament in Upstate New
York it was just a 1K buy I was 19 years
old that was my first Cash ever for
30,000 or so I think in the next year I
went and cashed the WPT and Niagara
Falls uh but it was the first time I
spun up a million dollars playing poker
I was 20 years old uh that was gone
within the
year uh then i' I think by the time I
spun up that the next one might have
been that three and a half spin up that
I think
was like
22 maybe I was and I was just like kind
of lingering around like from then kind
of just had
this build up to something lose it all
go back from scratch build it up again
lose it all again just like uh keep
having fun and keep
playing I hope you guys are enjoying the

your poker goals in
2024 uh I'm very curious Adam when was
the last time you turned a million into
zero and went back to a million again
never for me as well never so may maybe
we haven't taken of enough risk in our
[Laughter]
careers yeah it's not it's not for all
yeah I'd love to dive in here because I
feel like your story is so unique and
normally I try to pin pinpoint like one
rock buttom moment and we try to focus a
bit of the conversation on that but for
you there's just rock bottoms everywhere
and I really want to talk about how you
navigate these because I think it's
gonna be super important for the
listener and you mentioned something H
can you hold on to the roller coaster
and I want to dive into that so for you
we've got these massive Peaks making a
million losing a million making a
million losing a million and this is
happening a lot like it's never happened
to me never happened to Renee probably
never happened to most people listening
but for you this is quite a normal thing
and you mentioned you are good at
digging yourself out of a hole so I want
you to talk to us about how you deal
mentally and what you do on a practical
level
when you do go from plus a million to
negative a
million yeah so actually it it pops up
into my mind like and I'll I'll try to
navigate through an exact like scenario
and how I was feeling and how I got
through it in the time this was maybe
the third time that I went from
millionaire to negative to then built it
up again and lost it all again I was in
London and it was kind of crazy actually
because I started that year I'd lost it
all started that year with a very small
amount really just grinded through it
and by the time that time in September I
was looking at maybe a mill maybe
exactly a million dollar role again and
I had a friend who was doing um some
business that kind of convinced me that
it was you know something that I should
get
into uh and the business was actually on
paper doing really well the person who
got me into the business I think didn't
really manage it fairly
and took advant you know a lot of people
are out there to take advantage of you
unfortunately so I wind up in that spot
where uh so at this time I was actually
on a high from poker I had like a
million dollars I was winning and I had
on paper that this other deal was
supposed to go through and on this other
deal I had another one and a half
million that was coming to me but I had
to guarantee like some of it and the way
that it was managed by the person who
set up the deal
was I can't imagine any way that other
than it was set out for with bad
intentions you know but at the same time
I put like my word and my name on it so
I wind up that I I find out that the
deal that the deal just went bad so not
only am I not getting the one 1.6 mil
like that was coming to me from that
deal but I vouched for like uh a big
number of like that deal so then I had
to go from okay I'm on this High I'm
winning in poker I'm feeling
great now it all really crashes down I
now I'm in a spot where the million that
I have it's if if I'm going to honor
what I agreed to do I've got to pay the
whole million and I'm
in I have to I think I was maybe
negative a million and a half to two
million or something was the thing that
was agreed on so uh I'm in London at the
time and you know it I would never say
it wasn't devastating it was complet
completely devastating so you know not
to not to downplay it and say oh you
know piece of cake whatever frush
through it but the thing that I did do
was you know I said to myself that no ma
and I have this approach that I say to
myself that no matter what whatever's
happened has already happened and if you
want to progress and move along this
mountain you have to accept that you
can't let it hanging over your head you
can't let that dictate your
existence and your opportunity to attain
higher levels of yourself and life let's
say so I said to myself I was in this
flat in London and I said okay the deal
is uh when you leave this flat you have
to just accept it and forget about it so
during that week I really shut off my
phone I just wanted to disconnect from
everything I you know ordered some Nando
some like you know nice delivery Foods
in London I smoked a lot of weed I
watched just you know movies things to
take my mind off of it and I would say
that I was able to leave that apartment
and instead of looking at it as
something that's you know like a thorn
in me or something that's dragging me
down use it as armor and take it with
you to make you stronger so that
happened in uh early SE early October of
that year so know there was a bit of a
period where you know you need to
decompress a bit there were no
tournaments or nothing that was going on
because W Coupe just ended there was
nothing really for the next month and a
half so I wind up in um I think it was
the first Triton that I ever played in
Manila um remember the year
2016 it must have been yeah 2016 it was
and I flew over to Manila I actually
flew the night of my birthday I spent my
birthday November 1st uh with my family
in New York my flight was on November
2nd at two in the morning from New York
to go to Manila I got there I wound up
getting second place in the main event
there but um so not many people really
knew what had happened to me
because I kind of keep to myself like in
poker I don't broadcast like um myself
or things that are going on much so most
people don't really
have an idea about me they might think
that they do but unless if they've
listened to like my way of thinking in
this podcast they probably are way off
so I'm hanging out with one of two
friends that knows about what happened
and in Manila he just looks at me and he
says he's just like he pounds me and he
says you know uh if you would asked me I
would have been sure that you come here
you start complaining about this and
that and in this like type of mood it's
like as soon as I saw you when you got
here you just had like kill in your eyes
like you just had Focus I didn't hear a
single word about you know this bad
thing that happened to me so I think
that uh people
recreate uh trauma or difficult
scenarios that they go through into
their present moment and it kind of
haunts their whole existence and unless
if you really if you're on this journey
that you trying to be the best version
of yourself hoping for you know great
things in whichever way you want
them it's
gonna you're going to have to have like
you know that strength that armor to
make it through the tough times and if
you just you know a lot I would say a
lot of people give their power away
claiming to be a victim of Life instead
of grasping their own power that exists
in life and if you go that that route
and blame your environment you blame
people you blame luck for the reason why
you're not at the place that you want to
you're going to have no there's no
chance that you're actually going to get
there but if you can just hone it all
except that you're going to continuously
make mistakes you know not let them
drown you but allow them to enable your
growth into a better version of
yourself then you can uh you can
probably go on this road
there's a level of acceptance there
which is fascinating and I wonder for
you is this been something that you've
throughout your life being good at where
things go badly you've been able to just
go okay this is it can't change it and
move on quickly and then you've been
able to transition that to Poker or is
it something that you picked up during
the swings during the down swings
because the way you described it there
sounds perfect just put it to bed leave
the room and go right the million's done
on to the next thing and try to be
present in the moment however for most
people who try that they will hold on to
the story they'll hold on to the baggage
they'll take that negative energy from
what's just happened the victim mode
that you talked about and they'll try to
forget about it but they can't really
accept what just happened because it
feels unfair to them but for you it just
feels like you're able just go back into
the moment as your friend notice than
you you have the killer more than your
eye have you always been able to accept
when things go bad in
life um I think that it's because I I
don't really see it as going bad because
I've been so blessed always like even I
have like this root of myself that is is
just kind of always been happy with life
with how things are I feel like I have
like you know no trauma or difficult
things that happened as a childhood so I
see like the difficulties that I go
through I see them
as softer than like you know
some difficulties that some people go
through and I think then what I what
like popped up
was um you know like life giving you
what you what you can manage uh so I
think that from a young age like my
whole reality was very intense uh like I
come from amazing upbringing but there's
five of us I'm the oldest and my parents
and I would say that everyone's very a
very unique and intense individual and
we all grew up in a small space so
things were even though there was lots
of love around there was intensity so
it's like my I was
um or like I
um I came in contact with intensity at
like early age and I didn't shy away
from it I accepted it where if I said
you know this is too intense life
wouldn't really be able to continue like
that ladder of intensity so I feel like
because I accepted intensity was focused
on growth even through that storm life
as it progressed knew that I could take
higher and higher levels of
intensity so it's like since I you know
accepted it's um was it Choose Your Own
Adventure my adventure is like the
intense adventure for sure even even
something like when I was in high
school um I was not well-liked by the
other guys in the school and it was
really nothing other than I dress
differently than they did and I was
confident in myself and just comes to
the you know people hate what they don't
understand so I feel like know it's a
whole different experience for everyone
I feel
like I get a bit of that I've always
gotten a bit of that you know from High
School from you know being the top of
anything with having confidence that
some people would you know look at
confidence and say well why does this
person deserve to have confidence when
I'm sitting here like feeling terrible
about myself but at the same same time
you know if you want to change your
reality you know you should you you want
to actually focus on okay well what can
I learn from this person instead of okay
I want to try to bring them down with me
that's why you see people who are
winners in life they don't badmouth
other people real people who are
confident and are confident in
themselves and they don't Focus or
really you learn not to care what other
people think about you so then that's
like then there's a whole different
level of that so I had that as a child
where you know I was just confident in
the way that I was myself that even
though these people were projecting this
other feeling towards me I did I let's
say created uh something that I didn't
let it get to me so I was able to know
manage that well and then just in the
same way you progress in levels so it's
like uh then that was the point of you
know people saying something to your
face maybe talking behind your back then
because I progressed through that level
and I guess for whatever humbling reason
reasons that it needed to happen and
that it was meant to happen it's like
then when I went through when I went
through that time where Martin just
blasted me on the internet that's like a
whole new level of that same type of
story where you know here can you now
it's a whole different picture you know
before it was in your high school hall
rooms there was people in this small
circle that knew you it was people in
some small community now like the whole
world who have has really no idea about
you because you don't really talk much
and keep to yourselves now this new
picture has been put out which in my
opinion couldn't be farther from like
the picture of reality but then you have
to go through this period also
where you know you're at like a higher
level of this difficult game that you're
in and you know it's you can't say it's
anything other than [ __ ] you know the
the things that because for me okay to
go for to be someone that existed in
negative Bank roles there has to be a
reason that you're able to get into
negative Bank roles my whole reason that
I was able to to get credit to stay in
action when I didn't have money is
because people trusted me trusted my
Integrity knew if I won that I would pay
them instantly I might have made them
money like playing or them buying a
piece of me and something and it was
able that was like how I could maneuver
my credit line my whole existence always
from poker has been okay the most
important thing is your integrity and
your word and staying like true to them
not just because where it's going to get
you there these are the things that were
just really always important to me I
think I I really self-examine myself a
lot you know sometimes you're warp speed
into some way that you don't really see
it for like a little bit but really try
to be introspective and at the same time
uh willing to take constructive
criticism from from the people around
you so know now I'm in this spot where
the things that I deem the most valuable
and held myself the most accountable to
now I'm being run through the mud that
I'm this other person and because a lot
of people like to equate or like to
imagine that the reason why someone had
success is because they were taking
advantage or they had some they were
cheating or doing this and the other
which then the crazy thing comes is even
though the allegations that he said
against me there had nothing to do with
my playing and any of the money that I
actually won from
poker it branded that okay now it's you
know Brinn Kenny the the cheater and
alleged cheater is everything that I
heard every time that it came on and it
doesn't matter if you know it came from
one source and you dealt with a thousand
people in your life and you know if you
grilled tons of successful poker players
they'd say that I ran an aboveboard ship
for my whole life and never asked anyone
to do anything but then it doesn't
matter really after you know all of this
it really doesn't matter because it all
just like crashed on you so now like to
explain yourself and to try to prove
yourself innocent is really you know
something you're like fighting with the
wall again so it's like okay well how
can I just like even though it's
something that's difficult to accept how
can I accept that this happened reality
is different than it was yesterday and
what can I take from this experience and
learn from it and like
because my whole mindset has well the
way I see it is you learn the most in
your most difficult times and I always
saw it that way in poker so it's like
okay can I take those lessons in poker
now and kind of translate into life and
accept now it's like the higher level of
also it's like all of those things
interjecting at the same time like the
level that you're at of acceptance of
what's happened the level that you're at
of you know being of people talking
about you all of these different like
levels that you've reached the point
that it could hit here somehow hits for
a reason for I would say for a humbling
experience for you to be able to because
I would say what it what it then does is
since the real truth of things is you
can focus on yourself you can't really
focus on anyone else and if you focus on
yourself and you prove the person you
are that's you know you you don't live
to the standards of what anyone can see
so then it's like but can you live the
same type of way when it's all you know
Firestorm around you and it's like
another it's like another thing it's
um it's difficult you I wouldn't I
wouldn't wish it on anyone at the same
time I wished it on myself I guess while
you know ask asking for this like
Rocky not rocky road but different road
that makes it
to somewhere that has much more
challenges but amazing wow it's so so
interesting listening you speak it's uh
so inspiring to hear how you navigate
life and how you deal with adversity
yeah so fascinating how you are able to
use adversity to as you mentioned armor
up and it's all in this big Quest just
become a better version of yourself and
playing this leveling game which yeah I
think is super fascinating
well it's like Life's a video game right
so it's just like you know and why not
be the and I I think I fail so much I
guess that's too why like life is also
always humbling even for the people that
are trying the hardest because when
you're in in the moment you see things
in like this vacuum almost that it's not
till you can pull yourself out of it
that you really see yourself and see the
way that you
are
yeah yeah the bigger picture yeah of
what it's all for and yeah I love how
you mentioned as well like everything
happens for a reason and life's hitting
you at the point you're at to give you a
test that will either humble you or
you'll learn from and it's exactly
what's supposed to happen at this moment
there's no avoiding it this is it and
it's pass fa and you either move on to
next level or you stay where you are and
as you mentioned with your kind of
Journey these kind of why am I keep
going negative a million there was
lessons that were happening during that
that allowed you wanted to deal with it
to learn from it but it was a kind of
something you had to learn from to to go
to the next level so you didn't return
back to that that point for sure and
then I don't want to get into it too
much right now but then there's like a
whole another thing of I see something
of where I want to be in the future
so all of the things in the past are for
a
greater good in my mind yeah so it's
like because I have this and then then
to like throw in the same since I have
this experience that if I see something
I can turn it into reality you know
everyone has a different experience my
experience is that anyone can say
whatever they want about that but you
know I saw it in Magic I made it reality
I saw it in Boker I made it reality so
for me it's like that's just really
truth so if I can see something down the
road even if it's something that's so
big I've harbored like that belief from
the experience that I have that nothing
really is to too big and now it's just a
new road that life put you on that has
all of these different twists and turns
to see if you can hold on to the ride
and until where it goes love it and like
then it's like the fuel too that's like
the fuel to get you there since like
that end for me
personally equates to helping as many
people doing as much good as possible
then that means that if I give up up no
matter how difficult the situation that
I'm in right now it means my real dream
and goal of this life is impossible and
then why did I do everything that I've
done to get to here to give
up so powerful yeah I love that so that
was amazing I listen to you speak about
your journey and it reminds me of the
hero's journey I'm sure you're familiar
with that concept and for you the
journey is quite clear to get to the top
of the mountain and be like the number
one player in the world and for you it's
about leveling up your character to to
get to that end point and I think it's
really fascinating as you mentioned that
every time you're at a certain level
life challenges you life challenges you
to grow to get better and you've got to
improve to almost like past that level
to get to the next one it's like the
video game analogy of leveling up your
character and for you I think what's
been very interesting to listen to is
how much you were aware are you even
aware now but as the journe is unfolding
you aware there's a bigger Journey going
on there's a bigger Mountain I'm
climbing and this is all part of of the
bigger picture I I think people really
struggle with this because they get so
absorbed in what is happening now and
the current moments the mood of the
current moment the intensity of the
moment becomes the narrative for the
bigger picture but for you it seems like
you can always zoom out and detach and
see where you're trying to get to long
term so what allows You In the Heat of
the Moment to detach from it a little
bit and to see the bigger picture you
mentioned as your your childhood you you
were around intensity a lot so you got
used to being around intensity but it
seems like this ability to have a wider
perspective and to see this as part of
the path is has been strong for you so
how have you been able to develop that
or this being a natural trade of
yours no it's just like anything it
really had to develop like over time and
I guess let's let's go through another
uh mushroom experience that I had uh on
the beach in Miami so uh this time I was
just like having a good time and the
thing that that came to me was that my
life was three parts of like a whole
let's say three different shells that
phase one of my life was me as a poker
player phase two of my life was me as a
businessman and phase three of my life
is me let's say charity man or giving
back like U so everything that I do
every part of this like intense
experience it's like like you really
said it's like towards climbing that
mountain that's in the background that
even though you know others might not
see it or imagine that it's there and
only see what's like in your present
right now it's like everything in my
present the way that I see it is part of
that like future of the way that I see
it and it's like that road that I'm on
that I asked for so you know what's I
guess you know since since I've had
crazy dreams before you know the way
really my dream is to run the biggest
charity in the world and one that's like
really a version of a charity that has
you know probably people that are poker
minded towards like the let's call it
the board of that company the ones who
fa let's say hold resources and are
tasked to do as much good as they
possibly can with the resources that
they hold so you know a lot of
unfortunately the way charity exists now
like you guys know I'm sure it's a lot
of big corporations that pay a lot of
people and a lot of the money that is
collected by them doesn't actually make
it to the people that are in need and
that need help so I kind of see it as
okay you know poker that's like the
first part and I'm I need to take the
skill so there's a reason that life put
me as a poker player as that first part
of the journey to learn the skills and
to translate those skills from poker to
business to life
[Music]
to then make it to so then it was really
another hum insanely humbling experience
you know of transitioning from myself as
a poker player to a businessman because
there I am at the top of this mountain
in poker now I jump into business I have
no idea about business you know the only
reason I really could even imagine doing
it is that I'm just incredibly
determined and I don't look at things on
paper and say okay well what do I have
today and is it even possible that I
could take what I have today into what I
want so you know if we if we start like
the the Journey of me creating four
poker it wasn't called four poker in the
beginning but so what wound up happening
is in
2018 uh I meet with the guys at GG poker
and my first interest was that I wanted
to open a skin on their Network I
thought that they had good software and
I thought that there was a big hole in
the industry I was telling people prior
to that that I thought it was very ripe
to make a great poker product that you
could challenge the people that were in
the space at that point Poker Stars
really wasn't doing anything it
was was kind of taking candy from a baby
scaling up like that GG like offering
from when I start so I didn't open a
skin because I I would have needed to
run customer support payments get a
license and at that time I was in my
mind one step away from number one all
time and the only thing that I thought
about was to be number one all time but
what wound up happening from that is a
few months later uh they offered me just
to be the the face of the company I
accepted it just thinking that I would
get paid a decent amount of money to
represent them I liked their software I
liked what they were talking about what
they the way they thought about poker
and growing it actually in those early
days when I
started their biggest tournament was a
$500 tournament with a 10K guarantee I
really uh I architected their whole um
maybe not low stakes offering but any
offering from $100 up I architected
really the whole whole schedule I scaled
the guarantees I got the whole Community
to sign up so I get to this point where
um I have I don't maybe it wasn't the
biggest but I'm pretty sure it was the
biggest agency in the world like uh now
I'm I was just wound up become I never
thought of myself that I would become an
agent but I wound up becoming an agent
for GG I think I built it uh there might
be some guys who built something bigger
than me but it's with like a whole train
of sub agents so you know they might
have built something that has 40 sub
agents and there's 100 agents like in
their scheme that maybe equals out to
bigger than what I built myself but I'm
very sure that no one built something
like as one agent the size of what I
built so at that time I had a friend in
Dubai who um I thought knew a lot about
software development and he was seeing
uh what I was doing with that and he
just said wow you know you need to build
your own so you know the crazy person
that I am I'm like oh yeah you know how
hard could that be uh even even though I
had some people telling me you know
you're crazy for like uh doing this how
hard it is is is crazy so the way that
it started was with this one friend and
he was going to hire a team of
developers in India and they were going
to build me this game that I wanted um a
year into that I found out that this
person that I thought was my friend was
really
just make like uh making up stories
pretending like he was putting amount of
time into the project like I would then
connect with the team over there and he
just wasn't
so I wind up in this spot I have to
break free of him I know nothing about
business I know nothing about technology
I all I know is about poker so I have to
break through this person but at the
same time I connect with someone else at
a at a poker table who kind of has the
same experience whereas if I would have
if I would have not met this other
person I would have had to just shut
down what I had because I had no idea
idea how to build anything how to manage
a team so I was able to actually bring
this guy along bring in some he was
actually closing down his business and I
brought him in and his company and there
was there were so many different points
of I wouldn't say highs and lows it was
like different points of lows and lows
it was like it went from low to lower to
lower to lower to lower where I'm like
this lunatic who's just carrying this
thing on his back has no idea like where
he's going doesn't have anywhere close
to the necessary resources to like
actually make it to a point that could
bu that anyone could do anything or
build something of like the level that
you're imagining so because then it
comes down to the other point if you
look on paper of what existed then and
you look on paper today of what exists
today you would say that it's impossible
to get from A to B or not a to let's
call it a to z because there were a
whole different of letters that hit
along like that road of different people
and things that had to be shut down
moved out fire this guy like be and then
it's tough too because you build these
relationships with people in business
also and then next thing you know you
kind of have to like let them go and
before you know you were buddies hanging
out and now you're this young kid who's
like letting go of people who have been
in business for 20 30 years and that's
another like tough thing on on them so
it's like if I would have looked at it
on paper I would have shut it down a
million times all over somehow I made it
to a point where I didn't have a single
strong I I started at a point where I
didn't have a single like let's say very
strong poker developer that was on my
team and somehow I was able to make it
to the point now where
I would say if you did a a survey of the
best Engineers that ever existed at
poker stars I've got like eight of the
let's not be too cocky I've got at least
five of the best like 10 maybe eight of
the best 10 that have ever been there
fortunate like all really came from the
person who was the leader of that
engineering team at the time and him
believing in the project and having just
enough really pieces together that made
it attractive enough for him and then to
bring the people in that he respected
and also that respected him so it's like
um all of these like impossible things
happening that just somehow happen at
these inflection points where it's like
okay well you know I just have to
believe because there's nothing else
that I could do that the right person is
going to walk through this door tomorrow
next week next month to be able to pick
up the pieces that we have rearrange
them a bit put them at a better point
and move it forward like to the next
place so it's been so it's been really a
humbling experience especially to go
from you know I had in my mind and I
don't know why I would think this but
because I had this like crazy like
tumultuous Journey up that mountain for
poker I was like okay you know
everything should be a bit more calm
it's like ah you know I thought too
quick kid you know I thought this was
tough let's move you into like this
place because you know in your old place
before you know if you were in a tough
point it was only you and yourself and
as a poker player and you didn't have
all these hanging things like around now
you start a business you have 50 people
100 people working for you every single
one of those people rely on you their
families rely on you so it's like then
taking that same thing of the not give
up mentality not letting the things like
drag you down no matter like how tough
the storm is and just like keep moving
forward when you can and it's just I
think it's just a belief of our of our
ability to make magic happen but at the
same
time we can't determine like when
something's supposed to happen we can
imagine like a dream set ourselves out
on the path the way that that's going to
unfold you have no way so and then I
guess the other thing that I come back
to is you can think that things are
difficult in a moment moment but you
have to also remember that you can only
see a very small bit of the picture
that's unfolding and the story that
you're in so the story that you're in if
you believe everything is for your
greater good these difficult times are
actually necessary to get you forward so
like you actually if you don't accept
them then you know why did you why did
you ask for
this difficult thing to to re like this
difficult mountain to climb if you
thought it was going to be you know you
know an easy one that you could sit down
all along the
way this is so powerful for anyone
listening and I think for yourself like
it's so clear that you dream big and you
set this dream as like the goal
destination to go for and you stay the
course you stay the path and you don't
know how it's going to unfold and
almostly the harder it gets the more
you're like well this is just tpping me
up you mentioned armoring up a few times
of get me stronger this is exactly what
I need I've got a question of do you
ever doubt the dream do you ever think
wait a second Maybe the dream I had for
some of the poker site maybe that was
just a bit too far out maybe that wasn't
the path for me and I can keep going and
not get there was there any any doubt do
you ever have doubts with the the big
destinations that you set for
yourself I think like well it's
interesting because in the beginning
when I really didn't like map this out I
just went with the belief that it could
happen and that it was possible I
couldn't have any doubt I didn't have
any understanding even of what it meant
to run a business to build like software
I was just like jumping straight in
fresh as like a a newcomer then also the
other thing to like include in that is
there are Al there are always going to
be times
that you that the idea not even that you
think that but all these ideas always
come up in your head some of them you
grasp some of them you don't because
some like you relate to and some you are
just like ah you know that's not for me
to think but then if really believe that
everything happens for a reason when you
wind up in a situation where things are
very tough you have to just like
surrender to what's supposed to be so
like life kind of not like makes you
like ask for Mercy almost but
um so so where I was going with that was
like um you have to get to the place
like that you surrender really so things
are so tough like you have to Just
Surrender with with like what is so
there were definitely points through it
where it was like well you know since
you have to you you accept everything
that is you know if this doesn't work
then it's not meant to work and even
though that you saw it and you felt it
and believed it you know it's maybe you
were wrong this time it's like okay well
I guess that's another humbling part of
like life maybe you know it's not always
like that that you know what you see you
can actually create and know maybe you
have to accept that some is bigger than
you wasn't necessarily meant to be there
at like the time so it's like a mix of
belief because then it's weird too
because it's like the belief and the
surrender is almost opposite but almost
intertwined
completely yeah I can relate to that and
I think people often struggle with the
word surrender because it seems passive
or even acceptance because it seems like
it's passive but I think for yourself
it's very obvious that you're
surrendering the how it's going to
happen you're surrendering when it's
going to happen you're surrendering the
the destination of what's going to how
it's going to unfold but the vision the
belief is right there so you're
surrendering the path you're like life
take me away I'm going to go whatever
way I think I think you're taken me
there I think that's the destination
maybe you've got a different path and we
end up somewhere else but I Surrender it
all and at the same time it's also you
show up daily I think as well this is a
another part where people miss the part
of the equation where surrender doesn't
mean you just leave everything to chance
you've got to show up in the Melting Pot
every day and put the work in that's
needed to just that next step as you
mentioned you don't even know what it is
some times but being in the fire of the
moments and just move trying to move
forward trying to move the situation
forward and this brings me to uh another
skill of yours which we haven't went
into yet the skill of being present and
I think in these scenarios especially
when the sky is fallen so to speak it's
very hard to be present because life
pulls in you there's a lots of
emergencies I think pocket players
listening uh on a downswing you're
losing a large part of your role you
want to stay present in the moment but
life has kind of compounded on you a
little bit so for you I'm curious to
know um how you you stay present in the
moment when life is unfolding in a a way
that's not to your liking let's call it
not a bad way so let's say you're one of
your massive swings or building a pocket
site and you then have to be present of
super highroll of tournament but there's
things generally on your mind or
situations unfold on you how do you be
present when life is
chaotic well I think one thing too
that's interesting is sometimes you know
you if you hold yourself to this like
um this that you're supposed to be
present and at your best all the time
you're guaranteed to fail I think
sometimes along that Journey you know
you're going to wake up in days where
you have really nothing you have no
energy you have really no ability to do
anything at that time and it's just like
surviving is what you need to do so it's
like sometime like when you're going
through the mud you really just have to
survive sometimes try to grasp as any
type of fun or laughter that you can
bring into it but also just like except
that it's going to be draining sometimes
and sometimes you're not going to want
to get out of bed and you don't have to
say you know I have to be my best every
day because you can't be your best every
day but at the same time I always I
think call on
myself to rise to like rise to the
moment that we're in which means like
yeah just no matter what like you're
given you just do the best that you can
like in that time you just get through
it uh sometimes really well sometimes
you know you might have to be dragged
through the floor just to get through it
and it's like that humbling experience
of it all too is where it's like if you
think you know it's going to go this
certain way it's just not you know life
will probably even like laugh at you
just because you think it's it's going
to go this certain way it's going to
push you somewhere else just to okay
yeah you know you thought you knew but
sorry kid
um and then I think that it's just
like I get to the place that we like
this is the one whatever else that
exists you know afterlife pre-life like
the one thing that we know is that we're
in this life right now and the
opportunity that we have is right here
and that's
all that's really for sure anything else
unless if you see it feel it may maybe
it is maybe it isn't but this is what
you have so it's like uh I think that
same part of using your power in your
favor instead of like and it's like
power it's words you know if you're
using words to talk bad about yourself
to be negative it's really just going to
drain you and at the same time if you
have people around you that are being
being negative like it's going to be
very hard to uh step up to the next
level because unfortunately a lot of
those people are trying to drag you down
with them and make you feel the way that
they feel
so
it's I don't know if tough is the right
word it's extreme because you know like
many people say the road to the top is a
lonely one and you know I think that
it's
that's true because especially in this
time people like to use crutches or
medications or something that's going to
fix them instead of working on fixing
themselves so if you're really dedicated
to this life life of growth because you
know when when we say you know going the
ladder for me the ladder has nothing to
do with how much money you have the
ladder is of personal
growth uh and you know you can highlight
a place like Bali you go to Bali there's
tons of people who are happy and smiling
and you would look at them in another
context and say that you know that they
are poor and have nothing but then I
would ask you you know who has nothing
the person who's happy with nothing or
the person who's miserable with
everything and you know not too many
people really reflect on the important
things of of life and of like what makes
you happy in life you know so many
people take that happiness out of the
equation and they'll in use those
external things like oh I'll be happy
when I have a certain amount of money
when I own a certain house when I have a
certain car but that's just like
something set to fail like you're
guaranteed to fail because everything
you're doing now is contributing to
unhappiness it's driving people away
from you it's not having real substance
in your life and it's like one of these
people that I really like he
says um if you're content with food
shelter and
companionship you tread lightly on this
world and quick quickly get to a place
that you want to give something in
return and I think for you know people
and that's like another part of you know
people see me they see you know that
I've eaten at expensive restaurant
stayed at five star hotels like lived on
private or like not lived but flown on
like private jet lived like a
extravagant lifestyle but at the same
time you know I I can be very happy with
the happiest that I am is when I'm just
with people that like laughing I don't
know and it's it's it's like that truth
of the food shelter companionship and
you look at a person like people in Bali
those are the important things to them
food shelter and companionship you know
maybe their shelter is not the way not
what you want but they have people to
share it with like and love all around
them and it's like in this fast-paced
Western life everyone's looking for a
quick fix and thinking that they can
almost Buy
anything where you know the it's like
what is like the the best things in life
for free which really couldn't be more
true know the material things that you
have they mean nothing to you if you
don't have anyone to share them with you
see the most unhappy people with the
most things and that tell you know what
have what have those people been focused
on they've been focused on attaining
things to bring happiness and it it's
almost a guaranteed failure you know
bring happiness to bring happiness you
know what can you do to smile in the
morning you know what can who are the
people that inspire you to be better who
are the people that you feel great when
you're around them like um and we spend
so little time thinking of these most
important things that really exist in
our existence and we're just all pulled
towards it's like the consumerism life
we're all pulled towards these shiny
things that have no substance
yeah and it's like we lose track of the
bigger game and the bigger game is
always to be happy it's always some form
of living in the moment experiencing joy
and we get sold on the illusion or the
fantasy that we need to do stuff to get
to a point and then we'll enjoy the
happiness after it's almost like the I
need to earn my happiness I need to
battle get my kind of armor my stripes
My Success my accolades and then I'll be
happy because I've earned my happiness
not thinking that happiness needs to be
the starting point now I'm really
curious to know um when this shift
happened for you cuz I'm imagining
someone very ambitious working really
hard almost obsessed with poker trying
to climb the the mountain to be the
number one earn the history of Poker and
it seems like at some point I'm not sure
when it was on this journey you had an
infraction point or a new way of
thinking about life in maybe more
holistic way where the bigger picture
start become more and more important so
can you picture when that time was for
you and what changed when you started to
think about maybe your overall happiness
your overall lifestyle rather than just
having success in Pok
okay so it was um it was the summer of
20 18 so in 2007 so uh we touched before
on like that diffic the that difficult
time I went through in 2016 we didn't
really touch that uh in 2017 after that
tournament that I was in in um in Manila
for triton I had the biggest winning
year of anyone in the world in 2017 I I
cashed for like 8.5 million and really
didn't play many tournaments I had my
biggest cash then I won 100K in Monaco
for three million or something there and
just really did well that whole year uh
so but that mostly just got me out of
the hole that I was in so then um
towards the middle of
2018 I just got like even with the
person who that was the business deal
with and as soon as I could I said you
know I'm done with you I want nothing to
do with you ever again I got away from
that person shifted into getting a a new
a staking deal with someone else uh
someone who actually had no interest in
staking but they were playing a lot at
the time and said that they thought that
I was the best in the world so there was
no way that they couldn't stake me in
their mind um then in
2018 I was having a losing
year um and it comes to the summer time
the summertime of
2018 and uh I met my now girlfriend then
and we so I actually plan I was in Vegas
at that time but I planned that I was
going to leave Vegas and go do something
else but we just connected and we were
hanging out every day
eating lots of
mushrooms
and you know that's when I started to
shift but at the same time I was
very sure about what I was sure about
because through my experience like uh
what worked for me like was like in my
perspective worked so far so to get me
to even pull out of that I would say
that she is uh very
patient uh to and I don't think that
there are many people that could have
actually uh like in I don't think that
there are many people in the world that
have like this skill set and composure
that could actually help me navigate um
where I was to where I am right now and
started little by little um making me
more aware of breathing and what I was
eating and getting some exercise like
throughout my day and you know hey this
is the way that people see you because
you said things like this is this how
you want to actually be it's like oh man
like whole like so and then it's like
the whole other thing so this experience
not that it was like ego white but at
the same time when you reach like this
high point of yourself and you're so
sure of these things it's really it's
hard as as especially the first time
it's hard to just you know wipe that
away and say okay well we're let's take
the these this still exists but let's
you know what exists here let's put the
pieces down and try to recreate it like
back to the person that I want to be
it's a whole like um I would say that
was like the beginning
of like that hero's journey and dropping
of like the ego that I created that I
believe was probably necessary for me as
a poker player but not necessary for me
as a person whereas like in my poker
experience if I didn't have that comete
confidence playing at the highest level
pretty much myself against all these
other groups I don't think that I could
have reached the top but then at the
same time as you then trans ition to a
different phase or person of yourself
you know maybe what was serving you
before isn't necessarily serving you in
the way that you want
to be or be seen like by others so I
think that and it's interesting too that
you said uh hero's journey one of my
good friends um that's actually that's
how she described my last year said you
know you have all this power you know
you were on this track that was very
intense you know it could have went and
I think when she met me she so this per
she she's a very uh gifted person she
said that when she met me she was
actually uh scared because she saw the
amount of like power and intensity that
I had and saw that it could go in either
direction let's say me as a tyrant or me
as like a Healer the one that I really
want to be and like relate to it's like
someone who helps others so it's like
this ego and this idea of myself had to
really be wiped through the floor and
that's like uh it's like that
[Music]
synchronoscope okay well so you know
whatever all this you know
intensity that you know you might not
ask for that's what's in your your cards
your stars like for whatever reason so
it's like you know do you want to accept
that or do you want to fight it and if
you fight it you know you can't change
grow with the times and you'll be stuck
as you as the way that you were so it's
like um I see myself like always um even
even uh the
the tough thing I guess is when you're
on like that thing of growth you'll
listen to a like a conversation a
podcast that you had a few months ago
and you're like who is that person you
know why did why did they say this like
what are you talk you're like
embarrassed for yourself it's like a lot
of times I actually don't like watch
them I think this is a very good one I
think this might be the first time or
one of the first times that I could look
at it maybe in six months and say okay
you know you were you're speaking well
you know clear you you said what you
wanted to say and I think that's all
like the growth of it too it's all like
it's all humbling experience you know
and then it's also difficult because
since a lot of people or I mean I don't
think that there are many people in the
world that are in like this intense
growth cooker that I've kind of been in
so they don't really they couldn't
understand this experience because it's
like uh it's not for them or it's like
it's not the like the path that they've
been on like for life so you kind of
have to accept that you know what you
have is unique to you and all that you
can do is keep trusting like your
instinct that's been working for you so
far and know keep like giving the best
that you possibly can and even though
these things are tough to navigate
through they were there for you and
they're there for you for a reason
and try to take with a smile I couldn't
say that I'm you
know to you know I'll be I'll be
completely honest because that's what I
like I don't I don't want to give
anything else and say that you know even
when you make it to like a high place of
yourself you know your yourself is still
just going to be destroyed in this like
place of growth so it's like I feel like
these last two years have been or like I
would say two and a half years for me
have been like the toughest most intense
like uh time of of my life but then you
could actually look at it in another way
where if you then say okay well all of
the huge transformation that I've had
was in these most difficult times of my
life I must be on the right track if I'm
now in the most intense time of my
life yeah so much to dive into there
it's almost like life's leading to
growth and all the challenges you go
through leads you to grow you mentioned
also almost like the death of the ego
and like being reborn in different parts
of yourself and I think it's when you're
on the growth path and like a fast
growth path as you mentioned you can
look back on yourself months ago like
half a year ago and be like who is this
who is this guy what was he doing and
that's a good sign that's a good sign
your moving forward and I think people
struggle with that because they create
such a fixed identity such a a strong
narrative they'll say something two
years ago and they'll want to stay
consistent with that over and over and
the people around them often expect them
to stay consistent as well whichs their
grow that's a that's a per that's a
perfect point right there and that's
like the even more difficult thing about
it because like as a lot of people exist
like in a a confined box they see you as
you were not as you are so even though
you're going through this like intense
growth people are going to see you as
your old self and almost life is going
to try to drag you back to your old self
it's just like that belief that you're
on like the right track of whatever
noise that you listen to like in the sky
or whatever know it tells you the way
that you are because it's like that if
you don't have that insane confidence in
yourself I think in the world that we
live
in you're going to be dragged down at
some point when you're when you climb
like on that mountain so it's like you
have to Harbor it's why life wouldn't
give it to you unless if you uh have
like learned and harbored these skills
that you need for that Journey it's like
you know life wouldn't be so cruel to
put you on a mountain that you couldn't
actually
climb you might not like how you're
going to climb there but if life gives
you it that means that you can handle it
yeah I love that so I want to just
quickly piece together that kind of
period of your PO career and your kind
of growth so you mentioned that kind of
Summer 2018 was very pivotal and you
started to look up your lifestyle more
Brea in diet everything around your
overall how you felt about yourself and
then I think 2019 was I think still one
of the best years if not the best year
ever in terms of profits and poker no
one will ever be no one will ever beat
that year I think it's almost impossible
because it has like the 20 mil cash
that'll probably never happen again and
then even if that happens again someone
would have to win that tournament and
cash for over 10 million apart from that
tournament in the year it's like you
know they they say that no records are
unbroken but unless if they start with
bigger buyin than a million-dollar Buy
in regularly this is going to be an
impossible one really for anyone to beat
but yeah since we since it like jumped
ahead I'll give a bit of that story then
too because okay so I have a amazing
time like that summer like uh I'd say my
mind like opens a lot more but
throughout the rest of that year I
couldn't really I couldn't win it was I
I'm pretty sure it was the only losing
year that I ever had in my career so now
I have this new stake deal with someone
and I was in well the buyin were so big
so I was in three and a half million in
makeup but I was playing 250k buyin like
100k Reby tournaments so it's not really
out of the norm to get in like that much
makeup so at the end of that year
actually um the person who was aking me
says like hey you know I think the
number is too big I'm willing to just
like wipe it clean and start from zero
again but in like that Integrity that I
have myself one thing that I always said
and that's how like life's interesting
how it tests you so one thing that I
always said that was that I would never
intentionally make a bad deal for anyone
so as soon as he's saying these words to
me that's what's ringing in my head like
wait wait if if you like accept this
thing that means that this deal was
horrible because if adversity happens
you accept like that it's too big for
you and you know it's was also someone
who had a ton of money so you know you
could easily be sitting in my shoes like
oh you know this three and a half
million means nothing to this person
like and it means a whole lot to me I'm
like no no no what matters to me is the
deals that I make and the word that like
I give and when we made a deal for a
high stakes like stake there was nothing
in there that if it hits negative 3.5
you're going to like just call it even
so I said to them I said don't worry I'm
going to be number one in the world
again next
year and then just somehow that's
exactly what
happened wow yeah and that's amazing and
as you mentioned a few times Integrity
being one of your core values and core
character traits that allows you to make
these decisions and I'm curious to know
like during this point so you 3.5
million in makeup and you're still
playing these really super high role as
did you have a kind of limit in your own
minds like how deep you could go before
it affected you mentally do you feel
calm through this process and yeah tell
me for like how you were managing that I
I would say I was really calm just
because I was I was having fun in life
still I was having like some type of
balance and even in
2019 it's not like I was hammering every
tournament I was playing tournaments
that I wanted to play so it's like start
of the Year Aussie Millions I loved
going there so it was just like I was
having fun I remember you know I was a
long like I don't know if you guys have
ever been like uh there at the casino
but there's a nice like um like River
and walkway I was just hanging out and
walking that every day eating healthy I
was smiling I was in the most negative
that I've ever been in my life but I was
happy and it actually you know because
um person who was taking me since I was
in like that spot they would loan me
like some life money too so I wasn't in
I was in a spot still that I could still
do the same things that made me happy
and didn't need you know money to
validate like who I was so I was able to
to you know
win lots keep none of the money but be
very positive for it and like the
direction that I was going in and I
really didn't I really had no doubts
like that year I guess I was so sure
that I was going to be number one in the
world again like somehow even though I
just I'm at the end of my first losing
year ever I'm in the most negative that
I've ever been in I've got I owed
another I think half a mill on the side
which means since like staked at 50/50
you need a million to cover that so I
needed to win like 4 and a half million
just before actually no I owed million
on the side at that point half and then
another half I was at a point where I
needed to win five and a half million
just to get even so that's like another
um well actually so we fast forward so
when I was in that London thing the
thing that when I was in like that last
experience in 2016 in London to get out
of that room like staying confident the
thing that I accepted is that it might
take me three years just to get my head
above water but the thing is whatever
you just start climbing and do like what
you can and somehow as reality has it
you know I wound up in negative again
but nine months later I was at from this
point that seemed like it would have
been a good three years to get out and I
got out in nine months and then was able
to you know some pull myself out of it
again and I think that balance and
laughter and value for things other than
at the poker table allowed me to have
fun and enough calmness and creativity
to have like that massive year in
2019 I hope you guys are enjoying the

now and let me and Adam help you achieve
your poker goals in
2024 yeah I think this will be a great
time to uh go deeper into how you think
about risk so there's almost like two
sides of this one some some people be
listening going wow BR is so reckless he
was willing to lose it all then he got
lucky spun it up and works out nice but
he could have easily went 10 mil on the
hall and his Backa and him himself was
in a bad situation but for you it feels
like obviously during this point you've
already built a tolerance for swinging
Millions so you're used to that get
those money that doesn't scare you which
feels normal you're playing super high
rollers so it's in Bion it's not crazy
amounts but I'm wondering how you think
about risk to reward I know as po
players we constantly even every pot
your in there's a risk to reward
calculation going on how do you think
about so for you we've got the dream of
being the number one player in the world
but the the negative side of that the
risk is I go 10 million 20 million into
a hole and I can never get out of it so
um how do you navigate risk and thinking
about the risk of Rewards or do you just
have so much confidence over the long
term that you're not really overly
concerned yeah I'm I'm curious to know
how you think about I think I think it's
that last one that I have so much
confidence in the long term but also
that I relate it to like that mountain
that's in the future that's always
present but not present let's say
because okay so if my goal is to is to
do good in the world you know let's in
in the early days of myself that was I'd
say the the mindset my goal is to build
something that I could do good in the
world with so for me it was like okay
you have a million dollars what are you
going to do with a million dollars you
can't do anything you might as well
gamble it and try to build up like
something bigger and I've actually seen
some poker players talk about it uh I
think it was pads who talked about how
you should take lots of risk like as
you're younger because the value of if
things go well is so exponentially
higher than taking risk like in later
stages when things are more like
developed so I think I just innately had
like that mindset that because I had
this skill in poker and for me it was
always that I I would I could always win
it back I've always won it back I
consistently W in poker even when I got
into these holes it wasn't from me
playing poker it was from me staking
people me doing a bad business deal me
spending too much money in life like the
norm was that I consistently won so
having that like Supreme confidence that
even no matter where I find myself in I
can pull myself out of it and then at
the same time you know because you have
these goals that need much more
resources than the ones that you have it
makes sense to gamble heavily with the
ones that you have to try to to reach
the ones that you
need I think it's I think it's even like
a to be hon I think it's really a
selflessness too and it comes almost to
the detriment sometimes I think of of
like my girlfriend
unfortunately
because it's like having the it's G to
be from anyone who hasn't had this
experience it's a super intense one and
it really you're willing to risk
everything like for this greater belief
where most people are so risk tolerant
that they're not really they're they
couldn't imagine like risking
everything so it's like then it comes
that's all even like the the higher
levels I think that you reach in life
the more intricacies that come with them
and the more that life uh almost Demands
a higher level of yourself at all times
to be able to navigate through like
those rough
Seas so you said you're willing to risk
everything for the belief that you have
in that future that that mountain that's
in the background and you mentioned also
pad saying that when you're young taking
a lot of risk is exponentially worth it
because the compounding effects when
risks pay off is there a point where
when you're navigating life you want to
almost recalibrate a bit of your risk
tolerance so if we look at you right now
if you're always willing to put it on
the line is like the not like an
inevitable 30 million down that knocks
you from your next points or do you feel
like you don't really think about you
don't really care about ever losing
everything because you can make it back
so do you feel like for yourself for
your own growth has there been a
recalibration of how you take on risk
are you still willing to risk it all for
the dream if the dream's strong I think
that's that's like the yeah that's like
the part that life asked me I think in
this last bit are you still willing to
risk everything for what you believe and
I would have to say that I stood up and
said yeah bring it give me
it so uh yeah
somehow I would say because it's just
like
um okay so it's it's very different
though so I would say for anyone
listening you have to uh you can't think
of things the same way that I think of
things because I have a special like
talent and special gift I think if they
ran like a competition in the world of
people starting with $1,000 or $10,000
or
$100,000 and who over like the long run
comes out like with the most bankroll at
the end of the year I think I'd be in
the top
0.00001% of the world so I have this
skill that I can
turn very little and spin it into
something big with like there's always
poker games everywhere I've I clearly
have like the poker skill to win I've
I've won in every version of Poker I've
won in heads up and PLO in eight game
and tournaments sit and goes cash games
every single version of Po live poker
online poker I've you know I've never uh
I've never really got lessons from
anyone in any game when I started
playing PLO I just you know hopped in
and played the first downs of PLO myself
never even watched any training videos
I've just whatever skills that I have I
think that they're perfectly suited for
poker so since I have like this ability
that's very rare I would say to spin up
nothing into something I can take these
risks that I do whereas at the same time
if I was giving advice to someone else I
would definitely tell them that they
should not take like risks to the same
extreme level as me because the value
that you always have is the resources
that you have and for most people in the
world it takes a lot of time to to grow
and scale these resources and if you
lose them it's very hard to come back
from nothing uh poker like a rare
industry that you could do it that
Stakes exist that people will are
willing to stake you you there are many
things in the world that you can like go
to zero and build something back up
again so it's like uh use Extreme
Caution with this and you know please
don't try this at home you know it's not
it's it's I'm sure that it's not for you
you know maybe there's a person that's
listening that that this is for them and
they say you know exactly the way that I
feel is the way that they relate to life
and they want to give everything that
they can to be a better person to help
as many people as they possibly can then
I would say you know put it all on the
line you know but that's also not a you
know a comfortable ride you know except
that that's a crazy one except that
life's going to give you it it's like
that um that saying be care be careful
what what you wish for because that's
what that's how I see it too you know
know be careful what you wish for
because that's what's coming and it's
like are you sure that you even want
what you wish for and that's that's
where a lot of people kind of miss the
boat because they think that they want
something but they actually haven't done
the thinking of what that means for
their life because like everything has
positive and negative it's the Yan and
the Yang of something so you could say
Okay I want this thing because what I
gained from this is so big but did you
think about what you lose from it you
know maybe it's time maybe it's relation
ships like there's so much into like
that picture and that's why it's like
unless if you're if you're trying to do
something unless if you like
self-analyze and are always willing to
like go back to the drawing
board life's like going to eat you
alive yeah very interesting and as you
mentioned the tolerance for risk is very
unique to you and maybe some people
relate to that I think what is a Common
Thread throughout this conversation is
going after to the dream and climbing
the mountain your own mountain now you
set the mountain super high you were
like Mount Everest top peak other people
have the smaller mountains that are
trying to climb but we're all our own
Journey trying to level up ourselves to
get to our destination now what I
thought was really interesting is how
you spoke about kind of what's going to
make you happy on on that Journey where
you're trying to get to and most people
kind of don't know and I've been I've
had hundreds of conversations with poker
players and it's been quite surprising
for me as I've gone into coaching to
realize how many people don't know where
they want to be in life they haven't
chosen their path and they hav Clarity
they say they want more money they say
they want an ex Financial want more
freedom if you give them Freedom they
wouldn't know what to do with it and
they haven't mapped out this vision of
where they want to go what what life's
about and I always feel like Life's a
game where we can be anyone we want
character-wise we can achieve almost
anything we want and we' just got to
choose we've got to choose and stay the
course and this is very interesting how
many people don't choose for you I'm
much it was a conscious process it
sounds like you have drives internally
things come to you ideas thoughts and it
feels strong and you go with that and
that's just the path to go other people
have to sit down and actually map out
like kind of think through their
thoughts Journal going Retreats do
things to actually get some clarity but
the main thing is like going with that
kind of vision and having it strong
enough that it drives everything else
that's going around you even when things
are pulling on you whether it's people
whether it's situations you've got that
strong path now I want to stick a
backgrounds before I forget to um what
allows you to be successful in every
game of Pok you play every format just
jump in so I'm trying to think what's
the common Trend or the common themes or
traits that allow you to be a big winner
you mentioned you got skills that are
just nail tail made for poker so I'm
curious to know what allows you with
confidence to jump into a new game a new
format online live high roller whatever
and be a winner what what allows that to
happen um I guess it was always like fun
for me is the thing so like magic almost
shaped the way into thinking about poker
like a competition and the chips being
play chips and you're just trying to
like accumulate chips however you can so
you know you're okay then losing chips
you're okay learning I think the thing
that enables me I believe to be super
successful at it is the willingness to
be completely open-minded and not write
off anything so you know of course like
when you jump into a game for the first
time and you said a bit of this you know
what will you do you're going to look at
the other people who are winning in this
game and you're going to try to
incorporate some of the moves and
thinking that they do inside your own
game so without even realizing it you
know you might be playing a certain game
like you know you start out playing
mixed let's say and five years later
you're still playing mixed you don't uh
consciously realize it but part of your
game is from so many different people
and things that they did so you know one
move that you make you don't realize
that you know maybe you saw John henigan
do it five years ago and you were like
oh this MO move is like sick and I'm
going to bring this into my game and 5
years later you know you wind up in a
similar spot like like that and I think
it's kind of similar with life too where
what is it another one of the things in
life is you become like um like a mix of
the five people that you're closest to
so I see it all like I see us as energy
so like the me that's here right now I
feel like is all of these different
pieces of different people that have
like touch my life in different ways of
like their way of thinking their way of
being the way that something that maybe
they taught me something that they
allowed me to realize in myself so it's
like some of the words that I say even
aren't my words they're like they're
someone else's words that resonate with
me so it's like um I think that the
thing that I'm very good at
is
um being confident but being open minded
which okay so the way that I see it is
personally I believe that if you're not
open-minded that you're not in my terms
of intelligent you know you might be
intelligent on like paper you might be
able to whiz like a test or something
but if you're unwilling to change like
the way that you're thinking and the way
that you're being you know it's in that
like you know you're going to get swept
away with the times so since I was
always confident but also so willing to
re-evaluate my thought process and my
way of playing it allowed like this
massive creativity that maybe didn't
exist for others because they lived in a
certain parameter that you know this
play is either right or wrong like it's
all on paper the other variables like
don't exist but for me it's like all of
these other V for personally all these
other variables do exist everything's
always interchanging it's all based on
completely different scenarios that you
might even see two scenarios that I see
completely different as you know oh
those two look like very similar but I
would have a reasoning for why I see
them as completely different scenarios
and I think like that open-mindedness
has really been the thing that's like
propelled me to the top of any game and
willingness to like learn from others so
even if you know I'm playing let's say
for instance I'm you're playing with
people in high rollers you know some of
the things you don't agree with but the
thing is they're also very good very
smart people so if you then say like
okay you know I'm just the best and I'm
the best you have no chance like of
actually being the best or staying the
best maybe you were at the top of the
mountain for a small bit but unless if
you're taking parts of the things that
other people are learned and things that
work for them so you know I think a lot
of times okay so there are some people
in poker that have won for 15 years or
something that a lot of other winning
players would say you know this guy is
bad I would look at it completely
different it's like what do you mean
this guy is bad he's been winning
consistently must be doing multiple
things right yeah you might be looking
at things in a vacuum and saying this is
bad maybe it even is bad in his game
because everyone has leaks and I think
that I'm good at figuring out where
their weaknesses lie and how to exploit
those but at the same time you need to
look at other successful people see what
they're doing and put it into your own
thinking so you know some you know you
might the this person maybe you look at
20 different things that they're
thinking that they do and maybe you
think 19 of them are right are wrong but
maybe there's a genius in one of them
and if you
discredit that person's skill or ability
then you also discredit that one genius
that you can accumulate to your own game
so that open-mindedness if you don't
have will be your
demise and then it's like also you know
if someone is closed-minded they play a
fix certain game my game is okay I'm
going to I'm going to think about how
you play and I'm going to build a
strategy that's good against your
strategy and then you know I thought
about poker so much I got I think in in
the times where I was playing my best
the way that I would think about it is
okay what's the best strategy against my
own strategy because you know you you
have to like be in that forward thinking
you have to think ahead of okay how can
someone combat this and is there a way
that if they figure this out that
they're going to be able to exploit you
in all these different ways and I think
one of the first eure moments I had was
like okay the best strategy against my
strategy is to keep pot small and stay
away and the people who don't do that
wind up in the blender and you know
you're going to wind up in tough spots
over and over again and you know if you
keep going after you know the other
toughest people in the jungle you're
going to get cut and bit sometimes but
if you know you can navigate through you
know see you know I respect this guy
over here you know sometimes you're
going to wind up in a pot with him but
you're also not going to go out of your
way to try to be in a pot with a person
who's like on this level and you know
it's that's like the ego that I feel
like gets a lot of people to and
probably
because so like you know what what that
said to me on that time of like not
competing uh what the what I got from
that is that there are probably a lot of
people that I competed against that felt
like that they were competing against me
and that was like an extra layer that
made them unable to compete against me
because it's almost like I'm clear in
that space they're like congested
because they're thinking okay they have
to get past me I'm just like no no I
just have to like make the right
decision get past myself so it's like
then you know you you're navigating the
river becomes all that
harder yeah I think going into this
conversation some myself included might
wonder like how you got to the top the
very top of the game without studying
like you know generic study and so to
speak but listen you speak get so clear
how you learn and how you grow as a
person and you mentioned like being
openminded and so I'm picturing you
going into a new format and learning
from imitation you mentioned as well
like kind of mimicking people if you
look at our childhood like before six
years old we literally pick up language
we pick up skills we pick up motor
skills we pick up how to walk talk just
by watching we literally no one gives us
a book to read we just watch people we
learn stuff so we learn from imitation
and you mention like absorbing
information and you talk about like
energy getting absorbed so imagining you
being like an open vacuum absorbing all
the information around you mimicking
things that are good that you think that
could be working but also radically
open-minded to what could be explored
where other people might fix themselves
off strategy wise you this creative
bundle of energy you're absorbing all
the good points then you almost got your
own ingredients to mix around and you
allow yourself to be creative you
mentioned at the start of the
conversation actually which I I wrote
down our creativity gets stolen from us
Often by Society by people and if feel
it for you you've never allowed your
creativity to be stolen you've always
allowed yourself to come with your own
strateg come up with what works for you
so yeah really really intriguing and
yeah I think that's it shows how your
mind works but also how you're able to
be a good winner in every game because
it like success leaves Clues and you
you've been a long winner for a long
time um in all games you've played for S
such a sample size that it's impossible
to say it's being anything other than a
skill so I think for you for the
audience listening understanding that
yeah this open-mindedness I think that's
the thing as well where it's easy to
talk about being open-minded but we
often have fixed views on something for
example I like being right I like my
view being this is I'm good at this if
I've got to open my mind up I've got to
go I could be wrong that what I just did
there could be awful what this guy did
there which I class is bad could have
actually Max exploited me and I could be
the idiot not him oh that feels
uncomfortable I don't like sitting with
that maybe I Lael him an idiot and I'm
the genius ah I'm the jior C the perfect
all right back to my cave and life goes
on so I think we can talk about that but
it's harder to do in practice um so yeah
hopefully anyone listening has been
refreshing to hear what it's like to be
openminded and to uh yeah try on
different viewpoints and perspectives as
well all right I want to bring in Ren
now because I r waiting patiently it's
not me waiting patiently on the
sidelines uh but we went deep into mind
how you think about poker how you think
about life your holistic philosophies
and I know Ren is very keen to go into
your how you think about strategy and
how you've improved your technical game
so I'll pass it over to you Ren yeah I
mean you already actually touched on a
topic that I actually was very curious
in diving into because he also mentioned
it like you w in every format of Poker
and this is also something that Adam
already touched on I was curious like
from a technical perspective what are
like some Concepts that all poker games
SL formats have in common that you need
to understand in order to be successful
in all these games like there's some
underlying mechanics in all games of
Poker that you know that translate well
into all the games could you maybe think
of a couple yeah well like first so the
f I got one amazing piece of advice or
especially for like the way that I like
to play poker when I was 20 years old I
met this guy who was a big winner at the
time playing 25 50 on like stars like
maybe in the same days as you maybe a
bit before he was monkey 101 on stars
like back in like maybe
2006 he was like the number one winner
on there yeah I think that sounds like
2007 and um I was hanging out with him
on one trip in at Commerce Casino I was
20 or 21 years old and um he kind of
opened my mind of saying that his whole
approach is based on like what the other
person has so it's like my mind exploded
like at the time I was playing this game
that was you know focused on what I had
what do you you know I'm like oh okay
you know it's like it all just like got
wiped out right there it's like okay so
this game is actually focused on what
your opponent has how to exploit them
the most and how to navigate like
through this sea the most so and then I
think it's it's a lot of taking some
type of mechanics that you learn from a
different type of game so like for
example when I jumped into heads up PLO
i' played heads up no limit before so I
some of like the mechanics of heads up
poker are similar even though the game
is completely different the way you
think about it and the way that you
approach it so now it's like you take
those pieces that you have that apply to
this while at the same time being
willing to like open your mindset and
thinking of how heads up in this game is
different than the other game so it's
like taking the L the skills that you
have translating some of them and also
just ex being okay with being a beginner
at something and just be with being
willing to pay the price that it costs
to go from beginner to the next phase
which I would say then just went to bus
like you know even though it's not on
the topic it's like then the same thing
you know in any type of mountain it's
like you know can you can you go from
like
um ex or EXP maybe not expert but
someone with an high Advance something
to then you know going to like a next
thing accepting that you're a beginner
and then paying the price to become
something bigger so it's like when I
went into business I was a beginner you
have to pay the price to graduate from
beginner to anything else would many
people have jumped into business the way
that I did almost certainly not
but I was H since my whole like exper my
whole thing is experience and I learn
through experience I'm not going to
learn it through a book I'm going to
learn it like in experience and how it
works for me so it's like I have to pay
the price to be the fish in the
beginning to then be able to level up to
the point where you know you go from the
fish to holding your own to now maybe
mastering like what field that you're in
and being okay with being the fish I
think is a necessary trait in those
because if you think that you're going
to go into any of these games and be
like okay you know I'm great at Omaha so
of course I'm going to be great at you
know mix games for some reason what do
you like the two don't go in two
together at all but there are some
things in poker that you know Concepts
that you use and ways that you think
about it's kind of like the same way
where uh you'll see people who have no
idea how to play mixed hop into like the
50k in the summer and make runs or even
win the tournament just knowing
tournament strategy
and when to push like the gas and when
to hold off like which is interesting
too as well you know someone um like M
rocki I think is a perfect example who
won the PLAYERS Championship multiple
times I think if you asked other high
stakes mix game players how his mix game
is in a vacuum they would probably say
that he shouldn't be playing at the
highest level with others but then at
the same time because he has other
skills that translate to success in that
format even without understanding that
maybe some of even basic R basic like
understandings that these other experts
are so deep into he's able to with his
skills like navigate that and then
others you know will probably will will
look at it and say you know oh you know
he's lucky know sure maybe like luck
exists sometimes but when it when it's
consistently happening and like regular
basis you know I think he won the
PLAYERS Championship twice I think he
final taed it another two times in the
past like 20 years and this is a
five-day tournament that's so like deep
and long and you play so many hands of
so many different games so if you look
at things like buy a textbook you say no
it doesn't make sense which is then why
you have
to not Jud it's like don't judge the
book by its cover before you know what's
inside
and actually that's uh that's very
interesting what you touched on like you
could let's say you play a tournament
and it doesn't really matter if it's BL
mixed game no limit hold them but indeed
like reading the situation like oh this
guy is under quite a lot of pressure I
should apply some pressure here or all
my stack at this moment is quite
valuable maybe I should s it out these
like overline principles that whatever
game you play they will apply in this
tournament format so if you're a good
tournament player you could probably
play p no limit hold them mix game a lot
of things will transition I guess it's
more difficult then when you play or I
guess if you're play a cash game player
if you're a cash game player and you're
used to playing deep stack lot of the
deep stack Concepts will translate if I
play PLO or no limit hold them if we're
deep we're deep some some Concepts will
apply and if we're short we're short
some Concepts will still apply yeah for
sure but this aha moment actually that
you felt said was I think was very
interesting where you said like oh it's
not about my own cards I have actually a
very similar aha moment twice I think I
remember there was this girl called from
Norway and 15 or something if I recall
correctly that she won a tournament
without looking at her cards that was
like the story right it was like what do
you mean won a tourn but you need your
cards right I was like huh so then I
remember I was playing like some some
multiable sit and goes on food tilt back
then and I also started to understand
like oh these shcks are stored they
cannot bust basically I understood ICM I
didn't know what ICM was but I was like
wait but they're short I can put
pressure on them and then I remember
it's like oh I would put my hand like
above my cards and then next next time
if this spot comes I will just Jam any
two and I would literally put my hands
on my car I can apply pressure to you
guys you know I had no clue what I was I
had no clue about ICM but I understood
ICM in a certain way I was like I can
put a lot of pressure here and thought I
would just be jabbing like Jack three
offs from the hijack because just you
know I was just Levering pressure I
didn't care about the cards you know
yeah exactly that's actually when you
start to realize that like oh wow it's
not about my own cards I remember it was
a very big breakthrough for me as well
yeah
um you did actually end up deciding on
mtts for I guess your most professional
career I don't know how much other games
but that's I think what you're most
known for and that's also what you're
number one in what is it then about mtts
that makes that makes no limit MTS that
makes it well actually it was just like
when I lost that like um when I spun up
the 50k to 3.5 million it was all in
cash games I'd never played an MTT
before then then when I like lost it all
I got to the point where I think when I
started when I lost it all at first I
might have been playing still like some
1020 2550 when let's say I was at like
500k roll to like
negative roll or so and I kept trying to
play cash a bit the pro I realized
though that because I was playing such
high stakes and such a high level that I
couldn't
really bring my presence into these cash
games at a low level and I was I was
almost like pushed in the the direction
of okay well the thing that you you know
you're negative 500 in the hole you're
not playing well at 510 what can you do
to get yourself out of
it and you know mtts just kind of like
popped
up and that and that that started well
you were like okay but Strate from like
a strategical perspective do they intrig
you more than for example C games I
enjoyed it so much more than I started
to see like mtts like um like fun and
cash games like a job like cash games
for me seemed like clocking in at work
had a lot of similar like aspects where
like in mtts there were so many
different scenarios that kind of kept
things fun for me always so it's like I
I just had fun in them and kind of
really just didn't look back actually I
can relate to that like I don't play
much tournaments I may play cash games
but I do say that if I hop on a
tournament especially live uh you sit
down and I'm just there to solve the puz
bow I get like all these new situ
situations and scenarios that I don't
really I'm not used to and I like it
really triggers the creativity and
brings really back the fun I can
definitely relate to that I'm curious
like we talked a bit about uh solvers
decisions like obviously for a solver to
come up with the correct correct correct
decision quote quote it needs like
certain information right it needs to
take things to consider relized who's
the in position player out of position
player what's the spr of course what are
the ranges because the ranges will make
up the equities which is you know pretty
important in poker any game you play I
believe yourself you're not so much into
solvers if I understood that correctly
but you obviously make great decisions
what information do you find is most
important to look for and to process in
order to make the correct decisions I'm
kind of I kind of want to know what kind
of what variables do go in the mind of
the bring Kenny solver you know that
that you need to take in consideration
in order to make a good decision okay so
I would say like uh it's starts with
like uh in like the high rollers where
I've had like the most success it starts
with like how's the person feeling that
day at what stage of the tournament are
we in uh then it comes down to like when
you're inside of a hand you know you
wind up in like a big river spot and you
then have to Recon so now like in this
big river spot the person's representing
a certain hand then you start to
construct the hand from pre flop to
River and say you know it does the story
check out of this person the way that
they usually play or the way that you
know do they actually have this hand and
it's I guess it's looking it's
continuously looking
for things that don't make sense that
like kind of ring out so it's like you
know someone's trying to rep a hand on
the river and you you get to like the
Flop on it and it just doesn't make
sense to you that this hand that they're
now trying to rep on the river that they
actually had like on the Flop or pre
flop or on the Turner so so it's like
con deconstructing all the information
that you have and like putting the
puzzle back together and trying to solve
like I guess their way of thinking so
mine is all about trying to understand
the way that the other person thinks and
I feel like I'm better equipped to wind
up
in rare
situations than they are with the tools
that I have and I I guess I welcome
those new situations and I'm comfortable
in them yeah you're you're more
comfortable I would say from what I'm
hearing is like problem solving on the
Fly basically yeah I would I've said
exactly that before for sure I mean this
is this is very important and I've I've
heard this before and this is something
that's currently a bit more overlooked
because solvers really make you focus on
trying to play a good strategy from your
perspective but as you as you learned
from from this guy that you mentioned
he's only thinking about what his
opponent has and in order to know what
your hand can do we need to think about
what our opponent has and like current
modern day thinking is way more focused
on oh I should do this I should do that
and that's very solver driven where
you're clearly way more focused on okay
I'm trying to figure out what the hell
this guy has and if my hand can call
like sometimes people might fold the
hand to say oh this hand is low up in my
range I don't need to call this hand but
like yeah but that's maybe the wrong
questions you want to ask yourself can I
call this hand based on what I think my
opponent is up to and it's that way if
you think if you think can you might
sometimes fold your range or you might
sometimes sometimes call your range
which you know is probably a more uh
accurate way of going around things and
then I I think that I like think ahead
to whereas like okay the way I think in
some spots is let's say we wind up like
on a
flop uh and we don't have anything but
this is like a board that we that versus
our select opponent here we can very
safely bet like quarter pot quarter pot
shove for pot on the river and they're
just going to go call call fold so
whereas like someone else is thinking
okay like I'm bluffing so I want to bet
big here and get him off it on the Flop
I'm taking like the suicide like not
suicide but I'm taking the very high
risk approach of okay I'm sure that
actually because this guy's going to
fold on the river to my all-in shove I
actually want more and more chip so
actually even though I'm bluffing I'm
actually value betting the Flop and turn
because I know I'm stealing it on the
river yeah you're you're investing in
your bluff I like to call this inves in
your bluff you're like okay let let them
call let them call because I'm gonna
steal the PT later anyway exactly yeah
this is I think also it's understanding
how how much or your B sizing how that
influences your range and when kind of
your desired job is complete so you
might fire out a very big bat on the
earlier Street and expect him to already
fold most hands and then to Fire Keep On
firing is kind of useless because you've
already kind of pushed his range towards
hands that they're now only going to
call you so it's kind of understanding
when what what job you're trying to
accomplish and when the job is completed
sort of speak do you do you associate
with that yeah definitely and then like
because yeah there's so much creativity
that you can really do so like another
thing pops up to me so we're playing
like a 100K tournament in
Vegas um opponent in the is uh David
Einhorn you know super successful hedge
fun guy like plays poker for fun uh
plays on the on the tighter side I would
say so we wind up in this spot where
um the the we've got like 910 off suit
the Flop is like uh 1044 he check calls
the big
blind um the turn comes like a a
three um like he check raises the
turn we call because doesn't really make
sense as anything the river completes
the flush on the river with a queen so
he checks and in this spot like uh
almost everyone would check behind uh I
saw it as okay he tried some like
strange Bluff on the turn that he like
Checker something that like has nothing
he doesn't have a flush here you know
maybe he's got a random Queen but most
likely he doesn't so I just go for like
the 10 to 15% pot bet on the river only
to induce a raise knowing that we're
actually never getting called and
winning uh only inducing a raise he
wakes up with like a raise with his like
ace2 off or Ace five off or something
and uh he's he's just like he's standing
he stands up and he's just looking at
the board like in
disbelief and uh another guy like comes
up behind him and he tells him he says
you know good good bluff wrong
[Music]
customer I mean good bluff I mean you
would never you would never make
basically your bed there is only
designed to get raised so I don't know
how how how how great the bluff is but I
I completely agree with you here most
people are like well uh well I'll check
behind I win quite often he probably
doesn't he's going to call it anyway so
yeah hand hand is over there but they
little inj on the river I really like
this play man it's a good yeah like it's
like that creativity you know since
everything's possibility you just wind
up in that spot at that exact time and
the correct play is only how you can
extract the most
value you could say whatever for any the
best thing that you could do in every
moment is either extract the most value
or lose the minimum in like spots that
you just can't win the pot and you know
you know there can also be times where
you just got lucky to get into that
maybe it wasn't but if some you know for
me personally if I was someone
competing against myself and seeing you
know these type of crafty
plays I wouldn't equate any type of luck
with
it no especially like even even on how
can I say let's say even it's a short
even it's a small sample if you see a
hand like this it shows some sort of you
know without boosting your confidence a
bit too much it shows some sort of
Brilliance you know like you have to you
have to really think on a on a on other
level to come up with a play like that
it's it's not it's it's not within the
standardized Playbook well because yeah
it's like the thing of what is it you
master something in 10,000 hours and
when I like thought about it I've spent
about 100,000 hours like playing
poker you you probably read Mastery 10
times then according to this
rule we saw we saw a little piece of
Mastery right there with it's it's
normal that's what's like supposed to
happen really it's like you dedicate
like your life and your craft to
something and you I hope that you have
some Mastery in there not to say that
you're perfect because I'm far I'm very
far from perfect but willing
to rewrite the drawing board because
like place place that are bit more out
of the box they're usually also on a
thin line right between brilliant and
and like what the [ __ ] was that so you
also mentioned like bring presence I I
wrote down you bring presence how
important is then bringing presence to
if you play this type of Poker right
which I I I get you you're a bit more
intu if you follow your guts then if if
you're if you're if you're not present
and if your gut is
wrong you know you're balancing a quite
Thin Line there yeah and if you're not
feeling good that day and your whole
like thing is about like your instincts
and your instincts maybe are just off
that day because like you're not
thinking like in your most clear way so
then you just have to get back to the
drawing board and be like okay well I
can't let anything that's going on
outside of the table affect me at the
poker table and if it's going to I can't
play poker
then that makes sense so I I've also
heard you talk about the the the flow of
the game which variables do it exist in
like within the word the flow of the
game what are we talking about because
flow stage stage stage of the tournament
and like stack distribution of the table
so like you know when you're hitting
these points of getting close to the
money close to the final table there's
sometimes you know like you like you
were touching on you can raise with any
two cards without looking at your cards
but at the same time if you're trying to
do that same style and you've got strong
players on your left you know good luck
like you're going to wind up like in a
tough one so that's why like poker is
like a
bit it's good to be humbled in poker
because you know just because you're
playing tight in a certain like
situation that you're in doesn't mean
that you think that anyone's better than
you it just means that you think that
that's the right strategy to come so you
can think that you're the best in the
world and you can also wind up at a
table at a certain stage of a tournament
and your mind is like okay I'm just GNA
fold like everything and then not to let
it also affect like I no what do you
mean I'm bet I'm the best like I have to
you know do something and and make
something happen so you know really you
just have to like sit back take a breath
and it's going to come to you yeah this
is also kind of like it's a thin thin
line again between forcing spots and
trying to see spots that are not really
there or to really and again I I I agree
with you like presents because those
kind of spots you feel that are right
but sometimes you feel that you're kind
of trying you want them you want the
spot to be there but you actually deep
down inside you know it's not the one
right yeah but still then you still go
for it it's always like that thin line
really and that's why like you need the
confidence and that's I guess also why
you spend so much time nowadays more on
like being happy being present being in
the moment instead of forcing more hours
on poker study because it wouldn't
really translate into more win rate for
you yeah what what is something in your
opinion that like current modern day GTO
players uh fail to understand about the
game of
poker
they see it like inside of a vacuum that
the that the situation is like you know
just there as it's presented to you and
doesn't like change at all
and I mean I couldn't disagree more with
like the whole approach of GTO I don't I
don't know if it's like just because the
way that I think it doesn't relate to my
own way of being at all or that it's
really something that's robbing everyone
of their creativity I'm sure that there
are some people who are very robotic
thinkers
that their way of being is like kind of
memorizing and playing like this certain
style but personally I believe that it
takes the fun and creativity out of the
game which you'll never be able to be
your best without expressing some type
of creativity and having fun and I think
that that yeah that's why like poker is
amazing because it's like an a perfect
expression of your creativity but then
at the same time it's so funny too it's
like life you know like there are so
many ways to express your creativity in
life but all the things in life are
telling you that you should be like this
like this mold fit in this box you
should do things this way and the people
who there are you know tons of people
that go that way I'm just in the way of
thinking like you know actually infinite
possibilities exist you know have fun
while you're doing something you know be
able to to laugh at yourself
and yeah so actually I hate it to be
honest you know how the rhetoric
non-stop is about how like you know if
you don't play GTO and poker you can't
win like okay maybe this is also like
from the way people talked to you about
GTO and how you got into touch with GTO
because I would say that I've Sol a lot
of GTO but there's so much room to be
creative but it all comes down to you go
sit with the solver and if you go in
there and you say solver tell me what I
have to do yes it will rub you from all
your creativity but if you sit with the
same solver and start to play around
with it and ask it hey solver what can I
do in various situation if this changes
if this changes if that changes then
suddenly you will see oh wow if I play
around with these variables change this
then solver is one of the most creative
cre the market person yeah I wouldn't
call that that person like a solver
player I would say that they're using
the tools that are available to their to
enhance their game people forget that
the solver that the outputs that they're
looking at it's just a toy game it's
just a toy game for the situation with
the input that it's been given it has
nothing to do with reality yeah I think
what it is is too many people Bunch
together too many things that are
similar but not the same and then say
that they are the same and then see them
as that same way instead of the approach
that you can have with the solver so I
think that probably 99% of the people
are in that Bunch group Bunch things
together do less work than they could in
the approach that you're saying I think
the approach that you're saying is very
similar to my Approach in a different
way mine is just doing it while playing
Non-Stop and yours is doing it while
like tinkering with numbers non-stop I
think both of those can get to the same
place but for sure like if you're text
booking it and bunching them together I
think that it can yeah so instead of for
example what I would then recommend
let's say people would study how to play
button versus big blind then they would
study how to play hijack versus big
blind then they would study MP versus
big blind in my opinion you're wasting a
lot of time because if you would sure
focus on button versus big blind and
then just focus on hey I'm now in a
tight range formation what will change
out of that you get a concept oh in
tighter ranges I will play like this or
I don't know you were starting a spell
at 40bb what changes if I play BB out of
that you get certain Concepts that you
can apply to your game hey in general
stack size will impact my strategy in a
certain way but you don't have to learn
restudy the whole tree and actually the
robbing of the creativity we had
actually a guest on in the previous
podcast with Nikolai and he touched on a
block of Stefon you're probably not in
touch with the current online street but
Stefon 1112 is a very creative Russian
poker player considered one of the best
and he actually wrote in his blog that
it's he didn't like poker he saw it as a
job but but when he started to see poker
as an expression of himself and a place
where he could express his creativity
that's when it all changed and like and
you said exactly the same so I had to I
had to remember of the previous podcast
for the people check it out go to the
Nikolai podcast yeah I have to see it
yeah I love that thinking yeah he made
he made a block pass I put it I put it
in the description of the Nikolai
podcast I I will send it over to you uh
after after our podcast it's it's h yeah
really really good poker player what is
something that that you actually learned
from new school players because you have
played a lot with like the new new
school GTO players and I'm sure they've
put you in spots and you pay attention
to what other people players do that's a
part of how you learn what have you
learned from like the new school the new
school era I think the new phase was
like uh people squeezing like bigger
like in out of position spots where like
in the past there was a lot of like
clicking in small raises where it's like
really turned into like big raises in
like these similarish type of spots so
it's like um it's hard to say that
definitively because like through out
like all those phases you know you see
something that like chidwick is doing
and you like it and you incorporate it
into like your game and you try to like
pick those like pieces from everyone so
since it's like a an always Chang my
Approach is like always
changing thought process it's always
taking what others believe to be what
other smart people believe to be right
or a good play and analyzing it in your
own like calculator and saying okay you
know maybe actually I'm gonna use this
for this and this and this or maybe you
don't even realize and you just wind up
in that spot and you've seen someone do
that and you like it and you make like a
similar play and that and it's just like
it's with you without you even realizing
that it's with
[Music]
you I want to kind of take this moment
to to reflect and you know you're
currently at at the top of the mountain
even though the mountain keeps on
growing right this is just one of the
mountains what has been the most
important lesson that poker has taught
you accept things as they are and not
wish for something
different yeah this is also this is kind
of the key to not being frustrated
because usually when we're just
frustrated and angry it's we haven't
really come to terms yet with how
current reality looks right because then
you could you could say it even like in
a more poker way of you know you've got
to accept the cards that you're getting
dealt and not wish that you had
different ones I mean to be fair how how
how how many people and how much brain
power do you waste and like oh that's
such a bad River oh that's no it's just
a river like why why why do we have to
label it that this is not great oh oh
I'm in such [ __ ] situation yeah ex but I
do get I mean it happens I'm sure it
happens Happ s to you some or I I the
only human one here because sometimes if
in the wrong side of mind it does still
happen to me right they like of course
no everyone has like those thoughts and
like even thoughts that don't like
resonate with you are going to like pop
up and you know they're still going to
exist like in that
space you know I wanted to start closing
off this conversation what would you
like the main takeaway to be that people
get from I think we've talked over three
hours qu quite quite a long podcast but
you know you're a very wise guy so we
tried to extract as much wisdom out of
you as possible what what would you want
the audience their main takeaway of this
conversation to be so they're gonna
close up the conversation they're gonna
be like
wow um one of these things I guess it
bridges into the other and one of these
songs that I like it says if you think
of something it is so I want to like
what that would mean to me is something
more like no dream dream is too big
unless if you tell yourself that it's
too big but
for great things to happen you have to
believe in yourself if you don't have
that belief in yourself then you've
already stacked the deck against you so
it's like believe in
yourself and just keep
going you know don't let yourself keep
going don't yeah don't let anyone or
anything stop you
from what you believe to be
true W but then
also allow yourself to be
humbled Adam would you like to add
anything to to to the takeaway well I
have one unanswered question so I want
to really just dive in with that so you
mentioned earlier what you need to
perform at your best and you said number
one was sleep I was curious to know
what's number two to five for Brin to
performance as best let's say you're
going to a super high roller final day
what are some of the things that are
really important to make sure you show
up as your best self okay so my biggest
winning year was in that 2019 year and
it was a bit different than like all my
other years like in those years what I I
would say the most important things were
um eating good clean food rest taking
proper like supplementation to be
prepared like in that moment some of it
was like brain pills some of it was like
this like a green energy drink that I
would
bring um
and bringing laughter and balance like
in my life I think are so such
underrated things and especially those
aren't really things that I had in my
earlier years in my career making like
the storm tougher to navigate but uh if
you're going
through intense times if you can bring
like fun and laughter like into your
life it'll make
those much more manageable to get
through amazing thank you so much for
your time we'll wrap it up there and we
appreciate you spend the last three
hours with us yeah for sure I think it
was a great combo loved having it with
you guys all right what a great
conversation that was wrapping up
another great episode bring Kenny thank
you very much for sharing all your
wisdom Adam any main takeaways I mean
there must be so many main takeaways but
you know not to repeat the whole podcast
just a couple ones yeah the main ones I
want to dive into or just reflect on are
dreaming big and having that big picture
dream I think anyone listening to brain
could be inspired by his ability to
think outside the box but to set a goal
that's scary ambitious but it's it's big
thinking being the best poker player in
the world starting a pokker site
anything he does he he allows himself to
think big and have a big dream then we
talked about like kind of having the
belief and confidence in yourself to uh
to keep going to keep going and some
very challenging things for a lot of us
to relate to even myself in terms of how
he thinks about risk being willing to
put everything on the line for the
belief in a better outcome or belief in
your kind of dream vision and for him
he's got that so um entwined that he
always will sacrifice everything almost
to get that to where he wants to go this
can lead to Big Ups big downs but also
it leads to him always being on the path
and always uh backing himself to find
answers so this relinks to climbing the
mountain I had the analogy I mentioned
the hero's journey as we going through
it but climbing the mountain and
leveling up your character every step of
the way so he's trying to get to the
best Pok player in the world and he's
constantly learning lessons and one of
the things that allowed him to
continually grow and level up was this
mindset of acceptance accepting
everything that happens and having this
holistic view of everything is happening
for a reason life has given me this
challenge to learn from it to grow
therefore I accept exactly what life has
given me and I will move forward which
links into him being very present in the
moment he always thinks about being uh
in the moment and trying to act from
that lens not getting caught up in the
narrative trying to give himself
creative permission to uh be himself and
express himself but yeah the ability to
move on except I thought was really
powerful you also mentioned surrendering
surrendering to life and we don't know
how life's going to unold we can set a
direction like might have other plans
and being okay with that and then I
think what we didn't really speak about
as a concept I thought was a theme
throughout the conversation was
resilience he's very good ad he
mentioned digging himself out of a hole
and this is the ability to things get
badly continue to move forward he
mentioned holding on to the roller
coaster when the roller coaster crashes
and miling into the hall and he's
definitely either had a lot of
resilience but most likely he's built
resilience through adversity he's went
through more downs and swings than
almost any of us will be able to relate
to like the amount of times he's went
negative a million is quite crazy to to
think about but he's built resilience
that that's normal to him he can handle
it and he says when things get badly I
back myself to take that as armor take
that as fuel and to get back to it in
keep marching forward so yeah I think
those are amazing life skills I think
yeah anyone listening would learn a lot
from that so any about the main topics
he wrote
down what really fascinated me is that
he really takes in consideration a
couple things actually he takes in
consideration the human aspect of Poker
and he really zooms out and really sees
it in the bigger picture so he doesn't
really look at the EV of the hand in a
vacuum he every time mention things that
are like bigger picture EV wise right
and then he talked a lot about
maneuvering so I remember he talked
about oh yeah should you really defend
Jack for offit where it makes 0.1 BB he
also understood that okay what you see
in the solver in the charts and the EV
it's in a static model where in the real
world we don't play in a static model so
what we have to do is figure out well
okay in which kind of scenarios is Jack
four offsuit going to be plus 0.5 or
minus 0.5 and that's he mentioned like
oh if you play against a guy who's
winning all the tournaments feeling very
confident he's probably goingon to play
very good he's gonna follow up with a
lot of aggression so probably we should
not be defending Jack for offood versus
this specific opponent so he's talking a
lot about elasticity in your prefab
ranges and maneuvering around the table
right playing more versus guys who are
weaker maybe low in confidence and
playing less for the guy who's winning
all the titles is probably uh not a
great idea I also talked about like
creativity and giving yourself the
permission to be creative also Stephan
talked about it so if Stefan and both BR
talk about it both online and live
Geniuses there's probably some truth in
it let poker be an expression of your
creativity and how do you do that you
have to go in not with the question of
what do I have to do here but what can I
do here because in can I do lays I don't
know how many possibilities right we can
start playing around with the variables
well what happens if this changes what
happens if this changes then suddenly
poker becomes very creative and becomes
a lot of fun okay so focus on the impact
certain variables have on strategies
instead of just copying the strategies
blindly this actually a topic where
we've touched on before but also what
brim really talked uh about and I think
opens up our mind with all the
information that's actually available
right I never thought about walking in a
tournament room and seeing who's
confident and based on that staying out
of his way right but it's a piece of
information that he has that he knows
will determine the EV of his play right
we can talk about Tails both physical
tells timing Tails Etc these are all
pieces of information that we can pick
up that gives us a more accurate picture
about what his range really is and
that's when Brin is really good at like
trying to figure out people are too
strong too weak and then try to maneuver
himself towards Victory like he did in
many many tournaments all right great
