we're here today with Matt Martinelli

[03:46]
we're here today with Matt Martinelli
Matt welcome to the pot
hey thank you for having me
well
let's start off
at the beginning of when your poker
career really started off I know you got
into touch with poker I think it was in

[04:00]
into touch with poker I think it was in
the Jamie gold era that's I think when
you first got in touch with the game you
thought it was cool you started to play
some poker on the side but was mainly
focused on your education later pursued
a career in filmmaking however after a
while you realize you were no longer
happy with where the filmmaking career

[04:16]
happy with where the filmmaking career
was going and you decided to pursue
poker full time instead
I was wondering did you already have a
lot of experience playing prior to this
decision and why did you think becoming
a professional poker player was the way

[04:31]
a professional poker player was the way
forward for you
um a little bit yeah I did have
experience but I think
um if I were to give someone credit it
would be Nick Howard and his uh just
kind of his social media Presence at the
time really uh inspired me to kind of

[04:47]
time really uh inspired me to kind of
give it a shot
what was it about uh
the the social media presence of Nick
that made you believe that you know be
becoming a professional poker player was

[05:01]
becoming a professional poker player was
an option for you
well first of all he has a cult
following so of course I just got
absorbed no uh you know I think for I
mean first of all he did a great job of
just marketing himself because he was
kind of everywhere he had this really
famous run at once blog at the time he

[05:16]
famous run at once blog at the time he
had a twitch stream YouTube channel and
I think I mean what made it so
accessible is that it was also free so I
could watch all of you he had tons and
tons of YouTube videos that I would
watch
and I just thought the way that he spoke

[05:32]
and I just thought the way that he spoke
about the game was incredibly
interesting and it sort of sucked me in
and the other part of it too is that you
know he was an he is an American me
being an American and we were gonna
um I'm just going to relate to him more

[05:45]
um I'm just going to relate to him more
and he was kind of posting these graphs
where he was winning like a crazy amount
on I guess bodog at 5 10 and 10 20. and
thinking like oh my god like people can
win it like 10 big binds for 100 at 5 10

[06:00]
win it like 10 big binds for 100 at 5 10
and above on on sites that I could play
on if I played poker that sounds uh
sounds pretty interesting so just kind
of poked me in
now obviously you know that's uh that
was I think Nick's result or maybe some
of his students results where did the
belief come from that

[06:16]
belief come from that
you would be able to do that yourself as
well I didn't know for sure before I
started I I think
um when I decided I was going to apply
or something I had to put in a sample at

[06:30]
or something I had to put in a sample at
like 25 NL and I was incredibly driven I
can't even believe I was putting in this
many hours of just like pumping and
volume at 25 and I'll just to like prove
I can beat the game I can win do all
this stuff and to have like an
impressive sample to send in when I was
going to apply and I was kind of using

[06:47]
going to apply and I was kind of using
his free content to the best of my
ability and it seemed like it was
working pretty well so that gave me an
initial inkling or feeling that it could
work out but you don't really know that
you can do it until uh you actually do
it

[07:00]
it
yeah there's always like a certain
amount of fear that's involved I we
usually ask people to ask to fill in a
questionnaire in that you you mentioned
that you are not necessarily a gambler
you like to plan ahead you like to play

[07:15]
you like to plan ahead you like to play
things safe what were some of the things
you took in consideration in regards to
I think risk management maybe we could
call it did you have like a backup plan
going in what were like some of the
considerations
you took before returning Pro I'm sure
there are some listeners here that might

[07:30]
there are some listeners here that might
be in the same point of their career
where they're considering maybe going
pro what are some of the things YouTube
in consideration or what are some of the
things you think people should take in
consideration before they actually turn
pro
sure so I think I was able to kind of

[07:46]
sure so I think I was able to kind of
maintain this combination of taking a
Leap of Faith with poker but also trying
to be reasonable and how much how much
risk I was taking on so in taking the
leap of faith I mean when I actually
applied for poker detox I told them that

[08:01]
applied for poker detox I told them that
I would be the number one player that
they ever had and that turned out to be
true
um by a lot
um so I wasn't afraid to advocate for
myself or believe in myself um
and it's sort of this drive that uh

[08:15]
and it's sort of this drive that uh
still it helps me quite a lot today
but I didn't just completely throw my
entire life into playing poker I was
still doing film and video stuff
basically in the entire time when I
started out playing 100 ml on stake up

[08:30]
started out playing 100 ml on stake up
to playing 510 I was still working
part-time as basically a wedding
videographer and also doing some small
time commercials
I don't even know if they knew I was
doing it I mean I was lapping everyone
and I was actually working a part-time
job but

[08:46]
job but
um I was kind of waiting to I think once
I got to the point where I was kind of
basically crushing two five that's when
I sort of knew that I could start
transitioning to being able to play
poker full-time and that basically just
had worked

[09:00]
had worked
what were some of your expectations
starting out did you set like certain
goals for yourself like ah if I don't
reach acts before this then I'll go back
to filmmaking or were you basically all
in
well I never thought that I wouldn't
succeed I just assumed that I would be

[09:16]
succeed I just assumed that I would be
number one so I didn't really think too
much about that so it there's a I don't
know it's a I guess it could be tough to
explain if I really thought that I was
going to be number one then why not just
quit your job well I don't know I guess
it's just kind of being of two minds but

[09:30]
it's just kind of being of two minds but
um I definitely always thought that I
was going to succeed and
I think
the main goal I guess when I started
with poker detox especially this was the
maximum and the contract was to get to
510 and to be making some sort of six
figure salary

[09:45]
figure salary
you mentioned you mentioned detox what
was the reason you decided to reach out
to coaching straight it straight away
when you
went full time like I know a lot of
players you know they first start to try
to figure it out the Minnesota and it
takes a very long time of pain and

[10:01]
takes a very long time of pain and
struggle before they actually reach out
to help why did you think it was a good
decision to straight away
jump it to I think it's the CFB program
you know people use it and are like yeah
I have to give away what all your profit
you know yeah I want to make money now

[10:17]
you know yeah I want to make money now
well it's kind of funny I mean there are
certain things like I guess whenever I
played poker before it was just for
micro stakes and as it turned out I
didn't become sauce one two three or
whatever just go straight to nosebleed
so I didn't see any sort of complete
Ascension so I was kind of partially

[10:32]
Ascension so I was kind of partially
being realistic about what I would be
able to self-generate
um another part of it too is because I
went to school and got an education I
mean I see value in getting some type of
education in the United States I mean
people would spend easily six figures

[10:47]
people would spend easily six figures
um to go to university to get any real
job where you expect to make money
and yet with poker sometimes it's hard
to get people to spend even a thousand
dollars on poker coaching so it's I may
be in the United States it's not even

[11:00]
be in the United States it's not even
that shocking to think that you're going
to pay to get some sort of training but
I felt like it would help speed up the
entire process much uh By quite a lot
and it did basically do that
have you well spoken the first thing in
which you seeked out for coaches to

[11:17]
which you seeked out for coaches to
basically speed up the learning process
or have you done it in the past as well
maybe with other things
um
I wouldn't necessarily call it coaching
but I could see even because I was a

[11:31]
but I could see even because I was a
wedding videographer
um one thing that it's more like an
apprenticeship where I was working as
like an assistant videographer to
someone that I really respected and
thought highly of and I could see how
much more quickly I was able to just
learn the ropes by watching them and

[11:46]
learn the ropes by watching them and
then move forward with my own thing as
opposed to if I just kind of went in
with no prior knowledge
um and so just kind of seeing you know
maybe if you don't even strictly think
about a coaching for profit as coaching
but you see it as an apprenticeship that

[12:02]
but you see it as an apprenticeship that
could maybe help frame it a little bit
better but you're just trying to glean
Knowledge from people that are more
experienced from you
yeah and it makes it makes a lot of
sense and probably
going forward during other in other
endeavors that you look at or something
that you want to get better and probably

[12:16]
that you want to get better and probably
looking for people who have showed that
they're very good at that and try to
have them teach you to speed up the
learning curve this is probably like the
first thing that comes to your mind now
when you try to get better in something
right
yeah exactly yeah I have exactly the
same it's interesting that indeed in

[12:30]
same it's interesting that indeed in
poker people people are not really
willing to invest in their career even
though if you look at the returns the
expected salary that you could get
compared to like other jobs where people
might invest like you said six figures
it's really weird that people are
a bit more

[12:46]
a bit more
averse towards investing maybe because
the education Market is more organized
legalized and the coaching Market is
maybe a little bit more over the place
back to that like there's indeed there
is a lot of coaching material for

[13:00]
is a lot of coaching material for
example out there how you already
mentioned you really aligned with Nick's
philosophy how does one
find a good coach that works for him
well I think I mean the most important

[13:15]
well I think I mean the most important
thing that you have to do is find
someone that resonates with you and
most likely the best way that you can do
that is through finding the free content
um going on YouTube Twitter if they have
a Blog if they're on run at once if
whatever they might have that would be

[13:30]
whatever they might have that would be
considered free content I think you
should I mean most credible people that
are coaches have something out there uh
that is free and if they don't have
something free maybe you could find
something that's pretty low cost to get
some sort of introduction
um

[13:45]
um
I usually expect like I'll give just
poker detox as an example even though
I'm not involved with it in any way
um they have like a 30-day training camp
that can get you like a sense of what it
might be if you wanted to do the uh
coaching for profit overall

[14:00]
coaching for profit overall
so I I think the most important thing
though is to find someone that really
resonates with you I'd rather find a
coach that I resonated more that was you
know beating two five than someone that
maybe had more credentials was playing
510 but I don't think I meshed as well
with him

[14:15]
with him
yeah I I can see that I've I've hung out
with quite a lot of very good players
and some players were very good when I
asked them to explain something they're
very bad and the other way around as
well like someone who might be less
of a good player in terms of in terms of

[14:31]
of a good player in terms of in terms of
result he might be able to explain
things very bad I think it's also it's a
different quality like I think what some
people know off game and what they can
consistently apply in game that Gap is
just so small and therefore you know
they're very good Crushers and other

[14:45]
they're very good Crushers and other
games might have sort of the same
knowledge of game to a certain degree
but then in game I don't know maybe
maybe like there's some mental game
issues going on maybe some performance
issues that it doesn't really come out
in the same way but then as a coach
actually for that person uh I might
really resonate with him

[15:02]
really resonate with him
um you've also done some coaching
yourself what in your opinion makes a
good coach and you also have a lot of
experience getting coached well in your
opinion makes a good coach
well I mean you have to take it
seriously it's a big problem that I
think a lot of online poker players

[15:17]
think a lot of online poker players
might have is that they just could see
it as some sort of variance free income
that they just sort of throw in some
hours but they're not really thinking
about coaching as a specific skill and
it's something that you have to

[15:30]
it's something that you have to
cultivate and think about deliberately
because if you know if you just phone it
in you're really not helping people as
much as you could be and the reason that
people don't do that as much is because
if you're a professional poker player
you are you like playing poker you don't

[15:45]
you are you like playing poker you don't
necessarily want to teach people or sit
around and talk to people or it's not
necessarily why you got into it so I
think just I mean first of all just
being very committed to coaching
specifically is a is a big part of it I
think

[16:00]
think
yeah I can definitely speak from
experience in my career I used to only
play and then actually for I think about
two years I only coached because I kind
of ran into this same problem if you
look at the amount of time and I think
maybe a lot of coaches have this they're
like well my EV in playing is this high

[16:15]
like well my EV in playing is this high
so I want to coach but I don't want to
put in too much time into the coaching
because that will be too expensive and
then they'll just find a way that's like
low low time invest and I found that
when I started to do coaching I wanted
to take it as serious as I was playing
poker and then I found the two very hard

[16:30]
poker and then I found the two very hard
to combine especially if you want to do
both at a very high level nowadays I
combine it a bit a little bit more and
yeah you have to accept that both might
not be at the highest level I do
definitely notice if I put more time in
one the other suffers if I put more time
in the other the other one suffers so

[16:45]
in the other the other one suffers so
it's almost like you know you're always
trying to keep both above above water so
to speak
um I wanted to touch on a point that I
think you mentioned I also read in
your blogs are quote because you
mentioned that your real career will

[17:02]
mentioned that your real career will
begin when you look in the mirror and
say I will do this with real conviction
I don't give a [ __ ] what I have to go
through I'm going to thrive
how do you build that conviction and
confidence in yourself that you can

[17:15]
confidence in yourself that you can
actually do this and what daily
behaviors did you implement to enforce
this sort of idea
sounds like something I'd say especially
because I'm cursing so it sounds pretty
you're free because as much as you want
on the bottom oh [ __ ] yeah

[17:31]
um it's a hard thing to really know how
to to teach to have this sort of kind of
fiery belief in yourself but I think the
first step I think that I was maybe even
laying out in that post is
I think it was first of all just stop

[17:45]
I think it was first of all just stop
listening to any sort of toxic social
media I mean starting with the ideas
that are even kind of coming into your
head is that most people let's say you
go on Twitter or like two plus two or
something you the most common thing
you'd hear is that poker is dead or
something or that the game is

[18:01]
something or that the game is
too hard or something like that but
we'll just say poker's dead
but I mean to some extent that's kind of
what people might want you to believe
because they're failing these are
usually people that are kind of micro
Stakes losers that are not succeeding in

[18:16]
Stakes losers that are not succeeding in
poker and so the idea that uh the sky is
falling the game is dead that's kind of
what needs to be true in order to
justify their own mediocrity so don't
[ __ ] listen to them you know if you
there's plenty of money to be made in

[18:30]
there's plenty of money to be made in
this game for anyone that chooses to be
great at it so just be great put
surround yourself with people that can
actually that are also proactive they're
working hard to improve themselves to
improve their game that kind of have
that they don't have a scarcity mindset

[18:46]
that they don't have a scarcity mindset
like other people
um they're I guess just putting it
simply just finding your tribe and I
think that's what really was a great
stepping stone for me in finding a
coaching for profit with people that I
was aligned with is that I just kind of
had this great Community where we could

[19:01]
had this great Community where we could
all kind of uh build together for that
time in our life
and I think if you are able to
I guess kind of stay away from the
negativity and just stay kind of have
your tribe working together with people

[19:16]
your tribe working together with people
um this kind of this sort of attitude
that you feel like you can do this
that's I think that's going to kind of
naturally develop over time
so I I really I'm a big time believer in
you are the sum of you know whatever the
five people that you spend the most time
around and I think that's another layer

[19:31]
around and I think that's another layer
of why I tend to really recommend that
people invest you know not just in
coaching really thinking about in terms
of a relationship and building
relationships with people that have
already done what you want to do
um because it it pays off in dividends

[19:46]
um because it it pays off in dividends
in ways that you you wouldn't even
anticipate uh when you're when you're
first starting out
I'm sure a lot of people would love to
hang out with a lot of very smart poker
players but how does one find its tribe

[20:01]
well I think one thing when if you're
starting out in microstates uh the
problem is like why you can't invest a
hundred thousand dollars into your
education is because you can't get out
of student loan for poker right it's
just not seen as legitimate so the best

[20:16]
just not seen as legitimate so the best
thing that you have to offer if you have
no money is your future profits that's
why coaching for profit is a logical
starting place for someone that is
playing microstates that are you know
basically someone with a dream

[20:31]
basically someone with a dream
um and so that's why
um you know publicly something like cfps
can get a lot of flack
um and sometimes justifiably so I mean
you even mentioned it and they'd be I
think in the beginning of like people um

[20:45]
think in the beginning of like people um
you know so why do I have to give away
all my profits This is BS or whatever
but guess what if you don't have any
money you have nothing to offer anyone
so this is your best opportunity and if
you have no profits otherwise then it's
better to give half of something that
you actually have than giving nothing of
Break Even exactly so I I would say it's

[21:02]
Break Even exactly so I I would say it's
probably
your best route to go that direction and
I think it makes the most sense for
people that have been stuck let's say if
you're stuck at microstates or small
Stakes for a long period of time let's
say you're playing for like a year and

[21:15]
say you're playing for like a year and
you haven't moved up in States I think
you need to be willing to try something
new and break out of whatever Paradigm
you're in because if you're just trying
to brute force it doing the same things
that you've been doing
um it's probably not going to be enough
and I mean even like let's say part of

[21:31]
and I mean even like let's say part of
your routine might be to have it run at
one subscription
now this can be great but the thing is
that it's also
like very impersonal in a way you're
just kind of getting into some big tub
of videos there's no personal connection

[21:45]
of videos there's no personal connection
there's not um
it's not much of a guided lesson plan
we'll say or there's no cohesive Vision
to uh run at one's coaching whereas if
you find a specific coach not only can
you build a relationship with them but

[22:00]
you build a relationship with them but
they also typically will offer a
particular cohesive perspective on the
game like someone might be more of a
theoretically oriented coach someone
might be more of a data driven coach or
a simplified strategy coach or something
some blend in between and when it when

[22:15]
some blend in between and when it when
I'm talking about finding someone that
you feel like you
um
like you really mesh with I think
usually they're a cohesive idea about
the game will be very appealing to you
yeah because there's you know people
like to like to hear that there's one

[22:32]
like to like to hear that there's one
way but for example also in the
questionnaires that we ask people for
the podcast we have many successful
guests on like what they fill in in
terms of how they approach strategy for
example when we give them two options
it's very different for players one

[22:45]
it's very different for players one
likes to simplify a lot one uses like a
complex type of Arsenal of things also
if you if you analyze games at the
highest Stakes to all winners and you
just take a random note there's
different strategical approaches so
guess what there is no one one way

[23:02]
guess what there is no one one way
and I do believe that like some ways
might resonate more with you and you
find that more intuitive and therefore
you can strive in that way of
approaching poker
does that make sense yeah of course and

[23:15]
does that make sense yeah of course and
it's going to be more fun you'll have a
lot less resistance when they're
teaching you something it's going to
work so much better if you're already on
board with what they're saying because
if you're not really a theoretically
oriented person and they're giving you
tons of like Po solver outputs you're
just going to be fighting the entire way

[23:30]
just going to be fighting the entire way
and it's probably not going to work out
in the Long Haul
I was thinking about also what you said
about the community because in your in
in your quote it did say like things
will get tough so it's not like you're
delusional and thinking that you know

[23:45]
delusional and thinking that you know
I'm just gonna write to the top but
there will be no struggles but you
expect struggles and
you think it's normal and therefore yeah
it's just part of the learning process
where I think at a whole people are
break even for a long time maybe and
then they go to the general Community

[24:00]
then they go to the general Community
well it was also Break Even or losing
and they're all like yeah you know
variance is tough uh you know you get
these kind of things usually pointing
outwards and what you have to do is
start to point inwards and maybe think
well maybe I'm the problem or maybe I
should mix something up you already

[24:16]
should mix something up you already
mentioned like run Advanced videos
there's also like
how you use things you could say like
yeah well I also work with data yeah I
also work with solvers I also watch
running once but how are you using these
tools right I like to make the
comparison you can put me in the nicest

[24:30]
comparison you can put me in the nicest
kitchen with very good ingredients but
yeah I still don't know how to cook like
I have the same tools to my disposal but
I don't know how to use them like a
professional chef right so it's also how
how you're watching these run Advanced
videos are you just you know do you have
a bag of potato chips lying on the couch

[24:46]
a bag of potato chips lying on the couch
and just you know using it more as like
sort of a Netflix or are you actively
trying to think like hmm why why would
he do that or what's a strategic
approach and maybe try to reach out to
him people also love to take right today
they want to for example message you or

[25:01]
they want to for example message you or
they want to message me even though
they're at maybe it's 1500 now and they
ask ask ask and instead of like hey Matt
how could that maybe help you you know
what could I what could maybe I could
start running some Sims for you that
that you don't want to do yourself and
you know when I provide them maybe I can

[25:15]
you know when I provide them maybe I can
ask you a question for every sin that I
deliver for example you know find ways
that you can actually add value to the
person's life and you'll be happy to to
give value back I see that actually in
my own coaching as well the people who
reach out to me and provide me with cool

[25:31]
reach out to me and provide me with cool
cool poker Solutions and want to talk
about it I'll I'll happily respond to
happily jump on a call with you discuss
no problem whatsoever
um
you
so you you joined detox

[25:46]
so you you joined detox
and I was wondering after getting
coaching
what did you realize was the biggest
mistake you were making in your approach
to Poker
before them what did I learn from poker

[26:01]
before them what did I learn from poker
detox yeah so I assumed they explained
to a different way of looking at the
game than prior
European your biggest mistake that you
were making in your approach to playing
poker well I think you know Nick was

[26:16]
poker well I think you know Nick was
really big on simplified strategies and
trying to make the game as simple as
possible and so I think when this was
probably like 2018 or something because
I know that's when I started he was
I think he was just kind of looking at

[26:31]
I think he was just kind of looking at
showdowns from from bow dog or whatever
the hell it is and where they show
revealed hold cards after 24 hours so
you can get a sense of what people
actually had and I think he was kind of
developing different intuitive
Frameworks for how to play the game like

[26:46]
Frameworks for how to play the game like
I don't know maybe certain actions might
be under bluffed or overbluffed or
certain things might be over folded or
underfolded and just kind of giving you
basic steps of how to play the game I
mean I mean one of them which is very
basic and obvious knowledge and on a

[27:00]
basic and obvious knowledge and on a
variety of textures just see betting
your entire range for one third or
whatever which a lot of people might do
depending on the texture now but it
wasn't as common back then where maybe
before I would have been thinking like
okay I'm on the Flop let's have five
different sizes and think about how to
memorize that and so a lot of it was

[27:17]
memorize that and so a lot of it was
moving away from any attempt at some
kind of GTO memorization and moving
towards uh different simplified
strategies that he was kind of coming up
with
but still to a certain degree I guess

[27:31]
but still to a certain degree I guess
play GTO only in a more set simplified
framework
um I wouldn't really consider anything
that Nick was doing at that time to be
that steeped in GTO I mean I just I

[27:49]
that steeped in GTO I mean I just I
don't think that's what was being
studied at that time I think he was
almost kind of reacting against it
um because I I think I mean he can tell
his own story but uh he I think he had

[28:00]
his own story but uh he I think he had
kind of gone down the GTO Rabbit Hole
whenever you know po solver came out
like 2015 2016 and uh basically found it
sort of futile and so he was sort of
rubber banding going the other direction
of not wanting to use that tool as often
um so I don't think he would have even

[28:15]
um so I don't think he would have even
opened up Pio saber in like 2018
um
it's interesting like I I usually
compared or I give the example when you
are more GTO minded you think way more
in terms of oh I must do this or I have
to do that whereas if you kind of break

[28:32]
to do that whereas if you kind of break
free from the model you're actually
starting to think yourself can I I think
that's a way better way of looking at
the game because can I might still lead
to mustai it might lead to the same

[28:45]
to mustai it might lead to the same
action but at least it offers
flexibility take for example a river
decision can I profitably call her with
my bluff catcher that's a different ask
question to ask yourself then must I
cover because most I call here is based
on the assumption that you need to reach
for example a certain defend frequency
because else you get exploited bloody

[29:01]
because else you get exploited bloody
blah blah whereas can I call here is
this simple as well is the guy bluffing
enough
and therefore I can call or I should
always fold obviously you can ask
yourself well is there long-term
consequences to overfolding versus this
specific player blah blah but you know

[29:16]
specific player blah blah but you know
most people that are listening I think
asking already starting with a different
question sends your brain in a different
direction which in my opinion will lead
you to make better decisions
um right because you understand the game
at a deeper level at that point because
you're thinking about what do my

[29:30]
you're thinking about what do my
decisions depend on
yeah exactly because yeah so so
obviously you know you've maybe looked
at the solver you understand it but then
you have to I feel like at some point
you know assault can really help you and
then at some point you sort of surpass
the solver again or at least you know

[29:46]
the solver again or at least you know
you're not trying to trying to follow it
if you've never watched the software
there's still a lot to learn if you're
only in solvers at some point if you
like it's also time sort of to move on
in a certain way if you understand what
I mean it's a bit more harder to explain
sorry for the audience uh uh but but I

[30:01]
sorry for the audience uh uh but but I
hope that makes sense would you be able
to describe how your experience playing
poker changed after after receiving this
knowledge
um
let me see

[30:16]
let me see
yeah let me think for a second how did
it change after I started basically
embracing the simplified well I mean in
a lot of ways I guess it kind of reduced
the decision fatigue of overthinking
every single decision I felt like I was
taking like some sort of really intense

[30:31]
taking like some sort of really intense
exam anytime I tried to play poker
initially but once I started getting
more of the simplified strategy it
seemed just seemed like a lot more was
taken care of for me which made playing
a lot easier uh first of all
um and I don't know I mean I was just

[30:47]
um and I don't know I mean I was just
winning so much that it just seemed like
it was kind of
um
the fact that I guess I was winning so
much validated the perspective that I
guess I didn't I don't really need to
think that hard about GTO or go that

[31:01]
think that hard about GTO or go that
deep into it at least not as much as I
thought I did
um so I guess in at that point in my
career at that time I mean now I'm
extremely like I think I came more full
circle
um ultimately you know much more
theoretically oriented now but it was

[31:15]
theoretically oriented now but it was
definitely an interesting I wouldn't be
the player that I was that I am now if
it wasn't for going through this whole
thing that
um really opened my eyes to playing in a
totally different way
because it was very counterintuitive

[31:30]
because it was very counterintuitive
why was it so countless
crazy stuff that poker was more complex
it couldn't be this quote called Simple
I'll give you an example
um and this wasn't even like I don't
think I don't know if Nick told us to do
this or if I just decided to do this on

[31:46]
this or if I just decided to do this on
my own but this is just an example of
how how you could play the game if you
wanted to so I got to 500 Zoom um on
ignition poker and I just decided that I
think it would be better if I just never

[32:01]
think it would be better if I just never
called pre-flop and I only three bet
um or folded even out of the big blind
and my reasoning for this is that first
of all I'm better than everyone post
plot and so I'd rather play a big a big
pot than a small pot and then the second

[32:17]
pot than a small pot and then the second
thing is that because it's Anonymous and
because it's uh Zoom I don't know who a
fish is or a recreational player and so
I always want to play a bigger pot
against recreational players if possible

[32:30]
against recreational players if possible
so just even on the possibility that I'm
up against the recreational player I
think it's better to just three bet
and also I had this insanely High RFI so
long story short I think my my stats
were like 33 32 to 30 three bet

[32:46]
were like 33 32 to 30 three bet
um and I
I think I wanted like 11.5 BBS adjusted
at 500 ignition
um it was probably the most insane way
you could possibly play poker and must
have been exploitable for like 30 big

[33:02]
have been exploitable for like 30 big
points or 100 or something and yet I
just kind of crushed the game regardless
and so that definitely gave me some I
gave me some confidence too
just playing like that is so bizarre and
making it work it was very very

[33:17]
making it work it was very very
interesting to say the least yeah I
think an experience like that kind of
opens up your brain to the question like
oh well if this is possible what else is
possible
exactly so it opens up your brain to
think more creatively about strategy I
would say actually it also takes maybe

[33:31]
would say actually it also takes maybe
an anonymous like I've never had any
experience playing on Anonymous pools
but maybe because it requires a lot of
confidence to use a strategy that's
against what the majority is doing
because basically you're saying that the
majority sucks and you know any better

[33:46]
majority sucks and you know any better
especially the higher levels you get
you're like hey oh your high six you
guys all do this [ __ ] that I'm gonna do
this this other thing instead it takes
balls
yes I'm a bold player you're you're
definitely a ball player but like I said

[34:00]
definitely a ball player but like I said
I can imagine that on an anonymous game
um there's obviously like some different
Dynamics because you don't have to think
about well okay I'm gonna have a 30
three bet think in a game where people
might track your stats at some point
like wait this guy is 30 three but like
what the hell is going on so in your

[34:16]
what the hell is going on so in your
experience because I know you also play
non-anonymous games
what are like some of the adjustments
you've made going from Anonymous to to
Anonymous and what are in general for
people maybe listening who are maybe
hopping between the two or only play one

[34:30]
hopping between the two or only play one
or decide to switch to the other what
are some of the things that they have to
take in consideration the fact that it's
Anonymous versus not anonymous
yeah um I actually just enjoy playing
regular games way more I don't really
like Anonymous I it makes me feel like I

[34:45]
like Anonymous I it makes me feel like I
enjoy actually playing playing against
specific people
um and getting reads on them and kind of
looking at their stats and handsome note
after I get a substantial like stamp
sample on them and so I do spend a lot
of time thinking about how to play

[35:01]
of time thinking about how to play
against specific people which would make
it kind of hard for someone to actually
easily I mean everyone's exploitable but
it'd be harder for someone to counter me
in a blanket way because I just sort of
intuitively play against everyone at

[35:15]
intuitively play against everyone at
least a little bit differently
um so I get I get a lot of value out of
kind of coming up with specific dynamics
that I want to play with with specific
people
and I guess your game nowadays when you
switch to normal normal tables from what
you mentioned you play a bit

[35:31]
you mentioned you play a bit
more within within a GTO framework so
probably your stats are less extreme so
therefore for example because I know
that like uh some people were used to
play Anonymous they hop for example two
stars and you know they learned in detox

[35:46]
stars and you know they learned in detox
that if someone checks back you should
stop so they run around with like an 80
probe or something uh yeah that you know
people people will will pick up and then
then you have a problem sort of
yeah yeah I mean it it's kind of a big

[36:02]
yeah yeah I mean it it's kind of a big
time Jump because this I think when I
was doing that it probably would have
been
like early 2019 so that was a while ago
so I don't play anything even remotely
close to that now it's a lot it's
significantly closer to playing

[36:17]
significantly closer to playing
closer to GTO with
um maybe trying to figure out how I want
to try to exploit specific players
um so I think I kind of came I mean I'm
also like my main game is 2550 on ACR so

[36:32]
also like my main game is 2550 on ACR so
it's you know a lot different you know
substantially different than ignition
poker what would you say like the the
main foundation of the simplification
remained but you
you keep your frequencies a bit more in

[36:45]
you keep your frequencies a bit more in
control compared to the Past would that
be a good description
yeah I mean there's things that I could
expand upon more I think there's a lot
of like I'm still definitely a player
that comes from this sort of mindset of
keeping things simplified and coming up

[37:00]
keeping things simplified and coming up
with ways to have simplified strategies
that are also very close to GTO
and I'm also
still just a very like I mean I don't
know what my opponents think of me but I
pretty fearless and aggressive player
um and that just kind of comes from just

[37:15]
um and that just kind of comes from just
being the type of person that would be
willing to three bet 30 at 500 Zoom
years
yeah you're gonna be an interesting
character once you get to nosebleeds
you ended up being uh one of the most
successful students
while many others of you who were in the

[37:31]
while many others of you who were in the
same cfp they received the same sort of
coaching they actually filled so what do
you think sets you apart and your
observation why did others feel despite
being handed the same content
are you smarter than them or more
talented to them or

[37:46]
talented to them or
what was the difference
well I mean I have no idea if I'm
smarter or more talented I wouldn't
really think so but I can't really
control that I can only control you know
what I do and so I know

[38:00]
what I do and so I know
I mean I when I just started uh that my
contract with poker detox I just hit the
ground running and I was just working as
hard as I possibly could and it was
really important for me to treat poker
professionally and not to treat it like

[38:15]
professionally and not to treat it like
but I worry maybe a lot of people do is
treating it like it's a video game
um you were kind of mentioning before
like how are you watching the Run of
once videos how are you doing this are
you are you eating potato chips and
shooting it like Netflix
um I think part of the problem is that

[38:31]
um I think part of the problem is that
people that want to play online poker
there's a lot of overlap between being
like a gamer so they're they're kind of
approaching it almost like they would
treat you know I don't know like playing
Dota or something of just like I'm gonna
log on you know I'm gonna just put in my

[38:45]
log on you know I'm gonna just put in my
time I'm not going to think that hard
about it you just kind of put in your
hours and hope that you just get better
whereas something like poker it's a lot
more important that you that you use
basically something called deliberate
practice which is something that I
talked uh quite a lot about when I was a

[39:01]
talked uh quite a lot about when I was a
coach probably it all we're sick of
hearing it deliberate practice but I
still just talked about it all the time
um I could talk about deliber practice I
guess and go into that
um basically deliberate practice I I

[39:16]
um basically deliberate practice I I
guess I read about it in Angela
Duckworth's book called grit and so
deliberate practice is a really focused
conscientious and effortful form of
practice and it's usually not very fun
in a lot of ways where you're you're

[39:31]
in a lot of ways where you're you're
focusing on improving your specific
weaknesses it takes a ton of attention
and a lot of times it's just really
boring so I guess I'll give an example
that she used in her book she was
is some I don't know like experiment or

[39:46]
is some I don't know like experiment or
something that was tracking young people
that were in a spelling bee and they
went to see how do these kids and then
like in a National Spelling Bee
competition and like how do these kids
perform in the in the contest and also
how do they study and

[40:00]
how do they study and
there are different ways that you might
study for it but the kids that let's say
they tried they study by just playing
Scrabble right like a fun game
those kids didn't do well in the contest
if anything that's more of a negative
predictor that they're going to do
poorly in this contest

[40:15]
poorly in this contest
the kids that well maybe they took they
quiz themselves like just kind of
General quizzes or maybe they went
online and had like a couple flashcards
here and there they started to do better
it's a little bit more focused and a
little bit more focusing your weaknesses
but it's not that specific it's a bit
more General

[40:30]
more General
but then the kids that do the best in
the competition are the kids that are
really it's a solitary work of like
you're literally like reading through
the dictionary thinking okay what's the
Latin root of this that or the other you
know what is this you know and then
ultimately what happens is that

[40:45]
ultimately what happens is that
deliberate practice is the best
predictor for performance
and the reason that it's so hard to do
this is because
you get into poker because you like to
play poker you don't like to you're
probably not an academic person you

[41:00]
probably not an academic person you
don't want to sit down and do boring
[ __ ] and think really hard about your
weaknesses I mean I've had to teach
myself how to use so many different
softwares and kind of like using hand to
know it feels like you're almost like
coding things line by line and it's just

[41:15]
coding things line by line and it's just
you're typing things into a spreadsheet
it's boring and it's boring to do that
every single day and to approach it with
a very serious level of consistency I
mean I can say in all seriousness I've
reviewed every six big blind pot or

[41:30]
reviewed every six big blind pot or
higher
um in the past couple of years but
definitely over the past year without me
so if you played me on ACR and we played
a hand that was that I won or lost over
six big blinds I reviewed it so
um and I used GTA wizard all the time to
help me do that but I have a very

[41:46]
help me do that but I have a very
specific and regimented form of studying
and I take my career incredibly
seriously
all right so if I can
if I understood correctly the main
difference was that they were not
deliberate

[42:01]
deliberate
about the actions they were taking they
weren't opening solver with a deliberate
thought in mind of like I have these
weaknesses and I'm gonna for example now
use the solver to figure out how to
improve on my weaknesses like they would
just open a hand and check the solver

[42:16]
just open a hand and check the solver
did I play my hand correctly and that's
it basically and if they would watch a
run at Once video again they're more of
the potato chip guy instead of okay I'm
gonna watch this video because I'm
curious about the thought process
because I struggle with this area so

[42:31]
because I struggle with this area so
basically you're turning to Resources
with a deliberate intention in mind of
okay I need to improve on these
weaknesses and I'm gonna use this
resource now strictly
to improve these weaknesses and probably
it's the same with playing right you set

[42:45]
it's the same with playing right you set
a certain intention before a session
like I usually before I play I always
open like little notepad and I'll start
right down like okay how can this
session today improve me as a poker
player what should I be focusing on so I
said a couple of like Focus points for

[43:01]
said a couple of like Focus points for
myself and what this does is your your
brain will start to look for situations
where you can actually improve as a
player so I'm a very big fan of at least
before your session sit down like okay
while I'm trying to achieve in this
session how can this session help me in
any sort of way
yeah yeah I've done similar things I

[43:16]
yeah yeah I've done similar things I
mean if I feel like I have a a line or a
zone that I'm not doing as well and I
might set an intention like okay maybe
I've been over folding to half pot C bet
and two bet pot out of position like a
very specific thing so I'm going to

[43:31]
very specific thing so I'm going to
focus if that happens I'm going to make
sure that I'm actually defending
properly and I mean even like there's a
layer of it that is you have to spend
time to even know what your weaknesses
are it's not even enough to just use the
tools correctly sometimes you have to
use the tools to reveal what your

[43:46]
use the tools to reveal what your
weaknesses are
um so
there's just a lot of layers to it it
actually makes a lot of sense right yeah
but wait what you meant like a lot of
players go into poker because they don't
want they don't like an advice job or
they don't want to do all these things

[44:00]
they don't want to do all these things
and basically now you're saying yeah
well in order to become good at poker
you have to treat it like a job and
people like yeah I got into poker
because I didn't want to have a job
yeah sorry about that yeah exactly I
mean if you want to be great I mean I
don't know I I I I I do recall who said

[44:15]
don't know I I I I I do recall who said
this on the podcast but one of our
previous guests I don't recall who he
also said like well I'm a professional
now so I'm going to take things
professionally
right they really at some point it's
switched like I'm no longer an amateur
I'm a professional and with a
professional comes certain standards

[44:30]
professional comes certain standards
that you do right like I said you do you
put in certain work uh or you know you
plan your schedule you play certain
hours not like oh well I don't feel like
it today so I don't play now you're a
professional now so you're gonna put in
your hours

[44:45]
your hours
um so that's kind of so maybe yeah
exactly like being being very deliberate
is kind of what then sets you apart
hi guys Renee aka the weko here with a

and maybe you will get a chance to work
with me and Adam and make more progress

[46:45]
with me and Adam and make more progress
in your poker career but for now without
further Ado let's get back into more
goodness in today's episode
um Adam
how deliberate were you in your
approving I definitely feel like you

[47:00]
approving I definitely feel like you
probably resignated with Matt
in this time yeah 100 yeah I think
deliberate practice is one of those
things that we can talk about and it's
sometimes hard to understand what
actually means but generally it's been
very intentional about what you're doing
trying to learn in a very uh coherent

[47:15]
trying to learn in a very uh coherent
way and it's often doing boring and not
this stuff that you repeat over and over
and I think it as you've talked about
today a lot of poker players kind of
don't get into poker with that mindset
they don't really want to do the hard
solver stuff the hard work I think enjoy
the game it's fun it's this enjoyable

[47:30]
the game it's fun it's this enjoyable
thing and at some point to keep
progressing you need to put the hard
stuff in this kind of pursuit of kind of
Mastery so yeah I think I learned this
concept from Malcolm Gladwell he kind of
turned the 10 000 hour rule which kind
of overlaps with this that's what must
be talking about of you need to put 10
000 hours roughly to kind of concept of

[47:46]
000 hours roughly to kind of concept of
deliberate practice which is this hard
work and you might only do what one to
three hours a day if this really hard
work it's the tough stuff it'll be not
done over time the kind of good news is
almost Nobody Does it so the reason Matt
is speaking to us today from this high
vantage point is because he's done that

[48:00]
vantage point is because he's done that
for prolonged period of time and most
other people haven't so right now we're
talking about as a high stakes player
and I just want to unpack your story to
get in here obviously you didn't wake up
and just start playing high stakes so I
want to unpack your journey and some of
the lessons that you've learned that's
hopefully the audience can resonate with
so I think you mentioned that you were

[48:15]
so I think you mentioned that you were
made away from kind of 100 NL to 5knl in
the space of two years which is rapid uh
in that kind of quick Journey with any
setbacks or challenges that you can
remember to heart that will particularly
challenging during that period

[48:31]
challenging during that period
sure
um there were
there were a couple different I'm sure
in just those two years
um I think probably one of the ones that
jumps out the most is me trying to get
to 10 20 and basically getting crushed

[48:45]
to 10 20 and basically getting crushed
over and over again
um and I'd done so well to start off my
contract and
you know I had to add it wasn't even in
my contract to do 10 20. I had to like
Advocate to Nick Howard like hey you
should let me do this yada yada and you
said okay and then I just got to meet I

[49:00]
said okay and then I just got to meet I
think I like lost like I don't even know
I lost 18 000 or something I'm like a
couple of days just immediately and so
okay now I'm in makeup and I have to go
back down and I'm grinding it back up
it's taking a while and then I decide
like okay I want to try 10 20 again lose

[49:15]
like okay I want to try 10 20 again lose
again and have to go back in the makeup
and it was this thing I think maybe over
the course of
um four and a half months where I was in
makeup
um
kind of like shot taking 10 20 then

[49:30]
kind of like shot taking 10 20 then
going back down to 510 and you know I'm
living in Los Angeles it's an expensive
city and relatively speaking I'm still
new to solo just doing poker without any
other
um income aside from my wife's income

[49:45]
um
and so it was just kind of a really
difficult time and also in some ways a
character defining moment because
there's this sort of Temptation of
thinking like well I'm already crushing
or whatever 5 10 I should just stick to
playing 510 I shouldn't because I
basically took three different shots of

[50:01]
basically took three different shots of
10 20 and I lost about I think I lost 52
000 playing 10 20 over these three shots
um and so it's tempting to decide I'll
just play 510 I mean I don't need or
maybe I can just take a ridiculously
long time and just wait till whenever to

[50:17]
long time and just wait till whenever to
play 10 20. but I think I'm just too
much of a competitor to just uh not
continuously just keep trying to do this
because over time I mean like I started
out saying I wanted to be the number one

[50:30]
out saying I wanted to be the number one
player
um in poker detox But as time went on I
think it just began I wanted to be the
number one player in online six Max and
so the way that you're going to do that
is by shot taking playing against the
best players and I guess you gotta you

[50:46]
best players and I guess you gotta you
have to invite a lot of pain it's going
to be a lot of struggle So eventually I
think I tried it it was my fourth shot
that eventually worked and what
ultimately wound up kind of changing my
life a little bit is
um

[51:00]
um
the fourth shot eventually I won a
hundred thousand dollars in one month
and at 10 20 and
uh yeah that sort of established me I
guess as a Crusher or whatever
um so these three challenges sorry these
three shot ticks that played so to speak

[51:16]
three shot ticks that played so to speak
we were down 52k here what made do you
want to continue so you've mentioned
like you've got this kind of inner drive
to be the best the best in detox and the
best of your formats but at the same
time there's a lot of kind of
conflicting kind of results coming back
at you which is going to get you to
question things so first of all why did

[51:31]
question things so first of all why did
you continue to keep going at the two
cares and was there any skills that you
had to develop over this period that
helped you break through to that
profitable month
well I think it did help to I think
after I was in makeup for a while I

[51:45]
after I was in makeup for a while I
needed to kind of take a break from
continuously kind of banging my head
against the wallet in this process of 5
10 to 10 20 and back and forth so I
actually wound up playing on some app
games for a little bit which are when I
think back on it it's hilarious me

[52:00]
think back on it it's hilarious me
playing on these like these ridiculous
like Chinese apps
um but it kind of actually got me to and
it's a little dramatic to say but like
kind of falling in love with the game
again of like learning this different
thing because it was such a crazy format
where it was like there's a two blinds

[52:16]
where it was like there's a two blinds
and a straddle and an auntie and it's
like 60 big blinds deep and it's all
like it's all written in Chinese so I
had to like use Google Translate to like
understand what all the buttons did and
but it was just kind of like learning a
slightly different format on what I was
already doing

[52:30]
already doing
um but wound up ultimately I guess
crushing that even though
pretty I'll say it was very shady and
but I basically got all the makeup just
playing in these apps and then after
that I think I kind of just gave me a
different perspective I don't think I
had any sort of amazing Revelation it

[52:47]
had any sort of amazing Revelation it
was just more being able to take a
breath from this cycle and
um applying myself to just taking
another shot at it
um and in terms of why you continue to

[53:01]
um and in terms of why you continue to
um do this I mean
it's not easy to say it's just that I
it's kind of like you are who you choose
to be and the person that I want to be
is this high-stakes Crusher because that
brings me satisfaction and meaning

[53:17]
brings me satisfaction and meaning
um I think there's there can be you know
honestly like a lot of Beauty in a in
the level of high in the Premiere
Performance
um in any sport and I like to try to
treat poker like a sport and so I think

[53:32]
treat poker like a sport and so I think
I'm not saying objectively speaking that
everyone should try to be the greatest
whatever I mean that's just for me what
gives me meaning is the pursuit of this
greatness
so it made sense that if this is the
type of person that I want to be and
this is where I want to go I'm going to

[53:46]
this is where I want to go I'm going to
have to cross this bridge
you mentioned in your questionnaire with
us before we jumped on the air that
you're pretty Fearless during this
period does this mean that you didn't
experience fear or that you had the
courage the courage to push past it and

[54:00]
courage the courage to push past it and
what was your inner kind of self-talk
like during these field attempts
foreign
well of course I mean as you are going
to know like it is scary I mean you're
going to be afraid I mean I wasn't sure
if I would need to start working
part-time to some extent if I needed to

[54:15]
part-time to some extent if I needed to
pick up some hours because I wasn't that
far removed from working on a regular
job so I was kind of contemplating what
should I be doing and I certainly didn't
want to go back I didn't want to go
backwards
um so usually for me when I get into any
sort of downswing my response is to

[54:32]
sort of downswing my response is to
double down and just start I just think
of like I'm digging myself out I'm just
digging and so I just start working like
as hard as possible
um to to basically get myself out of
that
um I don't but I don't I wouldn't say
that I'm feeling like actively every day

[54:46]
that I'm feeling like actively every day
waking up in Terror or fear I think it's
more of
you know
and working a regular job is a is a good
motivator for the average poker player
up to like oh I don't want to do that so
it gives you a reason to uh get up and

[55:01]
it gives you a reason to uh get up and
work extra hard I think
I want to touch on identity now because
you just mentioned the second ago you
all who you choose to be which I thought
was very powerful and I saw on your blog
you wrote that one of your contributors
to your success was I made great

[55:16]
to your success was I made great
decisions of the person I wanted to be
and this is really powerful in terms of
shaping the version of you you want to
be going forward so my question is what
specifically did you decide and how did
you make these changes in your life as a
result

[55:31]
well I just I think it all kind of
revolved around me being as committed as
I possibly could be to this goal and no
matter how afraid I was going to be or
how hurt I was going to be I mean I'm

[55:45]
how hurt I was going to be I mean I'm
pretty sure I cried at some point from
the downswing of just being in makeup
for months and months and months it was
just it was too much emotionally but I
would never let that stop me
um from continuing to

[56:00]
um from continuing to
pursue what I wanted to do I wouldn't I
wouldn't let fear you know stop me and
it's something that I would
you know maybe something I would impart
to people that are playing smaller
Stakes
um especially younger people that want
to get into the careers understanding

[56:15]
to get into the careers understanding
that like this game is going to be just
a ballroom brawl like from beginning to
end like the the problem a little bit is
if you let's say you look in the look on
look on social media or look for
different coaching sites and offerings

[56:30]
different coaching sites and offerings
you're going to think that people are
winning all the time it's all chip porn
it's all like hey look at my graph I
played a 20 000 hand sample and one you
know whatever amount of money
and yeah it's like you kind of only see
the winning but people are not sharing

[56:45]
the winning but people are not sharing
the losing so much I mean Adam there's
people that are in the coaching industry
that are sharing individual winning days
this is like a slap in the face I mean
and it's going to give people the wrong
idea of just how hard it is like it's

[57:01]
idea of just how hard it is like it's
just a slog from beginning to end and
something that in a lot of ways can
relieve my anxieties about when I'm
going through them is just reminding
myself that it's going to be a ballroom
brawl it's going to be a fight
from beginning to end so you're not as

[57:15]
from beginning to end so you're not as
surprised when it happens like yeah I
might sit down and I might lose some
five figure amount today
that's yeah that's basically part for
the course that's probably what's going
to happen but that is just a part of the
process and so being realistic you know

[57:30]
process and so being realistic you know
with yourself and me just telling other
it's important for me to tell people
like that I've I've gone through
stretches where I've lost 52 High six I
went on a hundred thousand dollar
downswing
um and it is excruciatingly painful

[57:45]
um and it is excruciatingly painful
um at one point I went to you know I
brought my wife and dog we went to
Canada and I went to play on GG poker
and lost money there
um and I wound up like running really
good on ACR and winning money on the

[58:00]
good on ACR and winning money on the
trip overall but I could already play on
ACR I didn't need to travel all this way
to go to Canada to play on GG and it
felt like a failure
um now maybe at the end of the year it
was a big success in terms of all this
other stuff but you have to think about
it in a really sometimes it might not

[58:16]
it in a really sometimes it might not
even be a year sometimes it might need
to take two years or however long it's
going to take but you have to just trust
deep down that as hard as it is I mean
this game cannot keep the good ones down
so if you're one of the good ones it's
not going to keep you down so just keep

[58:30]
not going to keep you down so just keep
fighting
I like that I like the medium reality
where it is and it reminds me of a
concept by Grant Cardone he's got like
the 10x rules one of his books and one
of his things is that the goals you're
pursuing in life are generally going to
be 10x harder to achieve than you

[58:45]
be 10x harder to achieve than you
initially think and for some people
that's enough to go whoa like that's a
lot of extra effort but I think it's
really good to realize that in poker in
particular it's tough It's going to be
like I said a brawl to get to that to
the goals it took me a long-term Pursuit
and it's not gonna be linear and there's
been moments where you question yourself
you have self-doubt almost everyone we

[59:01]
you have self-doubt almost everyone we
spoke to who makes high stakes has low
points where they're like is it going to
work for me can I figure this out I
think somebody's realizing it's supposed
to be hard most people will quit on the
pursuit if you're one of the resilient
people who don't
you've got a chance to make it it's so
uh I just want to quickly double down on
the identity thing that you mentioned

[59:15]
the identity thing that you mentioned
before so you that's it for yourself in
this moment when you're making good
choices about the person you want to be
let's say you create a vision of
yourself which is going to be this high
stakes Crusher you decide you want to
treat professionally but yeah look at
the amount of time you're playing 100 ml
or 200 NL there's a gap between who you

[59:30]
or 200 NL there's a gap between who you
are currently and who you want to be how
do you make a practical to start closing
that Gap how do you close that gap
between who you are now and the version
yourself you want to be in the future
sure well you just dress for the job
that you want right I mean I started a
Blog on the poker detox they had like a

[59:46]
Blog on the poker detox they had like a
little Forum that was kind of closed off
and I started a Blog right from the
start and said my aspiration is to be a
10 20 grinder and so I'm going to study
and put in the work like I think a 10 20
player should and so I just kind of

[1:00:00]
player should and so I just kind of
just showed all my different processes
now here's what I'm doing with po solver
here's my index cards for this of what
I'm working on so on and so forth and
I'm just and I'm also sometimes writing
just blogs about what I'm thinking about
but
um pretty much from the word go I was
just studying as if I was already there

[1:00:15]
just studying as if I was already there
and waiting for real I mean I already
knew I was the greatest I was just
waiting for reality to catch up to me
okay
um so I think just stress for the job
you want is a general statement
um how do people start to dress for the

[1:00:30]
um how do people start to dress for the
job they want and how to make it
practical so it's not just wishful
thinking so example let's say someone's
watching this he's playing midsticks and
he goes you know what I want to be the
next high stakes Crusher I'm going to
write down I'm the number one high six
Crusher I'm gonna start a blog as well
I'm gonna be the best player in the
world write it down post it I'm going to
change my name to Matt Marinelli

[1:00:46]
change my name to Matt Marinelli
yeah yeah yeah
so how does he make that practical what
does he have to start doing to make that
more than just words on a page or a
vision of the future
yeah I think it could be great to find
people that inspire you in some way and
see what are they doing and what are

[1:01:01]
see what are they doing and what are
things that you can copy about their
processes and take on for your own game
so I mean I don't think I had in
particular like if it's not like I
wanted to be like Linus love or
something but it was helpful that I was
in a cfp so people like you know Nick

[1:01:17]
in a cfp so people like you know Nick
Howard was someone at that time I could
kind of emulate some of the things that
that he was doing but I think having
some someone that you're modeling after
on some way that inspires you like to
have your life be like theirs

[1:01:30]
have your life be like theirs
um can be very helpful but you know I
don't think it's anything too crazy I
think on a certain level people
people probably know what to do they
kind of know what they should be doing
uh like I don't think I'm blowing
anyone's Mind by saying you have to
study and work hard I mean half I mean

[1:01:46]
study and work hard I mean half I mean
most of the problem I think is just
actually doing it and being committed to
doing it so that's when we were talking
about a post before where I was like
it's not like you're you succeeding is
not going to be about you getting
another run at once course are you
finding another PDF or whatever it's

[1:02:02]
finding another PDF or whatever it's
about you actually committing to this
journey with some level of conviction so
I think it starts a little bit more
internally and I think people will know
what to do intuitively
um I've heard you mentioned in your blog

[1:02:15]
um I've heard you mentioned in your blog
that grit is one of the key attributes
they'll love you to be successful I
think this ties very well into what
we're talking about now so grit can be
defined as bravery instrument the
character or courage and determination
despite difficulty there's also a book
by Angela Angela Duckworth sorry who you

[1:02:30]
by Angela Angela Duckworth sorry who you
mentioned earlier called grit which
defines great as a combination of
passion and perseverance and she
emphasizes the importance of long-term
dedication and effort to achieve your
goals now for you how would you define
grit for yourself and how is it played a
role in your success and journey to the

[1:02:46]
role in your success and journey to the
high stakes
well listen I take Angela Duckworth as
the authority so I'll just go ahead and
copy and paste the passion and
perseverance I mean I'm I'm playing
poker because I was passionate about it
right and I thought it would be cool so
I'll go ahead and take it but I think

[1:03:01]
I'll go ahead and take it but I think
grit has definitely been a big part of
what has made me so successful in
playing poker because I was just so
goddamn determined from the moment that
I started
um because I mean I wanted to back up
what I said when I applied to Poker

[1:03:15]
what I said when I applied to Poker
detox I said I would be the best player
and I intended to do that
um so I mean for me I think it's it's
been you know it's been essential but
probably the most important thing I
don't think I'm really that all that
smart or talented I just think I've just
worked insanely hard to to make this

[1:03:31]
worked insanely hard to to make this
happen how do you cultivate more grits
is it trainable or are you just born
with it
oh my I mean that's a big question I
don't know I don't even know how to how
to easily answer this but I I would want
to believe that it's something that is

[1:03:45]
to believe that it's something that is
that you can cultivate at least to some
extent
um because I'm also a proponent of
growth mindset
um which I think that's from Carol dweck
who more popularized it but just
believing that you can grow and learn
and that your traits aren't fixed so I
think that you can become more gritty

[1:04:03]
think that you can become more gritty
um but like anything else it probably
takes
um a lot of practice I mean just getting
and also probably having good Role
Models probably is a big part of it
um

[1:04:15]
um
I can see I've just put so much emphasis
on kind of surrounding yourself with uh
good people but I think it's essential
it shows it's an important kind of
attribute if that comes up often uh it
shows that it's been a big part of your
success so for you I'm interested to
know um obviously you mentioned growth

[1:04:30]
know um obviously you mentioned growth
mindset as well which generally means
you're learning from setbacks and often
when things aren't going well especially
the poker player it's really hard to see
the positives during a downswing that's
it for you for example nine months have
been in makeup when you come up to the
side you can look back and go that was
character building built resilience it

[1:04:45]
character building built resilience it
was a lot of fun looking back but in the
moment you're like this sucks this
really is tough so um I'm interested
enough for you how do you reframe
failures or setbacks as learning
opportunities as you're going through
them
well I mean part of what takes this
thing out of it is just kind of almost

[1:05:02]
thing out of it is just kind of almost
you know priming yourself at you know
losing and failure is a is a part of
this and so it probably that's probably
the thing that has helped me the most is
just
recognizing that you know failure and

[1:05:16]
recognizing that you know failure and
pain and suffering whatever you want to
say is a part of the game
um and when I'm when I'm able to kind of
assimilate that and accept it you know
if you if you're in the game and you get
stacked you can you don't have to be

[1:05:31]
stacked you can you don't have to be
upset or as upset you're always going to
be annoyed but you don't have to be as
upset about it and you can focus a bit
more on what you need to even be doing
um sometimes I have little things like
let's say I can sense that I'm getting a

[1:05:45]
let's say I can sense that I'm getting a
little bit triggered or whatever I might
have questions for myself that I might
ask like all right what could I learn
from this situation or from this hand
and some of these things that can sound
like kind of hokey to say like what can
I learn from this but honestly when you
ask yourself questions that inspire

[1:06:02]
ask yourself questions that inspire
self-reflection
they stop you from bitching and moaning
and complaining and you might actually
there's so many times where if I stop to
think about it like what could I learn
from this hand I might think like oh I
he checked back to flop with the nuts or

[1:06:15]
he checked back to flop with the nuts or
something and I didn't eat okay that's
something I could take away that this
person is capable of where if I'm just
like oh my God I can't believe you had
the nuts you know I'm not learning
anything from it so on you get kind of a
dual benefit of
on one hand you're not as emotionally

[1:06:30]
on one hand you're not as emotionally
not as tilted and then on the other hand
you're actually getting more information
you know from your environment and
that's going to inspire you to make
better decisions uh going forward you're
going oh I'll do that again I'll keep
thinking about what I'm going to learn
from different situations that are
popping up at the table

[1:06:46]
popping up at the table
um I love that it reminds me of a that's
called a formula from every dalio who
says pain plus reflection equals growth
so anytime you're going through a tough
period exactly what you said taking time
to go what can I learn from this what
can I reflect on that gives me the

[1:07:00]
can I reflect on that gives me the
opportunity to yeah take a lesson from
this tough time and sometimes it can be
just you play lip service to it because
you're not actually learning but a lot
of times there is there's lessons to be
learned there's things that you can I
can tap into or talk about those sites
stronger versions so yeah I really like
that so in terms of you being the best

[1:07:15]
that so in terms of you being the best
player you can be you mentioned in I
think it's in the questionnaire your
goal is to become the Michael Jordan of
online pocket first of all sure what
does that look like for you I like that
I like the big talk what does that look
like and in practice what are you
willing to do that you think others
aren't

[1:07:31]
aren't
yeah you know I think the Michael Jordan
of online it's something that is more of
an internal thing it's it would come off
like I I won't even reveal this because
it's a podcast and I'm talking about
this stuff it will make it almost
invites someone to say like who the [ __ ]
do you think you are uh certainly not

[1:07:46]
do you think you are uh certainly not
Michael Jordan I'll leave that to Linus
or wherever you know but that's the way
that I want to approach my career and if
it works out that way then it works out
that way
um but it's more about me treating my
career as if I were to become the

[1:08:00]
career as if I were to become the
Michael Jordan of online poker so that
includes me studying until like whatever
o'clock in the morning every day because
I'm you know on principle no matter how
tired even if I had my worst losing Day
Ever I'm going to review every hand
above six big fines or more I'm gonna

[1:08:16]
above six big fines or more I'm gonna
wake up the next day and I'm gonna like
I have my notebook with my different
things I'm supposed to bet pot facing
half pot C bet okay I have my 25 flops
upset I'm gonna do this Joel drill you
know I got to fill in this spreadsheet
fill in this hand to note pop-up
whatever I just have a process that I

[1:08:31]
whatever I just have a process that I
never deviate from no matter what's
going on
um I have a schedule that's really
important to me and so it's just this
obsession with process essentially is a
lot of what it comes down to
um and kind of having this goal of who

[1:08:46]
um and kind of having this goal of who
do you want to be or how do you want to
be it's kind of like your North Star so
you kind of know what your actions are
mapping towards
love that yeah it's almost like knowing
what your no star is and what you're
trying to get to and then doing whatever
it takes to to get there and for you
that's create a system a process to move

[1:09:01]
that's create a system a process to move
you forward towards your goals so I'm
curious to know could you walk us
through a typical day in the life of you
as a professional poker player what your
routines look like very specific from
when you're waking up how are you doing
your studying how much time you're
spending on each activity okay I'll be
really interesting for the audience

[1:09:16]
really interesting for the audience
sure so in the morning time I'd say
that's more of a focus or maybe like
early afternoon I'm focusing on strategy
development
so
um you know I'm just trying to think
because I actually have a white boy I
don't think you can see I have a

[1:09:30]
don't think you can see I have a
whiteboard behind me that has maybe like
10 different things on it it's like okay
I'm working on I don't know like
different pre-flop things so let's say
I'm working on pre-flop like I really
want to dial in some pre-flop thing
that's like usually deep stacks of some
complicated stuff so I might have like a

[1:09:46]
complicated stuff so I might have like a
separate Evernote document that says
like okay
I don't know like pre-flop 150 DBS in
this situation and I'll maybe I'll open
up simple pre-flop and I'll run a Sim
and then I'll have like an Excel sheet
and I'll type in different things so

[1:10:01]
and I'll type in different things so
it's very like I'm almost trying to
create it as if it's like a research
paper it's like extremely scientific
it's measurable it's something that I
will have something actionable to take
away to the tables as a result of the
work that I'm doing

[1:10:16]
work that I'm doing
um one of them could be like I usually
am making 25 flop subsets in po all the
time so some something could just be
like all right what is my see best
strategy going to be you know if I'm
squeezing out of the big blind versus
you know cut off in the button so
and then let's say or just the button

[1:10:31]
and then let's say or just the button
calls so I'll just put in the ranges in
Po and run a 25 flop subset and see okay
what's the average frequency
um that's C betting can I arrange that
yes or no no okay so how am I what's the
average C bet frequency what is what are
the compositions that could make sense

[1:10:45]
the compositions that could make sense
and then kind of go from there this is
the deliber product it's super like
boring I don't have fun with this at all
um but I see it is kind of necessary
because these are the things where I
feel like I'm taking the most away
because I know for sure I studied this I
wrote it down the writing down is a big

[1:11:00]
wrote it down the writing down is a big
thing for me because then it's like okay
I have like a notebook like extensively
of all these different spots and I
actually remember what I studied as
opposed to like all right you know
whatever I'm just going to run a PO
solve at the end of the day and then
we'll just whatever I remember I
remember it's more trying to be

[1:11:15]
remember it's more trying to be
extremely organized in what I'm studying
to get the most out of it
um just a quick question on that is that
a physical notebook you keep or is it a
digital one and how do you organize all
your notes and thoughts so that they're
in a place that you can actually go back
to them yeah so I have like an Evernote

[1:11:31]
to them yeah so I have like an Evernote
journal and I also have a physical
Journal so
I have a journal with pen and paper so
if I need to write anything down for me
to remember for later on usually like I
have a system of all right write it down
on the notebook then it makes its way to
the Whiteboard and if it's on the

[1:11:45]
the Whiteboard and if it's on the
Whiteboard I'll remember to get to it at
some point
um and usually in the morning times
that's my more over overarching strategy
creation time
but um
yep and I can keep going yeah and then
next okay so after that I I'm at some

[1:12:00]
next okay so after that I I'm at some
point I'm going to be playing poker
um um the best times to play you know if
you live the United States obviously are
going to be at night time so
usually my main game is playing 25.50 on
ACR I'll play anywhere from 10 20 to 100

[1:12:16]
ACR I'll play anywhere from 10 20 to 100
200 and the 200 400 uh no rattle games
but typically just holding the 2550
Lobby for as long as I can until maybe
you know you know Victor crudenov like
kicks me off or something I don't know
but

[1:12:30]
but
um playing is kind of the least
interesting part I think we understand
what that means but then studying
so after I let's say I play like a
thousand fifteen hundred hands whatever
for the day I will go and hold a manager
three
and I will copy all the hands that I

[1:12:45]
and I will copy all the hands that I
just played above six big blinds or I'll
just copy them all I don't know and I'll
import it into GTO wizard they have
their database analyzer and that makes
it a lot easier for me because what I'll
do is I'll open all the hands I played
above six big blinds so I'll have that
on one screen and then the other screen

[1:13:01]
on one screen and then the other screen
I have the GTO wizard thing and so
rather than having to go Hand by hand
and inputting everything into GTO wizard
it has all the hands already pre like it
already has the solves pulled up for you
so it's as simple as like okay I played
this hand here's the G2 okay this hand
look at this solve okay and so I'm

[1:13:16]
look at this solve okay and so I'm
basically just looking for any type of
mistake that I could have possibly made
or anything that I could be curious
about this is where I'm more creative
where it might be like all right let's
say it's a king seven three flop and I'm
like so why is Queen Deuce suited a

[1:13:30]
like so why is Queen Deuce suited a
better bet than Jack five suited and can
I I can allow myself to think a little
bit Rabbit Hole a little bit think about
okay how's it the blocker effects the
removal you know the not making
potential okay that was interesting I
don't know if I'm going to use that
specifically but that's that is

[1:13:46]
specifically but that's that is
interesting for me
and so sometimes I might have ideas I
make it to my whiteboard that just come
from like I wonder if I just I wonder
could I make check Min raise the size in
this situation I wonder how I could do
that
um if that's possible or does that make

[1:14:01]
um if that's possible or does that make
sense in theory and so on and so forth
but this is definitely a more creative
side and also it helps me kind of unpack
the day because when you're playing high
stakes poker and there's you have tons
of money on the line
you just kind of have to make you have

[1:14:15]
you just kind of have to make you have
to make big decisions and just live with
it and so this kind of helps bring some
order to the chaos and to just see like
okay from a theoretical perspective
where was I off base or on base with all
these different decisions kind of just
leaving no stone unturned
so with this post review well let's say

[1:14:31]
so with this post review well let's say
you've got a thousand highs to look at
I'm sure if some players try to
replicate this they might feel
overwhelmed like how are they going to
get through all those hands so for you
how do you kind of classify set in hands
as a mistake that you want to go deeper
and look into and how do you prioritize
which hands to spend time in on not to

[1:14:47]
which hands to spend time in on not to
get lost in just look at every hands in
detail right right so for what it's
worth if I play I'm Not reviewing a
thousand most of them you're folding
pre-pop right so this is if I win or
lose six big blinds or more
um and I think I just picked that

[1:15:00]
um and I think I just picked that
because I'm bomb pots on ACR it's six
big blinds so 6.01 I'll review it I
don't need to see me just check folding
trash
um so it is more approachable than it
sounds but the nice thing too with GTO
wizard is also tells you
um whether or not something could have

[1:15:15]
um whether or not something could have
been a mistake and it quantifies the EV
loss so it might be like if I see a hand
that says minus you know one BB all
right I'll click on that I know to pay
closer attention to that
but if I see something where it says
it's theoretically okay
I know that it's more standard I might

[1:15:31]
I know that it's more standard I might
just kind of zip through it pretty
quickly and not pay as close attention
to it
right perfect that's very specific in
terms of time spent on that how long
would it take you on average to review
your session for the day
and really you know it depends a lot on

[1:15:45]
and really you know it depends a lot on
also like how Intuit or interested I am
I think if I needed to get it done
quickly it could be done in 10 to 15
minutes potentially if I'm really
zipping through but usually I spend more
like 30 minutes 40 30 to 45 minutes
because I'm always there's something
that comes from it that I get curious
about

[1:16:01]
about
um pretty common for me to open up PO
solver and say like okay you know in GTO
wizard here you know it says this but
it's 132 big lines it's not 150 and also
you know I bet 62 pot not 75 and I'm
just curious about how to how that might

[1:16:16]
just curious about how to how that might
change things or maybe doing some level
of no knocking and so kind of letting my
curiosity
you know at least doubles the time that
it's gonna take
um but I would say probably a half an
hour is probably a good amount of time
to spend on that type of thing

[1:16:31]
to spend on that type of thing
yeah and after you finish your post game
review how was the rest of your day look
well at that time it's pretty late
because um it's American nighttime so
it's like all right it's almost uh it's
kind of for bed basically
so that's basically the last thing that
I would do

[1:16:45]
I would do
so then when do you get free time when
does when you're not studying a grinding
no I mean I have to plan it
um but
when is the free time I think I tend to
have more kind of on off days where I I
just kind of prefer to be either I'm

[1:17:00]
just kind of prefer to be either I'm
really working hard today where I'm kind
of taking off
nice so when you're on it's basically
wake up do your own routine and then
you're basically going into the kind of
deep delivery practice playing poker as
much as you can in every view in that
session and that's most of the ideas
that so to speak anything else you fit
into your ideas on an average day

[1:17:15]
into your ideas on an average day
average grinding day
well I think that's probably the most
important stuff um yeah I think that
basically sums it up
um okay great the strategy development
can Encompass a ton of different things
like all sorts of different softwares

[1:17:30]
like all sorts of different softwares
depending on what I'm trying to work on
but just as a general template I just
chunk it as like strategy development
playing and then review nice yeah I like
that I like having broad categories
which could also Encompass a lot I'm
sure certain days that goes off into the
hemispheres in terms of different things

[1:17:46]
hemispheres in terms of different things
you're learning but the idea is it's
probably more structured and you go
straight into playing uh yeah it gives
us a really good framework of how your
days look which is great and so I've had
a fellow some fellow public players a
detox play some particular talk about
you and what they think about you and
one of them says they admire you one

[1:18:01]
one of them says they admire you one
thing that they may the most about you
is as much
um as your upper down so for example you
could be down 100K in a month tomorrow
you're gonna wake up get some coffee
review your hands drill the spots and
then play it rinse and repeat I think
this was free nachos who said that so

[1:18:16]
this was free nachos who said that so
how did you develop this Detachment from
results and the ability to be very
process driven and short no matter what
even when results are going against you
well it probably just comes back to the
strong sense of building this specific
identity and focusing at just a ton on

[1:18:32]
identity and focusing at just a ton on
process and you were asking about like
can you cultivate grit I think some of
it is just going through these different
iterations and it definitely gives you a
lot of positive reinforcement when you
do stick to your process and then over a

[1:18:45]
do stick to your process and then over a
long enough period of time it works out
for you I mean obviously it hurts like
hell when you're just losing a bunch of
money and if you know you're just
frustrated but when you see that working
and really hard over a long enough
period of time seems to yield something
for you it uh it's very we'll say it's

[1:19:00]
for you it uh it's very we'll say it's
very encouraging to stick to that
do you ever
struggle to stick to that is there a
moments where you want to say the snooze
on that alarm you feel like the identity
you're trying to become is a stretched
too far and it's any like negative

[1:19:15]
too far and it's any like negative
self-talk you have to battle against or
do you feel like once you're decided you
can override anything in the moment
um
well
I would say generally no there's nothing
that derails me from this

[1:19:30]
that derails me from this
but there's there's times that I get
kind of exhausted from poker in general
I need to take time away so I don't I
definitely tend to be an all or nothing
type of person where if I'm taking away
from poker I'm completely stepping away
but what I would never do is kind of
half-ass it I'm just like just kind of

[1:19:46]
half-ass it I'm just like just kind of
showing up putting in random volume and
just hoping for the best
um so kind of just sticking to that with
your All or Nothing approach how do you
uh self-regulate that by that I mean how
do you choose when to push on so I can

[1:20:00]
do you choose when to push on so I can
tell if you have a really crazy work
ethic so often when you've got that
skill set you need to combat that with
some form of recovery and where to
recharge and some players might be very
structured have set days of the week off
I'm guessing from you potentially you
could take this off as you feel so how
do you kind of regulate when to balance

[1:20:15]
do you kind of regulate when to balance
the push harder and when's a good time
to take a break to uh to recover
well I guess the benefit of having
experience and doing this for a long
enough period of time you just kind of
have to listen to your body and your
mind you kind of know when you're being
stretched too thin or hopefully you can

[1:20:31]
stretched too thin or hopefully you can
learn this over time and I guess I just
take time off and I need to take time
off sometimes I might plan it weeks in
advance of saying like Okay I'm going to
I mean I'll tell my wife like all right
so this like the next 10 days or
whatever like you're not going to see me

[1:20:46]
whatever like you're not going to see me
or something you know I have to really
do this but then the week after that
like okay we'll go out go out to eat
we'll do this we'll have all sorts of
fun stuff we'll plan the party you know
all that
um so I think
even just you know I'm a very organized
person and I tend to plan everything so

[1:21:01]
person and I tend to plan everything so
even just planning just antis now I can
just anticipate I'm going to need to
relax I want any time off you know so
sending benchmarks that seem reasonable
or makes sense like I know for this
month I'm going to be working pretty
hard this month but I know okay starting

[1:21:15]
hard this month but I know okay starting
August 1st I'm going to take some time
off
yeah nice I like that it's like setting
a rhythm like a workflow of when you're
working and when you're recovering and
for you obviously you're a good planner
so you can do that by planning but also
you're very intuitive of how that feels
and when you'll need time off it's also
good to have a partner or a wife because

[1:21:30]
good to have a partner or a wife because
they can definitely put you in Balance
where you haven't seen haven't seen for
two weeks they're like hey can we I'm
here can we do something at some points
and you've gotta yeah that's a nice
version yeah yeah the supported version
yeah good stuff so run it yourself what
are your kind of practices look like in

[1:21:45]
are your kind of practices look like in
terms of how do you get that balance
between when you're working when you're
taking time off
um yeah what's the kind of your workflow
look like and how do you kind of make
sure you're not pushing things too hard
oh I see I see

[1:22:02]
oh I see I see
um
interesting question I mean it
definitely what matters I can relate to
a lot of things like that at some point
also you just feel like it and because
at some point you kind of get to know
yourself I kind of schedule for example

[1:22:18]
yourself I kind of schedule for example
I would say I I'm way more scheduled
like Monday to Friday or Monday to
Saturday nine to five that's how I like
to do it at some point also I was
wondering uh if I should push through
let's say for example It's Five O'Clock
grind them over but you have a good game

[1:22:32]
grind them over but you have a good game
what do you do right I'm sure people
have been in this situation like yeah I
should have continued shoot and not
continue I remember a good friend of
mine he said well I'll just calculate my
hourly if it's more than ax I'll
continue and if we continue on for more
than two hours or two hours more than my

[1:22:45]
than two hours or two hours more than my
normal session I'll just take the next
day off for example I think that's a
pretty good solution for myself
I kind of said like listen this is just
around my stop time so I don't care
who's at the tables I leave because for
me it was more important to keep my

[1:23:00]
me it was more important to keep my
routine in place so that the next day
I'll just you know show up and play the
same amount of hours so for me
personally just sticking to the routine
I think it's a bit more important then
on days where I might feel a bit off I

[1:23:15]
on days where I might feel a bit off I
think aligning your expectations like I
feel a little bit off today so maybe not
expect like the best of the best genius
place today so but I'll at least sit
down and it's funny thing when you
expect to play worse usually what comes

[1:23:30]
expect to play worse usually what comes
out is quite decent whereas if you go in
and you don't check in with yourself and
realize ah you know today I'm probably
not at my best and you go in expecting
your best you get very frustrated and
that usually is a very sloppy sloppy
slope down so I think kind of checking
in with yourself to see how you feel for

[1:23:45]
in with yourself to see how you feel for
example also before playing and kind of
aligning expectations accordingly uh I
think it's very important I usually also
scheduling just one day where I mainly
focus on strategy so for example I'll do
the same as Matt afterwards I'll review
all hints usually I create some filters

[1:24:02]
all hints usually I create some filters
exactly what Matt said very deliberate
based on okay uh uh this is a specific
spot that I'm working on so let's say
now I have like six filters specifically
where uh for example that my might have

[1:24:15]
where uh for example that my might have
one filter that shows me my strong hands
and if I and then I'll review if I got
the maximum out of my stronger Holdings
that's for example a filter I made that
I will review or I face a river bat in
certain situations because I don't want
to over fold or I might even just have a

[1:24:31]
to over fold or I might even just have a
filter I play a through a part out of
position because that's just a strategy
a a section of the tree where where I've
dived into deciding what my strategy
will be and I want to review all hands
that I played in a three web pod for

[1:24:45]
that I played in a three web pod for
example so I'll I'll do stuff like that
I think actually it was I think it was
Goose car also said in the pot guys no
session no next session is played before
the last session is reviewed and I think
this also doubt doesn't creep up and it
keeps you curious I have exactly what
Matt also said your viewer hands and

[1:25:01]
Matt also said your viewer hands and
like that trigger something or in-game
you know or you're like okay I'll do
this but I'll mark this hand and write
down like who I may be or in this spot
you know how does the ranges really look
like can I maybe do some research or is

[1:25:15]
like can I maybe do some research or is
this is this a thing then I'll then I'll
mark it I'll just play the handout you
know however I think it's best at that
moment but I'll definitely Mark like
maybe this is a thing I want to discuss
this hand and then yeah based on how
much of these hands you have yeah your
review can become sometimes a little bit

[1:25:31]
review can become sometimes a little bit
longer because you go down the rabbit
hole on some points and other reviews
you know they tend to flow really
quickly because there was not too much
interesting stuff going on so I I see a
lot of uh similarities in terms of uh

[1:25:47]
lot of uh similarities in terms of uh
what I do and what Matt does in that
regard I was curious Matt you talk a lot
about detox that's there been anyone
else beside Nick that had a very big
impact on your career and your success

[1:26:03]
impact on your career and your success
yeah sure I think
um Pat Howard who is his brother is
probably I mean he ultimately maybe
played an even bigger role or I don't
even know how to compare it but I mean
they I mean Pat Howard is he's he's

[1:26:17]
they I mean Pat Howard is he's he's
great what can I say it probably doesn't
get enough uh enough credit but he
um really complimented
a lot of skills
um when he kind of came along into poker
detox uh he complimented Nick's skills

[1:26:31]
detox uh he complimented Nick's skills
he compliment you're really in the
Howard family you married their sister
or yeah that's exactly what happened
I was I was also running you you
mentioned like strategy creation a lot

[1:26:45]
mentioned like strategy creation a lot
as a topic
um many players you know they use
solvers but as discussed is how you how
you use them
what do you feel like is a very
effective way to use a solver and what
do you feel like is a very

[1:27:00]
do you feel like is a very
what's the opposite of effect
ineffective ineffective way to to use
yeah well I mean sticking with Pat I
mean one thing that I really appreciated
so much about him is that he came in to
poker with a scientific background where

[1:27:16]
poker with a scientific background where
he had a degree in physics and he
decided that that wasn't really the path
for him and wound up kind of joining up
with Nick Howard and his uh coaching for
profit and you know I mean Pat just
brought this scientific perspective and

[1:27:30]
brought this scientific perspective and
it just blew me away just the level of
professionalism that he brought to
everything that he did he was incredibly
organized always like you know following
the scientific method it it felt like
reading the content that he was making
was like reading a research paper which
I really loved

[1:27:45]
I really loved
um
and so now when I do my own studying I
mean it's a lot of it is just kind of
using the same approach to treating
poker
scientifically and logically and all and
being also being very thorough and

[1:28:00]
being also being very thorough and
professional
um is basically the way that I do it so
I don't I tend not to run a ton of
random Sims and just see you know when
I'm in my creativity time that's okay to
do that but when I'm doing strategy
development that's what I'm like okay
I'm gonna make a 25 flop subset I'm
going to have an Excel page and I'm

[1:28:16]
going to have an Excel page and I'm
going to see okay on all these different
textures what's the average bet and then
what would the exploitability be
um that's another thing where like if
you're trying to measure how exploitable
is something you see okay like let's say
po solver is betting 90 of the time you

[1:28:32]
po solver is betting 90 of the time you
know in position might have a certain EV
and then let's say you do the same thing
but you no lock a range bet and then you
see the EV will change it's usually
going to go down because you're
deviating from GTO and you can see okay

[1:28:45]
deviating from GTO and you can see okay
how much did that did I lose by making
that simplification
and so like let's say it was one chip
out of a thousand chip pot that's you
know a tenth of a percent of the pot
that's pretty acceptable so it's like
okay I'll just maybe I'll just bet my
entire range in this situation but it's
having the you know the the discipline

[1:29:03]
having the you know the the discipline
to want to quantify these things and not
throw caution to the wind and say like
okay if this were like published you
know this is an experiment that would be
reproducible that's science

[1:29:15]
reproducible that's science
um and so it's definitely the way that
I'd like to approach poker because I I
mean it just resonated with me a lot I'm
also because I'm such an organized and
logical person but also because I saw
how well that it worked for poker detox
coaching for profit and the different

[1:29:31]
coaching for profit and the different
just what Pat contributed as a person
um so that's basically the way that when
I use solver it's usually a part of a
bigger project a more of a comprehensive
project
only only when I'm in my sort of

[1:29:45]
only only when I'm in my sort of
creativity time at the end of the day
will I kind of look at a random Sim
so then what's the difference because
you also mentioned like you review let's
say for example you go to GTO wizard you
upload your hands you review certain
hands so that's when you for example use
the solver to review a specific hint but

[1:30:01]
the solver to review a specific hint but
then when you for example electricity or
at least depending on when people listen
to to this podcast I know GTO is going
to come up with a lot of cool updates
where we can actually customize a lot
and actually build our own strategies
but for now for example I'll use bio for

[1:30:15]
but for now for example I'll use bio for
that because that's where you have more
of the freedom to determine actually
what your strategy is going to be right
like downside of for example a pre-soft
Sim with multiple sizings you can kind
of follow the hand but the ranges are
going to look very different at some

[1:30:30]
going to look very different at some
point of the tree if your opponent plays
a different strategy if you play a
different strategy and to come back to
deliberate again
if I just plug in a hand because I want
to know if I played the hand correct
it's I think not the optimal question
maybe to ask right if you're trying to

[1:30:45]
maybe to ask right if you're trying to
go through the hand trying to learn from
something I think you already mentioned
you look at the Sim and instead of just
looking at your hand you also see like
oh the queen Deuce is betting more than
the Jack five interesting why would that
be you're trying to learn a certain
heuristic from that that you can maybe
spot in other hands that you're
reviewing and that becomes a concept

[1:31:01]
reviewing and that becomes a concept
that you can actually start implementing
into your game so then when
when you then use piyo it's more for
like building the actual strategies you
run these subsets you determine your
actual size and then unlike certain

[1:31:15]
actual size and then unlike certain
terms okay how what kind of sizing I
will use now
sure yeah so it can help you kind of
devise the strategy for how you want to
polarize your range overall and so a
piece of it might be looking at just
frequencies but then some of it might

[1:31:31]
frequencies but then some of it might
also be
um figuring out what is the range
composition
so some I'll give you a different
example where I use GTO wizard because
um it was just simpler was looking at
River spots and figuring out just as a
basic question how often do I check the

[1:31:47]
basic question how often do I check the
nuts in a check call check bet mine or
like whatever so like in a discontinued
line how often am I trapping and so I
look at it the same 25 flop subset and
you know whatever uh have an Evernote

[1:32:00]
you know whatever uh have an Evernote
document Excel page and I'm just kind of
going through and you can just see like
okay because GTO wizard has the
breakdown a different range and
different hand strengths how often do I
check the nuts here and okay like and
I'll look at maybe
four different River cards and have like

[1:32:15]
four different River cards and have like
uh doing not that I have a significant
sample size and I can see okay
po or like GTO wizard check the nuts X
percent of the time so that gives me a
heuristic when I'm playing the game
where now I have a process for making a
decision I know what the Baseline is so

[1:32:31]
decision I know what the Baseline is so
if I ever get confused I have no idea
what to think about the blockers or
anything if I only have one second to
make a decision I know I have a
percentage in mind with the randomizer
for how often I would want to check the
nuts in this situation but you can't
really do that reliably if you just look

[1:32:45]
really do that reliably if you just look
at one solve in one situation it makes
it a little easier if you go through
lots of different things and type in
type it all in this is the deliberate
practice where I'm doing the boring
stuff so that when I'm playing the game
like I'm like okay I feel confident that
what I'm doing is at least close to GTO

[1:33:02]
what I'm doing is at least close to GTO
um or it just I don't know just keeps me
more well protected overall
yeah no that that makes a lot of sense
uh you can be like oh yeah I should
check from strong hands but what is some
strong hands can we make it maybe you

[1:33:16]
strong hands can we make it maybe you
know getting more so we can actually you
know in game yeah so I just I think that
it's important to think about things
probabilistically that's well that's
just how I tend to approach it so
um when you're talking off the air there

[1:33:32]
um when you're talking off the air there
um we
you know you're like people might make
different decisions and we say I'm not
I'm gonna hard exploit essentially
because he's never he's never betting
this or he's always betting this I would
rarely ever say someone is always or
never doing anything

[1:33:46]
never doing anything
but I did also said I like exploiting
specific people but I like having that
Benchmark to stay anchored to like let's
say I'm gonna bet in a situation 50 of
the time I'm like plus or minus 10 maybe
20 depending on the person or the

[1:34:02]
20 depending on the person or the
situation maybe I think something about
the blockers but there's always like
some kind of
um Anchor Point
um where I want to I guess that's part
of playing uh any kind of minimally
exploitative strategy which most people

[1:34:15]
exploitative strategy which most people
are playing nearly some level
exploitative
um is thinking about things
probabilistically
yeah I agree usually if there is a
discussion as well and I hear someone
say always never I'm like I mean we we
cannot say right you should always
account for a certain amount of let's

[1:34:31]
account for a certain amount of let's
just call it a random factor that a
certain random hand can be in here
because even for example within your
Baseline strategy you might say I never
have this or never have that you're
still human you know one day you might
miss a certain combo here there or you
make a mistake you know people can make

[1:34:45]
make a mistake you know people can make
a mistake and slowly have a different
hand than they're supposed to have so
you always need to keep that human
factor and that random factor in
consideration and yeah basically what
you're touching on there is the I think
when you build when you do your strategy
creation you create like a baseline

[1:35:00]
creation you create like a baseline
strategy right a place to fall back to
the thing that you will do most of the
time but you also mentioned indeed like
we have to take consideration that some
people play different but from the
Baseline strategy you can then oh this
guy fault says this guy faults more you
could increase your your frequency I

[1:35:16]
could increase your your frequency I
don't know if you are also then for
example you could maybe exploit if you
use a different sizing versus one person
or the other but obviously then you
might go a bit further down a different
road than you actually based on strategy
usually it's a bit easier to exploit in

[1:35:30]
usually it's a bit easier to exploit in
my opinion within frequency so you have
your Baseline sort of sizing scheme in a
certain spot and if you think someone is
exploited if you you just increase your
sizing it's very hard for people to pick
up on that where if you suddenly be like
hey this guy falls up to overbat and you

[1:35:46]
hey this guy falls up to overbat and you
just start inventing overbats in spots
where maybe another thing or like a
certain size there's another thing then
you might be surprised as suddenly this
guy who you thought followed a lot now
suddenly starts calling because you're
doing something that makes no sense
whatsoever and you were just you didn't
anymore think about the Strategic

[1:36:02]
anymore think about the Strategic
the overall strategic approach whereas
if I think if you just increase a
certain frequency with your bluff
catchers or your Bluffs it's very hard
for people to pick up on that so what's
kind of your thought about
sustainable exploitation so to speak

[1:36:18]
sustainable exploitation so to speak
well I mean I would say with that too
it'd be open to the possibilities I mean
you never know maybe maybe you're
missing something you could Target
people specific sizings more I mean I
remember my biggest pot that I won when

[1:36:31]
remember my biggest pot that I won when
I first played 2550 was against Berkey
of all people
and
um it was like playing 2550 in WSOP in
the year that we had coveted and so it
was like all online and I just had some
situation early on in the session where

[1:36:46]
situation early on in the session where
I just had the nuts and I knew that
Berkey would think that I'm just some
online kid that I'm gonna be over I
already knew that he thought that and so
I just had a I just had a situation
where I had to not flush and I just snap
jammed like 500 pot which was not a play

[1:37:00]
jammed like 500 pot which was not a play
in theory but I know berkey's going to
over call and so the way mathematically
to maximally punish someone is going to
over call us to bet maximum any snap
call to some trash Bluff Catcher And he
just it worked perfectly it was the
perfect exploit for that vacuum

[1:37:16]
perfect exploit for that vacuum
situation I had to have a lot of
confidence to just pull something like
that off I mean yes it would have been
easier to just bet three quarters at
about 1.5 but I guess you know just like
being thinking of what does it depend on
okay that's the way that you and Max

[1:37:30]
okay that's the way that you and Max
exploit someone that over calls this did
that Max and so yeah yeah this is indeed
a very good specific example like I ever
across some people it's almost like dead
hands you might have just folded if you
would have just bet quote quote normal
size because that basically these are

[1:37:46]
size because that basically these are
like guys that get very curious when you
polarize a lot maybe there's also spot
where you might have a lot of the ace
blockers or whatever and then basically
the bigger you go the more likely they
are to call this kind of the yeah kind
of the situation and even just snap
jamming I'm like trying to play the role

[1:38:01]
jamming I'm like trying to play the role
of like stupid bully like you know
easelder want type yeah like oh all
right oh I I have nothing Soldier is not
stupid let's let's just snap
you have no decision with whereas if you

[1:38:15]
you have no decision with whereas if you
maybe have the nuts you might have to
think about it a little a little more
right like what would be the good sizing
here uh maybe not go too big well when
you just have the Ace of Hearts uh
profile online kit he just shows you
exactly part of it because if you're
snap jamming it comes off as
premeditated and if he thinks my

[1:38:30]
premeditated and if he thinks my
premeditated orientation towards the
game is to just open to over Bluff like
some crazy person he's just gonna
and also like he he snap called back
like kind of to send a message to me I
think of like I'm not afraid of you
um but unfortunately just one level

[1:38:45]
um but unfortunately just one level
below I mean I love bird he's a great
great player but
many players who are listening to the
podcast are probably now uh
very motivated to start to deliberately
work on their game
often players already know what to work
on so two questions how should people go

[1:39:03]
on so two questions how should people go
about and how do you go about finding
your leaks and then
how would you best work on improving
those
okay so for individual people I know I

[1:39:17]
okay so for individual people I know I
have a very specific you know highly
regimented highly logical approach to
the game that works for me and it's a
routine and a style that I've cultivated
over years
it's not going to copy and paste to

[1:39:30]
it's not going to copy and paste to
everybody and you know I think there's
some people that are just very intuitive
that would not really want to sit down
and think that hard about all this
different stuff
um
or to do it in quite this way so that's
why in the beginning I'm really
emphasizing on finding coaches or study

[1:39:47]
emphasizing on finding coaches or study
material or whatever it's going to be
that really works for you
so if you're as long as you are putting
in some level of effort to try to
cultivate a routine I think that's the
most important part because this is
something that I've developed through

[1:40:01]
something that I've developed through
iterations that has worked for me
um finding my own leaks I I mean one of
my favorite tools is hand to note
um panasonode is a basically a tool that
can really comprehensively help you
review your database so I can

[1:40:16]
review your database so I can
essentially
import all the hands I played let's say
on like ACR and it gives you
some very detailed pop-up stats of all
the different basically the way you play
in every different situation so I have a

[1:40:30]
in every different situation so I have a
tab for like here's how I play in two
bed pot in position prefop razor so
let's say if I'm button versus big find
right and then here's for the turn on
here's on the river okay now what if I'm
calling out of the big blind okay two
bed pot out of position pre-flop caller
here's home defending against C bet and

[1:40:46]
here's home defending against C bet and
not just how I'm defending in C but here
is how I defend against a third pot half
pot three quarters over bet and next to
that stat you know let's say it's like
I'm folding versus one third see about
35 of the time or something I'll have po

[1:41:01]
35 of the time or something I'll have po
solvers number which I figured out or
that Pat figured out through doing
um multi-fop aggregation reports in po
so I can compare what I'm doing to what
possolver is doing and I can get a sense

[1:41:15]
possolver is doing and I can get a sense
of like okay at the bare minimum my
frequencies are basically correct here
and also have a strong sense of what um
the range compositions would be in each
of these so antonym can also help you
see like okay here's how often I'm check
raising a set or two pair or whatever

[1:41:30]
raising a set or two pair or whatever
and so you can get a sense of like okay
I'm relatively balanced in this area so
I'm playing well I don't need to study
this as hard but let's see let's say
like oh I'm overfolding versus the half
pot you know by like two percent or
something or three percent I mean even
for me any small amount is an error

[1:41:45]
for me any small amount is an error
that's intolerable right so it's like
okay
um I know maybe I'll write that down my
notebook over folding first half pot and
I'll set that intention when I'm going
into a session of like okay just
remember to you know kind of calibrate a
little bit with the versus the half pot
that's and so I basically have the

[1:42:01]
that's and so I basically have the
entire game tree sort of mapped out in
hand to note of like every basically
common situation how often I'm using
different sizings and comparing that to
solver
and how how well I'm defending against
bets across the entire game tree and I'm

[1:42:16]
bets across the entire game tree and I'm
constantly figuring out like if there's
a leak to plug I'm going to leak it or
if not going to plug it and focusing on
that um specifically so if I'm yeah
basically if I'm over folding or under
bluffing or under raising I try to get

[1:42:32]
bluffing or under raising I try to get
and to that as quickly as possible
um and start steering it in the right
direction
are they also maybe some situations
usually when I if I look at my own game
and I'm deviating

[1:42:45]
and I'm deviating
like or for example I I put it I put a
hand in in Wizards or something and it
says hey uh it might still be play I'm
like okay yes but like some deviations
are are on purpose right like the goal
is not net some it depends obviously the

[1:43:00]
is not net some it depends obviously the
level I mean you play 2550 against some
of the best in the world short-handed
then you better be very accurate
but yeah it doesn't necessarily mean
that if you deviate in a certain in a
certain note like basically it should
just raise your awareness but okay
you're deviating here do you have a good

[1:43:16]
you're deviating here do you have a good
reason for that
sure so you might have personal targets
you don't necessarily have to use po
solver as an example but you have a
target range of what you want to be in
each different Zone and trying to Aspire
to do that yeah maybe you're playing two

[1:43:31]
to do that yeah maybe you're playing two
GTO in a spot where you should be sure
more out of line for example I think
also I think we're touching that a
little bit previews in the podcast as
well but in terms of improving your
leaks uh like I'm sure I'm sure you've
seen monitors maybe you've done it

[1:43:45]
seen monitors maybe you've done it
yourself I've done it myself but it's
just like uh I don't know call River
call River fold River you ain't like
these notepads are telling you that you
should do something okay but sometimes
it doesn't really
work or most of that actually doesn't
really work you have to when you spot a

[1:44:00]
really work you have to when you spot a
link you have to find the origin of the
league so for example let's say you
overfold in a certain spot but that
might be because your range composition
on the previous street is not well done
so basically if you just say I should
call River more but every time you have
nothing on the river because the way you

[1:44:16]
nothing on the river because the way you
construct your rage just calling more
might actually not be not be very not be
a very good solution it's actually
it's actually a leak and a privilege
street that makes you fall the river
more that's exactly where the strategy

[1:44:30]
more that's exactly where the strategy
development comes in now and why I focus
on like okay here's how I'm going to
play a balanced range relatively
speaking on each street so I know it
pays off it just makes me so much harder
to play against in general because so
much of it winds up being sort of
premeditated in a way of like I play a

[1:44:47]
premeditated in a way of like I play a
good flop stab range so it just
extrapolates that's kind of harder to
play against me by the time you get to
the river like if I check back to turn
I'm gonna have uh just kind of a much
stronger range than if someone's not
protecting as much yeah so so basically

[1:45:01]
protecting as much yeah so so basically
in the report you see okay I'm deviating
here from Theory then you might open a
solver Luca derange let's say the whole
bets oh is it simply because I'm missing
the hands with these type of heuristics
as a call and like you said you go in
game most probably then if you're like I

[1:45:16]
game most probably then if you're like I
have that as well it's like oh I I know
I should call more so then there's like
a spot you feel like eh it's close oh
this is exactly one of the spots where I
clearly overfolding so my intuition says
it's close but actually I'm over folding
so I probably everything that's close I
should just move to call it's a

[1:45:30]
should just move to call it's a
relatively
easy spot to fix but yeah it becomes
harder when for example you're like you
go to this later Street you're like okay
so Pi will raise these hands colors and
they're like
wait but I don't have these hands you
have to be realistic with yourself as
well that I think it's very easy to just

[1:45:45]
well that I think it's very easy to just
be like oh yeah okay but forget the fact
that you you never have those hands in
the first place
yeah I think that's what makes so I do a
lot of I use the drill feature in GTO
wizard really often as well so if I see

[1:46:00]
wizard really often as well so if I see
okay like I'm over folding versus a half
pot seabed or whatever I have tons of
different drills with color-coded tags
that I go to uh pretty frequently and so
I'll just maybe I'll pull that up I'm
like okay I'm gonna go through 20 of
these and then

[1:46:15]
these and then
um just as a refresher and then like you
said like if you're in a spot where it
feels close
and you know that's like your leak it
can make sense to kind of defer towards
maybe calling if your leak is over
folding because you're basically
sort of calibrating for a bias that you

[1:46:31]
sort of calibrating for a bias that you
have because you might have a bias that
is weighted towards folding and you
adjust it by kind of overriding it a
little bit when you get that feeling
like okay this is really close
because if you were able to
uh into it what was truly close you

[1:46:46]
uh into it what was truly close you
wouldn't be over folding so your meter
is probably a little bit off in that
scenario yeah and basically by doing the
strategy creation you build better
intuition
so next time by the repetition your
intuition becomes more correct

[1:47:00]
intuition becomes more correct
it's just a ton of drilling but yeah
yeah it's on a ton of drilling do you
have like
because then what I sometimes would
struggle with like so I feel like it's I
feel like I know something then and then
I'll move on to a different point but if

[1:47:15]
I'll move on to a different point but if
I don't pay enough attention to the
other point it might it the league might
start to come back
let's say for example
to hold to hold back the water and at
some point a little hole comes out well

[1:47:30]
some point a little hole comes out well
you've identified the hole so you stick
your finger in it and they're like oh
you you know you put something on it and
you work on a different hole but if you
don't pay attention the other hole opens
up again but like
you were describing like I've kind of
accepted that you know will always exist

[1:47:46]
accepted that you know will always exist
yeah well yes I mean you are describing
essentially the Marquee problem of like
coaching small Stakes players first of
all like that's always going to be a
thing that would come up is trying to
play whack-a-mole with all these

[1:48:00]
play whack-a-mole with all these
different leaks I mean part of why I
study so goddamn hard is to minimize how
many uh leaks that I might have in my
game but it poker is so complicated that
of course you're never going to be
perfect there's always going to be
something that you have that's you know

[1:48:15]
something that you have that's you know
exploitable but that's why I value the
simplified strategies and try to
simplify things when possible and that
could you know I'd like to use as few
sizings as possible in any situation
um so that I can more reliably you know
get to the river while losing as little

[1:48:31]
get to the river while losing as little
Eevee as possible
Yeah so basically then your River
decisions become
or at least because your range is better
in Tech it's easier yes to play later
switch so how do you then I get this
question actually a lot then people have
various ideas about it

[1:48:46]
various ideas about it
so how do you then determine your bet
size scheme let's say for example you
open a part of the tree and there are
some situations where where I solve her
clearly where like the heuristics are
quite clear right you lean to a lot of

[1:49:00]
quite clear right you lean to a lot of
big bets you lean to a lot of small bets
but then there are some spots where it's
like it bats 20 one third twenty percent
three-quarters twenty percent over bet
now what do you do
are we talking about on the Flop uh this

[1:49:15]
are we talking about on the Flop uh this
happens flops sometimes on turn
definitely on the river so okay yeah I
was gonna say so how would that impact
for you flop turn River yeah so
something on the Flop I think this is
where coming up with the multi-flop
subset you know comes in where you can

[1:49:30]
subset you know comes in where you can
say okay here's the GTO Baseline if I
give po like 30 pot 50 75 125 what is
the EV for the in position C better and
then let's say all right on the specific
texture I'm going to let it either bet
half pot or check
and what is the EV how much did I

[1:49:46]
and what is the EV how much did I
actually lose by you know conceding that
complexity and what I found is a lot of
the time you don't like you don't lose
as much as you think you do
and so by
you know trying to simplify things of
maybe just having one size on a

[1:50:00]
maybe just having one size on a
particular texture on each flop now each
you might not just have one size period
it could be you know
yeah texture bit more texture one size
per texture yeah but you'll find that
it's a fra a lot of times a fraction of
a percentage of the pot and so this is

[1:50:17]
a percentage of the pot and so this is
something that can be really hard for a
lot of poker players to accept if they
want to accept it is that you know we
want to feel like we're super smart when
we're playing Pokemon like we're so like
I can do better than like a simple

[1:50:30]
I can do better than like a simple
protocol of like just bet your Bluffs
like half the time or 70 whatever you
know I'm smarter than that I know the
blockers I know the situation yada yada
most of the time simple protocols and
especially on early streets are just
going to outperform you know whatever

[1:50:45]
going to outperform you know whatever
Linus or whoever would really attempt to
do because you're more accurate right
um I think that yeah I mean ultimately
you don't even need to debate it it's
like that's the the benefit of it being
scientific is like you can just measure

[1:51:01]
scientific is like you can just measure
how much EV is lost and then if you want
to you can note block your own thing and
experiment like okay if I had four
sizings what how would I compose my
range and then you can see how much EV
did I really lose compared to GTO yeah
coming back to it I would build a range

[1:51:16]
coming back to it I would build a range
myself right and then you can even
another thing is that what you might do
in the quiet of your own room like or
you're so GTO but maybe when you're
actually playing you know you're too
busy using all your good hands for an

[1:51:30]
busy using all your good hands for an
over bet because you get excited because
you have a set and you might not you
know I know it's kind of silly but
basically and I mean you're describing
population as a whole right like it's
easier it's easy to scroll up a little
bit with a strong hand and not find the

[1:51:46]
bit with a strong hand and not find the
you know high card with the Unblocker
it's that that's a hand that's a bit
little bit less intuitive maybe I do
feel like
just pick a sizing and because in the
end like how you're going to execute

[1:52:00]
end like how you're going to execute
your strategy will actually determine
your review like you already said on the
Flop give it any any of the sizings as
long as you you know if you bet small
then by all means usually you bet a lot
if you bet bake them at least bet less
so the sizing is is linked with the
frequency but if you then execute that

[1:52:16]
frequency but if you then execute that
that the execution will always determine
your AV especially I think on the Flop
it doesn't really matter what you
changed in the software because if you
will not really change that much because
it's a solver so whatever you give it it
will execute perfectly on layer Street
and you might play the optimal sizing

[1:52:31]
and you might play the optimal sizing
but even on a later streak to screw up
that strategy will actually not be
optimal for you so that was floppy like
you said on earlier streets in general
probably you do them the same on turn
like you try to stick yeah

[1:52:45]
you know because usually if you get to
later you might need two sizings you
know it depends on the situation like as
things get more complicated you might
need to split more but I'd say just try
to trying to use as few sizings as you
can and simplify as much as possible

[1:53:02]
can and simplify as much as possible
um
and the other thing about just the Flop
is that
um you might have a certain
exploitability like let's say it's 0.3
percent of the Pod 0.4 percent of the
pot
that's also with po having Clairvoyance

[1:53:16]
that's also with po having Clairvoyance
over how you just constructed your range
but a real person doesn't know first of
all they don't know how you constructed
your range to begin with second of all
they don't know how to maximally exploit
It Anyway even if they knew what you
were doing
so in practice it's usually like this is

[1:53:31]
so in practice it's usually like this is
the worst case scenario is you lose this
percentage of the pot
um because that's the max exploit in in
reality it's going to be less than that
yeah and it's I mean there's there's a
lot of realizations that people need to
make like some things are very important

[1:53:45]
make like some things are very important
to a solver and also very important in
game we can use it and other things are
very important to solver because the
solver knows the other guys exactly the
range composition of the other guy right
so if you know we don't have a certain
hand at least 25 percent of the time and
the other guys knows that then when that

[1:54:00]
the other guys knows that then when that
hand is good then you don't have it
you're a bit [ __ ] in terms of eev Rise
right but in practice like you said
people cannot see your exact range
composition so you know it might be okay
to always play a certain hand in a
certain way and never have that hand in
another line because people

[1:54:16]
another line because people
they might not know obviously you know
if you do that to to to high of an
extent and you just pick strong hands to
better weak as you check we have a
problem but within the weekends you know
you could maybe have a preference for
always checking one or else with

[1:54:30]
always checking one or else with
whatever I'm doing it's so it's going to
be pretty close to what GTO would be
because it's not that exploitable even
by Piero solver
yeah exactly so what would you then
so for example take check all check bet
line sure as big blind I think is a a

[1:54:46]
line sure as big blind I think is a a
common spot where you know you at least
split but that's the river and there
you're fine with with starting to split
and add some yeah I mean maybe someone
that's a
freaky Genie maybe I'll put Pat on this
one I don't know of like how you could

[1:55:00]
one I don't know of like how you could
simplify the river but I mean it's
pretty complicated but one thing that I
um had done that I thought was pretty
useful is basically doing my best to try
to get the default frequencies for the
river as well so it's kind of the same

[1:55:16]
river as well so it's kind of the same
process even though it just takes a
really long time is doing a multi-flop
subset for what your riverfold
frequencies would be in different lines
it just takes a really long time for to
figure it out because it has to go
through every permutation of plop and
turn but I just kind of leave my

[1:55:31]
turn but I just kind of leave my
computer on like all night or whatever
and kind of get one size at a time and
so I can see how often PO is betting the
river and also how much it folds to each
specific bet size and hand to note I

[1:55:45]
specific bet size and hand to note I
have that figured out like Okay
um
it's it's pretty convenient where I can
see okay I'm betting you know small X
percent of the time here's what po does
you know medium size here's po big size
you know here's po you know big over bet
po

[1:56:00]
po
um and then I can also you can tap into
it and see like what's your range
composition like how frequently are you
bluffing and you can see like oh am I
preferring you know am I not bluffing
enough for the small size am I not
bluffing enough for the big size and it

[1:56:15]
bluffing enough for the big size and it
gives you an objective way to try to
measure your biases
um through looking at your database over
a long enough period of time and then
it's going to be the same thing with
facing a riverbed where I can see like
okay do I fold too much of small bats am
I too am I folding too much to over bets

[1:56:30]
I too am I folding too much to over bets
no you might say like you might have a
read that maybe you think people over
they don't Bluff enough or over bets
then okay maybe you're aiming to fold
more than po but the point is that you
have to have a Target yeah yeah and the
target can be either po because you
don't have other information so you just

[1:56:46]
don't have other information so you just
want to play solid or when you have
other information you want to maybe
reach a higher full percentage Empire
right
you also have some coaching experience
yourself what are the most common leaks
you see that players have and why do you

[1:57:00]
you see that players have and why do you
think that is
foreign well I think playing too passive
tends to be a big one
um
and it's something that basically gets
revealed to people all the different
ways that they might be making mistakes

[1:57:15]
ways that they might be making mistakes
through you know
basically doing this stat Checker that
Pat developed in hantonoke
um and once you can I think it just
helps once you can see from beginning to
end this is the way that you play the
game you see a lot of themes and people

[1:57:31]
game you see a lot of themes and people
just kind of playing too safe overall
um and so part of getting people to play
Closer to You Know GTO or whatever is
usually getting them to be more
aggressive so a lot of the time I'd say
the basic General bias that

[1:57:46]
the basic General bias that
theoretically oriented players have is
that they are more passive than po
solver
um not intentionally
just that if you're playing poker the
right way you have to basically
you have to play like a madman which is

[1:58:00]
you have to play like a madman which is
really it's really really hard to do
that day after week after month and even
with players that we're pointing this
out specifically like this is how you
play
closer to a GTO strategy
we just have something called passive
drift where like a lot of the time they

[1:58:15]
drift where like a lot of the time they
hit a downswing and then all of a sudden
every mixed strategy becomes at fold to
them or they just are passing up on
Bluffs where I'm like this is clearly
like a nut fluff candidate and you're
not like I'm going through a review and
they don't do it and there's usually
some like justification

[1:58:31]
some like justification
and I think it's just that poker puts a
lot of pressure on you it's a really
tough game and once you're on a big
downswing
um it's funny how that sort of passive
drift just kind of seeps in and so for
me in my own game that's why it's so
important for me to really focus on

[1:58:46]
important for me to really focus on
process and studying really intensely
I'm always reviewing what I'm doing in
hand to note to make sure that I'm not
drifting in that direction either
yeah passive tilt definitely I can
relate to that if I if I'm if I'm if I'm

[1:59:00]
relate to that if I if I'm if I'm if I'm
less confident or if I'm a bit of a
downswing passive tilt is usually where
I'll lean towards I'll play tighter I'll
play more nitty I'll find a reason not
to get not to Bluff catch off on a
reason why to give up I think it's very
important to

[1:59:15]
important to
uh yeah kind of again be self-aware and
kind of check in with yourself uh when
that is actually going on
any any solutions on how to fix this
yeah I think if you wait until it's

[1:59:31]
yeah I think if you wait until it's
already happening it's probably too late
that's why I focus so much in the
process of like you got to just assume
that this is going to happen if you're
not on top of it because I've just seen
it happen over and over and over again
did you have the same struggles and if
so how did you overcame it uh no because

[1:59:46]
so how did you overcame it uh no because
I was three betting thirty percent at
two fives
naturally yeah
man I mean yeah it's like I'm not a
gambler but I just um I don't know
um
really just sort of devoted to playing

[2:00:00]
really just sort of devoted to playing
the game in a pretty hardcore way where
just like I'm I mean I'm just willing to
look like a [ __ ] and just like make
some terrible Bluff and like make it 10
big blind mistake or to make a big
mistake on a you know River call because
I'd rather just I can't sometimes I'll

[2:00:15]
I'd rather just I can't sometimes I'll
just tell myself if you're gonna live by
this word you're gonna die by the sword
like playing this game the right way is
pretty volatile that's uh that's that's
Amen to that I think you also mentioned
that
I think I read that you know block you
mentioned that a lot of players they

[2:00:30]
mentioned that a lot of players they
play the game not to lose instead of
playing to win it's kind of also what
you mentioned with passive like too much
passive Behavior
yeah it just comes to a natural human
bias of being risk-averse I mean we just
don't really like risk that much and so

[2:00:45]
don't really like risk that much and so
it's easier to kind of coil up and play
it safe I think part of the problem with
playing a super crazy strategy sort of
like what I was not like super crazy
strategy but you know being willing to
take some big risks is that you risk
making a big mistake there's no like
there's I'll just give you like a random

[2:01:01]
there's I'll just give you like a random
example of like if you let's say you see
bet the Flop as in position for like
one-third and then you bet the term for
three quarters right kind of a pretty
standard sequence
on the river po solver is gonna like bet
500 pot like you know maybe double

[2:01:17]
500 pot like you know maybe double
digits like Po does not give a [ __ ] it
will just 5x pot okay
the the problem with this is like when
you're actually sitting there in the
game
and let's say you just have some random

[2:01:30]
and let's say you just have some random
Bluff and you're really gonna 500 pot
what if that's like a 10 big line
mistake it it might be it might be
higher EV but for for for the brain it's
just like you're risking you're risking
a lot you're like well let's let's just
bet three quarters again let's bet on it

[2:01:46]
bet three quarters again let's bet on it
that will probably get the job done
that's probably what the passive bias
will will tell you
it's not only that that's a part of it
where you're just risking less if you
lose but it's also you're less likely to
make a mistake because as you choose

[2:02:00]
make a mistake because as you choose
bigger and bigger sizings and you get
more and more polarized you get po tends
to narrow things down to more specific
Combos and so it gets harder and harder
to just intuitively guess what the
Perfect combo is in this situation
so what you're risking is guessing wrong

[2:02:17]
so what you're risking is guessing wrong
and making a big mistake and this is
going to extrapolate to lots of
different situations in poker like let's
say you're facing a Big River Bluff
catch decision with a really marginal
block catcher
but you know you maybe you could Bluff

[2:02:32]
but you know you maybe you could Bluff
catch with this you're gonna you might
have to take a risk and risk make
because there's been plenty of times
where I call a river in some situation
that seems close and it winds up being a
big mistake but I'm doing it for this

[2:02:45]
big mistake but I'm doing it for this
more ideological purpose of like I'm
just go this is the way that I play the
game I you know live by the sword die by
the sword or that you're like I'm just
going to
have this hardcore strategy where I just
don't give a [ __ ]
um and globally that makes you insanely

[2:03:00]
um and globally that makes you insanely
hard to play against
um because to play poker properly you
just wind up not folding that much
because the alternative is you just play
it safe
and you just fold in more of these
closer situations but what you'll find

[2:03:15]
closer situations but what you'll find
is when you look at your stats at the
end of the month or the end of the year
you might just be over folding by a lot
and so
part of what makes Poker beautiful and
unsolvable and all this stuff is that
there is no way to play GTO it is too

[2:03:30]
there is no way to play GTO it is too
there's no way for a human being to
avoid playing GTO and like not make any
10 big buying mistakes because it's too
complicated
so you kind of have to choose your
perspective on the game if you're going
to be this I mean I'm kind of like an
edge Lord playing poker like I just

[2:03:46]
edge Lord playing poker like I just
wanted I'm the type of person that's
going to take the BET three bet four bet
spot on the Flop or whatever just
because I that's just the attitude that
I'm going to approach the game from for
some people they might never three bad
they may have might have zero flop three
bet range because that is safer

[2:04:01]
bet range because that is safer
and they make fewer mistakes generally
speaking and I think there's a ton of
Merit to it there's a ton of players
that play that way and win a ton of
money but that's just not the way that
really works for me
so it's basically being okay with being
absolutely wrong sometimes

[2:04:16]
absolutely wrong sometimes
oh yeah that's probably maybe that's the
most important thing I should impart is
I'm mainly entirely wrong when I'm
playing poker and yet somehow you know I
might end up in the green but the
experience of it feels like always being
wrong and always kind of being this Edge

[2:04:31]
wrong and always kind of being this Edge
Lord
you would
that would give you
let's say a break even Huntington now
player and you will get three coaching
sessions what would the topics of these
three coaching sessions be

[2:04:47]
well I'd really want to take a look at
their database and be able to see what
are they actually doing because you know
I want to treat people as individuals
when I started when we started this
podcast I I think I said you know like

[2:05:00]
podcast I I think I said you know like
if you're going to be a poker coach you
need to take what you're doing seriously
you can't just you know throw some [ __ ]
at the wall and I mean people are
trusting you with their career you
should take this seriously and so
treating someone as an individual and
saying okay so what are they actually
doing what are their biases what are

[2:05:15]
doing what are their biases what are
their mistakes and all this work that
I've done and that Pat has done even
though I'm not really coaching anymore
um I think I would just start by really
breaking down their database and seeing
what is their overall perspective on the
game

[2:05:31]
game
um and kind of having this comprehensive
quantifiable Benchmark is really the
best place to start
I I don't know I think Pat actually
has like examples of him doing stat
checks with people I mean don't quote me
on that but I think it's on his YouTube
channel

[2:05:47]
you've done your homework so
um that would probably be the place that
I would always want to start with people
is to figure out what exactly are they
doing and of course that's ultimately
going to give me you know

[2:06:00]
going to give me you know
the starting place to figure out what
type of advice to give them
Yeah so basically the other coaching
sessions will depend on what rolls out
of the first go-to session which would
be
reviewing their game and seeing where

[2:06:15]
reviewing their game and seeing where
they apparently have
flawed ways of approaching poker
yeah exactly and you'll tend to find
overall trends for People based off of
these stat checks
how do you then prioritize what to work

[2:06:31]
how do you then prioritize what to work
on with the students or with yourself
when you find leaks especially you know
the lower you go the more leaks people
have so how do I then decide what is
most important well
I mean I'll I'll just speak for myself

[2:06:46]
I mean I'll I'll just speak for myself
in that of course there's going to be
some level of it that will be intuitive
if you're a pro but one thing that I did
that I found pretty helpful was I kind
of just did this experiment where I went
in hand to note and saw how often was I

[2:07:00]
in hand to note and saw how often was I
in each different situation so as an
example how often how many times was I
you know big blind versus Button as a
potential see better
how often was I you know facing a flopsy
bet as big blind out of position and so

[2:07:15]
bet as big blind out of position and so
I had the number of times that that
happened and then I estimated the Flop
where I estimated the pot size of each
different situation so maybe if it's you
know if I opened a 2.5 x on the button
and the big one calls it's a 5.5 big
blind pot okay so I can multiply that by

[2:07:30]
blind pot okay so I can multiply that by
the frequency of times I was in that
situation and I can basically all of
this is coming I can get to my big blind
volume which is how many big blinds are
invested in each individual spot
and it's kind of a way of quantifying

[2:07:45]
and it's kind of a way of quantifying
that you know not every situation is
equal there's some situations that are a
lot more esoteric that they're important
in their own ways but they have a lot
less impact on your game
so when I was coming up with a white GTO
wizard drills do I want to create for

[2:08:00]
wizard drills do I want to create for
myself to help me improve my game I
prioritized it based off of which spots
had the highest big blind volume I did
this for the Flop I did it for the turn
and I did it for the river
um both for bluffing the river and Bluff
catching the river
and there's a certain amount of

[2:08:15]
and there's a certain amount of
estimation because you're estimating the
average pot size but it gives you a good
sense of what you should study so when I
know I'm thinking about like when I
study the river you know these are the
places that I would start are the
highest impact situations where you know
if you're studying check raise check

[2:08:31]
if you're studying check raise check
raise you know check raise I mean that
would be the least likely thing to
happen it's fancy and it's sophisticated
you know it's there's levels to it that
could be interesting but it might not be
the most impactful thing for your game
so I'm really I spent time kind of

[2:08:46]
so I'm really I spent time kind of
sorting for impact for myself
yeah so and the impact is the formula of
frequency and big blinds because like
pre-flop for example is going to be the
most frequent right if we look at sure
but then river is less frequent probably

[2:09:00]
but then river is less frequent probably
the least frequent but there Nepal is
the biggest so it has to be it has to be
a formula of the two
yeah there's different things you could
say like there might be different levels
of complexity to different decisions
kind of subjected but like pre-flop

[2:09:15]
kind of subjected but like pre-flop
would be the easiest where like you kind
of could just have a baked in range for
100 big blinds and already know what it
would be so also indeed like in terms of
if you think about what the work on
what's the hardest spot what's the
easiest spot to work on so if you have a
high frequency spot

[2:09:30]
high frequency spot
that's easy easy to fix probably you
know already a good place to to start
with those and then the other things
become a little bit uh more complicated
depending on how easy it is to solve
them
yeah exactly I mean I the way that I

[2:09:45]
yeah exactly I mean I the way that I
mean overall I would just if I had
nothing else to go on I would just focus
on which spots are the biggest pots that
are happening the most often and then
prioritizing my time towards that
because obviously poker is so big and so
complicated you could get lost in the
weeds if you really don't know what to

[2:10:00]
weeds if you really don't know what to
study so that's I know it's not perfect
but this was a way that helped me try to
Target a bit more and then when I have
my stat Checker that looks at all the
stats I can see like I'm not going to
study something if I see him doing it
well right now maybe I can come back and

[2:10:16]
well right now maybe I can come back and
review it later but if I can see like
okay I'm making a mistake here I know to
run a drill on that specifically and
what about like in intuitively in terms
of you feel like let's say for example
there's a spot that might Luma database

[2:10:30]
there's a spot that might Luma database
but looks it looks like it's fine
but intuitively I find myself not really
comfortable about the spot like there's
also a certain feeling aspect to it
right which can so basically if someone
has a lot of leaks probably intuitively
when they're in the spot they have no

[2:10:45]
when they're in the spot they have no
clue what to do right so I think
just playing and figuring out like hey I
actually have no clue what to do in this
spot it's probably also already a decent
indicator for you know
if they're actually yeah
um
I wanted to I wanted to ask

[2:11:02]
I wanted to I wanted to ask
one more oh yeah so then so then
basically so
you've you've analyzed your game you
found the leaks then you're going to
strategy creation right you come up with
a better strategy than before you play
you might review all the points you set
your intention okay this session I'm

[2:11:15]
your intention okay this session I'm
going to improve in these points you
play your session afterwards you review
those hints and then basically it's
repeats in your case 10 days straight
then take a little break and then uh two
years later you're s5k that's that's
yeah it's pretty easy it's kind of the
this guy is the conclusion I have one

[2:11:31]
this guy is the conclusion I have one
last question before I hand it over to
Adam uh what is an often overlooked way
to increase your AV as a poker player
wow hmm

[2:11:45]
wow hmm
I mean I don't know if there's really
any easy way to do it though I mean I
feel like everything that I said that I
think would actually be high impacted
people
it just takes a lot of work I don't
think there's going to be anything I
don't think there's any Secret
tips it just requires like an insane

[2:12:01]
tips it just requires like an insane
amount of work and if you're someone
like me being very organized at the very
least an insane amount of work
that makes sense for example you did
mention that you know you like to play
night times for example in the US
because that's simply when there is the

[2:12:15]
because that's simply when there is the
best action so for example when I think
about something that's often overlooked
is something like maybe planning your
grind hours around when you're when the
games are best for example
yeah we're living we're having access at

[2:12:30]
yeah we're living we're having access at
least to you know some games in the US
because uh we you know some people have
a lot of money and they like to gamble
here so uh having access to American
Games is is good
um so I I will agree with that

[2:12:45]
hi guys Renee aka the weko here with a
quick mechanics of Poker 2.0
announcement in our program you'll get
access to 80 plus hours of content in
which we will explain you all aspects
needed in order to become a more
successful poker player now one of these

[2:13:01]
successful poker player now one of these
of course is the technical aspect of the
game in which I'll be explaining you all
the mechanics behind poker strategies
we'll be talking about GTO exploitive
play with an extra focus on the why
behind certain strategies and why the

[2:13:15]
behind certain strategies and why the
population has certain leaks and to
increase your win rate even further
we've recently added a River Bluff and
Bluff catching section so you can
increase your in V when those pots
become very big our mindset and
performance coach Adam Carmichael he
took care of the mental game and

[2:13:31]
took care of the mental game and
performance section of this program in
which he will teach you everything you
need to know in order to break through
limiting beliefs better handle your
emotions break free from tilt and play
your A game more consistently lead and

[2:13:46]
your A game more consistently lead and
last but not least we've added the
management and optimization section in
the program in which we will give you
various tips and tricks to make it more
likely for your poker career to succeed
and how to continuously improve as a

[2:14:00]
and how to continuously improve as a

concept is continuously evolving based
on feedback and suggestions we get from
our community next to all this content
you will have access to our exclusive
Discord Community monthly live q a calls

[2:14:15]
Discord Community monthly live q a calls
and one-on-one coaching session in which
we are going to be reviewing if you have
been implementing the stuff that we
teach you in the mechanics of Poker
correctly so do you think you have what
it takes to master the mechanics of
Poker go over to mechanics of poker.com

[2:14:31]
Poker go over to mechanics of poker.com
and maybe you will get a chance to work
with me and Adam and make more progress
in your poker career but for now without
further Ado let's get back into more
goodness in today's episode

[2:14:45]
goodness in today's episode
Adam your more specialized mental game
performance mindset what do you think is
an often overlooked way that people
could increase their AV that they don't
spend enough time on
it's a good question I think if it was
obvious players wouldn't have overlooked
it I think as mats has kind of covered

[2:15:01]
it I think as mats has kind of covered
it's kind of doing the deeper work so if
I could see a one area it's probably uh
spending more time to plan and go deep
so if you look at math for example he
spent a lot of time looking at what
spots he should be working on he's
probably got a whole learning curriculum

[2:15:15]
probably got a whole learning curriculum
of how we should be studying for the
next months and Beyond whereas I think
most players will just rock up the
computer look at some hand histories
start working on spots and have another
planning so the overlooked part would be
the planning the plan ahead to where you
want to be as a poker player a year from
now two years from now in creating kind

[2:15:31]
now two years from now in creating kind
of your own learning curriculum I'd say
that would be yeah probably an
overlooked part but like I said if it's
if it was so obvious players on silly
players are clever guys so we'll figure
it out if it wasn't um it was super
obvious
all right I want to spend the time to
reflecting and looking back on your

[2:15:45]
reflecting and looking back on your
career so from this conversation I've
kind of wrote down a few times that you
have somewhat of a Fearless approach to
risk taking especially as it relates to
uh moving up stakes and implementing
aggressive strategies
why do you think so many players

[2:16:00]
why do you think so many players
struggle with taking risks
well I think one thing is just a basic
cognitive bias a risk aversion which is
that losing feels worse than winning
feels good so just naturally based off
the Neuroscience you're going to avoid

[2:16:15]
the Neuroscience you're going to avoid
taking risks because it just hurts more
um
and so
it just informs a lot of the way that
people play the game not just their
strategy but it could also be something
like bankroll management I mean it's not

[2:16:30]
like bankroll management I mean it's not
uncommon to hear about people that are
just playing at 200 Zoom forever even if
they're winning a substantial amount
they just don't want to move up in
Stakes unless they have like 500 buy-ins
or something I don't know
um probably not the best way to make
money unfortunately

[2:16:45]
money unfortunately
why does that not apply to you why do
you feel like you haven't struggled with
that
um
well I mean it could be just like even
going through poker detox in the

[2:17:01]
going through poker detox in the
beginning I think that there was a lot
of emphasis on playing poker in an
aggressive way
um so kind of the tribe that I came in
with definitely had a more aggressive
inclination which you know I have talked
extensively about how important that is

[2:17:17]
extensively about how important that is
um and I think a lot of it I just I
still I would guess would have as much
risk aversion or fear as anyone maybe a
little less I don't know less than the
average person for sure but I think I'm
just so committed to playing poker in

[2:17:31]
just so committed to playing poker in
the way that I feel is the right way and
in being a professional that I just will
not compromise on it regardless of how I
feel about it so I think probably the
most
um important part of it is that I'm just

[2:17:45]
um important part of it is that I'm just
really really dedicated to playing poker
at the highest level that I know how
when you risks back by FAU for example
when you were shot taken it wasn't
working out how do you recalibrate in
those moments so for example obviously
you're going to use data for coming back

[2:18:00]
you're going to use data for coming back
at you from results that you're getting
in life and you're going to make some
sort of calibration in terms of am I
going down the right path am I being
Reckless here or is this the right path
that I'm taking on the right amount of
risk even though the rewards aren't
there when times get tough for you how
do you recalibrate and step back into

[2:18:16]
do you recalibrate and step back into
risks I think it's these moments where a
lot of players over emphasize where
things are going badly and they'll step
away from risk because like whoa I don't
want to take on too much because things
might go badly so in those moments how
do you find a way to find that balance

[2:18:30]
do you find a way to find that balance
with risk taken
sure I mean if I get to a point where
I'm really overloaded I will take some
time away I don't want to you know
convey the people that they should do
like some dangerous level of risk taking
like there's a reason that we have fear

[2:18:47]
like there's a reason that we have fear
right I mean if you didn't have fear you
had gotten eaten by a lion and you know
back in the day so there's fear is
adaptive but I I think the point is that
you shouldn't be letting fear ultimately

[2:19:00]
you shouldn't be letting fear ultimately
control you
so for me
um
I'll give myself some time you know if
you need to feel sad you're going to
have to feel sad about it poker can be
sad as I've said many times there's a
lot of suffering involved with playing
this game
but it's always going to come back to

[2:19:16]
but it's always going to come back to
the North Star what am I trying to do
what am I you know what am I trying to
become and when playing this game I'll
remind myself like hey losing is a part
of the process losing is the process I
mean this game is sadistic you're just
mainly losing so uh it's just less

[2:19:32]
mainly losing so uh it's just less
shocking over time like yeah I'm gonna
lose I know I'm gonna go in another 100
000 downswing next week for all I know I
mean that's just that's just how the
game goes and it just takes this thing
out of it when I when I prepare myself

[2:19:45]
out of it when I when I prepare myself
for it and focus on
um kind of just what my North Star is
and what I'm trying to accomplish for me
it's being the number one player in
online six Max
um regardless of whether or not that
actually happens which it most likely
almost certainly will not

[2:20:02]
almost certainly will not
um
that doesn't that's not so important
it's more about the way that I am
carrying myself and my career the way
that I treat it
um I take a lot of pride in that
um you mentioned that when you first
joined detox you wrote in your blog that

[2:20:15]
joined detox you wrote in your blog that
you were going to be the biggest winning
player in their stable it reminds me of
the uh Muhammad Ali Court where he says
I taught the world I was gonna be the
greatest before I even knew I was going
to be so for you where did you get this
conference from this is a level of
innate trust in yourself to find out
answers I'm guessing this moment you

[2:20:31]
answers I'm guessing this moment you
didn't exactly know the path to be in
the best winner of detox what give you
that confidence going in that you could
achieve that
I just I don't know I guess I just saw
it as necessary to have that sort of

[2:20:45]
it as necessary to have that sort of
self belief and to lean into it it's
hard to say to what extent or could
these things be partially genetic I mean
I know I'm a very competitive person so
if you weren't really competitive you
might not be so driven to quite think
that way but

[2:21:00]
that way but
um
I I guess I just saw it as sort of this
just kind of necessary to have this sort
of belief in myself in order to be able
to Aspire to
I don't know do these great things and I
found a lot of personal meaning in it

[2:21:15]
found a lot of personal meaning in it
and how did you back that up with like
kind of practical actions is it the work
ethic that you feel like you can outwork
everyone else is it the uh kind of
deliberate practice that you feel like
you were going to do that other players
weren't what give you the confidence
that in in practice day to day I'm going

[2:21:30]
that in in practice day to day I'm going
to outperform everyone around me because
I'm going to do something different
well to some extent you have to have
faith to start off because if you're I
mean I had just applied to the program
when I'm saying this so I didn't even
have a sense of who was there or how
good they were I just assumed that if

[2:21:45]
good they were I just assumed that if
I'm going to do something I want to be
great at it and to give my all to it so
of course implied in that is I'm going
to work like crazy and I knew that I
would work harder than everyone
and I basically did
um but you don't really get to that sort

[2:22:02]
um but you don't really get to that sort
of Extreme Action unless you have a
pretty uh extreme belief to begin with
and so it makes it a bit easier when you
have that sort of Extreme Action or
extreme belief that leads to the extreme
action and you get the big results which

[2:22:15]
action and you get the big results which
reinforces the belief I think what a lot
of people will do if they're not winning
in poker in particular is they'll say I
will be you know I would I know I'm not
confident but I just need to win first
like once I start winning then I'll be
confident but as I said poker is a game

[2:22:31]
confident but as I said poker is a game
mainly of losing you probably never get
this is you kind of have to start with
believing in yourself and then
everything else is going to follow from
that
um I don't unfortunately I don't have a
magic formula for how to just
automatically believe in yourself that I
think kind of comes from all these

[2:22:46]
think kind of comes from all these
different things that I've talked about
um at the very least starting small I
mean believing if you just have chronic
um
self-confidence issues could probably I
mean just simply starting small and but
it seems like a necessary part of the
process I mean I love Muhammad Ali so I

[2:23:02]
process I mean I love Muhammad Ali so I
definitely resonate uh with with his
sort of attitude makes perfect sense to
me
I was going to ask you how do you
instill belief which as you touched on
is a hard thing to uh kind of direct
people with but a lot of people watching

[2:23:15]
people with but a lot of people watching
this will be like all right well let's
say the average profile of a poker
player somewhat young likes gaming has
come from a schooling system maybe
didn't go on the educational path maybe
they did to some degree but they didn't
see a future academically they haven't
maybe had career successes or anything

[2:23:30]
maybe had career successes or anything
big in their life that's really held on
to unless it was early sports or early
gaming where they've had success so then
they come into poker kind of with a bit
of a chip on the shoulder I'm gonna go
down a different path to everyone else
and I'm gonna show people around me I'm
smart
it's quite difficult sometimes to
cultivate a belief in this Avenue when

[2:23:46]
cultivate a belief in this Avenue when
you don't have any kind of thing results
to back it up so I think what you've
what we've seen with you is you had this
belief going in so for you it may be
difficult to uh extrapolate if you
didn't have the belief because you had
it going in but I do think something's
important what you mentioned when you do
lack confidence and don't have belief
taking small steps and it's almost like

[2:24:01]
taking small steps and it's almost like
keeping the words that you make with
yourself you say you're going to go to
the gym five times a week you go five
times a week you say you get up at 6 a.m
you get up at 6am 7 Days in a way raw
and all of a sudden you start to realize
I can say things to myself I can make
these small promises and I can back that
up you then stretch it a little bit

[2:24:15]
up you then stretch it a little bit
further and go out can I do this next
thing you start showing yourself with
little things small daily wins that I
can do things I say I'm going to do over
time you build confidence for yourself
and then obviously for your goal was
massive in terms of the belief there but
I thinking for other players who might
not have that or Russian belief maybe

[2:24:30]
not have that or Russian belief maybe
start with small steps could be a
gateway
yeah you build credibility with yourself
when you do those things and you can
also think about how you're going to
frame it I mean you maybe you don't have
confidence that you're going to be the
best poker player ever because you don't
have results but you can have confidence

[2:24:45]
have results but you can have confidence
in that you're not going to give up
you know you can have confidence that
I'm going to try my best I mean these
things can sound kind of silly but it's
important because you have control over
them and they can there's just as
meaningful like it can be in a lot of
ways more inspiring to say like while I

[2:25:01]
ways more inspiring to say like while I
might I can't say it I'm going to be the
best poker player but I can say that I'm
not going to give up
um yeah it reminds me like the Rocky
movies for me like the inspiring stuff
about it wasn't that he kept winning it
was that he just kept getting up he got
hit so many times so hard I'm like he's
up again it was like a wind that just

[2:25:15]
up again it was like a wind that just
some crawled off the floor see I think
sometimes cultivating in ourselves the
ability to be resilient I've got
resilience to come back from hard times
and to keep showing up over and over I
think we often underestimate how big of
a skill that is to show up consistently
when other people would quit so yeah if
you've got nothing else to hold on to be

[2:25:30]
you've got nothing else to hold on to be
the guy who does a Rocky and dragged
himself up the floor again and again so
for you we've obviously had a very
successful career a lot to look back on
which you could class as high points for
you what is the most the thing you're
most proud of if you look back on your
career
so far yeah

[2:25:45]
so far yeah
um I think hitting a million dollars in
profit on ignition poker specifically
was pretty significant even though I
think at that point I'd already won a
million dollars overall playing poker it
was just seeing it all in one graph at
one time and just being like I mean holy
[ __ ] it's a million dollars this is

[2:26:01]
[ __ ] it's a million dollars this is
crazy
um I don't even think it needs further
explanation it was just kind of a really
significant thing
um the only other thing I would say
beyond that too is just finding pretty
significant success especially over the

[2:26:15]
significant success especially over the
past year playing on America's card room
because with ignition poker it sort of
has a reputation for being a bit softer
and it's a maximum of 10 20. where for
me playing on ACR and playing Heads Up
Against All the Poker gods of 2550 and

[2:26:31]
Against All the Poker gods of 2550 and
winning and so far and being able to
play like even just being able to play
100 200. I think actually I was playing
yeah I think I was playing there last
night actually and it's always kind of
like a surreal thing because I

[2:26:45]
like a surreal thing because I
remembered even before I was playing
poker I think I would have been like in
high school like look like maybe play
money or something
and I think I was probably like I saw
the Jamie gold stuff in the main event
like on ESPN and it was like looking on
poker stars with like Daniel I think

[2:27:01]
poker stars with like Daniel I think
this was when Daniel negranu was playing
100 200 and he had this like personal
like Vendetta like he's gonna play
against all these online kids this was
in like 2010 to like prove that he still
has it
um and but I just remember like opening
up Poker Stars this must have been

[2:27:16]
up Poker Stars this must have been
before Black Friday because I could open
up poker stars or whatever and I'm like
watching the lobbies and just watching
the ground you play 100 200 and there's
all the people there's mostly 47 and
like Susie Smith and Ultra maltes and
all these like old school people that I
don't even know what the hell they're
doing anymore

[2:27:31]
doing anymore
um but to me in my mind like wow that
that's nosebleeds like that is I can't
even imagine sitting down for you know
twenty thousand dollars
and being in that position now is
something where you know it's just kind
of surreal I guess yeah I think as well

[2:27:47]
of surreal I guess yeah I think as well
sometimes we don't take the time to uh
stop and look back and reflect how far
we've come I'm sure for you you've just
been in the trenches day after day and
just step by step you've got to where
you are and yeah I think it's really
good just to go out five years ago six
years ago this was a pipe dream I would

[2:28:00]
years ago this was a pipe dream I would
have been amazed that this is possible
so yeah somebody's as good just to hear
that moment be proud of yourself for the
journey you've come there's still about
to be done there's new goals to achieve
yeah that's kind of just moment to uh
acknowledge where you're where you're at
you've been doing this podcast there's a
bit of that for me too if Jessica will
just mark this moment in time here of

[2:28:15]
just mark this moment in time here of
something that I've done
yeah perfect yeah we want this to be a
Showcase of your career and also share
with the audience your journey so glad
it's been a fitting moment so for you
what would you say is the most important
lesson poke has taught you I know you've
been learning reflecting you've

[2:28:31]
been learning reflecting you've
obviously that's a very high point is
there any anything that sticks out as a
most important lesson
well I mean just
I just I don't know just internalizing
how hard that this has been I mean it's

[2:28:45]
how hard that this has been I mean it's
kind of funny when I juxtapose you know
a certain level of success that I've
enjoyed but the experience of it is
so difficult I mean I think the analogy
or the metaphor they used of Rocky
pretty significant I mean I'm from
Philadelphia so that's where that movie

[2:29:01]
Philadelphia so that's where that movie
took place there's this [ __ ] Rocky
statue out there I'm like he's a
fictional character but he has a statue
but that's the significance I mean he
resonated with people because it's like
yeah this is it you're just getting this
[ __ ] beat out of you day after day after

[2:29:15]
[ __ ] beat out of you day after day after
day
um but you just have to Contin keep
going and I guess it's just kind of it's
not like a a lesson that you get taught
in one day it's just something that you
learn through experience and iteration
of just how important perseverance is

[2:29:32]
of just how important perseverance is
you know passion and perseverance being
grit and all that so the lesson is to
continue continually put effort in when
things are getting tough to place the
Via in the face of hollow trips and at
the end of that amazing things that

[2:29:46]
the end of that amazing things that
happen I think that's kind of the
because I think wheel yeah hopefully
yeah because if you just persevere just
the person yeah you're a pretty sick
individual hopefully there's something
at the end of that pathway it's like it
was worth it it was worth that effort
and I think we've talked about grit
already in terms of the ability to have

[2:30:01]
already in terms of the ability to have
passion and perseverance but it's always
towards an outcome an objective that
you're trying to get to you might never
get there let me be striving but it's
the pursuit of a goal that is worth that
extra actually you're putting in
all right found a question from me is
what is your definition of success and

[2:30:17]
what is your definition of success and
has that changed as you've achieved more
success in your poker career
yeah well I mean I feel like my
definition of what is a lot of money has
changed since I've now that I'm married
and living in Los Angeles it's like oh
okay so that's uh that's upgraded over

[2:30:32]
okay so that's uh that's upgraded over
time
um but for me I think just the success
of my poker career at the very least is
kind of living at my at my stretch point
of always trying to
progress as far as I can I mentioned the

[2:30:46]
progress as far as I can I mentioned the
whole Michael Jordan of online poker
thing that's sort of like a fun goal or
whatever but it's not really about
whether or not I do that especially
because it's so unlikely to happen it's
more about like am I living as if I'm
doing that and at the very least if I'm

[2:31:00]
doing that and at the very least if I'm
putting in that type of effort and
getting something out of it I think
that's basically how I would define
success it'd be kind of hard if I wasn't
winning any money I think that would
kind of take away I think I probably
have to there has to be some some some
reward that is realized as well but uh

[2:31:17]
reward that is realized as well but uh
probably some combination of those two
the unifying success the same way when
you were struggling when you were let's
see in that downswing breaking into two
cares would you have had a similar
definition if I stopped you in Freeze
Frame time then and asked you

[2:31:30]
Frame time then and asked you
most likely yeah something pretty
similar because I was just at that point
you know I wouldn't be thinking about
you know being dominating six Max I was
just trying to get to 10 20 period but
that was just the vision that I had it's
always like okay I'm going to be working
towards my stretch point this is what

[2:31:46]
towards my stretch point this is what
makes a lot of sense for me and it
doesn't apply to everyone I mean I think
I'm just more of a type A personality so
if you're not that it's just not going
to resonate with you as much but you
know I think life you just kind of
Define what is Meaningful for you and

[2:32:00]
Define what is Meaningful for you and
that's ultimately what makes sense to me
when you say stretch points it makes me
Envision like a comfort zone in a circle
and then stretching the outer edges of
that comfort zone is those stretch marks
and if you pull it a bit further it's
going to stretch and go a bit further
the next time you have so much growth on
those kind of edges of where we feel

[2:32:16]
those kind of edges of where we feel
uncomfortable as you've talked about
even in your reflection of what was kind
of the lessons from poker it's tough
this challenge is this hard times and
this is kind of stretch point so I
really like for you how clear you've
been throughout your career in terms of
this North Star and always pushing those

[2:32:31]
this North Star and always pushing those
edges always trying to figure out what
you need to do to grow and improve and
yeah I think that's been a really good
lesson hopefully those going away listen
to this episode will reflect on that are
they stretching themselves are they
taking on challenges that leave them a
girl and also they got that kind of
normal style of the aiming for to pick a

[2:32:45]
normal style of the aiming for to pick a
better version himself or whatever their
own goals are
all right Kristoff as for you right now
any stretch goals at what's on the edges
for you do you feel like you also um
defined success as being on your limits
or do you have a different definition of
success for yourself
I think my definition of success is that

[2:33:01]
I think my definition of success is that
you are able to live your day-to-day to
on your terms and basically you get to
do whatever you want to do whenever you
want to do with whoever you want to do
like that sort of sense of freedom and

[2:33:15]
like that sort of sense of freedom and
that doesn't mean that I won't have time
to do nothing right it just means that
you want to be able to do something
because you want to do it not
necessarily because you have to so if
you manage to put yourself in the
position that you can just do things
because you are intrinsically motivated
to do them not because you have to I

[2:33:32]
to do them not because you have to I
think that would be my definition of
success
what's your definition of success Adam I
think I don't don't think I've ever
asked you
I think mine's actually changed over the
years but it all circles down now to

[2:33:46]
years but it all circles down now to
being happy day-to-day are you happy
with what you're doing because I think
often we will have success and happiness
on a different kind of graph and we will
try to achieve success in achievement
metrics and then we'll figure out the
whole happiness game and my kind of all
kind of mindset now is we need to find

[2:34:00]
kind of mindset now is we need to find
happiness on the Pursuits they need to
intertwine and these be the same thing
so uh yes have goals yes have things
you're pushing towards but have
enjoyments and happiness on that Pursuit
if you wake up with a smile on your face
and you're a cleaner and you enjoy
cleaner flaws well done you're a success
sexual version yourself well your pocket
player doesn't really matter it's more
like the enjoyment of what you're doing

[2:34:16]
like the enjoyment of what you're doing
obviously this doesn't mean every day
you're blissly happy doesn't mean you
don't have challenges and hard times but
you're happy on the pursuit of what
you're doing I think that is the my
personal definition yeah I think I think
I think you need to reach certain level
of success to to come to that

[2:34:30]
of success to to come to that
realization for example when I was when
I reached my own peak of my career I
remember the classic for the father
would feel better uh type of type of
feeling right and that's kind of why
you're more learned towards like indeed

[2:34:45]
you're more learned towards like indeed
what you say that it's the pursuit it's
the things that you do day to day if you
manage to enjoy your day today that's in
the end the goal like the present moment
the day-to-day that's all there is so if
you can be happy with your day-to-day
that is that that is success

[2:35:01]
that is that that is success
um
I wanted to ask you Matt you you already
mentioned prado's moment you mainly
played an ignition in the beginning you
made a million then after that you
switch to playing a more Global pool ACR
that's generally considered I would say

[2:35:17]
that's generally considered I would say
tougher you can tell me if that's true
yes or no
what made you make that decision to jump
in a tougher game
well I think one thing that happened is
that ACR just had more traffic you know

[2:35:31]
that ACR just had more traffic you know
for higher Stakes I think PokerStars was
kind of falling out of favor it I mean
even just simple things like I don't
think you can even deposit crypto on
PokerStars
um as far as I know and so a lot of the
games started dying there and
transitioning over to America's card

[2:35:45]
transitioning over to America's card
room and they kind of took the Baton and
ran with it and started adding 20 I mean
they already had 25.50 but they added
5100 and then more recently they added
100 200 and seeing the opportunity to
play again play the highest Stakes was
really appealing to me even though the
game was significantly tougher

[2:36:02]
game was significantly tougher
um I think just like
I couldn't if I would try to measure it
I would say
um I think my like reg to wreck ratio is
like 28 to 1. so there's very very very

[2:36:17]
like 28 to 1. so there's very very very
few recreational players
um that you're playing against on ACR so
um it's a tough game but obviously when
you're playing such a such high stakes
when they do play kind of a big uh
Financial payoff

[2:36:31]
you've mentioned stuff for games
what makes what are the characteristics
of
the players that playing these games
that make the game tougher
yeah the players that are going to be

[2:36:46]
yeah the players that are going to be
playing at 2550 and above
um overall I'd say they're a lot more
solid overall and make fewer big
mistakes I mean one thing that I would
find at ignition 1020
um
in particular just playing against other

[2:37:02]
in particular just playing against other
regs is they'd sometimes make mistakes
that no one should ever make like it's
just so embarrassingly bad
you know maybe that's right how you
gotta play the game I did say you gotta
embarrass yourself sometimes but there's

[2:37:15]
embarrass yourself sometimes but there's
a limit whereas that um ACR I would say
that rarely happens is that people have
fewer explicit weaknesses for you to
capitalize on and just kind of give free
EV away a lot less frequently

[2:37:30]
EV away a lot less frequently
so you have to really fight for it yeah
you that's part of why like man I really
have to study so hard is like they're
just if you're playing 25.50 you know
three-handed across multiple tables I
mean you know there's a really low
margin of error and the type of people

[2:37:45]
margin of error and the type of people
that are willing to play three-handed
are always going to be the top reg so
you're not going to be up against the
bum hunters in that situation that are
going to be a lot easier to exploit and
so it pushes you to study to take your
game to the highest level that you can

[2:38:01]
game to the highest level that you can
going forward what are some of your
goals in poker what drives you and how
do you stay motivated and when I say
actually stay motivated it's probably
better to ask how do you regain
motivation because just being motivated
all the time I don't think really it's

[2:38:16]
all the time I don't think really it's
really possible
yeah I mean in some ways I don't think
it I don't it doesn't take a ton of
conscious effort for me to
get or be motivated I think I'm very
motivated to play poker because I'm so
competitive and I enjoy this process I

[2:38:32]
competitive and I enjoy this process I
mean I I get a lot of enjoyment out of
just competing against the top
competition at the highest levels
um so I think that's something that just
kind of comes about sort of naturally
for me in terms of I don't even know

[2:38:46]
for me in terms of I don't even know
what my my goals would really be I mean
I guess like a technically I guess my
goal is to be Michael Jordan of online
poker I don't know what that means how
would you measure something like
whatever I don't even know like the next
hurdle is there something would you say

[2:39:00]
hurdle is there something would you say
there's something if you look at in
poker now is there like a next step and
is there so what would you need to
improve upon it yeah to make
the problem is that because I live in
the US I can't play on GG poker so I've
been talking with my wife about uh maybe

[2:39:15]
been talking with my wife about uh maybe
maybe we'd like to go to Vancouver for a
little bit and for me to be able to play
in some of the nosebleed games that are
being offered there and I mean in
particular like a little bit of fomo but
there's like some pretty intriguing
recreational players uh playing there

[2:39:30]
recreational players uh playing there
right now so
um that would be interesting but I mean
overall I feel like I've accomplished
pretty much and like if my poker career
ended now I would be extremely proud of
everything that I did
um so
you know anything that comes after this

[2:39:45]
you know anything that comes after this
is just kind of uh just bonus but the
motivation is pretty intrinsic for me
beyond that
what are you currently most curious
excited for when it comes down to poker
strategy let's say I want to do some
strategy with you I send you a message

[2:40:00]
strategy with you I send you a message
what topic would I need to drop in a
message for us to uh to jump on a call
hahaha
um I'm definitely studying a lot more
heads up now because I'm playing a
pretty significant amount of heads up

[2:40:15]
pretty significant amount of heads up
um which just kind of comes with the
territory when you're playing higher
Stakes the pools are smaller the people
that are willing to risk rag battling
and just fewer and fewer people
especially if you're known as a winning
player there's fewer people that are
going to want to play as much so it

[2:40:30]
going to want to play as much so it
seems like a lot of the time I'm playing
against I mean more often than not kind
of known players the 2550
and so that
you know just kind of learning not like
I didn't already know heads up but
really getting into the specifics of
heads up and taking a lot of the

[2:40:46]
heads up and taking a lot of the
approach and I took the six Max and kind
of putting that into heads up of like
okay how am I going to compose my ranges
and all these different situations and
how am I going to simplify things when
possible and so it's kind of there's a
level of it that's kind of like
re-learning and reapplying the same

[2:41:00]
re-learning and reapplying the same
principles that I used before
and then kind of re kind of seeing how
your principles apply to heads up
instead of six Max
yeah I mean it's a it's going to hold up
because it's an approach to how you
would learn a game in general

[2:41:16]
would learn a game in general
so it's like it's at the end of the day
it's like all right let's make a 25 flop
subset or whatever 49 flop subset and
see how often we see betting what what
boards are you know have what favorite
which sizings and how can I compose a
polarized range and so on and so forth

[2:41:30]
polarized range and so on and so forth
and doing the hand to note thing and
coming up with the you know theoretical
ranges for all these different spots
it's the same boring stuff just over and
over again but you get a lot of
satisfaction at the end of it when
you're playing and you get to see the
fruit of you know your labor yeah

[2:41:45]
fruit of you know your labor yeah
there's there's nothing more enjoyable
than having worked on a certain strategy
and you you getting to a situation where
like this is it this is exactly and that
is you know that it also works out
perfectly it's like wow what amazing and

[2:42:00]
perfectly it's like wow what amazing and
that yeah that's what Nick Howard talked
about in poker detox I remember this
specifically of like let's study things
that we're actually going to use like
when you study something and then the
next day or the next session you
actually use it whereas before he's like
studying like oh what do you do with
pocket threes in this like impossible

[2:42:16]
pocket threes in this like impossible
River situation that's what it's so damn
counterintuitive about it is that the
thing that makes us interested in
playing poker in the first place is that
it's really complicated it's unsolvable
you make you have to kind of make
decision with the you know incomplete
information but that's not the thing

[2:42:31]
information but that's not the thing
that's going to get you the most EV
because it's just impossible there's
almost nothing you can do about it but
there's all this other stuff that's more
boring almost too easy to study but
ultimately We'll add the most to your
win rate if you decide to focus on it

[2:42:47]
win rate if you decide to focus on it
wise words what uh would you like
our audience for our audience to be the
main takeaway of the conversation we
have today
well I think that if you're someone that

[2:43:00]
well I think that if you're someone that
is playing at small Stakes let's say
that might be a lot of the audience and
wants to get better I think if you've
been stuck where you're at for a while
you're probably going to need to make
some changes and I think for most people
that's going to be investing in yourself

[2:43:16]
that's going to be investing in yourself
in some way for me it worked out great
to do a coaching for profit but for
whoever's listening it might not be that
maybe it could be you know doing run at
once doing upswing whatever it could be
you know getting a premium GTO wizard

[2:43:31]
you know getting a premium GTO wizard
subscription and you know listening to
some great webinars
wizard
yeah
um you could be finding an individual
coach that you really resonate with and
booking some hours with them but I think

[2:43:45]
booking some hours with them but I think
the point is like you're gonna need to
probably get some help and be willing to
invest in that
and I'm sure like what's come across
very clearly is just how super organized
I am how hard I'm working and even

[2:44:00]
I am how hard I'm working and even
though everyone's different you're not
going to copy and do the exact same
things that I do you could but it's that
you have to it's probably going to take
a ton of work and you're going to have
to
on some level except that there's also
going to be quite a lot of suffering so

[2:44:16]
going to be quite a lot of suffering so
um I don't worry too much about
discouraging people by just telling you
how much is you're going to be it's
going to be a struggle because if you're
truly obsessed with poker then that's
not going to stop you so I think
if you're obsessed with poker then

[2:44:32]
if you're obsessed with poker then
um
I think I think it's a lot of your
interpretation and the
yeah it's like the interpretation of the
struggles right you you expected the

[2:44:45]
struggles right you you expected the
struggles and when the struggles come
yeah it's you don't interpret that it's
like oh this is maybe poker is not for
me right it's just yeah this this was
bound to happen this is what I have to
overcome so I don't think it should be
discouraging it's just realizing that

[2:45:00]
discouraging it's just realizing that
obstacles and you don't even overcome it
it's just a part of the process for
beginning they show you I need to show
you what's next to learn right you have
to learn a lot of things everyone
realize that you have to learn a lot of
[ __ ] to get to where where you are met
so if if there's an obstacle in the way

[2:45:15]
so if if there's an obstacle in the way
that's great because that's exactly the
thing that apparently you have to learn
and when you overcome that you you know
you progress to the next level until
you're at maths level
exactly and in terms of daily Behavior
everyone that's just going to ask
themselves what would Matt do and then

[2:45:30]
themselves what would Matt do and then
you know have that as like you have
Michael Jordan now our listeners I think
someone in poker detox cfp did have that
I think that was one of their poster
like their little you talk about Post-it
notes they're like what would Marinelli
do or something no but that I think
that's great right would Marinette do

[2:45:46]
that's great right would Marinette do
that no he wouldn't do that okay so I
won't do that either
right that's kind of uh not a smart way
to do it yeah do you have any final
words you would like to add to this
conversation Matt
um no I don't think so I mean I really

[2:46:00]
um no I don't think so I mean I really
appreciate you guys having me
you have any final questions Adam or uh
can we let Matt go
if we squeezed enough knowledge out of
him we could squeeze a few more gems but
no I'm very happy with the questions
we've covered today thank you very much
for your time Max you've been a great

[2:46:15]
for your time Max you've been a great
guest I'm sure the audience has got a
lot of notes written down and lots of
really actionable stuff they can work on
so we really appreciate you spending
some of us with us today
of course
not a bunch of wisdom bombs dropped on
this podcast thank you very much Matt
was a pleasure talking to you Adam what

[2:46:32]
was a pleasure talking to you Adam what
are your main takeaways of this
conversation
yeah it was a great conversation we
covered a lot from a mindset perspective
which was great for me to hear and yeah
one of the things that was really
dominant throughout the conversation was
this strong identity that he created for

[2:46:46]
this strong identity that he created for
himself and the belief that he could
achieve it so early in his career he set
the goal to be the best player in detox
now the best player online six marks and
it's this almost this like belief that I
can get there and he said something very
powerful you are who you choose to be

[2:47:00]
powerful you are who you choose to be
and I really like this because it comes
down to the way to site on the identity
what we want to be and then we reinforce
that with the actions we have and the
way we show up so for him what I got a
real strong sense of is a innate belief
that he could achieve the things he
wanted to and he was willing to back
that up with action which then

[2:47:15]
that up with action which then
reinforces the belief which then makes
more progress so really really strong
mindset in terms of his approaches and
then the other thing that kind of
combines well with that overarching
mindset is what he calls grit and this
is this kind of passion plus
perseverance so if you set a big
ambitious goal to achieve big things in

[2:47:30]
ambitious goal to achieve big things in
life you better be resilient you better
be able to tolerate stuff you better be
able to keep going so for him his grit
is the one where it allows him to keep
progressing and keep pushing past stuff
and we saw this in his career
particularly when he was shot taking 2K
and L and he lost 52k or by nine months

[2:47:45]
and L and he lost 52k or by nine months
that's not a short span of time to lose
money over and he still kept going and
still kept that belief only persevered
so I think for him doubling down on this
ability to tolerate time and Challenge
and times I also asked him what was the
biggest lesson you have learned from
poker and it was again perseverance to
take on adversity and to push past that

[2:48:01]
take on adversity and to push past that
so I think when you combine those two
together there's kind of perseverance
and grit to get through stuff with this
identity that I can achieve stuff and
the belief systems I think creates a
really nice model for everything that
comes from that so yeah I think super
strong mindset really liked all the

[2:48:15]
strong mindset really liked all the
stuff he shared he also shared some
vulnerable stuff about how painful
things were as well I think often from
an outside you can assume people have
the linear progress to the top and it's
easy it doesn't hurt
he said sometimes it was painful he had
to reflect you mentioned crying in his
rooms at times when he was on a big
downswing it gets tough sometimes even

[2:48:31]
downswing it gets tough sometimes even
with the kind of right approaches so
yeah really really happy with all the
stuff he shared I'm sure the audience
walking away will have some really
really actionable things to take so how
about yourself right now from a
technical side what were some things you
picked up on yeah you had an amazing
mindset for sure from a technical
perspective I'm basically I think the

[2:48:47]
perspective I'm basically I think the
main takeaway and definitely for people
to to listen back is the structure he
created in order to improve I think that
was the the main thing I used to teach
something similar like the feedback loop
I think it's also a concept in you also

[2:49:02]
I think it's also a concept in you also
mentioned rate daily or somewhere in the
podcast uh the I think the loop of
continuous Improvement or the process of
continuous Improvement he calls it I
believe and basically it comes down to
he leak finds and everything that he
does I think is very important he does

[2:49:15]
does I think is very important he does
deliberate intentional and he makes
quantifiable these are the three things
that kept on coming back as well and
that's very important for him so he leak
finds again he does it very deliberately
because he goes through its database
because he wants to improve on certain
points because you know if he improves

[2:49:30]
points because you know if he improves
in those points he will start to make
more money be able to rise up the stakes
and reach his goals right he makes those
quantifiable he Compares his stats to
for example Pi outputs trying to play as
optimal as possible if you for example
found that your population might be
overfolding a certain spot you might

[2:49:46]
overfolding a certain spot you might
want to aim for a number that's a bit
higher than piyo
um then he basically if he finds certain
League he goes into his process of
strategy development that he mentioned
so I think he mentions he runs a bunch
of subsets starts to look at the
frequencies in the spot and I may be

[2:50:01]
frequencies in the spot and I may be
missing certain frequencies you will
pick a sizing and start to big his
strategy that he wants to play I think
this is a very important point that
people often Overlook they just review a
hand in for example Wizard and they just
didn't play these hands correctly but

[2:50:15]
didn't play these hands correctly but
they don't have never really thought
about
how I will approach a spot from a
strategical perspective what's the
strategy that I want to play and from
that Baseline strategy you know you can
still deviate but it's good to have a
baseline strategy okay and in strategy
development the amplify emphasized the

[2:50:31]
development the amplify emphasized the
importance of trying to keep it simple
so you can stay accurate
and when he looks at hand he looks for
certain heuristics he can use right this
is something that comes back for our
podcast they don't just look at the

[2:50:46]
podcast they don't just look at the
software for reviewing their hand no
they look at they try to understand why
they look for certain heuristics that
they can build their principles around
approaching poker
then he reviews before he plays he
Reveals His strategical intentions he
sets an attention for the session and

[2:51:00]
sets an attention for the session and
then again deliberately starts to play
and a session then can be used to try to
implement this Focus point right nothing
is greater I think he also mentioned
that if you've worked on a certain
strategy and you can apply it in game
and you see it working and basically

[2:51:15]
and you see it working and basically
afterwards he will review again make it
quantifiable maybe at a certain stage
again review his database to Compare the
numbers but at least after every session
he reviews the hint I think it's just
every pods greater than six big blinds I
think I also gave some examples
basically if you find certain leaks you
can create filters and just review every

[2:51:31]
can create filters and just review every
spot uh where you're basically leaking
and you review those and in those you
will probably find some things that
you're doing wrong okay and you could
maybe write that down again I think
prioritization was also a very big key

[2:51:46]
prioritization was also a very big key
right it was frequency plus average bot
size that was kind of the formula that
he used and out of that roles the
importance of the league so for people
who have a lot of leaks
um I mean me included everyone included
to help you prioritize the leak

[2:52:01]
to help you prioritize the leak
frequency plus average bot size that was
kind of the formula that I used and then
basically it's repeat right people might
be asking yeah well at some point you're
done though you're never done this this
is just this is the life that you live
you're just gonna repeat this cycle and

[2:52:15]
you're just gonna repeat this cycle and
obviously the leaks that you will be
studying will become bigger and bigger
uh smaller and smaller and smaller
because you start with your biggest
leaks and you narrow it down and later
also you become more nuanced so don't
think you really touch on that but also
with strategy creation if you keep it
simple in the beginning and you already
went through all the spots and you play

[2:52:31]
went through all the spots and you play
Everything quite solidly then afterwards
you might add some Nuance okay to
instead of just saying okay I study a
229 High board you can maybe add some
new ones one has a straight one doesn't
have a straight one is nine eight deuce
the other one is nine Deuce three how

[2:52:46]
the other one is nine Deuce three how
does that change right but this is not
something in the early stage that you
wanna
go to deep down the rabbit hole in
because you will make it very
complicated for yourself the first goal
is to get good heuristic good principles
to approach all the spots so a lot of

[2:53:00]
to approach all the spots so a lot of
knowledge you I'm sure we could talk on
for hours and hours like actually we
have with mode guest that's why the
podcast you know it can take a little
while I want to thank Adam for posting
