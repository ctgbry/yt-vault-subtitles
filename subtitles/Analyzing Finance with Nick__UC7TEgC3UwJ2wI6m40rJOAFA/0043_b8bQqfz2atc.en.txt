hello and welcome to analyzing fiats
with nick
this video is the first of a multi-part
series where i break down the economic
futures of several countries throughout
the world what do they have to look
forward to
what are the downside risks and what are
my expectations on whether these
countries will thrive or struggle for
the rest of the 21st century
first one i'm talking about is portugal
a reason i'm starting with portugal is
because in response to my greek debt
crisis reaction i've got comments and
private messages from viewers about who
do you think is the next greece
and so the first few videos in the
series i'm going to analyze developed
nations who are at risk of losing
their first world status
and the first one that kind of stood out
to me unfortunately is portugal
i mean i love portugal personally as i'm

[01:01]
i mean i love portugal personally as i'm
25 portuguese my grandmother this
heritage from the azores and madera my
fifth
cousin is a somewhat of a famous
celebrity locally in portugal
and
when i visited i've enjoyed it
the problem really is though is that
despite its glorious history and culture
their economic position is more
on the rocks
portugal originally built
its
colonial empire and its economic footing
through exploration
through the ability to
sail across the atlantic and around the
cape of good hope
faster than its rivals due to its
position in the atlantic ocean and the
having tall enough trees to build the
mass needed to have for those days the
15th century modern caraval ships gave

[02:00]
15th century modern caraval ships gave
portugal an early head start and they
had colonies and trading posts
all over
west africa south and eastern africa
in modern day india sri lanka macau
china
and
all over southeast asia as well and then
our most famous colony
is of course brazil to this day
which
brazil has developed into a much
larger portuguese speaking country than
its father country of portugal itself
so
that's how they originally
built their economy was on trade
and extracting resources from its
colonies around the world
however
as the rest of the world started to
catch up to portugal's naval technology
portugal just lacked the manpower
to hold defend much more populated than

[03:00]
to hold defend much more populated than
larger european powers most notably
france the netherlands
and
britain and spain as well
and so portugal and really what put the
seal in the deal for portugal as a
european power was the great
earthquake of lisbon in the early 1700s
which really kind of
shook
the country to its core and made it
difficult to recover
however the modern
economy of portugal is not completely
lost cause i mean portugal is a
developed nation
it may be one of the least successful
countries economically in western europe
but that's a pretty high bar to cross
given how successful western europe is
overall and unlike greece
portugal has
a lot more major corporate players in
the multinational game
these include the navigator company
which is a major world player and
international paper market

[04:01]
international paper market
sony industria the largest producer of
wood-based panels in the world
and
portugal is also the world's leader in
producing and exporting cork so if you
have a european wine bottle there's a
good chance that the cork that's holding
it that's keeping it fresh
was made in portugal
portugal also
has large multinational construction
companies
a retailer called geronimo martins which
is notably of portugal poland and
columbia
and edp renault
which is the third largest producer of
wind energy in the world so they're
doing some things right
on the corporate level
however
compared to
other european countries
they have
a problem with innovation and growth
and there's certain reasons
that why that is the case that we're

[05:01]
that why that is the case that we're
going to be
getting into in the rest of this
presentation
let's compare
portugal though where it stands now
versus say united states state of
indiana
um indiana is not
one of the most prosperous
states in the united states it's not
california it's not texas
or florida
if there are multinationals in indiana
similar to portugal but
it's not
really known as like a linchpin of the
american economy and often lags in
certain statistics to ge per capita and
life expectancy
now
compared to
many other parts of the country
however
for all the faults that may people make
this particularly
people who live on the east and west
coast would criticize indiana
indiana's economy is far more successful

[06:00]
indiana's economy is far more successful
than portugal they're about the same
size land wise as you see in this
picture
portugal has a population of 10.3
million whereas indiana has about
two-thirds of the population
yet indiana's gdp
is
100 billion more than portugal's
and if you adjust it for purchasing
power because generally the cost of
living and things such as food and rents
are much lower in portugal than they are
even in a midwestern state such as
indiana which is not known for being
particularly expensive to live in
it is still
about the same
what really plagues portugal is its high
public spending and unemployment
public spending in portugal is
48.4 percent of gdp
whereas in indiana and this is including
indiana's share of
federal spending
because you have to count the federal
government's percentage of gdp to all

[07:00]
government's percentage of gdp to all
the states because they get net federal
benefits there's 22.7 percent
of gdp the federal state government
combined
unemployment is only 3.9 percent in
indiana
where it's 6.8 percent in portugal
so
i mean if portugal
is
doing
worse than one of the economically
weaker states in the united states
that is a problem
and why this is the case there's a lot
to do with similar reasons that took
down greece
you have a bloated public sector
most of that
is through
spent on social protection programs
about 40 percent
and
portugal
problem is and this is similar to other
european countries that
without transfer payments 45 percent of
portuguese citizens would be below the
poverty line

[08:01]
poverty line
which
is a considerable problem you have a
large chunk of the population
relying on transfer payments and that's
why
the government spending is so high
on top of that you also have the issues
of
immigration
portugal has the highest emigration rate
as a proportion of its population in the
european union
more than 2 million portuguese which is
about 20 percent of the population now
live outside the country they're
commonly found in spain
luxembourg of all places
belgium switzerland germany
and uk
where there's just more job
opportunities particularly for
educated people which is why the
multinational thing matters so much
portugal's industry profile
is better than say like a
emerging market country which generally

[09:00]
emerging market country which generally
relies on just raw material exports and
tourism
but they're more second order
goods and services versus the advanced
ones that
dominate the export profile of
uh
of more prosperous countries like
portugal i said as a lead producer of
cork
paper they make some textiles ceramics
glassware
windmill wind
power
components and building materials
and
some telecommunications
hardware as well
and there's a little bit of base metals
mining
but generally it's
it's second level on the value chain so
it's above like em but it's still below
say like
i don't know america's or the uk spot or
germany spot on the value chain
and
why did portugal lag well portugal had a
very
turbulent politics

[10:01]
turbulent politics
they were ruled under a corporatist
some would say a fascist dictatorship
um
up until 1974
and then they had the carnation
revolution which
where they lost their colonies which was
a big part of their economy and trade
with them such as macau
goa in india
angola
mozambique and cape verde
verde
and
there is also a lot of refugees of
portuguese people from those places who
moved back due to the hostility of those
regions breaking away
and that adjusting for those factors
caused portugal to slide in terms of its
performance as a percentage of the
average
eurozone economy
to
from its high
at 56 um
of
gd of the ec12 average which is the
predecessor to the eurozone

[11:01]
predecessor to the eurozone
down to
52.3 percent
and to this day
it's gained some gap back
it's now at about in the 60s percentile
but their gv per capita is still
not that high compared to some of the
larger powers and they got admitted to
the eu in the late 80s
and
that helped them similar to greece be
able to get much cheaper financing than
they would otherwise to
again build
much larger welfare state and some of
these ghost jobs that i mentioned in the
reaction video to greece they had
the same type of
clientelism
and institutionalized corruption
that took just not to the same degree
and its gb per capita its peak reached
of the eu 25 average

[12:01]
of the eu 25 average
and now sits
below
and now we're going to get into
why i think portugal may not be out of
the woods yet
because
right now
it's nobody's really thinking about that
because the eu implicitly once mario
draghi did his whatever it takes promise
in 2012 and then expand on that through
the ecb's qe program which they still
haven't removed despite inflation kind
of starting to
rip up again in europe
to
buy enough debt to keep the credit
spreads twice as tight but sorry between
the country
and also
prevent any sort of financing risk
because
portugal's debt to gdp has not
fallen enough for it to be
self-sustaining if it had to rely on

[13:00]
self-sustaining if it had to rely on
market forces for interest rates
if we look at again the gdp per capita i
saw this in the grease video too
portugal peaked at 25 000
per year in u.s dollars
and and now
in today's adult it's lower than it was
in its peak in 2007 just like the other
pigs countries in the mediterranean
its fall
has been more modest it's down maybe
about six percent from its highs whereas
greece is down 40 percent
and italy is down 20 percent
and spain is also down over 20 percent
but portugal also never really reached
the same type of living standards that
these other countries did
and has always been kind of a borderline
developed market as a result
and i mentioned with government debt

[14:01]
and i mentioned with government debt
it's deep into the danger zone with
portugal
uh they did do some
austerity measures that were forced as
part of the conditions of
um getting help from the imf and they
didn't even get a budget surplus in
2016. so because of that they were taken
off a lot of the governors that
um
that the eu restricted their um
their government spending on but then
with the pandemic happened
they basically shattered their previous
record and now they're back at 133
percent of gdp like the historical
breaking level for a country
for debt to gdp that's very difficult to
come back from is in the 90 to 100
percent range
and
that's been
long gone for portugal's
for the last decade or so
and really what's keeping them afloat is
the ecb
willing

[15:00]
willing
to
keep subsidizing their debt like they're
doing with all the peripheral countries
so the next thing is that why portugal
what do you what are the reasons for it
i mean again i mentioned they
that they don't have as developed of an
economy as some of their
competitors in western europe and peers
and
that
they have a high government debt and a
high reliance on the welfare state and
social spending
but
what really i think is the thing that
kind of messed up portugal unfortunately
and caused a lot of this
was their policies on education
portugal had a very poor track record
compared to the rest of the developed
countries in terms of education
back when the salazar regime was in
charge they had a philosophy that people

[16:00]
charge they had a philosophy that people
should just be happy in their station of
life
and therefore
he did not prioritize education
particularly for the working and lower
classes and he's like they're going to
be lower class anyway why bother to
educate them this was a kind of a
full-hearted policy
and it's led to a severe under-education
rate of portugal versus the rest
of europe
they have the lowest overall education
rates in western europe with over 50
percent of the population in working age
25 to 64 not finishing high school not
college high school
this is the lowest
in the oecd and this was as low as 28
in 2011 i mean they've made some part of
their structural reforms that they've
been making the past decade is to
increase the priority of
education
and
as a result
the dropout rate for portugal has
dropped considerably
and more people in portuguese descent

[17:01]
and more people in portuguese descent
are finishing
high school and college which is a good
thing the high school dropout rate
though even now it's at 17.4 percent
which is the highest
among
developed countries
and was 38
before secondary stool became mandatory
in 2013
and
at its worst countries that you wouldn't
expect such as turkey and mexico had
higher high school graduation rates than
portugal again they've improved it now
and if you look at the chart on the
right from
the imf
it really kind of shows that
you've got some improved quite a bit of
improvement
in the education rates in portugal
portugal has risen from being close to
the bottom of the tack
to now more in the middle of the pack
for
high school graduation rates
uh portugal is still below the oecd
average of about 81

[18:01]
average of about 81
it's at 78
as of 2019 but that is a significant
improvement i just the thing that's
weird is that
their dropout rate is probably 17.4 but
their graduation rate would imply a 22
dropout rate
i don't if any of my viewers know what
it counts for that difference
that would be interesting no but it's
still quite low like you could compare
say the united states which has an 86
percent high school graduation rate
or mediterranean peers such as greece
and italy who are over 90
where south korea is at 96
at the world's highest
i mean
a country that can't graduate 80 percent
of its population from high school is
having a problem i think this education
thing
is the root of it because
it creates one thing one
it creates a lack of skilled workers and
entrepreneurs to build the modern

[19:01]
entrepreneurs to build the modern
businesses and dynamic economy needed
for portugal to grow
two those who do get educated and go to
college i get because
surprisingly portugal has a high
percentage of its
high school graduates do
move on to university and they're in
line with oecd averages for college
graduation rates they move they
immigrate to other parts of europe where
there are more economic opportunity
and so
this spiral of having a brain drain of
your best
academically talented people leaving
and then the rest of them not having the
skills to
support
us like
a modern economy of a high gp per capita
they this country just doesn't generate
enough income to subsidize this bloated
public sector and also because a lot of
these people are not economically
competitive due to edu lack of education
they have to have more

[20:00]
they have to have more
public benefits to support them and that
causes the state to be as bloated as it
is so it's kind of a spiral
again there's been a lot of effort to
fix it but when you have such a residual
of
especially with longer lifespans now of
generations of portuguese people not
prioritizing education and i will have
citations for all this because this
sounds crazy to me too when i first came
up with it
it's going to cause
trouble and so that's why i think
if the ecb
tavern
puts on pulls off the gas of bailing out
a lot of these sovereign countries i
think portugal
will
be at risk of a crisis again
overall
what can we learn from portugal like
otherwise the importance of young people
watching this stay in school and
portugal kind of shows you
the value of education

[21:00]
the value of education
um
other than that
what can we learn what
can the lessons from greece and portugal
be used for
how other economies should act and also
what other countries have similar trends
i'd like to hear your thoughts and
comments about portugal if i have
portuguese listeners
and viewers let me know what you think
of the situation and am i wrong about
how
the education rates
are alarmingly low
i don't like seeing my paisamos have
these academic problems but it kind of
explains why portugal has lagged the way
it has especially in the 21st century
thank you for watching
