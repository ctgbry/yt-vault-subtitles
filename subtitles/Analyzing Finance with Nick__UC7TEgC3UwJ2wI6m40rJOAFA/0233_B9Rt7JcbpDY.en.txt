the hardest thing in the world to
understand is the income tax Albert
Einstein can you tax the rich enough to
balance the government budget that is
the question I'm going to answer like a
lot of people think inequality is a
problem and you can solve the
government's fiscal problems simply just
by taxing the rich more I wanted to
challenge this and just kind of add up
the numbers and see how much money would
need to be taxed in terms of a wealth
tax to be able to balance the budget and
pay off the national debt first let's
use the United States as my example
because the United States has the most
billionaires so is the most likely
country to be able to pull this off and
has also the most amount of Senti
billionaires and the most amount of
Senti Millionaires and just in general
the most amount of people with high net
worth say over 20 million which is
according to this channel what the
definition of truly rich is so with that

[01:02]
definition of truly rich is so with that
let's get into the numbers first the
number of billionaires in the United
States according to inequality.org is
$5.3 trillion in Combined wealth that by
comparison the national debt in the
United States is $33 trillion and the
deficit this year is $1.9 trillion
dollar which is a record high so if you
just used the deficit yeah the national
debt is going to cover about two years
and nine months worth of the national
deficit oh if you took every dollar away
from every billionaire in the United
States there could be hidden money and
other assets that just are privately
held so let's just round it up to 6
trillion that's three years of the
national debt now what about that
billionaires aren't the only rich people
out there what about CTI millionaires
people's net worth 100 million to 999

[02:00]
people's net worth 100 million to 999
million there are about 8,400 of them in
the US as 2021 so it's slightly higher
now and their total wealth let's just
assume that the average person in this
category is a $250
million net worth it's probably lower
but let's just use this to because of
power law Dynamics with these kind of
things but to use that number estimate
of 2.1 trillion but we're going to round
it up due to inflation and economic
growth so it's probably closer now to
2.5 trillion so now puts us at a
combined $8.5 trillion in worth so if
you took away all the money from the
billionaires and the stiil millionaires
that will pay for about a fourth of the
national debt and it will pay for about
4 and a half years or so of the national
deficit which is kind of crazy to think
how Financial the US fiscal crisis
really is right now I'm just putting it
into numbers now we factored all the
billionaires

[03:00]
billionaires
and all
9,850 Cent millionaires in the United
States and next what we have to do is we
need to discuss the 20 to $100 million
range because according to the
definition of this own channel you're
truly Rich if you're at least 20 million
in net worth so that adds another tens
of thousands of people to this equation
and if you add up all of their net worth
the net worth of the ctim millionaires
and the net worth of the billionaires
the total now you're getting is closer
to 12 to 13 trillion dollars according
to aggregators who track this stuff such
as Henley and Associates and I'll have
citations in the video for this for
people who want numbers on all of it and
these are approximations because the
economy has grown and these studies are
static They Don't Really C in every
fluctuation in the market necessarily so
I am just using kind of round ballp part

[04:01]
I am just using kind of round ballp part
figures and the upside estimates really
for all of this is of a total for
everybody if you include billionaires
ctim Millionaires and the 20 million
plus the total is I'd say 6 billion for
the CH trillion sorry for the
billionaires 2.5 trillion for the centa
Millionaires and then another 12 to 14
TR trillion for the 20 million plus
people so if you add all these together
it's probably about $ 20
trillion which because covers at current
levels a little less than 2/3 of the
national debt and 10 years of the
deficit the problem really that I kind
of forgot to mention all this is if you
just take everybody's money all at once
they no longer have any Capital to
reinvest in their businesses and you
don't really have any cumulative wealth
to tax because you just robbed everybody

[05:02]
to tax because you just robbed everybody
over $20 million in net worth of all
their money so they really isn't any
left so this is only a one-time thing
which is why if you want to make it work
you would need it to be able to pay off
effectively the entire debt and it does
a little bit more than half so it does
it just a sizable chunk but then you
basically killed your productive
capacity and you all of your
entrepreneurial Talent is basically
never going to want want to try to take
any risk cuz they know that this type of
Repro can happen again so you can't just
do a blanket sweep there's clearly it's
not enough and it's the pro let's just
say if they try to do this like in a
wealth tax where you tax a small amount
of that every year and hopefully that
accumulates and compounds over time so
that you still have your tax base left
let's just say on that 20 trillion you
had a 5% wealth tax every year that

[06:03]
had a 5% wealth tax every year that
would give you 1 trillion a year that
would cover at the current Pace half of
the deficit So in theory you can cover
half the deficit to and make it a much
more manageable level and maybe cut the
defense spending by a little bit and do
a few other fiscal arrangements and you
could theoretically balance the budget
with a 5% annual wealth tax if you did a
10% annual wealth tax then you saw the
problem theoretically however in
practice there's there's there's
problems with this too one if you get as
high as 10% for your wealth management
side of things then you're going to have
the fundamental issue that you're not
going to be able to compound returns
fast enough to make up for the losses in
the wealth tax and so as a result those
fortunes will eventually be eroded
within a decade so you're going to kill
your tax base cuz that rate is too high
let's just say you do 5% and let's just

[07:01]
let's just say you do 5% and let's just
say for conservatively that's the same
amount of return on investment that
these billionaires can get on average
every year on their Capital so they're
effectively you're taking away their
entire Roi like they have to keep their
base but any Returns on investment
essentially are going to the government
then that creates its own set of
problems first of all why would these
people stay in the country they would
move and renounce their citizenships and
yeah they might have to pay an exit tax
which which is on the books in the
United States you would have to do that
and the exit tax could theoretically fix
this but if you have that sort of wealth
and power they will try to find ways to
avoid that too there still is the
problem of capital flight and all this
money is going to move out and therefore
you're not going to have the recurring
Revenue you hope for from such a policy
and I don't really think at any level
this is going to work because one
there's the slippery slope problem even
if it's a small one just 1% for those of
100 Mill ion like Harris is proposing

[08:01]
100 Mill ion like Harris is proposing
people are going to see that oh they're
going to eventually raise it and use it
to hit me too and it's going to cause a
panic and that Panic is going to cause a
lot of people to sell their assets and
leave and also a lot of that I mentioned
before in my video about the the great
wealth transfer there's a large chunk of
this wealth that 10% of it is
concentrated in family businesses and
another 20 to 30% is in real estate
which are all liquid what do you expect
people to do if their wealth is almost
all in those are they have to sell a
fraction of their of their family
business every year to pay the wealth
tax I mean again I got into more of
these issues in a video that I did back
in June back when Biden was still a
candidate about why this unrealized
capital gains tax policy is an
unmitigated disaster so I'm not going to
get repeat that whole thing here but in
general the capital flight's going to be
a severe issue and the devaluation of
assets as a result of increased selling

[09:02]
assets as a result of increased selling
pressure to cover these taxes and lower
valuations because the after wealth tax
returns on everything is going to be
lower so people are going to be willing
to pay less for Investments so let's
just say we instead of the 5% it's a 1%
wealth tax like Harris proposed except
it only applies down to people of 20
million or more that would be about
20000 billion in revenues which would
cover about 10% of the deficit which is
not going to really be enough to really
fix the fiscal situation the deficit
needs to be go down by at least 50% if
not more for a longer term sustainable
path and you're risking basically
torching The credibility of the capital
markets and The credibility of the us as
a safe place to store Capital so that's
why I don't really think that could work
and it's it needs to be big enough that
you can pay off this stuff relatively
quickly
and without doing too much damage to the

[10:01]
and without doing too much damage to the
country's credibility so in theory the
answer is can you tax your way out of
the debt problem the answer is
surprisingly yes the longer term
Consequence the economy will probably be
much worse if you did it but in theory a
wealth tax of about 10% per year or even
5% a year would be enough really to fix
a lot of the fiscal situation with a few
minor changes elsewhere however that is
not going in practice that will not work
due to the the unintended consequences
and how people would react to such a
policy people just didn't change
anything they were doing now and just
blindly went along with this yeah that
would work great and that's how a lot of
these policies sound good on paper
because they don't really they really
ignore the factors of Human Action that
will cause unintended consequences in
people to react in ways that are adverse
to making the policy work however even
with basically robbing everybody who's
wealthy in this country blind it's still

[11:00]
wealthy in this country blind it's still
not enough to pay off the debt
completely if you did it in one fill
swoop and barely enough really to fix
the deficit if you did it in a more
gradual swoop so what is the answer how
do you fix the fiscal situation in the
United States well that's a much longer
conversation and a separate one from
this video if you would want me to make
a proposed budget of how to balance the
government's finances please leave a
like or a comment and if I get enough
requests perhaps I'll make a video of
that thank you guys all for watching
