hello and welcome to analyzing finance
with nick in today's video i'm going to
talk about the concept of adverse
selection which
on service level sounds just some like
obscure concept in economics but
it is actually surprisingly much more
applicable in your day-to-day life than
you would expect first let's start with
a definition
adverse election is a market situation
where buyers and sellers have different
information
some markets the buyer
knows more than the seller so therefore
the seller may
sell a product for too low of a price
because they don't know what the real
value of that is this is mostly in life
insurance which i'll explain later
whereas
most times it's usually the seller has
more information than the buyer
and because
of this this market is often dominated
by negative selection bias and what i

[01:00]
by negative selection bias and what i
mean by negative selection bias is that
the worst
example
of the
of whatever the good or service provided
in the market is will be more common
than the normal distribution
the reason for this is because if nobody
can tell
what is the good egg from the bad egg
the market will price everything only
slightly above what the bad egg is and
so therefore good eggs knowing that
they're not going to be sold for their
fair value will not enter the market
let's go for like an example that's more
relatable particularly to my audience
and that is daily market most of my
audience is younger single guys so i use
this as an example
and i don't mean this a social
commentary at all with the ratios here
it's all hypothetical and i think that
could also it also applies the other way

[02:00]
could also it also applies the other way
around for women in the daily market too
with men
when it so this is an example of let's
just say you're in your town
there are 30
attractive women who you
think of as prospective dating partners
the green box is the number of them who
are in
committed relationships which is
two-thirds of them which i think is
probably actually pretty accurate
in society for
younger demographics
and
the red box
is those who would be
not well suited to being in a
relationship due to personality
issues incompatibility
a variety of other things they're just
not they don't really make good
long-term romantic partners or spouses
and as you see here
you have

[03:00]
you have
the people
in
the relationship category
you would say only 20
of the women who are in the relationship
category have
those
bad character flaws
and it's about 33 percent
for the entire population in this sample
but in the single population
it's 60 percent
and let's just make this even more
realistic that there are some
intelligent women who understand the
concept of adverse selection for men
which is the same exact scenario here
and they leave the dating market
so
the remaining dating market really for
the single guy
is
75 people who would be bad fits for
relationships and only 25 who would be
good fits this is an example of adverse
selection here and negative selection

[04:01]
selection here and negative selection
bias
the prospective dating partners who
would be good for relationships are most
of them in relationships so
in this example like
it's 22 out of 30
um
who would be good fits for you
over 90 of them are taken
whereas those who are bad fits for you
make up 75 of your dating pool
uh
so this is like the exam so and the
thing the problem is it's average
selection because you don't know this
going in
as the buyer in this case
all right
like you don't know that 75 of your
potential spouses are trouble but you'll
take them all on a date anyway because
you're because you hope that one of them
can and the reason why a lot of people
get bitter in the dating market and
leave like in this example here

[05:00]
leave like in this example here
is because
even if
you're going out there making an effort
the probabilities are high enough that
you're going to run into the bad egg
that you can easily go a whole lifetime
never finding somebody who has a good
fit or
not even a lifetime but long enough that
you just give up
by just constantly running in to the
people in the red box
and not running in
to somebody who would be good for you
even though somebody is good for you is
the majority
of the pool
they're just either not available
or you can't find them just because the
people who are available are dominated
by the ones who are not good fits for
you
then in economics in the industry side
there are several
sectors of the economy where adverse
selection is common
insurance is one particularly life
insurance if you're somebody selling
life insurance
people who are going to buy life

[06:00]
people who are going to buy life
insurance aren't necessarily young
healthy people
who don't have any
like family obligations
they're usually older people who may
have health complications are more
likely to buy life insurance because
they have a higher mortality probability
options trading is another example of
this
and same with car insurance before it
became mandatory um in most states like
the people who were more reckless
drivers would be more likely to buy car
insurance
options trading is another example of
this
when you are
trading an option
and you're circulating if you're selling
an option
the buyer may know something more than
you you either i mean that there know
something that's
illegal and trading on insider
information
or
they just simply are smarter analysts
than you
uh

[07:00]
uh
you can
lose a lot of money
trading against somebody who's
sharper than you
uh
the used car market is another example
the previous owner of the car knows a
lot more about the car than you do
and it's any other secondhand goods like
if somebody's selling like a tv
well maybe you that you don't know if
the t of the bulb has one day left or
three years left in the tv or if it was
stolen or you don't know whether that
happened to that before it's only what
the sellers have to disclose or is
willing to disclose or the car you don't
know
um you may know like the basic things
like the mileage but you may not know if
it's been an accident before
you may not know
if the person never washed their car for
10 years or was a chronic smoker
and therefore
the car is not really in as good shape
as you think it is there's things such

[08:00]
as you think it is there's things such
carfax which helps disclose some of this
but it's not perfect real estate is
another example
uh
you don't know
like the seller doesn't have to say like
how
often the roof needs to be replaced or
whether there's a
um
a secret
uh
pest problem and there's a bunch of
termites that are growing inside the
basement of the house
or a variety of other things
or then professional sports this is
probably the most egregious example is
like a contract year signing a free
agent on a contract you're in baseball
or basketball
they you know about their previous
performance but you don't really know
their true motivation but you still have
to guarantee them the money anyway and
so a lot of times you sign a player
who's
only extrinsically motivated they got
their money so they're not going to try
anymore and their performance is going
to be lower than expected or you may see

[09:03]
to be lower than expected or you may see
somebody who's intrinsically motivated
wants to be the greatest
doesn't matter they don't want to sit
fat happy in the money and that contract
will be under value
uh the lich and speaking of just
contracts the labor market in general
employers don't know everything about an
employee they don't know their whole
life story
and employees don't know
what the employers have paid previous
people
who have the same skills
i mean some of this stuff is a little
bit more transparent thanks to things
like glassdoor
and linkedin and background checks but
it's not perfect and because of that
there could be mispricings uh gambling
particularly poker that's why i show the
dogs playing poker example in the
definition slide
everybody has a different hand you may
have two kings but you don't know if the
guy sitting next to you has two aces and
damn texas hold him
or he has two twos and so if he's

[10:02]
or he has two twos and so if he's
bluffing or
is making a big bet with conviction
you you don't know and then politics
politics say somebody's running for
office and they say all the right things
you vote for them you have no idea what
their deep down inside their ethics are
and if they're actually going to do what
they say they're going to do there's
also the negative selection bias problem
is that people who do not want to play
the dirty games
or
be involved with the dirty money side of
politics or be compromised or don't want
their
family's reputation to get in the mud
won't participate and won't run for
office so it really only leaves the
people
who
either don't care about that stuff
or are willing to sacrifice that because
they don't have better opportunities in
the private sector
and so that's an example
of adverse selection is

[11:01]
of adverse selection is
selection of who actually runs for
office in a lot of the time and there
are good people who run for office
but the fact that
the bad often outweighs the good
makes it
an adversely selected choice is what we
vote for in a given election that's not
really a party line thing that's just a
democracy thing
so how can we solve and deal with this
problem
disclosures
and lemon laws
for used cars they have laws that have
require certain disclosures
of a guard's history and allow returns
if
something was misleading uh
things just being out there the internet
has helped a lot with adverse selection
because
it empowers the retail buyer or seller
who's not
um
who would not be as knowledgeable
otherwise just to become more
knowledgeable how to negotiate in these
types of situations warranties is

[12:01]
types of situations warranties is
another one
and inspections like this is how
housing
adverse election is solved is that you
hire a third party inspector to inspect
the property before
the escrow closes
warranty same thing for if you buy
something at a store and you're not sure
if it's a dud or something like that you
get a warranty to protect you
and then the last one just general
critical thinking and awareness of this
concept
if you look into anything
um
in a
market scenario or social scenario
think about the incentives think about
where the knowledge holes are
and
the
whether there is an adverse selection
problem or negative selection bias and
if you know that you'll be aware of it
like
the dating example none of these other
issues would work to solve that you
can't
inspect somebody's entire life history
there's no warranties for marriages or

[13:00]
there's no warranties for marriages or
lemon laws that would be kind of funny
but that's not how the world works
so if you have to just realize
that it could be there's an adverse
selection component
to what to the dating market
and
don't get down yourself if you have
several bad dates in a row
that concludes the lesson on adverse
selection thanks for watching
