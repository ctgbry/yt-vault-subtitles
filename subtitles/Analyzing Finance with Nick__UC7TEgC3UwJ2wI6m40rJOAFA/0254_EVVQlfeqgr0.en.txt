[00:01]
I okay I'm finally I'm finally back I
apologize for that I don't understand
why my router decided to just like kill
die in the middle of the live stream uh
but yeah now we are back I think what
I'm going to do really is I will keep
the
original live stream and at as a
separate video where I'm just going to
upload the pre descriptive
questions and hopefully we can bring
things back from here um yeah I'm I
again I'd like to apologize for a
technical issue which I had no idea how
that happened like that but now we're
back and I'm just G to go back through
some of the
um the questions that you guys left
because I made sure to copy the live
chat play so that I wouldn't

[01:02]
chat play so that I wouldn't
lose my place
so yeah let's
see do you see the next question do you
realistically see the level of wealth
inequality correcting within the next 30
well it already started
correcting I
but and the problem is like holding F
correction US mean something bad happen
economically there's a book Walter
Shield named The Great leveler it talks
about what are the typ of things that
cause inequality to go down over long
periods of time or short periods of time
and it's
usually
War
um poverty terms of like famine
or
revolution oh the audio is now messed up
too

[02:01]
too
oh great I I don't understand why I
might have to delay this then okay or
good yeah I I was just kind of concerned
about yeah the some of the technical
issues here but um yeah but the point is
the great leveler when it comes to that
book um what happens is you've got
explains that basically it's either
famine
Revolution or war that or a great
economic depression like the stock
market and the real estate market just
collapsing is um causes it to um crash
and yeah because the poor they're
already poor so they can't really get
any worse but the way the inequality
goes down is not because the fortune of
the poor get better but it's because the
fortunes of the rich just get a lot
worse so I don't and I did a whole video
about inequality not necessarily being a

[03:02]
about inequality not necessarily being a
problem uh I recommend watching that for
more context about this um so that is um
kind of the answer to that question um
how would you go about discussing
inherence um that's a tough question I
mean this is something first need to
talk about with your parents before you
talk about it with um
house because if you don't
um have an idea what your inheritance is
it's hard to bring that up but generally
inheres are
protected if from divorce they're
usually exempt from going into like AER
State most jurisdictions so it's that is
one but I'm a state attorney so don't
really quote me on that

[04:00]
really quote me on that
um so it definely have trust set up like
I just help one of my family members get
her trust all set up in touch with the
state friend of mine and kind of got
that handled and so that's step one and
step two is that you have to basically
tell them like you cannot plan your
budget around your
inheritance that's a mistake which I
think a lot of Millennials are making
or whether they knowingly or not knowing
is like look look I'll get an
inheritance by a certain age and that
will help make up for my lack of savings
or my lack of income at this point in my
life and first of all there's a
longevity Factor if you are somebody
who's going to expect a sizable
inheritance it means that your parents
are likely going to live longer and
because of that um you have um

[05:01]
what when it because of the fact that
your parents are likely to live longer
it means you're not going to get your
inheritance as fast as you would expect
and honestly I would rather have my
parents live longer than get an
inheritance earlier because like the
connection and the FI and the familial
bonds and just having the experience of
having your parents in your life and and
be good Grand parents and hopefully
great grandparents is worth more than
any amount of money in my opinion but
that might be just going into the um
morals of it but on top of that though
if you have longer living parents
they're more likely to have a medical
condition eventually that's going to
require a very expensive level of
treatment or they're going to need
retirement care whether at a retirement
home or hiring help to move into their
property and that can burn a lot of cash
too and then there's also a greater risk
the longer you're parents live that you

[06:00]
the longer you're parents live that you
outlive they outlive their Investments
anyway so you're not going to get as
much as you think so don't budget around
inheritance but if you are expecting one
it's something you probably should
disclose before you get married but it
is a tough subject to bring up the other
thing too is you need to iron things out
with your siblings if you have a bad
relationship with your brothers or
sisters that is probably the worst thing
you can have when it comes to issues of
an inheritance so
so you if if that is the case you're
going to have to prepare for finding the
right state attorney to represent you
because it's going to go to litigation
if you don't iron out your familial
issues with your siblings before or talk
to your parents and make sure that they
write an ironclad will and trust that
cannot be broken from legal
finagling um again I'm not an estate
attorney so if you need help with these
B things please hire an estate attorney

[07:00]
B things please hire an estate attorney
and as of the um your general
disclosures like this is not investment
advice or anything please do your
research and for the dating type stuff
look I'm a guy who's never been married
in his 30s so take what I say and
anything with that with a heavy heavy
grain of salt um I generally think that
dating advice should be people should be
restricted to really people who are in
happy marriages are the ones who know
more about that kind of thing um the
next question um I have
here and let's see I'm going to go with
the ones that
um let's see if I had any pre questions
I did save the
um
okay how do you respectfully bring up a
prenup to your partner well you have to
just mention like look I have certain

[08:00]
just mention like look I have certain
I if you have a business or some real
reason to have one you just once you
tell them what you have and disclose
your financials you say hey look um
especially if you grew up with a family
member who's been divorced it's a lot
easier to explain like the reasons you'd
be concerned if you're both of you are
from happily married families and have
no issue with that that actually
ironically less trauma makes this harder
because they'll be like why are you
concerned whereas if you are from a
family who has issues of marital failure
then it's more Justified
but um you just I just say you you just
have to bring it up as part of their
financial assets and say hey look I
don't want to be in a marriage where one
person is incentivized financially to
break it um I want to be a team with you
and that like I want to make sure that
there's no skin in the game but you have
to also be fair you can't propose a prup
that will leave the other person Des
itude and you can't really split

[09:01]
itude and you can't really split
postmarital assets unequally either
because that's just not really fair or
that's going to cause a
um a Discord in your relationship and
rightfully so because they will think
that look you're trying to plan the
escape hatch before you're already
married so it's a very difficult and
careful conversation and um yeah that's
kind of my take on that and I'm coming
from the perspective of a financial
adviser not necessarily from the
perspective of somebody who's had to go
through this um will Prop 13 get
repealed what which politicians are
willing to fall on the sword for that
won't that drastically devalue home
prices um I mean I think a lot of the
progressive left wouldn't be willing to
do that because they'll say it's a bunch
of old rich people and inherited wealth
who own all the property so that's
already been gotten rid of in the sense

[10:00]
already been gotten rid of in the sense
that you can't inherit um the cost basis
for anybody who died after
2019 and I just think that we'll just
chip around at the edges over the years
especially as California's fiscal crisis
gets worse I think the Catalyst really
for Prop 13 going away isn't some sort
of electoral movement it's more the fact
when um you see two down years in a row
in the NASDAQ 100 and you no longer have
the capital gains taxes um Revenue
coming in from tech stocks and that
revenue is going to have to be made up
from somewhere and I think Prop 13 um is
where I think it's gonna ultimately have
to come from so and I think with that
that is all the pre um internet failure
questions and by the way everybody um
thank you for sticking around despite
all the um technical difficulties we've
had I'm going to have this live go a
little bit longer for you guys to make
up for it because

[11:00]
up for it because
yeah I don't really want Unis out but um
the next question I've got here is um
and I don't understand
um what's it
called can you get an opinion on how to
properly apply the hii index and
calculate fragmented markets um I
watched my video hhi in three minutes
and I think the formula is on there
basically just a measure of
concentration if it's below a c like a
thousand it's a competitive market if
it's above like 2,800 it's a very
uncompetitive Market but it's not really
the Beall and all of how competitive an
industry is because you may have a bunch
of companies in a similar industry but
they all do different things so it might
be b a mini monopolies instead of really
just a truly competitive
market um

[12:00]
market um
won't Prop 13 just increase private
Equity buying
power no I mean private Equity still has
to private Equity it actually would
decrease private Equity buying power
because the only reason why it makes
sense for private Equity to buy real
estate as if the yield on rent is higher
than the bond market net of anything
else of everything else like if you take
out property taxes take out repair
and eviction costs or any of the other
expenses involved with owning real
estate you need to um it needs to be
higher enough yield than than a bond
market and there's only only one time
where this really made sense and that
was in the Zer era when you had and
after operation twist and a bunch of
other measurements from the FED which
caused people to be super bullish on

[13:00]
caused people to be super bullish on
bonds
um and um so that is
um the um the question that I would have
is
um I think
that right now the treasury bond market
like the average um yield of maturity is
like over
4% and that also excludes state in local
income taxes too so if you're in like a
place like California high State local
income tax you even need a higher yield
to justify buying that property so um
like for say for example the net on a
city like San Diego net of of your of
all your expenses you get a cap of like
two why would you buy the apartment
building or the house in San Diego when
your bond yield is over double what
you're eff rent yield is that's why like

[14:01]
you're eff rent yield is that's why like
I'm not really afraid of people like
Black Rock and private Equity buying all
of the real estate
because you have you can get much higher
yields in the bond market without doing
any work like being a institutional
landlord has is a business it's a job
you have expenses it's a lot of work and
effort and energy going into it uh and
unlike um what's it called on the
individual level Institution can't
really lever as much and as low rates as
people who buy less than like four units
so like it doesn't really increase the
buying power it would make property more
affordable for smaller buyers whether
it's individual homeowners or smalltime
Real Estate Investors who are buying
units uh buil properties of four units
or less uh yeah I mean will the overall
expense of housing like go down maybe
not because the gains and tax taxes
might be equally offset by Price

[15:00]
might be equally offset by Price
declines but I don't think that
institutional investors win in fact
they're probably one of the bigger
losers from the removal of Prop
uh let's see would would a relationship
ever bring you to another city if so
where would you live um I don't think
people should move like generally solely
for romantic
purposes uh you have to figure out it
has to be your overall quality of life
thing like and I'm not GNA really get
into my personal life too much when it
comes to this but um yeah if IID picked
a move out of um or Southern California
it would be for other reasons maybe just
because I think either no matter even
how successful my business goes if
property prices remain going super high
and they just don't come down and the

[16:00]
and they just don't come down and the
economic gravity then I just might not
be worth it to raise a family from a
financial perspective U that I might or
um if my say like my family all moves
away maybe I would but I really don't
see myself leaving where I live just
because I have a lot of social family
business ties and um I like the weather
and the quality of life where I live so
I don't like if you move someplace
solely just for dating opportunities and
you don't find that special someone and
you don't like anything else about the
city that's just a recipe for disaster
and misery in my opinion I mean you
should you could always visit a place
for extended periods of time and you
could always and if you don't think the
PE that you could find the right
romantic partner because there are
certain cities like if you're a
conservative person in San Francisco or
if you're a progressive person living in
a more conservative part of the US s
just a more socially restricted country

[17:01]
just a more socially restricted country
in the world you might need to go to
other places but if you find someplace
you should have a plan that like by a
certain time period to decide whether
you want to live in your city or their
city and map it out so you can hopefully
lead to a longer term
relationship but that's my thoughts on
that um
yeah um I'm not really the one to ask
about high professional females love
life is since I'm not one of them but
that's interesting
comment uh let's see let's go scroll
through some of the
um the comment
questions um that I've got here

[18:00]
all right um looks like I oh that's why
it's only top chat I gotta open up the
everything now I will see
it um should parents encourage
traditional career path like Finance law
or let children choose their
own um yeah if I missed your comment on
the last video and it's a relevant
question just please repost it here I
think I got most of them and I already
answered them earlier on this live but
yeah when it comes to um choosing that
your kids I mean it depends on your
financial situation and their financial
situation I would recommend in general
you should if your kids are going to
um to to school or
university that
um you should um maybe put restriction
on Majors if they don't have a defined

[19:02]
on Majors if they don't have a defined
plan with what they're going to do with
it like if it's a major financial
hardship for you to pay for your kids
college you have a right to have an
impact on what they study if you're
paying the bills and they could be able
I think people should choose whatever
career they want but they should study
something worthwhile in case if like the
dream path doesn't work out until they
have some skill set to fall back on
that's kind of my view on it like you
can't really force people to be a
profession they don't want to be they're
going to either resent you or they won't
be that good at it because they just
don't have the motivation or they'll
fail out like my family tried to push me
to be an attorney but I had no desire to
be an attorney so I didn't bother to
take the LSAT or study for law school
and I just told them I ran the numbers
on it and explained them like
look real pay for lawyers has declined
by significant amount since the late 80s

[20:01]
by significant amount since the late 80s
um I don't really have much of a passion
or an interest of being a lawyer so stop
trying to push it on me for your own
reasons I'm gonna pursue my career in
finance there are practical things I can
do with it and uh they dropped it so
that's kind of like an example right
there I don't think I think you should
be consider it that like hey look this
path might be a dead end um if you're
like I would recommend sending somebody
to college just to get a major that
doesn't have any application it also
depends where you go to school if you go
to like an Ivy League school who cares
what your major is it doesn't really
matter but for Less prestigious schools
you have to be more cognizant about that
because of the way employers view that
degree
um
yeah what's it called the next one is
how do um professional men doctors
Bankers Etc manage their Partners a lot
of money in very little time uh it

[21:01]
of money in very little time uh it
really depends because there's different
men with different goals like some men
don't really want a serious relationship
and they will use their busyness as an
excuse to avoid it there are
others who do want a serious
relationship and they will use the extra
resources and the busyness to filter
people out um like you the thing the
main difference I would say of somebody
like that is I think in the professional
classes and I'm going to talk about this
in the video at least on Sunday um
they're not as trust trusting as like
typical middle class professionals are
uh they're not high class enough that
they're GNA have marry people for
strategic reasons like in terms of like
your family can help me with this and my
family can help you with that that's
more like the very upper classes do that
kind of thing but
they're going to be I think that the

[22:01]
they're going to be I think that the
professional classes that you're
mentioning I think and I this applies to
women too um are going to be more aware
of intentions and they're gonna like be
like why do you want to be with me
especially as a man it's like do you
want to date me just because you want a
certain lifestyle or would you have been
attracted to me even if I had no money
um especially if it's like a nerdier guy
who did not maybe get very many women
when he was younger um and then starts
to make money and they start to come a
little and he gets a little bit more
success dating he's going to constantly
be questioning um does this person like
me for me
and that kind of belief is what is going
to win I think his heart over will be
like is that if he can prove or she can
prove or he can prove one way or the
other that they're together for the
right reasons and she's not trying to
get a lifestyle from it um because and
also I think those people are going to
be more adamant on prenups
that's the other I think difference too

[23:01]
that's the other I think difference too
because they have a lot more to lose in
a relationship like I said in my video
and I think it's going to elaborate a
future I think the middle class have the
easiest time for true love relationships
because they both have an equal amount
of skin in the game like they both have
high paying enough jobs that they're
self-sufficient and not
um not dating for those kind of reasons
but at the same time neither of them
have enough to lose that like
it they that they would be able to trust
each other better it's just more I'd say
pure in that way uh the next question
yeah a lot of successful men are
avoidant yeah that's probably true and
it's probably the a lot of the avoidant
fears is what drove them to be
successful because a lot of people who
are very successful because they didn't
feel like they had enough
selfworth uh growing up that they're
intrinsically that they needed to have
some sort of success to say like hey I'm
actually matter in

[24:00]
actually matter in
society uh how do date old money from
established class or even new money from
the counter Elite from either a middle
class or a poor guy like Dan Humphrey
from Gossip Girl I've never seen the
show Gossip Girl I know my lot of my
sisters I've talked about it in other
women in my life as use it as an example
but
um the um the thing is is that if you
want it depends what you want if you
want true love you're better off dating
plus or minus one class from you if it's
two classes or more Gap there's
definitely a control element there um so
you will have to accept being
subservient if you want to date that
much up the
ladder I don't and you're gonna have to
probably you're that's that's kind of
the deal you have to have some sort of
social currency that the other one wants
and be able to maintain that and it's
not just money necessarily it's
definitely money the classing it's but

[25:01]
definitely money the classing it's but
that's how it looks like I mean U the
best way to do that is go to Universe if
you want a more genuine relationship is
probably just to go to university with
those people if you're around both
around College age uh but yeah that's
kind of my thoughts on that and yeah
most romcoms do appear to middle class I
think they're more upper middle class A
lot of them but that is a um a good
point uh
what is your opinion on the recent
rollups and Acquisitions going on the
commercial and residential services
industry well it makes sense because a
lot of Boomers are retiring and their
kids may not want to inherit it or they
may not have kids to inherit it and so
you might as well get something for your
business instead of nothing when you're
in retirement and shutting it down and
so there's a lot more sellers than there
are buyers and so that's what the peel
these rollup strategies is because if
fol you
have a bunch of these in the same town

[26:00]
have a bunch of these in the same town
say like a dry cleaning business for
example it's probably some economies of
scale running 10 dry cleaning businesses
all in one city versus just one dry
cleaning
business and
so buying them too also has a built-in
customer base so you don't have to open
your own second or third locations and
Market it that way so that is um the um
the other example really is you can have
roll like that's so I think there is
something but you have to look at the
numbers on it I don't think it as easy
as some people are pitching it on the
Internet or in financial
conferences uh if it was it would have
happened a time ago in my opinion but
that's um the uh the example uh the next
thing is
um do you have any general advice for or
an engineer in the field of electrical

[27:00]
an engineer in the field of electrical
power or Electronics is there any hope
to have eight kids and big enough of a
house for them is two kids the max
nowadays
realistically um if I was in the
electrical engineering specialty I would
try to Tater my skills the most possible
towards um
robotics like I think there's a lot of
opportunities to be had in developing
robotics to replace a lot of manual
labor and domestic help like I did a
whole video last year about mobile loha
like this robot that can like cook eggs
and full laundry and things that Google
and Stanford are working on I there's
several other companies that are going
to build it Rosie is coming and if you
can be involved in have everybody the
process of everybody having the Rosie
the robot from the Jetson in their house
there's probably a lot of money to be
made I would learn those skills and then
partner up with a good business
development person to start a startup in
that space um yeah the next question is
uh
is it hope to have eight kids and big

[28:01]
is it hope to have eight kids and big
enough for a house for them it depends
where you live to be quite honest you
could buy a house that is big enough for
them you can uh you could also build one
too but if you're gonna have that big of
a family you're gonna have to live
probably in a more rural or exurban area
because like in in a big city there's
just probably simply not going to be a
place big enough unless you don't mind
having all your kids share rooms like I
grew up in a family of five I'm the
oldest of five siblings so I kind of
have some experience with um big
families to be Qui and like you could
fit in a 2500 to 3,000 squ foot house
with a five kid family and there's
plenty of those options if you wanted to
the big expense for that is again what
city you live in and also sending them
all to college so I think if you
depending on your income
and how much like certain conveniences

[29:01]
and how much like certain conveniences
like look if you have five kids you're
not gonna be able to travel to Europe as
much as you did if you a single person
that's or or you're gonna have some
other luxuries you're gonna have to cut
but it can be done I know a lot of
people from five six seven eight nine
children families just from the Catholic
Community locally here in Southern
California and they all managed to make
it work somehow I personally wouldn't
have more than five children just
because there's logistical problems like
most cars have a maximum capacity of
like seven to eight people so if you
want to have two parents five kids and
you space for luggage or friends or a
dog it's just very difficult to
transport people and then hotel rooms
and a lot of for vacation and air
tickets um yeah I think it gets really
complicated you'll have to have like
these certain Vans I've seen them a lot
in town that like that you can fit like
they're like almost like mini versions
of party buses in a way that you can fit

[30:00]
of party buses in a way that you can fit
like eight people and have four rows in
them but it's it's a more expensive but
if you really want to dedicate for it
you can do it yeah the ram transport fan
that's what I was trying to um to
mention um but yeah so that's
um what's it called um the next question
I had so that hopefully that answers
your
question um
okay so next question I have is what do
you think about having Independent
Insurance Brokerage um I mean I've seen
I've met plenty of people who have done
that and have worked for them so I mean
it really depends what kind of insurance
you're providing and um how good of a
salesperson you are it's it's like
running an independent insurance
brokerage is essentially like a sales
type profession and if you're good at
sales you can make a lot of money doing
it uh but yeah I personally am not

[31:01]
it uh but yeah I personally am not
involved in the insurance industry but
I've known plenty of people who have
been successful doing it and it if
you're an entrepreneurial person and
have good people skills and are willing
to really aggressively Network in your
community it can be a very viable um
business
um let's see
um all right next
um thing I'm going to to say is if
someone had a million net worth but
wanted to build generational wealth what
would you
[Music]
recommend um it's depends what is that
net worth in your residence or is that
liquid and also where do you live and a
variety of other things but um well and
also what age like if you're like one
mill like let's say you
realistically you can double that money
every 10 years if you had the help of a
good advisor or if you had a good or or
you had an upward trajectory in the

[32:00]
you had an upward trajectory in the
market um like there's no guarantee but
like the rule of 72 and you get 7% a
year you're probably going to double it
a little over seven years on average um
but even if you do that that's probably
by the time um that fortune does become
a $10 million Fortune 10 million
probably won't go as far due to
inflation and so as a result um that's
not enough
if you really want to make truly
generational wealth which is like the 20
million Liquid Plus a paid off property
you're going to have to start some kind
of business and you can use some of that
million dollars to finance the initial
Capital to starting that business and
what that business is really depends on
someone else um so well it depends on
personality and variety of other
variables so that's kind of my opinion
on that
um all right next question is there a

[33:00]
um all right next question is there a
certain Financial threshold you'd want
to cross for marriage and having kids
well I mean again I think the same one I
talked about with dating in the last
video you want to have enough money plus
12,000 a year above break even before
starting dating because your income's
going to grow as you get older and you
work hard in your career so I wouldn't
really you can't expect the income you
have now to be what you have to live off
of your entire life that's a kind of a
cynical depressing kind of view so and
also if you get too rich you're going to
have to as I mentioned with the
professionals issue um you're going to
worry about intentions and so I don't
it's not necessarily like I don't like
the idea of saying like oh you got to
become a millionaire before you can
consider dating because that just brings
out its own set of
problems but yeah for marriage it's just
that I would say that we have your you
have like you meet the right person and

[34:02]
have like you meet the right person and
you figure out a financial plan together
and you're sustainable enough that like
you're not going you're not like several
a few paychecks away from being
destitute and you can have the kids when
it makes sense like most people feel
like they like and again I'm not an
expert on any of this but um when you
can afford to buy a house that's when
you should have your second child that's
kind of the like a Ru a rule of thumb
but you can have you can live in an
apartment or a small play town home with
with one kid maybe even two but if you
want a bigger family I'd say the number
is really when you can afford to buy a
house um to have two three plus children
um and then um but yeah I wouldn't
really set a hard number on it just more
of like your career is in the right

[35:00]
of like your career is in the right
place and you have a trajectory of like
that's either more predictable or that
that will have the upside to get to
where you want to go that's kind of my
advice on
it um would you rather marry somebody
who's stable and great but a bit boring
or marry someone with a lot of passion
who gets you super fired up how do you
manage risk in
relationships
um yeah but it depends on um like I mean
that's a tough question I don't really
think I'm I think we're
really yeah I'd have to think about that
one I think that why can't you find
somebody who is a stable and great
person that is you are passionate
about like can't you have it both ways
like I just think that's kind of a false
Choice um what city
um what hot cities do you think is the

[36:00]
um what hot cities do you think is the
best for opportunity you talking about
like hot weather cities to build a
career that's the answer it's Miami and
Dallas and to a lesser degree I probably
after that would be um Charlotte and
Atlanta um in the United States uh but I
think that's the guess what is the ideal
time and age to get married if you want
to have
kids uh I don't really think anybody
should be really getting married married
before the age of say um 24 that would
be like the floor like you should be
finished with your undergrad degree
before you're married and have at least
like one year in the real world but
after that it really depends more on
meting the right person like I mean the
thing is you should probably start
looking seriously for that when you
graduate from college but it may take
some people one year to find them and it
might take others 20 years to find them
and it's hard enough to find somebody
who you'd want to be married to and so

[37:01]
who you'd want to be married to and so
if you happen to get lucky and find him
or her early um then great but like if
you meet the right person and you say oh
I need to wait till I'm 30 to get
married or need to date a certain amount
people before get married you might be
just blowing your opportunity to be
quite honest
so that is
um what's it called um my thoughts on
that is you meet the right person and
you have like your financial Foundation
generally like if you was like be more
specific like I would say ideal age for
a man to find somebody would be I don't
know anywhere from 27 to 40 but the
thing is is you've got um I don't really
I think it's when you meet the right
person more than anything and depending
of the way certain people's life paths
evolve they might meet them at the right
at different times like a lot of more
profession class people either have to
go to graduate school or they live in

[38:00]
go to graduate school or they live in
cities that may not be lined up with
their values or that they have to work
super long hours so may not they might
not get that chance until their 30s
whereas somebody who lives in a more
like low cost of living community and
maybe has a job at his family her family
business and has a more stable
trajectory then they can easily get
married younger so like it's all
dependent on your economic situation
uh speaking of cities what are your
thoughts about living in Silicon Valley
uh it seems very expensive thoughts on
salary that keep the average person col
there I actually lived in the Bay area
for a while um for my career and you
have to when you move out to a city like
that especially if you're not starting a
business you're going there for extended
education essentially you go there to
learn a certain skill
set that or meet the right connections
that will help you advance for the next
level of your career like I wouldn't

[39:01]
level of your career like I wouldn't
take living there permanently as like
the strategy unless you just really love
it like there are some people who really
love living in the Bay Area there's some
very nice um suburbs in the Bay Area
such as Los gados or um Foster City or
in a Marin area like selo or Santa um
San Rafel and
um ex and like mirinda Etc you can watch
my geography of wealth if you want to go
into details of where I think I would
live if I was going to live in the Bay
Area but the point is is that
um the um when it comes to the uh the
bay area though you have to treat it
again like extended education you're G
to go there you P probably you need to I
mean probably today's money probably at
least 130 to $150,000 a year if you're
going to move there as a single person
um Family it it's it's going to be

[40:02]
um Family it it's it's going to be
higher uh and so that is um my thoughts
about income you'd probably need uh it
also depends what stage your life you're
in like if you're just out of college
and have friends you can be roommates
with think that number is like down to a
100 if you are um somebody who's a
little older and more experienced wants
to live on their own it's it's at least
it's at least 140 but the plan really
isn't to live there your whole life it's
to meet the right connections or learn
the right skills to either move on to a
job in a city you want to live in long
term or to start a business in your
field like I liveed there and that's how
I treated my experience there I knew I
wasn't going to stay there the rest of
my life I went there as kind of an
extended education where instead of me
paying tuition I got paid to learn and
develop my skills and build my network
and it's good for that especially if you
work in technology so um and it's really

[41:02]
work in technology so um and it's really
if you're going to work in finance or
Tech or even big law or some of these
other like white shoe type professions
you generally have to spend three to
five years on one of these really
crowded big often politically left
leaning cities whether it's Los Angeles
San Francisco New York Chicago Boston DC
like you're going to have to probably
put your time in those places and it's
not your whole career but but living
three to five years in one of those
spots is not a bad idea for a young
person um hopefully that answers your
your question and if you are like and
also depends on the traffic is really
bad there too especially when you're
driving between say like SFO and San
Jose they around pal Alto is some of the
worst traffic in America so you want to
live kind of close to your work I know
some people who took the the Cal trains
all the way up and down the peninsula
but if you're working in San Francisco
you should probably live in the city or

[42:01]
you should probably live in the city or
very close by or maybe and then if
you're living in if you're working in
the Silicon Valley area I would live by
Santana Row um in San Jose or maybe um
if like or maybe Los gados if you are
more of a family or you have more money
but that's kind of my take on that um is
California in Decline and is Texas
becoming the California of the past
that's a great question um I think that
California is eventually going to
recover but I think it's kind of going
through some pains right now kind of
like what happened I think the west
coast is at risk of becoming um the next
Rust Belt and I talked about this in my
video San Francisco is the next Detroit
if you want to see more details and I
think if I had to compare the West Coast
cities like I think San Francisco was
like Detroit I think La is like Chicago
um I think LA and the surrounding areas

[43:00]
um I think LA and the surrounding areas
have the most upside and are most likely
to remain in terms of their cultural
importance and economic power in the
region kind of like
Chicago um and then um I think San Diego
is probably like Milwaukee and I would
compare like Sacramento like
Indianapolis and Seattle and Portland to
like Ohio
cities like that those are the real
risks of kind of like their trajectories
because a lot of those other cities
outside Los Angeles have way too high of
a percentage of their employment in
software development and software
related jobs and a software becomes an
industry that is more
widespread then um you're going to have
um an AI disrupts law software you're
gonna have a lot less software jobs in
the west coast and therefore the root of
their employment is going to deteriorate
even if the big tech
companies
stay um
in the um headquartered there kind of

[44:00]
in the um headquartered there kind of
like how the big three state
headquartered in Detroit they moved a
lot of the jobs out of Detroit to other
either the South or internationally and
I think you could see the same thing
with the software jobs that's a lot
easier because instead of having to
build another Factory you just rent new
office space or even have them work
remote and just say and fly out your
coders to a new city so that is kind of
my take and I think Texas yeah Texas and
Florida are the new California and the
new West Coast I think Miami Dallas
Austin
Houston and Tampa are probably all going
to be cities on the rise same with
Atlanta um Atlanta actually probably has
like the highest paying jobs relative to
cost of living which makes it relatively
attractive and I think as a result the
politics in a lot of those places is
probably going to become more blue
because it attracts a lot of younger
people from other parts whereas I think
the west coast is probably going to get
more politically read for the same

[45:00]
more politically read for the same
reasons uh but yeah I think long-term
California will always be an important
place and a successful place but they're
they're going to have some pain as the
economy is going to be forced to
restructure to become more
competitive
um Maryland has the highest mean
household incomes do you have any
thoughts well Maryland is right next to
DC and you can kind of figure out why
they may have high median household
incomes because of that
a lot of political connections the other
thing too with Maryland is also very
highly educated is one of the highest
college education rates of any states
but the cost of living is fairly high in
Maryland so like adjusted for cost of
living it's not like it's not the best
with the best bang for your
buck um and uh yeah that's kind of my
thoughts on that and what do you think
about London in the UK I did a video
about the economic future of the UK a
couple years ago when truss had her
breed um Premiership and I was pretty
bearish back then I mean I still remain

[46:02]
bearish back then I mean I still remain
pretty bearish about the UK because
outside the Financial Services
Industries their export base or like
what they offer to the rest of the world
is rather limited um they could use use
brexit to become more economically
competitive but they so far have not
been able to do that and this is a
structural problem that's gone on for
over a decade over there where they just
have very high budget deficits very high
trade
deficits and really in the post-imperial
era they don't they lack enough things
to offer to the rest of the world to
maintain their standard of living and
that's why it's been kind of a mess and
it's also
overcrowded um it's smaller as
California but it's got almost double
the population and that's creating a lot
of housing issues and social tensions as
well um maybe Britain could have its
like Awakening moment and structure its
economy but that's probably going to be

[47:00]
economy but that's probably going to be
a while um yeah and then um think gold
will hit 3K an ounce or dip before then
I don't really go into specific trade
trading advice so I'm not going to
answer that question what is the what is
your most optimistic economic future in
the US and on the contrary your most
pessimistic economic prediction for the
US watch the interview I did with Chris
about the bright economic future of the
US to get the optimistic hand but it's
just the idea that you have a lot of tax
and economic and Tech reform along with
massive technological advancements in Ai
and Robotics which just rapidly increase
the productivity and the salaries for
younger people and as a result you get
just a giant boom um the real bare case
is that let's just say um you don't like
all of these proposals that President
Trump do just completely fail and they

[48:01]
Trump do just completely fail and they
expand the deficit to the point where
you have a real fiscal crisis in the
United States that the ability to pay
its debts become at risk and then as
result you have major like austerity
where you actually have cuts to Social
Security and Medicare to the point or
government to the point where the people
react and vote a radically left-wing
government and you have FDR 2.0 that
would probably be the the bearish case
for
America um and or that
um like America just isn't able to
technologically innovate anymore for
some reason like our education system
gets super bad and or um you it's just
the entrepreneurial Vigor dies and some
other part of the world takes the lead
in technology and that's game over
really for America at that point
but I'm actually think the out the
outcome is probably somewhere in between

[49:01]
outcome is probably somewhere in between
but probably closer to the more
optimistic outcome because a lot of the
lot risk of job losses from AI are going
to be made up for through um shrinking
young people populations and like the
mass retirements of Boomers so I think
and Society will have enough time for
the for to adapt to technological
displacement of
employment um
and then opinion on Doge I don't think I
I mean I made a video about spending so
that's kind of my opinion I think doge
is doing a good thing um I think that
you've got I think that seems like the
first serious attempt to really go after
the inefficiencies and excess spending
in the government and I did a video
about balancing the budget it's still
there I don't think I've deleted it so
um yeah what do you think about
companies reincorporating Nevada and
Texas what are the drivers um I think

[50:00]
Texas what are the drivers um I think
the drivers are mainly taxes and
Regulatory and those might outweigh the
benefits of the court system in Delaware
um you generally want to incorporate
your smaller business in the
jurisdiction you live in because you're
going to have to have some sort of
entity there
anyway it's really when you get to like
very big companies where that kind of
thing
matters
um well how will the growth of female
spending power shift the dating
Market um I mean even before feminism
women were the ones who were making most
of the spending decisions because even
in traditional households a lot of men
defer their finances to women so I'm not
really as concerned the only thing is is
that you can't really compete solely on
money like the amount of money you need
to make to basically be to be attractive
solely as a provider net of any other
personality traits is a lot higher
the that's the really the only
difference

[51:02]
difference
um yeah and then um opinion on the
Donald Trump versus the United States
bureaucrat
situation well I mean I think that in
general there is plenty there's some
room we could probably cut 10% of the
government bureaucrats without really
missing a beat uh I think that the rain
risk is that he's offering this big
buyout and hopefully that encourages and
speeds up the process but the risk is
that the most competent people or the
ones who act that could actually get
jobs in the private sector are the ones
who take those bids and the people who
aren't competent are the ones who stay
so there might be a negative selection
bias with the buyout but in general I
think it's a step in the right
direction um let me just rroll up to
some of these
comments um questions that I have here
um let's

[52:02]
see how do you vet somebody for a future
romantic partner um what's it um yeah I
mean I would say really that's a very
long question but you first need to do
is write a list of what you're looking
for in advance maybe after if you had a
like and so that is um and think about
the traits that you want in terms of
like personality and what your life
goals are and just kind of have an idea
of that and then just ask certain
questions this is probably a question
that I'm not going to talk about in
public if you come to one of my fan
meetups I go more into it in in private
and speaking of that we are expanding
the tour the analyzing Finance of Nick
tour quite a bit uh our next stop
speaking of the next question what do
you think of Austin Phoenix and LA is
that Austin and Phoenix are two of the
next four stops in the analyzing Finance

[53:01]
next four stops in the analyzing Finance
with Nick tour in fact I'm going to be
next weekend in Scottdale Arizona which
is why I'm doing this live stream today
and not on actual Valentine's Day
because I will be on a plane to
Arizona uh so if you want to come and
meet me at the Arizona Meetup um
so yeah and then um here's the link and
then after that we're also to Miami on
March 1st so all you Floridians um you
want to come to Florida we have that and
then we're going to have another one in
Southern California in Newport Beach on
April 5th so um I'd love to see all the
the people there and then we're also
going to the north to Texas uh Dallas on
um the uh April 25th and Austin on April
27th and then we're having a week on the
East Northeast with New York May 10th DC
May um 17th and Philadelphia May 12th so

[54:03]
May um 17th and Philadelphia May 12th so
if you guys want to come to the tour to
these stops please register in advance I
also could use your guys' help really in
terms of finding venues in some of these
cities um depending on how many people
sign up I'm G to need something that's a
little bit bigger than just meeting
casually at a restaurant and if people
have suggestions on how that or where I
should host some of these events any
sort of referrals would be greatly um
appreciated so that's kind and the last
one I'm gonna announce is we have we're
gonna have one in in Canada too in
Calgary on June 1st so the Canadian
subscribers want to see me without
having to come to the US um I'm GNA be
in Calgary so I put all the links there
and if you your city is not included you
can vote on the form about what city you
would want to see it and we when we do
have something planned there you'll get
an email so but I just that's just a

[55:01]
an email so but I just that's just a
good segue what do I think about Phoenix
um I think Phoenix is kind of like Tampa
of the West it's doesn't H the problem
Phoenix is gonna have a lot of people
moving there because of the
weather and um it may it's relatively
low cost of living so it's going to
attract a decent amount of retirees the
problem is that they don't have that
many like major companies or core
Industries headquartered there so it's
not going to bring in like the high IQ
like really upper middle class
professional jobs like some other
metropolitan areas are um I think it's
one of my favorite places to spend in
the winter it's great for golf um but
it's kind of a place more you want to do
is either youve already made your money
or you're retired it's not really a
place you go to prove yourself or to
make it um and then Dallas I think is
going to become like the next Los
Angeles like it's it is a place where
businesses big businesses are moving
headquarters too it's a place where
deals are happening uh and it's spread

[56:01]
deals are happening uh and it's spread
out like Los Angeles and has similar
traffic dilemmas except without a beach
um and so yeah um that's kind of my
opinion on Dallas can you speak to
living in High Cost of Living USA remote
USA Switzerland is a Singapore for high
income W2 owners over the course of
their career assume average desire to
have a family
um when it comes to live um if you're a
w High income
W2 income
earner um I would say that there the tax
benefits of living in Singapore are
there uh but if you're over like the the
expat allowance like I think it's like
120,000 a year now you're still going to
be paying some federal taxes and
Singapore has a similar cost of living
to California like Coastal California
except with lower taxes just as
perspective um but they also have a work

[57:02]
perspective um but they also have a work
culture for W2 that most Americans
probably would not want like 996 like
you hear about in the news in China was
a thing when I lived in Singapore and so
if I'm a W2 I wouldn't really recommend
living there Switzerland could be nice
if your income is compensated with the
right Cola bounce if you don't get a
like a cola bounce to adjust the swits
cost of living I wouldn't go but if you
do I mean it's the one place in Europe
that I think you can actually get ahead
and so and it's a very high quality of
life I mean that's one of the places I
would that's probably is the country I
would live in the outside the US answer
this other question here would be um
Switzerland so other country and then um
but it's really
um like and high cost living Us in terms
of living in those cities it's the best
chance for career advancement
and to make good networking connections
low cost of living us is if you've

[58:02]
low cost of living us is if you've
already kind of hit your ceiling or
you're close to it you don't have to
worry about the promotion ladder anymore
lowcost living us is probably the and
you don't have Family Ties keeping you
somewhere or not as picky about climate
like me um low cost of living us is
probably your your best bet um and then
remote you have the risk that like if
there is any layoffs you're probably the
first one to go so that's the downside
really for remote us and I've mentioned
the other ones but it's really depends
on your stage of career if you're
younger earlier stage of your career um
I would do high cost living us if you
are more senior I would do low cost of
living
us favorite countries um I would live
outside the US I already mentioned
Switzerland um I also like if I already
made my money and just want to relax I'd
probably could consider the Cayman
Islands in
uguay um you get favorable tax treatment

[59:02]
uguay um you get favorable tax treatment
they're very nice beaches and pretty
good weather um there are certain Bad
season you want to get out of the cay
anding hurricane season but find some
place to go during the summer but th and
also those places kind get a little
sleepy but if again if I'm not really
looking to um if I'm a more retiree and
want a slower pace of Life those places
aren't bad and the other thing at the
factor is if you have kids about
education quality like a lot of these
countries that people want to move to
for lowc cost living may not have the
best education quality it's also the
same reason why I'm hesitant to live in
Hawaii if I had a family um so you
really want to figure out like if you
want your kids to go to Elite
universities you need to go in a you
need to live in a place that will help
set up for that and that usually means
staying in the High Cost of Living parts
of the
US um do you think that 2010s are under
rate is a great time in America homes
were very affordable especially in the
early 10s um cost living is favorable

[1:00:02]
early 10s um cost living is favorable
crime was at alltime lows um I have
mixed views because it was there were
homes were really only affordable in the
low cost of living metros the high cost
living metros they got very unaffordable
as early as
2013 and you had people complaining
about rent being more than 50% of their
income all across the West Coast as
early as
2013 um so it's not entirely true and
also wages wage growth was really bad
back then so you didn't really
have people so people didn't really have
that much disposable income even if the
cost of living was lower I really think
America has kind of been in an economic
Dark Age really since 2000 and hopefully
we now start to come out of it but the
2000s were rough 2010s were fairly rough
and the first few years of the 2020s
were probably even
were pretty bad too but I think the two
of the 2010s were probably the second

[1:01:02]
of the 2010s were probably the second
best period in the last 25 years other
than like 01 to 06 was probably the best
period in the last 25 years but it was
kind of a a bad time thoughts on
homeschooling um yeah I mean I don't
know whenever I have a family I would be
want to do something like a pod maybe
where I would team up with other local
families and we would try to
um find um like teachers that we can
hire and rent out like an office
building or something and just create
our independent school because I think
there's socialization problem if you
just have homeschooling with just your
own immediate family so you want to
incorporate other people but at the same
time the problems of the school system
and the psychological damage it does
particularly to neurode Divergent and
academic gifted kids is worse than the
socialization disadvantages of

[1:02:00]
socialization disadvantages of
homeschooling in many cases so you want
to kind of have the best of both worlds
you want to have friends and like peer
groups but you don't want to have the
toxic people that are enable with a
school of any size even if it's in a
rich um neighborhood or the the teachers
May teaching things that may not be
aligned with your that individual or
family's values so I would be advocating
something in between where you team up
or find a private school that has lined
with your C values there's a lot of
these startup type private schools
popping up here in Southern California
and I assume they are in other places
where they do cater to different
demographics of parents with different
values that you can kind of have a
school that's more established but
without the um the negative effects of
that so that's my thing is public school
actually wage slave training uh yeah I
mean many ways it is it's oh it's kind
of it's also daycare in a lot of ways

[1:03:00]
of it's also daycare in a lot of ways
for working parents who just can't have
their kids at home all the time alone so
there's a lot of other social um goals
that are derived from the public school
system um than just simply educating
people but I'm not against PGE education
because you need to have a minimum level
of Education to have a functioning
Society um like if in the in the in this
small government for this is a big
government debate kind of the line I
have like the government getting more
involved than public education is
probably where I support Cuts but then
beyond that I I generally tend to be
favor of government doing things like
that
um then um you've got um next
question
um while
Mississippi and West Virginia are the
poorest states they rank number two and

[1:04:00]
poorest states they rank number two and
homes owned outright that's just I think
a bias of the age of the people who live
there um I think a lot of younger people
don't really want to live in those
places because there's not really that
many career opportunities so the people
who live there are likely older people
who have already paid off their
mortgages and Maryland is last because I
don't think there's that many a lot
there's probably a lot of transplants
who move to the greater d
area and it's a High Cost of Living City
so that's so the most of the people
who've moved there have been within the
last 30 years or so and probably still
have mortgages to
pay did you see the whole USA spending
Fiasco yes I did and I haven't really
commented on yet because it's still kind
of playing out and I don't know if it's
really more of a analyzing politics with
Nick versus an analyzing Finance with
Nick it seems like the doge is going to
be
eliminating it based on what I've read
about it um what are your thoughts the

[1:05:02]
about it um what are your thoughts the
biggest recent mistake um that affected
the American economy post FDR well
there's a lot of them well one I think
it's um the guns and butter policy of
lynon Johnson is probably number one
where you both greatly expand the
welfare state with things like Medicare
and a lot of the welfare programs of the
60s while at the same time waging
Vietnam and that extreme level of
unsustainable deficit spending is what
led to us ultimately having to leave the
gold standard um in the in the early 70s
that's that's number one um number two I
would say um tarp and bailing out the
banks not because it was a failure of a
policy but the second order effect of
creating entitlement bailout culture has
been a major drag to society since '
08 and then
um you've got the other one would be
when Biden first passed the

[1:06:01]
when Biden first passed the
um the his first stimulus bill which
extended the UN um the amount of time
you could spend on unemployment during
the pandemic so it restricted labor
Supply and the amount of people willing
to make goods and services in the
economy when demand was rising and so it
created inflation there are other things
that F caused the inflation of this
early decade but that was a big one and
I knew from that point forward that this
was going to be Carter
2.0 uh next question where is the best
city for dating um need to move soon
looking for new career opportunities I
would move based on where your best
career opportunities are or other
personal reasons why you like a city uh
but if you really want to move just for
dating probably the best city in America
for single men is probably New York City
uh there are other reasons why you
wouldn't want to live in New York City
but just if the ratio of college
educated men versus college educated Ed

[1:07:02]
educated men versus college educated Ed
educated women um is in favor of men and
a lot of Reason a lot of young men don't
want to live there because they think
it's not worth the money to live there
and women are rather have factor into
other quality of life things like access
to culture and museums and
um walking convenience and other and
they don't care as much about just the
bottom line and that's so that's why a
lot of the northeastern cities and tend
to have more young women than young men
and Chicago has a similar Dynamic
whereas the cities that tend to attract
more younger successful men are ones
with good weather lower cost of living
and high paying jobs so that is often
California Florida uh Dallas Seattle
just the the Western half of the US
generally and so that's why um yeah
that's kind of the um so if you're
really trying to pick Metro areas based
on dating opportunities the best ones

[1:08:01]
on dating opportunities the best ones
from men are Northeast Chicago um the
ones that are the best for young women
are the Pacific Northwest and the Bay
Area
um and then um what's it called um the
next question is what are your thoughts
on having a federal mandate for
Community College to be free feel like
it'd be a huge plus to the country as a
whole um I don't really like the idea of
absolutely free college because it
creates the Van Wilder effect I don't
know if you guys are too young to see
the movie National Vons um Van Wilder
but it's the idea this guy I met a real
life version of one of these guys when I
was in college but this guy's like 25
who just stayed in University for five
six seven years because he didn't know
what to do with his life and was just
having too much fun in college and this
is happen sometimes in Scandinavian
countries too if you don't have like
some sort of economic reason to finish
on time it creates some Mal

[1:09:00]
on time it creates some Mal
incentives and so I want there to be
some sort of cost so that people are
incentivized to finish University on
time and not just waste their youth in
school permanently uh and there needs to
be a market signal to figure out which
degrees are worth taking versus which
ones aren't do I think college is too
expensive generally yes I think you
should have Community College be very
reasonably priced but it has to have a
price can't be absolutely
free um and because there's also the jco
Trap where people just keep switching
majors and just stay in junior college
for way longer than they
should uh let's see the next question I
have is um is China on a gold standard
no they are not they if they really
wanted to make the R&B replace the
dollar they probably would need to get
on one um let's
see all right

[1:10:00]
you should put a chat on the video a lot
a lot of people are getting shadowbanned
how do you know that people are getting
shadowbanned I have really no idea have
you read read the origin of wealth by
bin Hawker I really like it but I've
never seen it mentioned I've never heard
of that book if you want books are
recommended for finance I recommend
joining my substack because I have a a
um on there a guide with a like a that
as a reading list of like the top 100
books related to business and finance
and you if you join the substack the
free version you get the emailed to you
so that's where all my book
recommendations are I have over a
hundred in there uh good books on game
theory that is a good one I don't really
know any that great books on Game Theory
I learned Game Theory mainly through um
College I mean I know a lot of people on
the political right like and younger

[1:11:00]
the political right like and younger
people like to bash the valy of college
but if it wasn't from my University
experience I would have never learn I
took multiple classes related to game
theory in my undergrad and that's where
I I learned it and most of what I
learned about Game Theory since is um
reading it about it just by looking up
certain terms in Game Theory or just
looking at the world and seeing what the
incentives are built in uh so I don't
really have any books but there probably
are some good books about Game Theory I
just don't know what they are sorry um
never thought about going to politics
it's something I've debated at my
current stage of life I'm not ready to
do it I want to have um a certain other
benchmarks I want my business to get to
a certain level first that I'm not
really financially dependent on a few
donors um I also want to have a family
and children who are old enough that
they can handle the media pressure
involved with being in politics and also
my political ideology is not really
lined up well with the current um
political spectrum and I probably could

[1:12:02]
political spectrum and I probably could
not win um on in my
jurisdiction um maybe on the local level
I probably could but beyond that it
would be very difficult so it's not
something and also the minimum cost to
run a campaign has gone up that even
with my most optimistic projections for
my net worth I'd have to spend well over
50% of it to just to finance to self
finance a campaign so it's it's
something um I have to think about how
many books would you say read on average
a year a lot less than I used to and do
you count audible or not I mean if you
count audible I probably read about I
don't know 12 to 15 books a year when I
was in my 20s I Read 50 to 75 books a
year but now I'm kind of more in the
applying stage of my life
like I used to read a lot
more and now when I was in my more

[1:13:00]
more and now when I was in my more
learning phase but now all the stuff
I've learned I kind of want to actually
start applying it and so I'm learning
through doing now more than just reading
but I still read a lot I read a lot of
research reports I read a lot of random
articles or academic journals or other
things and that's how I learn because I
have I I do research for a living so of
course I'm still reading but in terms of
of like full length books I'm reading
less of them than I used
to um how many hours a day is that it's
not as much I'm a pretty fast reader so
I can knock
out like I could probably read at least
50 pages in an
hour uh so like
it's that's that really helps but um
yeah I mean I would say also in my 20s I
had a lot more free time because I
wasn't self-employed and also I was not
really into night life I still not

[1:14:00]
really into night life I still not
really into night life and so uh I use a
lot of my Friday and Saturday nights to
read all right do you think the demand
of ETFs from 401ks is a bubble of any
kind I don't think it's a bubble but it
is the driver of S&P 500 flows is a Big
Driver of valuations and if that does
reverse I talked about this in the great
wealth transfer video
there will be major um economic
implications to that so I mean it is so
there I don't know if it's going call a
bubble but the flows are supportive of
existing
valuations um let's see and yeah I I
would what is a good way to become a
macro analyst with a bachelor's degree
in a few years of a relevant work
experience um I think taking CFA level
one or something s like that to prove
that you have some base
competence um I would also put together

[1:15:01]
competence um I would also put together
some case studies so when you do apply
to these type of jobs you can show you
will know what you do it also depends
what did you study um in undergrad if
you studied Finance or business or
economics or math it'll be easier to
switch if you studied something
completely irrelevant it might be harder
U and in your in certain situations like
that it might be worth getting a top 10
NBA but yeah it's a lot more on your
specific um
position thoughts I mean I think Asia
sentiment
peaked and
so that um and Asia like does have a lot
of potential at the same time it's also
the region at the biggest risk of the AI
um ladder Pole where a lot of these
people who are getting educated for the
first time and getting new jobs on Lower
ends the value chain if they just get
completely cut out by Robotics and AI it
could lead to a lot of social dist

[1:16:00]
could lead to a lot of social dist
instability in Asia like I think
Northeast Asia will be fine and survive
in some shape or form and remain like an
important part of the global economy I
think southeast Asia and South Asia are
more at risk of being technologically
obviated um but I'm gonna do a video
about the economic future of India
probably coming up in the next few
months and um you can watch some my
other economic features videos for the
VI for the Southeast Asian countries and
Japan and China for more thoughts on
that
um yeah and then um I want to ask you I
know people who work endlessly without
any goal but only for the purpose of
work do you think that work is a means
to an end what do you think about work
colics this goes back to Max vber and
the Protestant work ethic I mean I'm
biased since I'm a Roman Catholic but I
don't really I don't really buy into the
Protestant work ethic I don't think and
I'm very gen Z on this view even though

[1:17:01]
I'm very gen Z on this view even though
I am a millennial myself where is the
idea that I don't think work for its own
sake is of any value I think idleness is
the devil's workshop and you don't
really want to be sitting around and
doing nothing but work without a purpose
is pointless like the idea of toiling
just for the sake of
toiling is it is not do not really
appeal to me whatsoever like I generally
think you shouldn't work more than 50
hours a week if you are a
W2 like it's not worth really the
additional effort um if you are
self-employed you should be working
probably 70 80 hours a week like at the
beginning at least and then scale it
down when you've gotten things off the
ground but I understand if you're
self-employed you should be working or
you have some other higher cause like if
there's a real reason for what you're
doing work hard we want people who have

[1:18:00]
doing work hard we want people who have
real motivations and intrinsic causes
and things they want to do or if there's
or if your reward is getting compensated
proportionately like if you putting in
the extra hours is going to make your
business grow a lot faster um it's worth
doing or if you feel a lot more reward
from this like this channel even though
it's more of like a hobby for me I get a
lot of value emot
and um personally from doing this and so
as a result it's
worthwhile but to work for its own
work's sake I I disagree with this what
social class would a military strategist
be well I just I generally think most of
the military is middle class um they
have one single employer which is the
government and they make enough that
they can save for a retirement at a
normal age but not really generational
wealth maybe if you're a private
contractor who runs a military strategy
business as a business owner you might

[1:19:00]
business as a business owner you might
be in the in the professional or self
employed class or the successful
business owner classes but I generally
think the military is mostly middle
class um the future of college in 20 or
years um I think that the future of
college is
um it's mixed I mean I think that
with like modern digital technology you
can have one Professor teach lots of
more people at scale so um but I think
that college will still be useful for
socialization it'll be still useful for
networking the concentration of so many
different ideas and types of classes and
activities in one place helps young
people figure out what they actually
want to do with their life but I think
the business model of college is at risk
and I think college is going to get more
affordable that's the one thing it's
already start it already peaked College
costs relative to the CPI basket peaked
right before the pandemic and as the

[1:20:02]
right before the pandemic and as the
enrollment Cliff happens and there's
less young people going into the
colleges and you see possible reforms of
the department education which makes
government back student loans less
accessible um I think you're going to
see a spike in terms of um affordability
going down and I mean going up sorry
it'll be but price is going down and
you'll also see it easier to get into
schools outside the ivy league and the
UC system because there will be more
slots open for the same amount of
students so yeah I think some of the
more marginal smaller schools um are
probably at risk of going under but yeah
I think that um College will become more
affordable uh I think all right another
I think high school should just extend
to 15 to 20 I I think that's a bad idea
I think High School school is
psychologically damaging to a lot of
people and if anything we should try to
finish High School quicker and just have

[1:21:00]
finish High School quicker and just have
a gap year before going to
college
um let's see um other comment that I'm
going to bring out before I go to other
questions um the other debunking the
Doomer that I'm going to release for
members only is debunking the Doomer on
hypergamy and I I want if it's too edgy
let me know do you guys want to see that
but it's probably a member only video um
the other thing I wanted to mention too
um
is that we are also I forgot for one
other tour stop we're gonna actually
have one we're gonna have four stops in
Europe in late August and early
September for the so my European people
who are viewing this uh we will be
having four cities one in Switzerland
one in Italy and two others there are to
be determined based on your guys' votes
and my travel schedule the one we have
confirmed is September of 5th in Rome

[1:22:02]
confirmed is September of 5th in Rome
this part of Catholic Jubilee so if
Italian viewers can help me find a venue
or want to meet up feel free to register
I look forward to seeing you guys or
people traveling to Rome for Jubilee if
you're not Italian um and um the other
thing was also I have set up a official
Instagram for the channel if you guys
want to connect with me that way
and we also have an official Discord for
the channel if you want to keep these
conversations going amongst yourselves
when I am not available because I can't
talk to you guys live 24 hours a day but
we now have a Discord as well if you
guys want to join and chat in there I'm
gonna post the
link in here and a now after those
updates let's check back to questions do
you think that the us and that the
habitual um dangling of chasing to some
degree of unrealistic status is

[1:23:00]
degree of unrealistic status is
unhealthy versus the European model of
having a more balanced
lifestyle um I can look at it both ways
like the ambition and is what creates
the economic growth and the opportunity
in America and if it wasn't for that and
we were more like Europe you would just
have a
um a just a stagnant economy and there
would be no place for people to go if
they want to Advance America is
fortunately a country that allows for
social Mobility most of the world does
not and you can watch my class
structures of each region of the world
if you want to see that and so I would
say yeah I think it's actually the the
down you just have to be emotionally
mature and psychologically aware enough
of these pressures so that you don't
ruin your life because of it that's more
of an individual
decision um yeah and then do you think
there's a difference between hypergamy
and gold digging yeah because social
status is not and social currency is not

[1:24:01]
status is not and social currency is not
just money and power and Status it can
be looks based it can be having a
certain personal personality type that
is considered more attractive it can be
having certain life experiences that
make you more interesting so it's not
purely a um a monetary thing and
thankfully it's not a purely a monetary
thing because otherwise it would
probably be a crer and colder of a world
um also how would you summarize the
economics of dating in 2025 from a man's
perspective um I mean there's a lot
that's there's a lot in that question um
yeah I mean it depends where you live
and a variety of other things but men
just have to be factoring finances
somewhat because like if you want even
if you're somebody with a lot of um
uh options say for example um you can't

[1:25:01]
uh options say for example um you can't
you don't have the time necessarily and
the money to date all of them so you
have to be um very deliberate so that
you can sustainably meet enough people
that you can find somebody who fits but
not go broke in the process or get jaded
in the process because emotional capital
is just like like Financial capital and
I think a lot of problems with dating in
modern world is that people get too
jaded because they've had too many bad
experiences or not enough good experien
to make up for it and then there's the
adverse selection problem with the
people who are more likely to be good
relationship Partners happen to be in
good relationships I did a video about
this uh several years ago called adverse
selection which I'll read reposting on
Valentine's Day in the post section but
I think that's really the most common
theme for dating 2025 for a man is how
to deal with adverse selection because

[1:26:00]
to deal with adverse selection because
that's a real issue like it's f is
screening for Quality um yeah in what
time frame do you think China becomes
the world's largest economy could it
happened before
2030 it depends well the problems we'll
never know because we don't know how
accurate the economic numbers are in
China
like yeah if if if they're growing
really at 10 five to 10% like they've to
the last 40 years it could happen easily
by
2030 if they're not then they
can't and then um the uh the other
dilemma really too is on top of that is
how do you measure their PPP like are
you talking about nominal or purchase
power par because uh a lot of countries
will use a AR unrealistic lowcost living
assumption to make the purchase power
multiple look greater to make their
economy seem to look better so the

[1:27:00]
economy seem to look better so the
answer really is we won't even know if
it happen when it
happen and speaking of people have
mentioned that the Discord link is not
working so I'm G to try to create at
least a temporary one for this
stream to
um to invite all you guys
in um just give me a second while I do
that all right so I copied here's
another one that work at least for
within seven days of this if you guys
want to hop on um let's see with wom
holding 62% of degrees how would you
consider college educated women dating a
professional um that's really up to them
like like there's a there's a certain
bias want people more
educated
but like there are plenty of people who
are don't have a college education who

[1:28:01]
are don't have a college education who
make more money than those who are
college educated and they might be able
to make for it in other ways is there a
new establishment Elite in America um
the answer is
possibly um like what musk is doing um
and Trump with their recent Ascension is
that they might be dislodging the
existing establishment Elite at least in
the political class and replacing it
with a new one probably on the back of
tech entrepreneurs and Tech CEOs and so
be in the process of a
realignment of the elites and I might
make a video about this but um it's kind
of too early for me to say whether it's
already happened but it looks like we
might be in the process of as Le Elite
shakeups generally happen once every 50
years or so like the last one we really
had was like in the 60s and 70s
so um yeah that's my answer to that

[1:29:01]
so um yeah that's my answer to that
question
um let's
see and then
um what's what else do we have here I'm
gonna scroll back because I missed a
bunch of
questions and if I miss yours then I
miss my run out of time let's see
because there's a lot of them they asked
when I was answering
these um

[1:30:00]
all right the EU dropped tariffs on
American cars from 10 to 2% what's two
and a half what are your thoughts on
this well my thoughts on this are this
is Europe trying to um prevent Trump
from getting them involved in a trade
War so they're conceding
early um do I think that on the margin
America will sell more cars to Europe
because of this yeah um do I think that
American cars are going to become super
popular in Europe because of a just a
tariff cut probably not because most of
America's car Fleet is like very large
SUVs and pickup trucks which if you've
ever been to a European city they may
have no room to park those things and a
lot of the garages and the
infrastructure is designed for smaller
cars so I don't really maybe maybe
that's the like the trendy thing is that
Euro culture is going to embrace pickup
life but I just I don't really see that

[1:31:00]
life but I just I don't really see that
happening but yeah I think it will mean
more Auto exports from the US to Europe
and Trump will less likely to go after
them because he sees that they're making
a deal and Europe relies more on them
selling European cars in America than
the other way around particularly
Volkswagen Mercedes in
BMW
um what about the British class system
and how it relates the American class
system and the European one well I think
it's a hybrid but I think the British
class system is closer to the European
ones and the Americans um the difference
with because the British one is the same
people from since the first English
Revolution really and even earlier some
people some of the people own land in
London date back to William the
Conqueror it has a little bit of more
social Mobility historically on paper
and and especially because they were
able to export a lot of the discontent
people who wanted to move up classes to

[1:32:00]
people who wanted to move up classes to
their colonies but they still
fundamentally have a class system that
is more determined based on birth and
connections than on Merit the only
really industry they have that can
really move up on Merit is the financial
industry and on top of that they do use
a relatively generous social welfare
system and to Plate the lower classes
enough not to Rebel so it's a similar
model I think it's closer to the
European uh system to be honest
um but let's see next question that I
have
um on here
um what are your thoughts on unscripted
by MJ DeMarco uh it's a good book um

[1:33:01]
by MJ DeMarco uh it's a good book um
I've read it um several years ago I also
read the millionaire fast lane about
seven years ago when I first started my
own business and I generally agree with
a lot of MJ DeMarco philosophies on this
I do think um that he is a little bit
off on political things I think that
political changes actually do have
material effects he was right if like
when he wrote those books in the 90s and
the
2000s that he was right that like both
parties are fairly moderate it didn't
really matter and you shouldn't but like
with more radical policy proposals
actually being enacted it does make some
sense to pay attention to those but
really um apart from that I I I it's one
of my favorite books about
entrepreneurship especially from a
mindset perspective unscripted I've read
it multiple times times I've get
recommended it to other people so yeah I
think that's a good book is this the

[1:34:02]
think that's a good book is this the
um age of techn feudalism um I have read
Yannis far Foxx's book and listen to his
interviews on this I think Giannis vacus
actually is a very interesting Economist
if I wanted an economist with a who I
respect intellectually but has a lot of
different views on me to come on the
channel I think jannis far Fox would be
one of my first choices so if any guys
know Giannis or can make an intro I'd
love to have him on analyzing Finance
with Nick uh his idea for those you who
are not familiar with it is that we live
with the original feudalism was where
you had a concentrated ownership of land
particularly farm land and the main
beneficiaries of economic output were
the land owners because most of the
costs were the rents that went back to
the land owners the second one is
capitalism where instead of owning land

[1:35:01]
capitalism where instead of owning land
the main thing to own was Capital which
is usually um factories or other
physical means of production but it
could also be Capital Equipment it could
be intellectual property um software Etc
and so those who own the capital got the
disproportionate gains and output of the
economy
and
then the third thing that is now what um
V Fus would argue is the um what's it
called the techn feudalist world where
instead of capital being where the
wealth is capital has become
increasingly commoditized due to global
access to Credit in the financial
markets and along with just people
building factories all over the place
and cheap manufacturing overseas has
really reduced that as a bottleneck so

[1:36:03]
really reduced that as a bottleneck so
now the main thing is access to a
platform and the internet has made
people be allowed to do business with
anybody really anywhere and but however
a lot of the internet is concentrated on
a few platforms and those who pay the
fees of the platforms are the ones who
get the disproportionate benefits of the
economy so say for example if you want
to watch like independent content on the
internet that's video for you come here
to
YouTube and I may be producing this
content and I do get paid somewhat but
Google gets them a big chunk of it as
their rent for maintaining the platform
or Amazon if you want to you could sell
any product any manufacturer can list
their product on Amazon but Amazon gets
a B cut without having to produce
anything they just charge you the rent
of being on their platform and it could

[1:37:00]
of being on their platform and it could
be the same with um AI platforms or it
can be the same with digital advertising
and meta on social media and that's what
V foxus things we live in a world now
that if you can own the few people who
own these platforms where everybody
exchanges business or goes to do a
certain thing
digitally uh they are the new um barrons
they are they're like the people who own
real Capital don't get the same
valuations on their stocks as the people
who own these platforms because they're
theoretically have infinite scalability
without having to put any physical
capital in it so they can have much
higher profit margins and yeah and it's
it's more efficient for it to do it this
way because if everybody's on one
platform it's easier to have a more
efficient market and find everybody
versus um having to go to a bunch of
different platforms for AUST different
things which makes the market more dis
intermediary the risk is that is that
too much power is going into the
concentration of these few big

[1:38:01]
concentration of these few big
technology companies and holders and you
see like the S&P like over 35% of it is
in the Magnificent 7 tech companies and
so that's what VAR focus is explaining
are we in a techn Fu Society um I don't
like giving this answer all the time but
it seems like that's been the answer is
maybe um I think inevitably there will
be some other disruptive technology that
commoditized or
um disrupts these or if it gets bad
enough the antitrust authorities will
get in and force a breakup or require or
lower fees for the communities or
there's the idea that's more on the
radical left side of things is that you
turn these platforms into
utilities where the producers pay like a
relatively fixed amount that is the cost
of maintaining the natural monopoly with
like a fixed power Mar a profit margin
and therefore the gain the economy go
back to the people who are actually
creating the transactions or the content
creators or whoever um that would like

[1:39:02]
creators or whoever um that would like
the example of natural monopoly in the
real world is like an electric company
like it doesn't make economic sense to
have competing
companies um build
um a um what's it called to build a a
power plant in every like multiple power
plant every city like like if there was
like 20 different utilities for you to
give you electricity then nobody would
build a power because the fixed costs of
building a power plant and the grid and
all the connections are so expensive
that you wouldn't have any viable
um like Electric System people wouldn't
bother to build it because there
wouldn't be a return on investment
because of competition and so what we do
in the society is we have natural
monopolies where the government will
permit a monopoly for utilities and in
exchange they have a maximum a cap on

[1:40:02]
exchange they have a maximum a cap on
their profit margins and so they can't
and they have caps on whether they how
much they can raise their rates because
if you give somebody Monopoly without
those kind of
restrictions you have a um you'll have
abuse and so that's how we manage things
like water infrastructure and
electricity and cable fiber otic cable
or cable TV and internet or all these
natural
monopolies and maybe
some advocate of yan Yannis foxus say
techn feudalism is going to say hey wait
you know what why aren't these internet
companies just the new digital form of
natural monopolies like it doesn't make
sense to build a plat all these
platforms all over the place and the
marketing spend is so high Uber could be
another one example why don't we just
allow say like uber to be the Monopoly
for ride share but then we have to give

[1:41:00]
for ride share but then we have to give
them the same kind of regulations as a
utility um and this would also like the
Free Speech argument too is like the
these companies had a pre um musk
acquiring X were
disproportionately um allowing speech
really from only one side of the aisle
and were abusing their deao Monopoly
powers and now if not and that was the
argument was to turn them into utility
was so that they could not use selective
enforcement of comment
moderation um but yeah that's um that's
my thoughts I know it's kind of a long
explanation
but um that's my thoughts on that um
yeah and then the other thing is what's
the real reason why Elon wants the
bureaucracy weakened to see them as a
threat to is increasing class's power
no I mean there could be a few things
one I think he had had a legitimate
political Awakening and that happened

[1:42:00]
political Awakening and that happened
because of something that happened in
his personal life which I'm not going to
discuss on this stream uh the second
thing I think on top of that is he has a
very heavily regulated industry he's in
whether it's and Tesla in terms of the
automotive industry and he also is in
another industry that's heavily
dependent on government contracts or can
benefit from Cost Cuts such as um SpaceX
so he hases have incentives for the way
that government contracts are
decided that would benefit his
companies's financially as well and yeah
and also a lot of people as political
and business enemies have tried to
personally ruin him and he's this is
probably some sort of Revenge campaign
to a certain um
uh what's it called um a certain
motivation there but I think it's a
number of variables but yeah there are

[1:43:00]
number of variables but yeah there are
economic benefits to him personally from
deregulation but there are also
other reasons um have I ever been told I
look similar to Andy Kaufman no I don't
think I look anything like Andy Kaufman
I've seen pictures of him I watched that
Jim Carrey movie Man on the Moon when I
was a kid about him and uh no I mean I
don't know I mean there's a ODOT jokes
in the 80s and the 90s that he died of
some terminal illness that he faked his
death and like 20 or 30 years later he
would come back and say oh it was all a
joke but and we haven't really seen any
conf from back so it probably wasn't a
joke
but yeah who is elon's class well elon's
class is he's counter Elite he's like
classical counter Elite and he's trying
to use the political reignment to move
move into the create the new
establishment
Elite um well I don't think that if I'm

[1:44:01]
Elite um well I don't think that if I'm
wrong I don't think the wealth Gap is
increasing anymore I think it peaked
before the pandemic um wages have been
going up and stock market
valuations have not gone up faster
really um outside of a few big
technology companies so I
mean I don't think that it
has um elon's expect to be a
trillionaire by 2027 well what is elon's
net worth right now I mean that's you're
basically assuming that Tesla stock is
going to continue to go up even as
faster than its actual profitability and
revenues and things like that which I
mean and or SpaceX is going to become
much bigger than expected I mean there's
a good chance that elon's net worth is
already peaked like I don't really know
you can't really just say oh it's
certain he's going to be a trillionaire
who
knows
[Music]

[1:45:00]
[Music]
um yeah can you name a few people from
The Establishment well it's generally
the political class um is in the
establishment old money families like
The Heirs of like the Rockefellers or
the Johnson and Johnson fortune or
variety of other ones I don't really you
probably know they like watch Old Money
luxury's Channel he goes into all those
establishment Elite families and that's
why I don't really do breakdown specific
families because he doesn't um he does a
much better job of explaining those in
fact I might do some collaborations with
him in the future because um he's a fan
of this channel so cool that's stay
tuned for
that do you think Silicon Valley is
going to replace wall Street's interest
why or why not I don't think it's going
to replace them but it's going to create
a competing set of
interests so and the bright side for
young people looking to get jobs and
finance is that the rise of Silicon
Valley has made meritocratic access much

[1:46:01]
Valley has made meritocratic access much
more available like it was when I was
fresh out of school like Wall Street was
super competitive and restricted to just
the ivy league recruitment because that
was the only place to go if you were an
ambitious person really willing to move
up a class and make real money and I
just happen to like that profession but
that's and then whereas when Silicon
Valley became more bigger and more
established money it created a competing
um pipeline for ambitious people to move
up the ranks and so now we have more
opportunity sets not less so I think
it's a good thing you have competing
interest and there's other cities that
have that too like Houston is like the
big oil Center um you have Miami for
Latin American Finance and cross um
Pan-American trade you have La for
entertainment in Asia Pacific trade and
yeah you and you have the Midwest for
heavy machinery interest and

[1:47:00]
heavy machinery interest and
Manufacturing so yeah what are your
thoughts on the establishment of a
sovereign wealth Fund in the US well I
don't if you watched my video that came
out on Wednesday but I did one about um
The Sovereign wealth
fund and what they are and my thoughts
on it I think it's generally a bad idea
I mean if you are a country that either
has a large amount of Trade Surplus or
has a natural resource that is so
abundant that you can export it and
those
exports can pay for um all of your
government financing and you don't need
taxes like great like that's what it's
been done in places like Singapore and
in the Arab world and in Alaska and
Norway um but when it comes comes to
um the US the US has a large
debt why would you not just use that

[1:48:01]
debt why would you not just use that
money to pay down the debts like if you
think the Sovereign wealth fund can get
a higher return than the expected
interest payments on the debt the growth
of their
increases
then like maybe but I don't really trust
the government to be a better allocator
of capital than the private sector the
other thing too is if your government is
primarily financed by taxes and you did
have a balanced
budget instead of putting that money
into a sovereign wealth
fund why wouldn't you
just um give it back to the taxpayers I
think the average individual taxpayer is
a much better um allocator of their own
money than the government is like if
you're in a sovereign if you like the
idea of a sovereign wealth fund you're
basically say like I think the
government is better at investing in the
private sector which I would short that
bet every time and I think individuals
if they got that money back in their

[1:49:01]
if they got that money back in their
pockets would be able to improve their
lives or invest at higher rates of
return um and I think businesses in the
private sector will generate a lot more
wealth uh that's my problem with like if
again let's say the US discovered a
giant gold mine under Kansas City that
was bigger than all the gold Supply in
the world and we didn't need taxes
anymore then there maybe is a certain
was like Alaska is a s wealth fund and
they pay their citizens a dividend every
year because of the from the returns of
that fund that could make sense also
maybe like turning the Social Security
trust fund into a real Sovereign wealth
fund like a like a pension fund um a lot
of Canadian Pension funds kind of do
that thing and invest but you look at
the track record of a lot of us Pension
funds such as um Calpers that's not that
great like again people would be better
off probably saving their own retirement
investing in the private sector um so
I'm not a fan of sovereign wealth funds
uh the next thing um

[1:50:01]
uh the next thing um
is um favorite road trip
snacks um yeah I mean there's a a few
like I like Goldfish crackers probably
and Chez itss are good road trip
snacks um I if I'm the other thing is if
um if it's like early morning maybe a
blueberry often like instead of stopping
for breakfast I just eat that on the
road
um I don't really eat that I eat that
much snacks generally because it's not
good for my health like I I eat my three
meals a day and I kind of stick to that
um I lost a lot of weight when I was
younger simply just by giving up
snacks and I just I really only eat
snacks in like special occasions like if
I'm going to like a Super Bowl party or
something like that at this
point um yeah let's see uh Golden Oreos
another good road trip snack too

[1:51:00]
another good road trip snack too
um next one
um let's see coffee yes or no I don't
drink coffee I did briefly for a few
weeks when my first started my business
and I don't like the taste of it I don't
like the energy swings and I have a lot
of family members who didn't start
drinking coffee um until
um their 30s and now they can't wake up
without coffee I don't want to be like
my parents who can't wake up without
coffee I like the ability that I can
actually wake up in the morning with a
decent amount of energy without coffee
and I hopefully can maintain that my
entire life um if I the one caffeinated
beverage I do like is tea but I
generally only drink tea when I'm
feeling like a little under the weather
for some reason tea tastes a lot better
when you're sick versus when you're
healthy um the top three economic
between now and 2030 um the first one is
just High Cost of Living and
unaffordable housing

[1:52:01]
unaffordable housing
market the second one is Public Finance
or just the fact that so many national
governments have way too much debt and
are going to probably require severe
austerity or inflation to pay them off
and then the third one is labor
disruption from AI um or the bad quality
education system not enabling people
from being able to find the higher skill
jobs available so those are the three
disruptions
um yeah uh let's see next question is is
there is talk about ending the income
tax and people said and I used to make
this argument too it's like the prior to
1913 the entire federal government was
financed through tariffs and not income
tax uh that can work but you need a 1913
size government because 40 % of the tax
revenues are um income tax and we
already have a material deficit so you'd

[1:53:00]
already have a material deficit so you'd
want to get rid of the deficit and get
rid of that additional
40% of Revenue you would need to
drastically cut the size of government
to um to make that right
so that is um kind of my take on the um
I mean I'd love it but you would have to
replace it with something else if you
don't want to just get rid of every sort
of entitlement and I I wouldn't be enely
against that but I don't think the
American people would want to get rid of
every single entitlement and Slash the
military by over
50% uh the next question let's
see best places to meet young
professionals friends communities in a
new city I have some experience this
because I've lived in several new cities
um there's one is if you have exist
existing friends um or if you have
roommates you get along with they
introduce you to people um they're also
are Affinity groups like for me when I

[1:54:02]
are Affinity groups like for me when I
moved back here I met a lot of new
friends from being involved in my local
Chamber of Commerce because it's mostly
young entrepreneurs who are in there and
and I was a young entrepreneur so I made
a lot of friends that way um I also went
to certain social things like I was in a
tennis group um I got involved in my
local Catholic Young Adult Community um
I um got involved in local CFA society
which is like a finance thing and yeah I
made friends that way and then you
naturally meet friends from their
friends and kind of develop a Social
Circle and there's also certain
organizations that start social groups
or Social Clubs in town um that might be
fading but it was a popular thing like
in right shortly after the pandemic when
people just lost a lot of their friends
due to people moving because of that or
social
isolation but yeah just getting involved

[1:55:00]
isolation but yeah just getting involved
in certain Community things are probably
the
best way to to do that um yeah um and
then like and not all of them and the
thing is is that I read a good book it
was like I forgot the name of it
knockout networking it was written by a
former like boxer I think or boxing
coach but lesson is learned is the
two-thirds rule like when you go out to
a networking event or a party or a
social event you're not going to like
two-thirds of the people there well you
know if you if you connect with onethird
of the people you talk to you had a
great you it was well worth your while
you had a great
time um but that generally does not so
if like you don't get along with most of
the people the overwhelming majority of
people there don't take it personally
and a lot of people meet friends through
their jobs but the thing is with
co-workers is that they're oftentimes
your competitors for promotions and
other things so they may not be the most

[1:56:00]
other things so they may not be the most
um genuine friendships so like if you're
like working in say like completely
different departments or like are not
really on the same projects then it's
more likely to work in terms of
cooworker friends and also they might be
in different stages of life like when I
worked at a big company or just a larger
company most of my co-workers were 10
plus years older than than me and were
married with kids and so like they were
just in a different stage of life and
didn't have time to hang out with
me um do you think poor rical become a
US state and what be the economic
political consequences of that change um
I think it'll be very difficult um
problem with Puerto Rico becoming a
state is three-fold one there's the
language barrier and until English
becomes the predominant language of
Puerto Rico it would be hard to sell it
on becoming a state the second is the
political one like Puerto Rico is
overwhelmingly has more left-wing
populist politics
and as a result it's the same reason why

[1:57:01]
and as a result it's the same reason why
I don't think the US won't Annex Canada
is because if you do that it's gonna add
two Democratic senators and probably
five out of the six they probably like
there's three million people and there's
seven so there be add four members of
the house and probably three of them at
least if not all four will be Democrats
consistently and so that is probably a
hinder
um maybe if you had a deal where example
you brought in Puerto Rico and you split
California in half for a more red
California that might be the way so you
even out the impact in the Senate it had
to be something like that like that's
what happened with Alaska and Hawaii
like Hawaii was anticipated to be the
Conservative Republican dominated State
and Alaska was anticipated to be the
Democrat state yet with the discovery of
oil in Alaska and the pl the fruit plant
plantations losing power in Hawaii it
actually ended up being the opposite but
that was what kind of helped those the
cases for those two being integrated

[1:58:00]
cases for those two being integrated
into the
US and then the third issue is Puerto
Rico's financial situation they have
massive amount of debt they're they
already struggle in terms of having a
competitive economy because their
productivity is not justified matching
the same minimum wage that the main us
has and you have a lot of just different
cultural and economic and Regulatory and
differences in terms of work ethic and
vacation time and other things that just
make it hard to set up business and also
the fact it's in a hurricane Zone also
puts it at risk too and a lot of the
more ambitious Puerto Ricans have
already moved to the mainland United
States which kind of magnifies a lot of
the problems so I think the status quo
is really going to um be maintained for
Puerto Rico because I think they would
lose out if they became independent
because of a lot of the subsidies that
the rest of the country gives them
whether directly or
indirectly but there's a lot of

[1:59:01]
indirectly but there's a lot of
political barriers that I've mentioned
for them becoming a
state and so yeah I didn't know Puerto
Rico had such a low birth rate maybe if
Puerto Rico's population drops enough
then it may not be seen as a threat but
that's still the two Democratic senator
problem um what what are your thoughts
on why poor countries stay poor um yeah
I mean I think it's because of like I
mean of
Institutions you have negative
incentives built into a lot of these
countries and their cultures do not
promote entrepreneurship or capitalist
development or um anti-corruption so
it's whether it's e like and so as a
result the combination of corruption or
um tall poppy syndrome
or like lack of Education or lack of
priorities for that or weak business
culture there's a lot of things but it's

[2:00:00]
culture there's a lot of things but it's
mainly cultural driven because a plot of
the places that were poor once they
adopted the right institutions and
mainly think of Northeast Asia and um
Eastern Europe post the fall of the
berin wall were able to rapidly converge
towards the developed economies whereas
the countries that do not adopt these
certain institutions
or just are too corrupt to implement
them correctly stay poor so yeah I think
that's really the
answer thoughts on Peter
theel um I think Peter Thal has been a
net positive um for the development of
the conservative movement in the United
States and I think he makes a lot of
valid interesting points about
Innovation and politics and Society I
watch a lot of his interviews on YouTube
he'd be somebody who I'd love to have as
a guest on on this channel too uh him
and Yannis far Fus are the two I've
mentioned so far but um yeah he does

[2:01:00]
mentioned so far but um yeah he does
have a lot of power I mean I don't
really paler is kind of a black box but
it's kind of shows like that his
influence on foreign policy probably
somewhat influent by how much the
government uses it but yeah I don't
think Peter teal is a net posit like he
is the one who changed the cons along
with Trump changed conservatives in
America from like the sty like neocon of
John McCain and um George W bush to the
more vibrant type of conservatism that
we have now in this country I have to
give Peter t a lot of credit for
that
um let's see do I have any more
questions if I'm gonna probably be on
here for another 15 minutes or so so if
you want um to ask me a question get it
in
um otherwise I am going to um log out
but while I'm waiting for questions I
remind you guys and you could scroll up
on the to see is that the tour is

[2:02:03]
on the to see is that the tour is
expanding we are
going March in Miami Phoenix next week
uh in Texas um and in May to the
Northeast us DC Philly York and um early
June Calgary and we're going to do
Europe in late August and early
September we have some other summer
destinations but it's too early for me
to announce those within the United
States uh vacation
Finance what is the appropriate portion
to take-home pay spend on vacations I
generally use two and a half percent
gross income per year on vacation so if
you make H 100,000 a year you could
spend two two and a half Grand on all
your vacations for the year uh that's
how I budgeted in it's enough that as
your income grows you can go on nicer
vacations but it's also financially
sustainable and it also if you know what

[2:03:02]
sustainable and it also if you know what
you can afford for vacations in advance
it can help you design trips that fit
that
budget so um that is what I would do and
you would be surprised how if you do
things the right way you can actually
have really nice vacations on very
reasonable budgets
uh yeah is free healthc care actually
plausible um no it's not because um you
can't really allocate like the problem
is with Healthcare you have unlimited
wants but limited
Supply you can you have to ration it
somehow you can ration it through either
um restricting who can get it at all you
can ration it by um
length of time or you can ration it by
cost America has Chown to

[2:04:00]
cost America has Chown to
um what's it called rationalize it by
cost like if you will give it to anybody
but the price will get will go up as
high as it needs to go to do it uh
Europe has decided that look we'll make
Healthcare accessible to everybody at no
cost but we're not going to meet the
demand so it's going to have to be
delayed La the time and or restrict who
gets it and then Canada with ma is
trying to basically reduce the amount of
people who are eligible and be more cost
effective with what they give it and I'm
a post made and similar things from a
moral perspective but those are the ways
there's a funny meme about this that he
probably repeated on the internet so
yeah you can't really have free
healthare it's like you can't really
have free housing either there's no
incentive to produce
it if you don't like um so that's kind
of um everything has a cost uh the next

[2:05:00]
of um everything has a cost uh the next
thing is um I got from question is since
this episode is economics of dating do
you have any advice for people who are
curious about the institution of
marriage from a finance or other social
benefit point of view is it worth it I
did a debunking the Doomer on marriage
as the Valentine's Day special last year
and I argued in that video that
um I am for the ins I think marriage
does work and um what's it called
um
uh um what's it called um yeah I'm I
just tested out the Super Chat goal
thing to see if it what it actually will
work but the point being I was going to
go back to the marriage thing um yeah I
think generally marriage is a good thing
in terms of the benefits it has from
life expectancy and overall happiness

[2:06:02]
life expectancy and overall happiness
and a healthy outcome to raise kids who
will have better economic outcomes
themselves uh but when it comes to um
uh the what was I going to say when it
comes to from a pure Financial
perspective on individual level it
really depends on your
situation um I think that that there's
also tax benefits to getting married but
it's more importantly just like the the
fact that you have somebody who's going
to go through the ups and downs of life
with you and a stable family will just
make your quality of life better uh but
watch my video for about for that
specifically uh if someone in college
sends do entrepreneurs Tech how would
you recommend spending the remaining of
their 20
um you spend three to five years working
in the industry that you would want to
start a product in that will give you
the time to build the right amount of

[2:07:01]
the time to build the right amount of
experiences and connections needed to
event figure out what the need is to
that the startup will provide because
there's no point of starting a startup
if there's no demand for your
product and also um the other thing is
you will also gain the skill set and the
experti to be credible when you're
trying to raise money for investors or
get your first clients on board um
that's my advice uh you graduate from
college put your three to five and maybe
if you're in a more Capital intensive
industry say like oil drilling um then
um you can um you might need more time
because you probably need to raise more
money therefore you need more expertise
and the expertise is more advanced and
complicated you're dealing with a lot of
heavy machinery
so that is um my um take on that and

[2:08:00]
so that is um my um take on that and
then yeah thanks for the um the Super
Chat dire golden
mantis
um yeah um let's
see I'm GNA scroll up here
for other
questions seems like I have a lot more
comments then questions on this one I I
always read all of these after the um
the live chat replay is
available
so yeah like I mean but like if it's
it's a
comment I don't really know what the the
actual question really
is um but um next um thing is
um all right right do you think Ubi is
going to be a consequence of advancing
technology or becoming political
currency in the long
run uh I think that Ubi I've talked

[2:09:03]
run uh I think that Ubi I've talked
about this in several one of my videos
is not really a solution here because
there always be a relative problem like
if you're trying to really just plate
the masses who are unemployable you're
better off just plugging them into the
metaverse Matrix style but they're
ethical concern concerns for that too um
I think that
um the first of all there being
inflationary impact we saw this with
like the pandemic unemployment benefits
if you give everybody a bunch of money
in the stimulus checks that's just going
to be net inflationary and therefore
just the price level will raise
proportionately um the other thing is is
if you don't have the incentive for
people to produce stuff you're going to
have less supply of goods and the same
if not more demand which is also so
inflationary and this creates also some
a lot of negative incentives like if the
government is literally paying you a
salary which is what Ubi essentially is
then you're GNA incentivize to vote for

[2:10:01]
then you're GNA incentivize to vote for
politicians who will increase that
salary and that provides a lot of um
negative incentives that would otherwise
mess up the
economy
um okay opinion on the importance of
looks for
men um it's not as important
as it is for looks for women
generally uh I think that I know plenty
of people who have had are very
good-looking but who struggle with
dating because they are either um have
they have like a unattractive
personality uh whether it's just they're
not likable or they have social
awkwardness or on the Spectrum or
whatever it is and where you see people
who are not very good particularly
good-looking but do very well because of
their career or their Charisma or the
Riz as genz like to say or other things

[2:11:01]
Riz as genz like to say or other things
so I think it is a variable but it is
not the
variable um especially like the one
thing that does seem to be very um
sensitive to is height to a certain
degree which is sad because really men
can't really control that but I've met
plenty of people who are otherwise very
average or below average looking who've
done good at da just because they're
tall like so youve it really can be a
bunch of things but I think it's I
wouldn't be worried about I don't think
looks maxing is a very smart strategy
you're better off just improving and
developing yourself in terms of your
career or your personal Ambitions or
becoming a more interesting uh person um
advice on making a monthly budget
allocating wages um you got to create a
spreadsheet step one then list all your
predictable costs and then figure out
what's left over from there but in

[2:12:00]
what's left over from there but in
general in terms of
allocations um I would say depending you
have whatever you have to pay in taxes
you have to pay in taxes but for most
middle class people it's about
25% is just kind of a proxy so have that
for taxes I wouldn't I I would Target
and depend on where you live on higher
cost of living this might not be viable
especially earlier in career but lower
cost of living it could be easily done
you want about 25% towards housing costs
and then another 25% towards savings and
then the remaining 25% towards
everything else that's like an ideal
budget so like as your income grows
you'll be saving more and you will
also be have be able to increase the
lifestyle because like the fire idea of
just living super a steer and saving
every extra um penny is going to get old
and it might lead to it's kind of like
people who die and starve themselves
consistently and once they get over it
they just Splurge uh fire is like to the

[2:13:00]
they just Splurge uh fire is like to the
financial equivalent of that
so that is a um something that I would
factor in really
there and
so yeah but at the same time if you
consistently inflate your lifestyle with
your income you'll never save and you're
going to be in trouble when it comes to
retirement or building any meaningful
wealth so you got to have a balance
um what would I put on my Mount Rush
more of economists I'll probably think
of a better answer for this after the
live stream but there are a few I can
think of off the top of my head uh yeah
I'd probably put Adam Smith because he
literally kind of was the one who
formerly invented the field I would
probably put Friedrich Hayek on there I
would probably put Milton fredman on
there and let's see who else would I put

[2:14:03]
there and let's see who else would I put
like I got my Austrian I got my Chicago
I got Adam
Smith uh the fourth one is kind of the
um the um the challenge and I'd probably
realize it after this live stream
but um I guess I'd have put canes even
if I don't agree with a lot of his stuff
because how influential he was in
term I put that would probably be my my
Mount Rush
more they particularly like um
keynesianism that much or if you want to
do purely just on impact I'd probably do
it' be Marx KES um Fredrick Hayek and
Milton
Freedman um Adam Smith actually Adam
Smith should should be on there too so
there probably should be five like in
terms of because an important Economist
or maybe I'd Place Hayek with Adam Smith
um the next one is um what do you think

[2:15:05]
um the next one is um what do you think
of Robert kiyosaki's phrase Savers or
losers I mean I haven't read Robert
kosaki since Rich Dad Poor Dad when I
was in high school so I need some more
context on that but savors aren't losers
if they invest their
savings how you build
Capital like you can't like if you spend
everything then you're just going to be
broke your whole life so maybe it's just
he thinks oh a saver who just puts in a
savings account and doesn't invest but
that's not really smart I don't really
think anybody really does that um
so uh do you see more people starting
families but not getting married or
getting married and not registering with
the government uh well a lot of the
churches will not improve of your
marriage if you don't register with the
government so that is going to be
somewhat of a deterrence I think the
problem with marriage is mainly in
family formation is just the high cost

[2:16:01]
family formation is just the high cost
of
housing um if you um had more affordable
housing people would get married quicker
and have and have larger
families and a lot of men don't feel
cons getting married until their
finances are at a certain level and a
lot of that is indexed to to to housing
costs uh
yeah
that's my thoughts on
this
uh all right I
think I think I'm gonna wrap it up here
if I don't really have any more
questions thank you guys all for um for
joining um I actually this was a um I
guess people weren't as interested in
this topic as I thought but it was great

the dating type topics because I don't
really want to answer those questions
