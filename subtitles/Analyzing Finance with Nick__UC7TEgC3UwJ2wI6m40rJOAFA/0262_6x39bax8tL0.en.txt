Jay-Z president Trump is replacing the
eb5 Visa with a gold card apart from
being a status symbol the gold card
effectively will allow foreigners who
pay the US government 5 milli ion doll
directly to purchase a permanent
residency and effectively have a green
card andth the citizenship in the United
States there have been indirect programs
that have done this in the past most
notably the eb5 program which required
minimum investment and hiring a minimum
amount of Americans and therefore
creating jobs to justify your ability to
move the gold card arguably allows a
more direct contra ution to the US debt

[01:02]
more direct contra ution to the US debt
and paying off the deficit whereas it
will be just a direct payment to the
federal government and the future tax
earnings for these permanent residents
in the United States will contribute to
in the form of increased federal tax
revenue without having to have
additional taxes on current Americans
this might actually do better for the
government fiscal situation than the
indirect rout of hopefully having the
economy grow through the businesses
created through the eb5 program so what
is the impact of this are we going to
see just a flood of high net worth
foreigners moving into the United States
and making a lot of housing markets even
more Out Of Reach or is this no big deal
at all first let's look at the numbers
there are approximately
426,000 ultra high netw worth
individuals and by the definition of

[02:00]
individuals and by the definition of
ultra high n worth individuals is about
people with a $30 million net worth it's
a little bit higher than my official
definition being R which is $20 million
but I couldn't really find any specific
source that has the $20 million cut off
it's either like will give me data on
people with more than 5 million net
worth or more than 30 million net worth
so I'm just going to use the 31 for the
calculations and 5 million out of 30
million is over 177%
of one's net worth that you're
effectively going to have to pay the US
government for the right to live in the
US and I don't really see somebody who
is high net worth but not at this level
willing to throw in more than 20% of
their net worth just to be able to move
to the United States short of any major
political crisis in their home country
so let's just put I think that's a good
cut off so out of that 225,000 of that

[03:00]
cut off so out of that 225,000 of that
426,000 live already in the United
States and that includes native born US
citizens and people who have naturalized
the country whether through the E5
program or other means and so if you
take all of those out you only have
about 200,000 left and a quarter of
those are in Western Europe and
significant portion of another 100,000
of them are in China and then there's a
s amount in Japan and South Korea so if
you take out Northeast Asia Europe and
the United States you only have about
50,000 people who could afford to buy
the gold card left and I think there
will be some people from Europe and from
China who would also buy the gold cards
oh even with you factor in all of those
realistically the probability that
you're going to have enough people to

[04:00]
you're going to have enough people to
come to pay off the national debt is
zero the national debt is approximately
$30 trillion at a price of5 million per
gold card you would need 6 million
people to buy gold cards to pay off the
national debt if you double the price to
10 million you would need only 3 million
but that also would reduce the amount of
people who qualify and as I told you
there's probably at most a 100,000
people which and this would be over a
multi-year period probably over a decade
period that would take advantage of
buying the gold card at most so if you
have only 100,000 people who buy the
gold card that's still going to raise
about
500 billion dollar which is a lot of
money that is about a little bit more
than a quarter of like the annual
deficit and it's about 160th of the
national debt so like a little less than

[05:02]
national debt so like a little less than
2% so I mean it's material but I don't
think the US's fiscal policy crisis is
going to be solved by the gold card
however I think the gold card is
probably more efficient in terms of from
a regulatory and compliance and
bureaucratic method and probably more
net revenue positive version of the eb5
Visa so swapping it is probably not a
terrible idea if you have a 100,000
highet Warth people coming to the US
from all over the world over a 20-year
period I think it'll have some minor
effects particularly among very high-end
housing markets particularly in the
Gateway cities such as Southern
California the Bay Area New York Miami
Houston maybe but apart from that I
don't really see it having that big an
impact in terms of displacing existing
Americans and in terms of a material

[06:00]
Americans and in terms of a material
impact on the economy I think it will do
a marginal amount to improve the debt
and as my video I did about how to
balance the budget every one of these
little things count but it's not really
the fix all that the Trump
Administration and many conservatives
hope it would be is if you look at like
the proportion of people who bought
golden visas in other countries that
offer them such as Spain Portugal the
United Arab Emirates and Greece it's
about anywhere from0
.3% of the population to
0.1% of their native population and 0.1
of the American population is over
300,000 people which there aren't even
that many non-american high num
individual ultra high individuals in the
world that even qualify so it's not
going to have the same effect that it
had on the cost of living like it did in
a place like Portugal which actually did

[07:00]
a place like Portugal which actually did
see a lot of potential displacement from
a lot of digital Nomads moving there but
they also have separate digital Nomad
Visa which made that problem more of an
issue and then if you look at the
history of the eb5 Visa In America which
was the previous form of this you had
about since 1990 approximately 90,000
people who have taken advantage of the
ev5 Visa and since this is easier it's
just a straight cash purchase versus a
Regulatory Compliance headache of having
to make sure that your business that you
want to set up and your job creation
qualifies for the federal government's
metrics there's no Hoops to jump through
so I think you'll have a greater
adoption but there are only so many
ultra high net worth individuals who can
afford to pay the price tag so I think
it's going to probably be somewhere
between 50 to
100,000 and they'll probably be pretty
spread out across the world I think
you'll see a lot from China you'll see a

[08:00]
you'll see a lot from China you'll see a
lot from Latin America you'll see some
from Western Europe particularly the UK
Norway and Germany which have like very
friendly unfriendly policies towards H
individuals maybe a few french would buy
it as well I think you see a lot of
Canadians too and but it's still not
really enough to the needle
significantly so overall I mean it is
going to help somewhat and your country
club membership or high-end home prices
might go up a little bit on the margin
because of this but I don't think it's
enough to really completely shake the
American system America is already the
Country Club of the RIT for a lot of
other reasons and if you want me to do a
video about why I call America the
Country Club of the Rich let me know and
I will do a more deeper dive into that
concept because there's a lot of things
in the regulatory system and American
culture and the way our economy is

[09:00]
culture and the way our economy is
structured that it already is kind of an
appealing spot for international Elites
to have a second home if not relocate to
outright even before this golden Visa
also what do you think about the golden
visa and if you are a non us viewer of
this channel would you buy a golden Visa
yourself thank you for watching
