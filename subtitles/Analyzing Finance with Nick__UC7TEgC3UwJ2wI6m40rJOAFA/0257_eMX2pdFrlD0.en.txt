welcome to analyzing Finance with Nick
we are going to be going back into
another Iceberg Series in fact I'm
probably going to do two Iceberg series
over the next few months where I break
down icebergs in various concepts
related to finance and economics we did
the iceberg of Finance it was one of the
original series of this channel we 2023
we did the iceberg of economics and 2025
the first Iceberg I'm going to be
talking about which is the one that won
the poll that we did on this is the
iceberg of wealth management just as a
disclosure I am the partner at a wealth
management firm called spearhead
advisors and nothing in this is
investment advice or any promises for
better returns I am not a Tax Advisor
and I'm not an estate attorney so like
if you are do not use this Iceberg as
advice about how to optimize your taxes
or your estate planning needs if you

[01:00]
or your estate planning needs if you
have any specific questions about
anything involving wealth management
feel free to contact me directly either
via email or through the contact form in
the pinned comment or the description or
through my website nickp party.com and
without further Ado let's get to the
first layer the first concept in the
first layer is index funds index funds I
assume you guys are all familiar with
they're basically an investment that
people can put a fixed amount of money
in and buy shares of an index usually
through an ETF the most popular index
ETF is the S&P 500 ETF ticker simple spy
and index funds allow investors to just
not try to make specific stock picks but
instead invest in the entire index the
most common way to do this is through
the S&P 500 or the NASDAQ but could also
be done with other indices such as the
Russell 2000 specific sector indices if

[02:01]
Russell 2000 specific sector indices if
you just are want to invest in a
particular sector and you think that is
going to do well but you don't know
what's the best company in that sector a
lot of international IND indices out
there for every company country with a
big enough stock market to really take
in foreign Capital has an international
index some are tradable via ETFs others
are not and then you have indexes for
all kinds of things but the main reason
why this is the first one in wealth
management because it's become the
trendy thing among wealth advisers to
give up on doing specific stock picks
and switch to indexing in my opinion I
think indexing works for certain asset
classes in certain times of the market
cycle but other asset you're better off
trying to actually either pick stocks or
invest in active managers I'm going to
get into the active passive debate later
in this Iceberg but and the flaws of
indexing too but the main risk for
indexing is overc concentration and the

[03:00]
indexing is overc concentration and the
market becoming just less efficient
because indexes have gone from like 20
years ago being less than of assets
under management so it's kind of brings
up a freeloader problem where in theory
people don't want to have to worry about
being the market but they can just get
the market return with the index but if
everybody does that the market becomes
inefficient because there's nobody out
there competing to try to beat it and so
that's kind of the dilemma with index
funds so it's pretty simple concept you
can for a low fee you can buy an entire
index of your choice instead of trying
to pick individual Securities the next
concept we're going to talk about are
financial advisors I did a whole video
about financial advisors which I'm going
to put a link to in the description but
a financial advisor there really is no
true definition for it's kind of a
morphous term that can mean anything
from a life insurance salesman to a
hedge fund manager to a wealth manager
to like an estate planner it's just kind
of a term that's a blanket ter for

[04:00]
of a term that's a blanket ter for
anybody who helps you optimize your
finances in a better way for more
details on that I recommend watching my
longer video the next one is 41k is kind
of the standard employment retirement
plan what is known as a defined
contribution there is also Define
benefits which is a classical pension
where the employer funds a pension 100%
And they agree to pay you a fixed amount
of income every year from your
retirement to your death however just
due to the unsustainability of Pensions
due to demographic
the business World in starting the 80s
switched from a defined benefit to a
defined contribution model where instead
of guaranteeing a certain amount of
money and retirement employers will
guarantee that they match the
contributions of their employees so if
say you put $1,000 in your 401k your
company will do so and these have a
maximum limit the most common one is
about 5 to 7% so say for example you
have a salary of $100,000 a year the
maximum you put in with the employee

[05:01]
maximum you put in with the employee
matching employer matching is
$6,000 and they'll put in another $6,000
so they get 12,000 and it saved every
year versus just what you would have
done on your own there are maximum
limits you could put in your
401ks regardless the next thing we're
going to talk about is emergency funds
are the idea that you save a certain
amount of cash in case if you have a
financial emergency whether it's a job
loss or medical catastrophe or some
other unexpected expense pops up that
you need to cover and your income is not
available to cover it because it's lost
or it's just way over what you normally
have and they call these emergency funds
and generally the advice for emergency
funds is anywhere from three months to
three years depending on the stability
of your job and if you have plans of
being an entrepreneur or what your
career goals or your family expenses are
are and before you generally have cash

[06:03]
are and before you generally have cash
to invest in the financial markets you
should first stock up your emergency
fund so that in the event that you do
have a job loss or some Financial
emergency you don't need to liquidate
your Investment Portfolio the next one
talk about IRAs or individual retirement
accounts are a self-directed tax
favorable retirement account whereas a
41k is are offered by employers and Ira
is self-driven so instead of ring on an
employer to create the platform for you
the you have your own Ira as a t
structure it's usually in the form of
like a specific account like so if in
your brokerage account you'll have a
normal taxable brokerage account and
you'll have a separate retirement
account for your retirement money which
will be your IRA there are two types of
IRAs there's a traditional IRA and a
traditional IRA is one where you put in
the money pre-tax into the IRA but then

[07:01]
the money pre-tax into the IRA but then
when you withdraw it you have to pay
taxes on it but it's able to accumulate
tax-free in the IRA and you're able to
contribute with pre-tax income a Roth
IRA is the reverse where it's after tax
income you contribute to the IRA but you
can take money out of it taxfree after
it compounds really the decision of
whether to use a traditional or Roth IRA
really depends on what tax bracket you
expect to be in retirement than it is in
your working years you would rather be
in a Roth IRA and if you would rather
and and if you think your income is
going to be lower in retirement then you
would rather be in a traditional IRA the
other thing is with Roth IRAs there are
maximum income limit for a Roth and the
reason they do that CU they don't want
High income people just putting all
their money into their Roth IRA and then
having less income to claim for

[08:01]
having less income to claim for
retirement from the government's
perspective and the max in 20 2024 it's
146,000 for a single person and
230,000 year for Merry joint filers so
if you're above you can't even fund an
IRA but there are ideas such as a
backdoor Roth which I'm not going to be
getting into this Iceberg but generally
that's the rules when it comes to IRAs
and the last thing in the surface level
is diversification diversification is
the idea that there's really the only
free lunch in investing is
diversification the idea of putting your
money in a bunch of different things is
going to offer better risk adjust return
than going Allin in a single asset class
or a single security and it's not the
people say oh I'm in the S&P 500 I am
Diversified no you're not you're just
100% in US large cap equities and even
with that 35%
of that S&P 500 Index is the top five

[09:04]
of that S&P 500 Index is the top five
biggest technology companies and if you
go to the top 10 companies it's over
40% so you're taking a lot of
concentrated risk if you're just putting
your money 100% in the S&P 500 true
diversification is not just a bunch of
different stocks because of of
correlations you got to find asset
classes that are non-correlated so that
includes bonds that might include
Commodities that might include non- US
stocks that might include stocks of
different capitalizations like midcaps
and small caps that can include
alternative Investments or real estate
so diversification just protects you
from like a specific asset class going
through a out of favor down cycle or
something structurally happens to impair
the valuation whereas if you just happen
to be in the one popular asset at the
time you may underperform and it might
look really bad for years and years but
over the long run a diversified

[10:00]
over the long run a diversified
portfolio will usually catch up with a
more concentrated portfolio with a lower
amount of volatility and risk now the
next one we're going to talk about is
the 4% Rule and the 4% rule is the idea
is that a retiree can safely withdraw 4%
of their income every year without ever
running out of money just due to
investment returns and compounding
that's generally like the safe rule of
what you can pull out in a given year I
personally like the idea better that
your max should be a little bit under
the investment yield you get that year
so you can not really tap into the
principle but you leave enough that the
principal can go up with inflation and
have some compounding because if you
just take out their entire investment
return every year your principal
eventually is just going to run out due
to inflation you'll need to take out
bigger and bigger amount and that amount
that so unless if your investment
returns are consistently higher than

[11:00]
returns are consistently higher than
inflation and there's no down Cycles in
the market you'll end up losing if you
pull out everything so four like
historically the S&P returns about 7 to
10% per year depending on what part of
the market cycle you're in and so all 4%
kind of gives you a safe margin of
cushion to factor in like the needed for
the portfolio to catch up with inflation
the next thing I want to talk about are
REITs REITs are real estate investment
trusts a Reit is kind of like a publicly
traded way to invest in a large piece of
property so say you have a large Class A
apartment complex and there's really not
one individual buyer who can afford to
take on the whole thing the way that you
investors can participate is that they
split the apartment complex into shares
listed on the stock exchange and you can
buy those and that is in the form of a
Reit the real estate is owned by the and
the shareholders own different shares of
the Reit there are certain rules to
REITs like they have a required payout

[12:01]
REITs like they have a required payout
ratios they have to pay out 85 to 90% of
their net end earnings every year you
can't just retain it in the re it has to
be paid out in the form of dividends and
that's why REITs are generally valued
not on their price earnings ratios or
other classical investment metrics but
on their dividend payouts and their to
their free cash flows or multiple to
their dividend and also real estate
REITs cannot hold cash
indefinitely like you need to the REITs
has to be invested in Real Property
which is like real estate whether REITs
most common form of REITs are in
apartment buildings commercial real
estate such as offices and Retail it's
also data centers farmland and yeah even
single family home rats exist now so it
has to be some sort of hard real estate
has to be the underlying asset of the
Reit so that is that simply REITs and
REITs may not have the same tax benefits

[13:01]
REITs may not have the same tax benefits
as real estate V investing it in the
conventional way but what they do offer
is more liquidity so if you want to be
able to get in and out of real estate
and allow you to buy like big Class A
type properties that are not really
typically available for individuals or
smaller institutional investors and it's
usually not just one piece of property
in a re too a lot of reats are a whole
portfolio so say have like made one
shopping center you're going to have a
whole portfolio of shopping centers
across the country or so of one
apartment complex you'll have a whole
bunch of either in a specific region of
the US or the entire country or even
International there's plenty of reats
that deal with overseas real estate too
if you want that kind of exposure the
next thing I'm going to talk about are
529 plans 529 plans are basically a way
that families can invest taxfree to pay
for their children or grandchildren's
college education it's operates
similarly to like a 401k or an IRA but

[14:02]
similarly to like a 401k or an IRA but
IAS are more self-directed and you can
invest in what you want 401ks are
usually limited to a set of Investments
based on what the employer permits and
then with 529s they're even more
restricted usually these prescribed 529
plans and they're different depending on
what state you live in each state has
their own like approved 529 plan and
some of them and a lot of the and
there's certain reasons why you would
pick one state or another depending on
where you live but with 529 plans it's
usually like these prescribed limited
investment options and they're usually
like Target date portfolios that will
Target when the child that you're
putting the money in is going to be
ready to go to college the advantages
for this is again it's taxfree the
disadvantages are it's very limited on
your investment selection and the money
has to be used for Education costs so if
you put too much money in the 529 plans
and you don't spend spending on
education related expenses when you do

[15:02]
education related expenses when you do
withdraw that you're going to get pay
tax and possible penalties so that's how
529 plants work and then the other
things we going to talk about is active
versus passive this is one of the main
debates for wealth management and
investing is do you put your client's
money into active management or passive
management active management is when the
advisor either is selecting specific
Investments whether it's Securities or
Alternatives or bonds themselves and or
hiring an active manager to through a
fund to do it for them whereas passive
is that you're just putting it in a
blind index and not doing anything and
just staying in the index I talked about
passive and the benefits and the
drawbacks of it in the index fund but
the main debate here is should you
actively manage assets or be passive
there's advantage to both the advantages
to passive is that it requires a lot

[16:02]
to passive is that it requires a lot
less work you have whatever the market
rate of return is in the given asset
class that the index is built off of
there's also often times they might be
lower fees so it's less expensive and
then if you're an advisor you could
focus more on Business Development and
other sides of your business because
you're not really having to worry about
Investments because you just have a a
fixed passive model that will allocate
to certain things and it will just take
care of itself the main disadvantages of
passive is excess concentration poorly
constructed indexes like an example
would be is like the Russell 2000 the
problem I have with the Russell 2000 is
that you have the best companies get
promoted to the midcap or the S&P 500
and the worst companies of the larger
cap indexes get kicked in to the Russell
so as a result there's a negative
selection bias it's like equivalent of
being like the third tier league in like

[17:00]
being like the third tier league in like
the English football pyramid so you're
not whereas at the S&P the best till the
small caps move up into the S&P and the
worst get kicked out you have the
opposite negative version of that ha
affecting midcap and small cap indices
and then there are certain other ones
where like like Emerging Market
countries the indices are heavily
weighted towards inefficient state-owned
Enterprises or certain countries indices
are flawed because one company is a
large portion of their economy like
inbev for Belgium or Novo Nordisk for
Denmark so you have to look at the
methodology of the indexes and can't
just blindly assume oh it's a index from
a major index or ETF provider it's a
great way to get the kind of exposures I
want and also just the dynamic change on
the market certain things in the index
might make sense or might not make sense
and even with it and even choosing which
index to use like say for example you
buy the equal weighted as S&P 500 versus

[18:00]
buy the equal weighted as S&P 500 versus
the capway S&P 500 even though it's
technically choice between two passive
indexes you're making you're technically
an active investor by choosing one of
those or the other like truly passive
means you just have like an all world
just very directionally or asset class
agnostic Outlook which I think is not
really in the best interest for most
investors like for especially on Whose
assets are large enough where
diversification really makes a
difference last two concepts are a
fiduciary and a custodian a fiduciary is
really the idea that and most registered
investment advisers such as my firm are
fiduciaries but it's the idea that the
adviser is obligated to work in the
client's best interest with a like a
broker they are more suitability they
just can't willingly put you in
something that they know is bad for you
whereas a fiduciary has a stand they got
to do what's in best interest of their

[19:01]
to do what's in best interest of their
clients they can't really factor in
things such as kickbacks from fund
providers or to the advisor or other
business interests that are not really
aligned with the best interest of the
client and so that puts fiduciaries at a
higher standard than other advisors and
if you are looking for advisor I
recommend picking a fiduciary so you
know that their best interest and their
fee structures often reflect that like a
fiduciary usually has a flat fee for
assets under management or maybe
sometimes has for higher net worth
individuals might have a Performance
Based compensation but with a
performance-based fee structure the
manager is willing to take excess risk
because they don't get paid unless if
the returns are above a certain level
and so as a result and they get paid
more the higher the returns are but they
don't really take any of the downside if
the portfolio drops so they have less
incentive to be defensive on their

[20:00]
incentive to be defensive on their
Investments and more incentive to be
overly aggressive so yeah but fiduciary
generally means that the that they have
to be aligned in the best interest of
your clients and the last one for tier
two is a custodian a custodian is the
basically the platform that holds the
assets uh like an advisor is somebody
who manages the assets whereas a
custodian is The Brokerage for most of
the time but it could be a bank or
somebody else who takes custody and
actually holds the assets old days being
their vault nowadays it's like a digital
platform example be like with my firm my
firm spearhead advisers is the fiduciary
and the active investment manager
whereas Schwab is our custodian so like
Schwab is the one hold physically
holding the assets like the your wealth
manager is not holding the assets like
in this case or some bigger Banks they

[21:00]
in this case or some bigger Banks they
are their own custodians but generally
there's a custodian that is separate
from the advisor and this is a generally
a positive thing because it prevents
things like what happened with Bernie ma
off because there's protections built in
with having a third party as a custodian
next with level three this is where it
starts to get a little bit more deeper
beyond the surface kind of level stuff
that we talked about in the first two
tiers first one is a family office and I
did a video called all about family
offices where I go into more details
about this but family office is
basically when if you're independently
wealthy and you have enough assets that
it's cheaper for you to hire your own
investment team and buy all the
resources needed to operate your own
in-house investment firm versus hiring
an outside manager and paying them a 1%
fee but often times if you're big enough
to have family office wealth that fee
goes down to like half a %c or slightly

[22:00]
goes down to like half a %c or slightly
above that so really the economics vary
depending on how active the family
directly wants to be involved in it like
say for example if you were a
professional Wall Street guy and you
start a family office you may not need
as big amount of assets under management
because you don't need to hire a CIO or
investment team because you have those
skills already whereas if you made your
money in some non-financial related
industry and you know next to nothing
about Finance then you're going to
probably need to hire a professional
investment team to run your family
office in order to pay them it's going
to be worthwhile to have a much larger
amount of assets so it's less than just
paying the fee for a manager so the
example would be like say if you have
your entire cost of running a family
office including the salaries of all the
staff and flights for due diligence and
Bloomberg terminal everything like that
is about a million dollars and if the
private Banker or high net worth
financial advisers charging half a
percent then you need to have at least
200 million under management to make the

[23:00]
200 million under management to make the
family office make sense from a dollars
and cense point of view however there's
other advantages to having a family
office such as privacy that you don't
have to share like the details of your
assets with an outside advisor or so
that might be a playing element in it
too and there's a status symbol like
having a family office is like kind of
like the ultimate I've made it signal
it's like I have real Fu money at that
point if you have a family office that's
why a lot of people in finance in the
business world all strive to have a
family office so and that's kind of the
the the main advantage of a family
office over like an Institutional
Investor is that it's only usually one
family and two since it's a family
office they don't have to really dis
it's just the family's direct money
investing their own money and not
clients they don't have to register with
Regulators because they're not a
business offering Financial Services to
other people they're just handling their
own investment like if you were trading
your own stock portfolio on Schwab you

[24:01]
your own stock portfolio on Schwab you
don't need to create a you need to
register yourself as an investment
advisor with The Regulators it's the
same with a family office just at a much
bigger scale the next thing is fire
which is the abbreviation for financial
Independence retire early which is the
idea that if you save enough of your
income and live austere enough
postretirement you can save enough money
that you can retire very early and not
have to work like example would be like
Tech workers who are making say $300,000
a year and they find a way to keep their
living expenses down to say like 30k a
year maybe like by living with their
parents or eating Ramen every day or
whatever and they and they after tax are
taking home
$120,000 a year compound that
Investments that can get up to about a
million bucks and you can at a 5% return
have 50,000
and you could live off that so if Rule

[25:01]
and you could live off that so if Rule
of 72 that your money takes about 7
years to double and you it probably take
you and if you're you're taking home say
like a h 100,000 a year you can probably
retire in about 7 to eight years if
you're willing to live a simple
Lifestyle the main disadvantages of fire
is one your life's probably miserable
living super AER the whole way up two
you're not guaranteed to live long
enough to enjoy that retirement or three
there's a real risk that either due to
high inflation or down years in the
financial markets that that money may
not last as long as you think it does
and you might have to go back to work
and you just it also the other challenge
really fires it probably precludes you
from having children because the cost of
having children is far more expensive
than most fire budgets and there are
more ways that people want a more
comfortable life and do fire and they
might take a little bit longer to save
it's called fat fire subreddit was an

[26:00]
it's called fat fire subreddit was an
example but really I think a fat fire is
more just conventional retirement and
doing it early whereas I think of fire
is more doing all the extremes you can
to get out of the job market as fast as
you can the next thing we are going to
be talking about our bogleheads and
bogleheads are named after John Bogle
who's the founder of Vanguard and it's
the idea that people who are just devote
dedicated to the idea of indexing and
that conventional investing is a waste
of time active manager and wealth
advisors are a grift and they just are
all in on just passive due to low fees
and that nobody can really beat the
market over the long period of time and
they have a lot of message boards and a
very active internet Community all
discussing this kind of thing the next
thing we're talk about is tax lost
harvesting tax loss harvesting is the
idea that you have like in Investments
that you can use the losers to Shield

[27:01]
that you can use the losers to Shield
some of the tax gains from your winners
so save like the capital gains tax for
example is 15% in your bracket and you
have um a stock that is up 100% And you
have another stock that is down 50% you
invested $2,000 in both of them and you
need to sell both of them to pay for
your wedding in the future so what you
can do to help mitigate your taxes is
instead of just selling them evenly what
you can do is you could sell all the
loser and take the tax loss which in
this case is
$1,000 and you can sell half of the
winner and so your capital gain on that
half is 1,000 and that is canceled out
by the capital loss from the loser and
you just keep the remainder and so you
have zero tax liability because you use
the losses to offset the game
and this is how a lot of portfolio

[28:01]
and this is how a lot of portfolio
managers help their clients become more
tax efficient so it's the end of the
year and you have a generally successful
year when it comes to returns across
your portfolio but either your clients
have liquidity needs or you want to get
out of a certain stock because you think
that it's become overvalued because it's
rallied so much what you can do is you
can sell the thing you want to get out
of or and you could sell this the
biggest losers against it in order to
minimize tax liability it may not
completely add up and Co you don't may
not have enough losses to cover all the
gains of the thing of your winners that
you're selling but it will help reduce
the tax burden and also if you do need
liquidity but there's nothing you want
to sell you can prioritize selling the
losers or at least enough of the losers
and to be matched by some winners that
there's no net tax liability from a
capital gains perspective there's even
algorithms that do this for a lot of
Robo advisors nowadays so it's a very in
practice next one is fees fees are how

[29:01]
practice next one is fees fees are how
investment advisors get paid or even
ETFs like indexes even have fees and
it's usually a flat annual fee on the
assets under management different
advisers have different rates of fees
different ETFs have different levels of
fees and mutual funds too there used to
be a lot of other types of fee
structures such as loads and rap fees
and the variety of that but those have
become less popular over the years in
favor of like for active advisors like
it's a straight fiduciary fee active
management fee or you have in the case
of indexes just a flat fee on the ETF or
the mutual fund and that's generally how
it is depending on the on the asset
class and the type of advice you're
getting it's anywhere from on the Larry
low end like 20 basis points for a
simple Index Fund to 2% or more for the
most exclusive hedge fund managers most
typical advisers charge about 1% so like
in between and most mutual funds are
anywhere from half a% to 1.2 there are

[30:02]
anywhere from half a% to 1.2 there are
plenty of funds and advisors who are
above or below those levels but that's
just kind of a a ballpark and I did a
whole video about fees that I will also
put in the description of this
