welcome to analyzing finance with nick
in today's video i'm going to be talking
about the economic future of saudi
arabia
is it really just a pure oil state or
will their diversification efforts
succeed
i will discuss that in the rest of this
video
the first thing to know about saudi
arabia is most of my viewers probably do
know
is that it is heavily dependent on crude
oil
if you look at
its gdp 45
of gdp in saudi arabia is due to oil
production
and it is responsible
for 75 percent
of government revenues
taxation
for individual citizens is next to
nothing
and the native saudi arabs lifestyles
are heavily subsidized by the state
i'll go into how that is the case later

[01:01]
i'll go into how that is the case later
but it's generally they are supplied
with
relatively easy government jobs at high
pay
and don't have to pay any taxes and live
a very comfortable life
and the reason why
they do get this kind of deal
is because the whole social contract of
saudi arabia
is
highly dependent
on oil funded living standards in
exchange for sacrificing political
rights
just as a disclaimer
i have been a critic of the united
states foreign policy towards saudi
arabia and the way that the saudi
government runs its country
and participates on the international
stage i've
this has been out there in several
podcasts that i used to do before i did
this channel
so keep that in mind when i get into
this
but i'm going to be as objective as i

[02:00]
but i'm going to be as objective as i
can here and the thing is that
the reason why a lot of these autocratic
regimes still work in the places that
they do
is that they've revised the social
contract to offer the citizens something
to not worry about having political
rights or representation
in the case of saudi arabia it's an
absolute monarchy ruled by the saud
family
and
they basically can do what they want and
the people really have no right to
object
but
the people are okay with this is because
oil revenues is enough to finance the
country
to live a much higher living standard
than it would if the country had to rely
on
its own domestic production
and as long as the oil money keeps
flowing
everybody remains fat and happy and i
used to be a metaphor but if you look at
the world obesity rate statistics the

[03:02]
the world obesity rate statistics the
gulf states have caught up to the us and
mexico
as some of the most overweight countries
in the world
diversification of the economy beyond
energy
really has been a challenge
the one part that actually has seemed to
work for them
is islamic and religious tourism due to
the hajj
in islam
one of the five pillars of islam is the
hajj which is a pilgrimage to mecca
mecca is the city where muhammad was
born and started
practicing
islam and really kind of found creating
the foundation of the faith and
the sacred
um
i think area there i don't know it's not
really a temple or sorry a shrine be the
better word but the black box known as
the kaaba
is in the heart of mecca and is the site

[04:02]
is in the heart of mecca and is the site
that
every muslim person
should visit if they have the means to
financially do it or in the physical
health ability to do it once in their
life and also when
muslims pray
they pray pointing towards whatever
direction of the kaaba is for those live
in the west that is east southeast
generally but that could be a different
direction depending on whatever part of
the world
you are in
and
as
the wealth of islamic countries overall
has grown to improved economic
development within those countries and
islamic migrants who have moved to the
west whose incomes have risen
you have seen a much bigger draw
and a ride to mecca and thus a rise in
tourism like the example the picture
here is the
clock tower hotel which right overlooks
the kaaba
and it attracts as you can see how the
size of this building
they do attract a serious audience that

[05:01]
they do attract a serious audience that
comes from around the islamic world
another fun fact is that if you were
non-muslim you are not allowed on this
town in fact they have highways that
i'll attach a picture to
they have like an exit that if for
non-muslims to get out because they're
not allowed to go to the holy cities
government as well needs high oil prices
this is picture is the fred's data of
the break even oil price for saudi
arabia
uh
as of 2022 it's around 70 dollars a
barrel
as i'm talking right now oil is trading
over 100 dollars a barrel
so the saudi government
is in the black but they are catching up
for several years
from basically 2016
to
2021 essentially
when
oil prices were
way under 70 dollars a barrel

[06:00]
way under 70 dollars a barrel
like the real drop started at the end of
and back then the break even for saudi
government due to how bloated a lot of
their social programs was well over 100
barrel it's come off since due to some
reforms within the saudi government
but it's still fairly high and the
historical inflation adjusted price
for oil longer term is in the 50s
so
this is going to be a problem if
oil prices fail to stay high
and as the saudi government's population
ages
and
grows in size which is doing both of
those
their liabilities and their breakeven
oil price is likely to go up right at
the time
when oil prices
are going to trend lower
for more my thoughts on oil prices
structurally long term i recommend
watching my critique of gail

[07:01]
watching my critique of gail
our finite world which i will put
in the description and also as the end
screen video if you want to keep
watching about this topic but
they basically need oil prices to stay
high to finance their government
spending which the high government
spending is really due to
the need to fulfill the social contract
that i mentioned previously in this
video
so let's compare saudi arabia to
some of the historically high
oil producing regions in the country
pennsylvania actually is the state where
the first u.s production of oil took
place in the early 19th century
western pennsylvania
was a big
oil country
for the 19th century and even to this
day especially thanks to fracking
oil production is still a sizable part
of pennsylvania's economy

[08:00]
of pennsylvania's economy
and texas on the other hand
is the modern oil powerhouse of the
united states and houston
all the skyscrapers therefore built on
oil and most of the major american oil
multinationals
are headquartered in the greater houston
area including the major oil services
companies
and so we're going to compare these two
um
historically energy driven states with
probably the most energy driven country
in the world in saudi arabia in terms of
economic performance
population in saudi arabia is 35 million
and growing
pennsylvania is 10.3 million texas is
29.1 million
they have slightly more people
than saudi arabia
combined
and land wise you see in the map on the
right
pennsylvania saudi arabia
and texas combined are about

[09:00]
and texas combined are about
they're about the size of maybe two
half of saudi arabia but if you exclude
that
empty quarter which is this bottom
right area
of saudi arabia this is just basically
you see there's no roads here this is
just
apparently there's empty desert there's
nothing no people here like in the
actual inhabited areas
pennsylvania and
south and texas are probably close to
about 80 percent
of
saudi arabia's land size so
they're pretty close
in terms of gdp
saudi arabia's gdp and hard dollar terms
is 864 billion dollars
it 1.8 trillion if you use ppp but with
a lot of these emerging
frontier market type countries
it really depends on
what you consider the baseline because
pvp is usually to adjust to a us cost of
living
but places like pittsburgh
or
texas like rural texas or even doubt

[10:01]
texas like rural texas or even doubt
metro dallas are not very expensive
especially
relative to the rest of america so
do i really think that
saudi arabia is less than half the cost
of living
of pennsylvania and texas for the same
standard of living
probably not if i have listeners who've
spent extensive amount of time living in
saudi arabia or saudi themselves and
have a comment on this
i'd love to hear your feedback because i
don't really know from any experience
i've lived in pennsylvania
i've spent some time in texas but i've
never actually been to saudi arabia
public spending is actually pretty
similar along all three
public spending in saudi arabia is 29
percent gdp in pennsylvania it's 28.8
and that counts pennsylvania's share of
the of federal spending
and same with texas it's towns tax share
philosophy is 22.2
of gdp
um unemployment is six point six percent

[11:02]
um unemployment is six point six percent
in saudi five point four percent in
pennsylvania and three point five
percent texas and the most interesting
thing here is energy exposure uh half of
saudi's gdp is energy 24 is just oil
rents alone
um
and i don't know if that 50 is counting
a lot of ancillary jobs and other things
that are
financed by oil money it may be even
much higher than that especially since
75 percent of their government budget
is funded by oil
pennsylvania is 10 percent of gdp is
energy and that's research recently due
to fracking in texas it's 35 percent of
gdp in texas
especially houston's economy has been
heavily correlated to oil but it's
gotten more diversified in recent years
due to a favorable
cost of living and tax climate that has
encouraged businesses and individuals to
move there in recent years
saudi cultural barriers diversification

[12:01]
saudi cultural barriers diversification
uh
saudi arabia wants to diversify beyond
oil and outside of the religion tourism
example i mentioned they've had a hard
time doing that this has been a goal
there since the 1970s and as i've seen
with the statistics i've showed you that
it hasn't really worked
i have a few theories on why this may be
the case
one innovation is difficult to foster in
a politically and socially restrictive
society
if you live in a place where you don't
have civil liberties that are taken for
granted in countries such as the united
states
it makes the risk-taking needed to
develop
technological innovation and
entrepreneurship a lot
less
worthwhile one because there's greater
social risk and personal risk and legal
risk and the profits may not be as high
either
also due to their views on
gender
you are limiting some of the human

[13:01]
you are limiting some of the human
capital potential of
half of your population
uh you don't need to be a hyper woke san
francisco style society to compete in
the modern world in fact that might even
be
much of a detriment the other way
but i don't think it's a stretch to say
that you need to have
i would say the level of social freedom
that say the europe and the united
states had in the 1920s to be a
competitive place and
the 1920s was not
nearly as socially liberal as it was
today or even 50 years ago but saudi
arabia
their current
approach to this is still their certain
way their will habits run their society
would even be of considered
repressive in the 1920s in the united
states forget about the 2020s
this lack of civil liberties problem
scares expats from wanting to live there

[14:00]
scares expats from wanting to live there
and foreigners and thus it requires a
much higher pay
to attract the talent and that's even
factoring the fact there's no income tax
in saudi arabia i've known people who've
worked there on expatriate projects
a lot of them actually live in dubai and
just fly into saudi arabia during the
week
brothers actually would live there
particularly those involved with
petroleum engineering
and yeah companies have to pay
not only higher salaries but often cover
the living costs and give a generous
expat lifestyle to convince
a western talent to want to move there
a lot of
lower level skilled labor from
other asian countries that are poorer
than saudi arabia comes just because of
lack of economic opportunity
in their home countries in it but still
it has to pay considerably more than
staying at home
saudi also has a approach to work ethic

[15:00]
saudi also has a approach to work ethic
that is concerning that i've even read
in their local editorials that isn't a
problem
similar idea with greece and portugal
where there's a lot of shadow government
jobs or ones that you come into work at
nine
you kind of chill out
go to do whatever a little bit of actual
minimal productive effort
go to lunch at noon and not come back
that's kind of a dynamic there and
i'm not really just saying that
because you have a problem with
i think the math says it too you have 79
of the private work sector being
foreigners
and just 33 percent of the population
overall
works in the private sector
so that is kind of just showing the the
social contract on the subsidy issue um
the recent crown prince mohammed bin
salman has been trying to open things up
they've built theme parks out there

[16:01]
they've built theme parks out there
they've tried they've
heard it allow women to drive
they've tried to loosen up and allow
more
i guess fun outlets for
socialization for younger people
but it still has a long way to go and
there's a lot of entrenched wahabi
interest in the country that will make
future opening up of the country
socially
a possibility i think maybe as
generations transition over time
this could be the solution um
to help kind of stimulate some sort of
development of other industries
but
it's
again the cultural barriers are really i
think what prevents
saudi arabia from
growing and the fact that diversifying
and the fact that they have so much oil
and the oil money is
as large as it is and can subsidize
their society
as totally as it does means that they
have
very little economic pressure

[17:00]
very little economic pressure
needed to diversify and improve whereas
countries who aren't as
blessed with natural resources
have a lot more pressure to reform
themselves like the most notable example
of history like
singapore and lee kuan yew
in the modern era and then the meiji
restoration of japan neither those
countries had any real natural resource
advantage
and so they had to rapidly modernize and
adjust
to have a viable place in the economy
and they've been wildly successful as a
result
one of the things that mohammed bin
salman the crown prince cereal wants to
do is build a futuristic tech hub city
called
neom
it would be
the red sea and it would be a
tri-national city that would include
parts of jordan
saudi arabia
and egypt
it would be a place that would
be built on electric transportation

[18:00]
be built on electric transportation
networks and using mostly evs
and very modernistic
environmentally friendly construction of
skyscrapers and city infrastructure and
become the silicon valley of the middle
east
uh i think this is a risk of if it
actually gets off the ground becoming a
a royal field of dreams for the saudi
government
if they don't
if they build this city
and do not
have the social reforms whether
in the entire country or maybe make this
a free zone
like kind of how hong kong and macau
were kind of like one country two
systems and we're special economic zones
well maybe neon will need to be a
special social freedom zone because
you're again if you want to have
innovation you need more social freedom
for people to feel comfortable
taking risk
and to attract
foreigners professionals

[19:00]
foreigners professionals
and like examples is you don't have to
go again fully
westernized that or fully adopt
what people perceive to be immoral
social liberalism like singapore is an
example of that
singapore is not what you would say is a
paragon of
social freedom and political freedom
but it has enough
minimum baseline
of social freedom and flexibility
um
that
even with a otherwise strict and
paternalistic government
people can do enough that they want on
their own and not have their life overly
micromanaged that they
are willing to put up with the
paternalistic government in exchange for
the economic opportunities
again saudi arabia can get its level of
social freedom maybe say to
early 20th century standards
in the west
that could do a lot to maybe help at

[20:00]
that could do a lot to maybe help at
least give this neon and some of their
diversification answers
a chance of working
so what can we really learn from this
situation
well i mean once the oil money is
tempting and natural resources can be a
blessing and a curse
i think with oil prices as high as they
are
saudi arabia will continue to do well
as i mentioned the break even is seventy
dollars a barrel on oil is trading over
a hundred and due to shortages triggered
by
environmentalist policies in many parts
of the world
and
the on top of that just
production backlogs due to coven and
geopolitical concerns taking russia out
of the oil market
you could have an extended period of oil
prices being higher than their
historical average kind of like 2010 to
2014 where you had four years of oil
averaging over a hundred dollars a
barrel before the bottom fell out
uh
once we do hit that for ice

[21:02]
once we do hit that for ice
that
is the demand destruction point
individuals around the world will adapt
and oil will drop down
and if opec were smart they would manage
to keep oil high enough that they can
fill their social contract obligations
but not high enough that
not too high so that people
uh
change their habits away from oil and
then with renewables
and cheap natural gas
and electrification of the automotive
fleet
the longer term run for oil
is a concerning one
it's not going to happen overnight it's
not going to happen in five years
but by the end of the century you could
see a world
that no longer runs on oil and a lot
sooner than that possibly too given
the pace of innovation going on in the
energy industry as a whole
and so saudi arabia will be in deep

[22:01]
and so saudi arabia will be in deep
trouble
unless they either do one of two things
one they figure out how to diversify
their country which based on their
history and the government in that
country who
cares about social hierarchical control
seems very unlikely to happen
or there's the second option is that
they maximize the amount of profit that
they can generate from oil now
and just sell as much oil as they can
at relatively high prices
and then just build a war chest
and invest it well enough that they can
counter the demographic aging surge
that's going to increase their
government social liabilities
and live off of just their returns it'd
kind of be like a rich family who has a
family office
that has good enough management that
just the compound returns on their
existing net worth

[23:01]
existing net worth
will be able to keep
the family alive permanently and for
generations to come since governments
don't have to pay estate taxes
when generations transfer
this could be the case that's
so either got a bet on saudi being
willing to reform or the people who run
saudis
uh sovereign wealth funds
being excellent fund managers
i can't really handicap the odds of
either one of those being the case but
it will be interesting to see
how saudi arabia shapes up in the future
thank you for watching
