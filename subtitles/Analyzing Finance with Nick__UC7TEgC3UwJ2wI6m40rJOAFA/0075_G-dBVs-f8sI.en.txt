the comic i'm going to be talking about
today is quiet quitting which is
hitting all the major news outlets such
as forbes the economist zero head to the
wall street journal
it's become the fashionable thing to
talk about and really the question is is
how is quiet quitting different
than the anti-work movement
or people just being lazy at their jobs
let's find out
[Music]
quiet quitting really a summary is
basically
doing the minimum amount of work needed
to not get fired
or to slack off as much as you get away
with at your job without getting fired
this is a common mentality in many
government jobs across the world
and
is very common in even the private

[01:00]
is very common in even the private
sector in certain parts of the world
such as europe
but now it is spreading
all over the world particularly in
places previously known for the
reputation of hard work in asia and the
united states
the question is is this different paul
ferry did a great twitter feed called a
brief history
of nobody wants to work anymore
and he goes through headlines basically
through every period of low unemployment
from the president all the way back to
the 1890s that there have been
consistent headlines
of people not wanting to work like in
a newspaper was quote with all the mines
in the country shut down by strikers
what will the port editor do for a coal
next winter it's becoming apparent that
nobody wants to work these hard times
and in 1905 labor is scarce high and
very unreliable nobody wants to work for
wages so yeah these aren't old
complaints people have been complaining

[02:02]
complaints people have been complaining
about
people not willing to work for
over a hundred years
so what makes it different now
what makes different now it's starting
to show up
in the productivity statistics if you
look at the non-farm business labor
productivity data which is measures the
output in dollars per hour for all
employed people outside of agriculture
we have had two consecutive quarters
of
contraction
outright and the minus 2.4
0.4
pace is the lowest since at least the
1980s
and
it just continues a steady downtrend
uh productivity
really peaked
like
in the 1990s and early 2000s
and really slowly but surely
it's been trending lower the growth of

[03:01]
it's been trending lower the growth of
productivity you have spikes that
usually happen right after recessions
like you got a spike in 2002-09
you had one in 2000 late 2020 early 2021
and
it's just a resumption of
if productivity when demand gets
restored after recession but
the highs are lower
and the lows are lower and like if you
look at a stock chart that's a downtrend
and seeing that in productivity is very
concerning it just means that less
people
are producing you have less stuff being
produced per hour of work or people are
just working less hours consume
concealed behind work remote screens
and
this is a major red flag that's why it
matters and you've seen movements around
the world preaching this type of quiet
quitting or anti-work which is outright
just opting out of the workforce and
settling just for the bare minimum gig
economy employment you need to keep a

[04:00]
economy employment you need to keep a
roof over your head
and it's not just the united states
you've had and i talked about this in my
anti-work video series
but around the world you have the lying
flat movement in china the freedom
hikamori culture in japan
and basically whatever's been happening
to the european labor movement since the
70s in general
and you just have this work to live
ethos that's historically
associated with scandinavia and france
and other parts of western mediterranean
europe is now spreading across the rest
of developed economies and china which
has lagged a generation or two
so why did it happen in europe first and
why is it catching up now
a lot of it really has to do
with
first is the expansion of the welfare
state
social welfare state has expanded in a
lot of these countries and the internet
has made people aware how cushy the

[05:01]
has made people aware how cushy the
lives are for lower middle class
europeans and they want a piece of that
themselves
on top of that
the expansion of the welfare state
allows for
people to have less consequences if they
decide to opt out or ease or reduces the
pain of getting fired enough that quiet
quitting becomes a viable
alternative the other thing is the
strength of the labor market
unemployment rate continues to be near
record lows in the full employment
territory and it's fairly easy to get a
new job right now
the risk of quiet quitting and getting
fired for it is lower because
one your employee will have a hard time
replacing you due to the tightness of
the labor market and two
it will be easier for you to find a new
job because of the overall tightness of
the labor market
and then last but not least which i
think is the biggest and most obvious

[06:00]
think is the biggest and most obvious
reason
it's just simply
real pay is not high enough to justify
working above and beyond
i talked about this too in the anti-work
series
but in the old days
like it didn't take that much due to how
much lower housing and education costs
were
to live what is considered a
middle-class lifestyle
like it's a you can easily do that on
say 60 to 80 k in today's money that
you'll be able to own a house in a major
metropolitan area
have a new car
be able to go on a family vacation once
or twice a year and pay for your kids
college
nowadays for that same type of lifestyle
it would make me 200 000 dollars a year
and most working professional jobs
even for college graduates today
outside of wall street or very high
performance based compensation
industries and maybe doctors and lawyers

[07:00]
industries and maybe doctors and lawyers
i put the exceptions to the
professional salary usually ranges
between 60 to 160 k
the higher end of the corporate job
ladder maybe in the low 200s
but
in most cities like the other than maybe
having a little bit of extra money for
savings and a bigger budget to go on
vacations if you're a single
person
60k to 160k is not that much different
in terms of
material lifestyle quality
and so
if the upside of working hard is maybe
an extra five to twenty thousand dollars
a year but it doesn't really move the
needle in terms what you need to save
for the down payment of a house
or
to just materially consistently improve
your lifestyle
why bother working the extra amount for
the promotion where you probably get
more hours and more stress
for not enough pay and no real material
change

[08:00]
change
in your lifestyle and i think
progressive taxation
and bracket creep where the tax brackets
don't rise as fast as
uh
real underlying inflation due to them
being tied to cpi
the after tax income from these marginal
gains
is even less
so
to say you are in the 30 percent tax
bracket
and you make an extra ten thousand
dollars a year that's really an extra
seven thousand dollars per year after
tax
is an extra seven thousand dollars per
year going to move the needle to put in
an extra 5-10 hours a week
for most people the answer is no and
that is why quiet quitting is more
popular i think white quitting problem
could easily be fixed if you do
one of four things
and only one of them was really in the
control of a business owner the others
are more
macroeconomic or government policy ones

[09:01]
macroeconomic or government policy ones
so we'll start with the ones that
concerned business owners can't really
do anything about the first one is you
would need to have
a dramatic crash in the labor market
which
if you raise interest rates in the high
enough that could happen
and if workers have less bargaining
power than the quiet quitting
is not very viable anymore
the second thing that could happen
is that you would cut the welfare state
and other social protections that make
it easier for people to be comfortable
just slacking off on their job
given the current political climate
that's very unlikely that that would
happen
the third thing you could do is have
real wages rise by 50
or more
and keyword is real here like if you had
nominal wages go up that much
and all that money just goes into higher
rents or higher food or higher gas

[10:00]
rents or higher food or higher gas
prices it's not going to do any good it
doesn't solve the problem
but that's difficult how do you raise
the wage scale for everybody
without resulting in collective
inflation
i mean there are ways to bring down the
labor supply without bringing down the
supply of other goods and services in
certain industries
but wages are a big driver inflation i
think the most effective way to do this
would be to
drastically increase the housing supply
and cause the housing market to tank
because that's 30 to 40 percent
of most consumers budgets
and if
housing was in real terms the same cost
as it was in this 80s or 90s
then
the money that was previously being used
to cover rent or mortgage payments
is now free to be other parts of the
economy and people won't feel poor
anymore
and
as a result
either quiet quitting go away because
hey look i can actually afford to buy a

[11:01]
hey look i can actually afford to buy a
house anymore look i can save enough
money to really get ahead whether it's
to retire start a business or whatever
so that's the from a macro prudential
policy perspective
reallocating disposable income away from
all going to landlords and banks
who own mortgages to other parts of the
economy
would
fix it but that's due to the house of
the strength of the housing lobby and a
lot of structural factors there that's
not an overnight solution
and the one that business owners could
really apply to fix quiet quitting
would be
to
rewire pay so that the success of the
company
actually matters to an employee's bottom
line
there are some industries that are very
good at this particular industry i come
from which is
wall street finance if you work in
investment bank or hedge fund or private

[12:01]
investment bank or hedge fund or private
equity firm and your fund does well or
your trading desk does well
or your team at the bank does well
you're going to get paid you're going to
get a fat bonus
because
it was because of your efforts
that you were able to generate those
returns or close those deals
and wall street for all the christmas it
gets the people work there are very
aware of how much they are worth
and so
that's why they're able to get paid on
what they're worth
we need to spread that to other
industries i mean there are some like
people working sales they get paid
commissions based on what they sell
but if you spread this kind of mentality
that
i have some sort of control and
ownership
in my pay
then you're gonna have people work a lot
harder
and as a business owner you would
benefit from this too because you would
make more money from having a more

[13:01]
make more money from having a more
productive workforce so say for example
instead of paying all your employees a
average of a base salary of a hundred
and thirty thousand dollars a year
you pay them a base instead of
90 to 100k
but you give bonuses that range anywhere
from
ten thousand to a hundred thousand
depending on how well the company does
and how well your individual performance
of the employee is
some it's easy to quantify like if you
have a p l on a trading desk or you're a
sales guy and have a quota you could
quantify
that for it for jobs that are more
administrative or harder to quantify
there will have to be other benchmarks
that are created
and it's up to
management theorists and consultants to
kind of come up with the details on this
but i figured there would be at least
some metric to show how
this employee does benefit the bottom

[14:00]
this employee does benefit the bottom
line
even if it's just cutting costs
like if but the problem is
if you can't measure that and there's no
evidence that this employee does create
any value whether in terms of increasing
the top line or increasing the bottom
line through reducing costs
then why is this person even working at
your company
like it would probably result in leaner
workforces in the short term when the
people who are just sitting at the pool
and
playing around their smartphone when
they're saying they're working remotely
will get axed
and or people in unproductive jobs that
didn't really have much of a role other
than showing up and
sending a few emails will be reorganized
to places that they are more productive
and if you are an employer and you
really want to
cut costs or find a way to give bonuses
to the people who do things that are
more of a cost side of the business
then you can incentivize like okay if

[15:01]
then you can incentivize like okay if
you find a way anywhere in the company
to cut costs without hurting the
productivity of the firm and the quality
of the goods and services delivered by
the firm
then you should be paid a bonus as a
percentage of the savings like if you
told every back office staff member for
every
place you're able to cut costs
will reimburse you 25 percent of the
cost savings and give it to you as a
salary bonus
then your staff's gonna be
incentivized a lot more
to
be willing to cut costs
and i think you can do that too
with
time as well as money so say if you have
employees who really just have bought
into the work to live ethos
of the french
and
just they don't really want the extra
money they just want six or seven weeks
of vacation look if you get all the
years work done

[16:01]
years work done
in 10 months
i'll give you an extra two months of
vacation on top of your
standard two weeks like i'll let you
take every day off thanksgiving there's
probably plenty of industries maybe not
retail or finance
that you could take the entire
december off in more the clerical side
of things at least
and not really miss a beat again i'm not
an expert in every industry
a consultant if i trade that's not my
background but
you could
a clever manager could reward their
employees
by
just saying hey look if you get your
work done for the month maybe if you
need them every month you can't let them
take off the entire month of december
but just say hey look you get all of
your months assignments they'll give
them to you in the first of the month
you get them all done by
three weeks in you can take the fourth
week off
or you can get a performance bonus

[17:01]
or you can get a performance bonus
and do more
like that there's there's ways we get
creative with this to reengage the
workforce and i really think it's
not just what management says oh the
boss is just me and hurts people's
feelings or there's not sufficient
like
ping pong tables or community gatherings
or any other typical corporate stuff
it's more i think just that people feel
like they're not getting paid enough to
go above and beyond this is more
economic but you don't like really to
hear say that because paying employees
is expensive and business owners don't
like to get a solution oh you need to
give everybody a raise
so that's my thoughts on this quiet
quitting thing
uh let me know what you think are the
solutions to quiet quitting am i off
about this is it really just a
s like a psyche and psychological
motivation problem more than a
dollars and cents problem or i believe
it to be
i'd love to hear your feedback
