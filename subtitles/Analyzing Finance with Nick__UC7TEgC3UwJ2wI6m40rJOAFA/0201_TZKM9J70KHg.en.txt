[00:00]
in August of
2021 what if alt hist released a video
on his channel titled why are we going
to be a Great Depression within 3 years
my reaction to that very video is really
what helped this channel build its
initial and now rapidly growing audience
where I criticized the idea that the
economy even with its structural issues
is nowhere close to anything like the
Great Depression in the 1930s and Niko
is not going to get there for decades if
at all now we're almost three years
later in July
2024 and despite some ugly structural
issues remaining in the economy even on
the worst case scenario we're nowhere
near the Great Depression in fact really
the good analogy if you want to make for
the bare case for the economy is a more
mild version of the 1970s and if you
asked anybody 19 30 they would easily

[01:01]
asked anybody 19 30 they would easily
take a mild version of the 1970s over
the SLO that decade was back then and to
celebrate this he released a video
called what WTF is wrong with the
economy and I know a lot of my viewers
have wanted me to make more what if all
his reactions but he's gone into more
esoteric stuff that's not really
relevant to my expertise which is
economics and the financial markets but
now with this video it's time for me to
share my thoughts so what is really
truly wrong with the economy let's get
started this is how I feel about the
economy today it's become a cultural
meme of how what the economy is on paper
is nowhere close to what the reality is
I mean just look outside for Christ's
sake on paper our economy is fine that
being said if you look at anything else
it's so clear that that's not the case
yeah I mean it depends on what numbers
you're looking at because yeah honest
surface level nominal GDP looks great

[02:02]
surface level nominal GDP looks great
real GDP looks decent that's really
simply because there's one number that
is inaccurate and that is inflation and
there I've mentioned several of my
videos in the past particularly the way
they use owners equivalent rent and how
the government uses survey data versus
realtime data for a lot of in pieces of
the inflation calculation that inflation
numbers are structurally understated
whether they're a more cynical reason
for that to keep things such as Social
Security down and tax brackets that are
index to inflation lower than they would
be otherwise I'll leave that to the
comment section to decide but based on
my history of running research that kind
of measures what the actual cpis based
on private sector data versus the
government sector estimates from the BLS
it's the trend is usually similar but on
a Cally adjusted basis the average
average gap between the private sector

[03:02]
average gap between the private sector
data and the government data is about
35% that number can be wider when times
are good and the econom is expanding and
the free market be be deflating when
recessions when the government doesn't
really catch that part but if you smooth
it out when the government says it's 2%
inflation is probably closer to 2.7 that
doesn't sound like a lot but when you
compound that over 30 years makes a real
difference to the cumulative price level
but
other parts of economic data are fairly
accurate and the thing he is catching on
is a lot of the media in order to defend
the current economic record of this
Administration is gaslighting a lot of
people into saying oh inflation really
isn't that bad it's not hurting you or
the econom is actually great because of
some raw aggregate numbers even though
the Distribution on who's benefiting
from this economy is in a way that would
be very socially unpopular example would
be like in 20 22 when we had two

[04:01]
be like in 20 22 when we had two
straight quarters of Contracting GDP and
all of a sudden the narrative was in
denial on whether there was a recession
or not if you had two declining quarters
of GDP in a row under say the president
trump it would have been all over the
place there it would have been oh we're
in such an awful recession and they
would spin it the other way whereas the
conservative media would be saying the
opposite oh that definition of recession
is tentacle and Arcane so a lot of it is
politically driven and since it was the
Democrats in charge you had the opposite
narrative the mainstream media said oh
the definition of recession is Arcane
and the conservative media saying yeah
we are in recession so that's kind of
what he's pointing out is true there is
a elite SL media Collective gaslighting
against middle class America about the
condition of the economy let's start
with part one the flaws of the data the

[05:01]
with part one the flaws of the data the
flaws of data in my video on Modern
civilization I talked about how the
greatest sin of modernity is confusing
the measurement of something with the
thing itself GDP is the economy
happiness metrics are happiness
increasing your statistical number is
what growth in a good government looks
like yeah I mean he's going to probably
say something like oh GDP growth is not
a true measure of happiness the problem
is is that you can't really quantify
happiness there's a country in East Asia
Bhutan which tries to measure instead of
gross domestic product on its economic
success on gross national happiness and
I think it's to really cover up the fact
that Bhutan is a struggling economy with
really not that much growth prospects
and so they need to find some other way
to justify their ruling classes right to
rule and with this I think the best
measure is probably chap P per capita

[06:01]
measure is probably chap P per capita
which is the GDP per person because if
you have and I'm adjusted for for the
inflation because if you just do nominal
GDP then inflation can make look like
it's always growing even when it's
recession and if you don't do GD per
capita as a metric then if you just
flood a country with immigrants GDP will
increase just because there's a lot more
people here but if the average person is
poor the and the collective economy
grows that doesn't mean standard living
is going up in fact to means the exact
opposite so yeah it's you can't really
blindly use a number but G per capita
which is a proxy for individual incomes
is the best I think of the major
economic data numbers to calculate
well-being this is the issue we run into
with the economy in which people believe
official numbers before anything else
this opens up a yeah but if you just
base it on feel or Vibes of your
individual life that can also que it

[07:00]
individual life that can also que it
like there's a lot of people who are
depressed now because of the great
social depression which I'll I talked
about in a previous video and just
because your life is going bad or that
you're sad doesn't mean that the whole
economy sucks even if everybody your
friends or family he's going to go into
like yeah I lived in the rust Bell and
the rust Bell is deteriorating but that
for every rust Bel there's a Florida or
a Texas or California who have been at
least until fairly recently in the case
of California have been growing and
there's a lot of nice and new things
being constructed all the time so you
you can't look at it just from your own
Regional or individual preferences like
that's the biggest mistake you can make
as an investor and I've made it too is
like I didn't buy a stock or I didn't
short a stock because my sentiment
whether my use of the product was very
different than the national average

[08:01]
different than the national average
person using it and I I placed my
sensibilities on the general public as a
mistake and data is used to aggregate
that and to try to take out that local
bias a very clear issue with modern
logic in which we have no grounding in
reality and thus it's very easy to get
us to believe absurdities an easy
example of this is arguing that culture
has no effect on society and thus you
can mix different populations together
with no consequences alternately that
there are no real differences between
men and women thus you can change one
for the other these are things which the
rest of History the thing is though
economics you can't live in denial like
you can of Sociology like I mentioned in
my video I did reacting to Neil Ferguson
where I discussed that his comparison to
the late Soviet era to the current
United States and the one point that he
that I got from it is that the Soviet
Union with its top- down communist

[09:00]
Union with its top- down communist
system was in denial the basic laws of
economics and with our current social
climate and political narrative you have
our political Elites and Academia and a
lot of the ivy Le class for a l a better
term are in complete denial of basic
sociology there can't be a denial of
Economics because there's things such as
the bond market and stock market and
corporate earnings and the value of the
currency and body prices and a lot of
other things that make you aware that
your economic theories are wrong the
stock markets aren't perfectly
correlated with the economy but there
are corners of the financial markets
whether it's in the rates Market or
Commodities or stocks that will point to
something wrong in the economy if there
is and the a lot of the flows for the
stock market is driven by 401ks whether
it's people funding their 401ks or when
times are bad drawing down because they
lost their job to cover their expenses

[10:01]
lost their job to cover their expenses
and so that's why the stock market has
somewhat of a correlation also the stock
markets S&P 500 is a multiple of
earnings per share those tend to go up
during good Economic Times American
Healthcare System is legendarily
inefficient but it's ranked as good
since it creates more economic growth
due to being so inefficient yeah I
talked about that in a series of videos
I did with a health care focused venture
capitalist about the inefficiency of the
healthcare I don't think really anybody
is saying that the Health Care system is
great because it's inefficient it might
be a source of middle class jobs and
that and or jobs that employ people with
degrees who otherwise wouldn't have
anything to do yeah there's a lot of
bureaucracy in the medical industry and
it's kind of a a make workor program
that doesn't mean it's effective in fact
most of our healthc care debate on both
sides that I don't think that the
current system is bad and it's whether
they want to switch it to a more
socialized system or more of a pure

[11:01]
socialized system or more of a pure
market system and not this weird hybrid
that we have now so there this I think
he's wrong of saying that the health
care industry is a good example in fact
people complain that 177% of GDP versus
10 to 11% other developed countries is a
problem and a sign of inefficiency not a
sign of how great and how much of a
growth driver Health Care is for the
economy however after thinking about
more closely I think that red yard is
exaggerating this too first of all
there's a large black market in every
developed economy including the US
economy for various service Services
legal or illegal the non-financial
transactions also you have those among
families too in other countries however
that might be changing through a
phenomenon called buying the village
which I'm going to discuss in a future
video and then the third one which I
think is the weakest of this is that

[12:01]
think is the weakest of this is that
there is a measurement it's called G per
capita adjusted for purchasing power
parody Or PPP which honestly this does
the other way around it underestimates
the size of the US economy because it
says that the costs are that much lower
in other places than the US economy is
like the US also has such a vary to
purchasing power per depending where you
live what's the proper discount that you
give a country relative to the US on
that in theory yeah that makes sense but
in practice though I still like using
the nominal GDP because it it is the
actual production of goods and services
especi but I I still think on a per
person basis but there is some valid
points here Kenya's eony might be I
don't know 1.2 to 1.5 times the size of
what it claims but to be like 6X is bit
a hyperbole able to use statistics to

[13:01]
a hyperbole able to use statistics to
lie to the American public to say that
their lives were getting better
economically even as a teenager I could
listen to my parents talk about what
America was like in their youth or watch
older movies and it was clear that
things had gotten worse economically for
normal people again it's all just
anecdotes there's there is a re the G
per C has improved the globalization
though really kind of start to kick off
with NAA and several other free trade
agreements that happened in the Clinton
Administration which caused what I call
the the elephant curve in wages globally
where you had the bottom 70% of their
wages rapidly go up and the top 10%
rapidly go up but the 80th and 90th perc
all went down because these were the
equivalents of the working class and the
lower middle classes in developed
economies and yeah that particular group
did get hit through globalization
and Outsourcing the internet creating

[14:02]
and Outsourcing the internet creating
more winter take all economy but that
doesn't mean that for everybody life was
worse off however there was a specific
Niche whose needs were heavily ignored
and that was that helped Drive president
Trump's victory in 2016 that being said
whenever I brought up these points
people would jump down my throat due to
rises in total GDP the party line was
the average American's life had gotten
better since the 1970s the reality is
that if you adjust for cost of living
normal Americans lives had gotten vastly
poorer since well this chart kind of is
somewhat misrepresenting because yeah
you did have from 2000 to 2016 a real
wage decline across the board and if you
look priced in Gold it looks even worse
than this chart but basically since 2016
you've seen wages come back up in a very
strong way even on a real basis are they
wor they at their Peak
before the 70s no but the situation

[15:02]
before the 70s no but the situation
isn't really first is that the elites
are very good at skewing official
numbers to show the exact opposite of
what's going on in the real world
they're also good at keeping up the
facade for decades in large part since I
think a majority of the ruling class
unironically believes The Narrative of
any given time that is a bold assertion
to make and I'm not saying that it's not
necessarily true but thing I've been
disappointed honestly in this video is
you don't explain how they're doing it
like at least with the inflation data in
my reaction I explained you how that can
be manipulated it's just the way that
it's measured through things such as Oar
but in your case here you do not really
mention any examples in this video of
how the data is being manipulated you're
just kind of emotionally have a gut
feeling saying hey yeah I think the data
is off because it doesn't reflect my own
fing experience erience nor the living

[16:00]
fing experience erience nor the living
experience of my Social Circles or the
fact that the price level is high and
I'm it's caused a lot of people to
struggle yeah I mean I'm not going to
deny your own experiences and your
surroundings but I do want and anybody
who's skeptical of data and even I'm
skeptical of some of the economic data
but I don't really go out and assert
that in a public way for data points
where I can't really pinpoint how it's
kind of like yeah sure you can say
something something's wrong with the car
but if you don't know the mechanics and
how and the process of what is causing
the car to dysfunction and I and apply
that analogy of the mechanics of the car
to economic data and this is kind of my
biggest criticism of Rudyard in this
video want to be totally transparent I'm
not an economist my strength is in
history and anthropology yeah I can tell
is I'm not going to repeat your entire
last several minutes of this video but

[17:00]
last several minutes of this video but
you basically were gaslighting your
audience to saying our society is
schizophrenic and makes up narratives
all the time and is in denial and like I
said previously yeah sure that's an
interesting claim and yeah there are
political narratives I'm not going to
get into that Machinery because I'm an
economics and financial expert but in
terms civically you didn't you failed to
really highlight how you just accuse
anybody who questions your Narrative of
the economy a priori is gaslighting and
You by you are indirectly gaslighting
your audience who might be critical of
this we are the society in history which
has given the economists the most social
Authority this is where I would also
challenge you I do not think we are the
society that has given the economists
the most social Authority the economists
are just put there to justify political
goals of politicians we give politicians

[18:00]
goals of politicians we give politicians
the most authority of any really Society
at least democratically elected
politicians and example of this would be
mmt and I talked about this in a video
called macroeconomics is always
political and I'll have links to all of
these in the description and cards as
many as I can fit and what I talk about
that point is that things such as mmt
and supply side economics were
philosophies created to justify a policy
initiative that the political parties or
given candidate already wanted like it
wasn't that Stephanie Kelton was the
most influential member of society and
drove that idea it was that Stephanie
Kelton became influential because she
created the justification for Bernie
Sanders to pursue his economic policies
and create a narrative that would
justify his campaign promises that
without destroying the economy same with
art laugher and the supply side

[19:00]
art laugher and the supply side
economics on the right they weren't the
ones who were pushing Ronald Reagan to
pursue a small government agenda where
you cut taxes faster than spending it
was that Ronald Reagan needed an
economic hypothesis and theory to
justify what he wanted to do anyway and
that's what the role of the economist
really has been since the second world
of Wars they've basically been the
rubber stamp for politicians to
instigate what ever economic policy they
wanted to do anyways or influence but as
they'll gradually see over the course of
this video at the same time we are
making some of the most profoundly
stupid decisions of any society ever in
history economically I have a friend
who's a professional Economist and
statistician who works at a think tank
who I was talking to he said that neural
people's quality of life has remained
constant since Co I told him that was
completely ridiculous and there was even
though I just kind of criticized red
yard about his anecdotal evidence I mean

[20:03]
yard about his anecdotal evidence I mean
for anybody it is pretty clear that the
average person's quality of life has not
really gone up since the pandemic even
if nominal statistics say that and again
the one statistic I think measurement
that is truly broken is inflation that's
probably what this economist Think Tank
missed to be honest with you is at the
worst Point ever people today Sleep the
least are the fattest most depressed
suicidal they have less sex are more
mentally ill marry the least and have
the least children and even stuff like
height is declining by every single
metric which would show the human
character of society we are massively
failing the thing is that a lot of these
statistics are directly related to the
economy although there are other
variables well I think that he is
conflating the social depression with
economic depression and I think that the
irony is is that people being sad and

[21:01]
irony is is that people being sad and
miserable is good for the economy not
bad for the economy and I talked about
this in a video where I talk about who
profits from the great social depression
and if you look at there study that came
out in 2009 that psychologists were
basically able to rule find out that
people who are depressed are more likely
to spend and spend impulsively and
higher amounts than people who are me
mentally healthy and there were probably
some marketers at social media companies
and Internet advertising companies who
found this study and ran with it because
the social media algorithm does a very
good job at making people feel miserable
and unhappy and feel like they need to
spend to catch up to the ghosts of their
peers who are highlighting the best
parts of their lives on Instagram or by
the rich and famous who lives are
previously more private are now out in

[22:01]
previously more private are now out in
public bragging or pretending to brag in
case of lot of phony rich people how
best better they are than everybody else
and this Rat Race that has been created
by everybody constantly comparing each
other causes more consumption and that
more and that greater amount of
consumption drives economic growth to be
higher than it would be otherwise when
an economy is supposed to be
deleveraging in the 2010s so and also
like all these disp beare deaths or
excess use of vices that's also
paradoxically good for the economy
because people are spending more on
those and those cause health problems
which lead to people having to spend
more money into the Health Care system
which Drive GDP up does it make the
average person happy no but economic
growth actually does better when people
are more miserable and act on that
misery so he's actually maybe proving
why the economy has been more resilient
than it should be and why people are so

[23:01]
than it should be and why people are so
willing to spend beyond their their
means if people are economically
stressed every single thing gets worse
it's impossible to have a society which
is doing economically well and then have
the issues seen above I just explained
about 30 seconds ago why you can have
all those issues and the economy do well
majority of Americans can't pay a $1,000
emergency Bill okay I've seen this
statistic that Americans can't pay
anywhere from a $ 4400 to a $1,000
emergency bill this data is published
but every year in my Adult Career I
could probably find data going back to
at least
2009 maybe not longer I'll put in the in
a little caption here was the earliest
year that I was able to find this
statistic and still be true but America
is a sinker swim Society it always has
been if that's kind of what allows our
economy more Dynamic and grow faster
than places such as Europe but at the

[24:00]
than places such as Europe but at the
same time it also makes it a lot harder
for those who are struggling here it's a
doggy dog Country and this is just a
reflection about it and if they had data
back even further I bet this was true
for most of pre-World War II History 2
so yeah I always kind of been suspicious
of this particular data point 40% can't
pay a $400 emergency bill when pulled
the vast majority of Americans say they
just can't afford basic life stuff gen Z
has 90% less spending power than the
Baby Boomers did at yeah that is a
problem if you look at Chen Z actually
wages adjusted for inflation they've
done better than the x's and the
Millennials at the same age they may
have not as the Boomers and a lot of
this is also driven by housing and we
have a structurally messed up housing
bubble which I think will eventually be
corrected with demographics as the
Boomers start to age and they leave a

[25:04]
Boomers start to age and they leave a
lot of properties that are going to be
up for sale right now the real estate
market is basally Boomers selling to
other Boomers because they're the ones
who have the home equity or the cash to
make all of these purchases but once and
the I've seen a statistics that say as
much as half of the housing stock is
owned by people over 55 and a third is
own by people over 65 and so once that
kind of moves through the system you'll
probably see a waterfall down in housing
prices because there simply won't be a
bid and then on top of that these
boomers are not only if people own the
houses but they're the same ones voting
for The nimi policies and so they will
lose a lot of political will to
artificially restrain the housing Supply
like that's been going on for a while
I'll discuss this in a two-part series I
did called housing is an expensive
you're just poor that goes into the math
and the numbers for this but that's
really ultimately it's going to end up
we've seen this already happen in Japan
and in some European countries such as

[26:01]
and in some European countries such as
Italy and it will eventually I think
happen here too it just be a little bit
delay due to a younger average age in
America relative to other developed
countries the same age normal Young
Americans spend 2third of their income
on rent America today has the lowest
social Mobility it has ever had in its
history at the top 20 universities in
America you yeah the social Mobility is
a real issue like I've seen statistics
that 50% % of people 35 have a lower
income adjust for inflation than their
parents whereas if you compare it to
1985 it was only 20% of people 35 had
lower income adjusted for inflation than
their parents even worse for recent
increases in cost of living the cost of
housing or rentals have nearly doubled
since Co at this yeah he's right about
this part too it's that the cost of the
things that the government has
intervened in the most which is
education
healthare and housing have gone up way

[27:01]
healthare and housing have gone up way
faster than overall inflation whereas
the stuff that people don't necessarily
need like luxury goods cars Furniture
Telecom Video Games Etc have gone way
down because one they're less regulated
two you've got easier to make Unlimited
Supply especially more digital things
and three when people don't have the
money for them they get simply cut back
whereas you can't really decide I'm not
to save money or not get an education to
save money it's it's not as easy of a
choice however with the college one
since basically 2016 College adjusted
for inflation has basically been flat as
the there have been more Alternatives
developing there and people are aware
that the economics of college versus the
income you expect to make out of it
doesn't match as well and I did a video
about this also called is color is worth
it if you want to see my further more

[28:01]
it if you want to see my further more
detailed thoughts about that the same
time Basic Essentials like food have
gone up 50% since Co wages have
stagnated this means that in a lot of
ways people are living on what is really
half the income they had before Co which
was a terrible standard of living
beforehand is okay that's a stretch to
say people are living half of what they
were before Co even if you use very
anti-government levels of CPI estimates
let's just say the CPI has gone up 40%
real wages over that same time has gone
up say about 20 to 25% so using just
like the most Steel Man numbers to
defend what if all his you see maybe
that workers have gone a collective 20%
haircut that's still really bad but it's
nowhere near people losing half their
income inflation is effectively a tax on
the poor who need physical money and
exchanging it for the upper classes well
it's everybody loses from inflation even

[29:01]
it's everybody loses from inflation even
the upper classes their bond portfolios
Get Wrecked because rates go up and
their costs of maintaining their
property go up faster than the
properties go up in value because if
there if inflation goes high too high
that's bad for real estate in the long
run because people won't be able to
afford to buy a house above a certain
price but your costs go up faster than
housing appreciation ation you still
lose like the 70s was the worst stretch
of inflation and adjust for inflation
how it housing did terrible in the 1970s
and you look at stocks stocks do well in
the early part of inflation when
monetary policy first eases and the
market resets for lower interest rates
but as inflation goes from just mildly
High to very high stocks do terribly
like we had a whole Bare Market in 2022
where the indices went down more than
20% even though there was technically no

[30:01]
20% even though there was technically no
recession or a very mild one and the
stock market lost 25% of its value
because of the inflation crunching
consumers and hurting inflation adjusted
earnings per share that's one example in
the 70s the stock market did terrible
you had years where inflation was really
high and the stock market have crashes
of 30% or more and in real terms the
stock market lost over half of its value
in a decade because of high inflation
valuation multiples go down if inflation
remains persistent in the short term
again it looks good and in the bad in
the long term it's bad for asset holders
of all kinds the people who win the most
from the inflation are not necessarily
the wealthy but it's actually the poor
or the wealthy who got their wealth
through overleveraging themselves
because their debts get inflated away
that they borrowed when inflation was
low at lower interest rates and a lot of

[31:00]
low at lower interest rates and a lot of
the poor are on social assistance or
work at bare subsistence wages anyway
and those tend to actually go up faster
or in Pace with inflation otherwise
people simply won't work and the
political will to not hand own social
assistance which is often in physical
services or housing subsidies or things
and not in cash those become relatively
more
valuable like you look at why Germany
The Losers of inflation with the upper
middle class and the middle class if you
look at places like Venezuela it's the
same thing the stock market there did
really well the first five years the
2010s when high to hyperinflation was
running rampant but then in 2016 it lost
more than 90% of its value in real terms
and so it works with inflation and asset
prices it's more of a it works until it
doesn't one's inflation breaks a certain
threshold and the markets afraid that it
will stay there all the early gains from
inflation from asset holders get kind of

[32:01]
inflation from asset holders get kind of
taken away very quickly who own real
estate or stocks which are more so
hedged against inflation as an example
of the elite skewing the statistics they
have kept inflation numbers artificially
Low by taking out any metrics that
people actually use the inflation is
often the highest on the things that
people need to survive for example for
younger or lower class Americans 2third
of their money goes to rent yeah
inflation rates very differently by age
which is why a lot of economists miss
the problem because a lot of these
establishment Elite people are 50 plus
they bought their house a long time ago
so their mortgage is either very cheap
or it's fully paid off they've already
sent their kids to college so they don't
have that expense anymore and the things
that they spend money on like airfare to
travel to places or hotels or
Electronics or other like discretionary
items are flat to declining in price so

[33:01]
items are flat to declining in price so
and they're on Medicare so a lot of
their health care expenses are going
down too because they don't longer have
to pay as high premiums so for an old
person your inflation is probably flat
might even be deflationary however for a
young person now has to buy that house
at much higher prices has to go to
college at that much higher prices and
the cost of raising a kid is a lot
higher too because of Education child
care and a variety of other things and
have to pay those inflation prices your
inflation rate is probably double digits
and I did an interview of real Vision
back in 2019 explaining this dilemma and
that's where you see a lot of the
disconnect is that younger Generations
face a much higher inflation rate than
older Generations who used ladder
polling to kind of protect themselves
but the consequences of that economic
ladder polling was a harder life for
succeeding Generations between the lived
reality and the statistics there was an
assessment of what the average amount of
money needed to have a comfortable
family life like the kind of Simpsons

[34:01]
family life like the kind of Simpsons
used to have and the cost goes from 300
people make the mistake of using The
Simpsons analogy CU The Simpsons lived I
think in a town based on Springfield
Illinois or Missouri and that's if you
still want to live in Springfield
Illinois today you can still buy a house
for under
$200,000 it's still cheap there like and
yeah he was considered lower middle
class but that was kind of kind of a
lower middle class town and it was cheap
back then and it's cheap now like if
Homer Simpson lived in early
1990s Los Angeles or Chicago even it
would be a very different scenario
$1,000 in California to
$170,000 in Mississippi of money needed
to support a middle class life has
jumped from around 60k before Co to 100K
today and that's a that's about right I
don't even think 60k was before Co I

[35:01]
don't even think 60k was before Co I
would say it was more like 75k before Co
but yeah it's it's a lot more expensive
to have a middle class life he's clearly
right only about 10% of Americans make
over 100k and what that means indirectly
just so the statistic that 18% of
Americans make more than 100K so I don't
really you're you're kind of missing the
point here is that 90% of the popul is
lower class which is not what a first
world country should look like in that
that's what the Congo or Medieval Europe
were like we 90% of the population are
peasants and the top 10% are the and a
lot of that is also factoring in a lot
of retirees don't work and live off
their assets and as the Boomers continue
to get older and retire and they're
going to have less reported income
especially if they invest in lower tax
things such as municipal bonds you're
going to see a lot more more consumption
and maybe an artificially declining

[36:01]
and maybe an artificially declining
consu savings rate because a lot of
people are going to be net Spenders or
net drawers of savings because they are
retiring and so yeah but is it true that
more people are living kind of
peasant-like Lifestyles today
particularly among Millennial and j z
yeah is is it to say that 90% of America
is absolutely not like even with all the
prohibit High housing costs the home
ownership rate is still between 55 to
60% of the population in the United
States which is far from peasants
there's no really food shortages in this
country a lot of Creature Comforts that
people take for granted are a lot better
today so and then but the thing is yeah
in the current term yeah there's going
to be a major consumer crunch because
people's cost of living is going up
faster than wages basically since
2021 and they have to since they have to
spend more money of things like rent and
food and gas and Necessities health

[37:02]
food and gas and Necessities health
insurance there's going to be less money
to spend on discretionary items and that
pullback is going to cause a recession
even if jobs stay up say like if you
have the unemployment rate stay flat but
you have due to inflation real wages
decline by 10% that's the same net
effect as the unemployment rate going up
2% in terms of loss of spending power so
I think we could see a recession that
surprisingly has a strong labor market
at the same time because of that very
Dynamic you may have less people losing
their jobs but the jobs simply just
don't pay as well so there's less
spending power in the economy I can't
even quantify it and I don't believe the
numbers but I heard that it took us 250
years to reach the levels of debt we had
in 2014 well I mean with inflation
especially if you think the if CPI is
higher than the government claims it to
be a lot of this money is not really

[38:02]
be a lot of this money is not really
worth as much as it looks normally of
course you going have more inflation
recent years than in the past just due
to money Printing and falling purchasing
power so the reason what economists
don't use nominal numbers of debt
because they don't really mean anything
instead you should really be using a
debt to GDP metric as the proper ratio
here but like because of inflation
though what is considered real GDP is a
lot different than what the debt is
being measured against and so if you
really adjust for a higher inflation
number the debt to GDP is high but it's
not nearly as bad as feared and the
national debt problem is going to be
solved it already has been solved our
leadership has made the decision of how
they're going to solve this and sadly
they are going to solve it through money
Printing and allowing inflation to be
higher than interest rates on average

[39:00]
higher than interest rates on average
over several business cycles and that's
how we quote unquote resolved inflation
in the 70s and the real risk for the
economy now is that we have a repeat of
that a milder version of the 70s and
this that's how this inflation just
moves through the pipe and how this debt
is being paid off like if you look at
just the increase in CPI since covid
we've already paid off all the stimulus
spending and I paid off in airor quotes
here through a high inflation inflating
the debt away so yeah the real risk
terms of national debt isn't the
national debt and the US government
being un able to pay it off there'll
always be dollars at least nominally to
pay off the debt it's just how long and
how high does inflation have to persist
before it causes social issues and civil
unrest and other things that is the real
risk of the national debt not the fact
the us is going to miss its payments but
more in the sense that the amount of
inflation needed to keep the part going
it's going to be too socially damaging

[40:01]
it's going to be too socially damaging
for civil society to maintain itself and
we have doubled the number since America
spends more money on paying off the
interest on its debt than the military
and keep yeah this is called the Neil
Ferguson indicator which I talked about
in that video that whenever a great
power has their interest expense exceed
their debt they no longer are the great
power and they usually have to
drastically cut their defense and their
commitments overseas we saw this with
the British Empire we saw this with
Soviet Union we saw this with Spanish
Empire and the French whenever their
interest expenses exceeded their defense
spending that's what really ultimately
did them in from a geopolitical
perspective who actually are part of
this process are intelligent enough to
know what's happening which is
completely insane given I think a lot of
people do understand this and your
explation of the Spanish Empire was not
money printing it was that since they

[41:00]
money printing it was that since they
found so much gold and silver in Latin
America through their exploration and
colonization of that region they brought
in too much of it at once and that
caused the inflation and their price
level to elevate it wasn't simply a
money printing issue it was they
literally increased the supply of hardge
species through their Conquest as
somebody who did study economics in
college I did we studied the history of
economic thought all the way back to the
ancient Greeks you study a lot of these
old economies maybe not as much as the
modern economies particularly
macroeconomics because that really
wasn't a field until kanes but to say
that people are historically ignorant of
the preor War II economy is especially
inaccurate and the people who are more
economically literate are the ones less
likely to be working at government
agencies and are more likely to be
active Market participants ask your
Economist or economics major friends who

[42:00]
Economist or economics major friends who
work on Wall Street Banks or hedge funds
and see if you get the same answer of
economic allcities particularly if they
work at a global macro focused shop I
think you'd get a very different answer
we are the society which has put the
most effort into teaching people
economics of any ever and I was that
doesn't mean that much like yeah but
economic the society that teach the
greatest effort to teach economics and
the requirement in High School is one
half a semester of an econ class that's
it and maybe in college some
universities require one quarter or one
semester of basic economics and most
schools don't even require that so the
that's a very low Benchmark L didn't
have an answer and you guys should watch
it where he just waffles he doesn't have
an answer because you can't publicly
admit the answer they have to inflate
away the debt to keep this government
spending going like if they try to

[43:01]
spending going like if they try to
balance the budget with austerity the
current economy would collapse like the
deficit is literally bigger than nominal
GDP as I'm speaking so that's a problem
and you can't say oh we're just having
to bail ourselves out publicly because
that would be a giant blow of confidence
in the financial markets would react
very harshly to that as somebody who
actually has power and influences that
if you were I said that nobody cares but
if drone Powell or the Secretary of the
Treasury came out and said the same
thing yikes in some ways our entire
Society is a reflection of our financial
system in which the government prints
infinite money as a way to escape
reality this kind of logic is reflected
in our entire clown World in which we
think that we are at the end of History
you can change your sex or that we're on
the verge of Utopia we've reached a
point in which the dominant economics
have system of our society is modern
monetary Theory which says that you can

[44:01]
monetary Theory which says that you can
print infinite money and somehow the
economy will grow faster mmt is a fringe
Theory really only a few Progressive
left-wing candidates have openly
endorsed and it was briefly experimented
in with some of these stimulus checks on
a very small level and it quickly
resulted in inflation and has since been
discredited you're giving way too much
credit to a theory that is more popular
among the terminally online than the
real world and again there's the coral
the V diagram between Bernie Sanders
supporters the terminally online mmt
Advocates have a very strong level of
intersections but yeah there an economy
does influence the psychology of the
people but the examples that he uses of
a lot of modern social issues are not
really how the economic Dynamics
influence the culture I think the way
the economic influences as low interest
rates have encouraged people to have
more short-term thinking and less

[45:01]
more short-term thinking and less
long-term thinking or if they do have
longterm thinking it's hyper long term
since there's no cost of capital so
that's why you see a lot of people
invest in the most speculative
technologies that may never deliver or
things that have no intrinsic value such
as cryptocurrency at the same time are
willing to blow their life savings on an
epic vacation to a Visa it's this like
it's either YOLO or I need the moonshot
because I'm not rewarded for my savings
in the medium term this might be
changing with interest rates being
elevated but almost 15 years of zero
rates have taught people not to save for
the medium term or to be financially
responsible because you're not you don't
get compensated for it there's you're
literally at zero interest rates and
with inflation that negative real so you
lost money by simply saving that's what
created the YOLO mentality the other one
is the whole reaction to the GFC and
occupy Wall Street and the idea that oh
since the big Banks got a bailout I

[46:01]
since the big Banks got a bailout I
deserve a bailout and that mentality
that like nobody should be allowed to
fail the government should print money
to keep stock prices and housing prices
up and because it does like you are
entitled to a certain level of returns
that that conditioned the Boomers to
extrapolate this idea because they had
to feel like the FED always had their
back and so it created this L sense of
inum that everybody deserves deserves to
always have their Investments go up
everybody deserves to be bail out
nobody's allowed to fail everybody has a
trophy Etc and then is that this theory
has been tested for thousands of years
governments have tried this money
printing in so many previous years of
History whether 17th century Spain 18th
century France 20th century Germany 3r
Century Rome 17th century China in
dozens of other times over history yeah
and you're correct that they all failed
and resulted in an era of high inflation

[47:01]
and resulted in an era of high inflation
and usually an economic recession and a
period of stagflation after that which
led to some sort of geopolitical
conflict the difference really is the
incentives for war are quite a bit
different now so if there is going to be
a great War it's more likely to be a
domestic Civil War than it is to be a
great power versus great power War
mainly due to the Advent of nuclear
weapons the result is always the same
but it blows up the entire Society
something I really loved about graber's
book is he called our society managerial
feudalism a small working class produces
the actual things of value and then it
is distributed among the managerial or
bureaucratic class that might be true in
some developed Nations that the
managerial class is bigger than the
working class producing things I still
think that the numbers are probably
slightly bigger for the working class
than the managerial class but if you
expand it on a global level the working
class globally still dwarfs the

[48:02]
class globally still dwarfs the
industrial the manager class as whole
happen to live in the same few countries
in the oecd club whereas the working
class is more concentrated in emerging
economies they run society and thus push
their own interests thus resulting in
the ever larger bureaucratic bloat you
see in every organization these people
often aren't necessary as we've seen
with Twitter where Elon fired 9 % of the
employees there with basically no
repercussions yeah I've mentioned that
example in my videos too I think it's
closer to 75% half laid off another 25%
quit don't quote me on that for the
exact numbers but the point's the same
like yeah there's a lot of big tech
companies and governments look at let's
see how Malay does with Argentina and
his plans for cutting government
spending in laying off workers and so
far based on the inflation data in
Argentina there's early signs that it's
worked the things that the government
has beholden to so many special
interests that they keep printing money

[49:01]
interests that they keep printing money
in order to keep everyone happy in a
rough scarce world so they can keep
getting reelected or maintain their
right to rule around the world today
governments stay in power by keeping the
economy good the problem is that this
pushes yeah that's effectively the
social contract everywhere whether it's
China the US India the Europe is that
the goal of society and the reason why
the ruling class has its right to rule
is that your children will have a better
life than their parents and that's
starting to break down a little bit
because a lot of countries you're seeing
younger Generations Millennials and
chenes particularly in developed
economies are having worse lives than
their parents and lower in inflation
adjusted incomes and if that social
contract breaks then really the entire
legitimacy of a lot of governments break
and that is very concerning especially
for countries in the emerging world
where they've started to see this happen

[50:02]
where they've started to see this happen
before their GB per capita gets high
enough that the society can insulate it
like it's one thing if like in Japan
where you have a lot of social cohesion
and living standards were high enough
that even if your living standards were
lower than your parents you still lived
in relatively comfortable life it's
another thing if the same thing happens
in a more developing Nation where they
haven't reached that level where a
downgrade from your parents life is
still a comfortable one that those are
the places that are most at risk for
seeing regime change for for that very
reason short-term mindsets and shortcuts
which eventually eat the entire system
the reason so much money printing has
resulted in less inflation than it
should warrant is that every government
in the world is doing this at the same
time since they're all desperate thus
everyone cancels everyone that's not
really less inflation that's just less
dollar weakness the the FED printing has
not increase the supply of goods and

[51:00]
not increase the supply of goods and
services unless we argue that lower
financing makes Commodities cheaper
because there's more money out there to
extract Commodities but the thing that's
really held inflation down is the
deflationary impact of moving
manufacturing and resource extraction to
a more globalized Market in the
countries where it's cheaper to do so
and then also the discovery of shale oil
opening a lot of energy Supply Shale
Natural Gas opening lot energy Supply
keeping energy cheap globalization
keeping labor cheap and thus
manufactured goods cheap that's what has
kept inflation down because money supply
growth has been High pretty much
everywhere so that's maybe why the
dollar has been relatively strong
because a lot of other parts of the
world are printing money a lot more
aggressively than the US and or keeping
rates down and the positive rate
differential support in the US but to
say that money printing prevents
inflation I think is like a

[52:00]
inflation I think is like a
misunderstanding the cause and effect
pattern else out leftists will see that
me saying this but the west or America
have not been capitalist since World War
II the reason I say this is that in
America or the Western countries in
general the government makes up half of
the total of no I mean even show in this
chart here which is a very good one
actually that the average percent of
government spending in the GDP is
probably closer to 4 40% how I think
some of these numbers are SKU I think
the US is a little bit lower than 35 and
a country like France which is above
well above 50% I don't even think I see
it on this chart really but that's kind
but in general even the EU average is 45
so it's still well under 50% so it's
still more the private sector than the
government driving the economy but
across the board all these numbers are
still way too high and what if all his
just absolutely correct that this is a
problem economy well before World War I

[53:01]
problem economy well before World War I
it hovered around 5% in Britain and
other similar countries the private
sector which is also the reason why it
was so low is because we didn't create a
lot of the make work jobs that the
government has done in its bureaucracy
since the Great Depression and also the
Great Depression brought on keynesianism
which believes that the government
should have a greater role in the
economy for better and worse and three
servicing the social safety net is a
large part of that government spending
and it's really a belief is should the
government be taking care of the lower
classes or not which is an entirely
different discussion that I if you look
at the elite with the WF as an example
they want to push this process further
with saying you will owe nothing and be
happy I think you're also overestimating
the power of the wef I mean the WF and I
also elaborated this in another video
their role is basically if you're a rich
person with a distasteful like antihuman
opinion or just something that you don't

[54:01]
opinion or just something that you don't
want to be directly tied to your name
but you think needs to be entered into
the policy discussion you will call
klouse and say hey look I think that the
world is too crowded I want to encourage
less people being born can you be my
mouthpiece for that cuz if I publicly
say it as some influential billionaire
person my personal reputation will go in
the mud whereas nobody cares about your
reputation or your organization really
because there's no one person I guess
schah but he's not really a actual
policy maker or have a business whose
revenues can be affected by having a bad
reputation so he's the one who takes the
metaphorical hit to get these people's
ideas out there without their personal
reputation of people paying them being
hurt if you know what I mean so yeah of
course you're going to have the world
economic form saying a lot of out of
touch things because their clients are

[55:00]
touch things because their clients are
out of touch people who don't want their
out of touch opinions match to them
directly alternately you notice the WF
types in the world economic forum is
generally a Weather Vein for the elites
across the West as they will always push
for renting or collectivism meanwhile
large corporations support regulations
since they Crush competitors it's only
one portion of the elite I did this in
my video of a social class in America
there are two ports there's the ones who
align with the establishment and want to
protect the way things are and there's
the upstarts the entrepreneurs the new
Elite who kind of built it themselves
and that tension is what progresses
American society so yeah definitely
those on the left half of the scale and
I'm not talking about just their
political views but just the the way I
drew the chart for this definitely have
a more view line that way and yeah a lot
of big companies they love regulation in
the sense because and same with old
money they love high taxes High state
taxes and high R barriers to entry so

[56:00]
taxes and high R barriers to entry so
that newer upstarts can't take their
places in the country clubs and on the
business level they don't new upstarts
can't take the place of the big
companies and really challenge them
incumbents always like to raise the
barriers to entry and pull the ladders
so that's not a surprise companies like
why is Disney making movies no one wants
to watch or why companies will go so
hard for woke people who make up 10 % of
America's population and a truly
minuscule amount of their Global Market
this is since their real aim is to get
funding from the big woke Finance firms
like Black Rock since they're no I mean
I think a lot of these people happen to
be in the woke demographic who are the
creative heads or especially in the
marketing side of things or a lot of
these big companies and they
overestimate their numbers and they also
the people who are more likely to line
with woke who are young people who have
relatively High income comes but low
propensity to save happen to be the

[57:00]
propensity to save happen to be the
bigger drivers of consumptions and the
more likely people to be influenced by a
commercial and spend whereas older
people with more conservative spending
habits tend to not listen to advertising
so it's not as effective on them and
therefore you're not going to appeal to
people who are not likely to have their
decision swayed by your marketing the
other thing is that is he's greatly
overestimating the power of Black Rock
and these ETFs they it's not that black
C decides on willy-nilly whether to
allocate to certain companies based on
how woke they are I mean there are ESG
funds but those are fading in popularity
and they were more driven by the E side
I did a reaction to Felix rex or black
pigeon Speaks video about this years ago
explaining this and also the power of
Black Rock but it's really just people
are buying index funds which is most of
the assets their management for these
big firms and the index funds hold a
little bit of a piece of everything and
it's black like the property manager
whereas you the person buying the ETF is

[58:00]
whereas you the person buying the ETF is
like the owner of the property just
because Black Rock manages your property
doesn't mean they own your apartment
building you own your apartment building
and it's the same people who buy these
ETFs you own the shares in the ETFs
based on how much of it you bought Black
Rock doesn't own them and so they show
up as the highest holder in a lot of
these things simply because they operate
the index funds and manage the index
funds that people are fling their 401ks
into and so that's where a lot of the
misunderstanding here comes it's a
little bit too long of a conversation a
lot of the topics he brings up here this
is why this video is going too long and
I likely have split it into multiple
Parts because of this is because each
one of these points that he just makes
this very overarching generous claim
cannot either be confirmed or refuted
without a much longer explanation is he
right that the economy is probably worse
than the media is claiming it is
absolutely as there some data that's off
yeah it's most likely inflation does
that mean that this is just some the

[59:00]
that mean that this is just some the
worst existential crisis and we are at
the same points as the collapses of
major civilizations absolutely not and
he's not presented enough in this video
other than his own intuitions to provide
any evidence really for that and then
that's kind of my wrap on this if you
have any comments or you disagree with
me feel free to write in the comments
and I'm going to make this a more lively
conversation I'll have all the videos
that I prer to cite it also in the
description and if R yard happens to be
watch this I'd love to talk to you about
this directly in a more open ended
conversation and try to see if you un if
I explain to you the more the deeper
economics of all a lot of these things
where would you still hold these views
where the change and where would your
Insight be able to point to some things
that I might be missing and a lot of
people in the financial industry might
missing missing their framework thank
you for watching everybody I hope you
like this this and happy 4th of July
