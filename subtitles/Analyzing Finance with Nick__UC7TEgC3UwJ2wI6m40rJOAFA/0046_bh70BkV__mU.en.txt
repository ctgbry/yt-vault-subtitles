welcome to analyzing finance with nick
a topic that's been very popular in the
news lately i mean i've seen it
everywhere from
the paranoias of the zero hedges of the
world
to even mainstream sources such as
tucker carlson on fox news
marching onto the bandwagon for this
hype that i'm going to discuss here and
that is the idea of
global food shortages and particularly
food shortages that are going to be so
bad in the united states that their
people are going to starve and the
grocery stores are going to be
completely empty because
there's just not enough food being
produced
because of what's going on in
geopolitically and in the commodities
market in general
however if you look at it
in any sort of objective manner
this is patently not true
and in the rest of this video i'm going
to debunk the great global food shortage

[01:00]
to debunk the great global food shortage
myth
[Music]
so according to the united nations
the definition of a food shortage is
when food supplies within a bounded
region do not provide the energy and
nutrients needed by that region's
population
simple as that
and that is in any developed country in
the world
and especially in the united states
that is not true
there is plenty of supply for food
it is true that we have inventories
at five year lows
and because of that we have higher
prices
high prices go up when demand with
grains at least is fairly constant
because people's appetite
doesn't change that much year over year
i mean there could be nutrition or
health trends like wheat struggled

[02:00]
health trends like wheat struggled
during the
gluten-free craze
and
corn had a little bit of a boost when
ethanol started to get added in
but there really isn't a lack of
available grains and therefore
a lack of
available meat for because there'll be
plenty of grains to be fed at the
animals and that's the thing actually
most grains particularly corn and
soybean
aren't even used
and for human consumption
they are used to either feed animals
or they are used for industrial uses
most notably
ethanol corn which is
by far
the most dominant use
of corn
in the united states
and
look well the reason for these concerns
are that
ukraine is a significant portion of
global grain production
now it's wheat exports

[03:01]
now it's wheat exports
in ukraine and russia combined are about
25 percent
of the total wheat crop that is shipped
overseas
and with corn ukraine russia is only
about one percent of corn but ukraine is
13.2
of the world's corn crop
so
yeah the risk of a war
cutting the supply off is very scary and
you've others see other variables such
as food prices already being in an
uptrend before this
and fertilizer price is going up 170
from
january 2021 to december 2021
and then during the pandemic you saw
grocery stores having a harder time
filling their shelves
so i'm gonna but the thing is that
even with all this
things that i mentioned that sound kind
of scary
we're nowhere close to a food crisis

[04:01]
we're nowhere close to a food crisis
and i'm gonna and there's a few reasons
why first let's just start with the
whole grocery store stalking thing with
the pandemic in natural disasters such
as hurricanes or
uh global pandemics
the reason why there's not food being
stocked on the shelves is not because
simply there is a lack
of food in the entire world i mean in
biblical times
famines often succeeded plagues which is
the old timey biblical word for
for pandemic was because
the people who would be working in the
fields
farming their food
died
from
the plague
but
the death rate was quite low
for
this recent pandemic
and on top of that
the farmers really were not
stopped for work in a material way for

[05:01]
stopped for work in a material way for
most of the time during the pandemic so
that's not
the reason there was a temporary
disruption where a lot of people were
just
out of fear to stay at home and you had
some economic attempts paying
people who would otherwise be
working in the agriculture industry to
stay at home and that's what and more
importantly delivering the food is the
hard part like
no truck driver wants to drive into a
grocery store during a hurricane for
their own safety
and that is precisely
what happened when it comes to the
pandemic there was just a shortage of
people to deliver the food from the
farms once it was harvested whether it's
due to
concerns of health
related issues or was the fact that
there was a shortage of workers due to
government policy
having people not
working
or
allowing for early retirements
so
that is why you had the
grocery store shortages back then it

[06:00]
grocery store shortages back then it
wasn't due to the running out of food it
was just due to the
distribution of food being hampered by
external circumstances
and speaking of transportation
transportation energy costs are a much
larger
portion of food cost
than you think like if you buy a box of
cereal
the grains itself
the cost of that is well is well under
half of the cost of your food it's
probably under 20 i don't know the exact
numbers
most of the cost is in the packaging and
the shipping
and paying all the salaries of all the
people who work in the food distribution
and food manufacturing company those
costs are not directly affected by the
price of wheat
or the price of corn
so in a developed country
the actual grain component in terms of
food cost
is

[07:00]
is smaller than you'd think same with
with meat it's a little bit higher
actually the percentage of meat costs
because
feed is the most
um
is the most biggest marginal cost
for
meat production so it actually does
impact it that way
and so that's kind of explains
that side of it but the only reason why
i'm also not really that concerned
when it comes to a food shortage in the
long term at least and i'm not really i
think prices can keep going higher
due to a lot of other variables and i'm
not going to go into my commodity price
outlook but
even if things are trading at a higher
price there will still be full shelves
at the grocery store
the supply of food
is stocked for months of inventory in
advance
and
we are at down to in some grains lowest
three and a half to four months of

[08:01]
three and a half to four months of
excess supply
and that is
concerning
but
that doesn't so it means that we're also
nowhere near being out of food and a
grain growing crop cycle is about six
months
so
that could be made up by more grain
being grown in the future and with
prices as high as they are in the
futures market farmers are going to be
heavily incentivized
to grow more even with higher fertilizer
costs
if grain is prices are high enough it's
still
well over the cost of production right
now
to grow grains and like historically
grains trade at the cost of production
because governments subsidize
production
values
well
quantities i mean well over what would
be the equilibrium point and the reason
they do that is for food security
governments have their issues but they
are knowledgeable enough to know that
food shortages are very destabilizing to

[09:00]
food shortages are very destabilizing to
the state
and so that is why most countries in the
world have some sort of farm subsidy
programs to grow well over the needed
amount to keep food prices stable
and to keep food supply available so
that nobody is starving
and with corn
most of corn juice is for ethanol so if
there was really a food shortage in corn
for example
the us government would have already
responded with two things
and several of the world governments
would do similar thing would be one
export controls
if you really are low on something
and
you need to have as much of it as
possible because you're afraid of
running out
a government will respond by simply just
banning the export of it if anything at
grain exports to the us have increased
since the start of the ukrainian
conflict
not
decreased

[10:00]
decreased
the only country really to ban food
exports at this point that i know of and
correct me if i'm wrong in the comments
is hungary
and
most the rest of the world you have not
seen any sort of
banning of food exports i mean russia
too
has restricted it sending it to
western allies and not entirely but
partially ban is more of a
political retaliatory move it's not
because
they're running out of food
and then the other thing too is russia
has a sizable portion of grain exports
but
that's not losing all of russia's grain
production is not coming off the market
a lot of it is used for domestic
consumption first of all
and that's not going to change the
second is similar to what has happened
with iran and oil
iranian oil may be sanctioned in a
technically illegal cell
but there are black market ways that

[11:00]
but there are black market ways that
they get out of the market and there are
buyers who are going to be willing
to buy
that
oil in exchange for a lower price
and so the sanctions still to hurt iran
because they lose money from not being
able to sell their oil on the open
market and have to sell it
an underground means for a lower price
than they would otherwise
and
the oil therefore
gets into the supply anyway even if it's
not in the official numbers i think this
is going to be the same thing with these
grains
sure russia may not sell the grains
directly to
the us's allies but they'll sell it to
china
they'll sell it to india
they'll sell it to other
non-aligned countries in this conflict
and since those countries will be able
to buy the russian grain at a discount
what was previously being sold exports
say from the united states and south
america
that were being sold to those countries

[12:00]
that were being sold to those countries
would be sold in other places to make up
for it
and let's look at the global grain
production as a whole and according to
statista which i will show this chart
in the description i'll link to it and
also probably show it in this video
grain production really between 2008 and
is constant it's about
2.2
a billion
metric tons
of this bin at the highest was 2014 and
15 and we got up to 2.5
billion tons
of grains produced and it came off quite
a bit since then
due to commodity prices just
falling through the floor
and had and therefore
farmers cutting back and not growing as
much
if there is this let's say
for ukraine for example they're
about again 25 wheat and 13

[13:02]
about again 25 wheat and 13
of
corn exports come from russian ukraine
combined
but since
a lot of that is
used domestically
their entire production is not
coming us off the map so let's just stay
for it's probably
much lower than this but the worst case
scenario say
half
of that so you're going to lose say
a total of 10 of the grain market
internationally
and so therefore grain drops from 2.2
trillion metric tons to two
as seen with previous years in the grain
market in 2013
and 2014
you can get grain production back up to
those levels
by the rest of the world making up for
it
uh we can see increased crops in brazil
and you see look at what's going on with
brazil's currency in stock market it's

[14:01]
brazil's currency in stock market it's
done pretty well because they are the
geopolitically safe sort replacement
source for a lot of the commodity
exports previously russia
you can have increased production
obviously in the united states like
kansas has been
tearing down a lot of its wheat fields
and replacing them with growing cotton
but if wheat prices get high enough
they could switch back but cotton is
pretty high too so
maybe not but there are places where
more less
that more expensive to grow crops the
lower margin crops will be swapped out
for higher margin crops because these
grains are trading at higher prices
uh on top and and so there that's where
i think there's plenty of room to catch
up that will lag a little bit
but
we have enough supply that
they're not going in reserve that the
world's not going to run out of food in
less than six months and that's what it
would need to take to have
a global grain shortage

[15:01]
a global grain shortage
there is risk though in some of these
poorer countries the price of food
will rise beyond the level of
affordability
like food spending in western countries
is anywhere from three to ten percent of
income
so if you see a
20 or 30 percent
increase in food
yeah you may not have as much money on
disposable income and that does hurt the
economy but it's not enough that people
are going to like starve
whereas
in
the
emerging world
food is anywhere from 20 to 50
of a monthly budget and many poorer
countries in the world and because of
that
if you have food prices go up 20 or 30
percent that basically eats away your
all of your disposable income and
possibly just your ability to survive

[16:00]
possibly just your ability to survive
from paying for keeping a roof over your
head that's why the arab spring at least
half the reason why things such as the
arab spring took place during the last
big grain spike from say 2010 to 2012.
there's their middle eastern
lower classes were not afforded by food
and therefore they took it out against
the government
but the under rated variable though for
uh revolutions not just food
because yeah the
people could get angry but if you don't
have
the coordinated leadership to
mobilize these people in a way to do
real damage to the state
it's hard for a revolution to succeed
and usually those people who've done
that historically
are the peop the precariat class which
are those who are highly educated but
underemployed
and the arab spring the middle east had
plenty of people like that they had
increased rates of
young people going to college but once
they graduated there weren't that many

[17:01]
they graduated there weren't that many
college-level jobs
and so that created a lot of resentment
and dissatisfaction same thing happened
with russia in 1917 a lot of the
bolsheviks were
recent college graduates but
were not able to find or unwilling to
find
employment that could
that justify
the perceived status boost and they've
claimed to have by going to college
well i'll talk about
the role of
education and
over employment underemployment by
education and what that means her social
political sense maybe in a future video
because it is economic related
but
the thing is that
that is an equal variable to what drives
revolutions as well as a shortage
in grain
but the bottom line really is

[18:01]
twenty ten to twenty percent of corn
production is sold
overseas
fifty percent of wheat and soybeans
are sold
overseas and exports you know so if the
u.s really wanted to
make sure there's plenty of food and
that at the reserve did drop they can
just stop the exports or and there'd be
a glut of food overnight
or just allocate less of it to things
like ethanol and industrial uses and
more towards food
i overall i think that
this whole movement of pitching and end
of the world style
food crisis is
intellectually and borderline morally
irresponsible and i think it's more goal
is to foment political dissatisfaction
for
ideological reasons and to get people
riled up and panic
more than

[19:00]
more than
being actually helpful
let me know your thoughts on this
please like and subscribe
and
don't worry the grocery stores are not
going to run out of food all of a sudden
at least in the united states and most
developed countries there's plenty of
food
it's probably more expensive to go out
to eat in the future
until the grain balances are
normalized the next within the next year
or two
but in the long run
things will be fine when it comes to
food and grain and agriculture exports
are one of the biggest strengths of the
united states as a whole and it's why
america is such a powerful country
because we literally feed the world
it may be a little bit tougher in some
of the more emerging economies where
food is a much bigger portion of
people's budget and we've seen how that
affects places in the last big grain

[20:00]
affects places in the last big grain
spike about a decade ago
but overall
yeah there's plenty of grain in the
world there's plenty of food in the
world even with the disruptions
in ukraine
and
there's no need to panic
