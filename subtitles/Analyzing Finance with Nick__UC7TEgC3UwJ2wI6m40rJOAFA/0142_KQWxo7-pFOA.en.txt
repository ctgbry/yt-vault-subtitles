also known as Geo libertarianism
georgeism is an interesting heterodox
Philosophy from the late 19th century
which I think could actually be
increasingly relevant in the modern
world and I think Henry George is
actually one of the underrated
economists out there
he wrote a book called progress and
poverty which really summarizes his
economic theory and his main concern
really is the distribution of economic
rent
and um how landowners are
disproportionately gaining from the
benefits of economic growth you can see
this example living in a city such as
San Francisco has experienced a lot of
economic growth especially from 2009 to
2020 due to the influx of Web 2.0 and
the related startups the emergence of
big tech companies and the high pay

[01:00]
big tech companies and the high pay
wages however the problem is is that
even though incomes in the San Francisco
Bay Area skyrocketed as a result of all
these high-paying jobs uh rents and
property prices increased a lot more so
the biggest winner from the tech boom in
the Bay Area was not really outside of a
few founders with high concentrated
share positions we're not the workers
building these new technologies but the
land owners
who were renting out or
selling these properties to the new
inflows of people
and Henry George saw this even when he
lived in early 19th century San
Francisco which had its own issues with
land shortage and saw how
disproportionate gains of the city were
really just going to
Elite landowners and as a result

[02:02]
Elite landowners and as a result
his policy worldly solution was to
replace all the existing tax framework
with a single land tax
and the single land tax would be a tax
that would basically tax the economic
gains of just holding raw undeveloped
land
so like say for example if you own a
piece of land in a desirable area and
you're not using it or using it as a
vacation home you're going to pay
um a fairly High tax on that however if
you convert it into something of more
economic use such as like an apartment
building or an office building or
um
a factory or whatever you don't pay any
taxes on the improvements like you do
with a modern property tax you just pay
the equivalent of the society's economic
cost of having it just sit there as

[03:02]
cost of having it just sit there as
vacant unused land or for just personal
consumption
and so what this does is two things
one it mainly Provo becomes a
discourager of land speculation if
people can't make money just sitting on
a property and having it go up because
of um
some policy Trend or people moving to a
certain neighborhood or just sitting and
collecting rents without any
improvements then people are less likely
to do that and invest their Capital
dollars and things that generate returns
or if they do buy properties they'll buy
properties to make Capital Improvements
to improve the productivity of the
region
uh the second benefit of the single tax
is it makes owner occupying more
affordable than it would be otherwise
because you have less bids for land
speculators
and
um
since because there's a relatively High

[04:01]
since because there's a relatively High
property tax it doesn't make sense for
people to own multiple properties
where it's like you instead you you have
the landowners who live there can just
buy a property at a much lower price due
to the tax changing the demand component
of property markets and
in theory this would work fairly well
because you wouldn't need income tax so
sure your property taxes would be higher
than the system let's say if property
taxes
five percent
and you make a hundred and twenty five
thousand dollars a year
which would put you say in the
for this example
I think in like in the 25 tax
bracket actually make the Matthews for a
hundred thousand eight hundred thousand
a year you're in the 20 tax bracket
um and if you live in California you're

[05:00]
um and if you live in California you're
in the 29 tax bracket for this example
but
um
and yet your your property tax
the set of one percent on your 500 000
house would now be three percent or four
percent
so you're paying now instead of 5 000 a
year you're paying twenty thousand
dollars a year but you're not paying any
income tax
so you're still
better off
or at worst
break even
except you're actually a silver Ox
you're not paying property tax but
you're paying the same as you would have
paid
in income tax in this new single tax
and so
that is the idea of George's essentially
is that landowners who effectively get
the most benefit from the state because
that's the reason why their property is
worth more than a than living in a

[06:02]
worth more than a than living in a
government that is more dysfunctional
and they provide the National Defense to
protect your property the police to
reinforce your property rights they
build the roads and the infrastructure
so you people can access your property
and it's livable
and that's a lot that's mostly done by
government so we really shouldn't the
landowners be the ones paying for it
under Georgia Zoom
they would
um
the main real critiques of it is one it
really hasn't been tried out so I have a
few Colonial outputs in Asia in the 19th
century it seemed to have actually a
decent amount of success
in those parts of the world
um the other thing is a lot of people
preferred Marxism because Marxism was
more politically popular because it had
a more of a
retribution and punishing effect on the

[07:00]
retribution and punishing effect on the
quote-unquote rich and people like the
Eat the Rich political rhetoric which
um
low income tax is a far stronger
sale of it the other critique is that
um even if the Georgia's policy was
there it would keep real estate prices
relatively low so people who like to
make their money in real estate would
have a harder time doing it as well as
it would restrict the growth of the size
of the government because
if you have property prices stay
relatively constant
adjusted for inflation
and your tax property tax rate doesn't
change that much over time
then it's very hard to grow revenue and
so your revenue is more capped whereas
you have an income tax
income tax you can raise the tax rates
easier
and on top of that even if you don't you
can
inflate your way out of your debt and

[08:02]
inflate your way out of your debt and
use bracket creep to increase
your revenues so for Paul for
governments income tax is a much more
way to increase Revenue but the thing
also the other benefit of the of the
George system is that it's a lot easier
for tax compliance because you can't
really hide the fact that you own a
property you either own the property or
you don't and if you own the property
you have to pay a fixed tax property tax
is the easiest correct you can't just
take your your land with you across a
border if you decide to move because
taxes are too high
you have to pay tax on the property
whether you live there or not
and or it gets appropriated
um
so yeah there's notable economies such
as Robert solo endorsed I'm surprised
that um
that it really hasn't caught on more I

[09:00]
that it really hasn't caught on more I
think it's a really interesting idea
especially in a world of increased real
estate shortages
could be actually politically appealing
to the right
um
campaign
