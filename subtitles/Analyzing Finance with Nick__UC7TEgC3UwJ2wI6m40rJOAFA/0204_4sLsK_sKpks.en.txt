[00:00]
I'm interested to hear you expand a
little bit more on is when you talked
about the like the Trinity concept Yeah
you mentioned that in in one of your
videos I think that that would be really
interesting to hear a little bit more
the iceberg of Finance this was so I
when I did my semester abroad in Italy
back when I was in college this was
probably the most useful thing I learned
because I never heard of this before and
it's surpris it's talked about in in
professional investment circles a lot
because a lot of people trade on
monetary policy but really outside of
that it's kind of an obscure idea and it
doesn't just apply to markets it applies
to life too in a lot of circumstances
and you have three possible things you
want to do but due to just the con but
you can't form a straight line between
all three points that's why it's a
triangle and so you have to take two and
in the case of Economics The Impossible
Trinity is independent monetary policy
so you could set interest rates at
whatever levels you want or do as much

[01:01]
whatever levels you want or do as much
you can have free movement of capital
which is the ability to move money in
and out of a country without any sort of
barriers and allow your currency to just
to be everywhere and then the third one
is a fixed exchange rate so that like no
matter what you do you're the dollar is
always going to be worth say one Euro
hypothetically in this example you can't
you you only can pick two because if you
because you can ideally you'd want all
three you want want the stability of a
fixed exchange rate system because even
though there are some people who make
money trading Forex the uncertainty of
currency risk and the cost of hedging is
a real burden to Society on the
aggregate you've got the people want the
freedom to have a monetary policy
however they want whether it's to keep
their inflation down or to finance a
more expansionary fiscal policy or
whatever means like governments like the
freedom to be able to do what they want
for that people like the idea of free

[02:01]
for that people like the idea of free
Capital movement because if you have
free Capital
movement foreigners are more likely to
want to invest in your country and more
foreign investment particularly foreign
direct investment is generally a good
thing for economic growth and also it
makes your currency procceed is more
trustworthy so people will denominate
trade in your currency the problem is
that these are fundamentally
incompatible if you want a fixed
exchange rate if you have free movement
of capital people are going to are going
to flee and move out of of your country
move their money out to a more stable
currency so like say for example you
have the government deciding oh we're
going to lower interest rates to zero to
finance a bunch of infrastructure and
therefore the the currency is going to
probably be devalued at least at home if
you're smart like look what's going on
with Japan in the Yen right now they're
printing a bunch of money and they're
not tightening monetary policy enough to
justify they free movement of capital
the yen is free fall in it and they and

[03:01]
the yen is free fall in it and they and
it's going to keep Free Falling until
they tighten their fiscal or monetary
policy worse compared to the dollar in
120 120 years is that right well yeah I
mean I'm just talking about the last two
years I but in the last few years it's
gone from like 125 range to
160 it's there's been a major
devaluation in the end because of this
they have interest rates at near zero
they they finally broke one above zero a
few months ago and the rest of the world
is at four or five% so what are you
going to do you're going to borrow in
Yen or if you have a bunch of Yen you're
going to put it in a bank account
somewhere else collect that 5% but
though those transactions lower the
value of your currency all right as the
capital flight out so if you want
independent monetary policy and a stable
exchange rate you have to lock people in
a a country that does that for example
is China there are certain exemptions
but individuals are for example I'm not
allowed to take more than $50,000 out of
China in a given year there's a lot of
capital controls and that's how they're

[04:00]
capital controls and that's how they're
able to maintain an independent monetary
policy and have a fixed relatively it's
not it's it's it's now based on the SDR
basket versus just the US dollar
directly so that's why it moves a little
bit it's semif fixed but they have a
relatively fixed exchange rate because
they have restricted Capital um controls
and secondly say they for example you
don't you want the fixed exchange rate
and you want free movement of capital
like example this would be Hong Kong you
have to sacrifice having an independent
monetary policy the Hong Kong dollar has
a narrow Peg um to the USD it's like
7.75 to 7.85 HKD to the US dollar the
way they and they have fre you can
freely move money in and out of Hong
Kong and the reason that they can be
able to do that is because they've given
up on Independent monetary policy
basically they interest rate policy and
their levels of liquidity in their
system has to copy the FED because if
they don't then they're going to lose

[05:01]
they don't then they're going to lose
that fixed exchange rate with the dollar
and the currency Peg will break this is
what happened in the Asian financial
crisis in the late 1990s a lot of
countries that had fixed pegs to the
dollar broke this is how George Soros
broke the pound in 1991 because they had
a fixed exchange rate but their monetary
policy wasn't really lined up with that
and so the speculators were able to
break the currency because they couldn't
keep that fixed exchange rate anymore so
you if you want the ex exchange rate and
free movement of capital like in those
cases you have to have a very you have
to copy the monetary policy of whoever
you're pay and then when you dollarize
which is what a country like example
like Panama or Ecuador and Argentina is
trying to do you basically just have the
fed's monetary policy by default because
you're not using your own currency
anymore and so you have the free
movement of the US dollar but you have
no more control and for countries that
have bad fiscal policy history or don't
have a dis of a strong central bank it's

[06:01]
have a dis of a strong central bank it's
probably a better alternative than
having a home Central Bank but there is
a cost and that's you can't have your
own monetary policy and then the third
one is of the Trinity is if you want
fiscal freedom and free movement of
capital then you sacrifice the fixed
exchange rate and that's what most of
the world has like most countries have
independent monetary policies most
countries relatively free movement of
capital the US the EU the EU is fixed
within its within the member states but
I'm talking about internationally the UK
Canada Australia New Zealand and most
International currencies of they they
they have you can move money freely
between them and they have their own
independent central banks that's why
different countries have different
interest rate policies and different
levels of inflation and different fiscal
policies because but the sacrifice
they're making is that their currency
exchange rate changes every day that's
why the Dollar's exchange rate changes
every second on the Forex markets

[07:01]
every second on the Forex markets
because the market is pricing in
differences in these policies there's
other factors that drive effects like
trade flows and supply of Natural
Resources affecting your fiscal and
trade and current account deficits but
just to make things simple the biggest
driver is in monetary policy and
interest rate differentials between
countries and what those are going to
look like in the future and so that's
why currencies move so the like the
reason again it's an impossible Trinity
is you can't have all three you have to
pick two
and as we've seen with the examples I've
mentioned different countries have
picked different two points and you can
apply this to anything else in life it's
just that that where there are three
ideal choices but you have to pick two
but the impossible Trinity is the most
quantifiable and economically useful
example of that that was really
interesting so I really appreciate you
you breaking that down
