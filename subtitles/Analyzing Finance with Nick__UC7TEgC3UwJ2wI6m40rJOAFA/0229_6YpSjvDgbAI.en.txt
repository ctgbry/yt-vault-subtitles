it is not the lack of money that defines
gential poverty but the abundance of
dignity and restraint in how one carries
on Jane Austin so what happens to an old
money family who no longer has the money
to keep up its lifestyle welcome to
analyzing Finance with Nick in this old
money we are going to be discussing
gential poverty which is the idea really
of somebody who has status and titles
and lives a lifestyle or his family
historically lived a lifestyle sorted
with wealth and privilege but no longer
actually has the means to
support themselves it's something I
surprisingly hard to do research on but
it's Al but based on what I found on
this topic gential poverty is a lot more
common in fiction than it is in reality
most notably examples would be like
Shane Austin Books are filled with

[01:02]
Shane Austin Books are filled with
families that are struggling with
gential poverty a lot of soap operas too
and drama of a family Who's down on
their times and they either need to
marry into a wealthy family or have to
adjust to working in the real world and
accept a lower class at least
temporarily because the family fortune
is gone and in real life most of the
examples of gential poverty really
either been the product of two things
the most common one is really unmarried
women who had no access to their
family's inheritance this is example
really would be historically there were
two causes of gential poverty that were
the most common the first one was
unmarried older women who just simply
did not get the family's inheritance
whether it's because they were not the
oldest child

[02:00]
oldest child
or because there were laws that banned
single women from inheriting wealth
either re reason created the same
outcome and a lot of these women were
forced to really either live with
friends and family become teachers or
have some other job that could support
themselves but also had an air of
respectability and that has historically
been the most common the second most
common is really just a product of poor
money management and there's a lot of
creative type people who like work in
the Arts where they're their primary
passion doesn't really generate enough
money to live but they want to spend
like a wealthy person would and this
usually leads to massive amounts of
debts or secretly living in poverty even
though they come off as somebody who's a
very high net worth very top class type
of spender and these people people often

[03:00]
of spender and these people people often
get privately supported by friends or
family who are still in the nobility but
not in Gentile poverty the most famous
historical examples that I could come up
with that fit the second description are
Lord Byron and Oscar wild and eventually
at least for Oscar wild his deaths
eventually did catch up to him then but
that's kind of the reason I'm using a
lot of 19th century examples for this is
because the concept of genal poverty
really has kind of diminished in recent
years and the reasons for that are
multiple first is that the noble
families as a percentage of the
population have shrunk considerably with
the Industrial Revolution and just
globalization and just larger population
growth in developed countries and so as
a result there's simply less of them and
they have less kids and so therefore

[04:00]
they have less kids and so therefore
they are less likely to have issues with
gential poverty also increased women's
rights means that women can inherit
assets and so therefore they are less
likely to face gential poverty also the
old style culture the nobility and the
nobless obl that previously was a thing
in the UK and the United States to a
lesser degree is no longer really there
you've seen a homogeneity of
culture and a lot of negative
stereotypically working class values
have kind of trickled up the uh social
hierarchy and there's really no honor
anymore in living in a way that is
considered classy or gentlemanly or
ladylike or just
sophisticated and the general
democratization and vulgarization of the
culture means that if you do fall into

[05:01]
culture means that if you do fall into
hard times you're likely to adopt a lot
of the negative working class habits at
the same Pace as somebody from lesser
means would and so therefore there
really isn't any gentility to your
poverty you're just plain poor at that
point and so that's kind of why this
really isn't a phenomenon
anymore however there is kind of an
emergence of a modern version of of
gential poverty which is the emergence
of the precariat class the precariat
class are people who have high levels of
Education they have they were raised
usually in Middle upper middle class or
even lower upper class families and
acquired certain mannerisms and
understand a basic way of navigating
amongst like high society and the
establishment but really don't have any
money for them eles and their careers

[06:02]
money for them eles and their careers
don't really earn enough for them to
live a lifestyle associated with their
level of social class and sophistication
the most common professions really for
this would be things such as journalists
post dos and just anybody pursuing the
academic path in general because with
the growth of uh the university system
slowing down really based since the mid
1990s you've had seen very limited
growth in 10e academic positions but
you've seen due to Millennials going to
college at much larger rates than their
predecessors a lot more people applying
for these relatively fixed supply of
college professor jobs and so you're
just creating a class of people who are
the postdoc precariat who are very well
educated and very knowledgeable about
their field and otherwise sophisticated
people but are making barely minimum
wage whether as a postdoc or having to

[07:00]
wage whether as a postdoc or having to
Moonlight at a lower skill type of job
to make ends meet other examples with
this would be people working at
non-profits or NOS journalists as I
mentioned before artistic creative class
or even people with more normal college
educated jobs but due to high levels of
immigration and high housing costs
you've seen wages relatively stagnate
and rents and mortgage a percentage of
income go through the roof so what was
previously perceived as like a stable
comfortable living as say like an
accountant or middle management in a
major for 500 company is now barely
getting by and that's why you started to
see college educated voters shift to the
left it's not really because all of a
sudden these people are going to college
and they've become magically enlightened
in fact if you go as recently as 2012
college educated voters on the net voted
for the Republic

[08:00]
for the Republic
party the thing that has changed is that
more people in the precariat class are
going to college or by going to college
pursuing an academic path they enter the
precariat class and the precariat class
is working class even if they have a
high level of Education you can have a
master's degree and a PhD and still be a
precaria class and the precariat class's
best interests are for a greater social
safety net because they don't have the
same kind of Economic Security that is
an historically associated with being a
college graduate or somebody with a
postgraduate master's degree or PhD and
so that's why you're starting to see the
shift in the political views of those
who went to college because their
economic prospects are very different
than previous generations who went to
college and the housing cost problem is
turning a bunch of people who normally
would be those who have get in the game

[09:00]
would be those who have get in the game
and are invested in the system into
precariat who are maybe one layoff away
from being homeless and I would argue
that the
precariat is the modern gential poverty
and the personification of them and
their politics is really Elizabeth
Warren she kind of is a representation
in her views of the world of the
precarious struggle and what they're
going through and what kind of agenda
would benefit their situation so overall
gential poverty is not really as big of
a thing in the past I mean you do see
some news stories of some of the
nobility in Europe and turning their
houses into museums or tourist
attractions or hotels because the upkeep
is too high but they're still generally
fairly well off even with that the idea
of Gentile poverty has kind of gone away
just due to the changing priorities of
being a sophisticated person and this

[10:02]
being a sophisticated person and this
the overall decline of the nobility in
the public eye and also inherited wealth
being able to be maintained a lot easier
today than in the past however you've
instead of the gential poverty group you
now have a precariat class that has
replaced them and the precariat class is
drastically affecting the politics of
the US and the west and is really the
foundation of who is the base of the
modern democratic party thanks for
