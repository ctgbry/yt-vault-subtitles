order always requires a subtle balance
of restraint force and legitimacy Henry
Kissinger when people think of a map of
America they generally think of an image
like this however what if I told you if
the real reality of America's role in
the globe and the true extent of the
American Empire is more like this
welcome to analyzing Finance with Nick
in today's video we're going to be
talking about the American Empire or the
more formal name of it is the Liber
International order we're going to
discuss what it is what its goals are
and from a perspective of individuals
from for your both your financial life
and your personal life why does it
matter and does the typical American
citizen or Allied country in the liberal
International order benefit from being
part of it the liberal International
order is the United States and Alli
Nations or economically closely

[01:00]
Nations or economically closely
Affiliated Nations that work together to
create the international standards for
trade and human rights there are certain
rules to being involved in the
international order and the other name
for it is the rules based system for
that reason you can tell who's in the
international order based on who follow
these rules and how swiftly they get
punished for deviating from these rules
and some of the key rules of the El AAL
order is relatively free trade having a
free market economy that is open to
International foreign investment and
being part of the security sphere of the
United States and part of the rules that
you're not allowed to forcefully Annex
territory from other Sovereign Nations
so there's a basic respect of individual
sovereignty within the order as a
requirement and also the other
requirement is acknowledgement of
democratic Val vales and what is

[02:02]
democratic Val vales and what is
perceived at least for Western standards
to be basic human rights those who do
not comply with those standards are
dealt with through usually sanctions
economically or military intervention
and sometimes regime change and you
could kind of tell who is in the
international order clearly just based
on if you really thought about it if
this country tried to do an economic or
foreign policy move that deviated from
the United States's interests they would
face severe punishment or they would
face political change until they were
back in line seen in the map here the
liberal International order mainly
consists of the United States and pretty
much all of Mainland North America the
European Union and Switzerland and
Norway a lot of the Middle East
particularly Egypt Israel Jordan Iraq
Saudi Arabia and the Pacific Rim both on

[03:02]
Saudi Arabia and the Pacific Rim both on
the American coast of the Pacific Ocean
going all the way from Alaska down to
Chile and on the Asia austral Asian
Coast with Australia New Zealand most of
the Pacific Islands Indonesia
Philippines Japan and South Korea the
former French colonies in West Africa
that are still closely tied to France
are also connected to the liberal
International order as well as Kenya the
guyan and mo most of the Caribbean the
red are basically countries that are
nonaligned they're not all necessarily
allied with each other but they have
made specific political statements or
Economic Policy decisions that clearly
defy the liberal International order and
have excluded themselves from it to a
certain degree well bricks is the common
name for the biggest players all four of
the bricks countries Plus South Africa
are either explicitly never been part of

[04:00]
are either explicitly never been part of
the Liber Inter National order or are
Breakaway regions as you see like the
Shaded red areas are countries that used
to be part of the Liber National order
but are starting to break away whereas
the countries that are striped shaded
blue are countries that used to be not
part of the international order or
outright opposed it that are in the
process of being integrated into it and
then the purple territories throughout
the map are that are striped are the
disputed regions between between the
liberal International order and a
non-aligned country and if you look at
it from this perspective a lot of
American geopolitics Mak sense somewhere
in Poland or Romania people think the
Western border of America is in the uan
islands in Alaska where it's really just
the Pacific Rim countries in Asia and
knowing that it makes a reason more
sense why does America care about places
like Ukraine

[05:00]
like Ukraine
Taiwan Somalia or the Middle East which
in theory given the fact that America
separated from two oceans they shouldn't
really care about these places at all
but in practice they do because if you
look at America's real power and
influence then their borders are a lot
closer to the geopolitical fault lines
than commonly perceived and yeah the
reason makes the liberal International
order different from other Empires is
that there's a lot more domestic Freedom
America does not try to force its
religion on people America does not try
to formally Annex territory America
doesn't even try to force people to
learn its language however many members
of the international particularly the
upper classes voluntarily learn English
so they can participate America
international Ambitions is more of a
subsidy to help grow the rest of the
world's economy in order to ensure peace
and stability more than an extractive
relationship historically most Empires

[06:02]
relationship historically most Empires
gain from extracting from their colonies
or Annex provinces where the US's model
was mainly built more on building up its
allies and building up the conquered
territories and to make them as
economically strong and viable as
possible so they could benefit the US
via trade or through being buyers of its
Bonds on the in terms of the treasury
market and also being strong buffers
against the non-aligned count countes
and the reason why the US had to be much
more carrot than stick was due to the
Cold War when you had the Soviet Union
offering a bunch of support for
non-aligned countries as well to be part
of its International order which was
known as the Warsaw Pact the US had to
offer a better deal and the deal
essentially that they offered is look
we'll guarantee you National Defense
we'll guarantee you stability and we
will allow you to have massive economic
growth through free trade and foreign
direct investment in your countries and

[07:01]
direct investment in your countries and
in exchange you participate in our
International order and you follow basic
rules to how to conduct your economy and
for some countries they have to parti
have the ones that are more entrenched
in the liberal National order and they
more have a more provincial type
relationship with the Metropol of the
United States they have to adopt other
requirements such as being a democracy
or having certain socially Progressive
views on human rights in fact really you
can tell the more captured the country
is is the ones that have the more
socially Progressive views that America
exports so that's kind of the example of
how this all works and you know how you
can tell that a country is in the
liberal National orders because if they
try to do anything that breaks from the
US's foreign policy goals or the US's
Economic Policy goals then they get
dealt with like you're not going to see

[08:00]
dealt with like you're not going to see
for example Spain decide to become a
communist country and nationalize all of
its foreign particularly American held
assets they will be that government will
be taken care of quickly or say example
Italy decides to side with Russia on the
Ukraine war like that the fact that they
don't have that optionality you know
that they're part of liberal
International order or where or just for
example say if Ireland wanted to or or
Chile wanted to just boycot
All American goods and embargo trade
embargo that would just not be put up
with and we saw with happen being thrown
out in Chile what happens when you cross
the liberal International order but the
US has through cultural softing has done
such a great job in papering over the
hard power that keeps the order together
that makes it seem like a lot more
voluntary than you think it is it's not
a coincidence that most International
opinion on geopolitical issues lines up

[09:00]
opinion on geopolitical issues lines up
with the standard American Think Tank
view of the world that's not a
coincidence it's it's a byproduct of the
soft and hard power that kind of
dictates the liberal International order
so now that we have this understood that
basically countries get increased
economic Prosperity through trade and
foreign direct investment and defense in
exchange of aligning with us economic
and foreign policy interests what are
the costs and the benefits for Americans
and for Allied Nations to be part of the
liberal International order because the
question I always thought about when
analyzing American foreign policy
particularly interventionist foreign
policy is like why are we wasting all
these money on war overseas how is it
that myself as an average American
benefit from this like I could see how
maybe certain political factions in the
places that are under conflict benefit
from it and defense contractors and the
jobs created for people working at them

[10:00]
jobs created for people working at them
like I could see those benefits but that
but apart from the military-industrial
complex it seems like it's a raw deal
for the average American citizen and
even some of the Allied country citizens
to be part of this liberal International
order it's not that straightforward
there actually are a lot of benefits and
the irony is the people who benefit the
most from the liberal International
order are often it's harshest critics
first the main beneficiary of the
liberal International order is economic
Prosperity like the post World War II
era to 2000 was the greatest growth
period in the history of global
economics and that lot of it was driven
due to free trade pushed by the liberal
International order you had living
standards across the Alli Nations
accelerate you've seen poverty rates
collapse all over the world hunger's
gone down you've seen health and
lifespan have basically climbed a lot
Bas from 40 1945 to 2000 and the

[11:02]
Bas from 40 1945 to 2000 and the
consumer Society really evolved that
people just were living much more
comfortable lives also the level of
violence especially on a per capita
basis has gone down materially since
then and there's a lot more geopolitical
stability like you really other part
from the breakup of the Soviet Union you
really didn't see any major territorial
changes during the post World War II
period and really the problem with
what's going on with Ukraine conflict
and Russia desire to Annex regions is
they're breaking the fundamental law
that the Lial International order has
meant to impose which is no involuntary
exchanges of territories from Sovereign
Nations and that's why this is perceived
as such a threat because you can't let
that precedent set if we go back to the
pre-World War II days of countries
taking territory from each other that's
very destabilizing and a threat to the
current order of things so that's

[12:01]
current order of things so that's
probably the biggest benefit has been
just increased economic Prosperity than
you would have had otherwise but my
critics say oh that's just conjecture
how do you know that the economy would
have been better off with the liberal
National order the US was doing just
fine and it was on a great trajectory
before the second world war so why
couldn't that continue so there are
other benefits too you have more
security and peace less Wars we've
talked about that as well and you've
seen a lot of countries have more
Democrat governments that previously
ruled under more authoritarian regimes
again that might be just a western
imposed value of what is a good thing
but those are some of the more obvious
perks but again none of those really go
down to the question as an average
person yeah on a collective aggregate
you may see some benefits but as your
average person who works a corporate job
in the United States of America what
have you seen as a benefit from the
liberal International order apart from
esoteric numberg go up GD data well
there's a few things first the fact that

[13:02]
there's a few things first the fact that
the US sphere of influence and effective
Empire is as extensive as it is means
you have a lot more economic and
cultural exchange and one of the
benefits of that is travel has become a
lot more affordable in the pre- liberal
National War World it was a lot more
harder to get visas and be allowed to
visit other countries now most of the
world for holders of American and
European passports is accessible without
a Visa if you go to a country within the
Li Lial International order you can be
fairly confident that you can go there
and you will be safe especially if you
stay out of the criminal underground
activities that are in some of the more
dangerous parts of the of of the world
yeah that kind of safety traveling is
taken for granted the safety of trade
too for ship large container ships to
cross the world unmolested is not
something that was been taken to granted
in history you had most history had to
deal with piracy deal with banditry you
had to deal with a lot more crime in

[14:01]
had to deal with a lot more crime in
terms of going after tourists and the
opportunities to say visit other
countries as a tourist to live in other
countries as an expatriate or an
immigrant to a new place the opportunity
to say have semester abroad or go to
school internationally that wouldn't
really be as prevalent or may not even
be available at all if it wasn't for the
influence of the liberal International
order the other benefit is just the
proliferation of the English language if
you're an American you don't have to
learn other languages like people in
other countries do and the reason for
that is because the need for English to
be the linga franka of international
trade and as because of the influence of
America overseas other people in much
smaller countries have to be fluent in
multiple languages including English to
be a functioning member of society but
with English being the standard language
of the internet being the standard
language of Aviation being the standard
language of Finance and being the
standard language of a lot of other

[15:02]
standard language of a lot of other
Industries and of international foreign
policy you have effectively the the need
to not have to learn other languages and
a much easier life than you would
otherwise just on that alone the other
beneficiary of the international order
is the strength of the US dollar the
consequence of liberal naal ERS the US
dollar is the reserve currency and
because foreign countries need US dollar
foreign exchange reserves the US can
print a lot more money without inflation
than another country whose money in
circulation is really only circulate
locally and so it allows the US
government partially they use that to
finance in keeping together the liberal
National order but also allows deficit
spending to continue a lot longer than
it would otherwise and so the US has
relatively low tax burden compared to
the level of Social Services it promises
and also has
lower tax burden especially factoring

[16:01]
lower tax burden especially factoring
the cost of National Defense like Europe
has a higher tax burden and higher
Social spending but they don't have to
pay for defense it's heavily subsidized
and that's the main benefit Europeans
get they get their generous welfare
state that's generally a derivative of
the liberal International order if it
wasn't for the defense guarantees that
they get from the United States they
would have to finance much larger
militaries and as a result they would
have not been able to provide the
generous social safety n that they do in
their countries it's a direct byproduct
of the American Empire other benefits is
you have it's just easier to connect
with people socially you have a dominant
Mass Global culture so you're more
likely to have friends or even family
members who live in other parts of the
world if you're somebody today who lives
in one of these countries and has a
spouse or relatives who are from a
different part of that country if it
wasn't for the international order
there's a chance your family may not

[17:00]
there's a chance your family may not
even exist today that will increase the
amount of connection also you probably
have an increase in Innovation because
you have more collaboration between
researchers scientists and academics
throughout the liberal International
order than you would if they were all
competing against each other so that
allows for increased technological
advancement that would have been faster
than possibly if everybody was more
Alaric so and then for business business
owners who are the biggest beneficiary
you look our class structure I talked
about the American class structure the
main winners of the liberal
International order are the business
owning classes and the establishment
Elites and to a lesser degree the ivy
league and profession institutional
professional classes because the markets
for themselves or their employers are
much bigger instead of having only your
home country as a market to sell to you
now have basically every country in the
liberal International as a market and
therefore you the international growth

[18:00]
therefore you the international growth
potential allows you to compete globally
and therefore have a much bigger upside
to business that's why you see much
larger globally powerful companies today
because just the market size potential
is that much bigger and you can have
Global Supply chains that lower cost of
doing business and you can have free
movement of capital which means you have
more access to Investments and for those
in America since most of the liberal
International order has reverse home
bias and in terms of their stock
selections American stocks have much
higher valuations than they would
otherwise relative to the rest of the
world because it as the financial center
of the Empire people trust having their
money there versus in their home
countries or some other country and so
foreign Capital comes into America in
both its stock market and its real
estate market and also its bond market
and so the US government probably has
lower interest rates than it would
otherwise consumers overall probably
have lower interest rates than they
would otherwise if it wasn't for foreign

[19:01]
would otherwise if it wasn't for foreign
Capital flows Inward and housing price
valuations and stock price valuations
would be much lower if it wasn't for the
role of the US foreign policy and so
those are the benefits like the main
beneficiary is the international
businessman or woman who travels a lot
they are the big winner and they
American one wins
disproportionately but business
international business people in any of
the alied countries are big Winners also
just the Cosmopolitan class in general
people who've done semester AB Brads
who've lived overseas or travel a lot
for leisure and they also tend to be big
Winners and it's funny because a lot of
these people tend to also have more
left-wing political views that are
anti-American imperialism yet their
whole existence and their lifestyle is
dependent on the maint maintenance of
American imperialism so those are the
winners the main Losers of the

[20:00]
winners the main Losers of the
interational order are more the working
class in aligned us and aligned
countries particularly those who are
working in manufacturing as I've showed
you guys before there's the whole idea
of the elephant curve of globalization
as whereas the very bottom people moved
up because of it and the very top people
moved up because of it because of the
Superstar effect but those in the upper
middle tier globally were big losers
because they now have cheaper
International competition for labor or
they could be disrupted by technology on
the other side of the world and or their
cost of living is bit up by Foreign
investment buying real estate or have or
businesses who could be successful
competing just in their home Market but
they can't compete when a multinational
corporation enters and competes with
them directly so those are The Losers of
the liberal International order and the
losers are the people who in theory
often are the most pro-military their

[21:01]
often are the most pro-military their
military is enforcing an order that is
against their economic interests to a
certain degree the people in
manufacturing whove been disrupted or
those who are the more rural communities
probably disproportionately benefit from
an unwind of the liberal National order
even though I think on the net most
people would lose but the cost benefit
for the people on The Losers of the
elephant curve often would be different
than the more Cosmopolitan classes or
the global poor the other main downside
is just the national debt implications
and the expense the US does not make
money through the liberal International
order they have to subsidize basically
the defense of all the aligned Nations
and which are basically as you see on
the map in all corners of the globe and
now as I mentioned in my video with
reacting to Neil Ferguson's PE Soviet
America we are at a juncture where
interest on the national debt for the
first time exceeded defense spending

[22:02]
first time exceeded defense spending
usually when that happens the the great
power who's facing that dilemma usually
has to roll back on their defense as
some form of fiscal austerity and so the
US might be just threatening its own
long-term fiscal Health by subsidizing
everybody else's defense and the example
of this shifting is really what you've
seen with President Trump's policies in
regards to Nato making the these
countries quote unquote pair their fair
share is a way that you can try to
maintain the liberal International order
without being so dependent on us defense
spending to hold it all together because
if the fiscal imbalances in the US as
they are currently continue to worsen
they're the US will not be able to
finance keeping the liberal
International order together and if
everybody involved thinks it's a net
benefit then what they need to do is
probably cooperate more in helping
footing the bill of defending it so
that's kind of another real cost and

[23:02]
that's kind of another real cost and
that cost is paid for through inflation
and increased taxes and also the lives
lost from US soldiers being involved in
Foreign Wars such as Vietnam and Iraq
Wars one and two on top of that though
the one caveat is with the evolution of
drone technology and other unmanned
combat the human life cost for
maintaining the inter liberal
International order could drop
exponentially here and with the
demographic pyramids inverting it's
going to be necessary to have a lower
human cost to maintain the Empire if it
is to be maintained the other real
downside for it is negative public
opinion from non-aligned countries and
increased resentment of non-aligned
countries leading to possible conflicts
in the future if the non-aligned
countries gain relative strength to the
liberal International order that's the
other downside but the main downside
really for the average person is higher

[24:01]
really for the average person is higher
taxes and higher inflation to finance
the liberal National order and the US
need to be involved militarily in places
so those in the military having to risk
their lives is the other downside so now
with clear of like what the upside and
the downside is what is the future of
the liberal International order a lot of
people think this is due to fall apart I
don't think that's necessarily the case
I think it'll have to be reincorporated
though but in a way that is more
inclusive and honestly really the best
way for world peace is if you can get
most countries even the non-aligned
countries to fully invest in the basics
of the liberal International order the
problem is is that a lot of the US and
the European countries who've been the
most aligned with the current order have
been kind of complacent and of the point
they are trying to export values that
may not be considered universal and
importing them into what was the goals

[25:01]
importing them into what was the goals
of the liberal International order like
there's a lot of socially Progressive
values that are not popular in say
Russia or China or the Middle East or in
subsaharan Africa that makes it
difficult for these countries to want to
incorporate because they're afraid of
their cultures getting quote unquote
degraded by Western degeneracy there's
also the issue of authoritarian
governments being unwilling to sign up
for the Democracy part that is usually a
requirement there are some notable
exceptions to that but that's usually a
requirement to be part of the liberal
International order and countries who
have increasingly become more
authoritarian or who want a bigger share
of the pie than they would get in the
liberal International order are starting
to break away and you see like the
countries that are kind of in the red
crosses areas like such as India Central
Asia Turkey and South Africa most
notably at one time were part of the
liberal International order but are in

[26:00]
liberal International order but are in
the process or have already completed
the process of breaking away doesn't
mean they're necessarily aligned with
all the other countries who are not
aligned but they realize wait I don't
want to be part of this this Empire
unless if I get a bigger piece of the
pie that's more proportionate to my
contributions and a lot of these
countries feel like that the original
countries in the liberal National order
which would be the United States Canada
Australia New Zealand Japan and Western
Europe disproportionately benefit from
this arrangement from both an economic
perspective and a political and Status
perspective because the other downside
if you're a non-american for the liberal
International is you don't get really a
say in your economic and foreign policy
yeah us is not going to try to force you
to become an Evangelical Christian or
wear the rainbow flag depending on what
side of the aisle the current
Administration is on they're not going
to to mess with your local customs and

[27:00]
to to mess with your local customs and
even an economic policy they'll let you
have your social safety as long as you
keep International Financial system free
flowing and free trade and all this
inter policy that matters to America
untouched however if you want to deviate
in any of these bigger things you can't
you have really no say and you have no
vote in it because you because
foreigners cannot vote in American
elections and so there is some
sovereignty giving up that's why I call
this an Empire even though nobody
involved would like to call it an Empire
and the Empire benefits most of the
participants economically which makes it
a little bit different than previous
ones however there is some cost and that
cost is you have less freedom and
depending on how closely knitted you are
it restricts your freedom that much more
however if it was such a bad deal you
wouldn't really have countries trying to
be a part of it like you've had after
end of the Cold War most of Central and
Eastern Europe joined in Argentina is in
the process of trying to get acclimated
to the liberal National order and you

[28:02]
to the liberal National order and you
have other countries in the world who
are trying to get more aligned even ones
who are previously bitter enemy such as
Vietnam so it's not all bad but that's
the main downside so how do you convince
these people to have a pay a greater
share of their defense budget and being
able to cooperate more if they do not
really have a say and also if they the
the other thing too is that how do you
the liberal International orders goals
often are against the interests of the
voters in the in America or perceived to
be like populism is threatening The
public's opinion of the liberal
International order overall the Lial
National order and the American Empire
is basically how things really operate a
lot of countries you think that don't
really cooperate are really working
closely together to keep this preserved
it has allowed record levels of economic
growth international trade international

[29:02]
growth international trade international
cultural exchange adoption of the
English language and a lack of violence
on a per capita basis and Wars within
its borders and even really impacting
the countries that decide not to
participate however as some of the
non-aligned countries and the Breakaway
countries continue to have their
economies grow faster than the core
liberal International order and
demographic imbalances changed the
sustainability of the liberal National
order is being put to the test and it
will be interesting to see if it
survives I know this is kind of a long-
winded video I go into a lot of facts if
you want to read more about these topics
for suggested books I recommend world
order by Henry kisinger and I recommend
confessions of an economic Hitman by
John Perkins they're probably the two
best places to start to see how the
world order is put together and how
those who deviate from it
get punished so if that's kind of your

[30:01]
get punished so if that's kind of your
good primers to intro to feel like if
you want more of the facts and the Deep
dive kind of analysis on how all this
stuff works in practice where I kind of
have to you're a higher level and
explain how it operates in theory and
how it benefits people citizens and if
you're watching this and you are a
citizen of a country in the liberal
International order do you feel like
being part of it has been a net benefit
to you or as the finan
and cultural costs of being part of it
been a net negative I'd like to hear why
because this is something that I'm
trying to figure out really as an
American myself who probably is in the
social classes who have benefited the
most not necessarily in terms of wealth
but in terms of the fact of my ability
to have been involved with the
International Community in various
stages of my life whether as a tourist
or through business or through my
education I'm probably somebody who has
directly benefited from the liberal
International order but I'd like to hear

[31:01]
International order but I'd like to hear
from people who feel like they've
benefited in different ways or have been
a loser from this this is I this could
be a great start to another series kind
of like what we've done with old money
and I would love to hear your thoughts
and thank you all for watching
