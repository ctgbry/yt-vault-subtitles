okay you can try to cancel me for saying
this but I truly don't care if you are
between the ages of 20 and 40 and you
want to optimize your life for wealth
creation do not get a remote job and do
not start a remote company here's why if
you're an employee who do you think is
going to get that promotion who's going
to get the raise the person that's
interfacing face to face with their
Superior or the person that's sitting at
home now as a business owner would I
rather compete with a company that has
all remote employees or all on-site
employees all remote easy because they
are not in sync they are not fully
productive and they're not going to win
now you might be optimizing for
lifestyle quality of life and you can
still build wealth that way if so stay
home I work from home I'm home right now
it's awesome my employees work from home
I'm not trying to optimize to be the
biggest best baddest company in the
world I'm optimizing for lifestyle and I
can still build we that way yes it's
hard to drive to work it's hard to get
in the car it sucks traffic sucks you
know what else sucks running lifting
weights having hard conversations eating
your vegetables usually the harder way
is the better way follow me for business
