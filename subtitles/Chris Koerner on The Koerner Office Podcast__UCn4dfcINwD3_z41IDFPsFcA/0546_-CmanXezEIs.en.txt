look at this freaking thing right here
every time you see a video that features
the newest dumb product out of China
instead of rolling your eyes and
scrolling on by I want you to think how
can I make this a business because any
genius product idea could be a genius
business idea here's my favorite
business idea around this dumb product
look at all these businesses right here
that make millions of dollars by playing
middleman between car owners and
companies that want to advertise you can
put a sign on your car you can wrap your
car you got taxis that do it in Vegas or
in the backs of Ubers or lifts there's
an entire industry built up around
matching car owners with advertisers so
that one's not my idea but take that
framework and pair it with this freaking
product that cannot cost that much what
do you do you go find advertisers they
want to put their logo product sales
pitch halta action QR code or whatever
on this display that's going to be the
harder part and then the easier part is
finding car owners that are willing to
put these on the sides of their cars to
show ads to help offset their car
payment 50 bucks a month 500 bucks a
month somewhere in there they get paid
for doing nothing for just driving
around the more miles you put on your
car the more money you can make because
ads are sold on a CPM basis cost per
Mill AKA how many eyeballs see that ad
how do you make money you take a
percentage cut between what the

percentage cut between what the
advertiser pays and what the car owner
receives get the full business plan
