[00:00]
It's a perfect side hustle business. You
don't have to quit your job and go
full-time. You can start doing a couple
of these a month, get the experience,
and make some real money.
&gt;&gt; He is doing seven figures a year
inspecting roofs.
&gt;&gt; What?
&gt;&gt; That's right. These are drones you can
buy on Amazon. Every time there's a
storm, he makes 15 to $30,000 in
inspections.
&gt;&gt; Oh my gosh. He just knocks them out. He
takes 50 to 60 photos. He spends 15
minutes per inspection. It's about a $23
billion market. It's projected over the
next 10 years to grow at an annual
growth rate of 15% a year. It's gonna
10x over the next 10 years.
&gt;&gt; Nick, do you know my uncle Clark?
&gt;&gt; Absolutely. Is he the guy that lives in
Indiana, Michigan?
&gt;&gt; No. Utah. And as my grandma would say,
he's a character. Clark's a character.
Love you, Clark. So Clark is a hustler
and he lost his job as an engineer few
decades ago. He had 40 grand to his
name. He turned it into this rental
house empire. But as he was building
these rental houses, literally by hand,
he built these homes by himself,

[01:00]
he built these homes by himself,
&gt;&gt; he had to like Yeah. He had to like pay
the bills and he did so in a very
creative way. He is like a huge airplane
enthusiast, model airplane enthusiast.
&gt;&gt; And so he had this hobby room and he
would build these model airplanes,
attach cameras to them, and this was
like in the 90s, I think 80s or 90s. and
he would fly them over farmland in
northern Utah, Cache Valley, and take
beautiful pictures of like properties,
ranches, acorage, right? And then he'd
go get them. He'd develop them himself.
He had a dark room and he would get like
these like 2x3 foot gorgeous
highresolution images of this farmland
and he'd go to the farmer's front door,
knock on it, and say, "Hey, look at this
picture I took of your property. Wow,
that's gorgeous. Thank you so Yeah, it's
$250. It cost him like almost nothing to
get it developed because he was doing it
himself. And he had like a 60 70% take
rate. And why wouldn't he really?
&gt;&gt; Where else? Yeah. Where else are they

[02:00]
&gt;&gt; Where else? Yeah. Where else are they
going to get that image? And they have
pride of ownership. Like that's my farm.
That hm I would love to hang that in my
living room, you know? Isn't that smart,
&gt;&gt; dude? That's freaking genius. He's a
hustler. Is that what that's where
hustle comes from?
&gt;&gt; That's it. Came from my uncles. It's
funny you brought that up because you
and I have been deep diving going back
and forth. I think this might be the
coolest business I've seen in the last
year and it's not AI. It takes advantage
of all the things that we always talk
about. What are the things that we love
when we're looking at businesses,
especially for first- time
entrepreneurs? Macro trends like this a
market that's just going up and to the
right, right? We want it to look like
the Bitcoin chart circus 2019 into 2020,
right? We want it up and to the right.
Beyond that, what else do we want? We
want stuff that's like not super
operationally complex. We want things
that
&gt;&gt; easy to start, affordable to start. We
want stuff that's freaking cool. It's
just cool. It just has a cool factor.
Hole-in-one challenge. That's cool,
right? Sandbox RC cars in a coffee shop.
That's freaking rad, right? That's what

[03:00]
That's freaking rad, right? That's what
we want.
&gt;&gt; Okay, so I think I stumbled upon I think
we have stumbled upon the coolest unsexy
market that nobody is talking about. Do
you know what it is?
&gt;&gt; It's kind of sexy, though. I I just want
to say it's a little sexy.
It's like a eight out of 10. Sexy.
&gt;&gt; I'm talking about drone roof
inspections. I'm going to be honest.
I've said that to myself three times in
a row and I'm like, "What? What? Drone
drone roof inspections."
&gt;&gt; A DRI. I call it a DRI. I'm a DI
&gt;&gt; DRI. Oh, you're a DRRi guy. I'm a DIY
DRI guy.
&gt;&gt; You're a dry guy. That's cool. You're a
dry guy. I'm a dry guy. Yeah,
&gt;&gt; dude. Check this out. That like these
stats blew my mind. Right now, there is
a market. There's a currently a market
for basically inspection and monitoring.
It's about a $23 billion market. Within
that market though, only $350 million
are currently of drone rooftop
inspections. However, it's projected
over the next 10 years to grow at an
annual growth rate of 15% a year, 14.5%
a year to three half billion dollars by
2035. So, it's going to 10x. It's going
to 10x over the next 10 years growing at

[04:03]
to 10x over the next 10 years growing at
would love this,
&gt;&gt; dude. Take that number, bro, and
freaking 10x that. And then 10x it
again. So within 10 years it's going to
10x. You know what I hear when I hear
that? Ch-ching cha-ching. I hear the the
cash registers.
&gt;&gt; Well, let's just give some context about
Kagger compound annual growth rate on
entire industries. Like 3% is solid. 5%
is good. 15% is nuts.
&gt;&gt; Here's why it matters. If you're just
looking at the general growth rate of
the United States, inflation, right? Oh,
with inflation, what's GDP growth?
Typically, like a good GDP growth is
like 3%. We're stoked if we're at 3%. So
if the rest of the country is growing at
3% and the business that you choose is
growing at 15%. I'm no mathematician,
but it's growing at five times the rate
of the rest of the country. Like that's
why it matters. Everybody else is kind
of just chugging along. They're kind of
raising their prices a little bit, but
yours is like a freaking rocket ship.
There's so much demand behind it. It's
5x what the rest of the country is
growing at. It's nuts.
&gt;&gt; Sorry, I'm smiling because I just

[05:00]
&gt;&gt; Sorry, I'm smiling because I just
realized how much I love excitedly
talking about industries and not selling
a course at the end of it. Because I bet
you half of the people listening right
now are like, "Oh, let me guess. This is
the best industry ever. And for $7,000
measly dollars, you'll show me how to
launch in this industry, right?"
&gt;&gt; No, bro.
&gt;&gt; There's none of that.
&gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. For five easy payments
of of $79.99, we only have room for four
more people, guys. Come on.
&gt;&gt; Uh, no. Thankfully, we're not selling a
course. Although, we should sell a
course because this is like this is a
courseable business.
&gt;&gt; It's very courseable.
&gt;&gt; It's a very
&gt;&gt; courseable. It is.
Anyways, that's the highle overview of
what this market in this industry is.
But the question is,
&gt;&gt; what even is drone roof inspections?
&gt;&gt; Are you laying me up right here,
&gt;&gt; dude? I'm like softball. I'm waiting for
Barry Bonds to freaking just hit it out
of the park.
&gt;&gt; Okay. All right. Drone roof inspections.
40% of the market is for insurance
companies, right? Can I give you a stat
about insurance companies? It's going to
blow your mind.
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

[06:00]
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.
&gt;&gt; There is a crisis in the insurance
industry. We are projecting the industry
is projecting 400,000 vacancies in the
insurance industry like for adjusters,
claims adjusters, inspectors. By the
year 2038, we will have 400,000 unfilled
positions. Right? Because 50% Nick, when
is the last time you talked to a 27y old
that's like, I'm just fired up to join
the insurance industry. I've always
wanted to be an adjuster or an actuary.
Right.
I don't want to be an estimator. I want
to be an adjuster.
&gt;&gt; Estimator. Hardly know her.
&gt;&gt; Actually, that's not what they do. So,
50% of the insurance workforce is
retiring in the next 15 years.
&gt;&gt; Holy crap, man. That's a ton.
&gt;&gt; Less than 25% of the current workforce
is under age 35. They're boomers.
&gt;&gt; Oh my gosh. Say that stat one more time.
What percentage is under the age 35?

[07:00]
What percentage is under the age 35?
Less than 25% of the current workforce
is under 35.
&gt;&gt; Oh my. That's why it's so irritating to
talk to an adjuster cuz they're all
boomers.
&gt;&gt; Worse.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, okay.
&gt;&gt; We have some We have some boomer
listeners, Nick. We love
&gt;&gt; They get They get it.
&gt;&gt; They know.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; So, that creates an opportunity. That
creates a title wave for more efficient
ways of of climbing on roofs,
&gt;&gt; dude. And then you couple that with the
fact that we have a an aging
infrastructure. Yeah,
&gt;&gt; our homes are getting older and not just
our homes, the commercial properties,
the schools, the infrastructure that we
have is getting older and older. We have
less and less of the people who can
actually do the inspections. H is that
an opportunity for technology to step
in?
&gt;&gt; H I don't know.
&gt;&gt; I say that'll do it.
&gt;&gt; I mean, just picture a 63y old
&gt;&gt; insurance adjuster rolling up to a house
with a huge ladder, steep pitch on the
roof, and he's like, "What? What am I
doing? I'm not doing that. I'm not doing
it."
&gt;&gt; Like, are you kidding? Like most
dangerous thing you can do is inspect a

[08:01]
dangerous thing you can do is inspect a
roof.
&gt;&gt; Not only that, think about the insurance
companies or the property management
companies or the commercial companies
who are like, I'm going to send this
adjuster out. I'm going to have them
climb up on a roof. That's a workers
comp claim waiting to happen. That's a
lawsuit waiting to happen. It's not it's
not worth the risk.
&gt;&gt; Sounds like you're teeing me up for a
stat about workers comp in the roofing
industry.
&gt;&gt; Am I ready?
&gt;&gt; Is there a stat about that? Hm.
&gt;&gt; 25%
of every payroll dollar in a roofing
business goes to workers comp insurance.
25%.
&gt;&gt; Shut your mouth. Shut your mouth.
&gt;&gt; Swear in my life. Swear in my life.
&gt;&gt; That's insane. 25 cents of every dollar
payroll dollar
&gt;&gt; spent on payroll goes to workers comp
insurance in roofing.
&gt;&gt; Like for context, if if you don't know
that, typically anywhere between like 17
and 21%
goes to non-compensation.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Like payroll taxes.
&gt;&gt; Payroll taxes. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Social Security, Medicare, benefits,
etc. Right.
&gt;&gt; And that's usually inclusive of of
workers comp. You're saying just workers
comp is 25% in the roofing industry.

[09:01]
comp is 25% in the roofing industry.
That's insane.
&gt;&gt; Real quick, please subscribe to my
channel. I know it's kind of lame to
ask, but it means a lot. Thanks.
&gt;&gt; Here's what's crazy about that. Or
here's why I like that, I should say.
Again, we're talking about an aging
infrastructure. We're talking about an
aging industry that's having people
retire. So, there's a need both on the
demand and the supply side, right?
supply is going down as demand is going
up for this stuff. And then at the at
the same time, it's regulated. Like they
are required, many of these property
management companies, school districts,
anybody who's doing new construction,
they're required to conduct these
surveys. OSHA requires them to make sure
that they're within compliance. Like
this isn't something that is an optional
thing. They have to do it. So you couple
all of those things. The fact that it's
mandatory from a regulatory and
compliance standpoint, the fact that
we're getting less supply and more
demand, it's like and then that's why
it's going to grow 15% a year is because
now we have to have technology step in
to actually fix the problem.
&gt;&gt; Not just that, but average gross profit
margins on a job, and we'll get into

[10:00]
margins on a job, and we'll get into
what the job is specifically, but
average gross margins are 50 to 70%. Net
profit margins 20 to 30%. and like
high-end if you're really efficient 40
to 50% net profit margin in this
business.
&gt;&gt; What was your research on the average
ticket price? So like if I'm if I'm
going out and I'm doing an inspection,
how much does it cost on average?
&gt;&gt; So it depends on what you're inspecting
and like the industry. But for like a
standard visual residential home, 2 to
400 bucks. If you need thermal imaging
on that, you're going to add1 to $3300
extra dollars to that. Commercial,
you're looking at $300 to $700 per job.
something like a a high-rise, something
more complex like industrial, you're
looking at $500 to $1,500 per job. They
also go by square foot, like 15 to50
cents per square foot. And then if you
want to do like 3D mapping with more
expensive drones or AI powered damage
analysis, you're looking at like $4 to
$700, something like that.
&gt;&gt; You look at those, it's not a crazy high

[11:01]
&gt;&gt; You look at those, it's not a crazy high
sort of, I guess, revenue job,
&gt;&gt; right? However, the margins are so good
on it because other than the initial
investment up front, which we'll talk
about, it's pretty much your time when
you're going out to do these jobs. It's
pretty much your time. And so, if you
can be really efficient, you're going to
have really high net margins.
&gt;&gt; Yep. What does it take to get into this
business, Nick?
&gt;&gt; This part was really cool as I was doing
the research. So, first of all, I like
businesses that have at least some sort
of a moat.
&gt;&gt; Explain what a mode is.
&gt;&gt; So, a moat is anything that makes it
difficult for somebody to enter into
that industry. There's a barrier to
entry for a business like this. You
can't just show up at somebody's house
and be like, "I've got a drone. I'm
going to go ahead and fly it and I'm
going to do
&gt;&gt; You can just not legally inspect
a lot of the companies that use drone
inspections like roofing companies might
have somebody on staff who will do their
own inspections, but really they
shouldn't be doing that. So, the first
thing you need is you actually do need a
license. It's an FAA regulated license.
I believe it's called a I'm saying 7A.

[12:01]
I believe it's called a I'm saying 7A.
&gt;&gt; FAA part 107.
&gt;&gt; Thank you. So FAA part 107. It's an
actual license. It takes like 20 to 40
hours to actually go and do it. It's a
test that you have to pass. It's
something that you actually have to do
in order to operate these drones. The
second thing is there's actually prep
work in order to go up and fly a drone.
So you need to see whether or not you're
in FAA regulated airspace. And if you
are, you have to actually submit for
approval. And then in order to get the
approval, sometimes it takes up to 30
days. So there is some complexity where
you have to also understand what's the
weather going to look like. What am I
looking for on this roof? How do I
understand whether or not there's damage
and whether there's not damage? What am
I looking for? Where am I looking? And
then on the back end of the delivery of
the product, you have to make sure that
it looks good. You're taking the right
pictures. The the client's happy. You
might even need to do light editing on
the back end. So that may sound like a
lot, and I think for most people it
would be a big deterrent. But when I
look at that, I'm like, as far as
regulated things go, we're probably
talking about 40 hours of learning.
Okay, I got to go take a course.

[13:00]
Okay, I got to go take a course.
&gt;&gt; And that slight barrier to entry means
it's less likely to have more
competitors, right? Whereas 10 years
ago, you didn't need a license.
&gt;&gt; No. And thankfully, you do need a
license now cuz I like nobody wants just
random people flying drones over their
house. So there is a little bit of time
obviously that you have to spend getting
up and running in order to start a
business like this, but that's what
makes it really attractive is the moat
is big and there is friction there, but
it's not so big that I'm not even going
to try and actually figure this stuff
out if that makes sense. Yeah. And these
are drones you can buy on Amazon. Like
it you don't have need a special license
to buy these. Like a good solid drone to
get you in business is like DJI Mavic 3.
There's an enterprise and a thermal
version. They're between like 1,200 and
3500 bucks. You can get in business for
few grand on a credit card in this
business. Probably the most important
things that you're going to need is
obviously you're going to need the
drone. You're going to need insurance
because I mean drones are not cheap. And
I mean we we know this in our treeing

[14:00]
I mean we we know this in our treeing
business. Sometimes you mess up and you
cut a line or you cut a a water mane or
whatever. So you want insurance that is
protecting you. There's also software.
As I was doing the research, the thing
that will probably intimidate me the
most is not the lensure for the FAA. It
would be understanding what a good or a
bad roof is. Thankfully, there's a lot
of software already out there that you
can go get off of the shelf that you
then run your pictures through that
helps you identify those things, but you
you still as a human need to understand
what you're looking for as you're doing
a lot of this work. So, the software
does cost some, but yeah, probably out
the door less than 10 grand to really
get up and running in a business like
this. I don't think I listed out all the
different industries that this serves. I
think I interrupted myself. ADHD took
took hold of me. So insurance is number
one. That's 40% of the market. Roughly
20% of the market is roofing, which
makes sense, commercial residential.
Number three, property managers and
commercial real estate, right? You got
to find out if there's a leak or

[15:00]
to find out if there's a leak or
something. You got to keep it
maintained.
&gt;&gt; Then you got home inspection companies,
right? And I smell a piggyback
opportunity there. Then construction and
solar panel companies uh in that order.
&gt;&gt; So what do you like about those
industries?
&gt;&gt; What I really like about those
industries is the fact that there's a
lot of them. It's not just new
construction inspection in order for
them to get to code. That would be like
a really narrow use case. It's not a bad
use case, but it just be a really narrow
use case. I like the fact that there's a
anything with real estate that's
managed. That's how I would look at it.
Anything with real estate that's
managed, there's an entry port. So, it
could be HOAs, it could be commercial
property managers, it could be school
districts, universities, churches,
sporting events, it could be
construction companies, it could be,
like you said, solar companies, roofing
companies. Like, there's a really broad
smattering of businesses that do this.
And the reason I like it is because it
gives you optionality as you're getting
into this to just think about who do I

[16:00]
into this to just think about who do I
know? Like I would bet anybody who's
entrepreneurial could look at these and
be like, I think I know somebody. I
think I know Jim in the construction and
just whatever. I know we'll talk about
this later, but that would be make so
much easier for me to understand how to
actually get into the market and get a
first sale.
&gt;&gt; I got a little pro tip here as well for
our listeners viewers. You don't want to
call it an inspection, okay? Because if
you call it an inspection in certain
states, it can trigger additional
licensing requirements. So, the experts
say that you want to call it roof
condition documentation
specifically. You don't want to put the
word inspection in your business name
particularly or you'll be subject to
more licensing.
&gt;&gt; But like that stuff's really important
for roofing companies in particular,
which is kind of the the main one people
target because they've got to they've
got to go measure everything. They got
to every single piece of it and then
they've got to map it and then got
they've got to order
&gt;&gt; the roof. by not saying inspection. I
guess that that even is a differentiator

[17:00]
guess that that even is a differentiator
as you go to those roofing companies.
I'm not I'm not doing inspection. I'm
just like helping you. I'm just helping
you like me.
&gt;&gt; We're just Hey, we're just talking here.
&gt;&gt; Hey, there's nothing illegal going on
here. M
&gt;&gt; where Boston came from?
&gt;&gt; I don't know. I don't know.
&gt;&gt; So, anytime you're starting a business,
there's like two main components to the
equation. There's getting business and
there's fulfilling that business. That's
it. As you grow and as you scale, more
and more things come into play. It's
like, well, how do I manage people? How
do I manage finances? How do I make sure
that there's quality control with the
product? But like in the beginning, in
the beginning, it's just can I get
business and can I fulfill it? And we
are going to talk about how to get
business in this in this type of
business towards the end. I want to talk
about right now like the fulfillment of
it. The reason I love this business is
because you can do the fulfillment of
it. Like it's the perfect side hustle
kind of transition into
entrepreneurship. And on top of that,
there are sites where companies farm out
drone jobs. So, like you could get paid
to go and learn how to fly a drone by
going and working for a company that

[18:00]
going and working for a company that
just needs a local drone operator to go
and capture stuff. So, like it's even
easier than just going in your first job
and potentially screwing it up. Like,
you can go and practice with a company
who's outsourcing it to you, get some
experience, and then go and do your
first job. So, I just think the
operational complexity to actually do
the fulfillment is simple enough for an
individual to go and do it. Like, like
side hustle work into a job like this.
You don't have to think, oh, I got to
quit my job and go all in on roof
inspections. I think it'd be a good
business for a roofer to start or for
anyone in home services, someone that's
already tangential to it
&gt;&gt; or somebody who has the relationships in
that space that could piggyback that
they could just like piggyback off of
anybody who knows the construction or or
anyways. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Or how many like roofing marketing
agencies are out there or companies that
serve the roofing industry? Like you
could piggy back on one of them. Say,
"Hey,
&gt;&gt; totally.
&gt;&gt; Hook me up with your customers. I'll
give you a 30% referral fee." Whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's not let's not
jump the gun on top.
&gt;&gt; We're not doing customer acquisition
yet.
&gt;&gt; Chris, come on dude.
&gt;&gt; Sorry. Got to keep that to the end so

[19:00]
&gt;&gt; Sorry. Got to keep that to the end so
people watch the whole thing. Got it.
Sorry. I'm sorry everyone. It's called
Trickle Truth. Have you ever heard of
Trickle Truth?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; All right.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Have you seen anybody doing this? I know
it's a fairly small industry at this
point, but I'm starting to see more and
more people kind of pop up and actually
start these kind of businesses.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I I was looking for stories
specifically of people that like
bootstrapped it. I found a couple
stories of this Harvard guy that raised
a bunch of money, yada yada yada. But
this guy named Tom Powers started a
business and would you believe what
caused him to start it? He was a roofing
inspector and he fell off a roof. And he
basically had that moment where he was
saying, "What am I doing with my life?
Why am I getting on roofs?" So he went
out and bought a DJI Inspire 1 Pro. He
took his FAA 107 course. He passed it.
It was 175 bucks to take that, by the
way.
And now he is doing seven figures a year
inspecting roofs.
&gt;&gt; What
&gt;&gt; he takes? That's right. He takes 50 to
60 photos per inspection. He spends 15

[20:01]
60 photos per inspection. He spends 15
minutes per inspection. He can do two
inspections on one battery and his
customers replace half of their manual
roof inspections with his drone roof
inspection. It's not always possible.
Sometimes you still got to get up there,
but half is pretty dang good.
&gt;&gt; Seven figures. How many How many years
did it take him to get to seven figures?
&gt;&gt; I think four.
&gt;&gt; Oh my gosh, that's nuts.
&gt;&gt; Do you know where he makes all his
money?
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; Storms.
Okay. Every time there's a storm, he
makes 15 to $30,000 in inspections.
&gt;&gt; Oh my.
&gt;&gt; Gosh.
Well, and it's not only higher volume,
but it's higher margin as well because
often times he'll he'll inspect half of
the homes on a street because the
storm's hitting all the same homes, you
know, so it's super efficient for him.
&gt;&gt; You know what would be a really
interesting conversation is the
economics of storms.
&gt;&gt; I'm pretty sure it was you when we were
missionaries. You grew up in Florida and
you would tell me about these guys who
after a storm would just come through

[21:00]
after a storm would just come through
with their trailer and like FEMA would
pay them a bunch of money to go clear
up.
&gt;&gt; Those guys were me. That was me as a
16-year-old. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And you would make freaking bank because
FEMA needs the cleanup and and like
they're paying out these funds and so so
are the insurance companies.
&gt;&gt; That was a whole game, too. You get like
a one of those cheap trailers, you know,
&gt;&gt; then you get these huge sheets of
plywood to build up the sides of it
&gt;&gt; to make it like a box trailer with an
open top and then you just you go pick
up all the brush you can. And it's all
about density. You just shove it in
there as densely as you can. and you
barely get the door closed. And then the
FEMA will have like a a station where
you roll your truck up and there'll be a
guy in like a scissor lift. He'll be
standing way up there and he'll look in
it and he'll just yell out. He's like,
"Uh, 82%." Uh, 45%.
&gt;&gt; I swear he's guessing the density of the
trailer. And then they'll pay like a
dollar, like certain dollar amount per
pound. I don't remember what it is.
Let's say it's, you know, a dollar per
pound. So, they'll weigh your trailer.
You pull it up on a weigh station.

[22:01]
You pull it up on a weigh station.
They'll weigh it. Let's say it's 1,200
1,200 lb. And then they unload you. Then
he guesses the density. Uh 82%. Then
they like basically put a strap in there
and they pull it out with this skid
steer. And then they weigh your trailer
again and they're like, "Oh, 400 lb.
1,200 400 800 lb worth of debris. Cool."
And then they take the 800 times $1 per
pound, $800. And then they multiply it
by the percentage density, you know,
83%. Really? And then they hand you a
check right there from FEMA. Like
they'll print it out and hand it to you.
And then you go back to the
neighborhoods and it's you're literally
just picking up anything that's in any
neighborhood because it's just the
government paying for it. And you just
work as fast as you can. You fill it up
and you go back and you do it all over
again until all the the It's awesome.
Isn't that awesome,
&gt;&gt; dude? That is nuts. There's just a FEMA
way station. You just pull up to the
FEMA way station. He's like, "Hey,
what's up?" Yeah, that's a 45.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Like slip them a 50. You're like,
"Could you make it 65?"
&gt;&gt; That's about the same percentage of the
Cowboys in the playoffs. 0%.
Hon, I I totally forgot about that

[23:02]
Hon, I I totally forgot about that
experience until you asked me about it.
That was those were good times. I would
skip school to do that.
&gt;&gt; I remember you telling me about that on
our mission and I was like, "Shut the
freak." You just drive around and like
cut stuff up and throw it in the back of
your truck. You're like, "Yeah." Yeah,
man. It was freaking fun. Danny would
drive around, tell us where to go. It
was Danny, right?
&gt;&gt; No, it was it was a church thing. But
&gt;&gt; Oh, well, if it was a church thing, you
did it for free. No, it wasn't a like
guys from church. But
&gt;&gt; well, anyways, I I think the storm thing
is super interesting. Roofing companies
do this as well where they're like, "Oh,
the storm's hitting in this area and
they've got a weather report and then
they'll like cold message people who are
in that area to go and find business."
If you were to do this as a drone
company though, I don't understand.
Like, would you fly your drone up and
just look for houses with damaged
roofing roofs?
&gt;&gt; I think it's a matter of having the
roofing business contacts already in
place when a storm hits. So you could do
the flip too, right? Like you could go
up and fly it, identify roofs, send
leads to the roofing company, and then
&gt;&gt; little bottoms up approach.

[24:00]
&gt;&gt; little bottoms up approach.
&gt;&gt; The old bottoms up of in business. I
learned that at UCLA.
&gt;&gt; That's the classic bottoms up.
&gt;&gt; Classic classic bottoms up. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I learned that at Alabama when all the
guys would just get drunk every night.
Bottoms up.
&gt;&gt; Oh, Alabama University. No, no, no, no.
Just living in Alabama.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Life. Quick question. What if
there were a private community out there
of people that were building businesses
based on this podcast? Well, I just made
it and it's only for business starters
and business builders. It's called TK
owners and it's basically like having me
and 100 other business geniuses as your
business partner. Also, there's going to
be exclusive new trends, growth hacks,
business ideas, and a database of
everything I've ever talked about.
You'll find thousands of startup case

tkowners.com. Link in the show notes.
Yeah, like he he makes good money
without storms, but like the bulk of his
profit comes from these storms. And
he'll he'll definitely become a

[25:01]
he'll he'll definitely become a
stormchaser if one hits like three hours
away. He'll go up there and get it get
it done.
&gt;&gt; Dude, that seven figures in four years
is is insane to me. Do you know if he
has any like a ton of employees or is it
just him?
&gt;&gt; He's got a few employees. I think he has
like two or three crews. A couple things
to look out for. Metal roofs. It's just
a whole different animal because you get
interference with the signal.
&gt;&gt; So that was a learning curve for him.
And confrontational
onlookers. That's a thing. Karens, male
Kairens. Can you just picture like a
68-year-old dude wearing like a Tommy
Bahama shirt rolling up in his flip-flop
saying, "Hey, what's that drone? What's
that drone? Are you from the deep state?
What's that? You are not authorized.
I'll tell you what. You do not look like
David. And I don't think Bashiba's up on
that roof. What are you doing over here,
boy?
&gt;&gt; You don't look like you're from around
here, boy.
&gt;&gt; I could totally see.
&gt;&gt; That's a big problem.
&gt;&gt; I could Dude, I could totally see that.
&gt;&gt; Freaking Karens.

[26:00]
&gt;&gt; Freaking Karens.
&gt;&gt; What they have to do is they'll have
like their iPhone on a tripod recording
like outwardly as they're standing on
the sidewalk filming. they'll have a
tripod out to like cover their butts in
case there's an onlooker because the
onlook lookers will like try to report
them and get them in trouble even though
they're doing nothing wrong, right? And
they don't want to do anything wrong or
they'll get their license revoked. So,
it's it's very costly to them if they
get reported. But I was thinking like
what an opportunity this could be to use
these Karens as social media content to
grow your business.
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's that's
&gt;&gt; like get rally everyone on your side,
right? What's the male version of a
Karen? Ken. Is it Ken? I don't know.
&gt;&gt; I think it's Kevin and Karen. So, we're
talking about Kevin's here. Sorry,
Kevin's. Yeah,
&gt;&gt; I like Karen better. Call them all
Karen's.
&gt;&gt; Okay, that's that's fair,
&gt;&gt; dude. Or like legitimately, you would
just hire somebody
&gt;&gt; ask someone you know to be that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Anyway, just have a friend film
for you.
&gt;&gt; You could just hire a friend, have them
stand in like you don't it doesn't have

[27:00]
stand in like you don't it doesn't have
you just manufacture it. You know what I
mean?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And and then just try to have it go
viral. That would be a really really
good organic social marketing campaign.
&gt;&gt; I would try to like elicit it.
&gt;&gt; Of course you would. You would show up
there with like the loudest drone
possible. You would put like a a Bitcoin
mining rig on a drone just so the fans
just
&gt;&gt; Oh man.
&gt;&gt; And when they came up to you, you would
just be such a troll. You like, "What? I
can't what?"
&gt;&gt; It's like spraying pesticides
everywhere. It's one of the pesticide
drones.
Here's a couple things that I found
interesting. One is what it takes for a
job to be completed. And the other thing
is, uh, the old land and expand after
you start doing these drone uh,
inspections. There's there's a ton of
things that you can kind of expand into.
So, first, the actual job itself. I
didn't realize this. It's not just you
show up, you fly the drone for 45
minutes, and you get 600 bucks. So, it's
not just show up, show up, and 45
minutes later you're done with the job
and you get $600, and that's all you
have to do. You actually have to do some

[28:01]
have to do. You actually have to do some
prep. So, you need to first of all, even
before the weather, is this close enough
to an airport where you have to get a
permit? And if it's close enough, then
you have to request a permit. And then
you need to look and see what's the
weather going to be like. Then you need
to pull up the roof on Google Maps and
just kind of understand the layout so
that when you show up, you know exactly
what you're shooting for. Then you show
up early. You just make sure you do the
equipment check. You roll out. You
actually do the video. You're there for
like two hours. Great. Then you go back.
You export all the data. You upload the
files. You upload it to the software.
you do your analysis. So, I thought that
was interesting because it's not just,
oh, I'm going to go up and do, you know,
10 roofs a day. You you can't you could
probably do, let's call it, two roofs a
day given all the other administrative
work that you have to do. So, there is
kind of a a ceiling, if you will, on an
individual who can grow their business.
&gt;&gt; It's always more difficult than you
anticipate at the outset.
&gt;&gt; But, here are a couple cool things that
I thought uh were really interesting for
these types of drone businesses. In
software, there's this concept called
land and expand, which means you get

[29:01]
land and expand, which means you get
into a company with a product offering
and then once you're in that company,
then you kind of expand into adjacent
offerings, right? So, Slack might land
by being a messaging app. And then all
of a sudden, they offer, oh, you can do
video conferencing. Here's an upsell for
that. Oh, you can use it as a CRM.
Here's an upsell for that. Oh, you can
use it for email. Here's an upsell for
that. So, for these drone companies, and
I thought these were really cool ideas.
One of them would be you go and you
obviously do the inspection for a
roofing company. You give them their
package and then you say, "Hey, do you
want to use any of this video for your
social media?" Like, what roofing
company would say no to that? Like it's
you went up, you shot it. It's already
there.
&gt;&gt; It's easy for them to post.
&gt;&gt; Boom. Right there. So potentially you
could just shoot social media as an
add-on for each one of these companies.
I thought that was really cool.
&gt;&gt; It's like Uncle Clark,
&gt;&gt; dude. Yes. Yeah. Full circle. Another
one that I thought was really
interesting was inventory management. I
know that sounds weird, but think about
it. When you are going and doing a

[30:01]
it. When you are going and doing a
commercial project and you're building
&gt;&gt; these massive buildings,
&gt;&gt; where do you store the lumber or the
cement or the steel or whatever,
&gt;&gt; you store it on site. It's not like it's
sitting in an Amazon warehouse, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. these drone companies are actually
going and they'll go and like on a
specific day and they'll fly capture
what materials are actually on site and
then if anything happens that there's
like hey you didn't ever deliver this.
It's like actually we did we have video
footage right here of when it was
delivered on this day and you might
offer that as like a weekly monthly
quarterly whatever for these
construction companies but that way it
protects them from a risk management
standpoint on their inventory. Well,
especially you might already be
contracted with them to like inspect the
building as it's going up, right? So, it
might be a great land and expand moment.
&gt;&gt; I'm glad you mentioned the social media
aspect because
a lot of what I researched is was uh
like drone operators saying don't get
into drone photography. Like that is the
lowest hanging fruit. There's no barrier
to entry. There's no moat. And I quote,

[31:01]
to entry. There's no moat. And I quote,
"It's easier for a photographer to learn
drone craft than for a drone operator to
learn photography." So to your point,
that strengthens your point. Start with
the more difficult thing. It's getting
licensed, finding customers, like doing
drone roof inspections, and then going
for the photography thing because a lot
of these guys are going to need
photography, like drone photography
anyway, at some point. It might as well
be you. But if you lead with that, then
you just look like everyone else. But if
you know, you offer that once you
already have their trust, then you get
two lines of business.
&gt;&gt; It's kind of like uh what do you say?
sawdust businesses.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Sell your sawdust.
&gt;&gt; Like you you already have the images.
You already did it for the inspection.
You're you're making money off of your
sawdust.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I think that's a really cool way to
expand. I like the idea that you just
had though of like
&gt;&gt; when you're on site and you and you're
doing for like these construction
companies an inspection, you're like,
"Hey,
&gt;&gt; for an extra 50 bucks, I could just
really quickly do an inventory

[32:00]
really quickly do an inventory
management or inventory check for you.
Is that cool?"
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. That sounds fine. Cool. I'll
I'll shoot that over to you. Like it's
almost like a impulse buy at at the
supermarket. You know what I mean? Like
I didn't need this gum, but I'll go
ahead and grab it.
&gt;&gt; I would bet that those construction
companies would be like, "Yeah, you
might as well." I mean, you're already
up there that
&gt;&gt; Well, dude, why not do the Uncle Clark
method? Like, let's say you a roofer
hires you to inspect a roof, right? You
do that. Then you get some good pictures
while you're up there. Then you go knock
on the homeowner's door. You already
sold the imagery to the roofer and say,
"Hey, can you get it printed?" I think
it's very important that it's printed
just like Uncle Clark. and say, "Hey, I
took this of your house. Uh, it's 50
bucks. You know, thought you might like
it." Or something. Why not?
&gt;&gt; Dude, that would be an interesting
business to do residentially. Although,
I bet people get really weird about that
if you went and took like drone pictures
of people's houses and
&gt;&gt; without their consent.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, never mind. I take that back. You
get a lot of Karens.
&gt;&gt; Hey, weird is viral. Viral is profit.
Profit is good. Why use any word

[33:00]
Profit is good. Why use any word
&gt;&gt; when you word do trick?
Speaking of pricing, I I learned that
pricing has collapsed in this industry.
And I do think that's a good thing. 8 10
years ago, you could charge 2 to 3,000 a
day for your drone skills. And then
licensing happened and then everyone got
involved. And then social media, short
form video, drones went crazy. And now
pricing has like collapsed or stabilized
depending on how you look at it. And
believe it or not, the number of
licenses every year has been dropping
recently. So, I feel like this industry
like it got really hot and it kind of
peaked and then it came down and now
it's stabilizing and starting to get hot
again with this compound annual growth
rate that we talked about in the
beginning.
&gt;&gt; Well, I'm what I'm surprised you didn't
mention is the fact that the pricing has
compressed has been accelerated by how
much cheaper the technology has become.
So these cameras, so like the thermal
imaging cameras or the drones that uh
the cameras fly on, obviously they've
come way down in price from like $20,000

[34:02]
come way down in price from like $20,000
to, you know, $3 to $5,000. So because
of that movement in price, it is it has
allowed the that drone operators
actually charge to be compressed because
now the cost of it is way lower.
&gt;&gt; If you were just looking at it from the
outside, it'd be like, wait a second,
&gt;&gt; they introduced the licensing. Wouldn't
that mean that it would drive the price
up because there's now a barrier for
operators? But actually, because the
price of technology has come down so
much, pricing has come down.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Should we talk about customer
acquisition?
&gt;&gt; Dude, this I've been Yes.
&gt;&gt; Oh, I like that.
&gt;&gt; I want I want you to go.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; No, go ahead. You go, girl.
&gt;&gt; This is not a big industry, but I just
thought it was really cool. The coolest
application of drones that I found in my
research is the drone deer hunters. So,
there is a company out there that are
constantly going viral on social media
that uses thermal imagery drones to find
deer that have been shot by hunters, ran

[35:00]
deer that have been shot by hunters, ran
off, and who knows where. Like trophy
deer. And they'll pay them thousands of
dollars to drive wherever they are to
drive to wherever they are in Ohio,
Pennsylvania, and get their drone up
there and find a deer just hanging out
in the brush that's been shot like in
the leg or something.
&gt;&gt; No way.
&gt;&gt; That's a thing. Yeah,
&gt;&gt; that is insane.
&gt;&gt; That's a thing.
&gt;&gt; Here's why I love love love this
industry, and it's because of the
customer acquisition. Like I said,
there's two parts of the business.
There's the fulfillment, and then
there's the acquiring of the customers.
What I would do after I've decided, yep,
this is for me. I've got my license. I'm
ready to roll. I would just sit down and
I would start writing out names of
people who I know that might fit in to
working in one of these industries. You
ready? Might fit into one of these
industries. Real estate agents,
construction management, those could be
general contractors. It could be
commercial construction companies, etc.
roofing insurance adjusters, commercial
property management companies,
facilities management companies, solar
installation companies, restoration and
remediation companies, engineering and
architecture firms, building inspectors
and home inspectors, governmental

[36:00]
and home inspectors, governmental
agencies, large schools, districts and
colleges, healthcare systems, retail
chains, hospitality and entertainment
companies, the list goes on and on.
Anybody with like facilities management
experience, I guarantee if you're
getting into this business and you just
started listing out names or you just
listened to me list those off, there's
got to be one person who's come to your
mind that's like, I think Greg works for
&gt;&gt; Xandy. I I think I could talk to him
about potentially going into this
business. So, I would that's where I
would start. I would just start by
thinking, who can I piggyback off of to
start getting my first taste of business
so that I can as a side hustle launch
this business? What do you think?
&gt;&gt; I love it. I mean, you could spend the
same amount of mental energy finding
thinking of like one person you know
that could be a customer. Why do that
when you can spend the same energy
thinking of one person you know that you
could get endless referrals from? That's
what's so cool about this industry. It's
like a one to many. You know, you get
property management company or a roofing
company and all of a sudden it's like
I've got sustained business. It's not a
one-off. It's going to be recurring
revenue that I can piggyback off of and

[37:02]
revenue that I can piggyback off of and
I don't have to do it full-time. Cool. I
can I can do it as a side hustle. Throw
me a business. Throw me a job. When you
have a job that comes my way, great.
I'll start getting some practice.
&gt;&gt; I got some alpha on keywords to bid on.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Is there an arbitrage on these
keywords?
&gt;&gt; Little bit. Little bit of arbit. Little
arb.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Drone facade inspections.
&gt;&gt; That's the key word. Like drone roof
inspections. It's too expensive of a
keyword. Drone facade, less expensive.
same results.
&gt;&gt; Can I ask a really dumb question? When
you say keywords, we're talking
specifically about Google. We're not
talking about getting Facebook ads.
Okay.
&gt;&gt; Correct. Yeah. Basically trying to rank
organically for drone roof inspection
near me. Like if you build your website
and your Google business profile, I
didn't think the Google business profile
would really move the needle much on
this, but it does. If you point it
towards drone roof inspection near me,
and then on the paid ad side, if you're
bidding on drone facade inspection, that

[38:02]
bidding on drone facade inspection, that
seems to be the winning ticket here.
Dude, that's a really smart combination.
So you because you could build out your
Google business profile, that just takes
time, energy, right?
&gt;&gt; Be operating this as a side hustle,
finding customers as you go, probably
making sure, like we saw this with
Tyler, making sure that every single
person that you do drone footage for
gives you a review. So video is cool,
but you know what's better? Long form
audio via podcast and my newsletter.
tkopod.com.
Go there to subscribe for free to my
newsletter. It's one email a week, very
tactical. And then go to my audio
podcast. Three episodes a week, stuff
like this. You're gonna love it. All
free. No sleazy sales tkopod.com.
&gt;&gt; Tyler, who's doing stump grinding, he
said he's ranking number one in Utah.
And his secret sauce was, I'm going to
go and do Google reviews on on every
single customer.
&gt;&gt; He gets a twofer. He gets reviews from
the homeowner and from the business
owner that refers him for each job.
&gt;&gt; And my my favorite thing that he said is
he's like, I go knock on the door after
every job and I'm like, was the job
good? And they're like, yeah, it was

[39:00]
good? And they're like, yeah, it was
good. would you be willing to leave me a
review? And the homeowner's like, yeah.
And then Tyler's like, I just stand
there. And then they're like, oh, right
now? He's like, yeah, would you pull
your phone out right now and do it? And
they do. And and they do it. And he's
like, being willing to be uncomfortable
and awkward for like 5 seconds moves the
needle on every review. I just thought
that was so beautiful.
&gt;&gt; You know what that brings me back to?
Hey, if uh you read the book and find it
to be true, would you be willing to be
baptized? Oh, for sure. How about How
about Thursday? I'm sorry. What? Like
Thursday the 7th?
&gt;&gt; Where do you think you learned that
from?
&gt;&gt; Oh my dude, that is such a missionary
tactic. But it's so true. Like just
being willing to be awkward for a few
extra seconds pays massive dividends.
&gt;&gt; Very profitable. Yes. Also, bidding on
not just like roof inspections, but
bidding on roof inspections Plano roof
inspe
it's more narrow. If you don't do those
things, the cost per acquisition is like

[40:01]
things, the cost per acquisition is like
pretty high actually. 70 $80. You're
looking at like 30 to $40 per lead and
50% close rate. The big differentiator
is how recurring are these jobs that
you're getting with Google ads. Okay,
here was my question about Google Ads.
Like I thought about doing programmatic
SEO. I also thought about ranking, but
then I in my research at least it was
like there it's not a lot of it's not B
toC. So it's like customers aren't
necessarily going drone inspectors. It's
it's B2B. So, are these businesses like
these roofing companies, are they the
ones who are actually googling? Are you
getting a lot of business from Google or
are they just going out to their
network?
&gt;&gt; I I believe it's like it's businesses
searching for this stuff.
&gt;&gt; Google ads would be one of your key
funnels for getting business.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure. And organic.
&gt;&gt; Before we get to organic,
&gt;&gt; I think programmatic would be great.
&gt;&gt; That's what I was going to add. Okay.
&gt;&gt; That's what I was thinking for it. Which
also ties into your organic, right?
Because like if you're if you're posting
organic content onto the social media
platforms, you can also just crossost

[41:00]
platforms, you can also just crossost
onto your programmatic SEO sites which
then builds more history, back links,
authority, etc. Would you do any paid on
Facebook?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, actually I I was reading from a
couple guys that their return on ad
spend, their ROI for Facebook ads was
like 3:1, 5 to one, right? Every dollar
in gets $3 to5 out. A lot of people
write off Facebook ads when it comes to
B2B, but guess what? Business owners are
on Facebook. Guess what? The algorithm
is so good. They know what business
owners to show it to. Trust the process.
&gt;&gt; Facebook has made so many people money.
&gt;&gt; Did you really?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I said Mark Zuckerberg's made more
people wealthy than anyone on the
planet.
&gt;&gt; Okay, now I feel stupid. I probably saw
that and internalized it. But like
&gt;&gt; I don't know,
&gt;&gt; dude. Like it's a cheat code. It's
literally a cheat code. Oh, I don't want
to go and spend $500,000 to to
understand whether or not there's a
market there. I can go spend $500, see
what the demand is like, adjust my
message, pivot, and then launch again.

[42:00]
message, pivot, and then launch again.
It like it's Anyways, it's incredible.
Okay, so those are your paid acquisition
channels. What would you do on the
organic side?
&gt;&gt; Just best practices for SEO. just
building out your website with good SEO
practices, meta tags, the right
keywords, listing out specific city
names on your website, fully optimizing
your Google business profile, like
adding all the pictures and videos, you
know, soliciting reviews. Most of the
organic leads are going to come before
people ever click through to your
website. It's going to come from your
Google business profile. Two things, the
first thing is I think that if if you're
somebody who understands social media,
this to me is a no-brainer business for
you to post about. It's not that you're
going to blow up, but we've seen like
espeing power washing on YouTube. These
channels get hundreds of thousands or
millions of views just because there's a
very clear before and after. And these
drones, like doing drone footage, it's
just mesmerizing to like watch the
drone. So, if you take a small clip and
post it online, like you have content
every single day. You don't have to be
creative and think up content. So, just

[43:02]
creative and think up content. So, just
by putting it out there, Google is
ranking YouTube video higher and higher
in their search results. It's becoming
the new SEO. So the more video that
you're putting out there, the more that
you're a founder brand, the higher
you're going to rank. So it just
compounds on itself. I I think this is a
perfect business for social
&gt;&gt; and you don't have to show your face.
You don't have to like make stupid
selfie videos like you and I do. You
just freaking post the drone videos.
&gt;&gt; I totally agree.
&gt;&gt; Here's your title wave. This is the
Google Trends data for drone inspection.
&gt;&gt; Oh my gosh, that's a Dude, that's
insane. I can't quite see it. Is that
five years or all time? This is uh 20
years, but it really started picking up
in 2014, which makes sense. Like that's
when drones started getting really
popular.
&gt;&gt; Wow, dude.
&gt;&gt; If we do roof inspection,
&gt;&gt; look at roof inspection. Okay, so if
you're listening to this,
&gt;&gt; it's basically like steady up and to the
right. And then suddenly in December
2024, it went from a 23 relative search
volume out of 100 to 100.

[44:02]
volume out of 100 to 100.
&gt;&gt; Why? right now it's a like what happened
in December of 24? I don't know. Uh
&gt;&gt; fires like I don't know,
&gt;&gt; but this is all time. Like why would it
be that dramatic of a surge in December
of 2024? That's crazy, dude. This is why
I love these businesses. Like, okay.
Yeah, it's not AI was like, "Oh, AI is
growing at 500,000% a year." Oh, I heard
this story about Jeff Bezos when he was
looking at Amazon and he saw the
internet was growing at 5,000%. He
thought, "Any business that's growing
that fast, I got to be a part of like,
okay, cool. We get it. that's growing
fast, but it's kind of easy come easy
go, right? Like you get these companies
that can come out of nowhere and they
can crash out of this steady growing.
It's a real business. Like sign me up
all day. Technology is not changing
overnight on what's required in a roof
inspection. The delivery mechanism might
change, but we all still need roof
inspections. I guess there was a there
was a big tornado outbreak in December

[45:00]
was a big tornado outbreak in December
of 2024 and
&gt;&gt; No way.
&gt;&gt; roof claims reached over $30 billion in
2024. It's crazy.
&gt;&gt; Holy crap.
&gt;&gt; Is it time for us to talk about our our
roofing inspection course, Nick?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Listen, you don't have to
pay it right away. Have Have you ever
heard of affirm?
&gt;&gt; A firm? CLA?
I think we've said it a number of times,
but do you want do you want to just like
recap like why we love this business?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. You got a title wave, extremely
fast growing market for drone
inspections. You got another title wave
of 50% of insurance adjusters are
retiring. Sorry, was it 50 or Yeah, 50%
top of the industry is retiring. You got
the other title wave, it becoming more
approachable. Drones are more
affordable. The technology is better
than ever. You can start it with not
that much money. net margins between 20
and 50% depending on what model you
choose. The piggyback the piggyback
ability of it to have one customer that

[46:00]
ability of it to have one customer that
can refer you tons of jobs. You want
insurance, go insurance. You want
roofing, commercial, residential, solar.
There's all kinds of verticals here.
What did I miss?
&gt;&gt; Pretty much have everything that I have.
These the only two I would expand on are
it's a perfect side hustle business. You
don't have to quit your job and go
full-time. like you can you can start
doing a couple of these a month, get the
experience, make some and make some real
money. I love that fact of it. And then
the only other thing to add on other
than what you've said, I also love the
land and expand nature of this business
because you're building relationships
with property management companies and
commercial real estate companies and
construction companies. And even if this
doesn't become your forever job, now all
of a sudden you've built relationships
with real businesses, real business
owners. Maybe you find a new need or a
new niche or it opens up another door
for you. Like it just gets you in the
game in an industry like real estate
which has so many opportunities built
within it. So I love kind of that nature
of land and expand the side hustle and
