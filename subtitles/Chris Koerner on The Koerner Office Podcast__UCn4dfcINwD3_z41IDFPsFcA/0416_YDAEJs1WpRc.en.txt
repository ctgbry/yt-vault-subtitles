look at this freaking lady right here
she had a problem and she solved it she
had this big chicken coop and she had no
way of cleaning up all the poop now yeah
they sell tools for this but she didn't
like any of them very much so she
created what she calls the coupe scoop
with the cost of manufacturing coming
down 3D printing being where it is and
the power of social media you can just
do things you know how many people told
her oh that's dumb oh this is too Niche
who's going to spend extra for a chicken
poop cleanup tool she didn't care she
just did it so if you want to get
something manufactured or imported from
China just do it I've been doing it for
15 years I'm not a genius it's not that
hard full s right here for free
