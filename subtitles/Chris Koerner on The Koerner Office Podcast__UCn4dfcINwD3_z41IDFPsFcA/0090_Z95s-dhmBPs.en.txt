[00:00]
you purchased a street sweeping company
in Southern
California and you were selling some
residential some to HOA construction
companies and you were just starting to
get into it
right correct yeah yeah I was about
probably four months into running the
operation and we had had it probably
since May last year so we're about
coming up on a year mark okay all right
now what did I suggest what was your
core question and what did I suggest
back then
I think I was just looking how to grow
it this is my first run at
entrepreneurship I just finished a
baseball career and came across this
business low risk and so you to I think
you took a look at our website you took
a look at our Google my business profile
you mentioned just get some reviews
start working on SEO double down on the
Google ads that that had been working so
keep doing what's working and then
figure out some sort of cold Outreach
which has been good like we've just

[01:01]
which has been good like we've just
found some associations locally and all
that and yeah we're just doubling down
on all that awesome so what type of cold
Outreach have you done so a lot of it
has been just getting lists from I think
outs scraper things like that and
whether it's homeowners associations
commercial property managers and then I
joined a contractor Association that's
like local and so that'll get our
construction side going so it's just a
mix of cold calling cold emails and
following up on any past leads things
like that and do you have any stories
like a specific customer or instance you
remember of a time that cold Outreach
worked and what is that story the cold
Outreach has been slow one of them we
have we have a big construction company
in our area that it could lead to a lot
of jobs and they weren't even aware that
we were a company and yeah just a phone
call led to that and then I had a a

[02:02]
call led to that and then I had a a
phone call with a gentleman that he
owned a parking lot in our area and I
asked if he had some other properties as
well and he pointed me to yeah he wanted
some pressure washing for a parking
garage that's at near LAX it's like a
seven story garage working on getting
that one hopefully and that would be
probably a month of Revenue just in
itself yeah that'd be nice like it would
be the equivalent of a whole month of
revenue for your company yeah wow yeah
now do you do and we would Outsource all
of it nice that was my so you don't do
pressure washing you would just sub it
out yeah yeah now what on that job
specifically what did the unit economics
look like what would the Top Line be and
what would it cost you to sub it out so
it took a bunch of research but I found
that I could get someone who I could
trust not to like flood this thing and
put me in a lot of trouble who's done
these size jobs before and it probably

[03:00]
these size jobs before and it probably
would cost me about 30 to
35,000 and I actually had asked the
customer like hey have you done this
before I don't know if you understand
how big of a job this is and he said
yeah we did it two years ago but we only
did half of it and I think we we did it
for 30,000 so he gave me the number
which was really nice very helpful and
yeah so I quoted him I think 55 or
something like that for the whole
building okay which I confirmed with a
bunch of other guys that are I think
mostly through Twitter and they said
anywhere from the 50 to 60 range would
probably be based on the square footage
and everything man pressure washing
parking garages I didn't even know that
was a thing that is a lot of
money yeah that's the next Avenue that I
want to add to so I don't have to
Outsource it all because we've gotten
probably four or five leads on it in the
last two months only one of them has
landed and it was a pretty small job so

[04:00]
landed and it was a pretty small job so
waiting until it makes sense for us to
invest in that what would it cost you so
he didn't bulk at the 55
grand no he he has to his thing was he
has to go get it approved by his BP or
whoever uh is above him and he said they
were planning for either mid to late
summer for this job okay and what's it
going to cost you to Outsource that
about 30 to 35 man for everything so you
have to pressure wash the entire thing
or they will it's most yeah it's mostly
pavement so I have to sweep it came from
a sweeping job that I I would sweep it
first get all the debris and then yeah
they would it's basically get all the
oil stains up and then it's mostly just
the pavement not any of the building or
anything okay um and then making sure
all the gum and just stuff that gets
stuck over time now is this just for
aesthetic purposes or is there some

[05:00]
aesthetic purposes or is there some
regulation requiring this I'm not
totally sure on the parking lots like
what is regulated as far as the pressure
washing I know the first couple of
levels are like their VIP section so he
was like hey I need a like a deep clean
for this so I think it's more for looks
of it but I think there also is like an
element of not having to invest in more
pavement resurfacing and all that over
time if you maintain it so I think
longterm it saves you money I know
that's the case for sweeping at least
for asphalt and all that that stuff but
so I I would say there's some sort of
benefit other than just
looks man my mind is buzzing with this I
feel like you're in you're in La how
many parking garages are in La like this
is such a high ticket item you could pay
a full-time guy to just chase down these
parking lot owners and Chase down these
five figure jobs all day every

[06:00]
five figure jobs all day every
day yeah that's what I'm realizing so
we're in ventur about probably an hour
and a half yeah hour and a half outside
of LA but yeah the if I even if I could
get these jobs and sub them all out like
it would be less of a headache and um
pretty decent cash flow so I love the
model of subbing everything out until
you you feel comfortable enough to do it
yourself and you've drisk so we do this
in the tree business we sub everything
out we literally don't own a chainsaw
but at this point we're looking to buy a
tree company in DFW that doesn't sub
anything out because we feel confident
enough that we know how to run the
business that we could just boost our
margins so our perfect scenario is buy a
a cash flowing Tree Business that's
doing a million dollars a year in net
profit come in there put our marketing
on it put my operating partner on it
who's an amazing operator and just boost
the margins boost the topl line with
better marketing and so back to you I

[07:01]
better marketing and so back to you I
think street sweeping and commercial
pressure washing go hand inand because
you're going to have to do a run through
this first anyway and I feel like yeah
anytime you do a job like this you're
going to have to run through it and so
if I were you I would get a I would go
to Rami which is a website that I like
to use for scraping data and honestly
you can scrape with a virtual assistant
everything you need during their onewe
trial they're not going to like me
saying this but whatever you get a
because it's super expensive you get a
onewe trial okay and I have a VA um that
I can refer to you that I've used for
this and he can go in and you can make a
very specific search for LA County
Orange County whatever you're doing for
parking garages or for parking lots or
whatever it is maybe just everything
over an acre or under an acre and scrape
it all out get as much data as you can
and then just start hitting that list
with someone local not a VA either you

[08:01]
with someone local not a VA either you
or a partner or an employee and just
start learning learning how much of a
need there is for this I think four
leads over two months for something
that's this High ticket is pretty dang
promising I I usually try to dissuade
them from expanding into other verticals
because they're you they usually have a
1% market share of the vertical that
they're already in but yeah from what I
understand this a goes hand inand with
what you're already doing and B is much
more High ticket because what would if
you were to just sweep this seven story
garage nothing else what would you
charge him it might take maybe five or
six hundred bucks 100a
difference yeah yeah that's crazy and
the capex for the pressure washing is
much lower and replacing something on my
sweeper if something goes down it might
be a
$115,000 um expense so that's the real
part that's difficult with this but yeah

[09:02]
part that's difficult with this but yeah
this so the person I was subbing it out
to he actually reached out to me and I
found out he'd been doing this for about
10 years and he's about he said his Top
Line this year will be around seven to
eight million just with 80% commercial
and then some
residential holy cow so is open my eyes
to what's there is he specializing in
parking garages or just any pressure
washing any pressure washing sand
blasting so like getting any of the
stenciling up they do like some fleet
washing for commercial tractors and
vehicles so they do a little bit of
everything yeah I have to imagine that
it's really easy to sit here on this
call and be like oh yeah do pressure
washing I have to imagine it's very
competitive especially in LA but the
fact like if you were to get on these
cold calls and say we only do pressure
washing for parking garages in LA county
I feel like that sells so much better
than just another pressure washing guy
calling them and first of all I I doubt

[10:01]
calling them and first of all I I doubt
that any pressure washing guys are
calling these guys because they're
probably pretty busy and they're like
people don't want to get on the phone so
they're not competing with cold calls
right I had to call probably 10 people
to find someone and each one when I send
them the address they said no that's
that's way too big for me I can't do
perfect and yeah so it took me like this
guy told me there's probably three or
four within Southern to Northern
California like that could handle a job
this size so yeah I think the
competition definitely goes down once
you start getting into those bigger jobs
what do you think a truck would cost to
do jobs this big if you were to buy it
yourself the guy told me how he would do
it and it was two trucks I think the
equipment if you're getting it like new
and going to keep it for a while would
be anywhere from
40 probably 35 to 40 Grand per truck
like with a truck trailer everything I
think you could probably get it around

[11:00]
think you could probably get it around
3540 so maybe 75 grand to be able to do
two Crews on a job like this they'll pay
for itself in two two three
jobs yeah if you were to only sweep this
how often realistically like I know how
often you'd like to sweep it how often
realistically would someone invite you
back to keep sweeping that only sweep it
would this like a parking garage not it
would only be when they pressure wash
because they're charging people for
airport parking and so they don't want
to if I go and sweep it it's going to be
completely full and we're not anything
done with it so they're going to have to
empty the lot for us to pressure wash it
one or two levels at a time
interesting okay how often do normal
parking lots need to be swept a normal
one it depend like a commercial grocery
store can be I I had one that's every
night but that's a very low margin
you're it's just a race to the bottom
and then the HOAs the nicer communities

[12:01]
and then the HOAs the nicer communities
are probably once a week or once every
other week okay I'm just thinking I know
this isn't even why you called but I'm
latching on to this because it's a this
still recurring like you don't give up
the recurring aspect it's less recurring
it might be 10x less recurring but 100x
bigger ticket size so to me this is the
exact type of asymmetric risk that you
should be taking you don't have to take
any risk but your time and your pride to
to talk to these guys and at least learn
and then once you've subbed it out five
or 10 times you really don't have risk
at that point because those five to 10
jobs hopefully you've been the one
interfacing with them you are the one
with the relationship with them and
they're going to recur in one two three
years right so even if you buy a truck
today and you never get another job
you're still going to be able to do
those jobs again in one two or three
years yeah am I missing something or is
this a big
opportunity I think it's a big
opportunity which is I've been on the

[13:00]
opportunity which is I've been on the
whole YouTube Rabbit Trail for the
pressure washing since this came up the
other pressure washing leads have been
like much smaller but they're still you
know anywhere from 2500 to five grand
for these commercial jobs and yeah I
mean with a sweeper truck like if I'm
sending them to a construction site I'm
pretty happy if each truck is doing
about 2500 a day that's like best case
scenario so yeah to have a a pressure
washing job that I can do after hours
pretty low paying employee and to be
able to do that and get three or five
grand per job I I think there's
definitely a big interest there yeah
okay think of it this way because I've
talked trash on pressure watching in the
past because it's one of the very few
home services that have gone viral on
Tik Tok so there's all kinds of high
schoolers and college kids which I love
out there buying pressure washers from
Home Depot and hustling and I love that
right I don't love it as a competitor
which is why I'm not going into that

[14:00]
which is why I'm not going into that
business but I love that they're doing
it so let's just take this business and
compare it to something with less
competition like fencing let's say every
year in the fencing industry you've got
just to keep the numbers clean a 100
guys coming into the market and 50 guys
going out of the market maybe they're
closing their business entirely and
let's just say that's like a the average
attrition into and out of the fencing
business statistically speaking unless
Americans are getting 50% more fenes
every month then at some point in the
future those companies are in for a
world of hurt and a lot of competition
let's say in the pressure washing
industry it's three times that because
it's gone viral on Tik Tok and fencing
hasn't let's say you've got 300 coming
into the market every month and
150 what that says to me there's
actually a barrier to entry with what
you're doing because of the ticket how
much it's going to cost to buy one of
these dang trucks right and so all else
equal if the top top of the funnel is
three times bigger the top of the funnel

[15:02]
three times bigger the top of the funnel
for the $50,000 truck parking lot
pressure washing industry is the same
size which means that if you're in an
overall industry that's much more
crowded and you find a Subs segment of
that industry that's ignored then you
will statistically be much less crowded
than an average industry like
fencing does that make sense yeah yeah
definitely I would wager that exactly 0%
of these guys being inspired from Tik
Tok are spending 75 grand on a truck but
there still is a growing need for that
market because the economy is growing
and so if you're the guy that takes that
on then I think you'll be even better
primed for Success than someone starting
a fencing business which has not gone
viral on Tik Tok right yeah and I think
that's been my hesitation is I don't
think we would do or I wouldn't pursue
uh residential pressure washing unless I
just got leads out of nowhere but it I

[16:01]
just got leads out of nowhere but it I
would focus on these higher ticket items
or the
sweeping yeah yeah so if I were you I
would make uh I would buy a different
domain name entirely just something
cheap 10 bucks regarding parking garage
pressure washing and maybe that's what
it's called parking garage pressure
wash.com or La parking garage pressure
washing and it's a long domain it's not
pretty but then take your credentials
how long has your company been in
business like before you bought
it uh about 30 years perfect leverage
those credentials on your new landing
page and talk about on this new landing
page how all you do is LA County Park
and garage pressure washing and it can
be a simple website you can put pictures
in there it could be a one pager even
but then when you get on these calls or
I would even throw Google ads at this
landing page and just see what happens
because there's probably very low
traffic but very low competition on
these Google ads and just separate that

[17:00]
these Google ads and just separate that
and it you could put on there like a
subsidiary of your current business name
or something I would really explore that
while you're doing everything that
you're currently doing just to see what
comes from it yeah it would take one job
basically to pay off any sort of thing
like that and two jobs probably to pay
off all the equipment yeah and there's
thousands of those things in the county
I'm sure yeah what did we not get to
that you had a question about with the
street sweeping High cap X we've gotten
it to about 60 Grand a month and it's
about I would say 8 to 12% net margins
because we're definitely investing a lot
into making sure the equipment's back
updated we got a lot of old equipment
when we bought it ads all that sort of
stuff so personally I have a decent
Runway financially a couple years or so
and this is my first go at
entrepreneurship so I don't necessarily
want to take my my chance of two years
or whatever to focus on something that

[18:01]
or whatever to focus on something that
might not be my highest leverage or best
opportunity but it was just the
opportunity that kind of fell in my lap
I have a background obviously in
baseball played 10 years professionally
I haven't done anything really with that
or growing like a brand or anything like
that so I don't know I'm not really sure
if I should just continue just roll on
this learn all the skills of running a
business at like Marketing sales all
that that I didn't know beforehand or or
if I should continue to pursue other
things I know you've had a couple of
segments on the shiny object syndrome
lately but yeah I'd be curious to hear
your thoughts I think that you are in
the exact right place what what was your
if you're at 60 Grand a month today what
were you three months ago when we first
spoke I would say probably 28 to 30 at
that point and then when we bought it we
were at about 15 to 20 okay
so I'm a big advocate of shiny object
syndrome as I talk about but I would

[19:02]
syndrome as I talk about but I would
like there's a difference between shiny
objects inside your industry and outside
so like in my industry quote is
entrepreneurship and so I'm always
chasing shiny objects and I have a a
vehicle called co-founders where I can
place these shiny objects with operators
right I think you're doing something
really special and amazing and the fact
that you have a 30-year-old business
means that it's likely to stay in
business for another 30 plus years
statistically speaking you're in one of
the biggest economies in the world
that's a growing economy that's by the
ocean which means it's not going
anywhere it's not as prone to market
bubbles like Phoenix or Vegas I would
imagine there's dozens of other
competitors you could buy in that market
I would lean hard into street sweeping
and or street sweeping plus like
commercial pressure washing because it's
not going anywhere it's not going to be
disrupted by AI one day there's going to
be a self-driving street sweeping truck

[20:01]
be a self-driving street sweeping truck
and you can buy it and you can cut your
cogs down right like you are almost
immune from technological advances in
fact they're only going to benefit you
so I would keep doing exactly what
you're doing and when you get to the
point where you feel like your growth is
stalled then start looking at acquiring
other businesses in the same space maybe
you acquire a commercial pressure
washing company instead of starting one
from scratch I would also take your
customer list like as soon as possible
possible and reach out to them and ask
if they have any pressure washing needs
because you could have a whole other 60
Grand a month of Revenue already in your
email
list yeah okay that's really helpful
yeah that's what I would do but I think
you're doing something really really
special and I want you to come back on
in a couple months and let's talk
again yeah yeah that'd be great I
appreciate it okay thank you Brandon
