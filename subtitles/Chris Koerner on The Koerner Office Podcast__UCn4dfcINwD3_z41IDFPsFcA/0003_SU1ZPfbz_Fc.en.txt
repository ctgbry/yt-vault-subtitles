Wheel Repair Mobile wheel repair people
are keeping their cars 12 13 15 years
interest rates are liel to stay higher
long for longer um new vehicle purchases
are getting prohibitively expensive
people are going to try and hold on
their car longer keep it keep it looking
nicer longer there's a guy I'm involved
in the Tesla Community as an owner of
two Teslas here in the Midwest and
there's a guy who does everybody's rims
for Teslas in the um St Louis
metropolitan area same guy and I've had
him out to my house twice he does it in
my driveway uh they look like brand new
when he's done I'm like bro like why
aren't we like let's roll this out let's
find some help like I'll fund you let's
go like uh you could go all over the
area you repair somebody's car make it
look like new sitting in their parking
spot at work or in their driveway at
home the work's done in an hour two
tops um what do you think is it scalable
how busy is that guy is it a he's
nonstop this is all he does and and then
if he ever has slow time through um just

[01:02]
if he ever has slow time through um just
business he gets organically through you
know the St Louis uh Tesla fan page on
uh owner Club on Facebook which is where
most of his business comes from he just
um he has relationships with dealers so
if they take in a used vehicle that they
want to put a couple hundred bucks into
a used vehicle and make it look like new
and and fix curb you know curb rash on a
on a rim or two he does that when he's
slow just to keep him busy does the
dealer work but the private you know
just private individuals who find him
organically or is he's he's busy 247 I'm
he's like he's like no I can't find help
I've tried you can't keep anybody you
train somebody then you can't keep them
then they don't show up for work and
he's like it's just it's just not worth
it so I'm you know he's just like
resigned himself to just doing it
himself
yeah are you still there I think are you
there yeah I'm here okay you broke up
for a minute all right so a couple other
questions what is his average ticket uh

[02:00]
questions what is his average ticket uh
size and is he only doing
Teslas oh no he does anything um it's
just the honestly I think just the Tesla
group keeps him super busy here in the
St Louis area but now he'll do anything
um average ticket I think is probably
about 300 bucks for about an hour hour
and a half wor worth of work okay is
that what you paid him and he does a
good job like you can't even tell it's
unbelievable if I sent you pictures
you'd never know and I and my rims are
powder coated and both the vehicles he's
done for me you'd never even know they
were they looked like they just rolled
off the showroom floor okay all right so
I've got everything I need to know I
love this business and for so many
reasons and I I could be biased so I'll
just put it all out there so first of
all my mother-in-law was in town two
weeks ago and uh bless her heart I I
have a Model S and I I let her drive it
and
she she floored it over a pothole and I
have the upgraded Wheels like the AR
wheels and she popped a tire and I was

[03:01]
wheels and she popped a tire and I was
very um angry because I'm like I I read
in all the message boards like these
wheels are so sensitive like so I know
where every pothole is in town I like my
car has never touched anything yeah like
it has never brushed up against anything
and so I I was a little angry um and so
she she popped two of my tires and she
bent the wheel uh Discount Tire told me
it was bent it doesn't look bent I
couldn't tell it was bent but they're
like you know you're going to have
uneven wear on this one Tire I still
haven't fixed it I don't know if he does
uh bent wheels or just curb rash but
that's that's not the point my point is
like I I know there's demand for this
and it's not just because of my sample
size of one it sounds like there's
insane demand in St Louis um I I love
businesses that are built up around
Tesla because I don't know what it is
about that fan base like they are rapid
yep if I tweet about Tesla it goes viral
like I I don't know what it is like I

[04:00]
like I I don't know what it is like I
like my Tesla it's great sure but even I
I don't get it right it's the most
polarizing car brand out there and it's
not even close and so their growth is
clearly insane they're dropping prices
they're they're they're putting out a
bunch more cars um I I think one could
crush it only doing Tesla starting that
way at least even naming the business
like bolt wheel repair or something yeah
and then as you expand and you do non-
Tesla vehicles no one cares that it's
called B right you just change the copy
on on your website to say you do all
vehicles but I'm surprised this isn't
more of like a more of a of a thing like
pressure washing is a is a thing right I
feel like it's the secrets out um yeah
maybe I just don't know many other
places in terms of Roi for car ownership
where you know you and especially when
we're talking about Teslas Chris they
all come off the factory with black rims
now you know like you you Cur Brash them
like it's an isore
immediately

[05:00]
immediately
and just the ROI you get for somebody to
come to your house and do it on in your
driveway or while you're parked at work
just sitting there anyway couple hundred
two two 300 bucks and it looks like new
again well and here's the thing mobile
tire replacement and tire repair is also
becoming more and more there's
franchises with Vans growing like crazy
and so if you build a customer base over
a couple years then you can start you
can start doing tires as well right why
not I've always wondered around Tesla
too um speaking about you know how how
rabbit Tesla fans are why aren't there
some young enterprising kids out there
somewhere who are washing cars at at
superchargers oh like if I'm sitting
there I'm sitting there for 35 minutes
why don't I have why don't I have two
buckets in a a truck with a water tank
in the back and hey how long you
charging oh I'll be here another half an
hour hey I'll wash your car for 25 bucks
Rick I apologize that a thing seeing
your DM because you're like a good tweet
gold mine like I'm I'm getting so much
content from this one segment that
should totally be a thing I don't know

[06:00]
should totally be a thing I don't know
how it's not I mean eventually maybe
somebody with from the city or
municipality wherever the charger is
will come run you out of there but for
trying out loud you could probably was
10 cars a day at one supercharger before
you get run out of anywhere go to well
not just not just that but a lot of
Tesla owners myself included are afraid
to take it through an automatic watch
yeah so M mine's always dirty for that
reason yep if I hate watching it there
are products you know like Optimum no
Rin onr most people call it Optimum no
Rin you don't even need a you don't have
to rinse it you just have a two bucket
system one with clean water one with the
dirty water you don't even you don't
even have to have a power washer or you
know a power wand or spray hose or
anything that could be an upsell at the
supercharges after watch right man that
is a good idea I'm all in on that idea
all right yep you validated everything I
came to you for today
