I have made millions of dollars on
Facebook Marketplace eBay and other
marketplaces by reverse engineering and
growth hacking my way to success so I
just sat down to teach you every single
thing I know about validating a market
size optimizing listing pictures videos
keywords headlines titles and everything
I know about marketplaces to make more
money you will learn today so let's dive
into
[Music]
it so before I start any business that
might rely on Facebook Marketplace for
leads I want to do some competitive
market research I need to know is there
more demand than there is Supply in both
my market and Benchmark markets that
have similar demographics and similar
similar population sizes so I'm doing
research for Plano Texas which has about
290,000 people in it Frisco and mckin
are cities that have similar
demographics and similar population
sizes that just happen to be right next
to Plano so mckin has 215,000 people and
Frisco has 225,000 people they're

[01:00]
Frisco has 225,000 people they're
similar with race age income
demographics so it's a perfect barometer
to know how many competitors am I going
to have if I start XY or Z business that
has to rely on Facebook Marketplace for
leads so I'm going to make a very simple
Google spreadsheet here to keep track of
these listings in competitive markets
then when I set a radius on Facebook
Marketplace I'm going to make it a tight
radius because I don't want to account
for firewood companies an hour away that
might deliver to Plano Texas I I only
want to know which ones are in Plano
Texas because that's the only way I can
keep my variables constant Facebook is
going to show me some listings that have
firewood in the title some that have it
in the description so I'm going to have
to use my common sense to know before
clicking if this is a relevant listing
to me or not so when I search firewood
Plano Texas within five miles here are
the listings that I see that have Plano
listed in the title I don't want to see
Richardson and then click into it and
see deliver to Plano I'm trying to save

[02:01]
see deliver to Plano I'm trying to save
time here and be efficient and get the
8020 of This research without spending 4
hours so I'm just going to look at the
title so I'm not going to worry about
prices yet because some people list it
as free or as $1 just to get more clicks
I just want to see listings so right off
the bat in
Plano I see one two three four five six
7 I see 14 I don't want to keep
scrolling I don't want to go to page two
because I'm just going to see listings
that are less relevant to what I'm
looking for so I'm going to go back to
my spreadsheet I'm going to put 14 under
number of listings and then I'm going to
do the same search in Frisco if I go to
Frisco I see 21 listings very
interesting because Frisco is smaller
than Plano yet it has 50% more
competition so already after 5 minutes
of research it's telling me what I need
to know 21 listings in Frisco and then
mckin will be our last Market 28 okay
for some reason these are all multiples
of seven we go to mckin

[03:00]
of seven we go to mckin
and it looks even more competitive than
Frisco now this is why launching a
business in your home area is so
critical because if I were not native to
the Dallas Fort Worth area I've been
here for 10 years then I might look at
this and say oh wow it's so obvious I
need to launch in Plano because there's
no one doing this in Plano but since I'm
a local I know things like okay mckin
has a huge surface area there's a lot of
rural areas it's further from Dallas so
homes are cheaper there's more vacant
acreage there's more room for someone to
start and run a firewood business Plano
is right up against Dallas it's a little
more urban the lots are much smaller um
there's more infill there's just there's
not a lot left to build in Plano so the
likelihood of someone starting a
firewood business in Plano is much
smaller than someone starting a firewood
business in Frisco or mckin but this is
a good thing if I'm in Plano this means
that there's an opportunity for someone
in Plano to start a business a they're
Less Direct competitors nearby B they're
closer to Dallas where there's two or

[04:01]
closer to Dallas where there's two or
three million more people so I'm going
to do some quick division
here and see what we're working
with okay so there's one firewood
business for every 10,700 people in
Frisco Plano one in every 20,700 people
and in mckin one in every 7,600 people
so this is is interesting because I've
done this research for a tree trimming
business already and I know that one in
10,000 is a pretty good Benchmark if I
launch in Allen Texas which has about
100,000 people I can expect there to be
about nine
competitors 100,000 divided by 10 equals
10,000 so it is kind of curious seeing
that the numbers for firewood businesses
are very similar and perhaps that's
because a lot of the tree trimming
businesses are vertically integrated and
they're selling firewood as well so
right off the bat I know that if I'm in

[05:01]
right off the bat I know that if I'm in
Plano I'm I'm just going to have an
easier time selling this firewood it
doesn't mean I'm I'm going to be more
likely to make the business work it just
means I'm going to have less competitors
and all else equal I would prefer to
have less competitors now I'm going to
talk about listing strategies not just
for Facebook Marketplace but this
applies to any Marketplace maybe you're
selling on Airbnb or on eBay all of
these principles apply to any
Marketplace the three most important
things you can ever do when listing
anything for sale or rent on Facebook
Marketplace or anywhere are these number
one pictures you have to take high
quality pictures you don't need a
professional photographer but you need
professional looking pictures even if
it's with your iPhone take note of
whatever Marketplace you're on how many
pictures or videos do they allow you to
upload keep in mind that these companies
are a lot smarter than us if eBay allows
us to upload 24 photos then they know
that the diminishing returns happen
after 24 photos and it also means that
the most optimal amount of photo phot or
videos to upload is about 24 so don't

[06:02]
videos to upload is about 24 so don't
upload three even if a lot of your
photos look about the same just the
angles are slightly different upload all
of them because it does you no harm also
it's called multimedia for a reason you
don't only want to upload a picture or a
video or multiple pictures or multiple
videos upload everything pictures and
videos from multiple angles especially
because the algorithms will prioritize
specifically Facebook Marketplace will
prioritize listings that lead with a
video because it will stop the scroll
all of these companies want us to stop
scrolling and if we're scrolling and we
see a bunch of pictures and then a video
even if a one second loop we're going to
stop there so a the algorithm will
prioritize it B people will prioritize
it because it looks better so if
Facebook Marketplace enables us to
upload 12 pictures of videos then upload
two videos and 10 pictures or six and
six take advantage of everything that
Facebook allows us to do number two

[07:00]
Facebook allows us to do number two
description you've got to nail as many
keywords as you can so I want to put in
my listing Hickory Oak Post Oak scrub
Oak Ash American ash Elm everything even
if it's not firewood that I sell I still
want it in the listing so I can get more
visibility on my listing and the third
most important thing is responsiveness
the quickest to respond will win if your
notifications aren't completely blowing
up you up on your watch or your phone or
everywhere then you're going to miss out
on not just leads but money you have to
respond to these guys quickly the
Facebook audience is more impatient and
more finicky than any other audience so
take advantage of that because the
people you're competing against I
guarantee you are not going to be as
responsive as you so let's go into some
of these listings here and I'll critique
some of my competitors I click on one
and I can already see it's a blurry
photo like I can barely see it's
firewood he only has three photos this
is taken in the dark the lighting is

[08:00]
is taken in the dark the lighting is
terrible his description firewood for
sale in Plano 1/8 chord or 1/4 chord
pickup or delivered call text Matt for
pricing hidden information here's what
hidden information means it means that
Matt the guy who posted this put his
phone number in there not knowing that
you shouldn't do that Facebook doesn't
want to pull people away from Facebook
so if you put your phone number in there
even if you kind of put weird line
breaks in there they can detect it and
they will suppress not just your actual
phone number but they'll suppress your
listing so it doesn't appear as often
for as many people so you're doing
yourself a disservice if you try to
circumvent Facebook you want to work
with Facebook not against them remember
there're are one trillion doll company
so what I want to do is encourage people
to DM me on Facebook and then have all
my notifications set up because the
algorithm will also know that I'm trying
to keep people on the Facebook platform
and they're going to prioritize my
listings as a result I also want to I
want to list all of my prices okay this
means you're going to get less clicks
but you're going to get higher intent
clicks there's always a push pull

[09:00]
clicks there's always a push pull
happening between friction and the
intent of a potential lead or a customer
so video is cool but you know what's
better long form audio via podcast and
my newsletter TKO pod.com go there to
subscribe for free to my newsletter it's
one email a week very tactical 1500
words per email and then go to my audio
podcast three episodes a week stuff like
this you're going to love it all free no
sleazy sales TKO pod.com if I put
hardly any info in here it will lead to
more leads but those leads will be much
more weak they're going to be less
intent they're not going to want to
spend money with me and I'm going to
spin my wheels and waste my time so put
enough relevant information in there to
trigger all the keywords that people are
searching for and to incentivize someone
to reach out to you to close the sale
but don't put too much in there to where
there's nothing left up to the
imagination now I'm going to show you
what I did with my listing so and kind
of walk you through what I was thinking
as I did it so you'll notice that a lot

[10:01]
as I did it so you'll notice that a lot
of the other listings just said firewood
in the title that is wasted real estate
that's like owning a block of Manhattan
and grazing cows on it it makes no sense
you want to put a skyscraper there take
advantage of it I want to use every
character I can in the title because
those characters are 10 times more
valuable than your description they
don't have to click to read it so I put
cheap firewood free delivery help us
save for college that's the name of the
business college fund firewood I broke
every rule in my naming criteria when I
named it that I usually like to have
short easy to remember easy to spell
three syllable or less uh names but this
I wanted to sell the story in the name
what is the story the fact that I'm
helping two high school kids save money
for college the whole story is told
simply in the three-word name of the
business so if you look at the
description I say exactly what I'm doing
I'm helping two boys at church Devon and

[11:00]
I'm helping two boys at church Devon and
Cade I put the first names in there for
a reason these are real people I'm not
making them up um you can meet them um
start a firewood and barbecue wood
business now I'm not just describing
what I'm doing here these are just
keywords I'm looking for more search
traffic so they can learn about business
and save for college they split and
stack firewood in my backyard and I help
them learn about business I also help
them sell it which is why I'm posting it
here now if I were an orthodontist I
don't want to tell people that I'm I'm
doing it out of my backyard or out of my
house or that I just got my degree
that's a completely different strategy
but this is a home service business
people are good they want to help other
people I want to play on that I want
them to know that they are helping a
real person save for a real education
instead of just another businessman that
I'm competing against and then I say
what the pricing is um and I said you
can buy wood from anyone but don't you
want to support young aspiring American
entrepreneurs free delivery within 30

[12:00]
entrepreneurs free delivery within 30
mil please let me know if you have any
question we can deliver only oak or
pecan if you only need it for barbecue
smoking wood and then the picture I put
in here is a picture of the actual wood
it's not pulled from Google Images this
tells people that we're actually doing
this um and you can see I put a picture
in here of the young men that I'm
helping uh Devon and Cade so they can
see these are real people and when they
come to drop off the firewood they're
going to see these two guys one of the
most UNT marketing channels is also on
Facebook but it's not Marketplace it's
Facebook groups most people have no idea
how many different Niche Facebook groups
there are on a geographic perm Market
basis if you take Plano Texas for
example all I did was search Plano Texas
under groups and I see dozens of groups
Plano Foodies Buy sale trade a Spanish
Plano Group Plano Texas job hunting
these groups are critical because it is
people that live in Plano they're
there's a high likelihood that these

[13:00]
there's a high likelihood that these
people are your future customers the
quality of these groups will depend on
how strict the moderating is the best
thing you can do is join these groups
and start asking engagement bait
questions such as hey I own a tree
triming business and I want to take my
guys out for tacos what are the best
tacos in Plano you'll get a ton of
responses because food is very
opinionated and polarizing or you can go
in there and say hey what are the best
neighborhoods in Plano to raise a family
where are the best neighborhoods for
school districts in Plano what happens
when you ask these questions is that the
Facebook algorithm will eventually it
usually only takes about a week tag your
account as a top contributor and give
you a badge which means after you earn
that Badge Of Trust from Facebook you
can start posting more deliberate salesy
questions such as hey I've been in here
for a little while um thanks for
answering all my questions I own a
firewood business trying to support my
family I'm a school teacher I'm saving

[14:00]
family I'm a school teacher I'm saving
for college whatever your actual story
is tell it and people will want to
support you and the algorithm will
support you because you've already been
adding value to the group without asking
anything in return for the first week or
two
