look at this freaking guy right here
sometimes I see a marketing concept so
brilliant it makes me want to go start a
business just so I can use that
Marketing Concept this guy put flyers
with a QR code all over the city that
says hey I see that you cheated on me I
caught pictures of you right here and
then passers by scan the QR code only to
go to some guy's Instagram page which
honestly is kind of dumb if you think
about it if I were a business owner in
any local area especially one with a
retail business like a restaurant or a
shop I would have that QR code lead to a
discount for appetizers or off clothing
whatever it is that you're selling so
you could drive more traffic to your
business in a way it's like gotcha
marketing it's kind of a bait and switch
cuz they're not getting what they're
expecting to see but at the same time
they're scanning the QR code just to be
entertained and you're still
entertaining them just in a different
way you're entertaining them with a
brilliant Marketing Concept no different
than a Super Bowl ad that everyone loves
