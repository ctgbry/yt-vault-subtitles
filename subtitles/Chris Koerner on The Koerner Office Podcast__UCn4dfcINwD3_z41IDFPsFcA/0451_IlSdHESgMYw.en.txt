this is the most genius side hustle that
I promise you've never heard of so my
buddy right here went to go buy a washer
and dryer from a local Big Box appliance
store and after buying he thought all
right can I just get this delivered I
don't have a truck and they're like no
we don't offer delivery you have to
arrange that yourself so any other
person would have gotten full caring and
be like what how do you sell appliances
not even offer delivery but no he saw
this as an opportunity so he said huh
you don't have anyone delivering for you
I can deliver for you she completely
turned the conversation on its head I'm
like what and he's like yeah how much
would people pay to deliver 150 250
bucks okay so if I rent the trailer and
put on my car well you were refer people
to me that want their appliances
delivered like yeah cuz maybe we could
sell more appliances if you did that so
he did and then he went to the other
appliance store said the same thing sure
then they started calling him every
single day and he would pass the
delivery and installation cost on
directly to the consumer and anytime a
consumer bought a fridge or a washer or
dryer they said hey we can arrange a
delivery and then they would call it my
buddy he was making $300 to $1,000 a
week in net profit making a small
handful of deliveries on the side I've
got the full toolkit right here for free
