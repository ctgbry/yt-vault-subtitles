this is the most profitable RV park I've
ever bought and at the end of this 40c
video I'm going to tell you how you can
find ones this profitable I found this
and the day I saw it I called the guy I
said I want to come see it today I
brought earnest money and a contract I
drove 5 hours out to West Texas I saw it
I shook his hand and I bought it on the
spot it is 16 pad sites $600 a month
rent and it was fully occupied I paid
125 grand for it which is a 40% cap rate
which also means 40% Roi it's the net
operating income divided by the purchase
price I found the sucker on Craigslist
of all places Craigslist and Facebook
Marketplace have the best deals follow
