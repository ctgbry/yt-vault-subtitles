[00:00]
a lot of times if you talk to a guy
that's a tech that's not used to sales
and you talk about commission based on
growth he's going to bristle thinking
that you're asking him to go make cold
calls or start knocking out doors but a
lot of times it's just like a
spontaneous conversation with the
homeowner and all he has to say is
offhand hey do you know anyone else that
needs pool cleaning oh actually it's
like very low pressure but in his mind
in his mind that's not selling right he
just doesn't understand what selling is
welcome back to the ker office I took
four questions today from entrepreneurs
Jake Luis Ashley and Connor Jake owns a
pool cleaning business and he also has a
W2 so he's trying to hire a general
manager to take over his duties but he
doesn't know how to incentivize them so
we talked about sales incentives and
just keeping the business going
incentives and then I spoke with Lou
about his company that helps consumers
find assumable mortgages an assumable

[01:01]
find assumable mortgages an assumable
mortgage being when you buy a property
and you assume the existing hopefully
lower interest rate mortgage as opposed
to getting your own mortgage the third
caller was Ashley and she actually had a
presubmit question about a real estate
deal that she did that she was unhappy
with that was pretty short and then our
last caller Connor he has a million
email addresses of people that have
bought his children's books and he uses
those email addresses to launch
basically farmers markets in hundreds of
markets around the US to teach kids the
value of Entrepreneurship it's a
nonprofit and he wants to know how can I
find more corporate sponsors that will
write $100,000 checks as opposed to high
net worth sponsors that are writing
$20,000 checks kind of an interesting
question and I hope you enjoy it let me
know what you
think Jake all right you asked in your
experience what have you found to be the
best way to source and find Stell gm/
operators and two correctly incentivize
them assuming no so why don't you tell

[02:00]
them assuming no so why don't you tell
me like the business that you're in the
industry that you're in and the specific
problem that you're having around that
question yeah the question I think deres
more from my experience even in the
corporate world the W2 space is that I
found a lack of direct incentives to go
the extra mile I'm starting businesses
and whatnot and and making the leap into
entrepreneurship I've got a pool
cleaning company on the side here that's
doing pretty well and as that grows I'm
looking to hire on staff and whatnot and
I want to take my dissatisfaction with
the the commonplace lack of incentive
and Implement That Into You know my
business and then future businesses that
I start and I think assuming not being
part of the capital stack I was just
curious as to your experience if there's
oneoff incentives that you've placed or
or are found that worked best to make
sure that you and your GM or owner or uh
manager whoever it may be are uh singing
from the same sheet of music as they say
yeah I like it so let's talk more
specifically so you're asking about your

[03:00]
specifically so you're asking about your
pool cleaning business and are you
thinking of hiring your first GM for
that that's correct yes I'm in Michigan
so it's a very seasonal business
obviously and I'm starting to step away
from a full-time W2 and I've actually
worked out a pretty creative solution to
afford myself some more time to start to
grow this more and then start to look to
start other businesses in the uh fall
and winter but yes St answer your
question yeah you're correct yeah why
don't you tell me about what you already
like the idea you already have for this
guy and do you have a person picked out
yet or are you still too early on in the
process do not and candidly I'm still
learning the business and foresee myself
being the owner operator for the the
duration of the summer here really
building up that Client List get a good
foundation and then next year jumpping
off the launch pad so to speak and
hiring out that work and bringing on
some help so now what will the GM be
doing if it's not cleaning pools
directly or is that what he'll be doing
so that's it's a little bit of a crawl
walk around if you will so definitely

[04:00]
walk around if you will so definitely
going to start to clean pools because
I've already got a decent client base
built up and I assume that to to grow
throughout the summer the GM will start
clean pools but as that list grows and
then hiring out techs underneath Etc
that's the plan right now so when you
say GM you mean like a CEO sounds too
formal because it's a small business but
he's going to be in charge of the whole
thing and you're just like checking in
operation operationally wise so like a
CO if if that I guess makes more sense
still heavily involved being myself on
the business side of things being the
CEO and then more or less hiring out the
COO if you will yeah and would you just
be growing the business and doing
marketing is that the type of stuff you
enjoy more yes 100% I'm in the asset
management space over a real estate
family office right now so it's more or
less and and what I really enjoy doing
but want to be doing it for myself okay
yeah do you plan to quit your job for
this uh I'm already starting to I've
actually worked out a solution with them
that I'll be piring back to part-time
and definitely and then so that provides

[05:02]
and definitely and then so that provides
some good cash flow in the interim and
could pay rent and whatnot amongst
ambiguity but yes to to answer your
question I plan on making a a leap of
faith here very surely okay so let's
talk hypotheticals let's say gun to your
head someone approaches you and you have
to hire a GM tomorrow and you have to
incentivize him how do you structure it
today and then maybe I can help you work
with that
logic yeah
so personally I think assuming not
anywhere in the capital stack I would
Implement some sort of a profit sharing
plan with defined hurdles of X growth or
X dollars whatever it may be and that's
on a monthly basis right or a weekly
basis even because the last thing I want
to do is have it evolve into the
traditional year-end review like how did
you do and hope that I give you your
bonus or whatever I want them to take
part in the success of the business on a
dayto day and not have to sit down and
be like oh you did x y and z it's

[06:00]
be like oh you did x y and z it's
defined you accomplished the goals that
we had set out for you and you were
compensated almost instantaneously for
that and so I think a profit sharing
plan is probably what I would do right
now be creative about that so they can
take part in the the success or or
immediate success of the company would
you want them to try to help grow the
company as well ideally sure but for
defining the scope of what I really want
them to do is just drive operations
deliver on a day-to-day basis our Our
Miss and and the provide excellent
customer service and then I can take
more of the role of Outreach growing
marketing to your point it's just that
right now I don't have time to do all
set but yeah to answer a
question if you could choose would you
rather do like a a flat salary plus
commission or all or one of the other of
the two I would rather them have to get
in the game and you are directly
compensated for how hard and how you
work and your success within the company
so commission only specifically I I

[07:01]
so commission only specifically I I
guess ideally yeah but that's might not
be the most attractive if you don't have
true equity in in the company so it
would probably be a hourly or a salary
type ORD deal with additional kicker on
the top and it's just identifying what
that ticker really looks like yeah okay
so I this is a great question I have a
lot of thoughts around incentives and
commissions and flat salary I've noticed
that often times there can be a an
inverse incent so to speak if you are
are look and I know you're not married
to this so don't misunderstand if you
were to seek out someone only for
commission only I feel like a lot of
times that can attract people that you
don't want it's people that maybe don't
have experience they don't have anything
better right so it's no one else will
hire me what do I have to lose here
right y when that does work I feel like
that works best when it's that's what
the industry calls for let's say it's uh
like life insurance and that's industry
standard is to be commissioned only and

[08:00]
standard is to be commissioned only and
maybe you're bringing a book of business
over and you're sharing it
7525 and that's industry standard and
you're just bringing a killer and you're
saying to the killer hey instead of 6040
let's do 50/50 because you're a killer
and he's cool it's commission only but I
know day one I'm going to be making 175
because I'm bringing over what I'm
making 155 on today right right I in my
experience for this type of work what
works best is a a below Market flat
salary and a commission that will get
them above market so let's say I'm just
going to make up numbers let's say
you're doing $110,000 a month Topline
and you know what your margins are and
you can afford to pay a 20% commission
so two grand a month and Market salary
for this is 70 grand so you're going to
pay him 50 Grand and he's oh he knows
that on day one his commission is going
to bring him to 74 Grand or whatever it
is right right yep and so he's like

[09:00]
is right right yep and so he's like
excited and I would always tie growth
into the commission even if you're
planning on doing the growing because
yeah he's out there in the field at
least to start I know he won't be
forever but he's going to develop skills
that he'll be able to pass on to his
field Texs as you guys grow and that
skill might just be saying hi to the
neighbor as he pulls in and then
developing an off-hand conversation with
a neighbor that might turn into another
job a lot of times if you talk to a guy
that's a tech that's not used to sales
and you talk about commission based on
growth he's going to bristle thinking
that you're asking him to go make cold
calls or start knocking out doors but a
lot of times it's just like a
spontaneous conversation with the
homeowner and all he has to say is
offhand hey do you know any anyone else
that needs pool cleaning oh actually
it's like very low pressure but in his
mind that's not selling right he just
doesn't understand what selling is it's
just it's so effective to tie a Tex
Commission to sales and growth because

[10:02]
Commission to sales and growth because
being out there in the Branded shirt in
the WRA truck that's the person that's
most likely to actually close a deal
more so than even you sitting in the
office just because he's out there doing
it I would tie it maybe two different
commission tiers one very conservative
and that's just for keeping going what
you have right Y and it's just like all
right dude we're doing 10 grand a month
I'm going to give you 20% of that and
that's going to get you to 74 which is a
little bit above Market but here's
here's the thing that's only 20% if you
go get the neighbor I'm going to give
you 100% of the first month or of the
first three months because at that point
that your churn is like 4% and that
person's going to stay for years so
whatever and so now in his mind if you
tie the commission to I'm Gonna Give You
5% a month for every month that customer
in business it's like H it's an extra 50
bucks a month but if it's like hey I'm
gonna give you
$400 every time you just mention offand
do you know of anyone else and they say
yes that's 400 bucks that might be what

[11:01]
yes that's 400 bucks that might be what
he's making every week right now right
right and so it all comes down to
framing it and so yeah you always want
to find that balance between um a
structure that can protect you in case
he just goes crazy and start selling a
ton and you find yourself broke and a
structure that's generous and simple
because it's really easy to be like man
keep it simple but simple can really
screw you if he does nothing or does too
much right and it's Al really easy to
say all right here's what you got to do
you got to do earnout over time it's got
to tear down to a
threshold you just have to find that
yeah yeah too much friction you're
asking the right question because most
people aren't thinking of incentives at
all they're like oh Market 70k I'm gonna
pay him 70k commissions are everything
or sorry incentives are everything
Charlie Munger always talks about it if
you're not thinking about incentives
right now even if you think about
incentives all day you're not thinking
about it enough yeah and it's
interesting I guess it's just a forun of
my mind especially as I start businesses

[12:01]
my mind especially as I start businesses
and I start growing these businesses to
where I might be disconnected from or
very disconnected from the day-to-day
operations and to instill or be able to
sleep at night that your brand is being
represented well and they have reason to
represent the brand well and what not I
think is the upmost Precedence to be
honest with you and I know I'm not the
only one who thinks about why am I not
getting paid extra for working on the
weekend or Etc whatever you may have it
in the W2 space especially but yeah so
have you had I guess as a followup or
the first part of the question it's very
broad stroke but the the sourcing and
finding of Stellar guys or or girls that
you found or or Outlets or the vetting
process as a whole I don't just any
experience of finding the the studs out
there yeah honestly the the most luck
we've had in finding this type of
position has been indeed like it's very
it's like right in front of your face
I'm not telling you anything youone
already know but paying for indeed

[13:00]
already know but paying for indeed
there's the free version and the paid
version allocating four to 500 bucks to
applications and then just making it a
numbers game you're GNA you're going to
come across good guys also I would just
drive around your area and when you see
any sort of a a crew like a tree crew or
lawn or whatever I would just pull over
and talk to them like hey man like what
do you guys oh okay and just fake like
you're just a curious but very friendly
homeowner and then start like how long
have you been working this job oh okay
oh seven years okay seven years means
he's probably really good at this okay
and just like those unscalable things
and you already said this yourself are
often lead to the best people right for
sure yeah but otherwise indeed works
great so yeah cool can't thank you can't
thank you enough for for having me on
here and responding to a hell of a cold
DM there but now you're you're a
rockstar and you're inspiring uh a lot
of people out there including myself
can't thank you enough and I appreciate
your time today yeah thank you Jake have

[14:02]
your time today yeah thank you Jake have
a good day you as well take care see
you
Lou so you have a platform that enables
people to find assumable mortgages and
from what I understand an assumable
mortgage is when you buy a property and
you just assume that existing mortgage
which today the big benefit of that is
not having to pay 7 to % interest rates
you can hopefully capture their 3 to 5%
interest R is that
right yeah we've actually been struck by
how low some of the interest rates are
we have a home in Nashville that we have
a VA loan on that one's like 2.25 and
it's something it's some crazy number
it's something like 70% are under 4%
interest rate so you're talking about
potentially up to$ thousand dollars or
more savings on a per month basis and
then over the life of the loan hundreds
of thousands certainly okay so where is
your business at right now are you guys
pre-revenue post- Revenue where are you
in your journey we have generated a

[15:01]
in your journey we have generated a
pretty remarkable amount of leads
probably pushed 30,000 leads to our real
estate partners and they're the ones
making those referrals to the local real
estate folks to actually help those
people the thing about uh consumable
mortgages is a little different from a
typical transaction you go through many
of the same like underwriting processes
just servicers who are actually like
collecting funds every month on those
mortgages they don't move very quick and
this week announced that servicers could
charge up to $1,800 per you know
transaction and from the folks that
we've been talking to in across
servicers they're all trending downwards
and so most of them are around maybe 60
days now getting back getting down
towards 45 and even faster now what is
60 days
exactly that's like basically from the
time that the person engages with the
serer to get the loan moved over from
the seller to the buyer's name okay so
first tell me how your platform works so
when you say you drove leads to your
real estate partners and all that like
how does it work
yeah we have the right now the only

[16:01]
yeah we have the right now the only
Nationwide platform where folks can go
into whatever their local area is they
click on a property they find one they
like that makes sense for their
financial situation they click assume
this home at that point we've got real
quick are these properties for sale yeah
go ahead are they for sale or are they
just homes that exist that have an
assumable mortgage homes that are listed
for sale and so they click on that we
have it all Zapped up in the back end
and they get reached out to from our
folks who get the particular their
situation
Cate that with the information that
we've already collected from them as far
as like down payment you know that
they're capable of providing and then
that gets pushed off to an agent in
their local area that we've already had
a conversation with we've already
provided them resources and details
about how these transactions are you
know supposed to go and then yeah and
then they run with it okay so if I'm a
consumer and I want to buy a home with
an assumable mortgage I'm going to go to
your website I'm going to search in my
area I'm going to see one and I've got
it pulled up now so I can see oh that's
a nice house oh 5. 4% okay nice you

[17:00]
a nice house oh 5. 4% okay nice you
click on it and you purposely can't see
really the details of the house yet
right this is like a totally bootstrap
thing me and my buddy like late last
summer we started like thinking about
this and working on it and the the thing
is like getting at this data is like
very difficult it's not impossible you
can do it like local real estate agents
but it's timec consuming take you a
couple minutes to look up each property
rather than being able to see like a
full view I assume that was for a reason
I'm not criticizing that strategy I'm
just trying to fully understand how it
works because I have it pulled up now as
if I'm a consumer so you click assume
this home and that is basically a
consumer telling you that they want to
learn more about the home and then
they're led to a type form right and
they put in their info and I'm doing
this now so you're going to see a lead
from me um just trying to see how it
works I'm a buyer do I have a real
estate agent so if the answer is yes
what does that do are you generating
Revenue by just referring leads to real
estate agent for a percentage of their
Commission
it is the case that like certain people

[18:01]
it is the case that like certain people
have come in and they're like I already
have an agent and we're like okay yeah
sure no problem hey if at any point once
you guys are under contract on that
particular home go Ahad and give us a
call there's also a page on our website
if you want to do like the Assumption
management it's right up there on the
services toab okay so if I don't have an
agent then you're sending that to an
agent and what if I do have an
agent if you do have an agent like
that's fine or whatever at that point if
it's not agent that we previously work
with we're like hey if you guys have any
questions we're the whole point of we
started this making money was like a
secondary consideration we're like let's
make this information like out let's get
this information out there information
wants to be free and but if you already
have one we're like okay great at that
point now the particulars that property
and you have the information to go to
that seller and say hey I noticed that
this this mortgage is assumable I love
to do that and then if you guys you
found value from their website or what
then they could come back engage us for
the assumption and then we also get paid

[19:00]
the assumption and then we also get paid
on that okay okay so back to the data
fidelity thing tell me if this is wrong
the reason that I can't see the info
when I click assume this home it's
because you've got to go fetch that info
right yeah it's about having the data
provider that can actually give you all
that information and you make trade-offs
in terms of do you want to spend I I
don't know if you've looked at like
buying data from like a core logic or
something like that but it's it gets
like very expensive very quickly yeah
okay so once again consumer submits a
lead you get going on the back end do
you get going at reaching out to the
consumer or to a realtor in that area
first yeah so they make they make
contact with the with the consumer
confirm all the details and then they
make a warm hand off to that agent who's
going to be Downstream okay okay have
you thought about shortening the the
cycle of generating a or of getting that
lead with in type form of just like
getting their first name and phone or
first name email and phone yeah we've
tried a a few different things my my

[20:01]
tried a a few different things my my
co-founder is a a marketer by trade and
he's always testing these different
things we're thinking of about like
Downstream ways that we can like help
agents become you know a little bit more
informed so that it's so that they can
manage expectations for their buyers and
their sellers more appropriately and
serve them in a better way to make the
transaction more likely to be successful
okay
so can you explain that in a more simple
way your bottleneck specifically is
getting the transactions done
because assuma bles haven't been a thing
since basically like the 80s yeah and
everyone who has done them has more or
less aged out like they they get
processed from time to time I think like
the numbers for the last two years were
something like 3, 3600 something like
that they're not big numbers in the past
because it just hasn't been something
that has been something that's super
valuable to do and now that it is and
both on the buy and the sell side right
like buyer's going to be able to afford
more home because the payment's not
going to be crushing them and then the
seller depending on on how you think
about it with rates having risen as much

[21:01]
about it with rates having risen as much
as they have like prices on Helms should
be down significantly more than they are
but like you have all these Supply
constraints right and so sellers don't
want to give up on getting the number
that they see on those estimate yeah and
so the assuma is are a way to get it
done but it's like slightly more
complicated and people just aren't super
comfortable advising their clients on it
and so that's the big thing I think that
we've been running into kind of
education to the Realtors so they can
educate their clients in an accurate way
about how it
works 100% yeah do you have any stories
of how this is Illustrated perfectly
like all right we had this one client we
had a realtor and it just fell apart
because of X Y and Z all the agents that
we've gotten feedback from they're like
awesome lead quality because we have
that little bit longer lead form we
collect that information like down
payment the thing that we're hearing
about from Agents is how quickly these
transactions can happen so they're like
this is going to take 6 months it's like
like 60 days so there's a dichotomy the
realtor are like wow this is a great
thank you so much but also I don't know

[22:01]
thank you so much but also I don't know
what to do with this and I is this a
scam like they don't even know enough
about assuma to really sell it to their
client we provided them with a lot of
material we have lending Partners who
are going to be able to lend in that
second position to make that down
payment not so big the problem that
we're running into is that these listing
agents like just don't get it yet and
they frankly don't realize like what an
asset they're sitting on from like a
listing perspective like it's a total
differentiator and it makes it stand out
we're running up against right now is is
trying to help listing agents understand
that okay so the buyer agents are are
fine they're on board with it but
they're trying to convince the listing
agent that what they have is different
and unique and so they should basically
consider their offer more than a a
competing
offer sure yeah okay now how long have
you been at this like how old is the
oldest good lead that you've received
and what happened to those so
yeah so we we launched the platform

[23:00]
yeah so we we launched the platform
February 5th we've had uh a handful of
of these leads like actually go through
like conventional transactions and we're
still fighting to get that same kind of
uptake on the assemblable side did you
not get paid on the conventional
transactions it's so it's a master
listing agreement that our real estate
Partners sign with it so it's basically
however or Master referral agreement so
however that transaction gets done our
real estate Partners get paid on it and
then we would get paid as well but have
you gotten paid on a completed
transaction even if it wasn't
assumable yeah yeah okay so what you're
seeing is because of this friction and
confusion between the listing agent and
the the buyer agent a lot of these are
either just falling off or they're just
closing a traditional mortgage and not
using your platform
right yeah right that's yeah does it
make a difference to you if they get a
traditional mortgage as far as revenue
is concerned no once at some point right
if they once like the lending product is
fully baked in we'll be able to get like

[24:01]
fully baked in we'll be able to get like
points on that or referrals from that
and if they go out and get like brand
new lending then that's a conversation
to have too how much revenue are you
receiving on average for deals that
you've closed it's like in the like
single digit thousands yeah low single
digit thousands so it's predicated right
onage of their
commission yeah right sure let me ask
you this does it matter does it matter
that they're getting traditional
mortgages and that there's this friction
in the education proc process or is this
kind of an ethical bait and switch where
people come to your website wanting an
assumable mortgage you match him with a
realtor they're wanting an assumable
mortgage and because of some idiot
listing agent they're not able to get
that assumable mortgage by no fault of
yours but they still get a mortgage and
you still get paid is that too
simplistic like it's certainly could be
the case the whole reason we started
this was to try to help people have you
made like a 60-second video explaining
how it works like just very simply have
you ever done that yeah we we have yeah

[25:02]
you ever done that yeah we we have yeah
and I I answer all of the emails that
that come through we get agents reaching
out to us we get consumers reaching out
to us folks who want to partner with us
on on this or that portion of the
business that's why I suggested a video
right like I feel like if you were to
make a very Tik Tock style short like a
literal short that's not really you you
could post it but that's not the purpose
the purpose is to ask the the agent that
you're referring to to send it to the
listing agent like right away and some
sort sort of a call to action and then
some sort of an automated zapier
followup where you're asking the agent
incessantly did you send the video did
you send the video and maybe a tracking
system where you can make sure that the
video is watched right I I look at this
like I look at my mining Syndicate where
we sell Bitcoin miners our biggest
competition is education and convincing
people that we're not a scam and the
only way that we've been over able to
overcome that is very unscalable and
that's hopping like giving physical
tours which is not relevant for you and

[26:01]
tours which is not relevant for you and
hopping on zooms with people and then
once we do that the close rate is 80%
and we can get like yeah 90% of the way
to that 80% if we just do a webinar and
that's in in a way that's even more
social proof because they see other
people in the webinar and their strength
and numbers and so depending on your
lead volume you could even do this have
you ever heard of webinars that are
they're not live like they appear live
but they're
not yeah just ASN like an async webinar
you could have a daily one that these
Realtors join at any given time and they
can see like a live count of everyone
who's ever been in it asking questions
and whatnot maybe even have someone on
the back end answering those in real
time and I just I feel like you need to
give them a packet with different
multimedia formats right like from least
to most friction and also from least
tactical to most tactical and so it's
like back to my mind mining Syndicate
example we recently had this huge

[27:01]
example we recently had this huge
conversion of platforms and it was a big
deal and I AB tested the emails that we
sent out and one email explained
everything we were doing in detail and
the other one just said three sended
like we're switching platforms let us
know if you have any questions here's a
blog post and the blog post was
basically a copy paste of that long
email and 90% of people just they
weren't ever going to read the blog post
they didn't want to they didn't care
they just wanted to know the tldr of it
and so I I would just have a welcome
packet with 30 second video first and
then maybe a 3 minute video second with
even more detail and then maybe like a
link to the webinar and then maybe a
link to the FAQs and just set up a ton
of zapier automations to the listing
agent or to the Buyer Agents where
you're just pestering them to death hey
did you send it did you send it or just
get the buyer agent info and you just
send it directly to them I know this
sounds like a scam but it was really
popular in the 70s but we have had low
rates for a long time so it doesn't make
sense but now it actually does make
sense a lot of people don't think it's
possible but it is possible it's

[28:00]
possible but it is possible it's
actually life Chang you could save
$1,000 a month go through all that and
they just push that packet on them to no
end with like tracking all over that so
then you can start to see all right
everyone's clicking on the fourth option
even though we thought they'd all click
on the video let's put the fourth option
to the top it reminds me of Link tree
where I have a link Tree on Twitter and
I'm like all right I want everyone to go
to my personal website first and then
I'll put co-founders decom fifth and
then after a month I can see man Even
though co-founders decom is fifth
they're all clicking on that so I'm just
going to make it easier for them I'm
going to put that first right you're
just you're throwing a lot at them and
then letting the data speak for itself
and adjusting accordingly it's hard to
give advice of like how you can educate
someone that's two degrees of separation
away from you all I can do is relate to
my own experiences and companies like
uber and Airbnb that sounded like a scam
at first and the only way Airbnb really
fix that is just by time and letting it

[29:01]
fix that is just by time and letting it
become more acceptable and removing
friction and just doing the type of
stuff that we're talking about
now that Mak sense gotcha yeah no it's
it's it's an interesting yeah that's an
interesting take we considered okay I
hope it's helpful it seems like you're
doing something awesome so I'd love to
hear uh a followup of how it
goes yeah for sure I would love to come
back on six months hence and have close
a lot more transactions for folks yeah I
would love that as well all right man
all right brother man cheers thanks
appreciate it thanks for calling see you
here is a question from Ashley I sold an
investment property one unit in a 20
unit complex to a developer through an
18-month long sales process where all
owners had to agree to sell to the
developer that sounds like a nightmare I
was initially very happy with the price
I got doubled my money in 5 years until
I found out the prices that others
receed received I was not the lowest but

[30:00]
receed received I was not the lowest but
the highest prices were 250k more this
is a substantial percentage difference
as all prices were under 1 million I
know that comparison is a thief of Joy I
hate that quote by the way and I should
move on and learn from this experience
but I'm struggling to get past it the
question is how to emotionally move past
this I understand all the logical
reasons I can't change the past still
made a good profit I can learn to
negotiate better Etc but it's getting
past the missed opportunity mindset how
would you handle this situation Ashley I
feel for you I've been there I have
seemingly I'm quot quoting right now
wasted months and years of my life at
opportunities that didn't pan out i'
I've been there and it's especially
maddening like you would be happier
today had you not learned that fact you
can't change it but you would be happier
right that's why you're riding
in I would suggest you develop a chip on
your shoulder
and I don't know how to tell you to move

[31:00]
and I don't know how to tell you to move
past it other
than make that fuel you
to at least make up for that amount of
money that you feel that you missed out
on with a future real estate deal right
that's the tuition that you paid to
learn more about negotiating with
developers and or with other
tenants for me when I had something
terrible like this
happen the only thing that fixed it was
finding more success success is the best
revenge right and then it ended up being
I became more successful than the person
that had wronged me and then it really
became easy had that never happened
being real with you right now I'd still
be struggling I'd still be angry I wish
I could just tell you that I just forced
my way through it and I I moved past it
and moved on but I didn't so I think you
just need to put your head down and
focus on making a lot of money at
whatever brings you a lot of joy and
attach that success to this moment in

[32:02]
attach that success to this moment in
your life where you felt wrong I say
this every now and then but everyone is
insecure right I'm insecure Steve Jobs
is insecure everyone's insecure about
something the difference is do you know
what you're insecure about do you have
the self-awareness of what is making you
angry or what is making you feel
uncomfortable or or not confident right
if you have a self-awareness about your
insecurities or about the chips on your
shoulders then you will be significantly
more successful and more happy in the
long run so you clearly do have some
level of self-awareness because you're
asking me I just suggest that you just
keep crushing it and keep trying to make
money and buy real estate and start
businesses and it will come but it can
take
time Connor B hello
sir all right let me go ahead and pull
up your
question you asked how can we attract
major corporate sponsors 100K Plus for
our National Youth entrepreneur
preneurship program yes I remember
looking at your website and I was very

[33:01]
looking at your website and I was very
impressed with it and so I would like to
hear about your business and then about
your
question sounds good so this is called
the children's entrepreneur Market it is
a series of Saturday morning largely
activities think of these like lemonade
stands on steroids or like a farmers
market where it's run entirely by the
kids so Mom and Dad can help set up and
take down the booth but the kids run the
whole show and so not only are we giving
kids an opportunity to learn about
marketing and money and customer service
and how to pitch and how to close and
and all that uh we're really empowering
them through the profit motive to get
them excited about earning money but use
that as a way to teach about the
principles of free enterprise and get
them to become future little
entrepreneurs and capitalists the
schools aren't doing this parents will
sometimes do a short little Lemonade
Stand but 90% of the time the kids just
sit there waiting for cars to stop so at
our Market events we do a lot of
advertising bring out a lot of foot
traffic so that these kids are not only
selling but they're learning a lot
through the interaction so we're scaling

[34:01]
through the interaction so we're scaling
it nationally we're in 26 States we'll
be fully National within the next two
years and so to sustain this it's a
nonprofit but to sustain this for the
future we really want to develop uh a
range of corporate sponsorships to get a
lot of we think as a national brand and
as a way to give back and support these
community events it could be a good
strategy I love it first of all thank
you for explaining that so succinctly
that's greatly appreciated I think
everyone listening and that will be
listening is able to understand
immediately what you do so you basically
organize farmers markets around the
country and soon around the globe for
kids to sell their stuff to teach them
capitalism entrepreneurship are you able
to speak about your like your numbers
your Revenue numbers I know you're
nonprofit but I'd like to dig into how
you make
money yes this has been what I I call a
philanthropic Kickstart model so we go
out to donors and we get them to help us
launch in Austin Texas or Orlando
Florida or wherever it is and and with

[35:01]
Florida or wherever it is and and with
that Capital we hire someone locally in
that metro area who is our market
manager to launch all these events we
start setting up events and then we
attract people we have booth fees that
are $20 a pop just so the kids have a
little skin in the game and so we
develop a little bit of Revenue that way
we sell t-shirts for the kids that say
I'm an entrepreneur and have some
corporate logos on the back for our
sponsors like a 5k type of thing so we
have those two revenue streams which are
are minor those aren't going to generate
enough sufficient to defay all the costs
that go into operating this program and
so the philanthropy at the beginning is
100% but the idea is to taper it down to
no more than 20 or 30% of the overall
budget both through the booth fees and
the shirt sales but then largely through
the corporate sponsorships where we're
going to be able to I think generate far
more Revenue than we're getting from the
booth fees and the shirts okay so I'm
going to pick a random City and I want
you to talk me through what launching in
that City would look like so are you in
sou Falls
we're not yet all right so you want to

[36:00]
we're not yet all right so you want to
go to sou Falls and what does that look
like what what do you do who do you call
how much money do you ask for and what
usually happens we are focused on
launching in the top 200 Metro areas
around the country and So within any
given metropolitan area we'll launch a
bunch of markets each year 10 to 20 or
more and we'll first go to donors in
that community and say hey help us bring
this to your city and and try and find
that philanthropic support once we find
some seed capital we have a network I
write a series of books called the
Tuttle twins so these are books that
help their help kids learn about the
ideas of freedom and we have a large
national network a million families so
we'll go to somewhere like CU Falls and
we'll create a segment in our email list
and say hey guys we're launching this
project in your city would you like to
be a part of it and from that network of
people who already know us love us trust
us we're able to find our market manager
people who are really excited by the
opportunity to work with our
organization so we'll hire the market
manager he or she largely she will begin

[37:00]
manager he or she largely she will begin
developing relationships with the cities
and the community organizations the key
for us for growth is to launch our
markets not just on a random in a park
or on a sidewalk but we attach our
events with large let's say City
festivals and rodeos and other big
events where there's already 5 10 15,000
people coming and so we can piggyback on
those events and generate a ton of foot
traffic um and so our market manager
builds those relationships and plans all
those markets and then actually on the
day of is there to just administer the
whole thing and operate the whole
program all of them ACR across the
country are supported by a very small
national team including our corporate
sponsorship sales guy that we just hired
who's our fundraiser out to try and
attract some of the support to sustain
the broader National program so how much
money would you be looking for in in sou
Falls so in each in the metro area
itself it's typically around H 100,000 a
year for each metro area that we operate
in okay and that's to support 10 to 15
events that's correct okay how are you

[38:02]
events that's correct okay how are you
finding donors to to raise that money
from just through your email list a lot
of our locations that we launch in are
aspirational and and not already covered
what I mean by that is we'll have
someone who donates in our national
program without regard to a particular
location we'll use that Capital to go
into strategic places in Austin there's
a lot of freedom-- minded capitalists or
LA or Palm Beach and so we'll launch in
some of these places just to give us a
little bit of Toe Hold so that we can
then go in and start talking to some
potential donors in that area but a lot
of this is with our Tuttle twins books
it's a well-known brand people around
the country know it and so that's
allowed us to open up conversations with
donors in all these different places and
and what I like most about this project
is the hyper locality of it the fact
that I can go to someone in Boston and
say help us bring this to your kids or
grandkids in your backyard they will
specifically benefit from it it makes it
a little bit EAS easier to solicit
donations as opposed to this broad

[39:00]
donations as opposed to this broad
generic more personal aspect to it
exactly okay and how much does an
average donor contribute I'd say the
average donor is probably around a 20
grand a lot of our donors are
entrepreneurs and uh business owners who
can write larger checks and so we get
some that skew very large and a lot of
people will donate 10 2050 but what
we're really after are the people who
can drive enough Revenue our way to
allow us to launch this without us
having to spend a lot of time chasing
Small Checks yeah
what is the biggest check you've ever
gotten and how did that
come uh million dollars and that came
organically someone saw one of our
Tuttle twins ads and reached out to a
friend to say hey do you know what this
is and he said yeah I know Connor
actually and introduced us and so we
built a relationship and over time they
became our our biggest
owner
um how much effort do you put into
asking for more money from your current
donors vers finding new
donors a lot yeah we're scaling up our

[40:02]
donors a lot yeah we're scaling up our
fundraising team right now and that's a
big part of it is to ask people to grow
with us but the same amount of energy we
can put into someone who let's say
donated 50 Grand and to get them to go
to 75 or 100 some of that that energy if
we apply it to finding new donors can
often yield much larger gifts if we
spend our time focused on the very high
net worth business owners who get really
excited about entrepreneurship and
capitalism and they see that the schools
aren't uh doing a good job with this at
all and they want to help stem the tide
and push back on that degrading culture
so a lot of our time is really focused
on meeting and and cultivating
relationships with these very high net
worth individuals who are aligned with
our values have you ever taken the time
to scrape like a public database of of
donors whether political donors or
otherwise we've done that years ago with
political donors a lot of nonprofits
struggle with that just because
political donors end up being somewhat
of a different animal than than let's
say policy donors people who are trying

[41:01]
say policy donors people who are trying
to affect long-term change so where
we've struggled and and other
organizations like us in the past is
that political donors tend to be very
fear-based uh and very reactive hey
donate $50 today to make sure the other
guy loses as opposed to this
aspirational
Visionary uh type of approach so the
short answer is yes but very mixed and
and often poor results I guess I didn't
mean like specifically scraping a
political a list of political donors but
rather finding organizations or
databases where the this type of donor
is made public right like I'm thinking
like a children's museum that has a a
page on their website dedicated to all
of their donors right having a VA go in
and scrape all those maybe it's just
first and last name maybe it's just the
Jones family and taking that database
and trying to append the data with uh
address email phone number have you ever
tried that um so we've done that only
for corporate sponsorships so we'll go

[42:00]
for corporate sponsorships so we'll go
to let's say an organization like Junior
Achievement or something like that and
and they'll list who their major
corporate sponsors are so that that
gives us a signal as to hey here's a
business that at least in one case
supports youth learning financial
literacy and learning about this and so
that's how we developed our first kind
of Base list of what type of
corporations that we're going to try and
go after and approach I haven't really
done it for the individual donors in our
experience a lot of nonprofits keep that
confidential and there's just not a lot
of data out there um that you can get
for example our own nonprofit We Don't
disclose our doners and so no one would
be able to obtain that data um and so
oftentimes you'll it's it's either
corporations or foundations which are
required to be public in their
disclosure about donating and so those
are both ways that we've been able to
try and cultivate those lists and go
after new people okay let me ask a
totally different type of question do
you have any data on how much re flows
through an average Market through the

[43:00]
through an average Market through the
kids so the average kid earns I think
it's around $150 right now in a
three-hour market and so typically we
get 60 to 100 kids depending and so
whatever that that math is n Grand yeah
10 grand something that okay and then
how many markets per year we are in the
process of scaling right now just
started last year this year we will do
about 340 markets around the the country
and within 5 years that'll be up to
2,000 but right now it's 340 markets so
that's 3.4 million if we're saying about
10 grand per market and then
realistically how much do you think
you'll raise this year not like what
your goal is but what do you think
you'll end up raising does this include
corporate sponsorships or just from the
philanthropic donors directly including
everything everything all together
probably I'd say
million and a half if I just had to
think off top of my head okay and so

[44:02]
think off top of my head okay and so
your the original reason that you wrote
in was you're trying to find more 100K
sponsors right because you're you're
chasing $20,000 checks and you think
100K it would just be more efficient
right very specifically the question is
to attract the corporate sponsors I we
have a good strategy with the individual
donors the foundations we've got a good
thing going there what's new for us is
trying to package this in a way that's
very interesting uh to the corporate
givers who are giving to the junior
achievements and others as well trying
to find the right way to to present what
we're doing in a way that would be
attractive to corporate corporations
specifically what is the title of
someone at a corporation that might be
the decision maker for something like
this a lot of times it's uh the kind of
the marketing team a lot of
organizations have a corporate social
responsibility type of uh person I think
I think my team has created that list of
job titles so I'm shooting from the hip

[45:01]
job titles so I'm shooting from the hip
but community outreach is another one I
know we often see some companies will
have a community outreach team or at
least one person on it so those are some
of the the top of Mind ones and how what
type of Outreach have you done to these
job titles so far for now it's just been
we're in early stages for this so it's
just been a lot of LinkedIn Outreach and
creating DM workflows and trying to use
hunter.io to find email address pattern
and then reach out to them and just
build a sequence where we're then
following up and trying to cultivate
them and has that been fruitful at
all like I said early stages we've got
some good conversations going but not
specifically any major corporate gifts
yet okay and earlier you mentioned you
had a million people is that is that a
million email addresses or what does
that data look like those are email
addresses so Nationwide about a million
and spread across the country so these
are people who have bought our Tuttle
twins books
or engaged with our content in exchange
for an email address and mostly it's the

[46:02]
for an email address and mostly it's the
moms getting this stuff on behalf of
their kids so it's basically a million
unique households is is how we see it
and how often are you emailing everyone
on that
list oh twice a week okay what are your
open and click rates open rates are like
55% and click rates I think are pretty
low because primarily when we're
emailing people twice a week it's more
newsletter not boring corporate
newsletter content but it's talking
about current events and just keeping a
strong relationship for when we do have
a big sale of our books or something
more specifically like that so just
creating a lot of content and value in
the relationship and informing them so
not every email is designed to get
people to click got so I I think it's
like a i two to four% somewhere around
there for the click rate and of of all
the emails you send let's say you send
100 a year what percentage of those are
talking about fundraising or asking for
fundraising or talking about your

[47:00]
fundraising or talking about your
markets versus talking about your books
so
95% of the emails are talking about the
books and the ideas in the books we only
occasionally sprinkle in any fundraising
appeals directly to this this audience
okay so very rarely do you talk about
fundraising now do you ever talk about
markets that you're hosting but not
fundraising to the list so we'll send
targeted emails yeah so we won't blast
the whole list but we'll when we're
ready to launch and see who falls right
we'd have that segment and then we'd go
back out to them and say hey guys we're
ready to launch here's how you can sign
up your kids here's how you can support
what we're doing so yeah we'll do the
kind of segmented emails to the
particular people in that region and
what software are you using for
email clavo nice I love it how
granularly are you segmenting based off
of zip
code okay so we'll do like within 30 40
miles of the core location that we're

[48:00]
miles of the core location that we're
focused on and so whoever Falls in that
area and then do you have how much data
do you have on each email
address we haven't done any kind of
external appending and any other data
services like that beyond what they've
given us and so typically it's hey
here's my shipping address for the books
and so then we get their mailing address
their phone number their email and
that's basically it we do ask it check
out like the ages of their kids as an
option question just so we can segment
on that but typically it's just their
location information okay so I love
clavio I love email marketing I love
that you love it it seems a million
emails is a ton I don't even want to
know what your clavo bill is what is
your clavo bill I have to know I don't
know but I remember I looked like last
year and it was a lot of money oh yeah I
yeah I pay thousands and my list isn't
anywhere near that that big I would
segment your data even more I would try
to append it I would also
put your emails in a spreadsheet and

[49:00]
put your emails in a spreadsheet and
separate out the domains so basically
pull out all of the yahoos and the Gils
find all the corporate domains and try
to find which emails is a work email and
then I would take those far away from
clavio and use something like lemlist or
gmass to send hundreds of emails not
Millions hundreds at a time from like an
email address like maybe your personal
email email address using a a something
like gmass where you can plug in their
first name you can plug in as much
personalized data as you want and say
Carla I see that you work for Coca-Cola
the ttle twins you're on our email list
I'm just very curious this is what we do
we we raise money for this program these
program this program changes lives do
you know anyone at Coca-Cola or know
anyone that might know someone that I
could talk to about corporate
sponsorship I would start with that and
start the referral ball going from
people that are already seeing your
emails in their inbox what do you think

[50:01]
emails in their inbox what do you think
about
that yeah I like that idea promps a
question in terms of data appending do
you have any particular companies or
services that you like or recommend that
do that we haven't done that yet I just
did this like a month ago oh man let me
see if it's it like pops up in my
browser put you on the spot I know I
just remember the website was green
that's not helping you at all but I can
picture the website I will say that the
prices are all over the map on that and
I was able to find one that was
reasonable and cheap if I find it I will
put it in the show notes and I will
email it to you as well it's there's
probably an email in my inbox but I
remember it was like 70 to 80% cheaper
this is what I did I found four and I
uploaded the same list to all of them
and the one that was like 70% cheaper
was just as good if not better than the
others so let me see if I can find it
and I'll send it to you but if if I
don't find find it just keep looking
until you find one that's drastically
cheaper and test test it again yeah in

[51:02]
cheaper and test test it again yeah in
green and test the same list against a
few of them to see which one works best
I like it yeah because those services
are really good it'll tell you their the
LinkedIn URL of their profile I just
feel like with a million people you have
such an advantage and you can even take
that list do you do any paid ads
Facebook or Google oh yeah yeah quite
have you done lookalike audiences based
on that list have you done ads for
corporate sponsors at all not for
corporate sponsorships we haven't no our
ads are all centered around getting
people to buy our books so we haven't
done ads for the corporate I would try
that on LinkedIn specifically upload
your email list to LinkedIn and make a
lookalike audience I don't think it's
called lookalike on LinkedIn but make
the equivalent of a lookalike audience
on LinkedIn for people uh with that job
title I would try paid ads for corporate
sponsorships for people you don't even
need to make it look like audience just
upload the million people and make an an
actual audience out of that and send the
or push the paid ads towards them at the

[52:01]
or push the paid ads towards them at the
same time that you're sending these
emails so hopefully some people can see
both around the same time frame it's a
great idea fun fun idea that I'll get
working on I like it I appreciate it
absolutely let me know if it actually
works for you and if it doesn't let's
chat some more
ideas awesome okay appreciate it Chris
yeah thank you Connor thanks see you bye
all right we're done hope you likeed
that four very different questions
please like And subscribe subscribe and
we will see you next time
