look at this freaking thing right here
so this seems like a dumb idea on the
surface I will admit but the more I
thought about it the more I loved it
this is day 12 of showing you 202's best
business ideas so follow for more here's
why you can roll up at conferences CES
Consumer Electronic Show with limited
edition books and cool trinkets put on
your retrofitted car or truck pull up
outside the conference where people are
walking in and out and sell the heck out
of what she does here is she has romance
novels on this pink car and she rolls up
to parties and events and sells them to
women in Knoxville Tennessee who would
have thought that's a thing she's
crushing it she's crushing it because
anytime you have a unique vending
concept or food truck you automatically
turn heads it's cool it's different it's
Unique that gives you an advantage
regardless of what you're selling so
copy and paste the same concept with
other types of books or limited edition
books or board games or what have you
because the more we're online the more
we want to be offline and touch and hold
physical things so get the full business
plan for this right here
