look at this freaking thing right here I
just heard about a guy here in the
states that saw this exact video learned
that these things weren't being sold
here in America and figured out a way to
do it but before I get to that here's
what this actually is this is an
Argentine fire pit and they're made and
sold only in Argentina and there's eight
times as many people in the United
States as in Argentina and we're meat
obsessed just like they are so this guy
thought if that sells well there that
would sell well here so he took this
ugly website through it up sent it to
friends and family commissioned a welder
to start making prototypes and started
getting orders he didn't ask for
permission you can just do things his
thesis is we had the Big Green Egg we
had trer pet grills we had pizza ovens
what's the next big outdoor grill could
it be this I don't know but I admire
entrepreneurship and people that take
big bets on themselves by the way this
is that ugly website follow me for more
business content like this
