[00:00]
okay you're going to like today instead
of talking about business ideas you
could start we talked about really cool
business ideas that we found that you
could copy one is like a very Niche
content site it's called view from your
seat where people take pictures of where
they're sitting in a stadium it's old
school it's low Tech but it just prints
out money and then we talked about a
custom signature business industry it's
random I know but we talked about how we
could copy this growth hacking sending
someone's custom signature to them via
cold email to the type of person that
would buy a custom signature it's weird
I would never pay for this but people do
you're going to love it Sam's great
we'll have them on again like subscribe
share we'll see you next
[Music]
time I got a dumb idea for you and I
want you to make it good you ready for
it I'm ready dude this has been in my
business ideas list for years so I went
to Idaho a few years ago I was paddle
boarding you ever go paddle boarding
yeah so I think it's pretty boring once
I went paddle boarding in a lake in
Alabama that alligator in it and it was

[01:00]
Alabama that alligator in it and it was
terrifying yeah that's a hard pass I was
yeah hard pass I was paddle boarding in
like a slow moving River in Idaho and it
was a lot of fun because you're moving
naturally right and one thing I noticed
was when I opened up my arms and the
breeze came it I acted like a sail okay
sick and it pushed me faster like oh
physics cool I'm going full marar Rober
over here right yeah yeah yeah and so
like is there a world where you could
build a stupid
sale a physical sale that you clip on
your back or something that just helps
you like you don't need to be in a river
most paddle borders are are in sing
water right you go out on a lake and you
can still paddle you still get as much
of a workout in as you want but you got
a little boost to make you go faster
make it more fun what do you think dude
I'm not mad you have you seen the the
Skydive suits the squirrel the squirrel
Skydive suits yep it'd be a variation on
that dude M and I think you could I love
this I think that you could get away

[02:00]
this I think that you could get away
with different use cases I think you
could also sell that as a
training device for runners increase
your wind resistance or or an
acceleration for bikes if you're on the
like going for a bike ride you could be
like yo we'll get you the sale you get
that wind on your back dude and we got
you cruising you know what I mean all
right I got the paint a picture in your
mind so right we'll get back to the
business idea but I like cycling right
but I don't like doing it with others
because The Stereotype of cyclist being
jerks is pretty true okay yeah in my
experience as a cyclist so I go out by
myself I go on Long bik rides but when I
do ride with others when I have in the
past they have like their own language
that they shout to each other right
there'll be a whole pelaton there's like
50 of them and the guy in the front sees
a pothole and he's like pothole then
everyone else is like Poole and like
they have this whole vocabulary and like
that's one reason I don't like writing
with them because I don't know what
they're doing and it freaks out every

[03:00]
they're doing and it freaks out every
time someone yells I'm like what's
what's happening right right and so I'm
just picturing all these cyclists as if
they didn't look stupid enough right
they're all wearing a squirrel suit in
addition to their Spandex and the guy in
the front just goes elbows up like
elbows up and they all do this and they
just catch this wi oh my gosh be so good
yeah it could be like ankle weights A
variation of ankle weights for runners
or I'm just saying dude look the shake
weight sold like a100 Million worth of
shake the stupider the better I'm just
saying get yourself a resistance suit
dude yeah the algorithm loves comments
and the more commenters say this is the
most viral video ever is someone going
for a jog in a squirrel suit like dude
you know what I mean you get in there
you get a little bit of money dude you
get you say bolt is a spokes person you
would dude that's the the reality though
is you get a video of you seeing Bolt
run into one of those things bro I

[04:00]
run into one of those things bro I
promise you you're Maks give him 49% of
the business cuz that's the whole
buiness saying dude just and it's just
that ass oh you and you got to name it
something stupid like the name has to
match it's got to be like the Snuggie
you know what I mean yeah it has to be
like squirrel
leex combine squirrel and Athletics or
squirrel speed it's so good it's so good
I wonder how you really did level it up
I mean there's just so many use cases
that is funny because I had this guy on
my show once and he had an idea for a it
was like a space heater that was
attached to a timer so it's like when
you wake up your room would already be
warm and it made me think of Michael
Scott's
idea Forman yeah and like we were kind
of just ideating live and working
through it and it's like you don't need
to develop this like you buy a space
heater from China you buy a timer from
China you put it together even if

[05:01]
China you put it together even if
there's no like soldering or technical
like you literally just put them
together in one box maybe the only thing
proprietary is your box and your
branding on the box and you just put the
two things in the same and he's like
what you can't do that there's nothing
I'm like it doesn't matter none of this
matters welcome to drop shipping bro
like that's it's F you think Amazon
cares that this isn't Innovative no no
dude so how many things like that from
China are like you don't need a mold you
don't need R&D you just take something
and say hey this squirrel suit you have
for the Sky Jumpers can you just make it
like a little shorter there yeah no
problem there's so many things like that
literally we'll do it in a week like you
can have a sample on your door in 30
days or less like
dude yeah I I really want to get on a
paddle board right now dude especially
one of our suits on just hling around I
know it was fun man it was literally fun
you're just getting blown around up

[06:00]
you're just getting blown around up
on the paddle board yeah dude no one's
mad at all little below well for our
first I don't know what the segment is
called but the idea is to take something
dumb to something smart and you level up
level you shown brightly hey your colors
are shining through I'm just trying to
get another invite back what can I
say all right I got another one for you
yeah so I'm embarrassed by this one okay
because I got so excited about it in the
do you ever have an idea and you're like
oh this is it and like you buy a domain
and you do all the and then the next
morning you start looking at mansions on
Zilla yeah and the next morning you're
like I'm literally an idiot there's
nothing good about this
idea this was me I never forget I was in
Hawaii with my family and I think I was
playing some dumb game on my phone Candy
Crush I don't know and I got a really
high score and these games they want you
to think that you're really good so you
keep playing and so I Googled it I was
like what's a good score for I don't
remember let's say it was Candy Crush
right and this is embarrassing but hey

[07:00]
right and this is embarrassing but hey
we're being vulnerable here yeah and
there were no results and it's like
what's a good score for this like how do
I know this is good and so my idea in
the moment is just simply a website
what's a Goods score.com right it and
it's just content and I was at first I
was thinking like for games it's just
like programmatic it's just content play
you get all the most popular games you
scrape them some steam or bestsellers
PlayStation whatever and then you just
you know what's good score for XYZ and
then you upload a bunch of data assuming
that people are searching for this and I
think back then I did some research in
people work there wasn't like a random
message board for fortnite or a
subreddit but there was no centralized
place where people could like Benchmark
themselves in a game against other
people and then I thought oh maybe the
bigger play here is like standardized
tests mcap lsap sat AC spicy now a lot
of these people like you're studying for
the LSAT you kind of know what a good
score is right right but you might not

[08:01]
score is right right but you might not
know where you stand right what
percentile are you so it could be like a
percentiles because everyone wants to
know percentiles I check my kids
percentiles for hide and weight like
every month right yeah yeah yeah and so
I got so excited credit score dude there
you go credit car yeah I need to bleep
that out because they're not paying me
to say that no dude come on now we gotta
get that the affiliate code so I
remember I logged into name chep from
the beach I bought whatsgood score.com I
think I left Nick an audio message
message and I was like dude you got to
hear this and I I think I remember he
was like I'm sure it's great he's like
trying to be a good friend he's like I'm
just not seen it yet I need to think
about it a little more and then the next
day I was like there's nothing good that
that was so dumb what okay so make it
good for me what do we got what do we
got how can we make this good oh that's
a tough one to make good bro I like it I
think that competitive benchmarking is
like the backbone of a couple B like
glass door right like it's the same sort
of of philosophy behind salaries right

[09:01]
of of philosophy behind salaries right
like where do I stack up against others
maybe that's the domain where do I
stand.com where do I stand.com yeah you
know what I mean but this content
aggregation of everyone needs to upload
their own stuff it feels like there's a
few sites that are like this like the
rate my professors of the world right I
think the challenge with that one for
where do I stand is like what's the
actual utility that the mass Market gets
out of that content right my
professor it like I get to change some
of my decision- making based on like
what content other people have shared
versus a very like oh where do I stand
as just competitive Benchmark and on
something like glass door works because
the impact of knowing that you are
getting paid 20% less than all of your
peers in the same location and the same
thing like gives you leverage to go make
meaningful action on whatever and it's a

[10:00]
meaningful action on whatever and it's a
high value
audience versus like Candy Crush guys
you know what I mean is this as good a
good score are people going to get that
into participating in it on a third
party versus just within the game itself
you know what I mean I don't know yeah
let me level it up then so forget games
forget test scores okay where do I
stand.com go back to your travel idea
similar concept okay I'm a 37-year-old
white male living in the North Northeast
Dallas suburbs this is what I make per
year this is how many kids I I have
these are the pills that I take or don't
take these are how many I have three
best friends I have seven acquaintances
I've been divorced whatever you lay it
all out there you lay it bare and it's
like how am I doing where do I stand how
am I doing well you fall underneath the
national average of number of divorces
in a lifetime so like you're and then
it's like one of the most popular
subreddits is roast me right and so it's
like you can have a toggle yeah you

[11:00]
like you can have a toggle yeah you
could have a toggle of like how brutal
do you want me to be it's like be kind
or like you know what just be honest or
just be like roast be right right and
then it spits out all this data like
using data and it's like yeah you're in
the bottom 15% like you got to get your
crap together here's how you could get
your crap together affiliate link
affiliate link you go to Credit Karma
you go to here you go to here you go to
here or it's like you're doing really
really well but have you thought about a
wealth advisor here's who your wealth
advisor right see I like that one more I
think that goes viral I think people
would be so intrigued because I feel
that way like we've had conversation
about we're like I'm 27 I'm at a
specific point in my career and I don't
always know how to compare like not that
I'm trying to compare myself but it's
like outside of my immediate circle I
don't have a frame of reference around
like how I'm pacing and like in our
conversation specifically like around
income net worth and things like that
but like like where do I stand dude like
am I killing it like I can only do it
off of like little bits of information

[12:01]
off of like little bits of information
like top 1% income of age right like I
can use that as a benchmark but having
it all into a complete thing would be
pretty dope I think the Google Trends
and Google search data would prove out
the fact that people want to know
percentiles for income right I think
that is a common thing to check and if
you Google any celebrities name what's
like the first autocomplete it's like
Networth nworth or wife right yeah so
it's like it's playing on that and it's
like it's kind of like a viral BuzzFeed
quiz right plus AI it would be like
you'd have to put like celebrity where
celebrities stand as the content
strategy and then the CTA would be like
see how you
compare like you know what I mean like
yeah Dwayne The Rock Johnson is worth
this much he's had this much this this
this this how do you compare compare
load in all your information your BMI is
6% better than Oprah like you start to
like actually make the comparisons would
be that interesting all right if you are

[13:00]
be that interesting all right if you are
watching this clip right now you are
watching this on YouTube and if you are
a fan of podcast please check out my
podcast while you're at it because
sometimes I have podcasts that aren't on
YouTube and sometimes I have YouTubes
that aren't on podcast so check out the
ker office on any podcast platform or
you can go to TKO pod.com also my
newsletter will throw that in there
there are no ads It's weekly it's
different content than my podcast and
YouTube newsletter. chrisj cerner.com
You'll see the link and we'll see you
there or hey think about it this way
like health and fitness where do I stand
I'm 37 years old oh upload your aura
ring data up you know connect to Strava
connect to Garmin okay I'm sure they
have some tools like this but it's like
okay you're doing okay Chris you could
do a little more cardio you need more
greens in your diet here's a link to
athletic greens just like yeah yeah
maybe that's it maybe it's like where do
I stand and it's like there all
different types of categories income
health Fitness marriage personal mental
health relationships everything V1 of
that doesn't even have to be based on
user generated stuff you just train an
llm on all of the statistical data on

[14:02]
llm on all of the statistical data on
every category that you want to talk
about and then they fill out a type form
you pump it through zap through chat
using that thing and it pumps out a
result that's like you could pump out a
50-page eBook for them on like where do
you stand on the seven main pillars of
your life health wealth relationship
kids whatever you decide each has a
prompt each creates a chapter it punts
it all together all using zapier and you
sling it here's another use case so you
familiar with the the websites like
partner stack you heard of partner stack
yeah yeah for sure or like CJ it's like
a affiliate marketplaces right yes so if
I want an affiliate code to go shill
Shopify Shopify is goingon to say hey go
to partner stack they handle all that
for us you go to partner stack you fill
out your own profile they approve you
takes a day or two then they say you're
approved now you can get affiliate links
for hundreds of companies as opposed to
having to go all of them okay so you go
get approved a partner stack and this
recent for me CU I just got approved a
partner stack right you go to partner

[15:02]
partner stack right you go to partner
stack and you export all of the
affiliate links for tidy Cal type form
Shopify everything and then you go the
tech route still where do I stand.com
and it's hey here's my tech stack all
right I'm using tidy Cal for this or I'm
using cenly for this I'm using Google
workspace for this I'm using this for
this and it's like okay it's pretty good
it could do better tidy Cal is actually
29 for Lifetime you're paying 39 a month
for cly here's an affiliate link here's
an affiliate link here's an affiliate
link and it's just you don't even need
to collect emails it's just like a
landing page with a form it's like a
business
optimization bot and it's free like yeah
because you get you pick up all your Rev
on the back on a zoomed out kind of
macro level of it I think the challenge
with stuff like
that comes down to providing enough
context to improve the quality of the
output because take Kenly versus like
tidy cow as an example if you're
optimizing for saving money it's obvious

[16:02]
optimizing for saving money it's obvious
that you would switch over if all else
is equal but if you moving into like how
does this interact with other tools or
how does this interact with the uh
multiple team members or there's so much
Nuance that ends up happening over time
that goes into the tool selection
process that I'd be nervous not nervous
but like aware of the fact that like
you're not going to be able to capture
all of that Nuance to make a high
quality recommendation for everybody
like yeah this is like the the downside
not downside of AI but like the risk of
it is like overusing it where it might
just be better as a blog post like
here's the stack that I would recommend
and the blog can just go viral versus
building all this stuff to be like input
all your information we'll give you a
tool and we'll send you affiliate links
it's like what if we just wrote a Blog
and made an affiliate link for it okay
two more deviations of this idea let's
rip so first of all where do I stand.com
is a premium domain for sale for 1,900

[17:01]
is a premium domain for sale for 1,900
bucks so honestly that's not bad I don't
hate it you could do any number of names
for this doesn't have to be that but so
one is to answer your question there you
could have much like the roast me right
you have three toggle buttons on this
you could have three toggle buttons
where it's like what are you optimizing
for Time Savings efficiency or something
else right or it whatever it spits out
it's like all right this one's going to
save you money but it doesn't integrate
with workspace okay so buy or beware but
both options are affiliate links so it
doesn't care what you pick right yeah
that's and have you heard of Andrew
Wilkinson's new business that's
basically just like a referral site for
influencers I think so dude is co let me
look it up real quick dude I don't know
the name of this website but I talked to
someone that was like working on it and
well I'll say that for after so this
website all it does is it shows you like
a day in the life of an influencer maybe

[18:01]
a day in the life of an influencer maybe
huberman right and it's like I wake up
and I get in my infrared sonor affiliate
link infrared sauna affiliate link and
then I drink my athletic greens
affiliate link and then and supposedly
it's like what these influencers
actually do supposedly and it's just
it's like a Blog article that's just
static never changes and there's just
Affiliates that's it it's just like a
standing person that's sick yes and I
love stuff I was talking to someone at
Main Street that was working on it and
they said they were netting like 50
Grand a month just off affiliate yeah
how like that was the whole thing and
how passive is that right yeah that's
insane it could be a tool that like
enables that for influencers where you
connect it to your IG account or
something and it's like okay here's your
Tex stack boom affiliate links it could
be in your link tree it could do to text
Stacks what link tree does to
Links but it's really just another Link
in your link tree yeah yeah yeah okay

[19:01]
in your link tree yeah yeah yeah okay
you see what I'm saying it's like a
standardized Tech stack for anyone on
the internet right and the affiliate
links could be affiliate affiliate links
someone does need to do what Wilkinson
is doing but for companies you can pull
all of that data off of built with yeah
yeah like oh oh yeah immediately like
what tools does Salesforce use oh we
could do it with programmatic SEO and
web flow direct dude come on a little
all the combinations of that that's what
I'm saying like all Interlink together
dual CMS companies paired with tools
they're just relational databases all
have affiliate links that are ours
here's what Salesforce uses here's what
even small companies here's what Texas
snacks uses like Shopify plus clavio
plus ant plus and it just creates this
crazy web and you click on clav and go
here's all the other brands or
businesses is that we know uses this

[20:00]
businesses is that we know uses this
yeah it's like this tree right it's like
Texas snacks uses clavio click on clavio
clavio uses amp click on Amped Amped
uses and they're all affiliate links
it's all affiliate links that are all
just pumping off cash oh my God I ha
that dude that's a good it's good we got
from Candy Crush to trillion dollar
business idea that's sick with a tea I
like it you know what's not cool anymore
a billion dude another thing I was
thinking cuz you were saying like how
could you make sure that integrated like
for this tool could just connect your
Gmail and it could read your emails and
say all right you're using calendly I
see your slack billing notification
you're using slack just like a one-click
integration and it could tell you what
your text stack was and then it could
say you know keep slack Slack's working
really well for your use case but swap
tidy Cal with cenly I love that that'd
be sick you have to get that smart with
it it's like what are the other five
competitors like oh you use cly here are
five Alternatives that we think makes
sense yeah like we don't have to get

[21:01]
sense yeah like we don't have to get
that ing graded because if they're
searching for it they're looking for a
solution they're like I'm tired with
like all of the ad say are you tired of
cly here's five things that might be
able to help you fill in team
size then you sell all those leads on
the back end to somebody else you know
what I mean like you're just getting all
these business owners to say here's how
much money we make here's how much we
spend on Tech every year Let It Ride get
all the
data I'd take that dude how much do you
spend on marketing every year 25,000
dude you should talk over the boys that
quicker you know dude you could bank
money by selling the data you could
charge for the actual quiz and then you
could have affiliate
links multiple monetization
dude I wonder if there's a world where
you could charge based on the savings
like all right everything we recommended
you is going to save you 34,000 a month
there's there's I don't know if I can
talk about it but you should talk to our
buddy Connor about that okay they're
working on like that he's Loosely I

[22:01]
working on like that he's Loosely I
don't know where they're at with it now
but like was Loosely in conversations
around some of that like a cost savings
oh I know what he's looking at it's a
franchise right yeah we've been talking
about that I didn't know he was still
looking at it that was a few months ago
I don't know I don't know if he still is
I I had the conversation with them like
two or three months ago Dude if you're
that franchise like you're stupid for
not using AI to help oh right identify
stuff lowest hanging fruit yeah yeah
there's so much you could do with that
dude I have two things that I think you
might find
interesting I want to hear all three of
them because two is not enough there can
be a third I can sneak in a third all
right give me some idea crack dude so
one is another Super Niche content site
that I've seen lately that is in line
like with the travel one that I sent you
and the fact that it just looks so old
but it gets so many views it is I think
it's a view fromy
seat.com what
dude there it is dude so it's it's like

[23:03]
dude there it is dude so it's it's like
this 1990 site and people upload the
view from their seat at concerts and
sporting events the thing gets like a
million clicks a month oh my gosh and
it's crowdsourced oh all crowdsourced
100% you just upload your own thing GC
user generated content user generated
content it's all them uploading a photo
from their seat at a specific stadium
for a specific sporting event and you
can go find the exact views because all
seat gey I was buying tickets to the
Kansas City Chiefs are playing the
Chargers at Sofi and you go on seat geek
or Ticket Master or any of these things
and they give you like Loosely of view
you know what I mean like this like view
the a generated or yeah like from the
section of what it generally looks like
and so I just went on Google and I typed
in Sofi Stadium section 30 whatever Row
one C whatever SEO they own the SEO they

[24:00]
one C whatever SEO they own the SEO they
owned it it was the first thing up there
View fromy seat.com and I pop in and
there was like four photos of people
that sat in the exact seats for football
games that I was in and I was like yep
that's exactly what's good and
then two days
ago and I didn't say this to anybody I
did not say a word about this literally
to a soul this was like a month and a
half
ago yes yesterday or two days ago my
girlfriend gets tickets to the Dodgers
from her work and she sends me a link
from VI fromy seat.com of the view that
we're gonna have at the Dodgers game and
I was like oh my gosh what is happening
it's a sign from the Universe I was like
dude what is going on here like these
guys are killing it I don't know their
monetization I don't know what any of it
looks like but like one of those kind of
Niche content sites like a where do I
stand or whatever like a view fromy
seat.com dude
okay this is amazing okay so the other

[25:00]
okay this is amazing okay so the other
Cruise business you told me about is
vacations too.com yes and after I did a
deep dive on that I learned it's
literally like a billion dollar business
with a huge because cruise is such a
high ticket item right right once you
realize that it's like oh they're only
selling like 5,000 cruises a year and
people go you know what I'm saying like
it makes sense so I want to make like 10
to 20 websites like this I want to find
them that are like a view for my seat
there's another one I tweeted about this
on my old Twitter account that's called
like Nextbook inth series.com you heard
about that no I haven't seen it it's
just like what's the next book in Lord
of the Rings and it's that's it that's
the whole it's been around for like 15
years and it's ugly it's never been
updated and they just print it's just a
thing I want to find I dude how about
this like a directory of sites like this
directory stupid growth hack yeah stupid
growth hackers like us so we can just go
like reverse engineer and learn and
Tinker like maybe two niche
but do they sell anything of you for my

[26:01]
but do they sell anything of you for my
seat I don't know but I was thinking
like they should just be absolutely
slinging Ticket Master oh yeah like you
know what I mean I'm I'm clicking around
right now I didn't see anything that was
obvious monetization on it but it's just
like an OG Forum dude like create a post
with the stadium like that's it okay so
I'm looking it looks like they have
affiliate links to hotels
view I'm looking in my arc browser and
it's blocking the ads so I'm I'm
switching browsers they're running like
direct like display ads for sure yeah so
like they basically have like a
Booking.com API polling listings they
have a verbo display ad on the right
side so they're doing stuff they're
pushing StubHub so if you go and click
on if you go to like concerts at the top
it has a list of all of the musicians oh
dude they're all right dude they're
probably okay they're doing just fine
and then you click on yeah so you click
on one of the artists
and then it has all the Arenas but it

[27:00]
and then it has all the Arenas but it
also has all the upcoming events and you
can StubHub ticket them oh my gosh and
what demographic of person buys $300 NFL
tickets right like such a high value
audience here right right all of it
concerts team like the whole thing this
is one of those businesses that some
like Millennial is going to buy one day
and they're going to rebuild it and
they're just going to kill it and like a
view from my seat it's too long of a do
domain name we need to buy seats.
we need to change like the user
interface isn't intuitive D it's going
to make all these changes and just kill
it like if I own this site I would
change nothing no I'd put an email popup
yeah yeah yeah yeah for sure you know
what I mean that's it just an email
popup my gosh want to find deals on your
favorite stuff email
popup dude this is a good one this is
really good super fire I'm Gonna Leave
This open in my browser it's fun dude
their map like on the map you can go
look at all the venues that they have on
like a Google Maps overlay it's

[28:01]
like a Google Maps overlay it's
fun okay yeah I like this a lot I just
went to a Rangers game on Monday and I
did not come across this website but I
did have fun but now you dude now you'll
always know the view from your seat I
will dude and this business has such a
moat because they have all this user
generated content it's like how we think
about it with creative OS it's like yeah
someone could come and build the same
functionality but no one at without
spending so much time money and energy
would be able bble to create the actual
like supply of content they have years
and years and years of of users
uploading views from their seat and
that's just like you can't easily
replicate that you're not going to like
go send your SDR team to like a billion
sporting events to you know what I mean
it's just not gonna happen yeah I feel
like this business exists in the face of
all these AI tools that basically do the
same thing and it's like it exists
because of this framework I have where
it's like we always prefer a human
there's a line there's a price point

[29:00]
there's a line there's a price point
right at at a certain price point if
it's 80% cheaper AI is fine but it's
like we need an operator first of all no
matter what AI tools are out there
you're going to need someone to run the
thing right which creates all these
opportunities like Peter levels is you
know taking advantage of but it's like
these pictures you can't do better you
just can't do better than someone taking
an actual picture from that actual seat
right at the actual event that you want
to go to like yes it's unreal so good oh
so all right so you had two things
what's the other thing dude the other
one it's a product category there's a
few players that are participating in
this but it is people
selling signature
templates so you'll go you'll get an ad
and it'll be somebody signing their name
really pretty like calligraphy type
stuff like high quality signatures and
it's an ad for you to have an artist
create your custom signature and send

[30:00]
create your custom signature and send
you training materials on like stencils
so you can learn how to sign no with
this dude I've found talking email
signature or like a physical signature
no like a physical like signing
autograph like these people will create
your autograph for you and then send you
a stencil so that you can like practice
signing it I think these companies are a
lot bigger than people think do you know
the name of one I have some of their ads
saved you're exploding my brain right
now anyone on the planet brings this
idea to me and says Chris what do you
think I want to do this I'm gonna laugh
them out of the room and say spend your
time on something that will actually
make you money there's no demand here
dude I feel you I feel you but like I'm
looking at photol logo.com okay I'm
getting there yeah you order your custom
signature for
$39 for an extra $40 cell it follows the
same Dynamic of like personalized stuff

[31:02]
same Dynamic of like personalized stuff
right so like handwritten letters at
scale yeah you know what I mean or it's
like hey I want to get a a portrait
painted of my dog right where you like
upload this custom thing and get this
custom thing back and so people are
doing this with signatures I'm not going
to sit here and Venture a guess on if
they actually have professionally
trained calligraphers creating your
custom signature but like the odds of
that are low where it's like I think
these are computer generated things that
are it's 100% margin like sorry 99%
margin that you're like shipping them a
piece of paper that they can practice
writing which like I don't even think
they actually send it to you I think
they send you an email that you print
out it's I'm sure they have an upcharge
right where you could get the physical
one and so I'll send you a few more of
these but they're all running ads
aggressively if you can aggressively run
ads for a $40 product you're doing just
fine and that's like the broad product

[32:00]
fine and that's like the broad product
category that I like is mimics digital
product or info product right where it's
like you're selling a zero Cog item on
Facebook meaning like you're
running for lack of better word the
simplest Financial game on ads possible
where it's like Revenue ver ad spent
right and so it's like if you can go and
and
operate you know if you're running an
Ecom brand with true cogs like you're
break even row as goes up you know this
well right like you have to have a 1.8
to break even but on a digital product
you have to have a
1.000000 to break even because you have
no cogs and so if you can even hit a 1
point2 consistently and you can spend
say you can spend $1,000 doll a day at a
1.2 on a digital product like you're
just actually profiting $200 a day yeah
like and I think that there are
businesses like that again like going

[33:01]
businesses like that again like going
back to what we've talked about a
recurring theme of like we're not trying
to pitch somebody like a billion dollar
idea but do I think that there are
people that could like launch this exact
thing and run at a 1.2 to 1.6x row as
and spend a th000 $2,000 a day and like
net profit 150k a year yeah it's not
going to be like groundbreaking but like
you can the hardest part for me about
these segments is I want to listen to
you so badly cuz what you're saying is
so intelligent but I cannot stop
thinking about my way to hopefully level
up what you're saying like I'm just yeah
you know how I would grow this and I I
am listening I heard all that I am
listening there's two million real
estate agents I'm looking at their
website and here's here's a framework
framework right we need a little jingle
Mohammad work that in need a little
little framework jingle if you want to
know who business is selling to look at
who they're pointing to on their website

[34:02]
who they're pointing to on their website
right like back when it was support
Shephard right I was like all right who
are they selling vas for short form
video editing for bookkeeping and it's
like you just go and look what are their
case studies about what are their
reviews about what is the ordering of
their services on their drop down
homepage on the menu right if they put
bookkeeping first they're not stupid
they're probably leading people to where
people already want to go okay let's
bundle support Shepherd and make support
Shepherd for bookkeeping only right so
I'm looking at this website and they're
talking about all about Realtors right
it's not like Photo logo for
realtors.com but it's very clear they're
doing this for because like Realtors are
signing documents all day every all the
time Realtors are more likely to be
women all right you can call me sexist
but Realtors are more likely to be women
and women are more likely to care about
their appearance or vain things period
end story and Men stink right so there
you go I offset it Men smell like crap
so there you go but anyway like I would

[35:02]
so there you go but anyway like I would
advertise this by scraping all two
million email addresses of Realtors and
emailing them their own signature for
free and saying hey an Frank look what I
got you what do you like what do you
think and 2% of them are going to be
like that's really cool how do I buy
that click to check out9 99 bucks we'll
send you the training materials it's a
lot cheaper than Facebook ads
cold email I'm not mad I'm not mad yeah
there's so many that are just like that
Sam I would not be surprised if this is
not computer generated if there actually
is literally one person cranking out a
thousand of these a day yeah yeah how
many of these could you knock out in an
hour if you're practiced yeah if you
were like a calligraphy guy like you
could probably do one a minute without a
problem do you remember the guy that was
on Shark Tank it was like draw me a cat
draw me a picture of a cat
I'm GNA look that up
draw hold on I want to draw a cat for

[36:04]
draw hold on I want to draw a cat for
you.com okay as seen on ABC's Shark Tank
been around for a decade plus this guy I
mean he says his numbers on Shark Tank
and it's probably even better now it's
literally physically him drawing anyone
a picture of a cat and it was probably
one of those Shark Tank pitches that
they included just to make fun of him
but dude click on his cly oh my gosh
this pains me I want to partner with
this guy click on his Calon link he sold
out for a year in
advance
October November December oh he's sold
out forever
$25 it says on the site he sold out for
a year dude oh my gosh so all right
first of all this guy's not an idiot
clearly he knows about supply and demand
he knows about economics 101 he must
Just Do It For the Love of the cats but
like I just want to buy this from him
and say all right first order of
business instead of $25 it's

[37:00]
business instead of $25 it's
$250 let's clear up your calendar second
order of business we're going to hire
five more catd
drawers anyway my point is it makes me
think of this because he literally does
draw it himself like look at this
website he's drawn 22,000 of these
things yeah it's insane 221 two3 time
$25 so his lifetime revenue is half a
million dollars from drawing cats from
drawing cats 100% margin who's Mt yeah
you know what I'm
saying I just think there's stuff like
that dude
like yeah sitting there dude this is the
same business as the view a view from
your seat because it's like can AI do
this yeah but AI is not doing it that's
the moat that's why this guy will be
around in 100 years assuming he lives to
be 150 years
old because he's doing it himself that's
the whole thing he's not selling a
picture of a cat he's selling the
uniqueness of him doing it himself
yeah it's like he's going to be able to
run it and do his thing and buy a new

[38:01]
run it and do his thing and buy a new
house and that's sick yeah I wonder if
there's something that photo logo could
borrow from him it's $40 but for $400
let's spend an hour kind of
whiteboarding this on Zoom yeah I'm
looking at another one that is artlogo
doco and they've got all sorts of
additional
options like hand wit premium signature
for
120 logos o their lost lead is an email
signature generator and a business card
maker you can do those for free oh my
gosh okay so then let's say I want just
like a nice little
signature choose your industry what do
you want to say left-handed right oh you
pick the ones that you like additional
notes and then they hit you with the
upsell you can have the head
calligrapher do it for $79 if you want
you can do the top level for 49 or just
a basic for 39
this art logo website they have an

[39:00]
this art logo website they have an
embedded YouTube video this video is 52
seconds and it just shows how they do it
and it has 400,000 views dude I'm saying
like I'm like I think that it's print oh
dude the upsells that they hit you with
all format packs the signature learning
pack is a PDF a logo adding new elements
email signatures business card templates
like you could get your I just selected
two or three of those options and my
yeah my aov is already at 213 and that's
just from a social media pack the
signature itself and adding a logo
element to it and like your cogs on that
dude are like the guy that made the
signature yeah for $10 like you're
talking about a 99% margin 95 sure let's
say it takes a minute to do a signature
you knock out 50 of these an hour
working a little buffer 50 * 40 That's
2,000 you could pay your cig graer quote
and then anyone that draws well can call

[40:00]
and then anyone that draws well can call
themselves a calligrapher you can pay
them $200 an hour 400 Grand a year your
cogs is 10% your margin 90% yeah I came
across it and I was like this is
interesting can I tell you why this
business exists in my opinion two
reasons and they really go hand inand 10
years ago 15 years ago this business
does not exist the internet's around
it's Living Well it's doing great
Facebook's around it is such a visual
business right it's no different than
you should see the the Tik Tok and
Instagram I'm looking 200,000 followers
the accounts that do them no ads they
just say all of it is replies to can you
do whatever letter next can you do Chris
and they just write Chris oh my gosh and
it goes crazy viral and then everyone
else requests the next it's a sell I'm
telling you like it actually might be
the perfect business for today it's sick
it's the same thing as like an ASMR
pressure washing Channel or Longo
channel it's like visual it's inherently
Visual and so it just grows because of

[41:01]
Visual and so it just grows because of
technology advancements yeah and they
just literally record themselves right
in names can you do Chris next but up
Chris cool and then I go in there and go
yo can you do Sam and then they do Sam
and then seven other people go yo can
you do and the algorithm is like oh
everyone's commenting on this let's keep
pushing it bro I'm saying like I think
that these things are like printing cash
like I have zero doubt I want to test it
hit me with a little solo drop Shopify
store couple upsells like so you want to
just rip this off blatantly straight up
I've gotten ads from four or five six
companies that all do this exact same
thing it's not like one company that's
leading it i' never heard of art logo
until today like it's just the one that
showed up on
Google and then you can go and like you
get into the interesting stuff of this
is one of those things that you could
very easily almost like tabs chocolate
where you can like Empower a bunch of
other creators to go and post with
Affiliates of like cool dude here's our
library of a thousand signature videos

[42:03]
library of a thousand signature videos
go post as many as you want we'll give
you 50% like go spin up your own perfect
signature theme page push it all back to
our affiliate link just post here's all
the content it's already here like and I
just think it could pop bro now are we
talking like a creative OS like model
for this or is that something you could
do or is that what you're talking about
no I'm saying build the library of short
form content give it to as many people
that want to run a an Instagram theme
page as possible have all of them
because if you could find a hundred
people to all run a signature theme page
account and you just give them all the
content they just they set up their own
scheduler they pick their own music they
do whatever they want to grow it they
just run all of it and the link in bio
for all of them is 50 like they just do
our organic marketing at scale for us
through 50 accounts versus us just doing

[43:01]
through 50 accounts versus us just doing
it a one branded account because like
our margin can support a pretty hefty
affiliate fee because it's no cogs and
so it's like yeah if we're doing $99
signatures yeah I'll give you 50 bucks
post as much as you want I don't care
okay here's another idea I'm gonna go
back to creative OS and you basically
build a bank of these names right like
you basically
take the 95% of all names in America you
take the Thousand most common first
names thousand most common last names
you use AI or some sort of software to
make calligraphy versions of all this
maybe let's say you have a Jane Doe it's
like all right Jane Doe might be a
photographer you take like the top 10
professions that want these signatures
she might be a photographer a real
estate agent a lawyer yeah I want you to
make 10 versions of her of Jane Doe's
logo you do that a thousand times for
each name 10,000 names 100,000 names
whatever and then you go to your example
of affiliate and say for 50 $100 $200 a
month you have full access to my library

[44:00]
month you have full access to my library
and you just go resell these you go
compete with photo logo and all them
that's super interesting they just take
whatever they want whenever they want
for a monthly fee you could probably
just build an AI rapper for it that
creates the custom signature you put in
or you just pick like it's a font
library at the end of the day you pick
like 30 fonts that they just put in the
name it creates these 30 variations of
it you can do that like even on like
creativemarket.com if you go to their
font Library
which they have handwritten calligraphy
Styles you can put in the sample text
that you want to see that font like as a
thing so you just go put all the name in
there and just grab all the fonts that
look like good signatures and then just
route them all through and you could
deliver 30 variations to somebody
immediately that's it that's actually
how that was going to work you would
sell it for 99 bucks we're going to give
you 10 Vari 10 variations of your name
in different calligraphy Styles you
would just route them all through shoot
you could do it on a Google doc and just
have each of them have a different font

[45:00]
have each of them have a different font
class and you buy five or 10 commercial
licenses from creative market and you
just have 10 font options and you
programmatically pop them in it rip so
it's an AI wrapper with a a bunch of
Integrations on the back end to
customize it even more customize the
yeah the signature yeah because I feel
like you got to go one way or the other
you got to go like AI wrapper you just
lean into it but you add some more
functionality to it so you can just
replicate that in chat gbt or you got to
go completely away from Ai and make it
very handmade hand
yeah either one's cool I'm down Sam you
brought the heat today I do my best this
is this might be one of my favorite
episodes
ever I'm just gonna say it I've said it
before they keep leveling up this is
good yeah that's that's all you can ask
