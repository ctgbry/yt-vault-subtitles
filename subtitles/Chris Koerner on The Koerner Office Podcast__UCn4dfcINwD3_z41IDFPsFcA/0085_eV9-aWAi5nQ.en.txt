remember how everyone thought liquid
death and 5H Hour Energy were stupid
ideas and now they're billion- dooll
companies well I have a stupid billion
dooll business idea that I'm going to
tell you about at the end of this video
here's why this idea is not stupid a
there are more dogs than kids in the
United States right now B parents will
spend any amount of money on their dog C
I have done the keyword research for
this term and there is much much more
demand than Supply what are we going to
do we are going to sell dog electrolytes
and we are going to tug at the
heartstrings of these pet owners by
saying do you know how your dog licks
you when you're all sweaty that's
because he's low on electrolytes you
should fix that we're going to have 80%
gross margins we're going to use
influencer marketing we're going to use
short form video paid Google ads and
paid Facebook ads will this work
absolutely should you do it absolutely
follow me for more info like this and
listen to episode 25 of the ker office
that's a TKO pod.com where I break down
this whole idea for free
