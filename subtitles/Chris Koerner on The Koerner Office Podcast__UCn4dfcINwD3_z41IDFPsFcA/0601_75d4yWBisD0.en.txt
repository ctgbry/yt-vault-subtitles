hey Chris this is Austin really love the
Pod and everything else you guys bring
to the table here with business ideas
Etc actually working on something myself
based on something I heard on your pod I
just had a quick question as I start my
first company what's your advice on
doing the bookkeeping and accounting and
how do you ever really get that started
great question Austin I don't talk about
bookkeeping that much frankly because I
hate it and it's the bane of my
existence but it's a great question and
I'm happy to answer it I look at book
keeping as having three thresholds
number one Google Sheets number two
QuickBooks number three bigger than
QuickBooks and honestly I've never
gotten to number three before because
QuickBooks can handle businesses of over
$100 million okay number one Google
Sheets very simple revenues expenses you
can export your bank account I suggest
Mercury and or Bank of America
preferably Mercury we like Bank of
America because they integrate with zel
and we need zel for some of our
subcontractors and Mercury does not but

[01:00]
subcontractors and Mercury does not but
this is how I look at it personal
checking account to start to validate
the business okay once I see I've got
revenue this is going to be a thing I do
two things I go file an LLC and get an
EIN number AKA tax ID number and then I
will use those documents to go get a
business bank account preferably with
Mercury and then I will take the ghou
sheet that I use to track all the
expenses in my personal bank account and
I will true it all up I will get
everything in the business bank account
and then I will run everything through
that business bank account from that
point on very strict even if like I have
a business that's putting 30 grand a
month on Facebook ads and it's really
tempting to get a a credit card to get
2% cash back or AMX points or something
I don't mess with that I used to but
it's just like honestly if I had one
business and I knew I was only going to
have one I probably would do that i'
would get a Capital One or a venture
card or something to get points but when
I have a you know a half dozen
businesses I don't want a half dozen
credit cards a half dozen debit cards a
half dozen bank accounts half dozen
venmo accounts PayPal it is an absolute

[02:00]
venmo accounts PayPal it is an absolute
nightmare so I'll put everything in that
mercury account on the debit card and
then I will keep tracking everything in
the same Google sheet my debits to my
credits and then the second threshold is
when I'll find a bookkeeper I used to
set up QuickBooks myself manage it
myself but it's not a good use of my or
your time so it's not hard to use anyone
can use QuickBooks it's just not a good
use of your time even if you like it
don't do it right you're better off
marketing or selling your product or
service so get a bookkeeper you can find
thousands of bookkeepers for low
hundreds of dollars a month it's money
well spent they'll get in QuickBooks for
you they'll do all the hairy stuff
they'll maintain it you just want a panl
and a a balance sheet every month that's
it panl and balance sheet every month
and every year of course and maybe
quarterly if you're into that kind of
thing but LLC always but don't forget
LLC is a pass through entity which means
you are taxed on the profit of your
business you are not taxed on what you
pull out of your business so if you make
a million dollar of net profit profit in

[03:00]
a million dollar of net profit profit in
your business but you're using most of
that for growth or for ads or for
inventory and you only take home
$200,000 guess what your tax bill is
going to be almost twice what you took
out and put in your personal checking
account so prepare for that a lot of
people are surprised by that and you
have to make quarterly estimated taxes
tax payments and that's a pain and I
hate everything about taxes and
bookkeeping in the IRS and I have been
audited and it was the worst period of
my life I wouldn't wish it on my worst
enemy but don't overthink it Google
sheet one dedicated business bank
account once you're sure this is going
to be a thing and then find a bookkeeper
don't pay him any more than a few
hundred bucks a month maybe 500 Max
depending on how complex it is we have a
crypto business with all kinds of
different accounts and crypto
transactions that's a lot more complex
but if everything's coming through a
bank account very little cash you
shouldn't need to pay that much you can
find a virtual assistant that's really
really good to do it for you as well get
everything categorized in QuickBooks and
then everything will automatically fall
into their buckets all right that's it

[04:00]
into their buckets all right that's it
please give me a festar review I need
some five star reviews share with a
friend love you guys really appreciate
you we will see you next time
