all right I've got a secret weapon when
it comes to buying domain names for
pennies on the dollar so I use this tool
that has domain name auctions but what's
brilliant about it is it also shows you
how old the domain name is and how many
backlinks it has backlinks give the
domain Authority which make it easier to
rank in Google search results and a
domain name age makes websites more
trusted by Google as well so every time
I buy a domain name I go to D do I look
at their expired listings and their
current auctions and their last chance
auctions and I'll start shopping around
for things that look interesting then
I'll find what I call asymmetric bets
and that's a good-look domain name with
four or less syllables two or less
words. only that's expiring soon then if
it's at least 5 years old has at least
20 backlinks I'll bid on it and I'm
almost always able to get 50 to 70% off
highquality domain names when I do this
only on D do.com I did a full tutorial
on domain name investing on YouTube link
