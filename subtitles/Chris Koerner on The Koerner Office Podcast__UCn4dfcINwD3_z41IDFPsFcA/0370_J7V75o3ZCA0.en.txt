look at this freaking guy right here
this guy spent $3,000 for a 40ft
inflatable Santa Claus just to troll his
neighbors and I love this idea so much I
just bought one for myself to do the
exact same thing any good idea could be
a good business idea so here's how I
plan to turn this into a brilliant
business in two different ways I know I
can buy these things for a fraction of
the price in China so my first idea
simply buy these from China for 1,500
bucks and sell them on Facebook
Marketplace for 3,000 or just let the
things sell themselves cuz they're
freaking 40 ft tall and that leads me
into idea number two which I love even
more I happen to live on a street that
gets 22,000 cars driving by it per day
is that ideal no but can I monetize that
yes and so can you here's how go to your
State's Department of Transportation
website and find out how many cars drive
by your house or by your neighborhood
every day let's say it's 10,000 now
we're going to divide that number by
1,000 to get a CPM 10,000 cars a day
divided by 1,000 equals 10 a billboard
CPM is about $20 that means that if you
were to put an ad on that Santa Claus it
would be worth about $200 every day to
an Advertiser so this is literally what
I'm going to do in real life and I'm

I'm going to do in real life and I'm
going to document this whole thing I'm
going to put a banner on my Santa Claus
that says TKO pod.com because that's my
podcast but I'm going to use a tracking
URL and a QR code to track exactly how
many people go to that website only from
that Banner so once you find out how
much the traffic driving by your house
is worth reach out to some potential
sponsors and ask if they're interested
in placing their ad or their Banner on
your Santa Claus if I'm a local car
dealer with an endof year sale you
better believe I want my ad on that
freaking Santa my Santa will be here
next week and I'll post more videos
along the way full business plans here
