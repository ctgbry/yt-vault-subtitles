we're finally doing
it I know this is awesome also this is a
very Shameless pitch Nick has a podcast
of his own called Nick anomic that's Nik
anomic

[01:00]
anomic
and he's going live here in a couple
days so give that a shot it's basically
like the ker office except for people
that want to buy a business or who have
recently bought a business and need some
help so you brought some notes to this
meeting why don't you kick this off what
do you want to talk about today we
bought a van yesterday dude I was
thinking about this I didn't and I was
going to text you this
morning by next week we are going to
have two additional companies added to
our
portfolio we're investing in a
commercial cleaning company uh
commercial kitchen cleaning company in
Tampa and our pet crematorium otherwise
affectionately known as burning
dogs will be open next week too okay we
don't say that in public it's called
Sunbeam Paws Sunbeam I'm I'm sorry yes
Sunbeam paw but dude I I was like
anyways it was just cool was like a cool
realization to see that we're going to
do that that is cool yeah that's and

[02:00]
do that that is cool yeah that's and
one's in Tampa right the kitchen
cleaning one yeah the commercial kitchen
cleaning ones in Tampa it's with a
Searcher that we met off of Twitter good
business stable business I was an idiot
we were first doing the research on it
and I was like it's a hood cleaning
business and I sent it to Chris and
Chris is like oh I know a guy who owns a
business
and we got the information or like his
perspective on it he's yeah hood
cleaning sucks so I go back to the
Searcher and I tell him by the way the
guy we talked to says hood cleaning
sucks so I don't know if we're going to
do this he's that's a really small part
of our business did I not explain this
well to you
and I'm sure you'll be surprised
apparently I just didn't listen very
well to what he was explaining isn't
that crazy must have a lot going
on it's it's a commercial kitchen and
Appliance cleaning business so the hoods
are a part of it but anyways they're in
a growing Market that we're really
excited about small business that we're
hoping to grow and expand and at the
same time we have an investment in this
company called Sunbeam paw which Chris
has been spending a ton of time on
getting the crematorium set up and we
bought a freaking ban yesterday and I

[03:01]
bought a freaking ban yesterday and I
texted Chris and I'm like did was that a
personal loan yeah yeah personal Alan
and I just slap myself in the forehead
like oh gosh dang it should have been
through the business but Chris doesn't
wait Chris is
mi's I make it happen mih equals make it
happen if you're unfamiliar first of all
first thought before I forget is you
should do a whole podcast episode about
that deal and just break it down to why
you like it second thought is we were G
to put in some cash for Sunbeam paw me
us you and I and Stephen were going to
put in 50/50 and then most of that was
for the van and it was like it's a
$115,000 van and I have this Credit
Union that I use for an RV our personal
minivan whatever and the loan's seven
and a qu 7 and 3/4% and I thought shoot
jeez I can make more than 7 and 3/4% on
my cash zero money down like I'll take a
loan all day I'll put that 15 grand in a
something else how did you find it Matt

[04:02]
something else how did you find it Matt
the operator found
it can I just say something the real
quick I got to tell you this I got to
tell you this okay the owner of the van
is an OBGYN and don't ask me why an
OBGYN has a refrigerated van her last
name is yeah I don't want to say this on
air I don't want people to Google her
but it's just a very funny last name for
someone that's in OBG I'll say that I'll
say I'll let your imagination run wild
on that one but here's how the unit
economics breakdown on Sunbeam pause so
we already have a customer lined up that
owns he owns 5% Equity also Nick I don't
even think you know what our Equity
split is on this business SOA I'll tell
you now I was literally going to
ask so we own
15% 15 Ste Steven owns 15% and then the
veterinarian that will be our first
customer that's been our adviser owns 5%
and then the operator owns
65% okay and we are out Outsourcing most

[05:02]
65% okay and we are out Outsourcing most
of our operations to a competitor about
45 minutes away and we are going despite
the fact that we don't need to buy a
burner we are going to have 80% gross
margins from day one instead of 93% if
we owned a burner so really not in a
rush to buy a burner and we're going to
have about 20K Mr on launch day really
because our 5% Equity owner is our first
customer and we've got three or four
others lined up so let's back this up
just a minute what we're talking about
is Sunbeam Paws there has been a huge
explosion in pet ownership especially
since the pandemic and unfortunately the
upside excuse me the downside of the
upside of owning more pets is there are
going to be more pets dying and we
probably a year ago looked at buying
these ABA clinics and the partner that
we looked with buying these ABA clinics
his name is Stephen hail he's on Twitter
autism clinics yep and he's for those
I'm excited about AB ba which are autism

[06:00]
I'm excited about AB ba which are autism
clinics but what I'm really excited
about is burning dogs and we were like
okay that's a funny thing to say what
are you talking about and then just
morphed over he just kept talking about
it more and more over time about pet
crematoriums the economics of it how we
had a friend how we knew a veterinarian
it's like all these pieces came together
and so eight months ago or so we said
let's do it and we found an operator who
has experience in the space and I'm
using we very Loosely this is Chris and
Steven have been working most of the
time on this we found a operator in the
space who has experience we got the
veterinarian on board and we looked at
buying a crematorium which was like a
hundred wasn't like $100,000 minimum to
buy a pet crematorium and instead of
buying the pet crematorium Chris worked
out an arrangement where we're actually
using a competitor so when he says our
gross margins are going from 93% to 85%
what he's saying there is if we had
bought the crematorium our gross margins
would be 93% but since we're Outsourcing
to a competitor they're 85% but we get
in the game and we're starting I'm super

[07:01]
in the game and we're starting I'm super
excited about it I think it's I think
it's awesome so we're starting in Dallas
and the plan is I guess yeah talk
through what's the rest of the plan for
the near future we're just going to
start acquiring more customers in the
area because our operator used to roll
up veterinary clinics here in DFW so he
has a a bunch of connections with vets
so we already have two or three lined up
dud can I tell you something I was
talking to my wife last and I'm glad I
have my I'm glad I have my headphones on
because my puppy's down at my feet right
now oh really you got that what were you
talking Chris got that dog in him Chris
got that dog in
him I was talking to my wife last night
and I told her about the van I was like
yeah we we had this company because she
heard about it we haven't talked about
it in like six months just because there
was no from my perspective no update to
be made and I was like yeah Chris bought
this van last night and she's like what
yeah you went to the credit union blah
blah blah and she was super impressed
with that and then later we were talking
about Twitter and she's so what are your
plans with XYZ thing and I'm talking

[08:01]
plans with XYZ thing and I'm talking
there's a couple things that we're
working on and I was like I'm going to
get to that this week and I'm going to
talk to this person and do this and she
just looks at me and she's you really
need to get on that like you need to act
with as much urgency as Chris does and I
was like I haven't even told you
that oh man for my wife to pay anybody a
compliment it's it'd be the equivalent
of saying something I'm not even gonna
say it it's saying something thank you
Chris thank you and let's just say I
went to bed a happy man
and when you say that Stephen and I have
been mostly working on it it's mostly
Stephen and Matt working on it and that
was one reason why I was happy to PG on
the loan because I wanted to put some
more skin in the game because they've
been working hard on it like that
business and this commercial the the one
that we're closing on next week again we
have a less than we have a 10% Equity
stake less than 10% Equity stake in the
the Florida business as well but I'm
excited for us to be a part of these
businesses to leverage our unique skill
set
I really do think once Brian gets up and

[09:01]
I really do think once Brian gets up and
running in Florida for example your cold
calling ability cold Outreach just
ability to grow a customer base is going
to be exceptionally valuable and it's
going to add another qu whatever arrow
in our quiver to Home Services or
Commercial Services my ability as well
to help him transition it like I've been
through multiple Acquisitions I
understand what it takes to to
transition and open new bank accounts
and make sure that you've got your
employees on the right systems y yadada
y so
it's like going to be the highest use of
our unique individual skill sets and
yeah I'm just I'm excited to see how
that turns out the next couple months
and if we never talk about it again
you'll know that they
failed there you go not wrong I think
one of the most interesting things that
I'm seeing right now especially as you
and I are getting into it more on the
content side going to other platforms is
this proliferation of influencers doing
podcasts and the reason I find it
interesting is because it feels like

[10:00]
interesting is because it feels like
they're all getting into this at the
same time so you and I have had this
thesis for a while which is audiences
are incredibly valuable we don't know
how we're going to monetize we don't
know when we're going to monetize we
don't know what it's going to look like
but we know they're infinitely valuable
and we've seen Cody Sanchez start with
an audience where she created a
community and was making a lot of money
she's now gotten into the podcast game
Huber's had a podcast for a long time
and then a flood of influencers quote
unquote have gotten into the podcast
game and the reason I'm finding it
interesting now is because all of the
research and information that we're
learning about podcasts so it's not only
are we seeing it but we also understand
the back end of things and I think your
research on podcasts has been super
fascinating so walk me through again how
do the economics of a podcast work
absolutely so I recently crunched the
numbers on my first million and how much
money they're making and it's actually
not that hard to determine they publicly
state that they get 1.2 million

[11:00]
state that they get 1.2 million
downloads per month Now podcast and
really any online marketing is measured
on a CPM basis cost per Mill and I don't
know who decided to spell thousand as
Mill but I don't make the rules so p on
business podcast the CPM is about
between $40 and
$80 per thousand downloads listeners
Impressions views whatever you want to
call it and so that means if you have an
hourlong podcast and you have three ad
spots and that podcast gets 1,000
downloads it means you can charge call
it 50 bucks per ad slot so
$150 for one podcast that will get a
thousand downloads Lifetime and that has
three ads if you take my first million
and you take those numbers that's 150
times it comes out to like over 200
Grand a month if they were to just sell
ads just ads now think about it this way
Nick companies need to make a 3 to 10x

[12:00]
Nick companies need to make a 3 to 10x
row as return on ad spend on all of
their ads and on Facebook and Google ads
that's very easily measurable but on
podcast it's not and so if let's say
Shopify wants to advertise on my first
million they need to get let's say it's
5x return and so that means they're
getting a million do let's say they
bought out all of my first million's ad
space they would get a million dollar
worth of value out of that $200,000 ad
spend geez Louise so I think why the
Cody Sanchez of the world are getting
into podcasting because they're
realizing I could have my own Shopify I
I could sell my own stuff so 200 Grand a
month is great but a million dollars a
month is better so why even sell ads
when you can launch your own stuff on
your own podcast so me I'm pessimistic
I've always thought even the virtual
Global assistance space I'm like oh it's
getting saturated and you constantly
tell me it's not we're early we're still
we're still early in this game how do
you think about podcasting are we still

[13:00]
you think about podcasting are we still
early in podcasting or is this is it
getting saturated like we see all these
people jumping into it is it just more
earballs or I should say sorry more
people competing for less earballs or is
it are they taking advantage of a
shifting tide is it shifting out of
radio into podcasting what what do you
think about people jumping into it I
can't compete I can't disagree with
myself and I like saying that nothing is
oversaturated right but you can be
oversaturated in a little bubble
where if 13 different people are
launching a business podcast to the same
10,000 people on Twitter then that could
be an oversaturated Niche within that
bubble but it was interesting hearing
Sam par talk about the podcast stats
compared to radio stats because I was
just telling you this a week ago and I
want to tweet about this and oh he's
just copying s par but no we were just
on the same wavelength podcast so 41% of
Americans listen to a podcast month and

[14:00]
Americans listen to a podcast month and
82% of Americans listen to the radio per
month exactly it's still
82% 82% now we know it's shifting it's
slowly podcast is taking market share
away from radio but I don't know like
why would you be a 35y old white dude
launching a podcast to 41% of people
when you could be a 35y old white dude
launching a podcast to 82% of people
yeah okay so we tested this though when
I say we you we we did I did yeah I did
in Tampa in a local radio station last
Friday and I don't know see I don't
that's the hard part about radio like
podcasting because you just don't know
who's listening so I just learned that
radio stations need to pay about $10,000
a month to neelen which is the rating
service that's been around for decades
$10,000 a month for a little old radio
station to know how many people are
listening to their podcast and so this
station that I used in Tampa they don't
pay that she said we broadcast 2 million
residents western Florida and I did the

[15:01]
residents western Florida and I did the
numbers there's 40 podcasts and if 80%
of them listen to a podcast a month
that's 1.6 million and if there's 50
podcasts then that's 60 by 100 I don't
know it's about 10 20 30 40,000 people
potential listeners of your station all
else equal at any given time but I don't
know who heard my podcast and who didn't
last Friday morning in Tampa Bay what I
think is interesting is we had a thesis
you bought a prime hour what was it it
was 9: to 10 right in Tampa seven to
eight Easter and because they don't do e
Neilon we're like okay how do we measure
how many people are actually listening
and so you added a Google phone number
on the ad to say hey if you're listening
to this give me a call did maybe this is
too embarrassing do we get any calls I
have no Pride anymore okay I'm a
37-year-old baby face I've got no I got
zero calls but compare that to Twitter
where I'll tweet about my podcast and

[16:00]
where I'll tweet about my podcast and
it'll get 600,000 views and then I'll
link to the type form asking for
questions which is the the digital
submission version of a phone call and
three people submit out of 600,000
viewers of the Tweet so it doesn't mean
no one heard it it just means people
didn't want to call they didn't have a
question so back to the podcasting 81 I
still can't believe 82% of Americans
listen to the radio once a month that's
nuts but it's 41% for podcasting and so
we're seeing some of these people get
into the mix
as you're looking at somebody like Cody
Sanchez let's just use her as an example
she's done a fantastic job of monetizing
her audience and her reach do you think
she's looking at it as I could spend
money to advertise on podcasts or I
could start my own podcast that's one
way of her thinking about it or do you
think she's just I I just want to
continue to build my brand and this is
another Channel and then it's not
necessarily either or but which one of
those do you think is more of the
motivating factor for her I I assume
she's a extremely calculated but this

[17:00]
she's a extremely calculated but this
was really the only Channel she wasn't
tackling so to me it's probably just a
box she had to check D you know what's
interesting I went and was looking at
her website when was it this week last
week contrarian investor investing
whatever I clicked and I looked at each
one of her portfolio companies really
good and by really good how many times
have you clicked on a website where
you're like five minutes into scrolling
down the page and you still have no idea
what this company does they're using all
kinds of buzzwords they're like the page
looks fantastic it's got a good UI but
you're like okay what do they do exactly
Cody's companies were like really clear
and like top of the the header it's like
we help payment companies lower their
processing fees like it was very clear
with what their value proposition was
and I know this is a stupid observation
to make but just seeing that made me
just reinforce the fact that she's
calculated with stuff I know she gets a
lot of hate on things but I feel like
she's really good about communicating
and that it's just a a really good
branding exercise to go through she's a

[18:02]
branding exercise to go through she's a
killer and it's honestly surprising to
me cuz a few months ago I saw this guy
that just ripped into her on Twitter it
was honestly a very unfair take on her
and it just it broke my heart for her
frankly yeah agreed it wasn't me that
sound familiar was it me be honest yes
of course oh gosh look to the ones of
people who are listen that was your
first viral tweet how how are you
forgetting that it was my first viral
tweet I thought it was I thought you
were going to say it was Sean gorm
because he has like every chance he gets
he just like loves to hate on Cody I
yeah I used to think Cody was a grifter
I really did I thought she was just an
influencer and she was using her
audience to grow and I have gained a
whole new appreciation for her I went
back to like her 2016 interviews and
heard her talk about the way she wants
to get people into entrepreneurship and
I was like dude that's me like she's me
10 years ago she was me and after
listening to those interviews I just
have looked at her in a totally
different length
like I understand the criticism of of

[19:01]
like I understand the criticism of of
her I get that people are saying oh
she's making it look too easy she
whatever you want to say but whatever
your criticisms are she's been the
gateway drug to a lot of people getting
into entrepreneurship and a lot of
people Rave about how they just open her
how she opened their eyes to
entrepreneurship and I can't knock her
after seeing kind of the impact and
effect on people and she's not super
negative she's not out there just doing
clickbait her content is incredibly high
quality like I look at her compared to
Nick Huber Nick's just like engagement
bait as many eyeballs as possible that's
his strategy he's got a huge funnel and
he gets them down and eventually gets
sells them on something but Cody's
content I feel like is consistently
highquality actionable tailored to
entrepreneurs or people looking to get
into entrepreneurship so I was honestly
I was wrong on her and I feel bad about
it it really is good content and I think
it's funny how if you got some guy on
Twitter that says like makes a business
take and no one really looks at it it's
500 views or 5,000 views or whatever and

[20:01]
500 views or 5,000 views or whatever and
then you take that same exact take copy
and paste it to siblin and it gets
500,000 views and it's h you could pick
it apart the math could be wrong when it
gets more views suddenly all the
commenters are like oh what a grifter oh
what are you doing oh this is you're
just saying that because it got more
eyeballs but what about homeboy saying
the same thing with 500 views you've
gone through this the same thing I've
gone through this that happened to me I
posted about pickle ball and I guessed
how much this pickle Place made and this
guy commented a few people commented he
said this is the most dangerous type of
content on Twitter oh my go because he
was insinuating that someone was going
to go spend $800,000 to open a pickle
ball club based on my tweet alone
without doing any research
whatsoever and so I just thought it was
funny because people were jumping on me
because that tweet happened to go viral
if I could predict which tweets would go
viral i' do it all the time I don't know
but that one happened to go viral and so
he got on me because my math was wrong
when I literally said in the Tweet I'm

[21:02]
when I literally said in the Tweet I'm
just guessing back of the napkin got so
well in my mind the thing that makes a
tweet go
viral is the same thing that makes a
tweet a valuable
tweet you leave enough information where
people get the gist but not so much
information that you cover every Bas and
the reason those types of tweets go
viral is because you get the people on
the one hand who are like oh he missed X
Y and Z therefore he's or she's
posting incorrect things or you get
people like you and I who look at it and
are like they left out some stuff I
wonder if this could apply in this area
or that like it causes you to think and
I used to think it was just oh you're
leaving stuff out to attract controversy
and now I'm like no you leave stuff out
to help people fill in the gaps
themselves because they're going to
learn more if they're actually filling
in the gaps versus you filling it in for
them so anyways I just thought that was
really interesting influencers getting
into the podcasting space and especially
since we're getting into podcasting
right now yeah I we have a you and I

[22:01]
right now yeah I we have a you and I
have a mutual friend that went viral
last week and we were texting and
talking about them and I this is what I
said to her I said she was dealing with
some of the haters and wanted advice and
I said all you can do is delete what you
can mute the notifications look down at
your left shoulder PL a big old chip
there refer to that chip daily to prove
the haters Wrong by out success them I
just made that word up they are saying
those things because they hate
themselves eles you just strive to be
the opposite and then I said nothing
would go viral without haters period
every time I have thin skin and I'm
easily offended it's not fun I just mute
as early as possible and focus on that
follower account going up can I tell you
about a rabbit hole I went down yes
please I was just going to ask
you Mr Beast I wanted to know how much
money he's making from his
websites so I did a little did a little
digging did a little digging okay I
placed orders from he so he has two two
kind of Flagship websites Mr beast.

[23:01]
kind of Flagship websites Mr beast.
store and feast.com okay okay feasable
selling chocolate Mr beast. store just
selling vable just chocolate I want you
to it's candy okay other candy too I
want you to guess what his annual sales
are for each store merch and chocolate
Okay so we're talking about two
different stores I'm going to guess
chocolate's more than merch so I'm going
to guess chocolate is somewhere in the
$50 million
sales range and I'm gonna guess merch is
somewhere in the 30 to $40 million sales
range on febles so I I used to own a
company called sends and we shipped food
okay and one thing that we learned at
send eats was that there's not a lot of
food shipped compared to basically any
other category and so I it's not
surprising to me that Feasta is smaller
because they probably do 95% of their
sales in store even in two years a
little over two years he has had over
420,000 orders on febles which at a $30

[24:03]
420,000 orders on febles which at a $30
average order value it's about 13
million hold on hold on how did you find
out his order numbers you just place an
order you look at the order number and
then you go to the web. archive and you
look at when his store was first opened
web archive is basically a an archive of
the internet and so you can see
snapshots almost daily of any website
okay and so I just I subtracted his
order my order number 400
7,604 minus one divided by 730 days two
years it had been open you get 400,000
and so you have to guess the average
order value but I would imagine it's
around 30 bucks so 12 million in
chocolate in two years which is okay
that's impressive but then merch right
are more people buying merch or
chocolate they're buying merch wow that
was way off and so his new store so he
used to have an old store that was
really ugly and so I don't know what
that one did cuz I couldn't place an
order on it okay but his new merch store

[25:02]
order on it okay but his new merch store
hosted on Shopify of course had
770,000 orders in its first five
months what
which merch usually has an aov an
average order value of $50 $39 million
in its not I guess it's not its first
five months under this new website yeah
$39 million so eight8 million a month in
merch dude that is nuts you know what
you didn't calculate in there so eight
yeah we have a friend who works at
Walmart who is I want to
say high up in the on the in the
procurement tra chain and he manages the
feasable
sales the chocolate so what that number
doesn't include that's just direct a
consumer that's not his Walmart
distribution or sales channels right
that's just 13 million directed consumer

[26:00]
that's just 13 million directed consumer
he's probably above the100 million Mark
I said
that you said that I agree I said it was
probably 5% yes oh you didn't you can't
prove that I said it was probably five
5% of his total sales 95% through the
stores jeez Lou he's doing over 10
million a month through two websites
plus who knows what do you think his
margin figures through okay let's add
both of those eight 8 million a month
versus
plus 1 million a month so n let's just
say 10 million a month between his merch
and febles what's his margin his net
margin on that cuz he's probably I would
think his white labing he's somebody
else is doing the Fulfillment somebody
else is doing the purchasing and
procurement and all that other stuff
because he's not running it I don't
think he is he outsources his chocolate
yes to to a factory so yeah but I think
he does his own I don't know if he does
his own fulfillment but I would think
his net margins on chocolate online are
5 to 12% supposedly margin chocolate

[27:02]
5 to 12% supposedly margin chocolate
margins are higher driving brand
awareness is that what you think his
goal is yeah but he has free shipping
and you got to ship that crap you think
his goal is just brand awareness with
this stuff I think that's the bigger
goal I'm sure he's striving to make a
profit online but if you sell a $3
chocolate bar and ship it across the
country there's not really much money to
be made there all right let's talk let's
quit talking about small boy stuff if
you're Mr
Beast what would you do to monetize
you're following you've got billions of
YouTube views I I think I heard one in
seven people in the world watch a video
of his a month something stupid like
that M if you're him what's your move to
monetize what would you do I don't know
that's a good
question it's tough because he he has a
very low value audience an extremely
lowquality audience canell mostly
International very young it's true
cancel me mostly International and very

[28:00]
cancel me mostly International and very
young so the so let me put it this way
if you are Cody
Sanchez her YouTube channel she's
probably making eight
to2 maybe seven to10 for every thousand
views she gets on YouTube okay okay
that's a lot Mr Beast is likely getting
and I know this because I just heard a
podcast with Mark Rober who has a very
similar audience as him he was on how I
built this Mark Rober makes he told
exactly what his CPM is on YouTube it's
about $2.13 so we're talking a quarter
of the value of a business audience I
would think that Mark robber's audience
is even higher value than Mr Beast I bet
it's he has only 15 20% of the followers
I would think that most of them are in
the US a lot of the parents that want
their kids to learn stem skills are
probably middle to upper middle class so
I would think Mr Beast makes like $150
to two bucks per thousand that really
limits what you can sell to your

[29:01]
limits what you can sell to your
audience here's my question how old is
Mr
Beast 26 26 or 25 26 I think what's
interesting is what's his audience going
to be worth in 10 years or 20 years
right if they're all as they age yeah
exactly they're all young they're all
International as those individuals get
to the place where they where we are in
our late 30s and they have more
discretionary earnings and income how
easy is it going to be for him to for
example look at the
Rock I I don't remember what the tequila
brand is that he owns or Kylie Jenner or
Kim Kardashian yeah they're big and then
they pivoted into a brand that Their
audience could actually monetize and
they're now they're both all three of
them are billionaires think about the
power that he might have in 10 or 20
years when he's hey guys you ever heard
of whole life insurance he's not going
to go that route but just like something
of that's high value that his Audi that
depends on high trust that he can then

[30:01]
depends on high trust that he can then
monetize with his audience so I think
he's being smart like he's not poor by
any stretch but he's also got that
30-year
mindset whereas other people are just
they're just trying to make videos to be
funny he's building an audience for the
long term which is super interesting
yeah you asked me how I would make money
if I were him I don't know if I could do
it better than him when I hear of all
the things he's doing transcribing his
YouTube video like he has channels in
every country I'm exaggerating he you
know what I'm saying he does all these
things has
philanthropy to spread his footprint I
don't know what I could do better than
him he's got that dog in him dude he
is I love
it all right so you do love that you
love that I do love that I I told Chris
I wake up in the morning and I piss
excellence I tell you
what I'm talking about it's your boy no
I was telling Chris that in the morning
as I wake up and I'm my kids run in my
room and I'm like
I got that dog in me and they laugh is

[31:01]
I got that dog in me and they laugh is
that a bird or a dog you don't get it
you don't get it all right I saw this
tweet this week it was from Chris
Hoffman otherwise known as St Louis
Chris and he had three categories he
said what's the hardest phase of growth
0 to 1 million 1 million to 10 million
or 10 million to 100 million now I do
think that each one of those could have
like different subcategories but I gave
an answer and I'm curious to get your
perspective what do you think is the
hardest phase of growth 0 to 1 million 1
million to 10 million 10 million to 100
1 to 10 why do you say that so it's
funny I don't know if I'll have time to
get to this today but last night I I
couldn't sleep and for some reason I
decided to I have a a Google sheet
called every business I've ever started
and it was at like 39 or 40 last night
right now it's at s it's at 70 and so
I've been to that zero to 1 million
phase SE yeah 70

[32:00]
phase SE yeah 70
businesses so we can talk about that
later but my point is I've been in that
Zer to one million phase 70 times and so
I know it pretty well so it doesn't seem
as hard to me yeah but 1 to 10 man
that's that's when everything breaks you
got to be good to get past 10 yeah you
gotta be really good for me what I
answered was I think it's different for
every person for me the zero to one
million is the hardest
like just personally I could take a
business from 1 to 10 but for me 0o to
one is the hardest because it requires a
different skill set that's just not
innately me I think you have a skill set
that is innately you but I ended it by
say I ended it two ways I said I would
say 0 to one my business partner would
say 1 to 10 so I called it on you but I
think it's got to objectively be 10 to
100 right because the smallest
percentage of businesses are in the the1
to1 million range if you're just looking

[33:00]
to1 million range if you're just looking
at at a filtering mechanism and you said
okay what's the smallest statistically
speak how you it's got to be the the 10
to 100 but like we just haven't played
in the 10 to 100 ballpark for that long
like we're in the middle we're in that
ball park right now but it's new to us
like we're figuring it out and maybe two
years three years from now we'll have a
different perspective but it's just
statistically just got to be that right
yeah I think I I like using Mark
Zuckerberg as an analogy because to take
something from zero to a trillion has
how many times has that been done Sergey
and Larry pagee didn't do it Bezos did
it how you have to have all the skills
right you have to have every single
skill and the caliber of employees you
need from 0 to one from 1 to 10 and to
from 10 plus the caliber that the
founder needs the co-founders the
executive team it's completely different
how do you have all of those skills you
just have to learn as you go and be
really good at it yeah and Zucker has
done there's a reason why Venture
Capital companies will invest in a

[34:00]
Capital companies will invest in a
founder and then replace that founder at
a certain point to get them to the next
level dude that's such an interesting
that's a tweet right there how many
Founders have gone from zero to a
trillion like probably there's only
three I can think of
Bezos it's mine Zuckerberg it's my tweet
yeah I know M mine mine Bezos Zuckerberg
I wouldn't even say I wouldn't say Larry
and Sergey because like they no I I said
they they didn't do it oh okay they
bounced musk has has Tesla hit a
trillion yep oh yeah they they touched
it okay and then they came back yeah man
that is that's a really cool Insight but
like you said different skill sets at
different time periods this could be a
100x difference are we talking zero to
let's say a billion market cap or sales
because if you're Facebook you can have
a billion dollar market cap with $10
million sales right so it's like the
difference between like mining Syndicate
got to 10 million really quick we didn't
have a billion dollar valuation but I'm
pretty sure Facebook did have a billion

[35:00]
pretty sure Facebook did have a billion
dollar valuation they had a billion
dollar valuation before they had a
dollar of Revenue and it made sense and
looking back it was the right call yeah
I think the but valuation and sales are
two very different things I think the
only other company that comes close to
that
is do you know what lvmh's market cap is
that's that's Louis Vuitton that's the
only other one that I can think of but
even through that he didn't go from zero
to a trillion he went from 10 million 50
million to a trillion still an
incredible run
they are no they're only a $430 billion
market cap never mind I take it back I
guess aramco is the only other trillion
dollar company I can think of that's not
a tech company mhm I love rollups
specifically rollups in the private
Equity space
and I think it'd be fun to talk about on
a weekly basis just rollup of the week
but before I talk about the rollup of
the week that I think is really
interesting I want to take a second to
just explain what Roll-Ups are because I
think people talk about about them but I
don't know that they actually know what

[36:01]
don't know that they actually know what
they are and I've been a part of some
Roll-Ups so I have some experience here
you got fruit roll up you got cheesy
rollups cheesy what else okay so first
you take a hot
dog wrap it with some jack cheese put it
in a pizza now you got cheesy
blasters you got cheesy blasters 30 Rock
reference there anyways so rollups work
for two reasons one the first reason is
economies of scale so like with any
business as you grow you get economies
of scale so think of a a dental practice
by itself they have one person doing
accounts payable and they also do
payroll and they also do billing and
they also do Collections and they do
authorizations so they have one person
who does all the administrative
functions they're not exceptional any
one of them but they're proficient at
all of them right then you roll up two
three four five six Dental practices
together and you can hire for
specialization and you can hire for

[37:00]
specialization and you can hire for
skill and at the same time you can lower
your administrative cost because you
have one person who's able to take on
their limit their Max without it being
at just one location right so there's
efficiencies that you realize with the
economy is a scale drives down the
administrative overhead but the second
thing that is really good about rollups
is leverage so for most businesses under
a million dollars in iida they will sell
from anywhere between three and five
times iida so you you have a let's just
say $500,000 hbac company that's going
to sell for anywhere between 1.5 and
$2.5 million with each EAA
threshold the number goes up because
essentially effectively what you're
saying is below a million dollars I'm
willing to pay or willing to make the
bet that within five years I'll pay back
my investment so it's a little bit risky
right it's it's only five years that's
all I'm willing to pay once you get
above a million so a million to 2.5
million then all of a sudden the even
range changes from 3 to 5 to say 4 to 7

[38:01]
range changes from 3 to 5 to say 4 to 7
so now what they're saying is this is a
more established business I'm willing to
bet that it'll be around for seven years
it's the Lindy effect in the real world
then you go to the the2 and a half to $5
million multiple uh eida range and
you're looking at 10 times iida that
business is worth because they think
it's going to be around for at least 10
years they'll be able to get their
investment back so what these companies
do their thesis is en rolling up is they
will leverage debt and they'll go by
five $1 million eida agencies or
companies and so each one of them
combined is $5 million at 5x so 5 Time 5
they spent $25 million to get five
companies um doing $1 million a piece
now they've all combined so the EA does
$5
million so they're in a different
multiple range now they can go and sell
that Upstream to a private Equity
company for 10 times IAA so they they
bought all those companies for 25
million they can now sell it for 50

[39:01]
million they can now sell it for 50
million and they achiev this thing
called multiple Arbitrage right it's the
difference between those two things and
if you don't believe me you can go look
at the public markets all these publicly
traded companies you look at the priced
earnings ratio 15 to 20 to 25 for
high-flying tech companies it's in the
dozens or
hundreds but that multiple is really
what drives these rollups that's so
that's why you see rollups unquote as
being really sexy especially in the
private Equity world did I explain that
okay yeah and honestly it's the same
thing that we're doing in RV parks right
now we're buying RV car caps at a 10 to
11 cap we're adding value to where it's
like a 15 cap looking back and then
hopefully one day private Equity comes
knocking and wants to pay a five or a
six cap because they're buying the
entire package and it has a nice little
bow on it and it's vertically integrated
it has all the management Under One Roof
yeah so I love the RO space Nick because
I look at it like Home Services there's

[40:01]
I look at it like Home Services there's
500 different Home Service verticals
people ones that people have never
thought of right you've got gutter
install gutter cleaning Seamless Gutters
gutter guards gutter removal like just
in gutter guards just in one little
niche there's 10 different Industries
and so I love Home Services because
there are so many industries that
there's hundreds of them that no one's
even thought of starting yet and I look
at rollups the same way where it's like
all right what are we going to roll
apartment buildings okay cool mobile
home parks okay cool Dental hey everyone
goes to the dentist twice a year Dent
doctor's offices then it gets more Niche
like OBGYNs fertility clinics in vitro
clinics and it gets more and more Niche
and there's no end so there's still
hundreds if not thousands of random
little verticals like marinas or sheds
like used sheds new sheds that could be
rolled up that no one's even thought of
yet so the current one that I'm that I
think is really interesting right now
you've met Dev Shaw Dev and I have
connected a lot on Twitter he's going to

[41:01]
connected a lot on Twitter he's going to
acquire. comom and he's finding SAS
companies in particular educational SAS
companies that are targeted at college
students so he's got like a very limit
not limited but like strict criteria and
he is buying those they're doing less
than $110,000 a year usually in AR and
he's buying them and then he's what he's
been doing is he's rolling them together
realizing some economies of scale and
has grown them so he's bought several of
these where beforehand they were doing
anywhere of I don't know $2,000 a month
in net income and now because he's
rolled them up he's doing $7,500 a month
in net income to himself so he's cross-
sold because they have different
customers on each one of the different
platforms but they're pretty much the
same customer profile that you're going
to want to sell to for each of them so
he's cross sold but he's also through
his Network sold into different
universities and grown the product as

[42:00]
universities and grown the product as
well so is it going to be a billion
dollar company no I don't think so but
it's been really cool to see him
profitably grow and monetize these
through the rollup strategy and I I
think he'll have an exit someday which
obviously will be a lot better than what
he paid for them but he's got like more
of a cash flow rollup strategy that I
think's been super interesting yeah I
love it because it's just you perfect
the model and then you just keep copying
pasting and it gets really exciting
along the way so I tweeted about it's
about you great golf in stadiums just
kidding of course it's about I so I
tweeted the the coolest Biz IDE I've
heard this month play rounds of golf
inside your favorite stadiums for $80
they're slammed with theand I'm working
on getting the owner on my podcast to
pick his brain swap out golf with
anything else you've got even more
business ideas here I love this because
Sports is beloved by all and stadiums
hold such a nostalgic feel in our hearts
yeah and I think feel like you could
take anything that's just very plain and

[43:00]
take anything that's just very plain and
basic and put it in a stadium like the
Portlandia episode you put a bird on it
put it in a stadium and you'll sell five
10 times the tickets so I think that
someone could crush doing like tough
mutters maybe not exactly a tough mutter
but that type of a fitness challenge
inside of a stadium you could do like a
gourmet food market like a pop-up
Farmers Market inside a stadium that'll
be every second Saturday or or something
in the spring yeah you could do have you
ever seen like those traveling bounce
houses that they'll put up in like a
huge parking lot yeah and I say bounce
house but it's two acres big and kids
just have a field day you could do one
of those inside a stadium I feel like
people think it's harder than it
actually is to just get the stadium
manager on the phone and say how much to
use your stadium for a few hours I feel
like people don't do this business
because it's insurmountable to them but
it's probably just a phone call the one
thing I thought about as I was looking
at your Tweet was like are

[44:00]
at your Tweet was like are
they is there going to be a lot of
damage from those golf
balls cuz if if I'm this if I'm the
stadium owner I'm worried about the turf
and I'm worried about the facilities so
is it going to do anything to damage it
that's one potential downside but then I
thought how cool would it be to have a
game of
tag how cool would it be to have a Nerf
gun war if you there's this place near
my house called nerfed mhm I thought it
was dumb at first before I actually went
with my kids but it's just this big
warehouse and you play Nerf and you pick
up the bullets that are on the ground
it's the honor System right you got to
call yourself out but like a big game of
Nerf Capture the Flag laser tag like
these
big events that you could have with
people
competing in these stadiums I think
would be so fun imagine getting a
hundred of your best friends and renting
out the stadium for three hours and you
guys just go and play laser tag would be
like it would be incredible I just don't
know if the stadi want to have that Tye
of liability I feel like there's always

[45:00]
of liability I feel like there's always
going to be a business model for
charging parents 10 to 20 bucks to drop
their kids off somewhere where they have
a lot of fun in a unique way I don't
feel like that's ever going away and
this would be that there was this place
in Alabama yeah there's this place in
Alabama it's the most Alabama thing ever
there was just this strip mall with this
little store that had four bounce houses
inside of it and you just walk in and
give some guy an overalls five bucks and
your kids just start bouncing and you
come back and pick them up hey Terry I'm
going drop my kids off to bounce and
then I'mma bounce I'll see you in two
hours Terry you're good hey are you
allowed to be this close to a school
Terry I'm just going to go ahead and say
it I'm noticing that this is not within
50 yards of an elementary school is that
purposeful what do you think Nick should
we call it yeah let's call it this was
fun I I think I'm Gonna Save My I'm
saving my business ideas now for this
once a week conversation that we
have two birs with one stone let's do it
