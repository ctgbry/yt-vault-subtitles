[00:00]
high-end toilets that are $823 each.
Well, this whole deal sold for 750 bucks
and there's 10 of them. This is such a
small risk. A member that's in
Sacramento, they started buying just
pressure washers, sold 600 of them, but
just 10 days ago, he bought his first
truckload of outdoor furniture, patio
furniture. Recoup the truckload
investment and hit profit territory in
the first 36 hours. We're going to make
a $100,000 profit. They give away
ambulances, dude. Really? Hell yeah.
Firet trucks, too. firet trucks. Full
electric buses sold for between 2500 and
$25,000. You could start a business just
finding buyers for these.
&gt;&gt; Don't sit there and watch stupid reels.
These opportunities are out there, man.
Oh, there's a million reasons not to do
any of this stuff, but you're missing
out on the opportunity.
Two months ago, I had my friend Shannon
on the podcast right here. It was one of
my most popular videos ever. He shared a
screen and we went shopping for
liquidation items. Shannon has been
buying and selling and liquidating
overstock and returns for decades. He is

[01:00]
overstock and returns for decades. He is
the best in the biz, the good friend,
and he's been on this podcast like 12 or
13 times, and you guys just love it when
he shares his screen, goes shopping on
these liquidation sites, and explains
what he sees and where the opportunity
is. So, we did it again. From furniture
to wooden toys to flight simulators,
there's something for everyone today.
Enjoy.
&gt;&gt; I want to talk about boring stuff for a
minute, though, cuz I think it's so
good. This is a company called Winston
Water Cooler, right? Which I've never
heard of, but they sell plumbing
supplies and bathroom things. So, this
deal, the best part about this deal, I'm
pointing at my screen, you can't see me.
The best part about this deal is nobody
put any effort into that title.
&gt;&gt; It just says one pallet of plumbing
fixtures. Okay. I'm like, "Oh, that's
weird."
&gt;&gt; And that's a signal. That's a signal to
dive in because it means other people
aren't.
&gt;&gt; Yes. Exactly. cuz you're like, "Oh,
that's boring. I don't want to buy pipe
and plumbing fixtures that connect that
pipe, but I do want to buy high-end
toilets that are $823 each and $787

[02:03]
toilets that are $823 each and $787
each, 700, 600, 520 colers. If you look
up these toilets, these are very I think
750 was the best price I found for this
Caro, you know, whatever. KO2 toilet."
Well, this whole deal sold for 750
bucks. 50 bucks a unit.
&gt;&gt; $50 for $800 toilets
&gt;&gt; and there's 10 of them. They're not all
800 bucks, but the cheapest one's 150,
right? And so I always harp on do your
research, figure this stuff out. But
this is such a small risk to get into
this business. And if you know anybody,
especially that's a house flipper,
remodeler, contractor, whatever, or even
just selling these on Facebook
Marketplace, I think you could sell them
for half off and, you know, make
yourself three $4,000.
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; no problem. And because nobody knows who
Winston Water Cooler is, and this is a
big mistake. This would be like you
trying to sell it. This is, you know,

[03:00]
trying to sell it. This is, you know,
you have to have all the great detail in
your product listing, right? Because
that's the SEO, your keywords and all
that stuff. So, I love this deal and um
any deal like this, it's fantastic.
&gt;&gt; Oh, so good. You could list these on
Facebook Marketplace before even
bidding.
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.
&gt;&gt; See if there's demand.
&gt;&gt; Yep. And these deals are available every
day. The product is not the most
important part of this whole scenario.
It's it's the process, right? The
systems and getting it figured out. So,
&gt;&gt; I love this deal. There's another one
that this one. Okay. One pallet of pipe
valve fittings. It's $27,775
their price. They're they're a
distributor. They don't even I don't
think they have a wholesaler or retail,
but it sold for 1,500 bucks. So, there's
256 units. It's brand new. If you're in
this business, this could be, you know,
one of the best money makers that you've
that you found. It's incredible. I
really like the boring stuff because
there's less competition to buy it

[04:00]
there's less competition to buy it
because I think human nature is we're
kind of attracted to the shiny, you
know, sexy stuff. But things like patio
furniture, carpets, once Costco started
selling, you know, ruggable, the the
rugs you could throw in the washer,
which is a big game. Once they started
selling those for four or 500 bucks, it
changed the whole carpet because you've
got like a branded carpet now, which
better than, you know, just some
no-name, you know, carpet. I still love
pressure washers if you're mechanically
inclined. I think there's a big upside
to there. And I love seasonality. like
right now buying outdoor stuff and
Blackstones and stuff for the lake and
all that kind of stuff that the prices
to buy have started to dip because we're
headed into fall and and all that kind
of stuff. So those kind of things I'm
I'm real excited about. I still love
industrial stuff, things that like
plumbing stuff, HVAC stuff, but it takes
a little more sophistication. So again,
it's another moat that you're that is
around that kind of auction. And it's

[05:00]
around that kind of auction. And it's
the same with once you can get up to
buying truckloads at a time, it totally
changes everything because you've
eliminated probably 99% of the people
that are just getting started. You
always want to build a moat around you
want to be the only buyer if you can.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You know, so it's it's uh it's really
cool. So boring products and we're going
to talk about some of those boring
products today. We've got some sexy
stuff mixed in too because that's always
fun. But yeah, it's cool. Okay, I want
to start off just something really
simple that's so easy. Everybody has a
target near them. Everybody can see what
they sell. It's really basic, but a lot
of people miss it. And so, let's just
talk about this small deal. Five pallets
train tracks, right? Sets and there's
some other stuff, too. But these train
tracks are like wooden train sets and uh
has little houses and farm and all that
kind of stuff around them, you know, for
little kids to play. 240 units. What I
love is when you can jump on the Target
like website and see they're still
selling this train set for 129. So 130

[06:02]
selling this train set for 129. So 130
bucks. You can't sell it for that,
right? Because you're not Target. But
and when I searched eBay and and a few
other places for sold listings about 80
or $90, right?
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; And these are brand new. You know, their
Target 21,598 was their total price. It
sold for $2,600.
So your cost on these things is 11
bucks. $118 a unit. What time of the
year is it? Right. It's September. So,
you know, we're getting there. Yeah,
we're getting there. You didn't buy You
buy these, you're not going to get them
for two, couple two, three weeks anyway.
You're going to be into October. People
are going to, you know, all of a sudden
you're going to be into the holidays.
It's just a really simple, nice deal.
You could sell on Facebook Marketplace.
You could put these on eBay because it's
a box. You could ship out. You could you
could do it anywhere. You could you
could live sell these things. just
really basic here and very low risk,
right? I'm gonna pay $11. Target's still
selling them for $130.

[07:01]
selling them for $130.
&gt;&gt; I feel pretty safe that maybe even if
you had to sell them for 50 or 60 bucks,
you're going to make $40 a unit and
you're going to, you know, you have a
couple hundred of them, so we're going
to make $8,000.
&gt;&gt; I've never even heard of these brands.
This looks pretty high quality, though.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. You know, hearth and hand, I guess
it is. Yeah. And they have all kinds of
wooden toys and I love that. I think
parents love this stuff. It's not
plastic. You put it in there and you
know you could be a rockstar selling
these things for 60 70 bucks as we get
closer to Christmas.
&gt;&gt; So So I love I like this deal. Super
simple.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I just looked up Hearth and Hand
on Google Trends. Y
&gt;&gt; this is what I see. It's climbing in
popularity and
&gt;&gt; That's nice. Yeah. I love that, dude.
&gt;&gt; Incredible. Incredibly seasonal.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; Which is what we're after right right
now.
&gt;&gt; And I couldn't tell you why. Like if I
had to target, you know, purchasing
people on this show, my question would
be like, why are you guys liquidating
this? And I will tell you, like I toured
a couple weeks ago the 100,000 square

[08:00]
a couple weeks ago the 100,000 square
foot returns facility for some of these
large, very large companies. And you
know what their main concern is? Getting
this stuff out the door because that
there's over a thousand pallets inside
this facility. The only thing they are
worried about, we have 50 60 trucks
coming on Thursday. We have to get this
stuff out, you know, and they're also
worried, they want to be good stewards
of the environment. So, they need this
has to be part of their story that, hey,
all these returns, these things, we all
find homes for them. They don't wind up
in landfill, you know, that kind of
thing. The other interesting thing I
learned is that much of what they're
selling, like Target may not even, well,
this is kind of not a good example, but
some of these uh higher dollar items are
just shipped direct from the
manufacturer. Like if you buy a bathtub
from Costco on their e-commerce site,
it's coming right from Coler or whoever
it is, and lots of times those things
just can't be delivered. Something
happens, people aren't there, whatever.
Things change. Well, that product

[09:00]
Things change. Well, that product
doesn't go back to Colar and that
product doesn't go back to like Costco
for example in this case. You know, that
product goes to a returns warehouse even
though it's brand new and get sold
because they're just trying to move.
It's too expensive for them
&gt;&gt; and there's nothing wrong with it.
&gt;&gt; They're brand new. Brand new. And on
e-commerce returns are 20 to 30% of
every purchase.
Every single thing is 20 to 30% and it's
growing year-over-year. Right? So
companies like Betock, they're just set
up and they have such good credibility
that they're just handling this stuff
and they know
&gt;&gt; they want to protect the supplier,
whether it's a manufacturer, a retailer,
and they want these buyers to have good
experiences. And so, yeah, it's crazy.
It's right in front of you, this
opportunity. These deals are every
single day. We're going to look at deals
today that have like no bids, no no one
buying them. It's ridiculous. It's
ridiculous. As long as people are
consumers, there will be deals.
&gt;&gt; Yes, of course.
&gt;&gt; Real quick, please subscribe to my
channel. I know it's kind of lame to

[10:00]
channel. I know it's kind of lame to
ask, but it means a lot. Thanks.
&gt;&gt; You know, Costco sells $250 billion
worth of inventory a year, and Costco's
e-commerce is just getting started.
They're just sinking billions of
dollars. This is just going to grow.
Target, you know, they're I think
they're way ahead of Costco on the
e-commerce front. So, just going to go,
go, go, go. I also really love
seasonality. Let me show you this this
deal. It's a Costco deal. No surprise
there. It's three pallets of Big Joe. Uh
if you've seen those things floating
around pools, these are pool hammocks,
which is really cool. I happen to have
one. Brand new. It's only 39 units, so
it's not something that's going to, you
know, you're not going to become a
millionaire, but it's just going to add
to your inventory. Costco was selling
them for 1,560 bucks. They're the
cheapest around because they're
obviously only making 14% profit margin.
And they normally sold them for 40
bucks. They sold for 11 bucks at this at
today at this auction. So 1,560 bucks,
$429. I wouldn't buy these because as

[11:02]
$429. I wouldn't buy these because as
you can see the shipping is a little
high. I'm in California. These are in
Maryland. I would buy closer to home.
&gt;&gt; But just a great product to see. And you
know, you get to see you've got the
original. This is pulled right from the
floor.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. They're not returns.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, they're not returns. Everything's
brand new. Terrific product to add to
your Facebook Marketplace stuff. You
might have to sit on it over, you know,
the winter as things go or if you're in
Florida where people are swimming all
year long. I love these deals. Simple,
boring. There's nothing to test. There's
nothing to break.
&gt;&gt; There's nothing that's going to fail
when the customer gets it that they're
going to get upset at you about. like,
you know,
&gt;&gt; yeah,
&gt;&gt; I was in the watch business and I had
people return watches cuz when they were
on the plane, they would say, "Oh, the
altimter's off."
&gt;&gt; It was a nightmare, you know? I was
like, I can't I can't be in this
business, dude. I just, you know, so I
love this this stuff. It, you know,
talking about just returns furniture.

[12:00]
talking about just returns furniture.
Incredible.
&gt;&gt; I like the seasonal stuff because it
removes some of the question mark from
what you're buying because if you're
buying something that's not seasonal,
it's like, all right, what's wrong with
this? Is this color just off? People
hate the color for whatever reason,
right? But when it's seasonal, it's like
the hardest thing for any retailer to do
is to predict demand, right? Inventory
management is a nightmare whether you
have a million dollar business or a
billion dollar business.
&gt;&gt; And so we're buying these pool floaties.
It's like they order too many.
&gt;&gt; That's the problem. There's no problem.
They just order too many.
&gt;&gt; And I imagine it's the same with like
the trains, you know, whatever. They
have some projection. They made somebody
made somebody made an error.
&gt;&gt; One thing I see people doing really,
really well with is furniture. And I
think because it's harder to handle, you
know, you've got to have when I say
harder to handle, I'm talking physically
because you've got to have a couple of
people that are going to help you move
around. But so I just pulled up these
examples of a few. This is the Costco
wholesale auction site, truckload of
upholstered furniture and dining, you
know, 11 whole sets. The Costco price,
which is a far more trusted price than

[13:02]
which is a far more trusted price than
another retailer that might be
discounting these at half off or
something like that, Costco price was
11,440
bucks. It sold this morning for $585.
This is an entire truckload of couches,
dining furniture, and there these are
customer returns, AB grade. So, this is
in College Park, Georgia. You can see
there's some manufacturer pictures.
There's a huge couple of sofas. I do get
a little concerned of lighter colors. I
I would say that customer returns you
you're going to have less cleaning up
things than on a darker color. Here is
the you know they're shrink some of them
are you know they're all shrink wrapped
on these pallets. So you get to see what
you're buying. I literally walked
through warehouses full of this stuff
the other day. Nice that they're wrapped
up. Couple of love seats. Dining room
chairs. These look like high high level
chairs. So they're trying to give you as
much information as you can. Two big
giant I don't know what they are. It

[14:00]
giant I don't know what they are. It
might be an ice chest inside this thing.
But you know, you get to see all the
actually what you're going to buy,
right? An entire truckload of this
product.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Coming in looks nice. You can zoom
in. Take a look back here. But the whole
thing, you know, sold $53
on average per unit. And so you can look
at the Costco price. First line item
$2,100. Second,
&gt;&gt; oh my gosh,
&gt;&gt; $1,900.
&gt;&gt; This is Costco. 1,700,500,
1300. It's
&gt;&gt; The opportunity in furniture and heavy
items is insane. It's just a really
good, you know, product line. There is a
Let me talk to you about another
company.
&gt;&gt; Well, especially if it's nearby you,
right? And you don't have to pay for
that freight.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. If it's close to you, you know,
you're obviously going to going to look
as close as you can. Costco has
distribution centers all over that
they're doing this. But I would also say
don't get too hung up on the shipping if
the numbers still make sense. If you

[15:00]
the numbers still make sense. If you
calculated and did some research and
said, "Okay, Costco was selling this for
11. I think I could sell it for, you
know, eight and you could pay 500, but
shipping was 2,000." Well, it's kind of
irrelevant. Would you invest $2,500 to
make, you know, sell it for eight so you
can make 5,500 bucks? So that that's the
way I kind of look at it. Freight is
just part of the cost of goods that
you're buying.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So
&gt;&gt; yeah,
&gt;&gt; we talked about this brand last time.
This is Walker Edison. If you recall,
they wanted like the online version of
IKEA.
&gt;&gt; They've just recently started blowing
outdoor furniture.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; Seasonal.
&gt;&gt; Yep. Love seats. This kind of stuff.
Nice. Good chairs, all this kind of
stuff. Okay, you see it all flat packed
in the box. Easy to store. I love this
stuff. There's their warehouse. Couple
things. So, this is 16 pallets. They
basically going to This is a truckload.
Basically, 250 units. They're priced.

[16:02]
Basically, 250 units. They're priced.
You know, retail they're saying it's
123,824
bucks. I don't see them doing massive
discounts, but let's just be super
conservative and use my the retail price
is a lie rule and just cut that in half.
So, it's like, okay, let's just say
you're going to sell it for $60,000 or
that's the price. Can you sell it for
60? I don't probably not because you're
not them. This auction sold for $7,240.
Okay, it this was on I saved this
because it was such a good deal and I
wanted to talk about it today. So,
you're into this, you're going to be
into it for about $10,000 with shipping
because a truckload, let's just say it's
three grand on the top. So, if half the
retail is 60 grand, you paid 10, you
can't sell it for 60. Could you sell it
for half of that again for 30?
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; Probably.
&gt;&gt; And so, you're going to make a $10,000
investment.
&gt;&gt; You're going to create incredible
content, time-lapse videos of you

[17:01]
content, time-lapse videos of you
putting together this sample stuff.
Again, it's seasonal things, so you may
have to hang on to it. But how long is
it going to take you to get your 10
grand back? That's that's the most
important question you have to ask
yourself. Definitely.
&gt;&gt; Oh, man.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But I would definitely look at
this. This is one of these boring
categories. And if we click in here, I
don't know if they have anything else
listed today. Yeah. This is So, their
auctions ended a few days ago. Within
the next couple days, they'll have more
stuff. How many people do you know are
like buying a pallet or two and then
buying a few pallets and buying a
truckload and then like starting like a
retail store or or like a local
reputation for selling stuff like this
versus like onesie twoosie just kind of
flipping this stuff on Facebook
Marketplace.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's the path. It's starting on
Facebook Marketplace and then capturing
that data, right? And capturing those
customers when they come over. You
should be talking to them and hey, what
else do you buy? Can I get your email?
Can I email you when I get a shipment of
stuff? You you want to run it like a
business. Even if you're thinking, "Oh,

[18:00]
business. Even if you're thinking, "Oh,
I just need to make five grand a month."
I have a member that's in Sacramento.
They started buying just pressure
washers 10 months ago. He sold 600 of
them since then in that 10-month period.
This was a guy that never even used a
pressure washer, but just about 10 days
ago, he bought his first truckload of
outdoor furniture, patio furniture.
Okay. and he says, "Okay, I'm getting it
in." He's talking about it. I can see
it. And I posted about this on X. Within
24 hours of getting it, he'd gotten he
sold about 70% got 70% of his investment
back.
&gt;&gt; Within 72 hours, he was profitable. And
that deal's gone. He sold it. It's gone.
And this is a guy like wheeling stuff
into his backyard.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; He's posting like warehouse. Ton of
money.
&gt;&gt; No. Yeah. He He's like, "Oh, I got to
improve my gate so I can get pallets
back here." And he's posting and doing
this kind of thing. So, this is how it
starts. See these pictures? This is
guy's front yard. I mean, they're
bringing them right in here. This guy

[19:01]
bringing them right in here. This guy
did a sale right here. He's talking
about This is It's just incredible data
for me.
&gt;&gt; On Monday, they started posting.
Couldn't get anybody to come out in this
garage sale. Started posting in Facebook
groups. Do we have this? The phone
started ringing. They had a $2,000 day
on Labor Day selling stuff out of their
driveway.
&gt;&gt; Pressure washers or other stuff?
&gt;&gt; Furniture and this kind of stuff. This
is his stuff. Mainly mainly patio
furniture.
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Selling that kind of stuff.
&gt;&gt; I just can't get over the fact that he
sold 600 pressure washers in Sacramento.
Like what?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. This is Joe. Record setting month.
Total sales $17,000. 85 pressure
washers. 65% of the truckload because he
did he had just got in recoup the
truckload investment and hit profit
territory in the first 36 hours and he's
like now I don't have anything to sell
so he's he's back at buying it but this
is so to answer your question then Joe
is coming he's like hey we we've set a
goal we're going to make $100,000 profit

[20:01]
goal we're going to make $100,000 profit
in 2026 with this business and that's
how you do it you scale it up in the
beginning he's posting about you know I
don't know anything about some of these
pressure washers are broken how do I fix
it? And he didn't know how to fix it, so
he found somebody to help him. It's all
about problem solving, right? And here's
another guy. Crazy week, two loads of
furniture, appliances, Blackstone, few
picks. I'll have to run the numbers
Tuesday, I guess. 80% sold in less than
three days. That's freaking exciting to
me, man. I love this stuff.
&gt;&gt; Where are these guys using? Facebook
Marketplace.
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; that's it. Yeah,
&gt;&gt; mainly. Yeah, that's all they're using.
There's no This is simple.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. The same with the pressure
washers. Yeah. Facebook Marketplace.
Yeah, absolutely, dude. Yeah, this guy's
coming up with building an AI tool to
put for take pictures. Look at it. You
know, just won my first auction at 500
bucks. I can flip the two chairs for 750
a piece. Costco price was 1150, retail
15. You know, I basically returned the
entire investment including shipping. I
love it. I got my first one. So, yeah,

[21:01]
love it. I got my first one. So, yeah,
it's super exciting, man, to watch these
people. This guy just got in two two
pallets, bathroom and kitchen fixtures,
home lighting. Every picture you see
here is somebody's garage. You know,
it's just somebody just starting out and
then watching you scale and scale. And
if you're going to get it,
&gt;&gt; you can't get a truckload delivered to
your garage. You have to use a freight
forwarder and then they'll break it up
and bring you smaller pallets because
you can't get a full semi-truck in the
into your residential area and you know,
so I love it. I absolutely love seeing
it because I know it works because I've
done it for so long. And seeing these
people really figure it out,
&gt;&gt; it's super rewarding, man. I love it,
&gt;&gt; man. I want to go move the van right now
and load up my garage with power.
&gt;&gt; I know. It gets me. It gets me very
excited.
&gt;&gt; All right, guys. You know, I'm always
looking for ways to help you make more
money with less effort. Well, High Level
is, too. And I think that's why I like
it so much. While everyone else out
there is switching between 10 different
apps, HighLevel puts everything in one
clean dashboard. You can send emails,

[22:00]
clean dashboard. You can send emails,
track leads, build funnels, schedule
appointments, everything. And no more
logging into a bunch of different
platforms. Your clients think you're
some tech wizard when really all you did
is stop making things so complicated.

Link below if you want to see what I
mean. If you use that link, they'll give
you a 30-day free trial. Super boring.
Here's the pictures. Take a look. Now,
you know, whoever bought it could really
know and go, "Oh, yeah, that price is
way inflated." But that's why they only
paid $5.86 a unit. So, don't fall for
this this MSRP. You have to research the
market price because that's all that
matters. And it could be seasonal. It
could be, you know, and I would never
recommend this for somebody just getting
started because I think you would just
sit on this product because you don't
know who to sell it to. But what you do
is you print out these manifests right
here. You can download the whole thing
and you just share it with people that
you know. Say, "Hey, you're in this
business. What's this stuff really
worth?" And a guy comes back and says,

[23:00]
worth?" And a guy comes back and says,
"Oh, 27,000 is a joke.
it's only worth like five grand. Go,
okay, great. Then you work it backwards.
You always start at the sales side and
work these deals backwards. You should
know exactly what you're going to sell
this product for before you place any
bids, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And and you're, you know, super great at
that stuff with like testing on Facebook
Marketplace and everything else, but
this is definitely who's in your
network, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; for sure. For sure. This is interesting.
I I found this is kind of interesting.
This is this is a gov deals auction.
Obviously, you need to invest a little
bit more money and you need to have a
little bit more knowledge. But these are
Tesla superchargers, the kind on the
side of the road that you plug your
Tesla into. It's the whole thing.
There's six of them in this lot. It's
not just the white whatever that is. I
don't know anything about this here, but
it's the stuff you need to support.
&gt;&gt; Mhm. all the support products, these
big, you know, white boxes of whatever
it is that you see parked, you see like

[24:00]
it is that you see parked, you see like
one of these and then there's like six
or seven test superchargers. So, that
includes the big transformer or whatever
it is.
&gt;&gt; It's the whole thing, everything. You
get all the details. They give you
close-up pictures of all this stuff. All
this stuff. And
&gt;&gt; what would you even do with this? Who's
the seller of this?
&gt;&gt; This is being sold by a company called
Government Remarketing. So,
someone took these out, made the
decision that we need to move them.
These are in Union City, California,
like about an hour from me.
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; But I don't think anybody's bid, the
opening bid's $10,000.
There's no reserve price. I have no idea
how to make money with this, but I'll be
darn sure that if I spent some time
really digging into it, there's got to
be some upside here somehow. Somebody is
going to swoop in and steal this stuff.
Now, these guys are like, "I don't know
how to do it. Hasn't I have no idea how
to test it because they took it out."
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; They just, "Okay, we're taking them out.
We're putting them in the warehouse."
And that's it. Okay. They made a mistake

[25:00]
And that's it. Okay. They made a mistake
here. They said it was solar charging,
which it's not.
&gt;&gt; But you can ask these people questions.
It's like, "Hey, it says solar. I don't
see any panels." This guy said, "Okay,
it's not solar. That was a mistake." You
can ask a lot of questions of these
guys. Well, I just Googled it as we've
been talking and it looks like you can
buy these for like $4,500 each. So, this
is a pretty good price. Six
&gt;&gt; That's interesting.
&gt;&gt; Six of them for 10,000.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think you could own it
for$10,000.
&gt;&gt; Wow.
&gt;&gt; The owner can set the power cost. So, I
think basically what it is is like
&gt;&gt; Tesla will pay for all of this to put
like if you own a business off the
interstate and Tesla says, "Yep, thumbs
up. We'll pay for all this, but we're
going to keep all of the power cost. And
maybe you'll get some foot traffic from
it.
&gt;&gt; Sure.
&gt;&gt; Or you pay for all the hardware and you
can mark up the power cost within these
reasonable limits.
&gt;&gt; I Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Pretty wild. So, one of the things
I absolutely love about this reselling
business is the massive breadth of

[26:01]
business is the massive breadth of
different things you can get into,
right? Obviously, this is super
specialized and you know, but there's a
massive moat in front of this thing
because like you said, what would you do
with this thing? And who's got the
infrastructure? But if you owned a piece
of property or a gas station or some
other thing with a parking lot, you
know, would you take a $10,000, you
know, contact start contacting people
because this is I think there's two days
left. It's been up this has been up here
for about a week. Two days left. Gov
deals is just the best playground you
can ever get into. I I tell people, you
know, don't watch Netflix, watch
auctions.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; If you're in interested in this
business, you should look you should be
at Gov deals every single day. I mean,
looking at it and just sit on your couch
or flip through your phone or whatever
it is, you know, use your time wisely
and look at this stuff and think about
the possibilities. Don't sit there and
watch
&gt;&gt; stupid in, you know, reels and this guy.
Well, I want you to watch those, too.
But, you know, this stuff is these

[27:00]
But, you know, this stuff is these
opportunities are out there, man. And
&gt;&gt; yeah,
&gt;&gt; definitely.
&gt;&gt; This is a cool one.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I really enjoy it. What's What?
Here's another one that's really
interesting.
&gt;&gt; Oo,
&gt;&gt; this is a full motion simulator.
&gt;&gt; It's being taken out. It's everything
works. All the support stuff you see
here.
&gt;&gt; Would you make like a ride out of this?
&gt;&gt; That's why I wanted to talk to you about
it. You know, you're the idea guy, so we
got to figure it out. It's everything.
So you have seats and the whole nine
yards that are in it. It looks like a
airplane in there. There's all this gear
that comes with it. It It's a big
project. Massive project. All this
stuff, test equipment, different things.
&gt;&gt; Looks like it's a highly realistic full
motion flight simulator for the
Blackhawk helicopter.
&gt;&gt; Perfect.
&gt;&gt; Used for military and civilian pilot
training. That could be monetized.
&gt;&gt; Hey, you could fly a Blackhawk without
needing a pilot's license. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; 10 bucks.
&gt;&gt; Yes. The cost to build this thing was, I
looked it up and I wrote it down. It was

[28:01]
looked it up and I wrote it down. It was
$18 million
and it's going to sell. We're watching
it in real time. The time remaining in
the auction is 4 minutes 3 minutes and
59 seconds
&gt;&gt; and it's sitting at $322,000.
Okay.
&gt;&gt; Seven biders.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. And
&gt;&gt; how do we see who those biders are? I'm
so curious what their plans are with it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. You got to cozy up. And this is a
GSA auction. So you're buying it the
government services administration.
You're buying it direct from the
government. It's at Fort Campbell,
Kentucky, right? Is that a whatever?
Some kind of military base. There's all
kinds of data that you can download
&gt;&gt; that talk about it. They give you the
the name of the people to call so you
can talk. I This is a massive, you know,
it's a massive project, but a massive
opportunity. I mean, they give you the
guy's phone number right here. You can
call this guy and ask him questions
about it. So, it's an army. This guy's
an army, you know, representative. I
love these deals, man. I can't stop
looking at them because I just my brain
keeps thinking like, well, wow, where do
I put this thing and how much can I

[29:00]
I put this thing and how much can I
charge? Have you ever put your kids in
one of those simulator things at the
amusement park or
&gt;&gt; it's not cheap?
&gt;&gt; Well, I I featured a business a couple
weeks ago that lets you drive tanks,
drive and shoot tanks in Texas.
&gt;&gt; That's awesome.
&gt;&gt; And there's only like three or four
states where it's even legal to drive a
tank. And of course, Texas is one of
them.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; But these guys crush it. It's called
like drive a tank.com. big dude. Yeah,
&gt;&gt; I think you could do a similar play with
with this.
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; right.
&gt;&gt; This is essentially like if you ever
been on that Star Tours at Disney World
or Disneyland, this is what it is. It's
see all the shock stuff below and all
that kind. I mean, it's pretty wild. It
is It's amazing.
&gt;&gt; Oh my gosh.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And just to clarify, govdees.com, that's
a private company. That is not a
government entity. GSA auctions.gov is a
&gt;&gt; It's a government entity. Gov deals is a
platform where government agencies can
sell their stuff, but not typically not
the federal government. It's more like
state and local municipalities and that

[30:00]
state and local municipalities and that
and that kind of thing, but
&gt;&gt; police cruisers.
&gt;&gt; Yes, exactly. Oh, yes. You want to own a
police car, you want to own a fire
truck, you want to own I mean any
&gt;&gt; ambulance
am they give away ambulances, dude.
They're they're ridiculously Oh, yeah.
They're super cheap. Fire trucks, too.
Firet trucks and buses like electric
buses, too. tons of electric full
electric buses. I I featured a whole
series of them back in DC. They
discontinued this program. They put like
hund00 million dollars into it and then
four years later they discontinued the
whole thing and the buses sold for
between 2500 and $25,000. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; What?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's ridiculous. And people were
buying for
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. I mean, you could take
people on tours in those things like
Nashville has all those bus tours, you
know?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, let's go back. And
&gt;&gt; that's really surprising to me that the
government would waste money. I'm not
familiar with
&gt;&gt; I've never heard of.
&gt;&gt; Let's see here. It's Let's see if we if
there's any electric buses listed here

[31:00]
there's any electric buses listed here
today on Gub Deals. Okay. It's selling.
It's at $2,000.
&gt;&gt; This is a new It's called a new flyer.
Look at this one. This is cool.
&gt;&gt; Does it say what the range is? Oh,
that's cool.
&gt;&gt; Do you see that mini bus? I love that.
Let's Okay, let's look at this one
first. Let's check this out. This is So
there's a whole bunch of them. These are
one of them. So this a a diesel electric
hybrid. This bus was sold back in April,
but the winning bidder did not pay. That
happens all the time. 37. Yeah. Right
here. The DC Department of
Transportation circulator bus program is
ending.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Status title is clear. Vehicle
comes with a key. Push button start. The
vehicle starts. The vehicle
&gt;&gt; everything's fine.
&gt;&gt; Everything's fine.
&gt;&gt; And that that's why the story is so
important.
&gt;&gt; Yes. Because we we're very creative
about creating excuses of why we
shouldn't buy something, right? And it's
like, oh, it's probably defective. It's
like, no, no, no. Read the read the dang
&gt;&gt; the details. Oh, there's a million
reasons not to do any of this stuff, but
you're you're you're missing out on the

[32:00]
you're you're you're missing out on the
opportunity. If if you don't want to buy
a bus, go buy a a train set from Target
and make $3,000, you know. But here,
they give you the VIN number, so I'm
sure you could do some research and find
some information about it. This stuff is
all the time, and these things look like
they're in pretty good shape. They give
you all these
&gt;&gt; $2500.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. 2025 at
&gt;&gt; $225.
&gt;&gt; Don't overpric it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's going to close in two days.
&gt;&gt; Kids off school in this thing. It'd be
awesome.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. This thing is going to sell. I'll
bet you it sells for under five grand.
&gt;&gt; Oh my gosh.
&gt;&gt; That's That's my prediction.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Cuz there's just a ton of them.
And you know, people pay for them and
they're like, "Oh, I got to go pick it
up and what do I do?" And you know, here
it goes inside. You can see. Let's see
if there's give you more pictures
inside. There's the driver's seat. Come
on. Let's see the back. Nobody wants to
see that stuff. I want to see the seats.
Okay. So, there it is. It's like cleared
out. This would be perfect for the van
life, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; It's wild. But this stuff is all over.
These are in Maryland. This was a DC
program. District of Columbia

[33:01]
program. District of Columbia
government. You know, there's somebody
you could pro you can ask questions.
Look, you call Donald Jackson. They give
you his phone number so you can talk to
it and you can go inspect it. You don't
have to just look at it online. You can
go start it up.
&gt;&gt; It's crazy. So,
&gt;&gt; I mean, you could start a business just
like finding buyers for these like go to
like private limo and bus companies that
take that already own a bus company.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; And say, "Hey, I have access, you know,
I've don't need to know where it where
it is or where you're seeing it. I have
access, you know, I've got this bus. I'm
selling it for nine grand." They're
probably used to paying 90 grand or 300
grand for these buses.
&gt;&gt; I imagine it's Yeah, I imagine you're
right. Yep. that when I posted it, the
most of the comments were because
they've sold new ones too, like 2019,
2022. Most of the comments were around
off-grid people that wanted to strip the
batteries out, use those in their Tesla
systems or whatever, and then scrap the
bus.
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Power wall system.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Build the power cuz the batteries
are so expensive. So,

[34:01]
are so expensive. So,
&gt;&gt; yeah. And that pro that thing probably
has some massive batteries.
&gt;&gt; I could imagine, man. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I mean, how much bigger than a Tesla
battery do you think it is? And those
things cost 15 grand.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. That's right. So,
yeah, it it's pretty wild. And I just
This stuff keeps me up at night. I can't
stop thinking about the opportunities
here. It's Yeah, it's crazy. It's crazy.
&gt;&gt; Quick question. What if there were a
private community out there of people
that were building businesses based on
this podcast? Well, I just made it and
it's only for business starters and
business builders. It's called TK owners
and it's basically like having me and a
hundred other business geniuses as your
business partner. Also, there's going to
be exclusive new trends, growth hacks,
business ideas, and a database of
everything I've ever talked about.
You'll find thousands of startup case
studies. You'll have weekly ask me
anything with me while I'll answer your
questions directly. You can join now at
tkowners.com. Link in the show notes.
Let's see what that flight simulator
sold for.
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Let's Where's it at? Oh, a
minute. Oh, it's getting bumped. So,

[35:00]
minute. Oh, it's getting bumped. So,
there So, they do popcorn bidding. So,
if you bid in the last probably 30,
there's no sniping. It's not like eBay.
If you bid in the last 30 seconds,
they're gonna add another six minutes on
here.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, it's sitting at 322,300.
I wanted to look at this little mini bus
right here. It's near my town. This city
car mini bus electric vehicle. 3500
bucks.
&gt;&gt; That looks cool.
&gt;&gt; That does look cool. Who could you
drive? Let's see. Who could you drive
around in that thing? That's awesome.
Yeah, that's killer. That's nice. It'd
be nice if you had a piece of property
and looks like some somebody's been
doing some wrenching on it.
where the work where the pictures have a
socket set and a bunch of screws in it
that may you may have to do some work
and they'll tell you though right here
right was warning when removed not
guaranteed. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Who knows when it was removed. So seats
10 available to help.
&gt;&gt; Oh it only needs new batteries. That's
it.
&gt;&gt; That could be the most that's it. That's
the whole thing, right? Yeah. Yeah.
Anyhow, I love this stuff. The other
thing I wanted to show you that just
came back up today were the KCT10s. So,

[36:01]
came back up today were the KCT10s. So,
these are the this is the
&gt;&gt; military version of the D of the DCT10,
right? And I think they've sold about 20
of these. These are these are in
Arizona, which is a great place to
store. There's four of them being
auctioned off. This was a $52 million
plane when it is first sold. And the
opening the current bid, the reserve to
to bid is $500,000. Okay. Massive
discount. They often sell units that are
where they don't don't fly where they've
like stripped everything. But these are
still flying.
&gt;&gt; You can do with these
&gt;&gt; I don't Well, I like
&gt;&gt; Well, I I have some ideas, but
&gt;&gt; what would you do with it as like a an
actual airplane? You know what I'm
saying?
&gt;&gt; I guess it would be a cargo plane when
you're trying to do like tariff runs or
whatever get I would imagine, you know,
cargo is is the the big game here. Yeah,
for this type of thing, it would be

[37:00]
for this type of thing, it would be
interesting to They always sell
&gt;&gt; every time somebody buys this.
&gt;&gt; And this is 20 days, so you have plenty
of time to go up there. It's at GSA
auctions.gov.
You can go look at it. You can go
inspect it. You can contact Javier
Olivea at the uh Air Force and you can
go take a look at this thing. So, oh,
this one is Okay, so this aircraft Okay,
I'm I'm I'm speaking out of turn because
I didn't read this yet. This aircraft's
non-flyable condition, not in compliance
with FAA.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay.
&gt;&gt; So, you have to bring
&gt;&gt; I was going to make it an Airbnb anyway.
&gt;&gt; Well, that's what I thought. Yeah. I
want to buy the Really the ones I get
more excited about are the ones that the
wings are already off so I can transport
it and you could put it in there and
make it an Airbnb.
&gt;&gt; I think it would be phenomenal.
&gt;&gt; And
&gt;&gt; this site always has salvaged aircraft.
I thought like I love helicopters and
you can buy helicopters without the
engines and the rotors and stuff for
between a th000 and $5,000 up here all
the time. So like if I had a kid focused

[38:01]
the time. So like if I had a kid focused
or tank business or that dig whatever
they do where they drive construction
equipment, man, I would have four or
five helicopters these kids could just
climb all over and go crazy. Let's see
if they have any helicopters here. This
is a regular helicopter. This is There's
the simulator. Let's see. That's
probably there. Golf, electric cars,
baby food. Do you want to buy baby food
from the government? That's a little
scary,
&gt;&gt; baby.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Let's go back and see what's the
baby food selling for. I'm curious. It
looks like brand new. It's in Puerto
Rico. Pedialyte mixed fruit. Let's just
see. I'm just curious. So, this is 486
cans. Oh, powder simulacc hypoallergenic
instant formula. Oh, November 2025.
expiration date, right? So you you're
okay. You got to move it somewhere where
they don't really care.
&gt;&gt; So it's Pedialyte formula.
&gt;&gt; Yep. This one's not PD. This is some
kind of Simulac. Simileac is the name.

[39:01]
kind of Simulac. Simileac is the name.
&gt;&gt; How do you spell that?
&gt;&gt; S I M I L A C. Simileac powder instant
formula.
&gt;&gt; What is the uh like the price per unit?
&gt;&gt; Well, there's no bids. 500 bucks you
could buy the whole thing for.
&gt;&gt; So you could pay basically a dollar per
unit.
&gt;&gt; Maybe that's what Maybe that's too much.
Oh, don't. Yeah, dollar per unit. Let's
just say
&gt;&gt; well it selling for $9 to $20 per unit
on Facebook Marketplace right now. I'm
looking at it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I wonder how you'd have to
research and see how important that
expiration date is and may you know
because some some people probably freak
out about it, but a lot of people
realize that well that's just a guide
and they're not, you know, they're not
&gt;&gt; Well, you know how you do that, right?
You just list it. You put the expiration
date in Facebook Marketplace.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; And see what people say.
&gt;&gt; And see what happens. They're going to
say, "Oh, that's a smoking deal, and we
know it's it lasts a year or more."
&gt;&gt; You can also buy real estate from the
GSA. And one of the things that caught
my eye that's selling today, the auction
ends today in 17 hours.
&gt;&gt; That's cool.

[40:00]
&gt;&gt; That's cool.
&gt;&gt; Is this lighthouse
&gt;&gt; and it's in
&gt;&gt; Oh, that is cool.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And I thought, what a great
Airbnb, right?
&gt;&gt; It's on its own private island. It has a
dock.
&gt;&gt; Where is this at?
&gt;&gt; Connecticut. Fairfield, Connecticut.
Penfield Reef Lighthouse. It was It was
built in 1874
style. Yeah, I don't know if it was
built in 1874. It's one mile off
Bridgeport's Black Rock Harbor. You got
to have a boat. 51 ft light tower, 1568
square feet. That's enough for a couple
of bedrooms. It's got a pier, a boat
landing. It's pretty wild, but
&gt;&gt; And it's 370,000.
&gt;&gt; Yes, that's a current bid right now. It
ends in 17 hours. There's 27 bids. This
bid's been This has been going on for
since June. They they leave this up here
for long. I You can imagine the
government doesn't move too fast.
&gt;&gt; The bid started at 100 grand and today
it's up at 370.
&gt;&gt; Well, dude, look at uh these are some

[41:00]
&gt;&gt; Well, dude, look at uh these are some
Airbnb lighouses. Oh, nice rent.
&gt;&gt; 300 to 600 a night. And this is in the
same This is near Connecticut here.
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. So, your payment on a $370,000
house is going to be what? 2,000 a month
if you financed it.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; You'd pay for that in four bookings,
five bookings.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's pretty wild.
&gt;&gt; And you get to own this cool place, man.
And you get to go stay there
&gt;&gt; when you know when you're doing work on
it. I love that. That's my slippery math
formula. Whenever I get to use it and
enjoy it, I'm happy paying a little bit
more
&gt;&gt; because, you know, I own a place on the
river cuz I love to fish. Well, the
numbers don't always have to work out,
right? So yeah,
&gt;&gt; you know, I love the the real estate
stuff and you know that's again you can
do it just gsactions.gov.
This is real estate sales.gov. You can
buy this Rice County Jail annex for a
million dollars. Here's another
lighthouse that's coming soon. This is
in Rhode Island.
&gt;&gt; That looks gorgeous.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you could buy the former Tatanel

[42:00]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you could buy the former Tatanel
Air Force Space Surveillance Station.
&gt;&gt; Current wanted to own one of those.
current $65,000,
dude. This is, you know, this is a heck
of a story right here.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; 101. It's 100 acres.
&gt;&gt; 100 acres. That's like another
asymmetric bet here is people could be
looking at this like, oh, I don't need a
space station, but they're not noticing
that it's 100 acres, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Obviously, somebody's
people been hanging out in here. Anyway,
fun place to poke around. The story here
is today, like I said, we started the
theme is backward and boring. Buy
backwards. You know, know what you can
sell it for before you start. Don't buy
anything that you don't know already
know what you can sell it for. Have that
