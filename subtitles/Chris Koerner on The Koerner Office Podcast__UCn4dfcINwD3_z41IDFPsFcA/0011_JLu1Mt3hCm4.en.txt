[00:00]
this is Ker's Corner episode three of 10
we're going to keep this going uh in
seven weeks if it's any good if it's not
we're going to abandon it because I've
got you know 852 projects going on right
now and I don't need another one unless
it's showing some signs of life so the
purpose of Ker's corner is to ask any
questions such as help me with my
Business Partnership dispute help me
decide whether or not I should start
this business should I start this job
should I go all in on crypto should I
marry my high school sweetheart should I
get half Barbacoa half chicken or full
barbac COA these are all good questions
but really like evaluate my business
idea roast my business idea here's my
business tell me how to grow it tell me
how to acquire customers what what is my
customer segment what is a revenue line
that I might be or a revenue stream that
I might be missing so the way it kind of
goes is you'll start by kind of posing a
question or a problem and then I'm going
to ask you like five to 20 questions to
really get to the heart of it it and

[01:00]
really get to the heart of it it and
then I'll kind of give you a
prescription and then that's it so also
if you just have a really cool business
that you want to brag about please do
I'd love to hear about it and I'd love
to tweet about it but most people are
hesitant to do that because they want
people to copy them and I get it so
Heath do we have any people requesting
to speak yet no requests yet but if
you're H interested in doing any of the
things Chris just said hit the request
button and I'll add you the speaker and
we'll get this show on the road all
right so a few people sent in some
questions beforehand so I can get to
those while we wait but live is always
better what were you saying Oh I said
let's do it let's do the one from
tamone that was was that the HVAC one
yeah all right so he says I have a
working demo for a tool that gives
historical data on a building's HVAC
systems outputs to a custom website no
one gives good data on the what the heck
happened this morning before my shift
how do I reach the managers of these
buildings when they aren't on LinkedIn
anywhere so this guy is looking for the

[02:03]
anywhere so this guy is looking for the
commercial property managers
specifically so he could sell them
software that spits out data on HVAC
system systems so first of all they are
on LinkedIn you just don't really know
what their title is yet so if you don't
have any customers then I would drill
down on what their title is first if you
do have customers then just look up what
their titles are or look at what
companies they work for and then use
Apollo to search for them in LinkedIn um
by title and just start doing cold
Outreach otherwise whenever I have
trouble finding a customer segment to
market to I just go to upwork and ask
for help from vas that can do the job
for me because they're going to be full
of ideas this is all they do for a
living so win in out ask VA on upwork
but I I do agree that this seems kind of
like a hard customer segment to sell to
but that usually means that it's offset
by great recurring revenue or software
that's really integrated into their
systems therefore low churn or just High

[03:02]
systems therefore low churn or just High
ticket so persist don't give up because
it sounds like it'll be a good business
if you could find some
customers all right we got 40 people in
here but no one wants to talk no
requests all right I'm gonna go to the
second question it usually takes a good
15 20 minutes to warm up the room um
so second question this guy so I've
tweeted about the great solar eclipse
Happ happening in April and so this guy
says I'm guessing you get a million
messages asking for advice but I'm going
to anyway I had the idea for eclipse
glasses back in 2017 after I paid $40
for a pair in April of 2023 I started
the process of building a website
finding a certified manufacturer Etc my
plan has been to Target event spaces in
schools sell in bulk and then travel to
Austin and sell in person the weekend
before I've sent several thousand emails
to event spaces and schools in my
largest cities I'm originally from Maine
family is still there so I've sent them
a couple thousand

[04:00]
a couple thousand
yada yada yada my email marketing has
not worked well my end goal is to roll
the profits into a couple other product
ideas I have and hopefully escape the 95
do you have any thoughts on other
approaches or potentially connections
that would have any interest in glasses
yes I do so you might not like this
advice but you're you're putting all
this work into developing these glasses
for an event that's going to last
literally two and a half minutes now
that might sound hypocritical because I
wrote 2500 words um newsletter on making
a profit on this event but it was based
around making a profit at scale with
like a race that could really make you
six seven figures and that you could
roll into other eclipses in the future
you don't need glasses for every Eclipse
so I feel like if you already have these
skills and the hustle and the the
wherewithal to build a business that
will only last for a day then transfer
those skills over to something else
that's more sustainable also Al like

[05:00]
that's more sustainable also Al like
there's so many people in on Alibaba
selling these glasses I would just not
worry about a manufacturer just buy some
and flip some so that would be my
suggestion awesome well we have we have
a couple people yeah Corey was first so
Corey why don't you come off mute and
ask a question hey guys if you remember
me I talked last week about a lead genen
agency so I have a question about
pricing for that is this that cold email
yes sir that's correct okay yeah hit me
with it so I was talking with a business
owner I mentioned last time that my my
parents are owners of Self Storage
properties and that puts me in an
interesting position I I manage one of
their facilities and all day long I get
to talk with different business owners
for all these different different
Enterprises a lot of them are
landscapers but we also have somebody
who does Amazon FBA and I was talking
with him about it in passing yesterday
uh and he mentioned to me that I

[06:00]
uh and he mentioned to me that I
probably need to charge a little bit
more for my service than I was
anticipating he likened my cold email
service to like a wholesaler for example
in real estate and all they do is make a
connection uh between a buyer and a
seller and they get a commission and he
said 10% commission is is fairly
standard but what I was looking at was
much less than that I was looking at
about a two% commission based on what my
my target audience was so in terms of
pricing
if the deal that I would bring to a
recruiter or a staffing agency is worth
anywhere you know 20 to 50 Grand what do
you think a a realistic offer could be
for for pricing for me I was originally
thinking a $500 onboarding fee with
maybe like a a a small like $250 to $350
fee per booked meeting but maybe it'd be
better to go for something like a
commission on their commission which is
what he suggested maybe like a flat five

[07:01]
what he suggested maybe like a flat five
to 10% of of that commission so I just
wanted to get your Insight on that yeah
great question so I I like doing this
six 12 18 months down the road this type
of a model but not from the outset and
here's why you don't know yet what your
conversion rate is going to be you don't
know the quality of the lead that you're
going to be passing on to the recruiters
you don't know like what the funnel
looks like is it going to take 10 calls
to get one sale or two calls to get one
sale
and so there's always going to be a
trade-off between the size of your
ticket and how much handholding or
tracking or preventing of recruiter
bypassing you that goes on and so if I
were you I would start with no
onboarding fee no flat monthly fee but a
pay per like call booked lead uh fee
call it 501 $200 whatever you think um
is fair and then just maniacally follow
up with your recuiter how's it going
how's that guy work out out how'd that
guy work out how'd that guy work out now

[08:01]
guy work out how'd that guy work out now
only going to want to hop on calls with
people that look good on paper in their
resume so these should be good solid
leads and then after a few months once
you learn all right all right it's
taking five calls on average for a
recruiter to close a lead then you can
blast that on the front page of your
website and say you know we have a 20x
Roi like that's huge then you can start
kind of testing pull a client to the
side and say Hey I want to test this
percentage mod
I think it'll save you money right now
you're spending $1,000 for every person
you bring on what if I took 2% of the
the close and then it'll be $500 and so
you're probably wondering why would I do
that but I I just want data right I just
want to learn you're going to net out
ahead I'm gonna get some data a great
case study and then I can put that on my
website so you just you just got to
start testing and you got to be patient
with the pricing it's it's really like
the guy who's who's telling you that you
could take 10% yeah you probably could

[09:01]
could take 10% yeah you probably could
but not yet nobody knows who you are and
you don't know how good or bad these
leads are so I I would just start super
cheap get your foot in the door get some
traction get some data get a case study
and then charge bore later on that's
very good Insight Chris I appreciate it
also just want to say one last thing I
uh I love your ability to very quickly
analyze and give like what seems to me
to be you know million dooll advice in
one minute uh it's just phenomenal to me
thank you thank you I appreciate that
Corey good luck all right thanks Corey
I'm not sure how to say the next person
um in line but your user handle is AA
Orit 1124 you're the next so go for it
hey yeah yes Mr Ortiz so I'm I'm driving
right now so let me know if I cut off or
anything but uh nobody wanted to talk so
I figured I jump in here it's kind of a
funny business idea that it's just a
spitballing business business this idea
that I would like to tell you just to

[10:01]
that I would like to tell you just to
see get your thoughts on it uh so before
I do that quick question for you and
What scenario would you tow your vehicle
would I tow it or have it towed well if
I had a flat tire or it broke down so
pretty much if you think of Towing you
think of something negative correct
something negative happen so yep it's
fair to say that toen has a bad PR
problem okay so this is what I'm
thinking what if you in cultas Rebrand
Towing so let's say for example a use
case somebody after to work they go
drive to the bars with their buddies and
they have a little bit too much to drink
and they know they shouldn't drive home
but they don't want to Uber home because
then they got to come wake up in the
morning the next day and come pick up
the car so what if we offer them a home
delivery service or not a toy home
delivery service and then when in the

[11:01]
delivery service and then when in the
morning after they get home the car's
already in the driveway so the
responsible thing to do is not GNA cause
any convenience and then do yeah would
the tow truck driver give them a ride
home or they would Uber home I'm sure
for now they would have to Uber home
like they were going to do anyways or
like they would have to drive drive home
when they know they shouldn't have uh
but in this case they they Uber home and
then they just with a few fle on their
phone they schedule a pickup and when
they wake up in the morning their car is
going to be home so obviously not
everybody can afford this this is for a
specific a guy that's already dropping
$400 at the bar he wouldn't mind
spending another 200 or something
whatever the to is and how that would
work is we wouldn't own any of the
towing Vehicles there's 30 30 mom and
pop shops already Towing Vehicles they
would put we would have the flow of
orders and then we just subcontract a
towing company
and there's no R the to the car just has

[12:02]
and there's no R the to the car just has
to be there by the time they wake up at
7 a.m. or
whatever okay so I was as you started I
was prepared to hate the idea because I
I don't like the idea of rebranding a
whole industry but I don't I don't I
don't think you have to do that I like
the idea also the domain named drunk
toes.com is available if someone wants
to sign that I I like the idea because
tow trucks sit idle you know what 90 95%
of the time so what are they doing
between 10 p.m. and 3:00 am every day
they're probably contracted out with you
know bar owners and restaurants that are
parking illegally but aside from that
they're probably just sitting so I like
the idea of calling a tow truck owner a
smaller company giving him this idea and
saying hey do you mind if I just test
this with you like as my fulfillment
partner I'll do all the marketing and
everything and I don't even want to make
money on this yet I just want to see
does this work can we generate some good
local PR do bar owners care about this
like I just want to test it but I want

[13:00]
like I just want to test it but I want
to know like if I call you you're going
to know what I'm talking about and
you're going to happy you're going to be
happy to go do this and then get like a
list of his prices and then I would try
that like drunk toes.com
and I don't think you have to go into
like Towing is negative but it doesn't
have to be like just forget all that
just reposition the whole Service as
Towing for drunks right and I think it's
even more attractive if the tow truck
driver will give them a right home
because then they'll save money on an
Uber they don't have to go get their car
the next day but I like that idea and
you could you could take what I did in
college I had an iPhone repair store and
we marketed by getting tyvec wristbands
with our ad printed on them and then we
gave them out to bars for free and then
bars would just distribute them to
people as they walked in and then people
get drunk they would break their phone
they would have a coupon on their
wristband for phone restore they would
bring it in and it was amazing marketing
so you could do the same thing you could
go to a bar owner say Hey you know how
you're buying wristbands don't buy them

[14:01]
you're buying wristbands don't buy them
anymore I'll give them to you for free
and then you put their ad on there and
you can see what you can make yeah
another cool way I was thinking of
advertising this would be go to the bars
at like 5: am and the cars that are
still parked they're probably gonna get
picked up in the morning by the owner
you can leave a something on there
saying your car could have been home
already I like that yeah yeah my only my
only question to this is how much money
could you make right what could you
charge or what could your margin be
especially if you were just middleman
yeah that's my big that's my big I
thinking like uber there's gross booking
and then our fee on top
so the person pays whatever the towing
is and we just charge a little fee on
top since we're not we don't have any
equipment no employees no nothing it's
just we're just the lead generator for
the towing companies and we're the the
service for the homeowners or the not
the yeah I feel like it needs to be just
a flat price to the consumer and then
you work out a percentage fee on the
back end with the the toe the tow truck

[15:01]
back end with the the toe the tow truck
owner just keep it simple to the
consumer but yeah that's a good idea I
like kind of a meme idea I just want to
just just nobody wants to
speak no it's sometimes the meme ideas
are the best IDE so all thank yep thanks
man all right the next speaker we got is
Kevin C you're up Kevin hey Chris first
of all thanks for for doing this U I
joined a little late so I I caught the
very tail end of your solar eclipse talk
so you may already kind of spoke to this
but I started back in 2017 I'm in
Virginia I ended up paying like 40 bucks
for two pairs and so yeah I this is the
question I just answered actually okay
so I've already started it started about
a year ago I've got a website glasses
bunch of stuff my I guess my biggest
question I've sent about 2 200 cold
emails out to event places in schools I
thought those would be like good places
to kind of get some bulk orders since I
bought 40,000 of these and I haven't had

[16:00]
bought 40,000 of these and I haven't had
a sort of walk with like the marketing
I'm flying out to Austin because I have
a friend there and there's a million
people there just to try and sell them
yeah I was wondering if you had any
thoughts on like I haven't done cold
calling yet it's kind of my next upep
but I can I can link my website if you
have suggestions for that too I I think
I know what to tell you so I if you
already have 40,000 glasses like okay
you got to get rid of them I would join
local Facebook groups all along the
eclipse path that are like targeted I
mean ideally they're targeted at
business owners but you might not find a
lot of those so at least just Target it
at the locals like Buy sale you know
garage sale Facebook groups All Along
The Path and say hey like anyone want to
make some money and just do go the
Wholesale route like let's say you pay
50 cents for these I would just try to
unload them honestly like free shipping
you know different price breaks for 500
or a th000 and like you you could sell

[17:00]
or a th000 and like you you could sell
these you know buy them for a dollar and
sell them for 20 or buy them for $5 and
sell them for 20 and just try to unload
them and based on the demand you see or
not start adjusting your price from
there because obviously if these don't
sell in the next couple weeks they're
never going to sell yeah and then and
then take some with you to Austin and
try to sell some yourself for full
margin yeah those my I'm going up like
four days before so I thought I'd hit up
you know a couple universities a church
a couple churches and then just kind I
set up in parks and stuff yeah I just I
don't know how much luck you're going to
have going through these schools
churches businesses and buildings
because they're they're not going to put
much mind space into an event that only
lasts a couple minutes right it's just
not on their radar but if you appeal to
everyone's get-rich Quicks Gene because
we all have one then just appeal to them
the individual that has a thousand bucks
that wants to turn it into 5,000 bucks
in two hours right that's what I would
focus on they're a lot easier to reach
you could copy and paste the same Post

[18:00]
you could copy and paste the same Post
in hundred of f different Facebook
groups and I I bet you'll unload them
that way all right awesome thanks so
much Chris appreciate the advice yep no
problem yep all right thanks Let's see
we have Alex next you're up all right
thanks for taking the call so I want you
to roast my idea about this uh lead
genen uh business that I just thought of
last night just because I recently had a
a roof refa done to my house so I would
you know via I don't know door hangers
you know sign whatnot Facebook to try to
sell
drone to homeowners basically as a you
know roof inspection and you know if
there's any issues with that then I
would try to kind of package that and
try to sell to other roofers in the area
so what is the pitch to the homeowner
does the homeowner have to pay for this
uh just to cover the cost I think so
they you know I'll probably do like you
know twice know inspection twice a year
like $99 or something like that you know
no issues it's all good if they have

[19:00]
no issues it's all good if they have
issues then if they agree to you know
get quot from roofers then I can maybe
you know sell the you know these are
pretty good leads to roofers so and then
I but I have no idea what you know it
would cost or how to package that so I
just want to hear your thoughts on that
would you be taking these pictures like
with or without their consent first with
because they're the homeowners will pay
for it yeah okay what about the idea of
just proactively taking pictures of
everyone on the Block okay and then
offering to sell them to them what do
you think about that my uncle does that
actually he he does it like on a
commercial scale like a new high school
was built in the area and he took a
bunch of drone pictures and he's like
hey do you want to buy these and he has
like a 60% conversion rate or something
and so I don't think anyone would really
get pissed if you took a picture of
their house from a drone and and like
it's going to happen a small percentage
of the time I don't think it should be
enough for you to worry
but I would I would try the positioning

[20:01]
but I would I would try the positioning
of it and think like all right like some
people just want a picture of their
house right especially if it's a really
nice house or especially if they
recently bought it and then some people
might just want to know you know how
does their roof look I I just don't know
what I don't like about this idea is
that it's it's new and novel and so you
don't know you know you could just be
spin spinning your wheels trying to test
something that's not already proven but
if I were you I would start with like a
cue saac with like 20 homes and you're
like okay this is my test subject and if
it doesn't go well then I'm not going to
do this further and take pictures of
every house and then honestly I would
just knock their doors in the evening
and say hey I'm taking pictures of these
homes and then insert Pitch A B C or D
you could go for the angle of just do
you want a nice Fram like a professional
picture of your home or it's like hey
would you like your home inspected once
a year twice a year for $100 and then

[21:00]
a year twice a year for $100 and then
like or would you like your home
inspected for free how about that and
then you just sell the leads like you
with any Marketplace you can Marketplace
or you can you can monetize the buyer or
the seller or both and so I would start
with one and then six months down the
road be like okay can I monetize the
other side of this like 80% of
homeowners would love to see a free
picture of their house what percentage
of them would be willing to pay for it I
see but if you start Charing ing both
sides of the marketplace in the
beginning then you're not going to know
is this a bad idea or am I just charging
too am I trying to charge too much yeah
that makes sense but I'm curious to see
how it goes so if you try it let us come
back and let us know how it goes thank
you no problem man cool thanks Alex
Chris we have one in the comments
actually this time they are unable to
talk right now so I thought I would why
don't why don't we save the comments for
like near the end or if there's any uh
empty space just as we have four people
sure no worries all right Odetta you're

[22:00]
sure no worries all right Odetta you're
up sweet thanks for having me I have h
two questions so the first is I'm a I'm
a data engineer for an iot startup in
the waste huler space and we have some
customers via like data subscription for
what we provide to their customers for
like Erp initiatives when they have
corporate customers but I recently went
to a conference and you know I had kind
of a hard time you know identifying kind
of who to approach or how to kind of
break the ice there because the profile
of a waste hauler and kind of the area
of prowess that I'm coming from for the
product are a little bit different so I
was just curious uh for this first
question if you have any advice on how
to kind of show up and communicate or
you know when it is that I'm looking for
more haulers to add to the book of
business there like what what are some
approaches I can take so it's an iot
software that you sell to waste Haulers
is that correct yeah so it uh it's to
fold so there is a data portal that they

[23:02]
fold so there is a data portal that they
offer to their customers when they're
corporate customers who have ESG
initiatives where it is that they need
to track how much waste is diverted from
landfills and one of the ways we enable
that is through the second piece which
is an iot device that sits on top of
waist bins well not on top of them but
below them actually measures the amount
of waste in the garbage can versus
measuring it on the truck beds
interesting so that device sits on like
the homeowners like underneath the
homeowner's garbage cans yeah yeah so
whether you're an educ um educational
institution who has to measure how much
you're composting from the cafeteras or
if you're just an regular everyday
homeowner uh we have these devices that
sit underneath the bins which will
measure how much is in them every 10
minutes so that you can figure out how
much you need to pick up for what your
like route planning to figure out how
much page is actually on your route
planned or for more accurate invoicing
okay so let's say for instance an

[24:00]
okay so let's say for instance an
elementary school hosts a big Conference
of teachers in the whole County and they
cater all this food and they they throw
half of it away and your device will
tell the waste hauler hey alert alert
like there's a lot more waste in here
than there normally is so plan your
route accordingly yeah yeah or you know
they're on so one two three main street
you and your neighbor have the same bin
the hauler typically will take the the
total tonnage of the street that they
pick up for their route and then average
it out for what they charge you but if
you have a bin full of paper and your
neighbor has a bin full of soup then
you're not going to be very happy with
being charged with the
soup okay yeah so you're you're selling
this to waste haulers that serve
consumers and homeowners and also like
in a B2B setting as well y that's
correct okay and did you say this is a
startup yeah this is a it has funding
it's a startup I'm a data engineer for
the company but because of where I'm
located I went to a conference and
they're like hey you know if there's
haulers in the area like let's try to

[25:00]
haulers in the area like let's try to
build up that book of business I'm like
all right I'll do my best but you know
sales isn't my natural language so okay
all right so so your question is you
know you were kind of thrown for a loop
you went to this conference and they're
like hey let's let's go sell and you're
like I'm I'm a data engineer so you're
kind of you're calling in to ask how you
should approach selling is that correct
yeah or not even uh selling but like how
do I you know start a conversation with
some of these folks who are
who who we're supposed to be servicing
but aren't you know isn't really who I
hang out with on a daily
basis yeah yeah so what are these folks
doing today to solve this problem
nothing or they have or you have a
competitor that they're using so either
they're losing customers so they're not
solving for it because there are now
actual government policies for requiring
waste haulers to report like landfill
diversion and corporate customers who
need that for like carbon accounting and
or the other way that they're doing it
is by they actually have like so for

[26:00]
is by they actually have like so for
example composters are some of our
customers and they'll have like an
actual like luggage scale like a handle
and individually wave in with L scale
okay so are you specifically trying to
sell them in person or just in general I
mean ju really it was in person I think
that was the Canon event here for how I
was you know trying to learn to speak
with these folks it is more in general I
think that this is a skill set I'd like
to develop on but I know it's not really
even just like selling upfront but kind
of getting to know and start a
conversation with these
people okay all right so if I were you
and what city is this conference in yeah
so it was actually in the Wisconsin
Dells I I'm from Wisconsin and you know
it's the Midwest area I previously was
working in New York but I kind of came
back home here so just a lot of
Midwestern you know huler folks whose
families have kind of owned these
companies for
Generations okay and do you guys have
any customers yet yeah we have some out
in New York and Boston both of the city
cities out there and then also some of
the largest haulers out there and what

[27:02]
the largest haulers out there and what
is a typical customer are they usually
more sophisticated or they usually very
old school They it really has been
through strategic investors that we've
gotten our first few customers it
primarily has been educational
institutions and haulers who do have
corporate clients who they're trying to
keep their contracts with but are at
risk of losing them because they don't
have the ability to report uh accurate
tonnage information to them on a regular
basis they uh typically you know if they
are sophisticated quote unquote they
have like a intern who's an Excel monkey
trying to put this together yeah okay so
even though you acquired your first
customers through referrals and
investor Partnerships or friendships or
whatever it is I would think that those
customers like still would not use you
if it just wasn't on their radar or
wasn't in their wheelhouse and so I
would take a a a profile of the
customers that you you have already
Acquired and just try to copy and paste
that and like I would go to outs scraper

[28:03]
that and like I would go to outs scraper
or Google Maps and find all of the
potential customers within a one-hour
Drive of the conference and go look at
their websites and see are they mostly
targeting consumers it's going to be
pretty obvious or B2B and make a list of
the top 10 B2B and just start knocking
doors like it it's always kind of I
think entrepreneurs a lot of times
they're like all right we're selling
this new software it's going to really
improve their business so we need to go
find a customer that is most likely to
not be using something like this but
that customer is most likely to never
use something like this right or to not
adapt to it until it's too late so I
would look for the more sophisticated
customers that actually like have their
ear to the market and know that these es
ESG initiatives are not going away in
fact they're going to get more and more
onerous and then just I would take five
and like try to reach it out to them
beforehand and set something up and take
another five and just show up and then

[29:01]
another five and just show up and then
ask them how are they're solving it like
I would lead with some fear tactics like
hey did you know about X Y and Z you
know ESG initiative coming down the
pipeline like we're just kind of doing a
survey on what you're doing to prevent
against that and either a they have an
answer or B they don't know what you're
talking about and now they're like oh
what you know and then just like start
learning from them and don't even try to
sell but just learn what their pain
points are and and learn like what type
of pitch is most effective with them
what do you think about that yeah yeah
it sounds like typically for like some
of the feedback around being able to
block and tackle around this conference
event it would have been kind of setting
up some warm leads beforehand so I could
go in you know kind of looking for a
familiar face I think it was really
being there and you know I got friendly
with some of the you know like
Regulators who were in the area and the
municipalities just because they are a
little bit more accessible whether we

[30:01]
little bit more accessible whether we
were sitting down for lunch or something
but yeah it rather than kind of looking
into see people of faces I don't know
and be like all right which one's a
huler how do I you know who do I Target
here do I just walk up hi I'm you know
I'm so and so nice to meet you are you
able to like buy an attendee list
beforehand I don't know I'll have to ask
it was a rather smaller event so
probably in reaching out to the
coordinators I might be able to yeah I
would check for that a lot of times
they'll sell it to you beforehand or if
you buy like the most premium package
you'll get it included okay sweet yeah
no that's awesome yeah thank you no I
think the idea of just kind of setting
up something warmer beforehand would
have been helpful and then also just
showing a Natural Curiosity and you know
what they're seeing face to face sounds
like a really nice accessible
approach yeah ju I mean just make sure
to convey that you're genuinely
interested in their industry because
they never ever see that and they'll be
you know flattery is profitable they'll
be flattered they'll be grateful and
they'll just want to you know Spill the

[31:00]
they'll just want to you know Spill the
Beans to you yeah yeah absolutely I'll
come up with some some icebreaking
compliments for some middle-aged men
it'll be fun yeah sounds like but my
second question to piggyback off of that
would be I think in some of the things
that I'm doing I know that to get to the
scale I want to be at I'll have to hire
people and I you know I've been I've
been hired I've otherwise only heard
really like horror stories of having bad
employees just from you know what
actually gets you know liked on the
internet so I I I was hoping that you
could maybe just kind of reset kind of
like expectations or impressions of what
it's like to actually have uh any sort
of employee or hired contractor in
managing them is it is it truly hell on
the other side of doing it or is it you
know is there some sort of piece you're
able to find because you are
hiring yeah no it's I think you're gonna
have a harder time if you try to hire
quote industry experts or people from
competing companies or people in the
trash business I would I would hire
fresh like young people out of college
that are humble and moldable and

[32:01]
that are humble and moldable and
teachable I think you'll have a much
better time like you'll bang your head
against the wall less but you'll but
you'll train them you'll have to train
them more but I think you'll it'll be a
net positive in the end okay gotcha and
is that just from uh you know just a
reduced workload or having you know more
more brains in the same room for the
same thing or what what is the true you
know benefit other than just like a
delegated work that comes from having a
hired team the true benefit of hiring
people yeah yeah I would love to hear if
there's anything above and beyond like
work delegation that you've really found
in in your experience no I mean you're a
startup and you're funded like you're
going to have to do that to grow and so
what will these people be doing will
they be selling or more data scientist
stuff yeah so it it probably would be
more in line with some probably like
technical customer service or like
onboarding and early implementation work
uh I would say that this is also only

[33:00]
uh I would say that this is also only
one of the contracts that I hold so I'm
also thinking about this from a data
digital transformation data engineering
agency kind of Route because I have uh a
few different companies that I'm working
with alongside this one okay yeah I if
if it's a rout a role like that I would
just hire someone fresh out of college
and don't I don't be afraid of hiring
like you're you're funded your investors
are going to want to see growth and it
it it's just necessary and it honestly I
have a lot more positive experience for
managing and leading people and hiring
them than I do negative so I would just
go into it with a positive you know
confirmation bias and and look for the
good and I think you'll do great okay
yeah thank you it's well you know it
might be a little abstract I do
appreciate having another data point
saying like you know it's a good thing
like do this so thank you absolutely
thanks for your questions yeah of course
all right thanks Etta the next one we
have is Andrew Hill I know you mentioned
you might be having some connectivity
issues let's give it just try I I think

[34:01]
issues let's give it just try I I think
it's better now can you guys hear me
okay perfect okay good deal good deal I
I apologize for G to jump off and jump
back on so no I appreciate it Chris
thank you this is great I love love what
you're doing here this is this is
awesome yet you'd mentioned early on yes
I dm' you about that there was a the nil
thing that we were talking about this is
actually completely different from that
so I'm wanting to get some some I guess
some other feedback from someone else on
an idea that I've I've started that's
about 80 to 90% done it's bootstrapped
and and just would love to hear some
feedback on it basically what it is it's
a service for job Seekers that are
feeling like they are just blending in
in the in the job search and so what I
mean by that is all LinkedIn profiles
look the same you know you can have
different different bullet points on
your LinkedIn profile so on and so forth
but you're really going to blend in
especially right now with with how many
job Seekers there are and so the idea
that I came up with is called called
beyond the page and what this is is a
service where a job seeker can they can

[35:02]
service where a job seeker can they can
go onto our platform which we use a a
thirdparty video recording service
called video ask where they go on and
they can actually do a two-minute video
on each position that they've held so
each experience that they've had they
can do a very quick video that says hey
this is what I did here here's my
successes here's where I excelled you
know so on and so forth so they've got a
video for each one of their experiences
they can also do a video for for their
education and then at the end of it
there is an option if they want to they
can do what is kind of like a mock
interview questions on there that they
can pick and choose from and answer
those questions you know between a
minute and two minutes and what we do on
the back end is we will we take those
videos when they're when they're done we
put them into a professional post-
production I guess if you will have a
Graphic with their name on there and so
on and so forth give it back to them so
they can actually then post it under
each section of their LinkedIn profile

[36:00]
each section of their LinkedIn profile
so if you know in my latest experience I
can post a video of what I did there you
know the the positives all the successes
I had and so they've got a video for
each of their experiences one for their
education and then and then at the top
they can also put that that mock
interview if you will they can also take
that link for that mock interview put it
on their resume if they'd like so a
potential employer can actually instead
of just and I know go it goes through an
ATS system I get that but when a potent
when it reaches a potential employer's
inbox they see the they see the link or
they go to their LinkedIn profile they
can actually see and hear from the job
Seeker as opposed to just looking at
these bullet points and guessing and so
and this stems from you know I was in
Staffing and recruiting for over 20
years and I hired a lot of I hired a lot
of salespeople I interviewed even more
of course and so you don't know until
you don't know what you're getting into
until you actually talk to them and so
the idea is to give these folks an
opportunity to kind of let themselves
stand out from the other job Seekers
that are there you can see and hear from

[37:01]
that are there you can see and hear from
these people and then the the final part
of this is we would have them we would
give them the option if they would like
to we're going to do a or I'd like to do
a beyond the page experience which is a
pod like a video podcast where they can
come on and talk even more about their
experience and in more of a you know
like a talk show type format all of this
would be for $99 for a job Seeker so
they get all of that all of these videos
done and then and then and then the
podcast as well so I'm just interested
to hear your thoughts on that having
with your experience and and obviously
with hiring people all that fun stuff so
would love to love to hear your thoughts
so is it meant to to like is the main
purpose of it to integrate with LinkedIn
or to go outside of LinkedIn like you
were saying which is like the primary
yeah the primary purpose is actually
LinkedIn so there is a space on there
under each experience where you can add
a link for media and it will post
underneath your your under your
experience and it'll show a thumbnail of
that video and the the employers or
anyone can click on that video and watch
that video okay and is it 99 one time or

[38:01]
that video okay and is it 99 one time or
per no 99 one time fee and then from
there after that we each year it'll be
25 bucks to host the videos for them so
so 99 gets you all of the videos done
plus plus hosting for the first year and
then 25 bucks a year after that and what
are you targeting a certain type of role
or a certain industry yeah I so that's
the interesting part I not necessarily
industry specific more of I this would
be huge
in my opinion for sales people sales
people you know they want to talk they
want to you know they they've got to
they've got to be able to articulate you
know what they're selling of course but
it's not necessarily just for
salespeople and that's the big thing
that I that I want to it's such a broad
opportunity for folks that are even in
you know management if you're operating
and and you're an operator you're a
manager and you've got people you need
to be able to you've got to be able to
articulate what you want these folks to
be be doing and and if you can do that
and show show yourself
as well as show your passion show what
your your true colors are to a to a

[39:00]
your your true colors are to a to a
potential employer then that's kind of a
I would consider that to be kind of a
big deal for potential employers as well
as job Seekers to be able to you're
going I mean not to sound you know
you're going beyond the page so it's
beyond the resume beyond the the profile
I guess okay have you tested this yet
not yet I am I am still I'm like I'm
about 80 to 90% done with it and I
bootstrapped it it's not you know it's
not been a big expend but I tend to jump
into things and do them and then and
then research L research later on so not
not a good method but that's what I do
so well that's okay all right so here's
what I would do I would like this week
or next week I would test this in a low
Tech way with five to 10 people have
them like just open up their camera Loom
iPhone whatever and you don't have all
the systems ready yet I get that and so
find five to 10 people that looking for
jobs preferably All In in the same
industry so you can keep that variable
constant and just test it like without

[40:02]
constant and just test it like without
launching without having a full website
ready to go and then like a couple posts
on LinkedIn and just see you you're
gonna have to measure how do you measure
if people are actually clicking on the
video and watching it within LinkedIn
yeah within LinkedIn would it be a third
party tool actually we load the videos
into Vimeo so we can actually can pull
the analytics off of off of
Vimeo okay because
there's you have no way of knowing today
if people actually watch these right and
I said this a couple people ago where I
I very I'm always hesitant on new ideas
because you just don't know and to me
$99 doesn't seem like a lot of money for
you right like I think you either you
need to charge more but the market might
not bear it or you need to Pivot into
something that enables you to charge
more I love the idea of focusing
exclusively on salespeople because
there's a whole industry built around

[41:00]
there's a whole industry built around
selling salespeople because salespeople
directly generate Revenue yep right
where whereas if you focus on anyone
looking for a job then your results are
going to be all over the map but we know
there's already a precedent for people
pay paying a lot of money for a killer
salesperson I think what else you should
do is start with one type of video and
that is call it 30 seconds of the
salesperson let me back up
one type of video but with two segments
so the second segment is going to be
like a two to three minute live
recording of the salesperson selling
whatever it is that he's selling in the
wild like and he can you can curate this
he can pick and choose whichever one it
doesn't matter but it has to be real and
so let's say he sells um Salesforce
right it needs to be a video of him with
audio from both sides like working it
right maybe even it's like a highlight
reel like think of like a like a sports
highlight reel for sales people so it's

[42:00]
highlight reel for sales people so it's
not just one call but it's 5 to 20
second segments of a dozen different
calls all aggregated into one and I'm
sure there's there's a cap cut there's
clap. apppp there's a bunch of like AI
video softwares out there that will
allow you to just upload a bunch of
stuff and it will tie it all together
for 80 bucks a month or whatever and so
the the second segment will just be like
a highlight reel of them selling in the
wild and then the first segment will
just be them intro what they do like hey
my name is John I've been a Salesforce
for three years I'm in the top four% I
made 375 Grand last year I'm about to
show you some clips and this is what I'm
selling I sell their Suite of X Y and Z
tools and I'm really good at this I'm
not so good at this I would love to chat
and then it goes right right into their
highlight reel and then and then you put
that in their in their LinkedIn and then
you watch the analytics on the back end
and see how that performs see if it gets
clean I like like a lot yeah yeah that's
really good yeah then you get to see
them like you said in the wild you

[43:01]
them like you said in the wild you
actually get to see them doing their
thing I guess if you will love that okay
yeah no that's great that is great I
guess as You' mentioned the pricing as
well and I and I you know I toyed with
you obviously we're not live yet but I
toyed with that a little bit and so my
my thought was if you've got a job
Seeker if you got somebody that's out of
work you know you don't I don't want to
gouge them of course you don't want to
go too high but then again you know we
we want to make money at this of course
so I don't
you know providing videos and then
possibly going on to a podcast is that
you think that would justify a higher
price point for these folks I don't like
the podcast idea because I don't think
many people are going to listen to it
okay and I think with the people you're
selling to they're going to realize that
so it won't be much value conveyed but I
do like the idea on the pricing side of
somehow tracking who's viewing their
profile and charging someone at the end
of the transaction either you know the
employer or the employee a multi
thousand fee like it like a a discounted

[44:01]
thousand fee like it like a a discounted
placement fee so to speak right like a
light placement fee as opposed to just a
100 bucks and maybe that's to you know
traditionally to the employer but you'll
have to figure out ways of tracking that
yeah no absolutely that's great that's
great thank you thank you very much
that's that's helpful I'll I will I will
diligently get back to work and and kind
of kind of rework a little bit here so
no that's that's wonder I love it well
let us know how it we do thank you Chris
I appreciate it yep all right hey Heath
yeah the next one we got here is shawam
go ahead and come off hey Heath yeah I
was gonna ask you from now on when you
announce the next caller could you
announce the order of the ones after
that way people can know where they sit
in the quebe yeah no problem so shaan's
next then we have charb wire and then
after that is build for growth cool go
ahead
shaan hi hi Chris hi thank you so much
for doing this I just had a simple
question I just had an idea the other
day just to preface my question I worked
as an investment banking intern at Jake
Moran CH last year I I'm based out of

[45:02]
Moran CH last year I I'm based out of
India so what we the offices we have
here are not the front end offices in
which that we're not the ones actually
pitching to the clients we're kind of a
middle office wherein the administrative
stuff or if the you know the onshore
bankers want to do some kind of they
want some research work done or some
Pitch decks to be made so we are the
guys that do it so with that I thought
you know this can be done for other
things and as well and then I came
across okay virtual assistant agencies
actually do exist so what I want your
opinion on is that since I'm based out
of India the labor here is quite quite
decent in price like I can get people
for about100 to $150 per month who can
work like eight hours a day five days a
week for this kind of stuff stuff to
actually work as virtual agents what I
want to know from you as a business
owner is that is this kind of a business
viable as in would you as a business
owner use the service of virtual agents
and if so what are the potential use

[46:00]
and if so what are the potential use
cases that you can actually use vas for
and what you do you think in accordance
to that would the pricing would be a
good deal for you so are you thinking of
just kind of managing your own small VA
agency there in India and then working
with business owners such as myself that
just need a variety of tasks done good
okay and then what would be your pricing
model would you just like Mark up the
the 150 a month and charge that to the
business owner correct and do you have
like a certain industry that you'd like
to to Target like Investment Banking or
anything anything actually we have there
I I have a few peers in my I'm actually
a student right now I have a friend
whose father actually owns an similar
kind of an agency it's not a VA agency
directly but what it is is like they do
HR payroll and other admin work for
companies and they charge the compan
he's a flat fee and they pay their
employees a flat fee as well and just
make the difference okay so yeah but not

[47:03]
make the difference okay so yeah but not
really fixed in I just wanted to know
from your end okay this is the kind of
what use cases I can potentially tap
into that are actually lucrative for you
yeah so I think this is a great idea
it's a lot of people are doing it and I
think that we're still in the very early
Innings of va agencies especially if you
are yourself overseas that's a
competitive Advantage most aren't most
just working with people like you I
think 100 to 150 a month is outrageous
like I know that's that's Market you
know less than a dollar per hour but I
think that just means that you could be
the cheapest and still mark up your
services a bunch right okay I know a lot
of people have VA agencies that are
focused on like the Philippines or
focused on Pakistan or focused on Latin
America and they do really well I think
that your whole brand could be India
like that's come to India it's more
affordable we work really hard we

[48:00]
affordable we work really hard we
specialize in XYZ and then if if your
Niche or if your brand is India and it's
funny to call that a niche because
there's like a billion and a half people
there then the the services that you
offer can be all over the map and that
might not be Niche enough you might want
to be graphic designers in India for 400
a month you know flat fee unlimited
graphic design there are companies
charging 30 40 times that 10,000 a month
5,000 a month and companies pay it it's
going to be eras to the bottom on
pricing so okay I would you know
everyone wants to be the cheapest no one
wants to be the most expensive I would
Embrace cheapest honestly I I would go
that route I know a guy do doing that
same model and he's doing really well so
I like it okay just to reiterate my
previous question I really like your
opinion on this but in particular as you
I read about you know you have a tree
Biz and whatnot in accordance to let's
say for example you I am you know
pitching to customers who have similar

[49:00]
pitching to customers who have similar
smbs so what kind of a service would you
think okay if I Outsource this for to
someone for like $4 $500 a month that
can be very helpful for me are you
facing similar kind of a problem that
you know can potentially be solved by VA
cheaply yeah my problem is I just have
like five different vas doing five
different things all working part-time
and so if someone were to approach me
and say hey I I will be your sole point
of contact I know you have five
different needs only interface through
me because I have five you know snipers
at all five of those things and I'll
interface with them I'll be your
middleman you'll charge less you'll have
four or less people to interface with or
you'll pay less you'll have four or less
people to interface with and I will be
the one like I'll be your VA CEO I'll be
the one to make sure that all of your
jobs get done that way you're not
holding five people accountable you're
holding me accountable and I'm seeing to
it that it gets done so maybe that's
kind of the brand is the VA CEO right

[50:03]
kind of the brand is the VA CEO right
you're just playing that middleman layer
between a busy entrepreneur and you know
two to 10 vas that makes a lot of sense
thank you so much for your time Chris
absolutely good luck right thank you so
much thanks Shan Char wire you're up and
the next after that is build for growth
hey everybody can you hear me yes sir
awesome Chris thank you for having me so
I have a couple of things I'd like to
ask you so basically I have like two
parts to this question one is my main
background is merchant services in point
of sale that's like where the majority
of my income comes from my family used
to run a recreation center where my
mother at one point started a trophy and
awards business where we do laser
engraving sublimation Awards of all
kinds when they retired I bought the
business from them with seller financing
of course basically I was super ready to
just about move this business and and
take it to the Next Level and then I got
a text message in the middle of the
spring during the pandemic saying that

[51:00]
spring during the pandemic saying that
school would be closed for the rest of
the year that was just something I had
never anticipated but at this point like
things are going pretty well during the
during the pandemic we decided we would
get a better online presence we would
collect some Google reviews just knowing
that look there's always going to be a
need to award and recognize achievement
these these events and things will come
back and when things come back online we
want to have a good digital presence to
capture that audience so far that has
kind of worked but basically it's the
8020 rule right it's like the majority
of my income is coming from my other
business that the amount of effort I put
into keep the other business running
versus the amount of effort I put into
this business it made more sense to
focus most of my efforts on point of
sale but at this point I really
passionate about the awards business
like I love laser engraving I love the
creativity behind it I like working with
those people the end product it's it's
not exactly as crowded of a space as the
point of sale merchant services space so
like basically at this point like my
number one question would be like I'm
looking at how to scale this where it's
not something super local it's it kind

[52:01]
not something super local it's it kind
of like you know it's still named after
my mom's you know name the name that she
named the business because that was on
our advertising that's on like the
stickers that are on the back of all the
plaques and trophies so honestly like
one of my questions would be like like
just looking for some ideas of like how
I could scale this business rename it
and make it something that's not like
that's a little more Broad and not like
local to our area and beyond that I have
like another like I've found a couple of
areas where like like for instance in
the trophy business like yes some of
this stuff can be done on e-commerce yes
some of this stuff can be done on Amazon
but some of it does take a little while
for the personalization some of it is
heavy so there's some Logistics and I
think I found and like identified some
friction like in the ordering process so
like I have some ideas on like how I've
like gone out to Market and
differentiated our s from you know
someone just going online and and buying
them anywhere so really like my my my
question would be like around like just
some suggestions on like how I could
name this so it's like a little bit

[53:01]
name this so it's like a little bit
broader than you know my local market
and then I had like some random other
stuff happen so like my second I don't
know if you want to like respond to that
or if you want to hear my other part of
the question but like in trying to
figure out like how to differentiate
ourselves and where we make margin and
what works and like what we want to
focus on you know like we have a couple
of MVP products that like are high
margin easy for us to deliver but the
problem with the trophy business is also
that like there are thousands and
thousands of SKS so like not everybody
is looking for the type of MVP products
that we sell which are like plaques and
metals right like personalized plaques
and metals within that I have found some
really cool areas where I'm focusing
where I've gotten like for instance like
I live in Saratoga Springs where there's
a famous horse racing track and I have
an exclusive deal with the museum racing
Hall of Fame and I produce the reprint
plaques for all the Hall of Fame horses
like seis and secretar and man of war
right and I have the exclusive ability

[54:00]
right and I have the exclusive ability
to sell those in their store and online
so like these are some ways that I found
some ways to differentiate myself and
maybe have some recurring Revenue where
it's not just like we're sitting around
waiting for the phone to to to to ring
from a previous customer or a school or
a booster club right so like those are
some ways I'm growing it but I have this
random things so like this is where like
I kind of wanted to ask you about this
so like this is where kind of thinking
out loud one of the phone calls I get
constantly is do you recycle
trophies generally the answer is no
because they changed the you know
someone who who got something 10 years
ago that particular supplier may not
make that part number anymore or I need
12 of them and they only have three so
there's really no reason for me to
onboard that you know take them and put
them in my inventory on the shelves in
the back right but sometimes I do
entertain that and this is what brings
me to this like where this light bulb
went off of my head is not long ago this
a new a tenant called me from like a
strip mall down the road they were

[55:01]
strip mall down the road they were
taking over a space to put in this dog
food store well what was previously in
there was a karate instruction school
and the karate instruction school had
tons and tons of like trophies and the
guy was like do you want to come over
here and take a look at I'm like you
know what I normally don't do this but
let's take a look at them and what I
found was like they had a lot of these
really large like Larger than Life three
poost you know four or five foot tall
trophies all geared for karate which I
can very easily take the tops off and
make them into a basketball trophy or
make them into you know a golf trophy so
I did take some of these trophies from
this guy and I ended up reselling them
did you buy them or take them I got them
for free okay so essentially I was like
um maybe there's something here and what
did you sell them for so the interesting
part about this business like the margin
is pretty good in the trophy business
right it's like there is some like work
to do like I do have a laser engraver
I've got overhead but the margin is
generally pretty good and it's not
exactly super crowded so like these

[56:00]
exactly super crowded so like these
trophies especially the larger ones go
for sometimes over $100 a piece so it's
like now what I was doing is like hey
look now I think I am interested in
recycling trophies so long as they're
like that type of trophy where I can
have it on the Shelf here and then use
it at the right time you know and I just
did this recently someone just you know
they're cleaning out their daughter's
bedroom and they found three Larger than
Life gorgeous trophies and she was just
going to throw them away but she didn't
but now sitting here in my shop ready to
be retooled and resold to another
customer as long as they're in good
shape right if they're in not great
shape then there's nothing I can do so
you know part of me is like you know how
how can I come up with a way to make a
business idea out of this problem I get
this phone call all the time you know
they're literally giving me free
inventory what is what is all the time
like can you put some numbers to that uh
you know I'd have to go back and look at
my phone program just to see but like
quite honestly a couple times a month
someone calls up and asks that they you
know they've got a ton of trophies
they're going to throw them out would
you like to recycle them is there a way
I can recycle them before I throw them

[57:01]
I can recycle them before I throw them
out because obviously some people are
conscious consumers right they just
don't want to see the thing thrown right
in the trash and they have inherent
value right so like some people just
have like a sentimental value attached
to them so the first thing they do is
try to see if it could be repurposed
instead of thrown right in the garbage
so I normally just like did not even
take those phone calls but now that I've
had a couple of instances where I've
gotten some good product out of it and
it's not like that's what we're trying
to sell right it's like repurpose
trophies like I want people to buy the
beautiful plaques and the Beautiful
metals that we make that are custom but
those trophies you know I have a miter
saw I've got all these things they do
take like some effort to put together
they're kind of a pain in the butt to be
perfectly honest so if I have someone
come in and have like three Larger than
Life trophies that are all worth like A1
to $200 a piece and I don't even have to
build them other than literally putting
a new figure on them and using my laser
engraver to make a new plate to
repurpose them I thought that was cool
but it kind of got me into like thinking
what if I take these others you know
what if I take everybody's trophies and
there's a and there's a way to like go

[58:01]
there's a and there's a way to like go
through the marble and the lead and the
plastic and the stuff in them and see if
there's like a local recycler a local
garbage company that might be able to
put a value on that and I just thought
there's there's literally people
offering me the free product like is
there I can monetize this and I found
out one way to do it but not quite sure
how to harness or figure out the rest
and this is just like one facet of it
right like ideally I just want to sell
people like the custom licensed plaques
and the metals and the Beautiful
products they make right but yeah you
know these people are calling up a
couple times a month and in the case of
the karate store the karate store had a
ton you know I threw away quite a bit of
them but there were a few that were
ideal to keep what percentage would you
say are are recyclable on average not
just the karate store but on
average not not quite a not a lot of
them you know like that's that's where I
think the brainstorming has gone to like
okay like if these have Mar on them and
these have certain like other recyclable
materials what is that worth to
Scrapyard or somewhere else you know

[59:00]
Scrapyard or somewhere else you know
like essentially since it's like quote
unquote dirty right like if you brought
like aluminum or copper somewhere they'd
be like this is dirty if it's connected
to something else okay so last question
is what like what is the revenue size if
you're comfortable of of this business
so this business is like you know it's
kind of my side hustle I hate to call it
that but like you know last year we did
about $90,000 in Revenue in sales and I
you as far as a percentage of that that
all being recycled trophies that was all
just new new new sales and you know
existing prod the products I normally
sell generally I'm turning away the
people saying can I recycle the trophies
like I already have not enough space to
keep my inventory and the things I keep
on the shelves so you know I don't want
to take on someone's dancing trophy that
is sitting here you know and sits there
for six months before I find a way to
repurpose it but yeah what I do want to
do is like essentially at this rate be
like hey we do recycle trop you know
please inquire you know if they look
like this or they're like this we're
interested if they're not we're not but

[1:00:01]
interested if they're not we're not but
even the ones we not I'm like is there
recycle these like is there a way to
like scrap these because people are
literally calling me up to give me free
inventory you know so okay how can I
monetize it you know all right so here's
my prescription so I'll tell you what I
like and don't like about it what I
don't like about it is that it's it's
going to be really hard to scale I'm
looking up your city and doesn't look
like there's you've got a bigger city
just south of you but it's just you know
$1 to $200 Topline and you got to you
got to get it you got to throw away a
bunch of them you got to pull out the
miter saw you got to put some work into
it what I do like about it is there
there are ways around that I think you
could have a lot of success doing like
trophy recycling drives at the
elementary school or the high school or
or whatever it is where you work with
the school directly they send out in an
email or in a flyer hey bring in your
old trophies we're going to recycle them
and then you can just drive once to go
pick up hundreds or dozens of these
things
and then you literally go straight by
The Dump throw away the ones that you
can't recycle keep the ones that you can

[1:01:01]
can't recycle keep the ones that you can
and now your cogs goes way down because
maybe that's a third like maybe you you
reduce what you're buying by a third
with that right and now the the the
parents get to feel good that their kids
trophy isn't completely going to waste
and if you throw it away that's a shame
but they were going to throw it away
anyway there's nothing you can do with
it so does that make sense I I like that
but I don't like that for those reasons
yeah I I I do think that makes sense and
it's like this isn't like you know the
sole focus of my business I also don't
want someone to see that like we re they
recognize a trophy that it was recycled
and repurposed and like that's the type
of product we sell you know that's true
this was this was just a way to do that
but I do like the idea of bottlenecking
it almost like an electronics recycling
drive or like when they do it with
Pharmaceuticals or something like that
where people like they're they feel like
they're doing something good and it's
like free advertising for us right I
mean like if people are Googling us
they're finding us and asking us this
question like you know trying to turn
that into some some way that they'd
probably keep us in mind when they do
need new product Yeah well yeah that's

[1:02:00]
need new product Yeah well yeah that's
what I like about it but I I've got your
your website pulled up I won't say it
out loud because I don't know if you
want people to know but I'm pretty sure
I found it I think you should update
your website you probably already know
that but I kind of have a creative idea
that I think you should try and then
we've got to go because there's two
people waiting and we're almost out of
time I think you should make a Tik Tok
Channel doing very funky funny like
hilarious Engravings right like take
your dad's favorite mug and then put
like an inside like engrave an inside
joke on it and be sure to show in the
short form video like the actual laser
engraving process because people love
seeing cool stuff like that so I think
you could have you could get a lot of
clicks and a lot of eyeballs on the
hilarity of you know a kid engraving
their mom or their Grandma's X Y and Z
and then them noticing it one day like
engraving a toilet or putting a plaque
on a toilet right like Dad's second home
or something and then so you get the the
funny aspect and then you get the the

[1:03:01]
funny aspect and then you get the the
interesting aspect when you actually
show it being laser engraved I think
that would crush on reals YouTube shorts
and Tik Tok and it could drive a lot of
traffic to your site that you could you
know you could do e-commerce traffic all
over the country that all derives from
these short form videos but that all
starts with you kind of redesigning and
updating your Shopify site yes so sh I I
agree with you that we do need to update
Shopify that was something we did during
the pandemic I do have another part to
the site that's not customer facing
that's actually connected to like all my
suppliers it's it's much more robust
it's just it also it's almost like
Shopify and Salesforce had like a small
child it's a little bit more intense to
look at so like that's what I'm really
going to switch over to have people do
it all my suppliers have everything all
their SKS and pricing all loaded into it
it allows people to share it's it's a
little bit more robust than Shopify so
that's definitely not the one we wanted
to share with people but like quite
honestly on Instagram I've done like
with the laser engraver what's kind of
cool is like essentially doing like U

[1:04:01]
cool is like essentially doing like U
time-lapse videos where it just shows
really quickly like the thing and I've
gotten a lot of you know like that's not
what I'm entirely using Instagram for
but like when I share things like that
in my stories I I tend to get interest
so I do like the idea of I have not made
a Tik Tok yet but that's I've been
somewhat Tik Tock resistant but I guess
it's like hard to ignore like the size
of the market there if you're making the
content you might as well put it
everywhere but we're going to move on to
the next person and I hope this helps
awesome thanks for having me these are
pretty cool to listen to good thank you
all right go ahead growth build for
growth you're up cool all right thank
you folks Chris thanks for for hosting
this so yeah so what I'm doing is is a
little is a little out there I think
just generally from a few mentors that
I've spoken with you know I think the
general idea is like you should only do
one thing my background is in marketing
I've done marketing for almost 13 years
now I do growth at a pretty big start up
right now I I lead up growth and I'm
also a fractional CMO at like two
smaller startups one of them is one of

[1:05:01]
smaller startups one of them is one of
them is kind of like that VA CEO thing
you were talking about but generally
what I'm looking for is is information
about or kind of like your input on
everything else that I'm doing which is
I guess at this point it's kind of like
a Dev shop or I call it a startup studio
so in the past six months I've been kind
of I started eight months ago finding
talent and kind of like finding Talent
that's part-time designer developers
product managers and we've we've we've
built and launched four products either
seing traction and so I'm coming at it
from like a growth growth marketing
perspective or strategy which is you
know don't put all your eggs in one
basket split test and and and look for
signals and I'm looking to like scale up
this whole thing pretty much not scale
up each product per se but scale up the
product development process and I'm I'm
looking for like bootstrapped growth and
so you know I'm only going to scale up a
product when when the you know when the
return on ad spend or the return on
investment and so until then it's like

[1:06:01]
investment and so until then it's like
organic and you know low volume low
volume keywords pretty much that I can
actually bid on and and make it make
sense and so I guess I'm trying to
figure out like I I don't want to seek
in investors in the traditional sense I
want to seek out investors for the
bootstrap of building products and and
bootstrap growth from there and I guess
I'm trying to I'm trying to hear like
any thoughts on how I could go about
doing that probably only looking for you
know like a a very low six figure
investment and you know it's like you
know most people want to hear about how
can I do how can I invest in something
that's going to be worth a billion
dollars and so yeah I'm trying to think
of like ways to do that you know mostly
I've just been investing my own money
right now and and I'd like to you know
I'd like to you know offset that so that
I can increase the pace and maybe
increase the quality of of the
contractors that I have so what what
would the Investor's Capital be going
towards like ad spend no just just it

[1:07:02]
towards like ad spend no just just it
would only go towards paying the
contractors the contractors yeah I mean
I guess like a very small amount would
go for for marketing testing and I would
continue to invest my own money so I I'm
really looking like supplement my own
investment and what types of products
would you be building like what
industries give me an example of a
company or a product you build yeah so
so for example one of them is is is for
like job Seekers one of them is like an
AI product on the App Store little
little kind of micro SAS micras yeah
exactly okay and do you have any case
studies of like ones that you've
incubated and you've self-funded and how
it went like how much money you put in
and and what that turned into yeah I do
I mean you know we we really just barely
launched started launching them about a
month ago and we're seeing traction
obviously it's not like rapid growth but
I I I don't plan to abandon any of the
these products my plan is to on an
ongoing basis continue to Pivot and
improve them until I I find you know

[1:08:00]
improve them until I I find you know
until until they truly resonate with the
marketplace and I see some opportunities
for investing to achieve growth so I
think what you need to do is you know
the the thought that investors are
looking for billion dollar exits is true
in certain circles I think you need to
go after more local smalltime investors
small business owners people that have
net worths in the low you know seven
figures that are comfortable writing1 to
$50,000 checks and I would make the
terms very agreeable to them and just
put front and center like the best two
or three projects you've worked on how
much money was invested what that turned
into on a cash flow or an equity basis
those are your case studies even if
there's only one make the terms very
favorable to the investor don't go after
investors that are typically Angel
Investors into moonshot like angel.com
typee products go after the Local H fact
business owner that makes 600 Grand a
year go after those guys that you know
in your own immediate circle that
already know and trust you and put one

[1:09:02]
already know and trust you and put one
deal together 200 Grand 100 Grand and
then just put everything you have into
that that way you can have an even
better case study of not just what you
built and what it turned into but what
you built with investors capital and
what you turn and what you turned it
into because the first deal is by far
the hardest but if you can knock it out
of the park then it will be easy from
that point on but if you start with kind
of not investor friendly terms then it's
going to be a lot harder to get that
first deal under your belt yeah so like
as far as like people that I know more
closely I probably you know you know
like you said probably 10 to 50, is is
what I would be comfortable asking for
and and and so then it's like well how
do I scale beyond that I mean you know
what you're saying kind of makes sense
like you know maybe just hustle and just
pick up the phone and call some
people I I don't I don't know how else
to go about like finding those people
without without doing something like
that
I think you have to I think you hit the
nail on the head pick up the phone it's
a lot easier to to say no over an email

[1:10:01]
a lot easier to to say no over an email
than it is over the phone yeah that
makes sense all right cool thanks so
much yep thanks well we'll we'll go with
the last two we got Mike and Ross and
then after that we will wrap this up
cool I think Ross you're up first oh I'm
up first I had a question for him but
I'll ask him later so for those of you
that don't know my name is Ross I run a
uh sales for consultancy name pong
Solutions it's growing very rapidly
sometimes at a scary pace so we're
dealing with all those fun problems but
the thing that I struggle with is I have
super sh shiny object syndrome so we
actually had a few products that we
built out of some Consulting work that
we've done that we're going to launch to
the marketplace pretty soon and that's
that's pretty good I got an operator in
there but I think my question is it
actually is on the same wavelength as
the last person which is I guess it's a
two-part question you know how do you

[1:11:00]
two-part question you know how do you
keep yourself focused on kind of growing
the cash cow but also positioning
yourself for kind of transforming from
an operator to I guess an investor or
basically starting a larger scale
business this is actually a issue that I
face right now where there's a lot of
self-doubt with something that I really
really want to do that's going to
require me going to investors and
basically pitching them on millions of
dollars and it's a very solid idea but I
don't want it to distract from what's in
front of me basically so hopefully that
kind of makes sense makes perfect sense
it's like you're you're talking to the
king of shiny object syndrome right now
and I I'm very public about that so I
get it but there's the mess you're in
the messy middle or you have to get past
the messy middle and you have to get to
the place where you can hire a CEO for
pong Solutions and feel very comfortable
in the fact that he's doing at least 80%

[1:12:02]
in the fact that he's doing at least 80%
or 70% as good of a job as you are doing
like you either have to do that you have
to hire someone I don't know what your
profits are even if it means you're
giving him 30 70 whatever it takes
percent of the profits to run the
business if you really do feel
passionate about this next idea that
that's what you have to do because what
investor wants to give a bunch of money
to someone that you know has shiny
object syndrome yeah speaking from
experience so if if is your is pong at
the level where you could I think this
year will be the first step towards that
basically I think where we're at right
now is so for those of you that don't
know the way that my business operates
is it's I usually get a lot of leads
from Salesforce so I have to hop on
calls with them so I'm the guy doing the
sales but I've gotten myself out of the
delivery aspect so we have have that
delegated out it's managed well until I
get myself out of the sales end where
I've trained somebody up on how to run

[1:13:02]
I've trained somebody up on how to run
that I'm kind of stuck in this position
so this year I think we're kind of at
that cost but I also I got to be careful
too because of how the business works so
I from my perspective our profitability
allows for this it's just it's a
question of more like when instead of if
at this point
yeah well in my experience if you hire a
CEO there they're going to do either 70%
as good of a job as you or 200% right
and you're just going to be shocked and
be like wow this guy's a killer I think
either for in your scenario either
option is fine but if you're if you're
selling Salesforce like there's got to
be a bunch of people out there that can
do it maybe not super well but at least
that have you won't have to train them
on Salesforce or even train them on
selling Salesforce I I got to think that
you could Outsource the sales side of
that as well it's actually interesting
you bring that up because so the the

[1:14:00]
you bring that up because so the the
common common career path for sales
force a is either upward in the company
to RVP level which is like five jumps or
you flame out and become a sales rapid a
partner so I get all resumes all the
time of these X Salesforce a but that's
actually not what I want I would rather
so in my opinion I'm going to say
something different than what you said
but I think the person needs to know
Salesforce at least from a technical
side but they also need to learn how
to conceptualize some of the concepts a
client is talking about and apply to
their business because that's the secret
formula of what I do that's winning so
that person is actually an EXC
consultant or somebody that works under
me that I can train on the sales process
they have a personality they're great
with people so that's easy to find
overall is what I'm saying so it's a
little bit because the other the other
guys I compete with have these de Sales

[1:15:01]
guys I compete with have these de Sales
for sedes that are just terrible at sell
it so yeah yeah well I think you know
what you need to do so I wish you the
best all right cool I'll go tell Mr ol
man that I need to go hire a CEO
so there you go all right thanks guys
thank you Ross cool Mike your last but
not
least it might be least that's all right
what's up Chris how are you sir what's
up Mike good how are you speaking of
shiny objects I'll get your blood
flowing here on this Friday so to just
kind of idea
Childs I posted yesterday about this
idea of like Carfax for home sales yep I
originally posted about renters and
stuff but I think like is there a market
for that like where an somebody could
just pull a report of insurance claims
roofs that's been done HVAC work
anything that you could just literally
pull a $200 report on a house that
you're looking to buy it might end up

[1:16:00]
you're looking to buy it might end up
putting home inspectors out of business
but it's just an interesting idea I want
to get your take on that first so you're
asking if I think there's a demand for
people to pay for Carfax for homeowners
yeah I think so where would you get the
data from I I think that would be the
uphill battle of having to create I mean
you'd almost have to create a place
where like with cars anytime you worked
on something you're almost required to
report it to a to a reporting service
and then that just becomes an aggregated
amount of data between plumbers HVAC
roofers insurance would probably be the
easiest and first option because anytime
a a a home owner makes a claim there's a
database of that so that seems like a
easy first step with any major type
stuff but then all the other mini little
repairs you'd almost have to create a
system where they report it and they're
almost bound to report it you know what
I

[1:17:00]
I
mean okay I think that's a big challenge
that's a big challenge it it is a
challenge but what I like about the
challenge and I was just talking about
this an hour ago is you're you're
familiar with the company plaid that
connects all the banking infrastructure
yeah all the bank stuff exactly yeah
like connect Veno to Bank of America
uses plaid right so what is amazing
about plad is that they spent years just
pounding the pavement hitting the
streets going to all these little credit
unions and Community Banks that have no
apis they don't even know what API
stands for and like building it out yeah
right that and today that's why they're
like a 10 billion dollar company is
because they have that moat and yes
they've got some great Tech under the
hood but really their moat is the fact
that they spent a lot of money just one
by one by one by one building all all
these little Integrations and so I love
the idea of building a plaid for x or
plaid for y and I would start in like a

[1:18:02]
plaid for y and I would start in like a
very small community that has like four
HVAC guys two roofers six Plumbing guys
or whatever and it's going to be tough
because you're gonna have to have Buy in
and I would take like the top three most
expensive or damaging repairs maybe even
like a foundation repair company and
saying hey for I don't know what you've
got to give the business owner something
but for XY or Z offer I would like you
to give me just a list of addresses with
a list of repairs and cost in this area
over the last five years and I I I don't
have the time to think of like what is
in it for them right right you've gota
you've got to solve for that something's
got to be in it for them maybe a REV
share or something yeah maybe that's it
maybe every time you sell one of these
you give 10% of it to that business
owner or something but that's going to
be tedious but once you have that then
you go to the real estate agents and

[1:19:01]
you go to the real estate agents and
every time they get something under
contract it's an upsell right like right
alongside the inspection they put this
Carfax it's like gap insurance it's like
you got to pay for it but what the heck
does it cover really right or I wonder
even if you could go directly to the
home inspectors and say like can I buy
your data right right like they're not
going to know like if if a house you
know replace the HVAC well actually a
lot of the home inspectors use a
software platform to do their home
inspection so you'd go to that company
because then you'd be able to aggregate
it on a much higher level you know what
I mean yeah yeah yeah and if you could
like somehow like aggregate that data
use like Claude or an llm or some AI
tool to spit out something clean then
you could use that to to to put on like
an address LEL basis right like the
address is your is your source of Truth
this this other quick one might be a
little bit better I want to get you so

[1:20:01]
little bit better I want to get you so
take Zillow like residential sales or
searches for homes you go to Zillow you
go to redin you go to realtor whatever
it may be right commercial you go to
loopet or kxy or any of those platforms
if you're a person right now and you're
like Chris you're like I want to build a
brand new house I don't know where to
start I I just want to build a house I
don't necessarily want to buy a brand
new house I want to build one my own
where do you go for that like a custom
home from scratch it could be it could
be a a spec builder in your area or a
custom home right where do you go like
right now my only option I think is
Google home new home construction
builders in Fillin the blank s city
right yeah well I I mean I've done this
we built our own custom home eight years
ago and it's we're live in a city of
7,000 and there's like six Builders here
and we just started talking to our
friends and family and it became very
clear that there was only one option we
went with that guy I just think go ahead

[1:21:01]
went with that guy I just think go ahead
how like would how be for that I think
how could integrate with the idea but my
thought is like imagine Zillow meets
like Pinterest meets Instagram where you
have a map of the United States and then
you're going to have your different
areas so like let's click on Wisconsin
and then you have your big Metro areas
of Wisconsin and the consumer will
figure out their area like let's say
Green Bay where I'm at right on the back
end of that you've done the leg work and
connected with all the builders who are
associated with the Home Builders
Association in those areas who will
build right and then you get them to
send you I think with AI this can
actually work well they'll send you
pictures of all of their builds interior
exterior all that right now you're
creating an experience for the user
they're saying hey I'm in Green Bay I I
want a two-story house okay great now
we'll filter in all the twostory houses
I want all these different things and
you're filtering in you're looking

[1:22:00]
you're filtering in you're looking
through pictures you double tap everyone
that you like so now the AI is building
what you tend to lean towards as far as
style right then at the end of this user
experience it says oh these are your top
three choices for types of homes you
like and then would you like to see the
builders in your area that build these
exact homes yes or no and then and they
choose that uh they they say yes and
then all of a sudden it sells this lead
to three builders in that area and then
you're picking your Builder you're
choosing based on the product that
they've put out and you can go there to
it's just kind of like a database of the
builders their products and then people
are trying to match themselves with the
builder I think it could be cool because
Builders you could also have websites
that you build off of it for the
builders because they're notoriously
horrible for having any type of digital
presence right so what are your thoughts
there so I'm thinking more of a lowtech
solution where because what's great

[1:23:02]
solution where because what's great
about Builders is it's such a high
ticket item that there's there's a lot
of money to be made right and a lot a
lot of these Builders pay three to six
perent to a real estate agent and I know
Builders hate real estate agents right
because it's like well that's why a lot
of in house too because they want to
keep right right it's it's such a low
margin High head business and then like
some yahoo comes around and just makes
an introduction and makes 70 grand
whereas the Builder does all this work
and so they're already used to paying
that and so what if you were it was a
very low Tech solution High touch low
Tech but high margin High ticket of just
I would pick one market I would name it
something Broad and generic because
you're not going to stay one market but
let's say it's Green Bay and then you
just you scrape a database of all the
builders let's say there's 20 of them
and you just learn everything you can
Havoc VA go through and like how long
have they been in business like every
single shred of data you can get on all

[1:24:00]
single shred of data you can get on all
the builders in Green Bay and then you
start building out the SEO like you just
want inbound SEO like you're like a Lead
genen Factory and the landing page is
very simple you just want their email
and the pitch is like Hey we're like a a
builder broker and you have no reason
this is speaking to the homeowners you
have no reason to not use us because you
don't pay us like there's only upside to
using us we are paid by the Builder and
they're used to paying a realtor 6%
they're going to pay us 1% or 2% so like
everyone's happy right but you're not a
realtor you're you're a brokerage and so
they put in their email that's it you
you got their email and then it sends
them to a type form or something a lot
more exhaustive where it captures every
sh of data as they enter it so if they
never complete the form because it's a
big form then you still have some data
on them and it's just just asking like
all right what's your square footage
like what are you looking for what type
of build is like colonial style or you
know whatever and you're getting all

[1:25:01]
know whatever and you're getting all
this data and then you get just a killer
you know person salesperson to get that
homeowner on the phone and just like
start to build a relationship like a
realtor would do and then it's like oh
okay yeah I'm thinking this guy might be
good oh that you know what this Builder
he just built a house right around the
corner they's gorgeous like oh y y and
then they just they just start playing
Matchmaker and then get the builders to
sign referral agreements and you just
ignore the ones that are crappy and you
know of the 20 Builders you might only
get three four or five that are willing
to sign referral agreements and then you
just start sending in business and you
know a year later you're you it's going
to take a year to build the pipeline but
you make five figure checks from every
Bild yeah and then you expand other you
build it from there copy and paste yeah
yeah I already bet that's kind of we
have build greenbay.com or build GB one
of the two I don't remember that'd be a
great place to start probably perfect
yeah I like that idea cool man good
