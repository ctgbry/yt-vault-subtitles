welcome to the ker office the only
podcast where we discuss business ideas
business launch ideas business growth
ideas and business business business
today's Friday and you know what that
means that means it's time for HG Bros
with me and my partner Nick heski and we
discussed three things today we talked
about a an update for our perfume
vending machine business we had a good
month in August we talked about a
carfare idea specifically two to four
different ways where you can monetize in
the used car business without having to
buy used cars or actually be in the used
car business and the the last idea we
talked about is like growth hacking
social media apps or students or it's
kind of unique but I think you're going
to like it so part part two of this
episode will be next week on next Friday
uh go check that out as well please like
subscribe share with your friends and
your grandma and I love you
[Music]
bye all right so as many of you know I
posted a video in July about a perfume
vending machine it went viral we
contacted the manufacturer and said hey
we want to be the exclusive North
American distributor after much back and

[01:00]
American distributor after much back and
forth we're now selling perfume vending
machines which was not on our bingo card
for
2024 and in our first full month August
we sold 19 machines for a total of
$72,000 at about 40ish per gross margin
50% gross is somewhere in there less
than that but that's okay what what are
our gross margins then 35 okay but it's
a high ticket item back of the napkin
we're talking 23 $24,000 of grow gross
profit the first month in business
before we pay our sales guy and our
expenses not bad and it will be more
than that our pricing was a little bit
messed up so we were only charging a
margin on the machine itself but there
are upsale not upsale but there are
other models that you can choose like it
takes a card or it takes a bill reader
or it takes coins or it takes some
combination of those things or it's on a
stand or it has a TV and every
additional add-on we were just passing
through at cost so that dropped our
gross margin down pretty significantly

[02:00]
gross margin down pretty significantly
but once we fix that pricing yeah we
should be in the 45 and the currency
fluctuations that's been the other weird
thing is like they price everything in
euros and they've just started invoicing
Us in dollars and we have a static price
on our website off percentage points
upwards of 10% but we're like okay well
how do we account for that do we just
need to update every quarter do we
update every month do we just kind of
let it be uh so that's one of the things
that we're trying to figure out at the
moment I'm just smiling because I'm
thinking of a bit that could happen
right here if we were more organic than
we are and I could be like man other
currencies who knew if only they taught
us that in business school and then
you'd be like Chris first of all they
did teach us that in business school
second of all you should know that you
just should know that Chris you've
worked internationally haven't you like
how how did you pay people in China oh I
paid them with Bitcoin I paid them with
Bitcoin that's not another currency
though that's an that's why we kept
getting scammed actually oh
gosh still some things we got to figure
out we just heard a second sales guy who

[03:00]
out we just heard a second sales guy who
seems to be a rockstar we're very
excited about him so now we have two
full-time sales guys we're setting up
our systems but the TBD is how do these
machines actually work will they be
delivered on time will they break is it
a scam we feel pretty good about it am I
gay why would you say that no I mean
like we're just being totally trans here
right we're just letting people see
behind the kimono yeah there's a couple
things we have placed these orders I
mean we're confident but it's also like
none of the machines have been delivered
yet so that's a question mark we also
have we've had over like 2500 leads but
our lead tracking and follow-up system
stinks and so like currently
everything's in otter Ai and we're
trying to get it transitioned to HubSpot
but HubSpot and Otter AI don't have an
integration and so we don't really have
a good idea of where people have been in
the pipeline so like there's a ton of
opportunity for us to optimize which is
why we brought on this other sales guy
like I'm very excited for September in
October but yeah there's still some

[04:01]
October but yeah there's still some
there's definitely things that we need
to figure out but I would say net
$70,000 in our first month of sales it's
pretty awesome it's pretty pretty
awesome to have done that it just
reminds me of that like SNL or not SNL
Seinfeld sketch where the yada yada y
like yeah so I posted a video and yada
yada yada we did $70,000 last month
we're
billiones in all seriousness we are
trying to share the behind the scenes
the ACT sexuality like what gets ugly
after the sexy virality so we're
learning in real time one thing that
we've learned is it's much easier to
sell to an end user of the machine AKA a
gas station owner or gym owner that
wants to place them himself on property
that he already owns or herself it's
much easier to sell it to that person
than it is to an enterprising
entrepreneur that wants to place it
because they want to go do research they
want to do studies they want to go stand
outside a gym and talk to people and say
would you pay a dollar for this and
friction equals time time equals dead

[05:00]
friction equals time time equals dead
deals yeah that's the other thing that
people have been like trying to figure
out is where should I place these
machines if I do place them in a good
spot how much money am I going to make
and there's the manufacturers sort of
FAQs that tell people what to expect but
they want to talk to other owners and
we've got to put them in touch with
other owners spoiler aler there's no
other owners in the United States like
they're in Europe they don't necessarily
speak English so like we're trying to
figure all this stuff out on the Fly
that's why I'm like $770,000 in our
first month in spite of all those
obstacles I'm I am bullish yep yep all
right I've got an idea can I lead us out
absolutely okay I told you about this
idea years ago and you'll probably
remember it but we didn't ever really go
deep on it you'll like this idea because
this hails from your hometown well
Sactown Sao okay Sacramento NorCal okay
okay okay the Sierra AutoFair does that
ring a bell no okay so you're listening
Sierra College uhhuh yeah it's tell them

[06:02]
Sierra College uhhuh yeah it's tell them
the parking lot yes yes yes yes yep you
remember this idea I do I mean no but so
this is a great idea because a lot of
ideas we talk about it's very
approachable and you don't need much
money at all to start this so the idea
is this you play middleman between a
business or organization or university
that has a big parking lot and a bunch
of consumers that own a car that want to
sell that car so what you do is let's
say there's a community college or High
School scho right let's just use Allan
Texas as an example tell them what this
is first I'm getting there I'm getting
there so Allen High School is one of the
biggest high schools in the country they
have a massive parking lot and of course
the parking lot's really only used
Monday through Friday aside from the
occasional football game so what Sierra
AutoFair is it's named after the
community college in the area and it is
an AutoFair where anyone that has a car
that they want to sell will go to the
parking lot of the Community College on
the weekend after paying about $149 to
SI autoair and they will have a parking

[07:02]
SI autoair and they will have a parking
lot or a parking spot reserved for them
with a number they'll show up they'll
fill out a form they'll scan a QR code
they'll Park their car they'll leave
their keys with an attendant and then
they'll come back two days later to pick
their car up while they're gone other
potential car buyers will show up to
this AutoFair for free there's no
admission fee and they go they look
around they shop and they can take it on
a test drive if the car owner wants to
leave their keys some don't and then
it's great because you don't have to go
through the used car buying experience
you can go directly through a seller
it's they're very very high intent
buyers and sellers right there all in
one spot all thanks to a company that
brings them all together on a parking
lot that would otherwise be unused do
you know how the purchase works are they
using like cashier checks or they just
like I don't even know transferring
Bitcoin it's completely up to the buyers
and sellers so Sierra autoair doesn't
even get involved there like hey we made
our 149 we're good we don't care what
happens they do like tracking to see if
the car is selling for their

[08:01]
the car is selling for their
testimonials and and advertising and all
that but what's Your Gut take on copying
this idea in another Market specifically
the cars or just the idea of utilizing
the parking lot space the whole business
I mean I really like it I think it's if
you can get people there yeah it's a
great business model my question would
be like are they paying rent to the
schools like how are they getting that
space what does that look like I would
assume they are I have no idea how much
what I don't like about this is that
it's like a three-sided Marketplace
almost you got buyers you've got sellers
and then you have a venue right the
venue would be the easiest it's one
point of contact but then you got to get
the buyers there and you got to get the
sellers there and a Marketplace is hard
enough when it's on a website but in
person man what if you have a hundred
cars there and five attendees what if
you have 500 attendees and 10 cars there
how do you balance that because if you

[09:00]
how do you balance that because if you
put out a Facebook ad and the ad blows
up for people to buy cars but your ad
for people to sell cars doesn't blow up
that's tough it's embarrassing it's
stressful very like the stress of an
in-person event vers like an online
event are incomparable so I don't like
that about it but I do like how
approachable it is and that it's a
proven model that you could replicate
somewhere else here's what I don't like
about the business I'll start there I
think there's a potential liability
right like do you have to get approval
from the city in order to host one of
these in order to conduct Commerce I I
just have no idea how would you work
with the school and then there's if
people are scammers like who do they
come after potential liability to you
for organizing the event Etc that's the
downside I think the upside is physical
Goods probably high ticket physical
Goods because you don't want to craft
fair you don't want to have people come
and selling a bunch of like cheap
trinkets but you want to have a space
for people to come bring there things

[10:00]
for people to come bring there things
that would typically want to be
inspected pre- purchase potentially
Furniture cars maybe Electronics like
I'm trying to think of some of the other
things so finding that in any Community
I think is really easy anybody could
find the high school the question is
like how do you how would you go out and
drum up interest and demand because like
you said it's a three-sided Marketplace
would you start with the supply would
you start with the demand first like
where would you start all right right if
you are watching this clip right now you
are watching this on YouTube and if you
are a fan of podcast please check out my
podcast while you're at it because
sometimes I have podcasts that aren't on
YouTube and sometimes I have YouTubes
that aren't on podcast so check out the
ker office on any podcast platform or
you can go to TKO pod.com also my
newsletter will'll throw that in there
there are no ads It's weekly it's
different content than my podcast and
YouTube newsletter. chrisj cerner.com
You'll see the link and we'll see you
there I would start small for sure and
try to get like 20 cars to pay and I
would plan it like two months out in

[11:00]
would plan it like two months out in
advance like it's like okay October 27th
we're going to have this carf Fair it's
usually $199 but it's $99 for our first
20 people I get 20 people and then I
shut it off and then it's like okay paid
these guys have already paid they're
going to be there now let's go find the
demand side and then just run I'd go
into all the Facebook groups and I would
just start posting like we do with our
home service businesses and just start
generating organic interest and I might
even charge like five dollars just so I
have some real intent to show up I'm
guessing for the Sierra one it probably
organically grew over time where each
year got bigger and it was word of mouth
right it was like pre- internet now I'm
trying to think you'd probably have to
spend a lot of money in order to get
awareness or do some like neighborhood
door knocking Flyers like those types of
things to get really creative but that
first year you're is probably an
investment or that first car show is
probably an investment probably not
making any money but it's one of those
long longtale Investments where you

[12:00]
long longtale Investments where you
spend a lot of money up front and then
it's just sort of self-fulfilling every
year after the first year you've got the
Facebook group and people are talking
about the next event and like you know
what I mean it's like I think there'd be
some builtin infrastructure after year
one but it probably take I don't know I
would guess you're probably spending a
couple thousand dollars just to do the
first one as a test you're not
necessarily profitable on the very first
one here's what I do you ready oh okay
I would go to Facebook Marketplace and
autotrader.com and just start messaging
all these people private party only that
are already selling cars I would say
it's a hundred bucks but you're going to
get a full refund after you show up
whether you sell your car or not I just
want to be sure that you show up so if
you never show up you're not going to
get a full refund but I need to make
sure that you're there so it's 100 bucks
it's 200 bucks you pay in advance now I
know you're going to be there I'm GNA
give you a full refund so they're
especially going to be there that way
you get the demand side okay you just
start messaging people that are already
selling cars not just cars Nick but cars

[13:00]
selling cars not just cars Nick but cars
that you know are likely to sell the
supply side you mean not the demand side
supply side yep yeah yeah yep and then
you can even go into Facebook groups of
people that are buying selling buying
and selling cars because that's a thing
and then you could start posting there
to get the demand side or you could just
use Facebook ads Facebook groups and all
that but I think if you can get 20 to 30
people to pay a 100 bucks to get their
car there it will actually be easier to
get the people to show up especially if
you can say hey we're going to have
Honda Civics there we're going to have
Ford F-150 there like you're not going
to allow the Subarus or the weird things
you want things that are going to sell
cuz the whole idea is not a car show
like it's not just for people to come
look at like you you want to buy and
sell cars there yep you know what else
could be interesting you know those high
school fundraisers where they sell like
the little books and within the book are
like coupons to Chipotle and the
local Ries or Supermarket
whatever like you could probably put a
coupon in there as well like maybe pay
for a spot in that book and then when

[14:01]
for a spot in that book and then when
all like just piggyback off of the high
school kids selling to all their friends
and family because essentially that's
what you want is the local community to
come and be active in buying and selling
these cars right yep that might even be
an interesting distribution
model yeah that might be an interesting
business period well here's another idea
I'm wondering if you reach out to the
people on Facebook Marketplace that are
selling something that is in demand a
Ford F-150 bestselling truck of all time
and you say hey I'm going to charge you
100 bucks but I'm going to give a full
refund and what I want you to do is
everyone that messages you about your
truck I want you to point them towards
our car fair and that way it's much more
efficient for you you don't have to meet
people up in the Walmart parking lot at
your house that becomes your
distribution Channel they start
funneling people to your car Fair that's
interesting so then you're contacting
people who they like it's already a
weird thing anyway to have somebody come
over to your house and inspect your car
you could scrape it and be like all
right anybody who's posted in the last
three days I'm going to message and I
know know that anybody within the last

[15:00]
know know that anybody within the last
three days I'm going to schedule out
seven days in advance a car show for
them and just see who's interested in
okay bring your car
here the potential problem with that is
if their car isn't running like how do
they tow it there I think they normally
would be that's an interesting way to do
it you're just scraping the new listings
and you're getting them to bring people
and you're pitching to them like hey
don't have people come to your house
well here's the pitch it's like hey you
have four interested parties for your
F-150 have them all come at 1:00 on
Saturday at the parking lot at the
community college all of them at one
then you got fomo now you have a 4:1
ratio of people interested in the car
and you got I'll take 21 Grand 22 Grand
235 right are you ready for this are you
ready my
boy all right
then who knows if this will work then
you go to three local auto body shops
and you say hey I want you to sponsor
this we'll put your name there give us a
mechanic just give us one me mechanic
for the hours between 10 and 1 okay what

[16:04]
for the hours between 10 and 1 okay what
why a mechanic give people the option to
pay for an inspection on that car so
they're just right there obviously you
can't do the full Suite because like you
need to actually jack up the car and get
under all that stuff but maybe it's
something quick where you can get a
better idea of what's wrong with the car
what issues might be associated with the
car because then the repair shop has
like leads right like well I just
diagnosed it but to get the rest I'd
really have to bring you into the shop
they're there it's easy the customer
pays for it it's like oh 50 bucks for a
quick inspection and so essentially
they're like paying 50 bucks for
leads does that make sense what I'm
saying yeah I kind of I'm hearing
something in your mic is that you eating
because it almost sounds like you want
to have your cake and eat it too Nick is
that you want to monetize from the
sellers and from a local business owner
is that good I don't know because H I

[17:00]
is that good I don't know because H I
was taught that you only want one stream
of Revenue but maybe that's not right
honestly I think you were just hearing
that because big dogs gotta
heat so I love it I love it like why
wouldn't you because then you then you
drisk a little bit the investment it's
like hey you sponsor this yes you're
getting people to pay to actually bring
their cars but you're also getting the
local auto body shops to to or mechanics
to sponsor it dude this is such a
perfect audience to buy and sell through
because it's the person selling is about
to have cash on their hands the person
buying already has cash on their hands
it's high ticket they're very like
anyone showing up is highly incentivized
to buy or sell it's just like the best
audience you could take this idea let's
say you did it for electronics and
you're very specific let's just say it's
I don't know an Apple electronics fair
and you only can bring iPads and
MacBooks and iPhones that are of a
certain certain generation and Beyond
like whatever you make it specific you

[18:02]
like whatever you make it specific you
could do the same thing you could have
Geek Squad there and sponsor it or like
the local you break ey fix there like
and they're just diagnosing these things
on the spot so you have again people
sponsoring it but then also people
paying to be a part of it you got your
cake and you're eating it I mean you
could have a local you could have a
local moving company you know these
people buying and selling are likely
either have just moved or about to move
they're in a change of life moment you
got have all kinds of people come and
sponsor it because the more stakeholders
from the community that you get to be a
part of it the higher likelihood that
they are going to post and get the word
out about it right y so of course you
want as many people there who are
invested in it success so it's not just
the sellers it's also the sponsors like
if there's a way for the buyers
obviously that'd be cool I mean the
mechanics could even do something where
yeah we'll look at these cars but also
if you come from the community you don't
have to come to sell your car you could
for a quick I'm sure some $50 service
you can do oil changes on the

[19:02]
you can do oil changes on the
spot that's interesting mobile oil
changes did we just a new business Tire
changes breake changes Johnny on the
spot the the best thing that you could
happen that could happen is if you had
50 cars for sale and like 500 people
show up and like by 1M like everything's
gone right that would be the best
scenario right then it's like oh instead
of doing this next month we're going to
do this again next week yeah I think
it'd have to be somebody who's like
really well connected in their local
market like that
knows that space like those local
businesses that can kind of work the
buyer and seller side that might have a
relationship and there may be somebody
who's like dude I could do this I know
the principal at the high school and I
know Jimmy dbob down at the mechanic
shop he' for sure come down and maybe
pay a couple pennies rub a couple
pennies together to fix some oil I'll
tell you what honestly it'd be smart if
a used car dealership did this and it's
bringing people to their dealership and
it's like oh why would you do that cuz

[20:00]
it's like oh why would you do that cuz
these people don't want to use car
dealership they might doesn't it's not
like this is going to put Ed car dealers
out of business they might go to look at
that Acura and they don't really like it
but the dealer has an Acura that they do
like it's like the dealer can just sit
by idly watching someone else profit off
of used cars or they can get involved
yeah like you said if it grows there are
a host of businesses that would be
interested in having access to that
community that you're bringing there
right like use car dealerships would be
one of them Banks would be one of them
not just because they're going to have
cash on hand to deposit but it's like oh
you need to finance this car like you
can Finance private party transactions
that's that's absolutely a thing so you
could have the Local Credit Union come
by and just be there in case anybody
wants to have a conversation there's a
million different businesses that could
be coming dude you could also just take
the registrations of the people that are
interested buyers they're not paying
anything you get their name email phone
number you could sell those leads five
times sell them to a bank sell them to a
autodetailing business sell them to a
car repair shop well dude okay take it a

[21:02]
car repair shop well dude okay take it a
step further you get their social
security number and their credit card
number dude you can sell that like eight
times on the black market you could
literally steal their
identity wow all right I like this idea
now here's my question to you it's like
a tangent on this idea are there not
mobile like oil change companies yes
they're growing like crazy right now are
they growing like crazy uhhuh yeah it's
like it's growing in popularity we need
to talk about that like I remember the
company when was it that you and I
talked about this was probably like
seven years ago where they would do
mobile gas that's growing like crazy too
it makes sense it totally makes sense
yeah so there's a business in Huntsville
Alabama that's very similar to this car
fair but it's just like this three acre
strip of land right off a highway where
there's no attendant and you just pay
$200 a month to park your car for sale
there with a for sale sign and everyone
just knows there's like a sign and they
just come in shop at their Leisure

[22:00]
just come in shop at their Leisure
there's no one there and you just call
the number and that's how they monetize
their land it's just raw land with a
gravel parking lot really pretty smart
right well because like every Community
Logistics really wherever you live
there's like that one street or that one
part of the street where people Park
their for sale cars M and they're not
paying anybody for that they're just
like parked on the street
yeah okay here's an idea yeah you ready
I'm in I'm chery Samberg right now I am
leaning in bro you are you are you're
going full Cheryl never go full Cheryl
so let's say you want to do this idea
you got to go buy land on some Highway
that's super expensive it probably works
really well for some Boomer that's owned
that land forever right and he's just
like monetizing it somewhat passively
what if you went to a a huge shopping
complex like a Walmart or a Hobby Lobby
that has a parking lot way bigger than
you need and you say hey kind of like a
a Dutch Brothers with lease land in the
middle of a parking lot you're going to

[23:00]
middle of a parking lot you're going to
lease 20 parking spots on the edge of
the parking lot that's least desirable
to the shopping center because it's far
away from the shop but it's most
desirable to you because it's closer to
the road and you can literally just play
middleman you you lease the there 20
parking spots for 500 a month and you
could have people come Park their cars
for sale in that spot you could put some
signage up I like that idea less
because I I don't know I just I would
worry about the liability of K carard
gets broken into and stolen you're not
pulling the actually card on me right
act no I'm not pulling the actually card
on you what I'm saying is if you went
and did it at a supermarket or a
Walmart for me it's like okay well then
we could set up cameras to make people
feel safer and then we could like
expands the scope of the services it's
simple on on paper but in actuality it's
l yeah yeah that's that's what I mean
like I still think it's a great I think
it's a really cool idea just that one
would make me more nervous because at

[24:02]
would make me more nervous because at
least with the fair it's like this is a
designated time we're going to be here
between 10: and 2 Cool done you're out
where you start like Su if and if you
own the land cool great I'm generating
revenue from this and I actually own the
land but then you start like suing the
spaces from Walmart I don't know makes
nervous I think to to your point the
liability let's say you could easily go
by Insurance okay you solve that problem
you really don't solve that problem
because the massive property developer
that owns that land is probably just too
scared of the liability to care that you
can just go buy it they don't want it
but if assuming you could overcome that
I see this as a good way to get your
feet wet in the bigger idea right to
prove the demand prove the model maybe a
month-to Monon Le because it's like
listen Dutch Brothers is gonna they're
going to break up your concrete they're
going to put in plumbing and electrical
and all that if you don't like this
We're Gone in 30 days we're just testing
something here yeah I like it so all
right I got an idea for you let's hear
it okay you know who Nikita beer

[25:02]
it okay you know who Nikita beer
is all right so I'm going to do a really
bad job you'll probably correct me but
this is like the background Nikita beer
has grown a couple of companies in a
viral Manner and made a ton of money so
his first company was called I think it
was called
TBH essentially it was an anonymous
compliment app that high school students
could compliment other high school
students and then if you downloaded the
app you'd get a notification that's like
you have I don't know number of
anonymous comments about you but you've
got to pay in order to see them so the
compliments were behind a pay wall and
high school kids are obviously really
curious they're like what did someone
say I was cute did someone say I was
nice did someone say I was funny
athletic whatever and he was very
strategic in this he went to three high
schools I think it was in Alabama
Georgia was it Georgia okay so he goes
to three high schools in Georgia he
throws up an Instagram page he starts
friend requesting on Instagram every
student there but it was a private
Instagram page so it got them to accept
and buy and all it said was like

[26:01]
and buy and all it said was like
launching on this date there was like a
tagline and a launching by this date so
it built up all this excitement and so
when they launched they already had a
bunch of people who were following them
on Instagram it was very targeted at
these schools and it caught on like
wildfire right like these three high
schools it catches on and he decides to
grow it and it grows like crazy he ends
up selling it to Facebook for $100
million in
2017 and and he has a non-compete
Facebook they've got more money than
they know what to do with they end up
not actually taking advantage of this
app or this idea and so five years later
his non-compete or whatever he had
signed with Facebook lapses and in 2022
he has an idea for new app except it's
the same app it's like literally the
same idea the same Playbook everything
and he launches it in October of 2022
check this out launches it October 2022
October 11 becomes the number one app in
the app store October 21st he's got a

[27:02]
the app store October 21st he's got a
million active daily paying users
October 23rd they hit 1 million in sales
December 1st they hit five million in
sales and in January January 17th he
sells the Discord for an undisclosed
amount probably eight to nine figures so
like in four months basically he
launches and sells this like $90 million
company he's a rain maker he's a rain
maker but the playbooks the same he's
exploiting these
viral hyper poopular products and it's
nothing new like in the 80s we had the
pet rock like like and it got viral and
all the kids liked it like it was the
same idea right there was a social
pressure of like oh well so and so has a
pet rock I want a pet rock and in the
90s we had tamagachi like little animals
that we would take care of on these
little computers that freaking weird and
you know in the 2000s I don't even know
Pokemon it's nothing new he just went
and it it was now applied to the app
generation so all of that it first of

[28:01]
generation so all of that it first of
all any did I miss anything with the
story no no you're good okay cool all
right so the it just got me thinking
that this like novelty product scaling
hyper fast and then
selling is the same it's just different
iterations of technology that are being
used and the last generation was apps
and I think the next generation is going
to be chat GPT or artificial
intelligence so I don't have like the
idea but I wanted to brainstorm on this
with you because over the last few weeks
I've been having this thought of how
funny it would be to build an AI chat
bot called Chad
GPT who who just like roasts people like
it would just be and he talks about like
the carnivore diet and listening to Joe
Rogan and I'm sure Chad GPT exists
because it's just too good of a name to
not exist to me
that would be something that kind of
fits the Nikita beer framework of like

[29:03]
fits the Nikita beer framework of like
that could go hyperv viral shared really
quickly with a bunch of high school
students it probably doesn't take a ton
of time energy or effort to build the
infrastructure for it for kids to play
around with it but it's something that
could catch fire really really quickly
so potentially a chatbot that's trained
on a proprietary like hold C Bros right
like we we create our own chatbot and we
sell for a dollar a month or something
like that but I'm curious to get your
thoughts I have many thoughts okay okay
first of all love it second of all about
a year ago there was this Heyday for
apps and Chrome extensions these little
SAS tools that leveraged open ai's API
and it basically allowed college
students to quote get help on their
assignments AKA cheat on their test okay
and the marketing for these was
brilliant because picture this picture a
Tik Tok video of someone sitting in
class class it's like a stadium style
seating and it's like a grainy video

[30:02]
seating and it's like a grainy video
sitting in class and the text on the
screen says like oh my gosh what is my
classmate doing and it zooms in on their
classmates's laptop which is sitting in
front of them and it shows them taking a
test or a quiz with a Chrome extension
like automatically inputting all the
answers oh my God those went and so it
it looked like it was an organic natural
video but absolutely not the people
posting these were people behind the
company and there were like three or
four clones of this and like I swear
they all went to like 100k Mr or more
immediately because it spread so easily
and so virally so I love the
distribution aspect of that of it
because there's a lot of precedent I
think the tool itself needs to be
something that offers more value than
like something that's funny although it
could go viral because it's hard to pay
for things that are funny and it's hard
for something funny or clever to have
real lasting staying power right so I
think the idea should be tweaked like
the way Nikita did it was essentially
putting the pay wall in between you and

[31:02]
putting the pay wall in between you and
finding out what people thought about
you which makes sense but the the funny
aspect isn't necessarily creating the
same type of fomo yeah so let me tell
you about an idea that is similar to
Nikita's idea but it's low Tech that you
don't have to have any coding or app
development skills to do so I'm gonna
give a shout out to my friend Sam
Aldridge he emailed me eight months ago
cold University of Georgia student Roll
Tide and it was a very well-written
email and he just told me last week that
it took him like hours to write this
email and he kept rewriting it rewriting
it and it was like put down your P
energy drink and listen and read this
email that was like the subject and I
read it and I ended up tweeting a
screenshot of it and it did really well
and people were like you need to hire
this gift I've talked about Sam he's
helped on a number of different projects
anyway his not his first Hustle but the
hustle that he was doing at the time
January 2024 I'm going to read his email
I pulled it up so he says during the
summer before College I stumbled upon
this Instagram account ug class of

[32:02]
this Instagram account ug class of
2025 enter college class Instagram
accounts college class Instagram
accounts connect Rising freshmen to
their peers so they can meet each other
and most importantly find roommates
without these Pages there's no way to
find out who is attending your college
until the first day of class so this
reminds me of the not.com idea that we
had or just point that we made of where
wedding planning is happening on
Instagram and not on the not.com anymore
so roommate finding is happening on
Instagram now so he says the email
proceeds so everyone who's going to a
certain College will follow that page in
a heartbeat for every single College
there is a class of page I estimate
there are hundreds of them back to the
story so I followed this page and
submitted all my info to be posted
through the pages DM so it's like all
right you're gonna go to the University
of Georgia you don't know anyone you DM
the page and you say hey will you post
my picture a so I can feel gratified
that someone's talking about me on
Instagram and B so I can find a roommate
and so he says I get a response and they
tell me sure just Veno them $4 and he

[33:02]
tell me sure just Veno them $4 and he
says mind- blown I remember thinking
this page is making a killing anywhere
between 1,000 to 2,000 students are
posted in an admission cycle that's 4
to8 grand just for posting on Instagram
and barely any work and you could
automate all this the Georgia page has
made about 30 to 50 Grand since
Inception I estimate there's they have
over 5,000 posts with an aov per student
poster of $10 $500,000 to a million doll
market cap for all the pages I'm
assuming so anyway he started doing this
he copied this idea of btim at Purdue
just because he didn't see that they
already had one and he started making a
ton of money I'm not gonna read the
whole email but that's the gist of it
yeah and so he says I charged $4 for the
half of the first year and increased it
to 8 by the end of the first year now I
charge $12 and there's no price
resistance just like one time one time
yeah okay and there's barely any price
resistance so long story short he was
doing that and it went really well until
this company called meety yourclass came
along meetyou class.com that basically

[34:03]
along meetyou class.com that basically
operationalized this made this
sophisticated and they got VC funded and
now they have like over 400,000 students
and it's like a roommate finder app that
they launched with this exact same
strategy oh my gosh and that's what
would happen right like you launch this
you start making a bunch of money and
then people see it and copy you and then
VC's fund it and that's fine but like
there are these windows in time where
you can make $100,000 in two months yep
and that's an example not necessarily
using AI but just like hopping on a
trend really quickly and monetizing it
and that's what Nikita beer did to grow
so fast is he took the three high
schools I think he started with one and
then three and he Geo fenced the app to
where you would only see the app in the
app store if you lived within five
minutes of valdasta Georgia or something
random and so it was very exclusive to
that high school and I think he might
have even named the app after the high
school so it was like wow this is an app

[35:00]
school so it was like wow this is an app
just for us it's just
genius do you think there's an
opportunity to do that do something
similar in high schools and colleges
like is there something unique in the
targeting of that demographic in that
manner or is it lightning in a bottle I
think it's a bit of both I think you
could Niche down with like a major or
like which college you're in like
business school you know whatever or I
think you could do it with bigger high
schools around the country you just take
a list of all the high schools in the
country sort by enrollment and try it
with that basically the same Instagram
strategy because I don't think VC is
ever really going to care about that
probably too small of an opportunity
right but I love stories like these dude
that's rad I've never seen you post
about that yeah I need to you do it's a
good story okay what' you think part two
of this episode will be next week where
we'll talk about a trampoline idea a
mattress idea a viral video business
idea a viral store idea and how to
invest in creators so enjoy
