do you ever wonder what happens to all
those large items that people return to
companies like Costco that never get
sold like Furniture me too guess what
this is day 8 of 10 of showing you how
to make money on websites like this that
you've never heard of this website sells
truckloads of returned Furniture
electronics and other large items for
99% off because they're auctions and
there are not as many biders as there
should be my friend Shannon tweeted this
picture right here and it is a picture
of a $20,000 truckload worth of
furniture that got sold for $250 but
here's the catch you need to be in Okala
Florida so set filters for your local
area and bid on these truckloads you can
literally get them for 99% off and sell
them on Facebook Marketplace or anywhere
the website in question is beck.com
Cosco
