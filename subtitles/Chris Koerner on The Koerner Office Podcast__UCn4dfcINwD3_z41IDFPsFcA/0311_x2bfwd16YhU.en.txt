I have a serious illness I cannot walk
into a business without thinking how
much does this place make if these guys
had X customers every hour how much
money do they make so a lot of times I
go to a business and I ask the owner
straight up how much money are you
making so I'm driving through the middle
of nowhere in Missouri and I see this
pizza truck a lot of people have dreams
to open a restaurant but they don't have
$500,000 well something like this will
set you back about $225,000 and I ask
him how many pizzas are you selling
every day4 to 50 at $20 a pop that's
$11,000 a day in Pizza you don't need a
half million dollar to open a restaurant
what's the most genius about this
strategy is that he's parked right
outside a dispensary people get the
munchies they come here they see this
and he has huge repeat business so shout
out to this place Rock Enzo if you're
outside of Kansas City the pizza was
absolutely delicious you're not paying
me to make this I just love small
business and I want to support it
