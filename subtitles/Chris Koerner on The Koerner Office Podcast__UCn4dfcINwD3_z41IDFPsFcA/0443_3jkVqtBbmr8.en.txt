all right look at this freaking thing
right here got a ball python and I just
invented the most genius thing ever so
normally when we feed this bad boy we've
got to dangle a warm Mouse over it for
like 15 minutes and it gets really
annoying so we set up this contraption
here check it out got a paperclip string
close Pin you hang the dead mouse from a
Clos pin then you put a space heater in
here cuz it'll keep it warm and it will
keep it moving and you just hang it
right above his head and the mouse will
just keep going back and forth with the
space heater but staying warm and he
attacked it boom isn't that beautiful if
you want something to get don't ask a
lazy person
