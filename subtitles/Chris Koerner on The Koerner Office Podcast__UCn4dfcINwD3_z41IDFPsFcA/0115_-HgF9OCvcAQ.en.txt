[00:01]
works
all right welcome to the ker office I
want to do a little different episode
today I have had many of you submit your
business ideas to me over the last month
or two I've got about 30 of them I'm gon
to cover some of them and I want to
roast them and when I say roast I mean
that pretty liberally because I'm not
really a mean guy

[01:00]
really a mean guy
uh and I like most business ideas
because I think almost any idea could
work I think the bigger question is
should you launch something not would it
work or not um so roast might not be the
most accurate word uh but rather grade
them I'm going to grade them and I'm
gonna vote them a stud or a dud uh your
idea uh now I'm working with very
limited info here because I I have like
between three words and three sentences
from all of these and so a lot of times
you get the best feedback an info from
ideas when you just ask them 20
questions and I don't have that luxury
right now so I'm also going to be live
streaming this to YouTube and maybe
someone will hop in and ask a question
maybe not if not that's fine I've got
plenty of presubmit
stuff but um we're gonna see how this
goes and maybe it'll give you an idea to
launch something of your own maybe you
can copy one of these
shamelessly and there's nothing wrong
with that so let's just get into it

[02:00]
[Music]
I have two types of ideas I have college
student submitted ideas and then I have
any type of person submitted ideas so I
will clarify before the idea so you know
what type of person it's from
all right first idea is from a college
student named Anthony he says I want to
start a nonprofit called Project Earth
where where we would develop robots that
clean our planet probably will never get
to see it happen because of the
unbelievable amount of funding it will
take though Anthony I love your idea um
I love your optimism and your
willingness to start a nonprofit um but
I suggest that you start with something

[03:00]
I suggest that you start with something
easier even if it is a nonprofit um
start with a nonprofit that encourages
college students to clean up around
campus right start there get some
traction um and then Branch out maybe to
other campuses maybe to non-college
students and start to make a name for
yourself online on on social media that
this is your thing that you're trying to
clean up our planet um and then at that
point it will be significantly easier to
raise funding if you want to use robots
to do it and hey maybe you can get a
partnership with figure
or with Tesla or with any of the three
or four companies that are trying to
build these robots right now um maybe
they can give you a couple for free
because it's a nonprofit so love the
idea but I don't think you should start
with robots I think you should start
very simply and go from there

[04:00]
okay next idea from another another
college student I want to start a
marketing agency for cash payon
psychiatrist okay I love how niched this
is already so I'm already liking this
idea I have a direct in to a network of
psychiatrists who share a pain point of
not being able to book appointments for
a certain audience competitive Advantage
is being able to work directly with a
top psychiatrist in my area which allows
me to get clients and spinoff more
services off the back of my CL client
base all right I'm just reading through
this again to get a good feel for the
question okay so you've got an in which
I love um it's very Niche which I love
and it seems that there is a demand for

[05:00]
and it seems that there is a demand for
this um which I love so I don't see a
problem with this you don't have an in
with one psychiatrist you have an in
with an an in with a network of
psychiatrists that seems to say that
this is a common problem so yes I love
this idea this is a stud um and I think
you should do it so we've got a guy in
the lobby let's let him
in hey what's going
on hello hey how are you I'm doing well
how are you good I I'd love to hear your
idea yeah thank you for letting me in
your your camera's sideways by the
way
Perfect all right now did you come from
the YouTube live
link yes okay awesome yeah let's hear
your idea thank you thank you for your
time and thank you for letting me in so

[06:02]
time and thank you for letting me in so
I'm from India I've been here for last
13 years so back in India we have uh we
do have shop like a retail retail outlit
right where this sell freshly made chips
they make I know chips is a billion
dollar month I'm talking about I'm
talking
about you're kind of you're kind of
break breaking up there I'm missing a
few words yeah uh is it is it good now
that's better did you say chips is a
billion dollar market yeah yeah yeah
yeah I'm talking about potato chips okay
chips I'm talk not talking about AI
chips for now yeah gotcha okay yeah so
they are freshly made and given to you
and they are
flavored with whatever flavor you would
like so in United States we we buy a lot
of chips I mean we buy a lot of chips

[07:01]
of chips I mean we buy a lot of chips
right but those are made long back like
outdated I mean at least a week two or
month ago or couple of months ago right
and we buy to we we go to your store and
buy it from them either it's HB Whole
Foods whatever in Texas I'm in Texas
too right so I was thinking of a me me
and my wife was thinking of an idea
where why don't we set up small shops
where we where we make chips from
scratch right so you you as a consumer
customer come into the store hey I want
this potato chips with buffalo ranch
right whatever flavor so we make it in 5
10 minutes and give it to you so you
enjoy hard served chips
right you go from there so um let me
just make sure I have this straight so
you basically have the potatoes maybe

[08:00]
you basically have the potatoes maybe
sliced prepped maybe sitting in water
ready to fry someone walks up and says
hey I want the ranch chips you say all
right give me five minutes and it's it's
kind of a fast casual concept solely
focus on potato chips um that's it right
yeah potato chips and it could be any
other but we could start with potato
chips right and uh maintain high quality
in terms of ingredients having so lot of
people go to F guys because they use uh
they use peanut oil along with uh I mean
peanut oil along with the french fries
to give them a better quality right so I
just want to copy whatever is working uh
and wherever you go when you buy chips
it has lot of ingredients which are not
needed in chips right would would this
be more of a place where you eat the
chips on site or you bag them up and
they take them with
them uh bag them up and take them okay
have you looked into like the popcorn

[09:00]
have you looked into like the popcorn
shops that do this I know there's one in
mckin called Mom and popcorn have you
have you looked into them at all no I
would look into that because it's
basically what they do except they don't
they won't make it on the spot for you
they just sell all kinds of different
unique popcorn flavors like buffalo
ranch and pizza and it's actually really
good pickle flavored um but it's also a
candy store so the popcorn is just one
element of it and I don't know what the
percentage of sales the popcorn
represents but it's it's primarily a a
sweet store in Like a downtown walkable
area that also sells popcorn that
reminds me of this what what I like
about the idea is that it's high margin
no one's really feeling this need uh
what I don't like about it is that it's
it's new and it's scary to me to invent
a new food concept so I think you should
try it you should test this idea it
would cost very very little at a farmers
market just get a fryer and pay a
hundred bucks and see what people think
what is their feedback is it that much

[10:00]
what is their feedback is it that much
more remarkable to have a freshh chip
from the fryer um that hasn't doesn't
have preservatives and all that or is it
just like yeah this is a really good
chip but I wouldn't come back because at
the end of the day you're going to need
people to come back and to like get
addicted to a very specific flavor that
you offer because if you're just having
to sell to new customers all the time
with A New Concept it doesn't work right
like crumble was kind of a New Concept
um and it worked because people were
coming back you know and the margins
were really high and I feel like the
margins would be really high for what
you're doing too it just makes me
nervous that it's it's a new food
concept um I just don't like being first
God so the way to try it out is Farmers
Market that's what I thought as well uh
I mean get you get a old used fryer and
try it in farmers market and see the
feedback and what people say yeah yeah I
think so another thing that makes me
nervous is do people like do are they
really passionate about chips because it

[11:01]
really passionate about chips because it
feels to me like in the chips versus
french fry argument french fries win and
you should also look into there's a
concept out of Utah that does like
french fry only french fries only like
loaded fries fry nachos and they might
do soda like dirty sodas as well um I
would look into that and kind of see
what their business model is you might
be able to copy some aspects of what
they're doing but that that also makes
nervous um let's see
I think it's called Fizz in fries f r YZ
there's one location in Logan where I
actually grew up YZ I don't know if they
have here's their
website looks like they're
franchising
[Music]
um so yeah I would be wary of copying
these guys because it looks like they've
only had one location for years because

[12:01]
only had one location for years because
they have been in Logan for years and
they have a franchise tab up but it
looks like it's just like collecting
interest for people that might want to
franchise I don't think they're actually
doing it
okay the name is fizz fizz and then the
letter N Fries f r YZ f r YZ okay got it
but I think just because of the fact
that you have this idea and you like
this idea you've got to get it out of
your head by testing it youve got to
you've got to cross that bridge to see
if it's viable or not or else you're
always just going to wonder yeah I know
so anyway let me know how it goes thank
you so problem I have another if you
have time yeah let's hear it El okay so
this is a technology idea where uh uh
you I've been following you for a long
time uh from Twitter uh newsletter and
here right you you work a lot on hedback

[13:01]
here right you you work a lot on hedback
construction uh I mean uh those kind of
sector too right so I I I was seeing a
lot of people when it comes to Plumbing
or
hedback uh so the prices are not fixed
right uh people can I mean every company
has a different pricing structure and
people can people can give you any sort
of price right so I thought of building
so I I am a software man software
engineering manager manager right and I
have built products end to end right so
I thought of building uh uh uh biding
platform where uh as a customer I put in
my problem statement when I say problem
statement or my need my requirement
right and they could just they could
just type in few things and AI would
autoc correct everything with a picture
if needed and uh it it's a Marketplace a
two-sided Market place where consumer uh

[14:01]
two-sided Market place where consumer uh
puts in their need requirement and we
have bunch of HVAC companies sitting on
the other side right which would take in
the request and whoevers there could be
multiple people submitting the code
right and uh multiple people submitting
the code and our platform will make it
easy for the user showing the cheapest
bid and going through their website
scraping all the reviews and uh reviews
and the information that they have and
providing uh necessary information for a
customer to make an informed decision
are these the right people to do it
based on information that we see uh uh
based on information that we see online
right and uh based on their bid right
and based on their uh presence
outside so are you familiar with
Thumbtack yeah but the don't do real
time right what do you mean real time so

[15:03]
time right what do you mean real time so
the these are all real time you you
submit in your requirement and based on
uh uh based on what uh the other person
I mean the hitback company what the H
company feels about they submit you a
quote real
time well thumb teac is is is pretty
real time because the contractors are so
eager to get the work because they pay
thumb Tac so much to be on there that I
use thumb Tech as a consumer on a
regular basis and I'll have quotes
within a half hour so it's pretty real
time I think this this idea is pretty
audacious um thump Tech had to raise
nine figures to do this and they're
doing it really well I like the idea I
think it's good but I think it's it it'd
be really hard to test like on a small
scale um and then once you do once your
test results look good you have to
compete against thumb teac and I don't
like that about it what I do like is and
this is where I thought you were going

[16:00]
this is where I thought you were going
with this is building a piece of
software that you sell to HVAC companies
that enables them to kind of like offer
a a menu of services to customers and so
like let's say I type in Plano Texas
HVAC and I get 10 results and on nine of
them I click and it's like call us for a
quote call us for a quote call us for a
quote and on the other one that I I
click it's just like hey answer two
questions and we'll give you a quote
right now so I like the idea of selling
you know $200 a month software to HVAC
companies that enable them to easily
give quotes to customers with like a a
big as risk of hey when we get there if
we find out that it's not really as
advertised this quote is subject to
change but assuming that everything is
accurate um yeah it's going to be 250
bucks to replace whatever you think
needs replacing I like that idea um
because I don't think anyone's doing
that
um and it gives HVAC companies a leg up

[17:02]
um and it gives HVAC companies a leg up
on their competitors or or any pick pick
any home service right it gives them a
leg
out but how would it be different than
thumb Tech as you said because thumb
this isn't a Marketplace you're just
selling a an app a widget that Home
Service businesses can build into their
existing platform they don't have to
build their company around it um it
could just be like a a suffix on their
URL right like it's a new a quote form
basically where instead of like
submitting your name and number and
address and then having someone call you
you submit your name and your number and
what's going on and then it gives you a
price right away because some customers
are like I don't want to talk to you I
don't want to wait for your guy to show
up two hours late I just I just want a
price if someone can give me a price I'm
probably not going to shop around and
find something $50 cheaper I'm probably
just going to go with you yeah nobody
has time nowadays exactly I I I don't
want to have five people come to my
house to give a price I'd rather pay a

[18:00]
house to give a price I'd rather pay a
little more to just get a price and have
someone come do it um so I do like that
idea um starting with one industry just
going all in on that industry and then
branching out to other
Industries go thank you uh of course I
have a question this is unrelated but uh
how do I invest with you on real
estate um you could shoot me an email
Chris co-founders
docomo co-founders
just one word co-founders yep yeah okay
thank you yeah thank you and thanks for
coming on man take care thank you yeah
you too
bye all right thank you um Abby Shake I
hope I didn't say your name wrong thank
you for coming in he came from the
YouTube live link which is awesome um
there's a few more people watching on
YouTube thank you Kaylin night I
appreciate that very very kind of you um

[19:00]
appreciate that very very kind of you um
if anyone watching on YouTube has any
business ideas or any business questions
this is kind of an ideas podcast but any
questions hop in on the link that I
posted and come ask it meanwhile I'm
going to read some more presubmit
questions so this next one is from Luke
Luke says I do web development I Target
small to medium businesses looking for a
professional easy to manage website I
also can do custom JavaScript features
um that's all he told me uh I assume
that your idea is build websites for
small to mediumsized businesses I think
it's a great business I think it was a
good business in 1998 I think it's going
to be a great business in 2038 uh it's
kind of funny how no
matter how many companies come out
Squarespace Wix
Weebly card uh WordPress web flow it
doesn't matter there will always be a
market for an individual or a business
owner to say hey just make this website
for me always right it doesn't matter

[20:00]
for me always right it doesn't matter
how many tools there are there's a dozen
different AI tools that can build a
website from a prompt people are still
going to want people to do it for them
so if that's your idea Luke um I think
it's a good idea so that's three college
student ideas let's hop over to um the
non-oled student ideas this is from KY
he says been mulling over starting a
hydroa Biz essential oils think rosemary
oil eucalyptus Etc I found a vendor in
China
that makes distilling units for half the
price as USA made only problem is I
don't have land to grow said plants but
can Outsource that from around the city
and I don't know if there is really a
market to compete against the big
players in the game that Source globally
with cheap labor Ki I don't really like
this idea um I'll tell you why you're
already thinking along the lines of I
want to get something from China okay if
you've already flipped that switch in
your brain you're like halfway there so

[21:00]
your brain you're like halfway there so
now the question you need to ask
yourself is what is the most
advantageous thing I can import from
China to sell in the US and in my
opinion and I've done this a lot the
higher ticket the better period end of
story find an item that is small and
expensive okay for instance we sell
Bitcoin miners we import them from China
they're not really small there's about
as big as like a desktop Tower and they
weigh 33 lbs but even so
we don't need to ship them in a
container right I say small because I
want you to ship them via DHL air that
makes all the difference in the world
you can have it from Hong Kong or
shenzen or guano to your door within
three
days and the higher the ticket the
better because it means you can H use
paid ads to sell it you don't have to
sell as many of course there's always a
trade-off higher tet ticket equals lower
volume but I like that tradeoff I would
much rather sell a $1,000 item to10
people than a $100 item to 100 people um

[22:02]
people than a $100 item to 100 people um
any day of the week so I don't like the
essential oils idea in a sense it is
high ticket based on the size but you're
already looking at China um I don't like
the idea that you have to grow something
you need land um I don't know anything
about that market I will admit um I know
it is kind of slimy there is some there
are some bad actors in This base which I
don't like that idea about it as well um
I assume that something triggered you to
give you this idea I just I don't like
the idea of it being essential oils um
or something that you would have to grow
and I don't understand why you would
have to grow something if you were going
to import this from China if you really
want to do it then import it from China
to kind of test the model and see
because maybe you find that there's a
ton of pent up demand for a very
specific type of oil that's just going
gang busters if so great imported from
China to prove the model um and then go
down the road of actually growing it and
processing it yourself to boost your
margins if the numbers make sense um

[23:02]
margins if the numbers make sense um
hello to everyone on
YouTube you got a handful
here looks like we got a question in the
comments my company helps other
companies sell their refurbished
products on e-commerce stores like
Amazon eBay Walmart Etc okay let me
justy I got ADHD now I'm gonna have to
read that again because it went one ear
out the other my company helps other
companies sell their refurbished
products okay on e-commerce stores okay
okay where would I start to capture
traffic to send them to specific
listings the problem with e-commerce
places are their rules around buy box
that change constantly so I want to go
after getting and owning traffic to be
able to send them to specific listings
dynamically interesting
okay so you're using these big
marketplaces to help other companies

[24:00]
marketplaces to help other companies
sell their products that happen to be
refurbished you want to drive more
traffic to those products you can do a
good job for your customers but you
don't know how to drive traffic to
specific listings like a specific Amazon
product
right um why I mean why can't you just
use paid Amazon ads have you tried that
um or paid Walmart ads I don't know of a
way outside of that um that works very
well
I'm pretty sure that you can even use
paid Amazon ads to boost your listing
listing on Google shopping results as
well
um yeah but maybe there's something I'm
not understanding about
that all right um if you're on YouTube
watching this would love to have you
click the link that I posted at the very
top of the comments and hop in here here
and ask me or you can comment it below
let's go to our next pre-submitted
questions right now if you're just
joining us we are roasting business

[25:01]
joining us we are roasting business
ideas and I use that term loosely I'm
grading them is it a stud or a dud um
John asks if he should sell 20 to $50
PDFs of nicely formatted market research
for local service businesses so I need a
little more context what type of market
research is it a restaurant
research the fact that it's $ 20 to $50
I don't like it's really really hard to
sell something at that price point and
it's hard to sell things to local
service businesses they are hard to sell
to notoriously most of them don't have
employees that means when they get a
call they're expecting SL hoping it to
be a customer and if it's a salesperson
they tune out immediately and they get
calls from a lot of sales people ask me
how I know um all else equal I'm only
going on about 12 words here I don't
like that idea I think it needs to be
300 $50 instead of 20 to 50 and it's

[26:02]
300 $50 instead of 20 to 50 and it's
going to be I think it's going to be
hard to find customers I think you need
to go up Market to more medium-sized
businesses and sell a multi thousand
market research product to them um
something that could make them more
money somehow uh next question Chad
Kroger all right lease he wants to lease
a tiny 100 square foot commercial space
with Street Frontage in a dense City
like New York customers pay $10 to spin
a wheel think Wheel of Fortune there's
two possible outcomes a shot of whiskey
and pickle juice or a collectible Chad
Kroger stickle sticker welcome to
pickleback or Nickelback all right um
Chad okay I hate the idea of renting a a
commercial space in New York for this
because man you've got to sell a lot of
$10 tickets to pay the rent on that but
I do like the idea of just being like a
street vendor to test this concept

[27:00]
street vendor to test this concept
because I think this um spin the wheel
concept just plays on our human emotion
of wanting to win prizes wanting to play
the lottery wanting to get rich quick
all right I love the visual aspect of it
especially if it were like super lit up
and bright and colorful and big like
like outrageously big I tweeted about
this when I went to New York with my
family a year ago um I'll try to put in
the show notes where we were in New York
just outside of Time Square
and there were these immigrants um with
a platform that had like a rotating arm
that you put your phone in and it plays
that song on repeat Welcome to New York
right and you pay 20 bucks and you stand
on this platform and it just spins
around you and takes a video and
pictures yada y yada and I did a tweet
about it and got over a million views
because these guys are just cleaning up
this platform cost two grand on Amazon I
don't think they have to pay rent to be
there on the street I think they just
have to get a license they probably have

[28:00]
have to get a license they probably have
to pay like a one-time fee I'm totally
guessing I could be wrong but I don't
think these guys are paying like a th000
bucks a month just to stand on the
street because it wasn't like a food
truck or a cart or anything they're just
on the street um I like the idea of you
doing that exact same thing with this
idea um just to see how it goes prove
the concept I love the idea of testing
Concepts in high-f foot traffic areas
like this because you can get feedback
face-to-face super valuable super
relevant feedback immediately from
people that usually have money um
they're in New York and they're either
traveling there which means they have
money or they live there which means at
least they have enough money to live
there because it's very expensive so
thank you uh Mr Kroger for that
idea I've got another question here on
YouTube quiner 48 is it possible to
build a $1 million Revenue business in a
year absolutely it's possible it happens
all the time it happens every
um the quickest I built a 1 million

[29:01]
um the quickest I built a 1 million
Revenue business was a matter of two
weeks and that's not an exaggeration I'm
not this isn't one of those Instagram
videos where I'm like flexing in front
of someone else's Lamborghini I actually
did I sold Bitcoin miners they were
$20,000 Bitcoin Miners and it was right
place right time I found product Market
fit I found a good supplier it was the
culmination of seven different
businesses that I had started in the
past which that is an argument for
starting a bunch of businesses and not
just doing one thing is you're able to
cross reference all these learnings and
so when you think about it a million
dollars in revenue is 50 $20,000 miners
50 miners that's it I sold 50 products
over the course of a couple weeks our
second month we did $4.3
million in the month of November 2021 in
one month our second month we launched
October 1st and that was like 12% profit
no funding we all bootstrap so not we're
not just talking Topline this was

[30:00]
not just talking Topline this was
profitable it's great business and I
still own that business um so yes it's
very very possible but you have to pick
a business with higher ticket size right
I'm gonna say that until the day I die
um maybe it's a pool company you sell
$100,000 pools you just need 10 okay can
you do that um maybe it's
a um let's
say a driveway replacement company and
your average ticket size is $10,000 you
need to sell 100 driveways okay so you
find the older neighborhoods that have
cracked up driveways and you start
knocking on doors or you pay people to
knock on doors and give them a thousand
commission um there's a zillion ways to
make a million dollar Revenue business
in a year the hard part is actually
finding a way to make a profit out of
that because when you see people online
talking about how much they made quote
that's like the worst business word in
the English language oh I made $4
million last year they almost always
mean Topline you could have lost a
million out of that four so the hard

[31:02]
million out of that four so the hard
part is getting it to be profitable
because there are many a Silicon Valley
companies that raised many millions of
dollars that took a decade or more to be
profitable or raised nine figures and
never became profitable and went out of
business so optimize for profit and not
Revenue all right YouTube's picking up
come on we got any more questions from
YouTube I would much prefer live
questions than
PR submitted ones but let's go to the
next one this is from
Bayou Bayou wants to buy two leaf
blowers and a ladder hire two people
pick a neighborhood and go door too
offering to clean the pine straw off of
their roof right then plus $25 to bag
and leave on their curb okay do I like
this idea no I love this idea it's a
perfect idea right place right time you
want to find neighborhoods that have the
types of trees that are putting pine
straw or leaves on the roof um you're
right there most people don't want to

[32:01]
right there most people don't want to
get on the roof um I actually just
cleaned my gutters myself i' been in my
house for eight years I'd never done it
I'd never had it done um and if someone
would have just showed up at my door I
for sure would have paid him a couple
hundred bucks to do it um I don't like
the idea of you paying people to do it
for you right off the bat I want you to
do it yourself right off the bat so you
can know all the little nuances what
does Betty say when you tell her the
price right what is your objection like
what are your counters to all of the
objections I want you to do it yourself
sell a hundred doors make a little
manual and then start hiring people to
do it or else you're never going to know
what the most optimal way is to sell
those Services if someone that doesn't
really care about your business starts
it from day one so you want to test this
you got to test it yourself I do the
same thing to this day and I always will
and that testing phase is the funnest
part okay

[33:08]
someone on YouTube asked how true do you
find the saying build the plane when you
are flying that's a th% true there's
there's no lie in that statement that's
what I do today it's what I did when I
was 12 years old here's another question
Anthony if you started from zero with
extremely limited resources what type of
business would you start not afraid to
cold call um I would love some sort of
leg gen
aspect I would start a home service
business um it's the fastest way to put
cash money profit in your pocket period
um and it's the fastest way to learn
people skills and it's the fastest way
to learn sales skills and it's a
no-brainer because you're selling
services that people are already in need
of you're not trying to convince them to
buy a widget impulsively this is
something that they're either going to
pay someone to do in the near future or

[34:00]
pay someone to do in the near future or
that they're going to have to go out and
do in 100 degree heat um themselves
so here's a second option for you why do
I keep looking over there the camera's
right there
um I would flip stuff on Facebook
Marketplace or Craigslist there are
entire businesses of people that just
flip Furniture buy couch for 100 put in
storage unit sell for 500 I knew a guy
that owned a box truck and he started by
renting a U-Haul so he didn't even start
with that and all he did was flip
washers and dryers that's it you think
that guy is ever going to go broke never
he set up alerts on Craigslist anytime a
washer was listed and he didn't even
have automations his alert was his only
automation he would reach out to them
manually and just offer offer offer
offer offer he would just make a ton of
offers and he there's like 8 to 12
things that go wrong in a washer or
dryer that's the 8020 of it right of
course there are hundreds of things that
can go wrong but the 8020 of it there's

[35:00]
can go wrong but the 8020 of it there's
like 10 things that can go wrong in a
washer or dryer he learned how to fix
those 10 things himself on YouTube he
didn't Outsource it he had a storage
unit like a 10 x 20 or something he
would have his Tools in his storage unit
climate controlled he would go out and
buy washers and dryers for 50 to 200
bucks sometimes he'd get them for free
because the the people just need them
gone right they're like hey it's broken
I need it you know I just need it gone
and he knew man that's probably a $50
part he would take them all back and he
would have a bunch of tools on a shelf
and he would just fix them up take
really nice pictures of them and sell
them um and he just put a 100 bucks in
his pocket every time 100 200 250 50
sometimes sometimes he lose money um but
he made a six-figure income just washers
and dryers nothing else um that is a
good first business to start if you were
to ever go to zero all right let's go
back to another pre-submitted question
uh this is from Brady Brady says I'd

[36:02]
uh this is from Brady Brady says I'd
love to create an AI tool that works as
a repair coach for automobiles could
work for a bunch of different things but
this is probably the one with the
biggest Tam Tam equals total addressable
Market eventually it would likely be
video enabled but it would be a tool
that could help you diagnose problems
and coach you through a repairing a
vehicle I know one of the challenges in
these industries is that people
sometimes need experience working on a
specific type of equipment but a tool
like this would enable them to do more
without having specific experience or
training would probably require lots of
funding to start but I'd love to see
this I'd actually like to do it with
medical repair
okay I like this idea I don't think you
need a bunch of funding to start you
could use a bunch of funding to grow it
but here's what I would do if I were you
to find product Market fit on this idea
um I would find a very highly engaged

[37:00]
um I would find a very highly engaged
Facebook group for something
like 1983 Ford Broncos literally
something that specific some a Facebook
group of 10 to 50,000 people in it you'd
be surprised they're out there and these
people are in there all day talking
about this Bronco that they're fixing up
yada yada yada I would build build a
tool specifically for them take that
manual the Bronco
manual and make uh an LM out of it using
AI uh CLA open AI what have you um and
make like a chat bot just make a chat
bot for free make it for free and then
while you're building this start getting
active in the group so you can get like
a like a top contributor badge in the
Facebook group um that will push your
visibility more when you actually go to
launch something and launch a very
specific tool to a very specific
audience and then for free and just use
it to get feedback man I really wish
there were pictures like I I wish I
could upload pictures it's just text

[38:00]
could upload pictures it's just text
only like it would really be helpful if
y or it's like hey it's glitching out
when every time I ask it about the tires
because there's nothing in the manual
about the tires something you're going
to get all kinds of feedback use that to
keep building it out and then build it
out for another model and then start
charging for it um I guarantee you if
you do something like that and start
building up traction start building up a
passionate um fan base you could raise
money for it 100% th% we're going to see
all kinds of AI tools like this and we
already are um for Niche uh products and
services this is a good idea this is a
stud another question from YouTube
Anthony says any hacks for Craigslist I
didn't realize the platform was still
relevant um
Anthony I would use a software called
Cubix Cubix I'm making sure there's a
seal around cubic
Solutions there it is this guy has been
around for over a decade Craigs
automation software if you want to do
stuff on Craigslist this software costs

[39:01]
stuff on Craigslist this software costs
like $4 I have no affiliation but I've
used it many times I don't think it's I
don't think it works on Mac which kind
of sucks um it's a great great software
you can Auto email people as soon as
they list things you can scrape stuff
there are a zillion ways even today to
make a lot of money on Craigslist let's
go to a college student submitted
question okay
Jennifer has the idea for a travel
website where users will have the
opportunity to interact with locals from
different countries I also want to
create educational content to learn
about their cultures history etiquette
and safety while traveling in addition
to Virtual travel experiences the
platform will also offer in-person tours
for those who prefer physical
exploration these tours will be curated
based on specific them themes such as
Cuisine history culture C nature and
more these guided tours are within the
city state or even multiple States

[40:01]
city state or even multiple States
depending on their interest I have been
doing customer Discovery researching
competition and working on my MVP which
means minimum viable product by offering
this platform I aim to promote cultural
understanding Foster connections with
people from diverse backgrounds and
Inspire curiosity about the world
okay travel
website for people to connect with the
locals
um in addition to Virtual travel
experiences it will also off offer
in-person tours here's what I think you
do I think you start with a travel
website like this um to do what you're
saying start with one market kind of
like the idea I just the advice that I
just gave with the the AI idea start
with one very specific things maybe it's
uh it's Americans traveling to Bolivia
right start generating content about
that
um you could use AI to generate it I'm
sure um but then instead of offering

[41:02]
sure um but then instead of offering
in-person tours I feel like you should
or I know you should monetize this by
sending um referrals to current tour
operators in Bolivia for percentage of
their revenue
