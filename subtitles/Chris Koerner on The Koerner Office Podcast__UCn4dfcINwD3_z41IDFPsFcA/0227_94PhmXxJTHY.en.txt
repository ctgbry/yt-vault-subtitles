the 30th ranked business podcast on
Spotify in all of America so I wanted to
thank you guys cuz I jump the rankings
because I post YouTube shorts and then
you guys go listen to my podcast or
watch it here on YouTube so thank you I
just have one ask if you have a referral
of someone that owns an interesting
business that wants to talk about how
they did it please send them to me Chris
coof founders.com I want to interview
them I don't charge to interview I don't
want people to sell anything I want them
to open the kimono and tell us all how
they built their businesses hopefully
businesses that are accessible to 99% of
Americans I don't want to talk to
billionaires and all that I want these
businesses to be accessible so if you
have anyone like that please send them
