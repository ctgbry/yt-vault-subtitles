oh would you look at this freaking thing
right here I can't believe I'm about to
suggest this but here's the sad fact
about life people spend a lot of dumb
money on really dumb products that make
their face look better supposedly if you
put rubber bands around your ears the
puffiness in your face will decrease am
I buying it not for a second are other
people literally buying this absolutely
but it's not a product yet it's just a
life hack it's a rubber band so what do
you do you Source rubber bands you put
them in packaging aimed at people using
it to solve this problem puffy face
syndrome PFS and you sell it you sell it
with viral videos like this one with
this many views you think it's too
simple and too stupid that's fine but I
promise you one day you're going to see
this sold in stores and you're going to
kick yourself full business plan right
