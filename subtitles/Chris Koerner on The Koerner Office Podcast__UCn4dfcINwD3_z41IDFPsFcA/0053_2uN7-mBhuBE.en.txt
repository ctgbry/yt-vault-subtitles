you ever drive by an ugly trailer park
and think how does that place stay in
business well I'll tell you what those
are legal cash printing machines how do
I know because I buy these for a living
here's one that we are buying in two
weeks and I'll tell you exactly how much
money it makes and how we sell nightly
RV spots for $60 a night that's $1,800 a
month we sell nightly tent spots for $40
a night and cabin spots for $120 a night
last year this park right here did over
200,000 a net profit and after we buy it
it's going to do over 300,000 in net
profit because we're adding more cabins
along the riverbank and we're increasing
the rents
