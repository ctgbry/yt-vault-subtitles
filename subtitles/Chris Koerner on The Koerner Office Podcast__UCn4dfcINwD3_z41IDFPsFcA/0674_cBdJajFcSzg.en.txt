today I want to show you exactly how to
sell digital products on the internet but
before you ever sell a thing I want to show
you exactly how to reverse engineer digital
products that other people are selling with
a ton of success also I want to cover all the
beginner mistakes that people often make so
you can save yourself the time and headache
because the thing is there are a ton of new AI
tools out there that make this process a whole
heck of a lot easier so this quick video will
be your shortcut to digital product success
let's get into [Music] it step one we need to
know what to sell unfortunately this space is
jam-packed with scammers and gurus selling
courses i have no course to sell you this is
a free YouTube video and so yes selling a digital
product is easier than a physical product but you
have far more competitors as well because of
that reduced friction so we want to find the
right products that find the perfect balance
between supply and demand so you don't spend
months banging your head against a wall trying to
sell the same personal finance spreadsheet that

[01:01]
10,000 other guys are selling my favorite place
to reverse engineer these products is Etsy now you
can also sell digital products on Gumroad Shopify
Creative Market and a dozen others but Etsy is
the godfather of them all it has the most data it
has the most buyers the most sellers it's publicly
traded and I know how to work the system a little
bit so I'm going to show you okay so there's the
old school way of reverse engineering Etsy and
then there's the growth hack cheat code new school
way both work the growth hack is even better let
me show you the old school way first by reverse
engineering the reviews and then I'll show you the
absolute cheat code way that you're going to love
let's start by sharing my screen okay now when
I go to Etsy on my computer this is what I see
like any other algorithm Etsy is biased towards
my searching behaviors and my purchase history
i just bought a hat on Etsy 2 days ago so when I
scroll down look at that it's showing me the hat
I bought it's showing me products that I've been
researching for content but it doesn't show me

[02:00]
the best products to reverse engineer so I'm going
to do something a little tricky here now this is a
pure look into what's selling on Etsy so I'm just
going to go here and search Printable i'm going
to go to instant download and then I'm going to
filter by top reviews then I'm just going to start
browsing what do I see here 11.2,000 reviews 7,300
750 no reviews so I'm going to open up in separate
tabs some of the products that have the highest
amount of reviews alice in Wonderland whatever
this is prices right sheet digital steampunk
junk journal and then look at this fancy skulls
digital wallpaper 87,000 reviews which means they
could have sold up to a million of these things
because only a small percentage of people ever
leave reviews all right that's five items it's
enough to get us started now for whatever reason
people love these digital printables of skulls
or steampunk out of curiosity let's go to Google
Trends and see if steampunk is trending right now

[03:04]
trends.google.com we're going to go last 5 years
hm doesn't seem to be climbing in fact it seems to
be shrinking in popularity nonetheless we're going
to press on and right here we can see that this
steampunk item only has 27 reviews whereas Pula
Art Studio in aggregate has over 16,000 reviews
so I don't care about this item right here another
thing you can do is go to their store so you can
see they have 702 items for sale which makes a
lot of sense why we didn't see a lot of reviews
for the same item they have a lot of SKs okay so I
already don't really like what I see here on Poca
Art Studio nothing is really standing out seems
like a waste of my time so we're going to move
on okay now Digital Curio here has 87,000 reviews
and only seven for this one item you see a lot of
the trick to this is finding a seller that has
a rare combination of thousands of reviews but

[04:01]
not a lot of products those are the diamonds in
the rough okay now we might have something here
victoria Designs has 54,000 reviews so let's click
into their store okay 452,000 sales half a million
sales but they only have 1,600 products which is
quite a bit less than these other two sellers we
were looking at remember on Etsy's homepage
all we did was search printable which could
be tens of thousands of different things and for
whatever reason it's showing us a bunch of sellers
that sell junk journals but there are thousands
of sellers in the printables category that sell
all kinds of other things coloring pages stickers
napkins math or science homework pages you name
it so we're already seeing that junk journal is
a trending category let's go over here to Google
Trends and see what junk journal shows look at
that junk journals are exploding what is a junk
journal it's a handmade book or journal that uses
recycled and found materials like old book pages
etc okay now here's the shortcut way and you're
going to love me for this we're going to go back

[05:00]
to Etsy and search up the same thing doesn't
matter printable in this case then you're going
to click on all filters stareller star sellers
have an outstanding track record for providing
great customer service yada yada yada okay in
other words they're selling a ton of crap check
that now Etsy used to have a bestsellers category
but they discontinued it probably because people
like you and I were reverse engineering the best
sellers but they still do it's just hidden show
results okay star sellers so this shows the
sellers that are like reliable well look this
entire store has only had 69 reviews so it's not
a very big store they don't have very many good
products or at least it's newer but go to the URL
and replace the word star with the word best and
look all the products change now now you have best
sellers this is freaking amazing let's click on
this silly goose so this is the bestselling
printable according to their search results
okay so 20 plus views in the last 24 hours now
if we click on the store it will tell us right

[06:05]
here 175,000 sales and I bet you a big chunk
of them from this one printable another thing
you can do is use Chad GPT's operator or Manis
manis.im to go scrape all the best sellers on Etsy
the bestselling products and the bestselling
stores okay so we're going to go on this one
29,000 reviews for this store click on the store
462,000 sales across 9,000 different products and
their best seller is right here guess the price
of these baby essentials whoever gets closest to
the actual cost wins so it's a baby shower game
I'm guessing another good thing to learn from
this is how are they listing their products they
have a graphic they have multiple pictures six
pictures it's personalized it's got great design
okay but we're going to reverse engineer this
we're going to take this picture and we're going
to save it and then we're going to go to PixArt

[07:00]
so PixArt is kind of like Canva but AI first ai
powered what I love about PixArt is a lot of these
other photo editing tools have AI integrations
but PixArt lets you bulk edit images and pictures
with AI so for now we're just going to do this
new project sure keep the pixels the same we're
going to upload that image we're going to upload
okay there it is we're going to add AI enhance
because you can only get a certain quality on Etsy
so automatically you look at the before and after
boom it's a ton better apply so PixArt/ any AI
product nowadays really does best with images
artwork and not words as much for whatever reason
AI struggles with words so I'm going to look up
printable wall art and it's funny because even
though you can't filter by best sellers the button
will still pop up when you reverse engineer it
stareller boom look at the images that are on the

[08:03]
screen right now type in best there you go okay so
clearly this Easter bunny just crushes and guess
what it's almost Easter antique white art let's
look at the seller 1100 items 63,000 sales so
we want to find something similar to this so I'm
going to take a screenshot boom we're going to go
back to my files new upload screenshot let's just
see what happens when we click AI enhance okay
okay better still has the watermark on there so
let's play around with the AI image generator here
show me printable wall art of a rabbit in grass
and then you can pick a style boom we're going to
upload the image because we want it to be in this
style okay generate images okay look at that you

[09:02]
got that option that option that looks awesome so
if you want to sell Easter printables on Etsy or
for whatever holiday is coming up next go to Etsy
reverse engineer find something that's absolutely
crushing and use PixArt and their AI generation
tools to come up with some other designs for
yourself now I know what you're thinking okay well
how do I start a brand new fresh Etsy account and
just start selling stuff number one you can use
Etsy ads on a printable like this your cost is
zero it's only your time so the cost to acquire
a customer can be whatever you're selling the
product for less Etsy's fees number two you can
buy Etsy accounts that have established feedback
you're not necessarily buying a full store or a
business or anything you're just paying a little
bit of money for an account the algorithm already
favors but if I were you I would spend literally
four to six hours reverse engineering a ton of
categories printables is just one coloring books
pages all kinds of stuff find those diamonds in
the rough that have amazing designs and that are

[10:04]
proven to be bestsellers with these hacks move
them over to PixArt come up with some alternative
designs and just start listing them and see
what gets clicks or views you can even list
them on Facebook Marketplace honestly Facebook
Marketplace is the best place to test concepts
like this because you could take five rabbit
designs like these you could list all five of
them in the exact same market with the exact same
description a pure AB test you can keep the title
the same even and the price the same and then you
can just see Facebook shows you how many views and
how many clicks and how many messages you get from
each ad which one is getting the most views clicks
messages or you can use this guide and I'll link
it in the notes you can use my Facebook ad guide
i just tweeted this yesterday i got 300,000 views
a ton of positive feedback use that to launch some
Facebook ads $20 budget each same ad different
design see what people are clicking on then move
the winning design over to Etsy and I'll refer to
one more tweet for you this entrepreneur I love

[11:03]
tweeted this first time founder I want to build
something totally new second time founder I want
to be 90% the same and that's where he ended it
and then I commented as the top comment third time
founder i assume that this growing market is big
enough to support at least one more entrance as in
these Etsy designs so I'm going to start by 100%
copying the existing business because everything I
change increases the likelihood that I'll have
suboptimal success over time i'll organically
discover optimizations and changes that make me
unique but I won't make those changes until the
data speaks for itself copy what works change
nothing eventually you'll find things to change
but don't change in the beginning share this with
a friend and we'll see you next time on the Kerner
