[00:00]
I figured John that we'd go over Wills
Creek first and then cover seven Meadows
after that sound good sounds good all
right I'm gonna share my screen and I
also linked to these decks in the chat
so feel free to pull those up all right
can you see my uh screen John yes sir
okay anyway we'll just do quick intros
Chris Kerner thank you for joining we've
got a good handful of people in here
I've been buying and investing in mobile
home and RV parks for a over five years
now first couple years I spent buying
smaller long-term Parks between 2019 and
2021 about those with two partners
across Kansas Oklahoma Texas couple in
Louisiana and Georgia and then I took a
break started writing about it sold the
portfolio in 2021 met up with John and
his partner Jeff last year and we hit it
off we we started with one deal together
we shook hands and said let's just see
how this goes and it went great and so
now I'm a cgp at Blue metric and happen

[01:01]
now I'm a cgp at Blue metric and happen
to be involved and we're doing a bunch
of deals together so John please intro
thanks Chris yeah obviously a Duke fan
went to Duke went to Michigan law school
practiced law as a commercial real
estate attorney and along the way
started a business sold a business and
eventually hung back out of shingle here
I live in Nashville so this park is
about two hours from me and one day just
started probably like a lot of you just
started investing and stumbled into to
buying an an RV park and now there's 20
RV parks so it's been a a crazy run and
I really believe that this sector will
get Consolidated and I love it this park
is the textbook Park I love it it's just
near a good location and it's just we're
buying businesses that that cash flow so
that's the gist and yeah met Chris on a
deal in Louisiana and that deal is going
well and um looking to really build a
portfolio a lot of the portfol you'll

[02:00]
portfolio a lot of the portfol you'll
see in this deck we'll center around a
roughly an8 hour radius around Nashville
Tennessee where I am John can you talk
about Wills Creek and how we found this
and the history and background of this
park and why you like yeah so this is
this park is about two hours from me
it's
down off an in the interstate that
connects Birmingham to
Chattanooga and it's right near it's
actually near it's a park near where my
daughters go to sleep away camp in the
summer so there's a lot of it's just a
pretty area there's there's several
camps there and you get people from
Atlanta and Nashville and Chattanooga
and Birmingham different places bringing
their kids to these camps and it's a
gets a lot of traffic which is obviously
good there you yeah that's perfect you
can see it in the middle there
Huntsville Chattanooga Atlanta
Birmingham and Nashville is just up out
of the screen and it's really pretty
there's that Lake there there's the
country this is 45 ACR and on on there's

[03:02]
country this is 45 ACR and on on there's
a creek that runs in the back which is
not Wills Wills Wills Creek there yeah
and and she we get a lot of this land so
it's really been assembled over the
years by the owner and I've driven by it
in the past not really paying attention
but it has it's stable you could see
actually you can see there it's largely
full just on that screenshot so it stays
largely full there's tons of room to
expand and the back some of that
property is actually quite pretty along
that Creek so there's opportunity to add
RV sites and also to add tiny homes and
on a park like this we've in the past
what we've done is we we can actually
site build tiny homes for around 25,000
a pop which especially in this area
there's a lot of growth this is in the
middle of a lot of big growing areas
like along that path of progress It's
prob it's closer to Chattanooga so
you'll actually get people living here

[04:01]
you'll actually get people living here
driving to different workplaces a lot of
folks in the construction
industry as there are big projects so I
I I like this park a lot and it's not
it's really an easy textbook existing RV
park has history and room to expand
thank you yeah I think we have I think
four seasonal Parks right now and this
is more of a long-term Park I like that
because it's clearly on the way to
higher population areas but I see
long-term Parks as more of a fallback
black option short-term parks are more
profitable but longterm is is easier to
maintain uh stable occupancy all right
I'm going to go back to the deck there
it is so this is a $2.2 million raise
and we have I think 400 grand left that
was all allocated by one LP and he he
liked it because his kids went to summer
camp in the area and then he end up
backing out John that's right yeah it's
that's and we're pretty close to closing
on this

[05:00]
on this
park we we might be able to close end of
this week but we have until we have
another week and a half on this if we
need it but everything's pretty much
ready to go yeah this one's a little
unique because we've had it under
contract for a little while and it
looked fully allocated and then he
backed out or else we wouldn't even be
talking about it today I'm GNA skip over
some of these slides some of them are a
little redundant if I go too fast just
leave a comment and I'll try to answer
it if I see it in time 64 admitted a few
folks from the waiting room okay cool
thanks 64 sides this is the expansion
concept we're obviously going to take
advantage of the space along the creek
it's right on that main thoroughfare in
the city limits of Fort Payne is it city
sewer John is it not right now no but
that is not right now no this one's
septic okay and it already has four
cabins so when we add the ever rooms
it's not going to be that much of a jump
to do short-term rentals anything you

[06:00]
to do short-term rentals anything you
want to talk to about this expansion
concept just that we could even get more
sites out of this it's there's lots of
flat open land here so this is this
considered this phase one of of
development but there's a lot we could
do and sometimes that's we don't have to
do it all we could leave some meat on
the bone there for someone down the road
but there's also the whole Creek front
where we could add more sights so I I
could see this being a park where
there's opportunity down the road to to
do further add-ons
this is what we're looking at for this
park it the returns and financials look
very similar to our other deals a%
preferred return so the LPS would
receive 100% of the distributions up
until 8% and then from 8 to 15% they
would receive 70% of the returns 30% to
us the GPS and then after is it 30% John
it converts to
5050 yeah there's a bump but which
likely happen

[07:00]
likely happen
a lot of times that really happens once
we get to the refi so we refinance
distribute out and at that point we
really are targeting return of capital
for that to happen we target a refund
year two and three only been at this
with this official fund for about 17 18
months now we've had refi offers we
could have taken it just didn't make
sense to the plan is to refi at a 70%
LTV the hope is that rates drop but
ultimately even if rates don't drop the
way we're adding value to these Parks
it's not it's not a necessity this park
is located close to our other Parks I'm
going to go to this map here it would
be right over here uh in between the the
blue and red dots so we're able to
achieve scale like generally speaking
when we buy a park it's managed by the
owners and we're able to split up the
management of a park two or three Parks
between one one blue metric in-house

[08:00]
between one one blue metric in-house
manager I'm sorry it is City water and
city sewer I think I said septic but it
is City water and city sewer okay cool
yeah I think a lot of folks are scared
off by septic but at the end of the day
if you want a 10 11 cap deal that's what
you get a lot of the times a lot of
parks a lot of RV parks you're out just
outside a lot of times that's that City
things are coming but they're not there
yet and or you're on a lake where it
could be hard and you wind up with a
like you're a private sewer system but
here this is city but City Utilities
we're bullish on the RV sector for
several different reasons there's a few
different meat trends that play to it
really nicely Boomers are retiring
Millennials are buying RVs boomers are
traveling more Millennials are traveling
more affordable housing is increasingly
becoming more and more Out Of Reach for
folks so as the economy dips uh we see a
bigger upswing in long-term stays if the
economy is strong we see a bigger
upswing in short-term stays and the more

[09:01]
upswing in short-term stays and the more
realistic risks in this asset class are
generally capex related or expense ratio
related not necessarily occupancy
related at the end of the day if you're
a short-term Andor seasonal Park is
having occupancy issues you could
advertise it more towards long-term
tenants and if you're still having
occupancy issues after pushing it
towards long-term tenants you can always
backfill the park which means buy RVs
seller or Finance them out to tenants to
remove the friction of them having to
own an RV beforehand so you can see that
the industry shrunk a little bit in 2020
but that it's on the upswing and
generally speaking we're seeing a lot
more demand both for there a lot more
demand for our stays than Supply V parks
are recession resistant High barrier to
entry they're getting more and more
expensive to build from scratch and it's
not an asset class that we've seen
really rolled up yet so we're trying to

[10:00]
really rolled up yet so we're trying to
do that John you want to speak about our
track record a bit I believe a few
months ago we we had purchased $30
million worth of Parks worth about 50
million and we're now close to about $50
million purchased close to 70 or 75
million Book value yeah that's right
yeah we've over well over 50 million
purchase now and I think there's and
you'll see how we're infilling a little
bit too strategically with scale I don't
we we don't have anything against
Arkansas in case in case you're Wonder
so maybe we'll find some parks in
Arkansas eventually to complete that
circle around Nashville but the we've
hit the the preferred return on all
parks and we are continuing to look
really at that Circle Inward and really
excited even we're at the point too
where we're having I had a meeting on
Friday with a family
office and we're this I I think the
thesis is holding up there's a lot of
interest in the sector there's
potentially some other cool things
things we could do do down the road but

[11:03]
things we could do do down the road but
there is starting to be in I even had
UBS the bank they their I Investment
Banking Department reached out and I did
a call so that's just where some of the
interest is in the sector and that's our
thesis here is that there will be a
reward for all of us as investors in the
sector for these parks for a portfolio
that's that's managed that's has scale
and in in an area and delivers a return
and hopefully we're rewarded with a
higher exit valuation we got a couple
questions in the chat Nick asked uh what
our going in LTV is for these Parks
isn't it similar to about 70% what our
refi LTV would look like it's yeah we
assume similar yeah there there are you
potentially could go higher some depends
a lot depends on that that valuation on
the other side there's other it's not
just Banks it's also there's Insurance a
lot of insurance companies are

[12:00]
lot of insurance companies are
considering the sector too that was
another meeting we've had recently where
as we show again they want the same
thing though as Bank really looking two
three
years historicals they might take the
sellers historicals too but that could
be a nice a portfolio refinance and they
might go higher on the LTV and they
might go even more generous on the
appraisal side as well and Aaron asked
who our exit buyer is asking you guys
are buying a lot of these parks are you
hoping to in a portfolio deal to private
Equity or similar yes I would say that's
the most likely outcome especially once
we get above 100 million under
management yeah and this I can tell you
that just generally like the sector like
why would a p enter the sector and pay a
premiums it's not just the RV parks this
fits into you're talking that
multi-billion dollar transaction and
this is what I've seen some of the folks
talking to us already are also looking
at Marina operator like us or comparing

[13:02]
at Marina operator like us or comparing
some of the technology like the booking
system used with our V Park so there's
yes a p buyer is a likely buyer another
question seller financing terms refi
assumptions the so the loan is pull it
up I say I believe we're right re refi
just give me one second I'll pull up our
model so I don't speak out the turn
here and I I admitted a couple couple
more people jumped in the room yeah so
we
are
7.95% and a five fiveyear loan it's
actually
35% on the purchase and it's a new bank
we got we had the option 30% or a little
lower interest rat so with a little
lower interest rate on the purchase and
then usually we assume we're around we
assume the same rate on the refi but let
me just check our model sometimes we go
a tad bit lower looking three years out
where will rates be that's a good that's
a good question but we we are at yeah

[14:02]
a good question but we we are at yeah
seven 7% is our assumption on the
refinance rate and then Logan asked
about handling on-site management yeah
so this park so we've that's all the man
we do all the management ourselves we
this park will be overseen by a husband
wife couple they manage another Park we
already own in Alabama south of
Birmingham so they just swing up and
they have there's they do they have a
little triangle of Park so this will be
their third Park for that they manage
and then over them is we have a HQ some
indirect labor we call it director of
Ops who oversees everyone and sets their
kpis and bonuses and all that um but
this this this husband wife couple has
been with they were actually at the F
very first Park bought so I I I trust
them a lot and then Nathan ask what the
breakdown of Duties is between yourself
and I I can answer that you're welcome
to add to it I help with deal flow just
by nature of my audience people will DM
me deals sometimes we don't take most of
them obviously were pretty picky but in

[15:01]
them obviously were pretty picky but in
addition I help with fundraising and
just advising and strategy John has a
ton of experience here I have different
experience I have more long-term Park
experience but primarily deal flow and
fundraising and then John John you're
the guy you're the go-to yeah that's a
lot it's a lot it's it's a lot we but
it's actually I'd say a year ago it was
incredibly stressful six months ago it's
it's gotten as we've gotten
it's gotten less stressful and we're
starting to rinse and repeat on a lot of
these a lot of these Parks but it was
very hard very hard for a while to get
to this place so yep there's some of the
team and there's more now we have
another fellow that a lot of retired
military we have another fellow that
came M was a Master Chief in the Navy
for a long time and does is great at
doing check-ins and making sure every
Park is doing what they should and uh
medicine investor your question initial
loan was
30% on this one he said the sound was a

[16:02]
30% on this one he said the sound was a
little muffled and then emilano asks is
your financial model on argust Argus
Excel or other software and any chance
could be shared on the drive for review
um so the loan value was is 30 30% yeah
we're putting 30% down and then the
interest rate is
7.95% yeah and then our financial model
we could we can share it if you shoot us
an email do we just do it in Excel or do
you have something else for that right
now just Excel I can sh that and then
how are you verifying historical current
numbers mom and pop businesses such as
these can have questionable bookkeeping
practices have you ever had any
surprises once you took over how we any
surprises I there's no no major
surprises I'd say the surpris have been
a little more on the inspection side
that we've had some concealed electrical
in Parts portions of the park usually
not the thing or I'll tell you I'll tell

[17:00]
not the thing or I'll tell you I'll tell
you one area that gets us is the pool
crack in the pool that that the
inspector didn't catch that's been one
on on two parks I'd say in terms of
verifying financials we pull we have a
whole checklist of stuff we ask for them
and and the diligence doesn't start like
our inspection period will get pushed
back if they don't get us everything we
ask for and it's a pretty comprehensive
list so we'll take bank statements so
really it's just crosschecking against
bank statements and then but you're
right yeah sometimes the bookkeeping one
was pretty good she it was wasn't too
bad there was some cash so I think cash
is an area how do we know it's coming
from here sometimes and sometimes folks
will have like multiple businesses and
they'll muddle but this one was
reasonably clean and we have someone who
her job is really just to just to gather
all that information in our diligence
room and compare and we but we tax
returns bank statements
pnls and then do you get any do you have
any cash deposits and then trying to
validate that with bank statements then

[18:01]
validate that with bank statements then
Milano asks how our expenses are saying
staying fairly low even though the park
is doubling in size so she says the
expenses remain the same more or less
when you exclude payroll management for
example utilities are barely increasing
even though you will have double the
users what is is the thinking behind
this low growth in Opex so she had if
you're looking at trailing Financial she
had she definitely had some cash as she
started reporting another way to verify
that is you look at like the s look at
you do a count you go there and say
who's here how many sites and you get
the rent roll from that month so a lot
of times and that's something where the
seller can be a little sensitive about
how they share that as for
utilities the so what one thing we do is
we come in and meter all the sites so if
you don't see utilities pop up that's in
part because we're assuming we're going
to pass through some of that so if we're
adding sites instead of doing a massive
a rate increase a lot of times we just

[19:01]
a rate increase a lot of times we just
like the really the one of the top
levers we pull is just metor the
electric and pass through the electric
maybe not all utilities but at least the
electric pass that through and then and
and sometimes you may lose a few folks
but those may be usually those are the
folks that are burning a ton of
electricity and we're not very
profitable in the first place so and he
asked how we Source our deals that's
that's it's honestly that's work that's
we've got a retired D police officer who
spends all day every day looking he's
got a couple folks calling and we're
starting to get to where deals are
starting to come to us and it's through
even Chris like people Chris will see
deals you you just accumulate them oh
we'll look at Brokers usually Brokers
are overpriced but I don't want to I
don't want to poooo the Brokers like
sometimes there's a good deal too so
it's just I think it's a lot like one
week we called a 100 people and it was
probably like 97 Nos and then a couple
Mayes so it's work and we probably know
just about Park above 50 sites or so at

[20:02]
just about Park above 50 sites or so at
least in the Southeast and then looking
in other areas but it's Mont oh Montana
someone else asked is that Montana the
Rockies it's we'd love to get the
challenge there is we're in National you
saw the map of all the parks it's just
we want there to be scale so it's it'd
be nice to get we have the one park in
Montana now and if we could maybe build
from that so it's just it could be a
good deal but if it's in a place we
can't manage it it's makes it's
challenging so and if I don't remember
if I said this correctly in the
beginning but eight pref it it splits to
5050 after the 15% IR I wanted to
correct after yeah yeah this is the noi
you can see there's a couple different
thresholds here so next year the
expansion would go into effect so you
see the revenue bump there and then it
goes into this this is the projected
returns from $100,000 investment for the
first four quarters returns are fairly
small because we haven't pulled those

[21:00]
small because we haven't pulled those
levers yet and then as we add the
expansion sites it it grows considerably
and then the refinances of course when
you'd get the capital back and then it
would stabilize from there yeah this is
I really love the location and it is a
good yeah something on depreciation
there and we'll see how that turns out
later in the year two more questions
capex amount expected for expansion and
is the customer based long or short term
mostly longterm on this part maybe 60
60% long term yeah and there's more
demand for that it's almost more in the
Chattanooga Metro and there's a ton of
but you could reach Huntsville you could
reach Chattanooga and you could reach
Birmingham and that the grow is it's
right in the middle of even Atlanta is
reachable or the outskirts so there's a
heavy there's a lot of contractors here
and there is transient there is some
transient traffic especially during the
summer so if we yeah I if maintaining
like 60 70 % 80% even long term I

[22:01]
like 60 70 % 80% even long term I
suppose we could fill it but it is one
where you could if you if we can
maintain it and that's where the
expansion really helps you we could have
a nice stable base of long termers and a
little because it's 45 Acres have some
phasing there where we could still have
sites where we could have premium sites
during the summer it's beautiful here
during the summer and then capex amount
uh for expansion yeah it's a it's a good
it's a solid one point can you see it
there it's a well sh right around 1.
1266 is the capex and it's a lot of
that's we can really it's probably more
I know it's more sites than we even have
on the plans so we can expand this park
significantly and just to be clear we
this raise includes all of that capex so
there's not expected to a future to pay
for that let's see there's another
question what if appetite for refinance
isn't there what would a plan B be for
LPS yeah you end up we'd end up just
holding and distributing and going to to

[23:03]
holding and distributing and going to to
whenever the exit is in the portfolio
exit any other questions on this before
we go to the next one how do you decide
on what the lpgp split after the 15% irr
is deciding 6040 or
5050 70 7030 up to the the 15% IR then
5050 yeah really seems correct me if I'm
wrong JN but more of a fun function of
investor appetite or investor demand
yeah yeah I'd say what's the market and
can we deliver a return that the market
like that investors in the market that's
really in practice like to really be
sure we've exceeded the irr it really
gets to that e some event most likely we
have had some that have distributed well
way above 15% so we could distribute our
way there but we don't want until you
clearly are above the break point you
don't want to start you have to clearly
exceed the break point and that usually
kicks in once there's an event like the

[24:01]
kicks in once there's an event like the
refinance just to Tio on this one it's a
$2.2 million raise we have 400 left
we're hoping to finish that by the end
of the week and then the next Park is a
groundup development deal closer to John
south of Nashville called seven Meadows
Which is less of a tight timeline do you
want to talk about our thesis on this
one John yeah so this is about 30
minutes south of where I live it's
you're into the Nashville met it's out
of it's out of this you're not in
Davidson County which is the main
Nashville County it's one of the few
places I think you could build one
there's a ton of demand coming north and
south and east and west through
Nashville you could reach downtown
Nashville a lot of the a lot of the
growth just because of where the river
is Nashville is growing Every Which Way
but this is just direct a lot is growing
South down
65 and it's pretty country and there's
also so there's the Nashville
draw and then there's also Franklin but

[25:01]
draw and then there's also Franklin but
there's also a wedding venue here that's
literally across the street so that is
booked what's the name of that venue
John let me because there's a couple
that had the the same name one second
Allen Brook Farms yeah believe that yeah
there you go this one it's a one second
I'm pulling up I can't see your screen
for one second here yeah we have it in
the deck there second just want I
thought we' put it in there somewhere
it's the venue Birchwood I'm not sure
what you have on your screen you go east
it's called Birchwood yes so it was a
one to the east there it is the venue at
B okay yeah there you go yeah 92 there
oh sorry there we go and so we're just
north and there's there's no housing
around that there's nowhere there's no
place for people to stay so that's the
the owner of that is excited about our
project and we're just north of it on oi
Chun on M Chun yeah mly Chun Road right

[26:00]
Chun on M Chun yeah mly Chun Road right
where that bend is
yep so can you speak to our development
experience at least uh this one we're
bringing in a partner so we're we've
been mainly as you saw from Wills Creek
we've been mainly existing Park do the
expansion so this is ground up but it's
also this is also Natural Area so it's
my kind of my backyard so to speak and
we're bringing in there's a local
developer that's H helping on this
and also the Eric from ever room so
we're going to be putting 100 R RV sites
but also ever rooms which some folks may
have heard of before but there so
there'll be tiny homes and then there'll
be RV sites as well and the ever rooms I
think both will benefit from the wedding
venue but the ever rooms will will
obviously kill it with the wedding venue
that's I think we'll be able to pre-book
here as well but in terms of development
experience Eric's beenin he and his team
and the developer he uses has done a lot

[27:02]
and the developer he uses has done a lot
of developments in the the greater
Nashville area so we've brought in an
experienced developer to really help run
this project so our land development
director has a lot of experience but
he's he's obviously got a lot of
projects going on so he's going to be
more Consulting but the a lot of this
that that needs to take place at a local
level will be a local developer so we're
planning on 85 pad sites to start ever
rooms coming in after yeah yeah it's
there's been a couple different tweaks
to how this can lay out but the yeah I'm
just looking at your drawing so the we
could start cash flowing this RV is nice
for that reason you can get the RV there
and that can start paying for some of
the project before you even complete it
so it'll complete in
phases and then but although the ever
rooms can go in there pretty quickly
they've been building those they come
and they'll be siteb built but they come

[28:00]
and they'll be siteb built but they come
fairly fairly ready to go and then they
they they build them up pretty quickly
and then so really it's Poss it's
hopeful that this year we'll actually
start seeing some Revenue we don't
assume any material Revenue till next
year just as heal how things can go but
this this wedding menu does have
obviously does better in the spring fall
and summer than the winter but it does
have bookings it's not it's not like our
Montana Park where it's like heavy
seasonal
yeah is this 195 projected this year for
basically pre-bookings yeah pre-bookings
and I think we'll be able to get some we
could have some RV Revenue there but for
sure for sure pre-bookings too so it's
I'm hopeful we could maybe even come
north of that number between
pre-bookings and and getting some RV
sites active and this one's a little
more aggressive on the return because it
is a groundup deal there's a little more
risk involved 10% pref 35% Target are
and then was this a 7030 as well where

[29:01]
and then was this a 7030 as well where
is that one it wasn't on that first
slide usually we have a slide with that
let me see if we have it I want to make
sure we have that posted we maybe in the
port sometimes we put that on the portal
as well so people can see it yeah so
it's 10 10 pref 6040 up to 15% IR then
5050 yep there it is I have this other
explainer here in the dock that I shared
and I went ahead and looked at our
assumptions here we assuming 2025 only a
30% occupancy on RV which I feels pretty
conservative um and then
a I think it's it was about 40% on the
ever room because you we have it at 277
which is right in between here yeah and
I think yeah and so this is I think this
is beatable 109 also seems pretty
conservative for the ever rooms yeah the
Playbook is similar to a park that we're
buying outright two to five year hold

[30:01]
buying outright two to five year hold
period refinance year two to three 3.05
X Equity multiple similar to the Alabama
Park just a little more risk so a little
more projected returns I skip anything
here I think that's pretty much covers
it there's one question what would you
say are the strengths of the inhouse
management team around value ad
opportunities I think it's the same
thing I think it's they say the we have
a niche that we've really focused on and
we we're seeing the same there's five
things on every Park and we just do them
over and over again and it's efficiency
and then scale like we've built these
tiny homes before we've laid submeters
before we've managed use the same
booking system before and you just get
get good at it just through repetition
and our all-in costs for this park 735
for the land 200 for improve or two
million for improvements it's I think
we'll land around if I had to qualify

[31:02]
we'll land around if I had to qualify
that sum I think we it'll be more like
3.5 with the potentially with more ever
rooms there and then land 4.2 you could
give a buffer there and even go all the
way up to five and then but this should
be this should be A10 million Park when
all said and done and the thing you just
look at some of the comps in Nashville I
think it's hard to it's hard to hard to
know I'm here so I've we've looked goes
back to an earlier question we've looked
for parks in Nashville and in in Middle
Tennessee and it's just been so hard and
if you think about the portfolio we've
started to come inward we've come inward
until we've were like we need to build
something to get act to really get
access to this Market because the other
thing we're working on is a loyalty
program that will benefit all the parks
so to get closer to Nashville is we've
been looking for where can we build to
have a park that gives us a presence and
hit this MSA and this is the spot so you

[32:03]
hit this MSA and this is the spot so you
look at some of the other parks that
it's just Google like oper land KOA or
some of like just some of the the
valuations it's you're into a top
growing
MSA and it there's just there's limited
places to put just the prices and the
buildability of it there's limited
places to put in RV park a new RV park
now in the greater nationville area so I
think that's to me that's a bigger
picture let's say construction cost come
way above let's say we're at 5 million
we could this should be a $10 million
development or more when all said and
done I think you just answer that
question but Matt was asking about
developing competing Parks um around the
Nashville area it it's getting harder
the Z the zoning and the local
requirements are getting harder and
harder just as there's so much growth
that and we've seen this even outside of
the nationville M say in Eastern
Tennessee just more restriction so if
you're there if you get something built

[33:01]
you're there if you get something built
lucky you because it's getting harder to
develop and build and a lot of that
makes sense we saw in Eastern Tennessee
just near some of the parks there were
some regulations pass just and a lot of
it was for sanitary reasons just making
sure people did if there was septic did
it appropriately or if it was they were
on City SE water that they actually did
what they were supposed to a lot of
people were doing small RV pars or
smaller developments and skirting some
of the the rules and it wasn't really
sanitary that was more of an Eastern uh
problem out in some of the Eastern parts
of the state but so we we sent our
manager to attend the meetings and we
were grandfathered in but we also were
not at risk because we were a bigger
Park we were like that particular Park
was City water sewer but we're seeing
the regulatory environment change some
especially in the greater national area
so I think that's I think this is one of
the spots where you could do something
like this but it's definitely
it's
definitely getting harder with the

[34:01]
definitely getting harder with the
growth bud is asking what our biggest
risks are with this development as well
as what are the natural features in this
development or is the thesis being close
to Nashville Metro population close to
Nashville and close to this wedding
venue Spring Hill Spring Hills growing
in of itself uh the the wedding venue
really it does so well because of its I
I think in part because of its proximity
natural is like The Bachelorette capital
of the country I think it beat Las Vegas
and there's also a heavy amount of
growth especially down south you're
running South like the in the College
Grove was in the Wall Street Journal
it's like one of the top the most
expensive zip codes and most of people
of New York California moving there I
had lunch today with someone from who
lives in College Grove and it's there's
just incredible growth from that shows
no signs of stopping and all these rich
people need a place for their kids to
get married and there's also I65 running

[35:00]
get married and there's also I65 running
up and down so I think it's a
combination of factors that that that
make this a good a good choice and what
about our biggest risks in the
development just going over cost cost
overruns delays timing what is the
timing on development any risk to the
bonus depreciation based on construction
delays do you have any and all
regulatory approvals to build this well
septic and City Utilities
the yeah I think yeah depre you're right
on depreciation some could roll to next
year this year's 60% bonus next 40 so
there's definitely some risk there time
timing when the assets are placed in
service for the tax code so we'll try to
get as much into this year as we can but
and we'll see about whether that bonus
appreciation changes in Congress I don't
it seems like that prior Bill stalled
but then there's an election who knows
the other part of that question do you
have any and all yes so it'll be so City

[36:03]
have any and all yes so it'll be so City
Utilities any and all regulatory
approvals I'm sure there's I hate saying
any know knowledge I'll say to my
knowledge at this point I think there's
there may be things we need to pass
along the way I'm sure there's and
there's the one and one thing I will
highlight there is that we are going to
have to pave the to pave sites which is
was a bigger is a bigger cost then you
don't always have to do pave sites but
it's also it also makes the park more
valuable too some of our parks that are
gravel just seem to eat gravel so it
it's a lot cheaper early on but the the
thing about Paving it though we can
phase the paving so we could you don't
have to pay come out of the gate and pay
spend all the money Paving it you can we
can do that we come back through after
and and do a lot of that and what is the
deadline for this park
specifically John for the fund raise

[37:01]
specifically John for the fund raise
we've got this one goes into June so
we're going to we need to we're going to
close on the land in June so I'd like
I'd like a certain amount we need a
certain amount by the end of this month
so people have a couple weeks i' I'd say
get in a couple I think this deal will
be popular though so that's the other
cave it's we have time luckily which is
nice for a change with as compared to
Wills Creek Wills Creek is will come is
going to come and go very fast but this
one we have have a little more time and
then but I will say if it gets there's
been a lot of interest in in this one I
think too some folks locally on my end
are interested in this one just because
of where it is and they know the area so
I would say I'd say go and probably go
off the end of this month for this one
in your head and then Greg asked is the
fund still open if so when do you expect
to close it will both deals be in the
fund so as I understand it the fund is
still open it's closed when we get to 10
million uh we still have a ways left to
go all past and future deals will be in

[38:00]
go all past and future deals will be in
fund one as long as it's open and it
there's a $25,000 threshold there
instead of
50 majority of our returns are based in
the prospect of refinancing in three
years who is willing to underwrite
Junior debt on a remote RV expansion you
have a primary lending partner what is
the break even cut off on refinancing
12% rates break even cut off that's a
good question I'd have to play with the
monolo rates if I we haven't been
assuming rates are going to be
materially higher so I don't know that
we've looked much north of
8% in terms of underwriting we have two
Banks we've done a lot of loans with a
lot of times they like two to three
years but I've seen them take a year and
because there's a relationship after a
year showing of of of of of operation
sufficient here was the RIS lenan
environment changes a lot but hopefully
it change slight slightly my assumpt our
assumption is slightly for the better in
in in two years and we have not had a

[39:02]
in in two years and we have not had a
problem refinancing and they in terms of
some of our Parks even a year in banks
are willing to we're getting the term
sheets just like on some of the
refinances as Chris said earlier some of
the rates are you know we we're just
waiting a little if it's an existing
park that's stabilized and cash flowing
we're waiting to to pull the trigger on
the refi until rates are hopefully seven
under maybe even under seven in a year
or two or three but I I I'm I think
within just what we're seeing a year of
good financials a solid tax year of good
financials we should be in a position to
refinance and how much of each Park do
we have in the fund it really V it
varies based on the liquidity of the
fund at the time so we're we have to
manage investors what we're putting
aside for
distributions and we have you know the
next distribution will be July one so we
don't want to we have to keep that
reserve and then make a decision from
from there usually it may be a couple

[40:00]
from there usually it may be a couple
percent it may be there are a couple
parks that the fund bought the whole
thing and then there's a lot it's five
five 10% of the park and then Nick just
asked about the minimum on the the fund
I it's 50 Grand minimum on basically all
the parks except 25 Grand on the fund
which we didn't really talk about the
fund much so a lot of people don't know
about it I'll include the deck for that
in the Google drive folder the fund is
the only thing that is a $225,000
minimum yeah and we have folks putting
in regularly there too so that's part of
that rale I'm going to go ahead and add
the financial model to the drive and
I'll add the fund to the drive as well
do we have any other questions that we
could cover so just to recap closing at
the end of this week for Wills Creek
hope to close by the end of this month
for seven Meadows and then we have the
fund option as well that I'll link in
there if anyone is interested you can go
show your interest at the link that I
just put in there mhpg guide. invest.com

[41:02]
just put in there mhpg guide. invest.com
you can just create a free account and
then look at all the decks you can show
a soft commitment there's no obligation
to invest if you soft commit anything
there's only an obligation after you
sign all the loan docs so it goes soft
commitment doc signature and then fund
and and that's it anything I miss John
that was great then I'll say it it may
slow slightly in June so just in terms
of the the earlier question of deal flow
and all that I'd say the summer is a
little less active time for people to
sell so they'll I think we'll still have
some deals but it'll slow a touch and I
just link the folder for anyone that
missed it there's one last question what
is your thinking around a scenario of
higher interest rates SL harder lending
environment for refinance would you like
to wait it out yeah we might be wait
that's why we want to make sure the
property's cash flow so that is that's I
think that's a risk factor for all real
EST any in all real estate
higher interest rates and once once we

[42:00]
higher interest rates and once once we
get it make sure we build it right and
and operate it right and distribute and
then at Le at least we'd be stuck in
something that's Distributing a cash on
cash return that's hopefully acceptable
to all of us yeah I think that's it
thank you to everyone for joining you
can email me Chris coof founders.com
with any questions I'll go ahead and
respond to that right away and uh we'll
see you next time thank you John thanks
Chris see you guys
