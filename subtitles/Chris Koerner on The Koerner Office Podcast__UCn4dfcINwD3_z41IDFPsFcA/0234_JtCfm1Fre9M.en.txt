look at this freaking guy right here so
you're going to keep watching this video
because of what he's doing not because
of what I'm saying but if you listen to
me I'm going to tell you how you can use
this interesting video to start a
business anywhere you live in the world
so if I were you I would buy all this
inflatable crap for a th000 bucks I
would take it out to a state or national
park or river somewhere just like this
that looks really beautiful bring your
phone film a bunch of footage of someone
cooking just like he's doing go to
Fiverr pay someone a 100 bucks to edit
the footage throw up some Facebook and
Instagram ads point it to Millennials
that want a unique date experience find
a private Chef you play matchmaker push
F paid ads towards a card landing page
and start a business charging $500 to
$700 doing exactly what this guy's doing
in your local market you can pay for all
this equipment in two to three dates
this could be a seven fig business
