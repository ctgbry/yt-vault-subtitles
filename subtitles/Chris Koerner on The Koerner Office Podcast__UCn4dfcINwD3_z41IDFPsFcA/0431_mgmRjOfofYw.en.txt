look at this freaking thing right here
so this mom was thinking okay how can we
get moms out of the house to spend money
and to have fun and just relax so she
did something brilliant and she named it
something brilliant which I really
appreciate so moms spend way too much
money to go to a shared space in the
evening it doesn't have to be an
expensive retail space or something that
you lease month a month or year to year
could be someone's house and they
designed some sort of a home decor item
maybe it's a picture frame maybe it's
Pottery or whatever and it's called wine
and design I don't drink wine it's not
my thing but I do like the idea of
giving moms a break cuz my wife is a mom
we have four kids and she needs and
deserves a break and as an entrepreneur
I'm all for monetizing Mom's needing a
break so here's a framework that you can
use wherever you live take something
that already Works mom's painting
together mom's doing design together
mom's doing Pottery together these are
proven Concepts think of something maybe
a little unique different board games
cooking whatever keep your cost Low by
not renting a space and using a nice
house in your area then you can charge
sponsors to come present maybe they're
interior designers or decorators and you
can monetize this in two to four
different ways while providing good to
your community full business plan right
