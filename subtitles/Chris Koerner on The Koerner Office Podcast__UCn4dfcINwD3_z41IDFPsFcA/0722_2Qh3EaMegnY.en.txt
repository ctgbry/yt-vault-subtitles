[00:00]
Do you know who Ryan Trhan is?
&gt;&gt; You inspired us to start a business in
50 states in 50 days on our YouTube
channel, The Corner Office. Oh my gosh.
Dang, you guys took it up a notch.
That's amazing. I love it.
&gt;&gt; That's not possible.
&gt;&gt; Oh, it's not. It's not. I'll tell you
right now.
&gt;&gt; Okay. All right. It's on. And little
twist. I'm going to give the business
away. Do you know how much fire
departments pay to clear acreage by
hand? $28,000 an acre. It's like
government sanctioned theft.
&gt;&gt; You're playing middleman. That seems
like such an easy lift. You just need to
watch the series and you can monetize
it. Each location has over a million
dollars a year of net profit.
&gt;&gt; Oh my gosh.
&gt;&gt; You're telling me you can't do something
like this in any city?
There is this business in Florida, Fort
Myers to be exact, and it is called G
Beach Weddings. This guy started the
business with $20,000. It does $3
million a year. It's very profitable.
It's a wedding service. Weddings as a
service, but it's not a wedding venue.
There's no venue. He basically knows all

[01:00]
There's no venue. He basically knows all
the beaches in Florida, all the
beautiful beaches, which ones have
require licenses to have a wedding,
which ones don't, which ones have a good
sunset at the right angle, which ones
don't have too much seaweed or wind. He
knows all that stuff. And then you go to
him. If you want a beach wedding, you
give him three grand. He's going to give
you a 100 chairs to rent. He's going to
give you a hundred pictures or whatever.
He's going to give you a wedding arch,
some vows. It's a beach wedding as a
service, a package. $1,500 to $3,500 per
wedding. And he's doing hundred
something weddings a year. $3 million a
year.
&gt;&gt; Where is it?
&gt;&gt; So a,000 weddings a year. It's in
Florida. Fort Myers.
&gt;&gt; Sorry, I don't know where Fort Myers is.
&gt;&gt; The panhandle. North Florida. Golf Beach
Weddings is the business. Well, what's
crazy is I didn't realize this until you
and I obviously were friends and you
were like Destin which is right there on
the Gulf as well. He's like you were
like the most beautiful beaches in the
world. White sand looks incredible. Like
no freaking way.
&gt;&gt; You're like yeah it's it's incredible.

[02:00]
&gt;&gt; You're like yeah it's it's incredible.
You're the connector for that area where
it's like I don't want to take care of
anything. Tell me where to have my
wedding and I'll rent from you.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And outdoor weddings twothirds of
all weddings 10 years ago it was 40%.
And it's growing. People want to have
their weddings outdoors. Yeah, it's big
business. That's why luxury outdoor
wedding trailer bathrooms are a thing
because of all these outdoor weddings.
You don't need those if you're getting
married in a church.
&gt;&gt; Oh, I've seen them. I feel like you
could do this in another market.
Basically, the framework would be
&gt;&gt; totally
&gt;&gt; go and Yeah. Go and find
&gt;&gt; some type of popular destination for
people to come to. Vegas comes to mind,
right? It's like, oh, bachelor
bachelorette party. You could do a
service where you're like, I'll arrange
everything for you. the hotel you stay
at, the parties you go to, the clubs,
blah blah blah, just super white glove.
But there's probably destinations like
that in every single state and
effectively you just become the white
glove provider of setting up their
experience. It's all experiential.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a mobile wedding venue. Like

[03:02]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a mobile wedding venue. Like
you want to get married in a national
park, a state park, on a lake, anywhere
beautiful outdoors, next to a canyon.
You know a guy and he knows all the
places. He knows which ones are good in
the morning, which are good in the
afternoon, where they're booked, which
needs a license, which doesn't. This
does not have to be on the beach only.
It It's like weddings as a service. And
I love this idea cuz how much like we've
both talked to Alex with the wedding
venue guy. It's a It's a million-doll
facility that you had to build from the
ground up. You don't need that with
this.
&gt;&gt; No, dude. Weddings as a service. That's
pretty That's That's pretty amazing. And
it's a done for you. It's a done for you
service.
&gt;&gt; Oh, you're into SAS. I'm a WAS guy.
&gt;&gt; Huh? I'm a WAS guy.
&gt;&gt; Huh? What? A wax guy.
&gt;&gt; That's so good. I'm so excited for this.
I know you've told this story before,
but I'm going to bring it back up. So,
have you ever heard of Bies?
&gt;&gt; I'm serious. I'm serious.
&gt;&gt; This sounds interesting.
&gt;&gt; So, there's this there's this company
called Bies, and it's basically like the
Disneyland of gas stations. And I know

[04:01]
Disneyland of gas stations. And I know
that sounds weird to people who have
never been to a BIES, but Bies are an
experience. They've got tons of
selection, great food, they've got
merchandise that is that is unique only
to those BIES and they have a cult
following. And so in the year 2020,
there's an enterprising entrepreneur who
was trying to buy Bucky stuff online.
They don't have an e-commerce store.
What the freak? And so he just decides,
I'm going to go to Bies. I'm going to
buy everything at full retail and I'm
going to resell it. And he starts his
company, yada yada yada. Years later,
he's got a company called Texas Snacks.
They work with Bies. And that
entrepreneur was Chris Turner. Do you
ever measure like how many units of
things that you've sold to people?
&gt;&gt; Hundreds of thousands. Yeah. I mean, so
you have tons of SKs. You literally have
a warehouse. It's a crazy business
because they're not giving you Favored
Nation status. You're going like
everybody else. You're buying stuff off
of the shelf. You're paying full retail
price at the checkout. This isn't like
you send your order to the manager and
the manager looks at it and puts it all

[05:00]
the manager looks at it and puts it all
together and then you meet them at the
cash register. No, your team goes, they
pick, they pull, they pay, they walk out
of the store, they take it to your
warehouse, you list it, you've got
thousands of SKs, yada yada yada. But
it's an amazing business. The reason I'm
bringing it up is because I think that
there are little buckies like this
around the country, and I found one of
them, and I wanted to talk to you about
it. This is called Big Texan Steak
Ranch. You ever heard of this? I've
&gt;&gt; eaten there. Amarillo in yellow, Texas.
So, this is in Amarillo, Texas. Big
Texan Steak Ranch has this thing that
they're famous for where if you eat a 72
ounce steak, you get it for free. Now,
if you're doing the math in your head,
do you know how much 72 ounces of steak
is?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. 4 lb.
&gt;&gt; It's 4 and a half pounds.
&gt;&gt; Oh my gosh.
&gt;&gt; It's a lot of freaking steak.
&gt;&gt; It's a lot. It's a lot.
&gt;&gt; So, this place first opened up was on
like historic Route 66. It's huge. It
gets 500,000 visitors a year. Roughly

[06:00]
gets 500,000 visitors a year. Roughly
75% of them are tourists. Obviously, it
has the 72 oz steak. They've got
merchandise that they sell. They've also
got an RV park attached to it, so you
could actually stay there. There's a
motel attached to it, so you could stay
there. Here's the craziest thing,
though, that I read about it. They sell
over 250,000 t-shirts a year online.
&gt;&gt; Holy. Online?
&gt;&gt; Mhm. No, no, no. Excuse me. Excuse me. I
I lied. I lied.
&gt;&gt; 250,000 t-shirts a year. I don't know if
it's online or not. I just know that's
&gt;&gt; probably mostly in store, which means
half of every person that visits there
buys a freaking t-shirt, which
&gt;&gt; probably close like I would say their
average ticket price is $20, right? That
like increases their average ticket
price by 50%. So I was doing the
research and just based on the volume of
people that are going there, their one
location restaurant grosses between 16
and $20 million a year in revenue, which
is one of the highest grossing single
location restaurants in the world. 16

[07:01]
location restaurants in the world. 16
to$20 million in that one location,
right? Then you add on the merch and
the, you know, the shirts and the RV and
all that other crap. This is probably a,
if I were to guess, 30 to$40 million
business. You're blown away. I Every
time we drive to Utah, which is at least
once a year, we drive by that place.
I've eaten there. I stayed at the hotel
right next to it. I had no idea it did
that much business.
&gt;&gt; You're blowing my mind.
&gt;&gt; And I do think that there are like
examples of this in in other states,
right? These like hidden gems. But why
can't you start a Texas Snacks for the
big Texan steak ranch? Why not? Maybe
they sell online. I do not know. My
broader point was just there are these
types of beloved tourist kind of
attractions in different states. One of
them being that you and I stopped at. I
don't know if you knew this or not, but
that remember the crater that we stopped
at in Arizona, Winslow, Arizona.
&gt;&gt; That's privately owned.
&gt;&gt; That's crazy. I thought Joe Dirt owned
that.

[08:00]
&gt;&gt; Crater. Hardly know her. Anyways, like
there's a ton of these types of beloved
tourist attractions in each state
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; who knows, maybe 10% of them aren't
online or maybe 20% of them are who
knows what it is. But just when you're
on a road trip with your family. Oh yes.
What is that? Sorry.
&gt;&gt; Very excited.
&gt;&gt; That was so good.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Go.
&gt;&gt; So bad good news. Bad news. Okay. Bad
news. Big Texan ships online. Okay.
That's fine. That's fine because it's
not the only restaurant like this. Good
news is I found another restaurant
that's probably even bigger because they
have multiple locations. I've eaten
there a dozen times. If anyone's been to
LA before, Lower Alabama. Okay, LA.
You've eaten at Lambert's Cafe. Okay,
I'm sharing my screen here. One of my
favorite restaurants. It's It's an
experiential restaurant, if you will.
Lambert's Cafe, home of the Throed
Rolls, as in throadedrolls.com.

[09:02]
Rolls, as in throadedrolls.com.
Believe it or not, 67% of the people
that watch my YouTube videos don't
subscribe to me. And over 90% think that
they're subscribed to me. So, do me a
quick favor and check that you're
subscribed to me. If you're not, please
do. It would mean a lot. It's like a big
homestyle restaurant. It's right on the
way to the beach in Foley, Alabama,
hometown of Julio Jones. It's not who
you know, it's Julio, the wide receiver
from Alabama. Thank you.
&gt;&gt; So dumb. This restaurant has a line out
the door 24/7. It's like 25 bucks to eat
there. It's family style. They bring
around black eyed peas. Not the not the
the black are there. Don't bust out into
song, please. Fried chicken, dumplings,
whatever. But they throw these massive
headsized rolls across the restaurant at
you. You put your arm up and they go,
"Throw rolls." And they'll throw it to
you. It's the whole stick.
&gt;&gt; And the kids catch it. They're these
massive rolls. That's their whole thing.
And there's one in Branson, there's one
in lower, Alabama, and there might be a

[10:00]
in lower, Alabama, and there might be a
third one. These guys do tens of
millions of dollars per year per
location. And they have t-shirts and
they do not sell online.
&gt;&gt; No,
&gt;&gt; they do not sell online. Like, it's a
no-brainer.
&gt;&gt; It's a no-brainer. That could also be
very interesting as well. Is you know
what a 3PL is? You had a 3PL? Third
party logistics.
&gt;&gt; Third party logistics company. This
would be similar, but like effectively
you could reach out to this company and
be like, "Look, just throw it up on your
website. I'll do all the on demand
printing. We'll we'll take care of the
fulfillment. You don't have to do
anything. We It's almost like a
licensing agreement."
&gt;&gt; All day. All day, dude. They have three
locations and they own RV parks next to
their location just like this place in
Texas, but they don't sell their
t-shirts online.
&gt;&gt; That's insane. Someone needs to run a
deep research prompt and find all of the
the throat rolls, the Lambert's cafes,
the big Texan, all of those of the world
and start your Texas snacks of those.
That's an idea.
&gt;&gt; I love that. That is an idea. It's a
great idea, too. And anybody who's like,

[11:01]
great idea, too. And anybody who's like,
"Actually, you can't do that." Oh, I'm
sorry. It's already been done by
somebody
&gt;&gt; actually people's here. Okay. We don't
do actually in the comments. Okay.
&gt;&gt; Uhuh. If if you mention liability or
insurance or actually in the comments,
block forever.
Okay. It's funny, Nick, because do you
know how many times I've had the
conversation about this Bucky story and
they're like, "Chris, what else could
you do that for?" And they start
thinking and like, "Could you do that
for Trader Joe's?" Yeah. And it's like,
"Nope. Can't do it for Waw Wa. Can't do
it for Trader Joe's. I've thought of
that. Tried it. Nope. Nope. Nope." But I
actually think for this I've never
thought of a restaurant, Nick. This is
all you. I think this is a doable idea.
&gt;&gt; Looks like after
&gt;&gt; after 19 years of best friendship, you
now have my approval for the day.
&gt;&gt; You said you started talking about an RV
and that kind of gave me an idea. You
want to hear this one?
&gt;&gt; Absolutely I do.
&gt;&gt; Now, you're gonna have to forgive me

[12:00]
&gt;&gt; Now, you're gonna have to forgive me
because I'm going to talk about a state
that is not our favorite. New Mexico.
&gt;&gt; Oh my gosh.
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I'm I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm
sorry, but let me let me share my screen
and show you why I had this idea.
&gt;&gt; I have to look at it.
&gt;&gt; You do. It's not New Mexico yet. Don't
worry.
&gt;&gt; Okay, that's fine.
&gt;&gt; Do you remember Mexico guy? But
&gt;&gt; do you remember Napoleon Dynamite?
&gt;&gt; Of course.
&gt;&gt; This was the van from Napoleon Dynamite.
Uncle Rico's van.
&gt;&gt; Fat lord.
&gt;&gt; Do you know this guy built a business
around renting this van out? He bought
it on eBay for 12 grand and now he rents
it out and he makes good money from it.
And that's his whole business. He he
also bought the Delorean from Back to
the Future
&gt;&gt; and he rents them out. He has like these
movie props, not just movie props, but
like rentable movie props that he can
monetize to super fans.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; I Daddy like you where you're going with
this.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So then if you look over here,
Breaking Bad New Mexico, they you have
three iconic vehicles. You've got the

[13:00]
three iconic vehicles. You've got the
Pontiac Aztec, you got the wagon ear,
and then you've got the RV. Right.
So, doesn't have to be New Mexico only,
obviously, but some sort of a vehicle or
a prop. There is a website called
propstore.com where you can buy movie
and TV store props and you can monetize
them. So, what do you think about this,
&gt;&gt; dude? How much money would I have to pay
to throw a pizza on somebody's roof?
&gt;&gt; That's what I'm saying is like that
house
&gt;&gt; gets a ton of visitors. You could just
post up outside that house and monetize
stuff like, "Hey, how about I take you
on a Breaking Bad tour of Albuquerque
and I'm going to show you all all the
scenes where this happened, that
happened. You don't need overhead. You
just need knowledge. You just need to
watch the series and you can monetize
it."
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, the reason that Chris and I
are acting this way is because 10 years
ago,
&gt;&gt; 11 11 years ago,
&gt;&gt; Jeez Louise. So, 11 years ago, I was
living in Dallas and ended up moving to
Southern California and Chris rode with
me as I drove the U-Hauls. And so we
drove from Dallas to LA and we drove

[14:00]
drove from Dallas to LA and we drove
through New Mexico. And Chris has always
been a foodie. Back then he was using
this app called Urban Spoon. Was it
Urban Spoon?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I remember that app.
&gt;&gt; Urban Spoon. And he's like, "Oh, dude,
dude, this Mexican place on Urban Spoon
is a 9 out of 10. Anything over a six,
you know it's going to be good. I've
been using this for years. You know it's
going to be good." And we went to the
Mexican restaurant. How was the Mexican
restaurant there, Chris? In New Mexico,
&gt;&gt; it was as good as any food in New
Mexico. Total dog water.
Total dog water.
&gt;&gt; It was terrible. And we didn't apply the
the New Mexico discount to the food
ratings. A nine in New Mexico is a three
in California.
&gt;&gt; It's like, you know, being a Boise 9 is
is a California, too. All right. I get
it. I'm in I'm in Anyways, but we we did
drive by the Breaking Bad House. And I
guarantee there are people who have
tried this, but I do like that idea of
finding local spots that are really
popular and you know, maybe building a
tour business around it or the

[15:00]
tour business around it or the
experiential aspect is really cool. So
the RV from Breaking Bad. What if you
just bought some land outside of New
Mexico and then bought an RV like that?
&gt;&gt; Outside looks awful, but inside's just
sick. Decked out. You you know, it's
fitted with with air conditioning. So,
it's like, oh, I'm kind of living the
Breaking Bad life. You know, pulling the
Cody Sanchez of like, I bought three
acres and I threw up a glamping site on
it, but it's it's themed. It's not
necessarily just a glamping site. I
think that'd be really cool. And every
state has stuff like that. Every state
has iconic things that people go and
see.
&gt;&gt; This is the Breaking Bad house. It sold
earlier this year for $4 million. It
sold due to increasing attention to the
house. Basically, the people living in
the house had a miserable life because
they had no privacy. But it's like a
like the fair market value for this
house was like five or six hundred grand
and it sold for four million because
it's the Breaking Bad house. So,
&gt;&gt; do you think you could just put ads on
that house?
&gt;&gt; I think there's a lot of stuff you could
do. I actually tweeted about this when
it first went up for sale. It's not in

[16:00]
it first went up for sale. It's not in
an HOA. I'm sure they're going to like
just give tours, like guided tours for a
fee. I interviewed a guy on my podcast
over a year ago who lives in the flight
path of LAX and for his business on his
roof is advertising. It's like his but
he's advertising for his business and I
can't remember the exact stats but he
tracks it cuz it's a specific link that
he that he only has up for that flight
path and he was like yeah I mean it's
it's worth hundreds of thousands of
dollars a year in advertising for me.
&gt;&gt; That's amazing.
&gt;&gt; It's fre isn't that cool.
&gt;&gt; This house made me think of a different
framework. It's like these people had
been very public who lived in it before
about how miserable their life was. Stop
visiting our house. Leave us alone. Quit
throwing pizzas on our house. There's
two ways to look at it. One is like we
were cursed. Now, first of all, they got
paid to rent out that house to Breaking
Bad to have it filmed. Okay? They chose
to do that, right? That was a choice
they made. And then they were angry at
the world because they didn't have
privacy. They could have been like,
"What a blessing. This random TV show
that ended up being one of the greatest

[17:00]
that ended up being one of the greatest
TV shows of all time chose our house.
Now, we can monetize this any which way.
They could have moved and then like sold
tickets, like given tours. They could
have moved somewhere where they're they
have privacy and monetized it. But
instead, they just complained for a
decade and then sold it for $4 million.
&gt;&gt; Well, and I guarantee the person who
paid $4 million for it was like, you see
how many eyeballs a month? They've got
to be monetizing that somehow. Even if
you just turned it into a Breaking Bad
museum,
&gt;&gt; that's it.
&gt;&gt; How much would you pay to go take a
dump? What's Walt's brother-in-law's
name?
&gt;&gt; We just got demonetized on every
platform. Sorry, Muhammad. That out
&gt;&gt; where he's read where he's reading his
brother-in-law's reading and he like
&gt;&gt; Hank Hanks Hank's reading and he's like
&gt;&gt; Walter White is Eisen Heisenberg.
&gt;&gt; It's a famous scene.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, dude. If you want to go to the
bathroom in that bathroom, it's right
there.
&gt;&gt; So good. I would need to watch that show
again.
&gt;&gt; I like that idea. Okay, so I guess
that's to put a bow on that idea. It's
like movie props, something that's state
specific that you could buy and monetize

[18:01]
specific that you could buy and monetize
in some way.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's it.
&gt;&gt; Also, a couple other data points.
There's Mayberry, the old What's the
What's the show?
&gt;&gt; Andy Griffith Show. In the same city
where that was filmed, they have a car,
like the Mayberry car, where you can pay
$40 to go on a ride in the Mayberry car.
So, there's other examples of this.
&gt;&gt; I love it. Chris, what is one thing that
every guy loves? and don't say what I
think you're going to say because I'll
answer it for you. Breaking stuff,
blowing stuff up, and demolishing
things. All right? When somebody asks
you, "Hey, I got to knock down a wall at
my house. You want to come over?" The
answer's always yes. You follow it up
with a question. You're like, "How many
sledgehammers do I need to bring?"
Right? I just found this company. It's
pretty freaking legit. I'm going to
share my screen. It's really difficult
to know what they do. So, I'll just tell
you the website. The website is
drivetank.com.
&gt;&gt; What do they do, though?
&gt;&gt; I haven't quite figured it out yet. I'm
still looking on the website, but this
is a company in Minnesota where all they
do is rent out I'm going to open this
new tab.

[19:00]
new tab.
&gt;&gt; Oh my gosh,
&gt;&gt; dude.
&gt;&gt; My testoster going up by the
&gt;&gt; Look at this. They're just renting out
the experience to freaking go to war.
Basically, you're driving a tank around.
You're shooting crap. There's a shooting
range and they have different packages.
Check this out down here. Look at this.
The drive a tank packages. Okay, two
passengers. Tells you how much it is.
Oh, a single car crush add-on. Yes,
please. Actually, I'd like a double car
crush add-on. 850 bucks. Uh, actually,
I'd like to fire the 50 cal. Is that
cool? Can I fire the 50 cal on top of
this on top of this freaking tank?
Obviously, there's an unlimited package
where I don't even want to know what you
can shoot. Let's just say The Most
Dangerous Game is a movie that has now
come to life at this place. Have you
ever seen that movie? The Most Dangerous
Game?
&gt;&gt; I don't think so.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, they hunt people. Anyways, Machine
Gun package.
&gt;&gt; Look at this. The World War II. Dude,
this marketing is so good.
&gt;&gt; The World War II package. the Vietnam
package, the Modern Warfare package. So
you're like the obviously the gun.
&gt;&gt; My dad left me as a child package.
She's like, "Dude, what else?"

[20:03]
She's like, "Dude, what else?"
&gt;&gt; My dad never came back from buying milk
package.
&gt;&gt; Oh, dude. I love this. We were all just
talking about the guns that we're going
to be shooting. Okay, here's here's all
the guns that we're going to be shooting
shooting. Some of them are World War II,
Vietnam, Modern Warfare, whatever. And
then this line. Hey, are you looking for
something a little more flashy?
&gt;&gt; A little more flashy?
&gt;&gt; More flashy than riding over cars in a
tank?
&gt;&gt; And then it gives you the extreme
package apparently. Chris Vector
shooting 1,200 rounds a minute.
&gt;&gt; It's insane. This like this is insane.
So, and then obviously at the same time
they offer accommodations. Not only do I
think this business is just freaking
cool. I'm going to scroll back up to the
videos that they have up here. Like I
would go and do this. How fun of a
freaking boys week would this be just to
go play war basically?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But
&gt;&gt; yeah,
&gt;&gt; I don't know of any other companies
doing this in other states. There's no
way that there wouldn't be demand for
this in a state like freaking Texas or

[21:01]
this in a state like freaking Texas or
Idaho or Georgia or like any state that
just has a lot of good old southern boys
that want to go shoot stuff and blow
crap up. Why couldn't you start one of
these? Why could this not be in every
state? Why could there not be an
experience like this other than federal
regulations or state regulations? But
beyond that, why could you not do what's
stopping you?
&gt;&gt; I interviewed a guy that has a heavy
equipment business for kids right in
Houston outside the mall where kids can
get in there and play with an excavator.
Each location has over a million dollars
a year of net profit. Like net profit.
&gt;&gt; Oh my gosh.
&gt;&gt; You're telling me if you can do that for
kids in Houston, you can't do something
like this for men in any city?
&gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. These are just grown children.
Anyways,
&gt;&gt; what's a tank cost? 1,000 bucks.
&gt;&gt; Just kidding.
&gt;&gt; Let's get Shannon on here.
&gt;&gt; You could do this with one tank.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Or you could start You could start small
and be like, "All right, I'm just going
to focus on shooting cool guns. All
right, cool. Let's I got a 50 cal
somehow and just give people the

[22:00]
somehow and just give people the
opportunity to shoot a 50 cal." I
guarantee that crap hurts. Every guy
who's listening to us right now that has
like gone to war is like these sissies
wouldn't last 5 seconds.
&gt;&gt; You have no idea.
&gt;&gt; These guys these guys make me sick.
&gt;&gt; He's like they're like wait a second.
You want to pay money to shoot and I got
shipped to Fallujah without my own
consent? It is a very weird social
commentary on the fact that we're
willing to spend a lot of money so we
can go shoot guns while some people are
freaking drafted and sent against their
will to go fight overseas in other
countries. Anyways,
&gt;&gt; oh my god.
&gt;&gt; Beyond that point, did you find out how
much a tank is?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can buy a T72, but none of us
know what that is. We won't even pretend
like we do for $50,000.
&gt;&gt; That's not that much, dude. According to
one source on the internet that has not
been vetted yet,
&gt;&gt; that's not the I mean, if we were just
talking about renting out RVs last week,
&gt;&gt; and I have to imagine that the like

[23:00]
&gt;&gt; and I have to imagine that the like
price per hour on a tank is going to be
worth a lot more. Uh, I mean, obviously
it's going to cost a lot more to run,
right? But like the video that they're
showing, they're off-roading. They got
some obstacle course sets up. They're
riding through water. Oh my gosh.
There's this guy on YouTube that that my
son and I will watch like it come and
now it comes up on my feed all the time.
And he shoots different caliber of guns
at a target to see how strong it is. So
he'll be like, "All right, we got a
steel plate today. Let's see how it
does." And he's like, "All right,
starting with the 22 starting with 50
cal." And then, you know, he works his
way up to
&gt;&gt; And like you just get to see and he's
got a guy behind it which is a dummy.
And so if it shoots through it, you know
that it got messed up. And at the end of
the video, he goes, "That's the end of
the video." Which I I freaking love.
&gt;&gt; It's good.
&gt;&gt; But like that's me and my son who
literally watch that every single day
when we see those cool videos come up.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You're telling me if I saw an ad that

[24:00]
&gt;&gt; You're telling me if I saw an ad that
was like, "You want to do this 30
minutes away with your son?"
&gt;&gt; It's a no-brainer.
&gt;&gt; Do
&gt;&gt; like would you want to do that or or go
skydiving? I would rather do this. Thank
you.
&gt;&gt; I'd rather go rocky mountain climbing,
but sure.
I asked Tad GBT how much to buy a fully
functional used and old but working tank
and it says I can't help you with that.
It's just not allowed.
&gt;&gt; Okay, dude. You're lame.
&gt;&gt; Overload, bro.
&gt;&gt; Jamie, pull that up.
&gt;&gt; We'll get Jamie to pull up.
&gt;&gt; Is he pulling it up?
&gt;&gt; He's pulling up.
&gt;&gt; 50,000. All right. That's a really good
one, Nick. You did your homework today.
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
&gt;&gt; I'll see if I can match it. Okay.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; All right. So,
&gt;&gt; can I say one more thing?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, please. Drive a Tank. Actually,
I'm not even going to say it. I'm going
to show you it and I want to get your
opinion on it. This is Drive a Tank's
YouTube page.
&gt;&gt; Wow.
&gt;&gt; 85 subscribers.
&gt;&gt; Guys, get with the program. You should
have millions of subscribers,
&gt;&gt; but they they joined December 14th,

[25:01]
&gt;&gt; but they they joined December 14th,
2012. So,
&gt;&gt; dude, that was they joined like during
World War II. What are we talking about?
&gt;&gt; Is this Neville Chamberlain's channel?
They've only had seven videos and 20.
This is We're going to go on on the side
here. This is the perfect example of a
business not understanding necessarily
how big their market is.
&gt;&gt; Dude,
&gt;&gt; I guarantee a couple videos that pop off
on this, you're going to get people
booking from out of state to come in.
Like, you'll be booked out the wazoo if
just even a couple of these videos went
viral.
&gt;&gt; Dude, you know what I'm doing? If I'm an
enterprising entrepreneur, as most
people listening to this are, I'm gonna
reach out to these guys. I I would and
say, "Hey, I want to drive you business
for free and I want to be able to film
anything you do at your business. The
only caveat is I'm going to own your
YouTube channel or I'm going to own a
YouTube channel and I'm going to film
all of your content and you'll get more

[26:01]
all of your content and you'll get more
leads. You'll get more business from it
and I'm going to own the YouTube
channel." This could be a 100k a month
YouTube channel. Like for sure
&gt;&gt; easily dude one
&gt;&gt; whole business just YouTube channel.
&gt;&gt; Look at this. If this is true, if this
description is true, the only place in
the world you can drive a tank and shoot
a fully automatic machine gun under one
roof that is not owned by a government
entity. If that is true, that's in their
description. Okay.
Like
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry. You are leaving so much money
on the table. So much money on the
table. If that is true,
&gt;&gt; I just love the only place in the world
where you can drive a tank. Oh wow,
that's actually crazy. And shoot a fully
automatic machine gun under one roof on
a leap year only that is not owned by a
government entity with a baby boomer
that was born in Nebraska.
&gt;&gt; Dude, so specific. It's those sports
stats football seasons coming up.
&gt;&gt; This is the first time that Tim Tibo has
won in Death Valley on a Friday
afternoon. Like what? Well, and Jerry,
with that catch, if Deshawn keeps that

[27:00]
with that catch, if Deshawn keeps that
up for the rest of the season, he's on
pay for 10,000 receiving yards. Well,
this is just the first quarter of the
first game. I know, but if he does that
every quarter of every game for the rest
of
&gt;&gt; If you amortize that out, think about
it. If he plays for all seven years of
college.
&gt;&gt; Oh my gosh, I love that. That is so
true. Yeah, you break that down. You
only place in the world you can drive a
tank. Oh, really? And shoot a fully
automatic machine gun. Oh, okay. That's
all right. Under one roof. Wait a sec.
Oh, so it's indoors that is not owned by
a government entity. Like, hold. I don't
&gt;&gt; I'm that math meme right now where it's
like
trying to do the math on it.
&gt;&gt; Well, here's another one.
Drivetanks.com.
Okay. Not to be confused with
driveattank.com.
Looks like a very similar website. This
one's in Texas. I knew it would be in
Texas. Dude, it
&gt;&gt; I was surprised this one was in
Minnesota. First of all, their marketing
looks way better than Drive a Tank.

[28:02]
looks way better than Drive a Tank.
&gt;&gt; Driveank probably came first. And these
guys are like, "We could do that so much
better." $3,200.
&gt;&gt; There's Drive a Tank Orlando.
&gt;&gt; Oh, they were in a Mr. Beast commercial
and a Dude Perfect commercial or video.
&gt;&gt; Oh, I guarantee that that company's
freaking crushing it then.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, they're crushing it. They've
been in a Dude Perfect and a Mr. Beast
video.
No way.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; See, that's how you do it.
&gt;&gt; That's how you do it.
&gt;&gt; I still think this Minnesota company
like I I don't understand. To your
point, again, what's the downside to
just point shoot, upload, point, shoot,
upload. They don't even have to do any
editing really. Like I guarantee their
YouTube channel would grow if they were
just consistent. Even if they were all
like portrait videos that were placed
on, you know, the 9 by6, you know what I
mean? Like they would still blow up.
&gt;&gt; Pun intended,
&gt;&gt; dude. Yeah, they have 116,000 Instagram

[29:00]
&gt;&gt; dude. Yeah, they have 116,000 Instagram
subscribers and 13,000 YouTube
subscribers. So,
&gt;&gt; I wonder if it's the same. It can't be
the same company.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I doubt it.
&gt;&gt; All right. You know, I'm always talking
about data, the numbers that actually
matter because you need data to grow.
And you need to grow to make real money.
Beehive is the newsletter platform that
I've used for over a year and a half.
Because of their data? Well, for
multiple reasons, but especially because
of their data. Yes, most platforms will
tell you someone opened your email.
Cool. But Beehive tells you everything.
Engagement drop off, which links people
ignore, and which ones they click again
and again, what keeps readers scrolling.
You get real time subscriber insights,
AB testing results, even predictive
analytics measures. It's like having
your entire subscriber base give you
feedback live. And you can set up
automated sequences, welcome emails,
re-engagement campaigns, all based on
that behavior. Because the truth is, if
you can't measure it, you can't improve
it. And Beehive shows you what's

[30:01]
it. And Beehive shows you what's
actually happening. So head to
beehive.com/chris
for 30% off three months. That data will
change how and what you write. All
right, I'm going to give you a choice.
You choose your own adventure right
here, Nick. Okay. You ready?
&gt;&gt; I'm here. I'm in.
&gt;&gt; Just like the parable in the Bible of
the goats and the sheep, I'm going to
give you an option. Goats or donkeys.
Which way are we going?
&gt;&gt; Goats.
&gt;&gt; Okay. You ready?
&gt;&gt; Took everything I had to not swear.
&gt;&gt; Oh gosh.
&gt;&gt; Just want you to know.
&gt;&gt; Oh gosh.
&gt;&gt; That's what you were doing. That makes
sense.
&gt;&gt; I just want you
&gt;&gt; Thank you
&gt;&gt; to know that.
&gt;&gt; I've given Muhammad enough to edit out.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
Did you know that gas, goats as a
service is a thing and it is quite
profitable?
Especially in California, our country's
biggest state by population.
&gt;&gt; Goats as a service. What is that?
&gt;&gt; Goats as a service for two for two
reasons. Oh, really? You could use goats
for three reasons. Wildfire prevention.

[31:00]
for three reasons. Wildfire prevention.
They eat out all the underbrush because
I've owned goats. I've had goats in my
backyard. They don't like the grass. The
cows like the grass. The goats like the
weeds. They go to the weeds first,
right? So, if you let a bunch of goats
loose in an overgrown lot, as long as
you fence them in, they will eat those
weeds in in a matter of seconds, right?
Enough goats,
&gt;&gt; they will eat it up. So, there are
businesses in California that offer
goats as a service for brush clearing
and for wildlife prevention. And so fire
departments will hire them and pay them
$500 to $1,000 an acre to load up their
animal trailer full of goats, release
them, put up some temporary electric
fencing, and clear land, and then
they'll come back and get them. $1,000
an acre. You do you know how much fire
departments pay to clear acreage like
manually by hand as opposed to $1,000 an
acre? No.
&gt;&gt; $28,000 an acre.
&gt;&gt; 28,000.
&gt;&gt; How do you know this? That's like a
number that's readily available.
&gt;&gt; I've looked it up.
&gt;&gt; The freak. $28,000 an acre

[32:02]
&gt;&gt; The freak. $28,000 an acre
&gt;&gt; according to cal matters.org.
According to a nonprofit California
website.
&gt;&gt; Oh, so this is $42,000. It's estimated
$28,000
to clear an acre. That sounds insane,
right?
&gt;&gt; It's public information cuz fire
departments are paying for it. Yeah. But
if you use goats, it's $1,000.
&gt;&gt; Dude, screw the goats. If they're if
they're spending $28,000 just gonna be
like, "Hey, I'll I'll do it for 20."
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; How How long is it gonna take me? An
hour on my John Deere?
&gt;&gt; Dude, there was a city in California,
Nevada City in California. They had a
goat fund me. Okay. They raised
$30,000
to acquire goats to munch through acres
of vegetation that could fuel wildfires.
Goat Fund me. That's incredible.
&gt;&gt; $30,000 worth of goats.
&gt;&gt; Can we start a business called goat
munchers?
I mean, it just sounds funny. There's
like no connotation. Goat munch. That

[33:00]
like no connotation. Goat munch. That
just sounds funny.
&gt;&gt; It is. Oakland, California spends half a
million dollars a year on goat grazing.
&gt;&gt; Do you have an estimated like TAM? Maybe
not even TAM.
&gt;&gt; I wish I did.
&gt;&gt; What's the goat industry in California?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, TAM means total addressable market
for those listening. I don't know. But
it's this isn't just a California thing.
This is like for wildfire prevention,
it's mostly in California, but for land
clearing, it's in every state. Like I've
seen viral Instagram videos of people
that own these businesses and it's kind
of like the pressure washing guy or the
the lawnmowing guy that knocks on
people's doors, does it for free,
spowing, there there are guys that do
that with goats. They'll let a bunch of
goats and they'll put up a camera with a
time lapse and we'll watch the goats
munch through it all. One of the things
that we talk about over and over on
this, I don't know we've ever said it
this way, but are businesses where you
play the middleman or wholesaler.
&gt;&gt; I was just going to talk about that. I
was just going to talk about that.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; You don't necessarily hold the
inventory, but you're the guy or gal who

[34:00]
inventory, but you're the guy or gal who
finds the buyer and the seller and
places them together.
&gt;&gt; Why could you not start a business where
you just are contacting farm owners and
then you're playing middleman with local
municipal municipalities? That seems
like such an easy lift
&gt;&gt; moment. Wait right there. I'm going to
share my screen. This is unprepped. If I
look like an idiot, I'll just have
Muhammad and edit it out, but I won't.
Okay, for those listening only, I'm
going to Facebook Marketplace. I'm going
to search marketplace and I'm going to
say bore goat. A bore goat is a very
common breed of goat. I've owned them.
Bore goats for sale. Okay. B O E R. You
look it up. Look how many options.
&gt;&gt; A real boar.
&gt;&gt; Sheesh.
&gt;&gt; Look how many options there are. It just
keeps going and going and going. Right.
These are goat farms radius.
&gt;&gt; This is within 90 miles of Dallas,
Texas. So this is the DFW metric,
&gt;&gt; but these are goat farms that are
actively selling on Facebook
Marketplace. This is a small fraction of
the goat farms. How many of these guys
are charging for goat grazing? Probably
almost none of them, right? So if you

[35:00]
almost none of them, right? So if you
want to play middleman or woman, you go
acquire customers, put up a website,
Facebook ads, Google ads, what have you.
People that need lane clearing, brush
clearing, and just play middleman. You
be the lead source. go get their you you
could probably use their animal trailer
because any farmer has an animal
trailer. Load it up. Say, "I'll have
your goats back by 11 p.m. I know the
curfew, sir. Thank you so much. I'll
take good care of your goats."
&gt;&gt; Right.
Some
&gt;&gt; Yep. And you go you you fence them in
and uh they get to work. You charge 500
an acre.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I like that. Then like for that.
&gt;&gt; So, all right. So, I get that side of
the equation where it's like, "All
right, we can go get goats." How would
you find the other side of the equation,
like the the demand side, right? I'm
guessing,
&gt;&gt; yeah,
&gt;&gt; the the county of Oakland or the city of
Oakland in California, those are city or
county contracts. It's probably going to
take a while. They probably have to go
through a competitive bidding process.
It's knowable, but it's still a long
sales cycle. The land clearing, that
one, I don't know the answer to.

[36:01]
one, I don't know the answer to.
&gt;&gt; I wouldn't worry about the government
contracts, like you said, because it's
so hard. I would just go the forestry
mulching route. Like the dude I
interviewed who has a forestry mulching
business in Cincinnati. He uses Facebook
ads. That's it. He spends $23 for a
lead. He closes 49% of all his leads.
His average job size is $3,100. So he
spends $46 to acquire a $3,100 customer.
Just do the same playbook except your
videos spread even more organically
because it's more viralable than a
bobcat munching down a tree. It's a goat
munching down trees. It do even better.
Uh, so you would target land owners on
Facebook.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. What this guy does is he uses meta
ads only to zip codes that have rural
like large tracks of land 35 years and
older and people that show an interest
in tractor supply. Those are land
owners. That's his whole strategy. So I
do that with goats. You don't need to
have a farm. You don't need to buy the
goats. You just borrow them. It's a
simple borrowing of a goat. We've all
been there.

[37:00]
been there.
Did you see that video I posted about
Ryan Tran? Do you know who Ryan Trhan
is?
&gt;&gt; Honestly, I did not know who Ryan Trhan
was until you posted that video.
&gt;&gt; Okay, so this kid, he's from Texas, went
to college at Texas A&M. He was like a
state champion runner up for cross
country in high school. Super likable
guy. He's blonde. He's like late 20s.
And he's a YouTuber. He's got 20ome
million subscribers. Kids love him,
adults love him. He's really
charismatic. He's got the riz. Anyway,
he's doing this series where he's
visiting 50 states in 50 days, which of
course me and my family, we visited 50
states in 60 days, right?
&gt;&gt; Yes, you did.
&gt;&gt; So, we're watching as a family and it's
super good. And he's raising a million
dollars for St. Jude's. And he said, "If
you donate $5,000, I will say thanks on
one of my videos." And his videos get
&gt;&gt; that was it.
&gt;&gt; His videos get four to 10 million views
each. Right.
&gt;&gt; Wow. Okay.
&gt;&gt; And so Kamal, this is Kamal's idea. I
can't claim it. He's like, "What if you
started a business in 50 states in 50

[38:00]
started a business in 50 states in 50
days?" And like it didn't even go
through the cycle of like, "That's
crazy. Who would do that?" Then me
thinking it's good. Like immediately
it's like that's an amazing idea. That's
something that I would do, I would love
doing, and I I will like immediately I'm
like, "I'll do it." Talked to the wife
about it and she's like, "Heck yeah,
let's do it." Because those two months
when we did that were the best two
months of our lives. It was the the
best. Absolutely not even close.
&gt;&gt; Wow.
&gt;&gt; All day, every day with your family,
seeing a new state every day in an RV,
like adventures and getting stuck and
like it was just incredible. So, we're
going to do it again next summer and
we're going to I'm going to start a
business with my kids in every state in
50 days
&gt;&gt; in every single like how do you even do
that?
&gt;&gt; In all seriousness, this is going to be
a chip on shoulder moment, but like
that's not possible.
&gt;&gt; Oh.
It's not. I'll tell you right now.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. All right. It's on.

[39:00]
&gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. All right. It's on.
&gt;&gt; You know what? Okay. If there's a
betting line out there, so our Poly
Market is sponsoring this podcast. So,
let's get a betting line over under
whether or not Chris starts 50
businesses.
&gt;&gt; First of all, let's start by defining
what a business is. Okay.
&gt;&gt; According to this challenge, and I'm
making up the rules here. This is my
challenge.
&gt;&gt; Business or business?
&gt;&gt; Take your pick. depending on which state
you live in. Okay?
So, a business, I'm not going to file an
LLC. I'm not going to have an EIN or a
license. I'm going to start
approachable,
you know, low cost of entry, low barrier
to entry businesses in every state that
is something that could be started in
eight hours or less. I started a
business in 56 minutes live on YouTube
last week.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, farmers market business,
service business, door-to-d dooror
cleaning gutters, pressure washing. I go
buy a pressure washer. I go buy a pizza
oven at Home Depot, then I post up at a
farmers market the next day. I just use
the skills that I have to start

[40:00]
the skills that I have to start
businesses in every state. Maybe it's
even an online business and I happen to
be in North Dakota while I'm starting
it.
&gt;&gt; So, the the idea is could I generate a
dollar in a day
&gt;&gt; while I'm in this state? And it could be
any of those things. It could be
pressure washing. It could be selling
e-commerce. It could be selling a
course. like whatever it is like
&gt;&gt; could be flipping stuff on Facebook.
&gt;&gt; Flipping stuff on Facebook marketplace.
Could I generate a dollar and how would
I do it in this state? That is doable.
Yeah, that's doable. Dang it. Dang it.
We need to change the betting line.
&gt;&gt; No, it's set. Muhammad, edit that in.
And this is like I'm like no bones about
it. I'm blatantly copying Ryan Trean's
concept, but putting a business angle on
it. I love the concept. And you know
what? Guess who saw 50 states before
Ryan Trean did? this guy did.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Sorry. Sorry.
&gt;&gt; Going back.
&gt;&gt; And a little twist. I'm going to give
the business away. Whatever you call a
business, that's not going to be
anything very impressive. I'm going to
give it away to a local in the area and
I'm going to give him all the revenue
that I generated to like help him run it
as like operational expenditures.

[41:00]
as like operational expenditures.
&gt;&gt; First of all, I love the idea. Second, I
think you said that Ryan like Ryan Tran
would have people pay him in order to
get him to thank them on their videos.
&gt;&gt; He raised money for St. Jud's a
nonprofit and if you donated 5,000 or
more, he would shout you out on his
video. So, I'm going to play this video.
So, this is a clip from Ryan Tran's
episode where he's thanking me. And
there were like dozens of people on this
one episode, this one day that donated
over $5,000. I was just one of them. So,
here we go.
&gt;&gt; 50 said in 2022, our family saw 50
states in 60 days. You inspired us to
start a business in 50 states in 50 days
on our YouTube channel, The Corner
Office. Oh my gosh. Dang, you guys took
it up a notch. That's amazing. I love
it.
&gt;&gt; That's it,
&gt;&gt; dude. So, that was like the official
launch and I had kids come up to me at
church
&gt;&gt; and like, "Dude, I saw you on Ryan
Trean. You're you're going to see all 50
states?"
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, was that video literally just him
like, "Hey, I'm here thanking people
because they paid $5,000."

[42:00]
because they paid $5,000."
&gt;&gt; That was one of many one of many thanks
he gave out in that one episode.
&gt;&gt; And that episode will will still get
three to four million views. It already
has. Yeah,
&gt;&gt; that is mindblowing, dude. You know
what's crazy to me? I was just talking I
went and visited I told you a guy in my
ward's business. He's a a carpet
cleaning company, ZeroRes, here in
Boise. And he was talking to me about
how he gets customers and like radio was
really big for them for a while. He's
like, I haven't really seen the ROI. So,
he stopped. He was spending a lot of
money on radio per month. He stopped and
he didn't see a drop off. You spent five
grand for Ryan Tran to shout you out.
How many millions of people saw that?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, about 5 million. Like if you were
to just do the cost analysis of whatever
the CPM is, right? Like
&gt;&gt; it's like $10 CPM basically.
&gt;&gt; It's a no-brainer.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, do did you hear about
electric bikes? Have you ever heard of
that company?
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; Okay. It's an electric bike company
called Electric. And in his second
episode of 50 States, they donated
$100,000. It's the end of every episode.
He would just start swiping on his

[43:00]
He would just start swiping on his
donations with his wife. And he came
across that and he's like shocked. He's
like, "What? $100,000?" And then they
showed up at his house and they were
they gave him a bike, which he did not
expect. And then they said, "If you ride
this every day in every episode, we'll
give you $10,000 more dollars per day
that you ride this."
&gt;&gt; And he's like, "Holy crap, you're so
generous. Thank you so much." But if you
add up the 250 million views that his
series gets against the $600,000 or
whatever they donated to him, it's
nothing. Like, it's pennies. And now if
you go look at like electric bikes,
Google trends, keywords, backlinks, they
are blowing up. They are like the de
facto electric bike company now because
of that $600,000 investment.
&gt;&gt; I know that's not what we were planning
on talking about right now, but you put
out an episode that was like, if you
could play the lottery for free every
single time, why wouldn't you? And you
were talking about short form video,
right? Like just the ability to grow an
audience and outreach. to me like that's
that's as a creator is we're talking
about like the other end of the spectrum
here as someone who's buying media. It

[44:02]
here as someone who's buying media. It
just seems it's that's kind of like a
lottery ticket as well. I think it's a
little bit less less risky, but like
yeah, $5,000 for someone to see or hear
about me four million times.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Also, like I'm donating to like,
you know, help treat kids cancer, you
know, like worst case, I'm helping kids
with cancer.
&gt;&gt; Geez. All right. So, what do I think
about your idea? Same. I freaking think
it's genius. Are you thinking
logistically? You could just do like the
same thing in every state. You know what
I mean? It's like I'm just going to flip
something on Facebook Marketplace. And
so, it's like it could be a different
item every single state, but it's all
Facebook Marketplace based and then it
would sort of take out the mental lift
every single time. Are is that how
you're thinking about it or are you
thinking like, "Nope, it's got to be a
different thing every single time."
Because that those are two very
different lifts.
&gt;&gt; I want it to be unique. I want every
video to be different and unique. And
ideally, I start businesses that are
kind of unique to that state, you know,

[45:01]
kind of unique to that state, you know,
but I've got 10 months to plan this. And
so I'm probably going to be hiring
someone like just for this project, like
an assistant to call do logistics
because like if I'm if I'm going to
Montana and I'm coming through like the
southwest corner, I can't start a
business way up there in Glacier
National Park. It doesn't work. I have
to find a business that would fit in
that corner because I just don't have
time to drive all over every state. I've
got to hit the perimeters like we did
three years ago as a family. So, there's
ton of planning like I got to have plan
A, B, C for each state because like what
if I what if I'm going to sell pizzas at
a farmers market and then the farmers
market gets rained out? I got to have a
plan B, you know?
&gt;&gt; I think it was SPAR. I can't remember,
but there are examples of people
starting up uh almost like local yellow
pages in their local markets. It was
like a renters. I couldn't remember.
Dang it, I can't remember exactly what
it was. The gist is people are
interested in their local markets and so
if they see a link that's like the top

[46:00]
if they see a link that's like the top
10 restaurants to eat in Boise, Idaho or
the top 10 restaurants to not eat at in
Lucas, Texas.
&gt;&gt; Oh, you're talking about his his
roommate finder in San Francisco.
&gt;&gt; That's what it was. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Like they're going to click on those.
So, for this to be maximally effective
for you, Yeah. you do want to do all
that research. It's like, okay, if I'm
going to Wyoming, what are the top 10
things in that state that are going to
be most attractive to those people? How
am I going to get them interested in it?
How do I make it unique? Like there's a
ton of work for then each one of those
even if you're flipping one thing on
Facebook.
&gt;&gt; You just saying Wyoming gave me a great
idea. Like you know there's a whole
industry in like Wyoming and Montana for
shed hunting where like every season on
a certain day are alive. You got to
chase these sheds down.
&gt;&gt; The season opens up where you can go
find elk antlers that the elk shed
during the winter and you sell them for
a lot of money. And so like people will
wait until sun up and then as soon as
the sun comes up legally they all go
rush out with their backpacks and with
their dogs and they'll just start
looking for elk antlers and then they'll

[47:00]
looking for elk antlers and then they'll
strap them to their backpacks and then
at the end of the day they'll all come
back with sometimes like hundreds of
pounds of antlers on their shoulders and
then they'll carve them up. They'll sell
them. They'll sell them as dog bones.
They put them on the wall. Like what if
one of my episodes was shed hunting in
Wyoming and you could only do that in
Wyoming, you know? Like that would be
awesome. and then I have to go sell it.
&gt;&gt; Or what if it was like, "Oh, I know for
a fact anybody who goes to Zans's
National Park has to either get an
orthotic or sunglasses." Let's just say
it's sunglasses.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I'm going to go to every gas station
that I know is at a choke point that
goes into Zans and I'm going to launch a
product in those gas stations, right?
Like that's my project for for Utah.
Like every single state is going to have
a similar type thing that you can do the
research on and then find that is going
to be unique to it. But yeah, you
definitely had to hire somebody for
that.
&gt;&gt; Or I could be like a tour guide for the
most famous hikes and like Narrows, the
Narrows hike. Like, hey, give me 30
bucks. I'll take 10 people and I'll give
you guys all like the history and the
behind the scenes of the Narrows hike.

[48:00]
behind the scenes of the Narrows hike.
You know,
&gt;&gt; Chris, Chris, this would be really cool.
I don't know how big of a team you'd
have to do, you'd have to hire out for
this, but this potentially is awesome.
You could reach out to the state tourism
board for every state and say, "This is
what I'm doing. This is the number of
subscribers I have." Like, you have a
couple million. It's legit. I'm coming
to your state. A, who do you think I
should go talk to? But B, they might
have some state funds for this. Like,
states set aside money for their tourism
boards so that they can, you know,
attract people to it. You might be able
to get some of these businesses funded.
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
&gt;&gt; That would be that would be really cool.
That's what Ryan Tran I mean he got to
stay in a free Airbnb every night and
Airbnb didn't officially sponsor it or
else he would have legally had to put
like #Air Airbnb sponsor and he didn't
and I'm sure he would have but they paid
for all of his stays and he stayed in a
different unique Airbnb every night
which was like another retention hack.
Like I want to see the potato that he
stays in tomorrow. You know
&gt;&gt; what if you did this instead? What if
you said hey I'm opening up applications
for any entrepreneur around the country.

[49:00]
for any entrepreneur around the country.
I'm going to choose one person from each
state. Just hear me out before you cut
me off. I'm going to choose one person
from each state, pitch me your idea, and
then when I get to your state, we're
launching the business. So, it's like
you're just staying in your zone of
genius, which is
&gt;&gt; I'm going to show you how you can go
from zero to dollar in one day. And so,
maybe for one person, it's Facebook and
meta ads. Maybe for another person, it's
you go to outscraper and get a bunch of
text messages and then and then that's
how your landing business. Maybe for
another person it's optimizing Google
LSA. whatever it is. That way the lift
is a little bit lighter for you and
there's an easy handoff to a person in
that state that you can then come back
to and say, "How's this business doing 6
months later?" I don't know if you do
that, but that might be a really cool It
might be a dumb idea actually. Just
&gt;&gt; No, I think it would add to the intrigue
a significant amount. It would also add
to the logistics a significant amount.
So, the question is, would that be worth
it? You know,
&gt;&gt; would it add to the logistics?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, because now I have to manage 50
relationships in every state and what if
they flake out on me? What if they don't
show up? You know, so but what I was

[50:01]
show up? You know, so but what I was
going to say, if I'm going to have plan
A, B, C for every business anyway, then
plan A might as well be with another
entrepreneur and then plan B and C could
just be solo, you know,
&gt;&gt; dude. Or you could TK owners members.
Like there could be some people that you
kind of handpick there
&gt;&gt; where you're not just necessarily
starting from scratch. Like you have
some relationships in there. There's
always a chance somebody flakes out, but
that might be a good place as well. I
love this idea, man. Like I don't know.
What do you want me to say, Chris? What
do you want me to say? You've done it
again. You're a genius.
&gt;&gt; Tell me it's going to fail and it'll be
extra good.
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah. I mean, like every other
business you've ever started in your
entire whole life, it's going to fail.
Chris,
&gt;&gt; how big of a chip did that just put How
big of a chip did that just put on your
shoulder? Be honest.
&gt;&gt; I'm sitting like this.
&gt;&gt; Sounds. Oh, that's I'm sorry. That's not
Quasimoto. That's just Chris with a chip
on his shoulder.
&gt;&gt; Quick question. What if there were a
private community out there of people
that were building businesses based on
this podcast? Well, I just made it and
it's only for business starters and

[51:01]
it's only for business starters and
business builders. It's called TK owners
and it's basically like having me and
100 other business geniuses as your
business partner. Also, there's going to
be exclusive new trends, growth hacks,
business ideas, and a database of
everything I've ever talked about.
You'll find thousands of startup case
studies. You'll have weekly ask me
anythings with me while I'll answer your
questions directly. You can join now at
tkowners.com. Link in the show notes.
&gt;&gt; It's petty, but it would be really cool.
Take an RV, use it, and then as you're
doing the 50 states in 50 days, every
single day, show that after you're back,
right? So, let's say you're in June, you
open up bookings for October and you
just show every day bookings that are
coming in for your RV that you're
driving around. And then you look at all
the people who are like, you can't start
an RV com. and you'd be like, "Oh,
that's that's so weird. I'm booked out
booked out for the next nine months. H
I'm driving with my family right now and
and yet I'm I'm getting revenue up
front." It's weird. It's what we call a
negative cash conversion cycle. You ever

[52:00]
negative cash conversion cycle. You ever
you ever heard of it?
&gt;&gt; So that's uh summer 2026.
&gt;&gt; It's going to be awesome.
&gt;&gt; We'll see.
&gt;&gt; Chris, what happens to all the unclaimed
baggage that the airlines don't know
what to do with? Do you know? Do they
just throw it away?
&gt;&gt; They don't.
&gt;&gt; No, they don't. I didn't know this, but
after like after 90 days of an unclaimed
period, all the unclaimed baggage in the
United States goes to one place because
there's only one place that is licensed
to resell unclaimed airline baggage and
that is
&gt;&gt; unclaimed baggage in Scottsboro,
Alabama.
&gt;&gt; Freaking Where is Scottsboro, Alabama? I
don't even know where that is.
&gt;&gt; It's northeast in between Chattanooga
and Birmingham.
&gt;&gt; Is it in the middle of nowhere?
&gt;&gt; Yes, it is.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, this place gets between five
and 7,000 pieces of luggage every single
day. Every single day. It's nuts to me.
It's this 50,000 square foot center.
They take a third of the items that they

[53:01]
They take a third of the items that they
get from the airlines and they just
throw them away cuz they're crap. They
take a third of them that they get from
the airlines and they then donate those
to charity. And then they take a third
and they resell it. So, it's like the
world's biggest flea market. It's not
even the right word. thrift store.
&gt;&gt; It's like government sanctioned theft,
&gt;&gt; dude. Like, it really is. And there's
there's only one licensed reseller in
the United States. It's a monopoly.
&gt;&gt; They have over a million people every
single year that come and shop at the
store, which is just nuts to me. There's
been stories of Rolexes, 40 karat
emerald being sold there, well below
retail value. And this part's nuts to
me. It's been around since 1970. Could
you imagine owning a monopoly for what
is that 60 years? No, 50 years at this
point. 55 years.
&gt;&gt; Do you know who owns this?
&gt;&gt; I looked into it a while ago and I've
been there before, but no, I don't know
who owns it.
&gt;&gt; I don't know who owns it either, but
it's it's a private.
&gt;&gt; When we were living in Alabama, we had
heard about it. We're like, "Dude, let's

[54:00]
heard about it. We're like, "Dude, let's
go to We It was like a Saturday. Let's
go. Let's go Unclaimed Package. Let's go
get some deals. Let's go check it out."
We go there and it was just a big
nothing burger. like really
&gt;&gt; from the business concept is amazing,
but it's not cheap. Like they can sell
stuff for whatever they want because
they have so much demand. It's such a,
&gt;&gt; you know, it's such a unique tourist
attraction. They have a captive audience
and it's like more expensive than a
thrift store. You go there thinking
you're going to get deals, but I I just
think they have so much demand. They
don't have to sell stuff at a discount.
&gt;&gt; I just looked it up. Founded in 1970 by
Doyle Owens. He used he used a borrowed
pickup truck and a modest 300 thou $300
loan to launch his venture purchasing
unclaimed luggage. And in 1995, his son
Brian Owens and wife Sharon purchased
the business. So they've just owned it
privately since 1995. It's nuts. So,
this got me thinking. What other
businesses could there be like this
where discarded, forgotten

[55:00]
where discarded, forgotten
assets, for lack of a better word, are
just left that you could resell? What
are some of the things that might look
like this?
&gt;&gt; Dude, it makes me think of my kids
school. I I go to my kids school and
near the end of every semester, you walk
in and they'll have this big display of
clothes and t It's basically 90% clothes
and tumblers. And it's like, "Come get
your crap. We're going to throw it away.
You can't tell me that every school in
America doesn't have that, right?
There's got to be something here like a
lost and found as a service or like
software that enables these schools to
better get rid of it or sell it or
donate it. Some sort of a system or
something where you can aggregate all
this stuff and liquidate it, sell it on
eBay, whatever.
&gt;&gt; I got something for you. You ready?
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; What do all the car rental companies do
with the crap that gets left?
&gt;&gt; Steal it. Surely it's
&gt;&gt; I mean, come on,
&gt;&gt; dude. If you're cleaning out a car and
you're paid $17 an hour, you find an
iPhone under the seat, you're not
putting that in your pocket. Come on.
&gt;&gt; No, but in all in all seriousness, it's

[56:02]
&gt;&gt; No, but in all in all seriousness, it's
it's going to be the same problem as
airlines, right? They're going to have
items that are left behind. I have no
idea, but that's that could potentially
be a business that is very similar to
this. Hotels, obviously, hotels are
going to be in a very similar situation,
right? Basically, anything around
travel, Airbnbs, maybe there's somebody
who owns a hundred Airbnbs that they
license out to a property management
company. You could get in touch with
some property management companies and
say like, "Hey, I'll buy any left behind
items off of you at a discount." Cuz
literally, what do they do with them?
They're, like you just said, they're
probably either throwing them in a box
or they're like, "Oh, maybe we could
sell this on eBay."
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But if somebody came to them and said,
&gt;&gt; system for that,
&gt;&gt; "I'll buy your junk from you at a
discount. Here's the cash." And then
they wipe their hands from it and they
go.
&gt;&gt; There's something there. Someone's going
to do something there.
&gt;&gt; They should. Anyways, I like that one.
&gt;&gt; It's a good one.
&gt;&gt; Did you see I think it was last week or
the week before Meta, parent company of
Facebook, came out with their quarterly
earnings.
&gt;&gt; No,
&gt;&gt; it came out and they freaking crushed

[57:02]
&gt;&gt; it came out and they freaking crushed
it. Like crushed it. Year-over-year.
Their ad revenue is up 21%.
Which is insane. Their ad impressions
are up 11% year-over-year.
&gt;&gt; The average price per ad that they're
making is up 9%. And their daily active
people, take a guess. I want you to
guess how many daily active people does
Facebook have
&gt;&gt; across Instagram and WhatsApp.
&gt;&gt; 2.5
billion.
&gt;&gt; Okay. 3.5
billion people.
&gt;&gt; That's crazy. It's like 50% of the world
is a daily active user, which is insane.
The thing in particular that that I was
just like most blown away by is the
impact that AI has had. What this says
here is with AI, Meta has been able to
boost their ad conversions
by 5%
on Instagram and 3% on Facebook. And

[58:01]
on Instagram and 3% on Facebook. And
they're only getting better because
they're using AI. And I just thought
that because they're getting so much
better, you're seeing it in their
quarterly performance, not because
they're using AI to like cut work force.
They're using AI to make their product
better. And if you're a small business
owner, you need to be using Facebook and
Instagram meta ads.
&gt;&gt; You're going to be more likely to use it
for the first time and or you're going
to increase your budget, your daily
budget.
&gt;&gt; I was just talking to a guy. He has a
business. It's a home services business.
I don't want to out him. And he was
like, "Yeah, I tried to use Meta. It
doesn't really work. But let's let's say
that it's a home services business that
washes windows. Okay, let's just say
that's the business. It's like, "Yeah, I
tried it. I had an ad agency doing it,
but it I didn't really see any results
from it." What would you say to somebody
like that?
&gt;&gt; Okay, this is maybe a terrible analogy
cuz I hate golf. But imagine someone's
like, "Oh, I I hate golf. I went out on
I went to a golf course with a club and
I I hit it and I sliced it, so golf
doesn't work." Like what
&gt;&gt; did anyone like did you ever take

[59:01]
&gt;&gt; did anyone like did you ever take
lessons? Like golf works for millions of
people. Like you sliced it once so you
don't like it so it doesn't work.
Therefore it's broken for everyone or
your whole industry. Like dude, you you
can't just write it off like that.
&gt;&gt; He was using an ad agency that was like,
"Oh, I had an ad agency that was doing
my meta ads, my Facebook ads." And I was
like, "How long did you do it for? Did
you like do you know how they were AB
testing it?" And and this is you know
me. I don't know jack about this stuff.
the stuff I know is basically picked up
secondhand from you. And he was like, I
don't really know. I mean, they tested
some stuff and I was like, were you in
the ad creative? Was it a video? Was it
a picture? Was it just text? Like, how
were you actually using it? And
obviously, he didn't have any answers
for me, but I've heard repeatedly over
and over and over, founder
Facebook ads are the best converting ads
to have somebody local who owns that
company and is advertising there. And
yet there's still they're still coming
like this guy owns a home services
business that washes windows. You're

[1:00:01]
business that washes windows. You're
telling me that people needing window
washing services aren't on Facebook.
They're not going to convert. Like it's
probably the best place that they're
going to be that you're going to have
conversion,
&gt;&gt; right?
&gt;&gt; Obviously, there are always going to be
different industries that are better for
Google versus Facebook or whatever. I
would say net of net like a home service
business is usually going to be better
on Google because it's higher intent
traffic. People are ready to buy right
then. But there are so many examples of
home services crushing it on Facebook.
You just have to do in the right way.
You need instant form leads. Like you
need videos, never pictures ever. You
need to be focused on planting seeds,
not on converting right away. Whereas
with Google, you want to convert right
then because they're hot right now.
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's interesting. You kind of
think of more as for home services
brands, Facebook as like a brand
building or brand awareness campaign
&gt;&gt; or retargeting. You put a pixel on your
window cleaning website and then people
find it from all over the internet and
then Facebook is going to like basically
put a little tracker on them for the end

[1:01:00]
put a little tracker on them for the end
of all time and then you can retarget
your ads to the people that have already
shown interest in your website. They've
already been on your website. So
retargeting campaigns are one of the
most effective campaigns because it's
it's high intent people that already
know and recognize you. But we need like
seven touches before we convert. Why do
you think it is so much harder for small
businesses, not harder, why do you think
it's so easy for them actually to say
like, h Facebook doesn't work? Are they
just not testing enough? Like what's the
threshold at which you actually can be
successful on Facebook?
&gt;&gt; They're probably just not desperate
enough. Like they have other customer
acquisition strategies that are working
fine and good is the enemy to great,
right? And so it's like they just don't
really need it enough. Whereas, if that
were the strategy that they started with
or the marketing channel that they
started with and really took the time to
learn it themselves, like I don't really
suggest people hire agencies before like
learning how to do it themsel. Like we
hire an agency to be the silver bullet,
but I like hiring agencies once I know
enough to hold them accountable and to
actually know if they're doing a good

[1:02:00]
actually know if they're doing a good
job or not. Because it sounds like this
guy didn't know what questions to ask
the agency to even discern that. I had a
buddy of mine I was just talking to
yesterday and we were talking about
something else, but he was like, "You
should hire an agency." He was talking
to me. He's like, "Hire an agency, but
tell them upfront, my goal is to fire
you in 3 months and I'd like you to loom
everything that you do for me so that I
can learn how to do it." And I was like,
"Dude, no agency is going to take you
on." He's like, "You're telling me an
agency is going to refuse $10,000 of
work just because you're being upfront
with them? They're probably going to
think, oh, that guy's not actually going
to do it." But at least you're being
upfront with them and you're you're like
accelerating the learning curve while
they're doing the work that you need
done anyways. And I I just thought that
was a really cool kind of approach to
it. And yes, there probably will be some
agencies that say no to you, but
&gt;&gt; I think you'll get more yeses than no.
Mhm.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. All right. What you think? Please
share it with a friend and we'll see you
next time on the Kerner
