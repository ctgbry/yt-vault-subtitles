I bought this Tesla Model S two years
ago I put 30,000 miles on it and here is
my brutally honest opinion of why you
should not or should own a Tesla number
one you're driving a car that's still in
beta and you are the test subject watch
out I bought it for full self-driving
cost 10 grand extra and it doesn't even
work buy beware real world range is
significantly less than advertised
mine's advertised for 390 I get 290 if
I'm lucky supercharging is 40 cents per
kilowatt hour um you'll pay extra if you
use Tesla insurance if you drive past
11: p.m. or if you have a bug with your
forward Collision warning it's a total
racket my tires wore out at 20,000 miles
it costs 2500 bucks it's a joke um it
beeps at you when you try to look at
your phone while you're full
self-driving what's the point of full
self-driving here's why you should buy
it very smooth fun to ride automatic air
suspension all glass roof is amazing
wide interior is amazing big screen is
amazing vegan leather whatever it is
it's amazing the yolk steering wheel not
that hard to use and I love it
