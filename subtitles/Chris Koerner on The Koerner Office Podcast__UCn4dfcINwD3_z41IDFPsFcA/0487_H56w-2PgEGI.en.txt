awesome but is there a business here day
15 of showing you 2025 is best business
idea so follow for more absolutely this
video has 38 million views that means
there's a business here why aren't you
starting it yet because I haven't told
you yet so listen and I will one of two
things you don't need triplets to
install something cool like this in your
house you need children most Americans
have children you can have a business
advertising this in local Facebook mom
nextd door groups and you can install
these for a little bit of money they
don't like them you pull it down it's
tiny little drywall path that fix it or
number two you can make a couple of
these yourself post them to social media
get some traction buy all the stuff
together put it in a kit and sell the
kit on Etsy or locally or
internationally on Shopify or Ebay
anywhere you want so people can install
it themselves opportunity is everywhere
anything can scale full business plan
