look at this freaking guy right here
this original video got 14 million views
and behind every viral video is a viral
product just begging to be sold here's
exactly how I would capitalize on a
product like this first of all you can
go to Alibaba today and buy these mini
Jeeps for $500 to $1,000 plus there are
American Import companies that can
manage all the logistics for you because
it can be a headache furthermore I have
a friend in Oklahoma that sells many
excavators like these for 10 grand and
he buys them for three grand you can do
the same thing with those but how do you
actually validate if this idea is any
good before spending a ton of money and
sending it to China I would go to
Facebook Marketplace i' go to Alibaba
first copy a ton of these pictures post
them for sale at Facebook Marketplace at
varying price points and varying markets
and measure how many clicks and Views
and messages you're getting from these
ads and then go buy the thing that's the
most popular and right now you should go
to the ker office on YouTube or podcast
and watch all of my videos because
that's all I do is discuss tactical
business ideas like these
