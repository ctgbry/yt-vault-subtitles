started a gutter cleaning business on
the side in late February what's the
best ways to find jobs and grow in the
early stages so this is a long-standing
question of any startup owner right how
do I get my first jobs in the early
stages and I think there's an
overarching principle here that people
are unwilling to acknowledge and that is
pride pride SL egoo is at the core of
everything we do or don't do whether
we're willing to admit that or not so if
I'm getting asked a question like this
about starting a gutter cleaning
business pressure washing home detailing
lawnmowing whatever it is these are all
things that our friends and family get
done on a regular basis which means that
our customers should not be hard to find
the hard part is putting our pride aside
to go ask them to go ask them hey can
you pay me to do this job for you but
there's an easy and a hard way of asking
people this awkward stuff I'm the king

[01:01]
people this awkward stuff I'm the king
of anti- awward I hate awkward I hate it
I hate it I hate it but there's a way to
do this right and so if I were this guy
with a gutter cleaning company I would
get my friends and family on the phone
one by one I would not text them and say
hey I just started this new business I
I'm just testing right now I just want
to see if I'm any good right I I want to
clean gutters I think this could be
something I could scale but I need some
testimonials would you allow me to clean
your gutters at half off 20% off 30% off
whatever and just get those first few
jobs and then once you have the jobs
they're going to love it this seems like
a very kind of binary outcome type
business they can't even see inside the
gutter so as far as they know you did a
great job then just ask for referrals
and I tweeted about this a while ago but
there's a guy I spoke to in Australia
that started what is now an $8 million
window washing company and he only
started with his friends and family
that's it and it just snowballed from
there word of mouth because every person

[02:00]
there word of mouth because every person
knows three to 400 other people and if
they're willing to give referrals to 1%
of those three to 400 other people then
every one of your 20 friends can refer
60 friends can refer 180 friends so on
and so forth right so the long-winded
answer to your question is put your
pride aside first because I'm betting
you're not here to you're not here to
clarify but I'm betting that you haven't
truly exhausted your circle friends and
family so do that first and then ask for
refer refal shamelessly ask for
referrals if you did a good job why
wouldn't you
