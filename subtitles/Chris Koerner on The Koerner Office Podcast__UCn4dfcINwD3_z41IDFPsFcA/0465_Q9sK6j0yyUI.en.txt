look at this freaking thing right here
here's why I love this business and
here's what it is this is day nine of
showing you my favorite 2025 business
idea so follow for more I love it
because every city has a farmers market
nearby where you could sell these things
at a huge markup I see them sold at my
Farmers Market all the time there's not
much regulation to it are the machines
expensive upfront yeah but you can put
it on a credit card if you're willing to
take that risk you can buy them used if
it doesn't work out and you can sell
them used hopefully at break even or
maybe at a small profit if you buy right
and it's fun you're selling candy this
is freeze-dried candy to be exact it is
blowing up around the world I made the
full business plan right here
