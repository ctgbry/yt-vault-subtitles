look at this freaking thing right here
this guy planted 500 tulip bulbs in his
yard in the fall and in the spring he
had 500 tulips so this got me thinking
could this be a good business idea of
course it could if people can charge
thousands to hang Christmas lights or to
decorate porches with pumpkin or to
decorate porches with Christmas stuff if
there's a business for all those things
I promise there's a business for
planting tulip bulbs in a yard who needs
a business for this you can just watch a
video and do it yourself no you don't
know what type of whola drill what type
of bulbs you need or how deep to plant
or where to plant them or how to plant
them or what the pH level of the soil
needs to be where to buy them at
wholesale I promise you could charge
money for this and people would pay for
it just like they'd pay for any
Landscaping service that makes their
yard look better full business plan here
