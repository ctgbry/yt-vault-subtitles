[00:00]
welcome to the ker office I wanted to do
something a little different today I
have a spreadsheet or a Google sheet
that is entitled every business I've
ever started and I had not added to this
for six 12 months and last night I
couldn't sleep and so I started adding
to it and I was at 40 when I started and
I finished at 70 and so I have started
over 70 businesses because I know
there's a handful more that I haven't
remembered but here's what I qualify as
a business I'm going to read every
single one of these and give you just a
quick primer on what it was and the
background so I count something as a
business if I thought it would generate
revenue and I spent hours on it maybe I
filed an LLC and then spent some time on
it maybe it was a full-fledged business
with employees Revenue raised money um
or maybe there was never an LLC it never
generated Revenue but it was a test
right I'm counting test as businesses
because every business I start starts as

[01:01]
because every business I start starts as
a test and so I just thought this was
really interesting to look at because I
get comments on Twitter all the time
that says wow how do you have all these
stories like sounds like you've lived
two lifetimes in 30 something years and
I think that's because I I've started 70
businesses and I've had 10 15 20 I know
I've said different numbers of how many
business partners I've had that's
because I count them differently so it's
kind of not a solid Target but I've
always had a few few tests few
businesses few companies going at the
same time which means that I have a ton
of experience in the 0o to1 phase and I
love it and it's absolutely my passion
if you can't tell by now so without
further Ado let's get started on these
businesses and I will tell you um either
the market cap or the revenue or some
sort of a metric that lets you
understand how big all of these
businesses are or were and most of them
had Zer dollars in Revenue because I
abandoned them and I'll also tell you
the outcome of all of them so my first

[02:00]
the outcome of all of them so my first
business was selling used golf balls as
a 9-year-old in Logan Utah I lived
across the street from the Logan River
golf course and I was kind of poor not
really poor but we just didn't have a
lot of money and I wanted to buy candy
at the grocery store down the street
Macy's and so uh I would go looking in
the ditch across the street Park Avenue
I think I lived at Park Avenue and I'd
look for golf balls and I'd wash them
and I had a Red Rider wagon and I would
wash them with um laund detergent make
them sparkly and white and I put up a
huge 4X 8T plywood sign I leaned it
against my mailbox it was a really busy
road got a lot of traffic and it just
said use golf balls three for a dollar
and then these guys in polo shirts would
pull into my driveway and give me a few
bucks for a few golf gos few golf balls
and it was really fun that was my first
taste of
Entrepreneurship then so I'm going to
jump around I don't have these in
sequential order uh when I was in
college I started a business called
textbook crook textbook crook was a

[03:01]
textbook crook textbook crook was a
Marketplace for college students to buy
and sell textbooks to each other because
I thought it was ridiculous that I'd
spend $130 on a textbook and then four
months later at the end of the semester
the bookstore would give me $15 for it
but I knew that another student about to
take that same class would give me $70
for it so some people did it on
Craigslist at the time there was no
Facebook Marketplace this was two so I
thought there should be a Marketplace
for this and so I found some template
online it was really ugly you can go to
web Arch and look up textbook cook.com
and you'll see it it was a really really
ugly website terribly ugly logo made in
Ms paint literally but I paid $500 for
this template it was a Marketplace
template and people could list their
textbooks for sale for
$1 and that's it I just made a dollar
per listing and I advertised by getting
postcards printed full color two-sided
postcards and me and my buddies um that
I worked with at a Thai restaurant
waiting tables um after our shift ended
at 2:00 we'd go to the Community College

[04:01]
at 2:00 we'd go to the Community College
Shelton State and we go to the
University of Alabama where we were and
we'd put these postcards uh under the
windshield wipers of all the cars and
that got us our first customers and then
one day Serendipity happened and I got
an email from the University some random
notification and they did not bccb they
emailed all 28,000 students just on
Gmail it was right there I had
everyone's email and so I slowly hit
reply all
and shamelessly said textbook cook.com
we're textbook crook because we steal
the competition and I I hit reply all
and I emailed every single student in
the University of Alabama because I
could and it's better to ask for
forgiveness than permission and that
drove a bunch of traffic to my website
and the IT department reached out and
they said you can't do that you should
never do that again and I said oops okay
sorry and you can't unring a bell what's
done was done and that was really good
for my business but then a few months
later I had my first son and the

[05:02]
later I had my first son and the
business wasn't showing a lot of
traction and so I abandoned it that's
what happened with textbook crook then I
had a business that lasted all of an
afternoon called clean cuts and this was
like I was 21 years old I was straight
out of my mission and I wanted to mow
Lawns to make some money in tuscalo
Alabama and so I printed up some flyers
Clean Cuts lawn care and I went to a
neighborhood I still remember the
neighborhood I took my kids there last
time we were in town for an Alabama game
and I started passing out flyers and I
got a job and then an hour into it I was
like this sucks I just remembered I hate
mowing the lawn I have always hated
mowing the lawn what am I doing there's
better ways to make money and so yeah
I'm calling that a business but really
it was an experiment that lasted an
afternoon my next business was CK
properties and that was me buying rail
homes and I started by buying my first
home uh in Tusc luus Alabama it was a

[06:00]
home uh in Tusc luus Alabama it was a
tiny 900t three-bedroom one bath
50-year-old home and we paid $90,000 for
it and then at the time President Obama
was giving $88,000 tax credits to
first-time home buyers to help spark the
economy out of a recession and so once I
got that $88,000 check I promptly put it
into a rental home five minutes down the
road from me in a rough part of town it
a four-bedroom two bath I paid about
$56,000 for it and CK properties was
born I was a landlord at age 22 and then
I bought a few more one in Huntsville U
another one in Huntsville and I own
those homes for three to six years I
started selling them off in the mid2 and
it was just too hard to manage single
family homes from a few states away
because I had moved to Texas in 24 then
I had a business I I consider this like
my first real business it was phone
restore and phone restore was a chain of
iPhone repair shops in my first location

[07:02]
iPhone repair shops in my first location
and I'll talk about a lot of these in
more depth on future episodes but I just
want to touch on these quickly phone
restore started when it was 2010 and guy
in one of my classes gave me a free
iPhone because it was broken and it's
sitting in his drawer and I had a palm
phone with a physical keyboard and then
I saw a flyer that said iix iPhones $60
and the guy's name was Samir I think
and he lived in the hounds tooth
apartments right on 15th Street and I
called him up and I said I have this
iPhone and the screen won't turn on he
said bring it over to my to my dorm room
so I went over there and he had already
ordered the LCD screen from eBay and I
sat there in his dorm room and watched
him fixed it and then I went to eBay and
saw that part was only $15 and he
charged me 60 and it took him 10 minutes
and I thought that's a good business
that's going to be my first business if
he can do it I can do it started doing
some research and learned that there was

[08:01]
some research and learned that there was
a business in Baton Rouge Louisiana
another sec school town called MyPhone
MD I used to be called iPhone MD but
Apple threatened to take them out sorry
I just got an interruption if we could
edit that out they were called MyPhone
MD and they used to be called iPhone MD
but Apple said hey you can't use the
word iPhone in your business name and
they were just bragging they had a
location and doing 20 30 40 Grand a
month fixing iPhones so I thought man if
they can do it there I can do this here
so I did a bunch of research and learned
that Tusa could support at least one
store so I signed a lease on one of the
best retail spots in town put a personal
guarantee on it 2500 bucks a month right
in between a Subway and a Batteries Plus
and I was Off to the Races and uh
tornado hit me and I opened a second
location to Birmingham and then I
graduated and then I opened a third
location in Huntsville and then we moved
to Huntsville and then I opened a fourth

[09:00]
to Huntsville and then I opened a fourth
location in Huntsville and then two
years later I sold the business and then
I had a dispute with my business
partners that lasted a couple years and
was very stressful and we ended up
settling and I got a a check I got a
sizable check in the mail for selling
that business it was a lot of money uh
for a 20-some year old not enough to
retire but enough to feel pretty rich
and that was my first real real business
and it was a lot of fun so then I
started LCD cycle which I started
literally the day after I sold phone
restore and LCD cycle was born when I
got a call one day I was sitting in the
store fixing an iPhone hating my life
working in retail which is the worst
thing ever and I got a call that said
hey I want to buy your iPhone screens
and I said why would you want to buy
those well we can recycle them we send
them to China and I hung up and
immediately thought I want to do that I
want to be in the other end of that
transaction and so I started reaching
out to vendors through Alibaba dming um
iPhone screen vendors and saying copy

[10:02]
iPhone screen vendors and saying copy
paste copy paste the same message saying
I want to buy iPhone screens and I want
to recycle iPhone screens can you help
me and about one in 10 would say yes I
can help you with both and everyone else
said I can only sell you screens I can't
help you recycle screens so then I just
started sending them my company's um
iPhone screens to see what would happen
and I had to learn how to import how to
export how to label your boxes to not
get confiscated in customs how to go
through Hong Kong how to do all this
stuff to get them there and then I had a
business and so I had set the groundwork
for this before I ever sold phone
restore and so when I sold phone restore
I thought man this will be a lot better
I like this a lot more I don't want to
deal with customers face to face I would
rather sell them stuff on the internet
so that's what LCD cycle was and it blew
up it was product Market fit it was
right place right time and it was a lot
of cold calls and I will have a whole
episode dedicated to LCD cycle and how
we grew fast in the future but the long

[11:02]
we grew fast in the future but the long
and short of it is we did 28 grand that
first month exactly twice 56 Grand the
second month in February 2013 and we did
Grand 140 something like that the third
month and we closed out the year over $2
million and then we doubled every year
for a while and it was a big business
and that was a lot of fun and it lasted
seven years give or take and then I had
a business so forget the timelines from
here on out because they're all murky
was doing bunch of things at the same
time and I can't even remember the years
so forget the timelines I'll I'll tell
you if I remember but I had a business
called presto cars with Nick HEI my
current business partner it was a
concierge car buying service and we I
mean shoot we sold a bunch of cars so
revenues were in the six figures but it
was a terrible business I don't like
cars I don't care about them I don't
like breaking down on the side of the
road in an old Mazda Miata it was not
fun and during this time I was still
doing LCD cycle which was doing great
and so I was just thinking like what are

[12:00]
and so I was just thinking like what are
you doing Chris like why are you why are
you selling these used cars when you
could just be doing LCD cycle so the
whole model was you tell us what car you
want we become a licensed dealer so we
can see what is coming up at all the
auctions uh Manheim and adessa those are
the two big ones and then we would go to
the auction and buy your car for you for
6 feet so you pay basically dealer rates
you pay a wholesale fee plus like a
finder fee to us and the whole model was
to you know go to one auction for 6
hours and buy cars for 10 to 20 people
and make 6 to 12 Grand in a day gross
profit but it didn't work out like that
you know people would back out uh the
car would break down something would be
missed in the inspection we couldn't get
it at their Target price there was a
million things that could go wrong in
that business and they did and I
probably ended up breaking even maybe
losing a couple Grand on like let's see
20 30 maybe 150 Grand in Revenue over
the course of a few months yeah decent

[13:00]
the course of a few months yeah decent
business not for me then I had a
business called nobs crypto and this is
the one that I started with McAfee that
I dedicated a whole episode to about a
month ago you can go I think it was
after episode five of the ker office
it's called what happened when I showed
up on John MC's door that was 20 2020 or
so give or take that was a wild ride um
we had a our token had a market cap in
the tens of millions but that doesn't
mean it's real money it's just funny
money crypto money but we had tens of
thousands of customers token holders
whatever you want to call them we also
had a community um with you like 5,000
in monthly Revenue something not super
sizable but that was a that was a very
fun story if nothing else then I had a
business called repeat leads where I
would do lead generation for anyone that
wanted to buy and scrape leads and I'm
actually going to reboot this at some
point in the future because it's good
business I had a company called Ready
MLS where we would send bulk uh
marketing to people that had a home

[14:01]
marketing to people that had a home
listed for sale I'm trying to remember
this correctly to people that had a home
listed for sale to encourage them to
basically circumvent a real estate agent
and list directly on the MLS for a flat
$100 fee I think that's what it was and
it was fully automated so you that's
what it was people would list their home
on Zillow wherever as a for sale by
owner and we would say Hey you get a lot
more eyeballs if this is listed by an
agent I understand you don't want to pay
an agent three or 6% so give us 99 bucks
and we'll list it for you and it was
fully automated so they pay the money
they upload pictures upload a
description and then it would go to the
MLS under our broker's license there
that business could still be very viable
today I don't even remember why we
abandoned it it was me and uh a partner
at the time then I had a random business
called all green Shades which was like
oh gez 20 where I bought an Instagram
account that had thousands of followers
I don't know 20 30 40,000 followers and
the whole theme name of the account was

[15:00]
the whole theme name of the account was
just posting green things all green
Shades that was the name of the account
I don't even know if it's still around
anymore I don't pay that much for it
maybe 500,000 2,000 bucks and I was
going to see if I could start an
e-commerce website selling or Drop
Shipping all green things to the
Instagram followers and in looking back
it was actually pretty stupid idea and I
didn't get very far with it I think I
posted like I tried to grow it
half-heartedly for a month or two maybe
resold the account maybe abandoned it I
might still own it I don't know I had a
on the topic of green I had another
business with two good friends and
partners Grant and Max called mellow
migraine and Grant is a good friend and
he's very smart he's an engineer and he
always has brilliant product ideas and
he said Chris I suffer from migraines
and I recently learned that wearing like
Green Tinted glasses will block out the
light that causes migraines so what if
we sell Green Tinted glasses as a cure

[16:01]
we sell Green Tinted glasses as a cure
or a remedy for migraines I love it so
we ordered a bunch from China we
imported them I think I still have some
behind me in one of these drawers and we
started selling them via Facebook ads
and we sold some and they worked and
then we abandoned it and I don't know
why that's going to be a story that you
hear a lot same Partners Grant and Max
brothers we started a company called
spot shave which was a razor like let's
say you you shave in the morning and you
missed a spot and then you get out there
you think oh crap how embarrassing I
missed a spot it was a razor that was in
the shape of a credit card that would
fit in your wallet so you would always
have a razor on you and I still own this
domain name and I still think it's a
good idea but Hardware is hard
developing products is hard and we had a
prototype and it worked okay but we lost
motivation lost steam never did anything
with it at another business with a
friend that lives about 10 minutes away
good friend called Leah hona home
builders and he was a home builder a
custom homebuilder he did it for years
and he's really good at it and it's
really really hard to find really good

[17:00]
really really hard to find really good
home builders and he's very honest and
people love him he's sincere and genuine
and he's a great guy and he made a great
business partner and so I thought hey
why don't you be the home builder I'll
be the marketing guy and let's go build
some Custom Homes probably the hardest
business you could do and so I I
remember I made this like 5,000-word
ebook that we we put out through
Facebook ads of like how to choose the
right custom home builder and it's
pretty good content I'm not going to lie
I should I should dig that up somewhere
and then we just started like basically
giving out a free info product to DFW
residents that might be on the home for
a custom home and then we would use
those leads to sell to and this one lost
team too um my friend business partner
was a very busy man he was a pastor in
our church and he didn't have a lot of
time and I didn't have a lot of time I
built out a website got some leads but
it just never went anywhere me and him
the same guy started the next business
which was called assistant realtor we
were way ahead ahead of the game this
this is basically virtual assistance for

[18:00]
this is basically virtual assistance for
real estate agents only and so they
would text us a need like hey I need
these pictures edited or I need a
description written for a home um can
you help me with that and we would
Outsource all of that to Virtual
assistance for a fee and I think we had
a couple different names of that
business at the time but it just yeah we
just abandoned it it was it was kind of
a low ticket item and it was working
with Realtors is hard and we just didn't
give it enough juice uh we had another
business him and I called Halo Maids
that one actually launched we we got
revenue I think we got revenue for all
these businesses except Leah owna home
builders because it's kind of hard to
sell a million-dollar custom home but
Halo Maids was a you know an Uber for
home cleaning and this is actually
really common now this was 20 was less
common at the time but we use this guy
named run who sells like a course on it
and we had a really clean looking
website and we bought shirts and we had
cleaners and our distribution model was

[19:00]
cleaners and our distribution model was
to go through real estate agents once
again you see a pattern there and they
would say hey I've got this home that
needs to be cleaned uh it's a new
listing and we would send our cleaners
there to clean it and it was a nightmare
like Presto cars it was just a terrible
business and I didn't like it at all um
and so we abandoned it we didn't sell it
we just shut it down we got I don't know
thousands of we did a bunch of jobs and
I think we had issues with 80% of the
jobs and I was always on the phone with
realtor saying oh there's a hair in the
sink there's a hair in the tub y y and
they didn't show up it was just it was
the worst and that's one of those
businesses there's a lot of businesses
where you have to hit scale to really
make it worth your while and to get to
scale is much more difficult than a lot
of other businesses so if you're like me
and you like going zero to one and
you're able to go zero to one very
quickly it's pretty easy to just pivot
because why wouldn't you you've seen
that the grass is greener and a lot of
times it is greener and you should go to
that grass and it it it's a saying that
people use tongue and cheek but yeah a

[20:01]
people use tongue and cheek but yeah a
lot of times you should chase that
squirrel or chase that rabbit and go try
something different cuz what you're
working on is not the highest and best
use of your time and opportunity cost is
very very expensive uh the next business
was me buying mobile home and RV parks
with a couple partners and that business
went really really well until it didn't
and we bought 25 Parks over the course
of 18 months with a handful of investors
and it went super well and our
investment thesis was sound and our
Parks were performing great and we were
finding these killer deals off Market
that were really good deals and they
still are today um but I had a dispute
with my partners and it ended very
abruptly very very unexpectedly and it
was a big trial in my life and it was
very very depressing for a while but I
learned a lot from it and I'm much
better for it today I'm still buying RV
and mobile home parks with other
partners and if had I not gone through

[21:00]
partners and if had I not gone through
that terrible terrible experience then I
would not be doing well buying RV and
mobile home parks today I I started my
whole Twitter account on the thesis that
people want to learn about mobile home
and RV Park investing and they were not
getting that information online and so I
filled that Gap and it brought investors
to my plate and I've been raising money
uh with them to find great deals that
they've been thrilled about so I don't
regret that for a second what I do
regret is partnering with someone that I
didn't thoroughly vet about that's where
I went wrong next business is mining
Syndicate and that I'm still running
today that is the first one that I've
talked about so far that is still going
today and this started in 20 after China
decided to ban Bitcoin mining and Nick
and I we saw a big opportunity to start
mining Bitcoin in America we thought it
would be heading this way and it it did
we were right but we needed to find a
facility to mine Bitcoin and to sell
Bitcoin miners out because anyone can
sell a minor but 80% of people that want

[22:01]
sell a minor but 80% of people that want
to buy a Bitcoin minor need a place to
put it because you just can't put them
in your house right you can but you
shouldn't and you can't and so it's
really hard to sell Bitcoin miners if
you don't have a place to plug them in
so we needed a facility and so we found
one on bis by cell sold by this guy
named Josh and he's a great guy and
we're Partners today and we bought it
from him he was not a business it was
not an LLC it was just a lease with
infrastructure on site we bought that
from him and we turned it into a
business business and we did 9.1 8.8
depending on accounts receivable we did
almost $10 million in our first 90 days
profitably and that was the most growth
I'd ever experienced in my life and it
happened at the same time as my daughter
needing a lung transplant and us moving
to Houston and Christmas and it was the
busiest October of my life the busiest
quarter of my life but it was it was
good and everything worked out and we
still have that business today and it's
growing it's doing well um so the next
business is I I consider this a business

[23:01]
business is I I consider this a business
in and of itself even though it's
technically not split shares and split
shares is basically a subsidiary of
mining Syndicate where we take these
Bitcoin Miners and We fractionalize them
on our own in-house proprietary software
that my brilliant brother-in-law Justin
built and it's pretty cool so if you
don't want to spend five grand on a
minor if you think that this mining
Syndicate thing might be a scam and you
want to kind of sample it before you try
it there's a lot of scams in that's our
our biggest competition is convincing
people we're not a scam so split shares
is a great way of doing that where
people instead of buying a $5,000 Miner
they can buy 1% of a miner for 50 bucks
and they can be mining immediately and
they can see Bitcoin in their dashboard
and they love it and almost everyone as
soon as they buy one share they come
back within an hour or two and buy more
because that was kind of their test to
make sure that we weren't a scam and
we're different because we post the
serial number of the minor the location
you can come visit it because

[24:00]
you can come visit it because
historically PE this has been called
Cloud mining which has been a scam like
90 plus% of cloud mining companies were
just Ponzi schemes literal scams and
there was no transparency in the serial
number or where is the minor can I see
it yeah it was just we take your money
and we buy Ferraris with it and so we
Tred to be different by changing
changing the game and it's worked out
great and so split shares is part of
mining Syndicate but I consider it
separate company anyways next one is
Texas snacks Texas snacks is our bies
business where we are the largest
reseller of bies products in the world
because bues does not sell their own
products online they only sell in store
and so I'll do a whole podcast about
this one day but long story short we
kind of brute forced our way into being
um Bucky's unofficial partner by
launching a website for them we run it
so they're not an official partner we
are not bies we are a third party that
we pay full retail for all Bucky
products and we mark them up and sell

[25:00]
products and we mark them up and sell
them on our store and we do mid seven
figures a year it's profitable it's
growing very predictably and I like this
business a lot because I don't have a
lot of predictability in my life when
you've got a dozen half a dozen
businesses there's a you see kind of a
normal distribution curve some are doing
well some are on fire some are doing
terribly at any given time and so it's
really nice to have a flagship stalwart
in the bunch that just grows every month
it just grows
and it's really nice to have that so my
next business is send eats and send eats
is the company that we had at the time
that we launched Texas snacks sendit was
a 3pl a thirdparty logistics company
which is a fancy way of saying that
other companies Outsource their
fulfillment and Logistics to us
specifically e-commerce order
fulfillment pick pack and ship we
launched this at the start of Co seeing
a need for more e-commerce fulfillment
our thesis was corre Direct in that
there was great demand for e-commerce

[26:01]
there was great demand for e-commerce
fulfillment we chose the name sendit
because we wanted to take these Regional
food providers that had this Regional
loyal fan bases and I'll do a whole
podcast on this one day about why we had
this thesis and how I helped my friends
Bread Company go online our thesis was
correct but it was a smaller Market than
we thought it was even if you have this
Regional food product that you love
you're probably not going to be willing
to pay an exorbitant amount to ship it
across the country
that's what we learned but we had a lot
of nonfood Brands as well e-commerce did
blow up during covid and everyone said
this is the new normal like why would
you buy your groceries in the store when
you can order them on instacart why
would you go to the store when you can
buy everything online well you it's
sometimes just more convenient and so
e-commerce went way up and then it
shrunk again kind of back down to normal
levels and we learned it's just a very
hard business that we don't like being
in and so we made the hard decision a
year ago to fire all of our fulfillment

[27:02]
year ago to fire all of our fulfillment
customers we had plenty we were growing
they liked us but it was just not
profitable it was super low margin so we
quit that side of the business and we
went all in on Texas snacks and it was
the best thing we could have ever done
the next business was called landlord
data and so I have a huge spreadsheet of
contact info for landlords I still have
it today I had it back then this was
about 4 years ago and we wanted a
business where we could sell leads
landlord leads cuz you can't really get
those anywhere believe it or not and
they're pretty valuable leads you could
sell mortgages to them you could sell
insurance to them home services you name
it they're very valuable people and so
we had a virtual assistant build us a
website I don't remember what the domain
name was but it was a place where people
could log in and pay per lead to get
contact information of landlords and we
launched we spent thousands of dollars
to build the site uh with a partner and

[28:01]
to build the site uh with a partner and
it just didn't go well it just didn't go
well at all our marketing channels
didn't work very well and we were trying
like three other things at the same time
and so we abandoned it and I still have
that data I still want to do something
with it one day maybe a conference or
something but I don't know the next
business is called quarter cows and this
started because at church I was asked to
give a class on entrepreneurship and
there was about a dozen of us in this
class class and we had to start a
business as part of this class and then
we had to come back every Sunday night
in person and we had some steps we had
to go through and we had to talk about
how everything is going and so this was
one of a 100 ideas that I have in a
spreadsheet somewhere and the idea is
basically to sell grass-fed beef on the
internet and butcher box pioneered this
and they've done very very well I wanted
to do it a little differently in that
you could buy a quarter of a cow on the
internet and it'd be cheaper per pound
and it's kind of a novelty people think
it's cool it's kind of a flex that and

[29:01]
it's cool it's kind of a flex that and
they would be grass-fed and believe it
or not the unit Economics work out quite
well for this so the whole plan is to go
through a farm and I'm in North Texas
there's a lot of Black Angus grass-fed
beef farms in the area to basically go
to them and pay $4 per pound for a
quarter of a cow that's all vacuum
sealed Frozen and everything and then
sell it for seven or 8 a pound uh
shipping included in like a big foam box
shipped overnight or two day via FedEx
and it's a good business I think it this
is could still be a good business
because in shipping food a lot of times
in fact most of the times it doesn't
make sense the shipping costs are just
too expensive but we're talking a
quarter cow see if I remember this it's
like 150 pounds maybe maybe 100 pounds
worth of food and $7 a pound it's a s or
$800 purchase price shipping's 50 bucks
you could eat that just include that in
the price they get quote free shipping
and you can still make a decent margin
call it a 40% gross margin not amazing

[30:03]
call it a 40% gross margin not amazing
if you're growing via paid ads but since
it's higher ticket um it's it's worth
having a lower gross margin if you have
higher ticket right like Boeing has a 2%
margin but they still make you know 10
1520 million profit when they sell a
plane until they break down and the
wheels fall off quite literally so I
like that business a lot I think I own
cter house still um but I really just
launched this as part of a as part of
this course and at the time I actually
had cows in my backyard where I'm
sitting today because I I live on three
acres and it was fully fenced and I
wanted grassfed be for my family anyway
and so it kind of good timing I wanted
to start this anyway not just because of
the group and so we got our cows
slaughtered funny story we had four cows
two Minis and then two large Black Angus
and I had to take the large black angus
to the the butcher about an hour away
and I brought my son
Brady with me who was like four three or

[31:01]
Brady with me who was like four three or
four at the time and I thought this
would be good you'll see you know how
where our food comes from and so we we
got this animal trailer and we had to
get the cows in this trailer which was
an ordeal okay I now know that you need
like a shoot and you need machinery and
tools to get a 900lb cow into an animal
trailer I didn't know that I didn't know
what I was doing I was a dumb farmer
right I was a dumb wannabe hipster
Millennial farmer the worst kind and so
I had this rope and I somehow got this
rope around the cow's neck and I was
like physically pulling it into the
trailer I think I used my truck to pull
it into the trailer I hope pet is not
listening but I tied the Rope around the
cow's neck and then I kind of snake the
Rope the trailer was like a cage right
it wasn't fully enclosed so I snaked the
Rope through the back of the trailer and
tied it to my truck and then I unhooked
the trailer from my truck and then drove
very slowly to slowly kind of walk this
800 lb this thing was huge by the way

[32:00]
800 lb this thing was huge by the way
it's 800 lb cow into my trailer and it
worked it took like three hours and it
was by myself and I had no tools this is
not normal you can't really you can't
really manhandle to and this trailer was
too small for him and it had like these
rickety floorboards that were really old
and kind of rotted out finally got him
in there got my son in the back of the
truck we started driving towards uh I
think it was Blue Bonnet Blue Bonnet
meat processing and we're driving on
this country road and this minivan
starts passing me like okay that's
aggressive Miss soccer mom and she pulls
up next to me on this country road and
looks at me and she's like frantically
waving ah ah and like pointing to my
trailer and I was like oh crap there's
no scenario in which this is not
something very bad so I just like waved
at her okay thank you and pulled over
and I looked back and I only see one cow
I'm like oh crap how did I lose a cow
like how did I possibly lose a cow out

[33:01]
like how did I possibly lose a cow out
of the back of my trailer so I walked
back there and the second cow was not
lost it was laying down and it had
punched its foot through one of those
rotten floorboards and it had been
dragging on the road okay one day this
there's I'm lucky that I'm never going
to run for president or even city
council because I hate politics and I
would never ever do that mark my words
on this podcast I'm never going to run
for president I remember when Mitt
Romney ran and his biggest drama was
that they went on a road trip as a
family when he was a young dad and they
put their family dog on the roof of
their station wagon because there was no
room for it now on the roof in like a
cage with the cage Point pointing
backwards but people freaked out okay so
cancel me I don't care this is what
happened Farm life is not glamorous
anyway I had been dragging my cow's foot
along the road for I don't know how long
I don't think it was that long because
there wasn't that much blood but there
was blood and I was like oh I was like I

[34:03]
was blood and I was like oh I was like I
I don't know what to do I don't like
blood I don't do blood and so I had to
get in that trailer with that big
dangerous beast and like grab his quad
and lift up his foot and like oh it was
so heavy because it was just laying on
it and then put it on a good
floorboard um and then keep driving and
I got it there to the the processing
facility and it was just kind of limping
but it walked in there and I I was like
hey I already got this one started for
you we already got some ground beef on
this that is my quarter cows story and
then we got all the meat and I had I
sold it like it sold very fast I didn't
ship it online I sold it to friends and
family here in the area one Facebook
post which told me there's a ton of
demand for good grass-fed locally
sourced beef this would be a really good
business for someone to start by the way
and it was such a logistically intense
business and I didn't like it and I
definitely didn't want to raise any more
cows in my backyard that's not how I was
going to scale anyway I was Outsource
into a farm I actually drove out to this
really nice farm and spent a day there

[35:01]
really nice farm and spent a day there
met with these guys we talked pricing I
just didn't I didn't want to do that
business so we are almost out of time
