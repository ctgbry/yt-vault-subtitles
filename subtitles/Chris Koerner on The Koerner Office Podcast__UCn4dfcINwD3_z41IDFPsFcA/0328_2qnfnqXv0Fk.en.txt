welcome to the ker office I wanted to do
something different today so I had this
video go pseudo viral of this
interesting Christmas decoration tower
that this Instagram influencer put on
her front porch and I thought any good
craft idea is a good business idea we'll
talk boring Logistics in the beginning
but at the end I'm going to show you
what you really want to know and that's
how to find customers so if I were going
to launch this business today here's
exactly all the tools I would use to
launch it so what you're getting is 15
years of Entrepreneurship experience 75
launch businesses and hopefully just a
few minutes number one we're going to go
at Home Depot and we're going to buy
resin ear Planters get a few different
types cuz you want to test different
shapes and sizes while you're at Home
Depot you're also going to buy some play
sand you don't want to mess with
concrete cuz it's way too heavy it's
never going to come out of that planter
and play sand will have the same result
which is to hold the dowel in place and
to prevent the N from falling over you
can reuse it every year you can move it
around in 5 gallon buckets super easy
then you're going to go to Uline
depending on where you live you might
have a Uline location near you so you

[01:00]
have a Uline location near you so you
don't have to pay for shipping but
usually even if you do have to pay for
shipping you're going to save a ton of
money on boxes don't buy boxes at Home
Depot or Lowe's or anywhere else for
that matter buy them from Uline you can
see how cheap they are from4 cents a box
depending on size up to a couple dollar
a box and these are huge boxes here I
mean 6x6 x 36 in much bigger than you'll
ever need a lot of these you can buy in
quantities of 10 15 or 25 sometimes 50
you're also going to buy some wooden Dow
rods at Lowe's or Home Dep Depot or
wherever you go to get everything else
but this is the easy stuff you could
figure this out on your own the hard
part about any business is getting your
first customers if you can get your
first one customer then getting your
next 10 is so much easier if you can get
10 customers then getting your next 100
and next 1,000 is even easier than that
because you need reviews you need
referrals you need proof of concept you
need traction you need sales you need
motivation all of those are solved by
getting your first few customers so I'm
going to focus on that at the end now I
don't know if you ever saw my porch
pumpkin interview with Heather Torres

[02:01]
pumpkin interview with Heather Torres
but if you go to my YouTube channel at
the Kerner office right here it's the
featured video on my channel because
Heather is a rock star and in 4 years
she built a porch pumpkin decoration
business from crazy idea that no one
thought was good to a million-- dooll
business with 40% net profit margins yes
in 4 months of work she can make
hundreds of thousands of dollars in net
profit but she doesn't decorate porches
for Christmas she wants to spend time
with her family so that's up to you so I
would watch this whole interview and
listen to a exactly what she did to find
her first few customers that first
season okay now you need to make some
samples and you need some before and
after pictures and some videos but you
don't want to spend a lot of money so go
to thumb Tac right here thumb Tac you
can look for a photographer that is
competing with other photographers in
your area for the lowest price so find a
photographer that has four plus star
reviews that has a good bit of traction
but it's not the most popular on
Thumbtack tell them exactly what you
want as you describe your project and
ask for a flat Co quote to get some

[03:00]
ask for a flat Co quote to get some
simple videos and before and after
pictures now get to work you got to
build these things build a few different
types put them on your front porch if
you're not proud of your front porch
then go to a friend or family member's
house put them on their front porch get
a bunch of media I don't care if you
have a following you don't need a
following you're going to take that
media and go to all the local Facebook
mom groups and Buy Sell Groups every
area has a local Facebook mom group
you're going to post these pictures in
the mom group just as if you're bragging
like hey what do you guys think is this
cute do you like this start to get some
feedback and I promise you inevitably
people will be commenting asking how'
you do that how' you do that it's like
well I used X Y and Z to do it but I'm
actually offering this as a service and
then strive to get them on the phone
because it's much easier to close them
in person or on the phone than it is
over DM or text what do you charge feel
it out you're going to start by charging
a little so you can get those first few
customers get that traction get the
testimonials make sure you're profitable
from the first order on but you're not
going to price yourself in the beginning
where you'll price yourself at the end
you're going to work towards that
especially as you get busier so call it
1 300 bucks and that's the price for

[04:01]
1 300 bucks and that's the price for
them to keep all the materials at the
end of the season but if they let you
take it back then give them a 10 or 15%
discount but also feel it out a little
bit because you might learn that either
a people don't want to give it back even
with a discount or B everyone's
expecting to give it back anyway so let
the feedback drive your decision-making
here because a lot of what I'm saying
about this particular Niche is based on
Theory I've never launched this business
and I'm very open about that I've
launched 75 other businesses many of
them in the Home Services Niche but
you're going to beay Paving new ground
here so let the feedback dictate what
your strategy is okay now back to
acquiring your first customers you're
also going to post on Facebook
Marketplace the pictures sell themselves
here make sure that your first piece of
media is a video because Facebook
Marketplace will prioritize those in the
algorithm but you want both pictures and
videos just make sure the first one is a
video and be careful with how you word
it because Facebook Marketplace does not
like people to list services on Facebook
Marketplace like this they only want
people to list products so be sure to

[05:00]
people to list products so be sure to
name it like Christmas decorations or
something but then like in the image
maybe use canva to put words over your
images that really sells the product and
then in the text description be more
vague about what you're offering because
if Facebook thinks you're just selling
decorations you're good to go but if
they think you're selling Interior
Design Services they might delete your
listing they're not going to ban your
account or anything like that they would
just delete your listing now go to
Instagram your personal Instagram
account whether you have 50 500 or 5
million followers just start posting in
what you're doing every year that goes
by Facebook and Instagram become more
and more algorithmically driven which
means it doesn't matter how many
followers you have if what you're
posting is interesting or eye-catching
or unique the algorithm will push it out
to people that are near you but don't
know you personally so don't sweat about
follower count start emulating what you
see in your feed from other people using
trending audio in the background or
trending filters and post the before and
after pictures you're not going to be
outright salesy posting prices and all
that just talk about this business that

[06:00]
that just talk about this business that
you're starting and how excited you are
about it and how you just got your first
customer build it in public people will
want to support you once you get your
first five customers ask them for a
review and ask them for referrals you
have to ask for referrals they're not
just going to come naturally now if you
really want to get creative on finding
customers you're going to go to use
outcraze cleaners Window Washers car
detailers anyone Christmas light
installers a lot of the landscape guys
are also Christmas light guys a lot of
the pressure washing guys are Christmas
light guys I promise you the Christmas
light guys are not going to be doing the
service but you could approach them you
could text them or call them and say hey
this is what I do here's a picture if
you mention me to one of your customers
I will give you $100 from every customer
I get you keep your customer keep all
your money from hanging Christmas lights
but just say hey I noticed that you
clearly care about decorating your house
for Christmas look at these pictures

[07:01]
for Christmas look at these pictures
would you like this done too and you can
do one of two things you can white label
the service or you can just have them
refer you if you were to White Label it
then the person you partner with would
quote the job for you based on what you
tell them to do so they'd say all right
let me look at your porch yeah it's
going to be about $400 we can get it
done in about a week and then they're
going to pay you $300 and you're just
going to come do it and you're just an
employee or a subcontractor as far as
the homeowner is concerned that happens
all the time that's white labeling or
just referral you say hey here here's so
and so here's her business card give her
a call tell them I sent you and then
they will interface with you directly
and you can just pay them a 100 of the
400 that you charge either one works but
this is a win-win for both parties
because these Christmas light guys or
the pressure washer are not about to
start offering this service so piggyback
anyway you're going to go to outs
scraper you're going to log in I already
have an account super easy to use I'm
not affiliated with these guys you're
going to go up here to Services by brand
