hey everyone welcome to Ker's Corner
episode 6 today honestly I think this
was our best one yet it was our first
time live streaming and it was our first
time with prepared questions beforehand
all I knew going into it was about one
or two lines about the generality of the
question and then they just kind of let
me have it and so we went over five
things today in this order the first one
was a landscaping Biz about a $3 million
company and the guy was asking should I
vertically integrate like what other
services should I add second guy was
like ping should I quit my job what
should I start which is a question I get
all the time and I think he really liked
my advice number three was a guy here in
DFW wanting to put bandit signs out
which are like those yard signs to help
grow his wife's cleaning business and I
gave him some advice there I'd actually
had a cleaning business in the past um
and then the fourth one was a guy that
wanted to he's a financial guy and he
wanted to start hiring some virtual
assistants to offer bookkeeping services
to to a very specific Niche so that was

[01:01]
to to a very specific Niche so that was
a fun one and then the last one which I
think is one of the best was a guy named
Ryan asking about a partnership that
he's about to start with a friend he
wants it to be 50-50 He had just read my
newsletter where I said don't do 50-50
Partnerships so I asked him a bunch of
specific questions about his partnership
and then gave him some very specific
tactical advice on what he should do in
his case so I hope you like this episode
today let me know if you do or if you
don't and we will see you next week
[Music]
Adam i'mna Adam in and he is going to
talk about home service vertical
integration Adam can you hear me yes I
can thanks for having me absolutely
thanks for coming I would love to hear
about your business and your
question yeah so couple parts to the
question I own a landscaping contracting
business and really we're focused on

[02:00]
business and really we're focused on
growth right now I took the company over
in June of 23 obviously trying to grow
the top line but really a strategy
question when it comes to uh verticals
and we're interested in investing in
verticals obviously they're Capital
intensive but I just wanted to get your
thoughts on vertical integration in in
Contracting would you recommend going
into different verticals like a nursery
or a landscape supply company
so let me ask you a few questions first
when you said you took this over did you
buy it or how what did that look like
that's right I started in LLC last year
and then just acquired a DBA from a
small business
owner so how many employees did this
business have when you bought it and are
you comfortable sharing Revenue I I
don't have to say the name of your
business or anything but no that's okay
uh I had 34 employees revenue of 3
million a year okay awesome our Revenue

[03:00]
million a year okay awesome our Revenue
goal for this year is four million okay
and I I have your site pulled up I'm
looking at your services what is like
the 8020 of your Revenue like where's
everything coming from and where do you
want everything to be coming from yeah
um it's almost like a
99% construction design build land State
Contractor and then uh small maintenance
portion small snow removal and that's an
area that we want to grow obviously for
more recurring Revenue but yeah
primarily we are fully construction
right now okay what's your average
ticket size average would probably be
around
100K okay and are you doing like
neighborhood entrances or mostly
residential or commercial schools most
mostly residential uh upscale uh
residential okay outdoor patios
fireplaces yeah hardcap Hardscape
softscape yep okay and do you have any
idea what the market landscape looks

[04:00]
idea what the market landscape looks
like no pun intended like how many
competitors you have like how much of
the market do you have in in like a
geographical radius that you're
comfortable traveling to I actually
don't know that Market info right now
working with actually working with some
students at a business school on a
project they have to get more of that
info but I haven't paid for the working
info okay first of all you don't pay for
it you could find out probably within an
hour or two the 8020 right it won't be
as extensive as what a team will do but
okay um I talk about this company so
much I they really need to pay me I get
nothing from talking about this compan
anyway but outs scraper is amazing it's
four bucks and you can figure out within
minutes how many competitors you have
and then you can back you can backend
into it with keywords like you could
only search for Hardscape or only search
for landscaping and then you could just
look at their website be like oh I know
this guy he doesn't actually do
hardscapes or oh I know this oh that
who's guy huh then you can yourself or

[05:02]
who's guy huh then you can yourself or
an employee or a VA can look at their
LinkedIn or their website how many
employees they have and I bet there's
like a an industry kind of average of
employees to revenue right like you seem
to be 100 Grand Revenue per employee or
so yeah yeah yeah so I would just assume
that similar and then say okay if this
is the whole Market if everyone in this
part of my state is having their needs
serviced with hardscaping then I own
let's call it 133% of the market right
if that numberers
83% then it's going to change my answer
because I'm going to tell you okay yeah
let's start doing some serious Market
Research into what other high margin
High ticket uh verticals you can expand
into but if it's 5% 20% then it's like
why not figure out how to do more of
what you're already doing to get more
customers CU yeah I would assume that if
you I know you want to lean into the

[06:00]
you I know you want to lean into the
recurring side but let's ignore that for
a minute if you want to lean into the
high margin stuff you're already doing
these $100,000 jobs I assume you want to
just the ideal is just to keep doing
that and just keep copy
paste absolutely looking at other
verticals as a way to grow kind of
assuming that it's getting harder to get
the same types of customers no I I
wouldn't say it's getting harder it's
more of just a curiosity entrepreneurial
type desire I certainly want to grow our
contracting business but I just wasn't
sure if maybe locking down a vertical
would create more cost savings on the
material side but also grow that
business I would think the cost savings
would be fairly
minimal I'll tell you the kind of the
thought process I had about six months
ago in our tree trimming business I was
having all kinds of shiny objects
syndrome regretting not looking at
fences regretting not looking at
paintings okay and then we had started

[07:00]
paintings okay and then we had started
raising money to franchise this concept
what's that what do you hear are those
ads no you don't hear ads you don't hear
ads for me I don't do ads I don't do ads
you know what I do I do beg you to like
And subscribe to this because that feeds
my ego and my insecurities and then we
had started raising money to franchisees
concept because there was only one
Nationwide franchisor and we thought
let's compete against him and then one
day I hopped on outs scraper and I ran a
search for all of DFW and it was a
little it was a little tedious because I
had to put all the ZIP codes in there
took about an hour and I wanted to know
how many competitors do I have in DFW
assuming that I can Market better than
they can and so more competitors equals
good because that's more market share to
steal and so I found out there's 950
tree tripping businesses in DFW just
listed on Google Maps which is like one
in 9,000 residents which blew my mind

[08:00]
in 9,000 residents which blew my mind
way more than I would have thought and
then I back of the napkin math thought
okay some of these are they have
full-time jobs this is 50,000 a year
some of them it's a couple hundred
thousand a year it's a normal
distribution curve there's probably a
few eight figure companies maybe one
nine figure commercial tree triy company
and then a bunch of low six figures and
so even at that math it's a half a
billion dollar with a B market just in
DFW and then I I actually paid for a
report report that kind of showed me the
industry of tree trimming in Nationwide
and it was like 26 billion or something
and when I took the population of DFW
and divided by the country it was like
right at 500 million and so it two
different data sources telling me wow
this is a half a billion industry just
in DFW so then I thought okay like why
am I going to raise a million bucks and
franchise and sell franchises and get
legal documents that are hundreds of

[09:00]
legal documents that are hundreds of
pages in every state and go through all
this headache when I could be aund
million do business in DFW and only have
20% of the market so that hour I spent
researching completely changed the
trajectory of our company and now we're
just going deep it's still tree trimming
it's only DFW we were going to open in
Utah we're going to open Alabama we
canceled all that we're just going to
keep stealing market share yeah no it's
that makes a lot of sense so thank you
yeah yeah so I would do that and then
see what you come up with awesome thanks
so much no problem have a good day all
right you too yes I'm here how are you
Chris can you hear me okay Mike yeah
hear you great how are you I've been
doing well how about yourself I'm great
love that let me see here your question
was about which business to pick that's
my note why don't you add some more
context to that sure if it might be
easier to understand where I'm coming
from if I start with just a hair in my
background did a venture back startup I

[10:01]
background did a venture back startup I
went that route several years ago and
it's one of those things that went uh
really well until it didn't learned a
lot but uh timately was not a financial
success J thing and I was consumer
facing physical product and since I I've
been uh getting back on my feet for the
last couple of years um now working as
an engineering manager and um for
context I've been renovating a house
I've been living in kind of at the same
time as a former entrepreneur I
certainly want to get back out out there
been reading a lot of the content that
you and others like you put out reading
uh a lot of great ideas a lot of
inspiring stuff but I'm right now I'm
suffering from analysis paralysis big
time and I can see it I can feel it so
where I'm at now is at a a pretty good
W2 job I wouldn't call know extreme or
great or anything I'm sure a lot of
people would probably be happy with it
though and there's just so many good
options right now and it's hard with the
full-time job to really explore every
one of them fully test them out so that
I could know for sure okay that's where

[11:01]
I could know for sure okay that's where
I need to dive in um and that's the
basis for my question uh there's all
these different what I'll call for right
now verticals whether it's PE the W2 and
you know do an Ecom business on the side
or something uh to start a something
from scratch that's in maybe Home
Services maybe go the the franchising
route do I buy a small or medium
business do I buy something you know I
work in engineering I do a lot of
manufacturing do I buy more a factory
and even within service like you were
saying there's so many different great
verticals flooring Roofing Building
Homes um Landscaping way too large of a
landscape to get options and we just I'm
sure I'm not the only one in this
position just wondering if you have any
advice for someone like me who is uh
currently suffering from this kind of
analysis paralysis absolutely let me ask
you this are you the type to normally
suffer from analysis paralysis is that
kind of your persona that's a great
question I really thought about it that
way over engineering or is this just
such a big leap

[12:00]
such a big leap
I think this is such a big leap because
when other things in my life my career
usually there's not as many options it's
easier for me to just hit the direction
and go so I wouldn't say this is typical
for my personality there's just so many
good options yeah and do you like your
job and do you mind if I ask how old you
are sure I am uh 33 and I would say I I
like my job I don't love it but I like
it okay wife kids not quite yet okay
soon
that that's that's on the that's a goal
then absolutely okay do you like Home
Services specifically or are you just
coming across a lot of content so you're
naturally gravitating towards that I
think it's both I think the way my my
Frame Works that things I enjoy doing
renovating my house in my free time I
found I'm good at some of those things
my dad has worked in that area in the
past as well I think that combined with
all the there's a lot of content on that
on Twitter right now that's why I'm
looking at that avue and you would you

[13:00]
looking at that avue and you would you
consider yourself good at sales and good
with people I'm good with people good I
haven't worked like in sales but I found
myself my personality I can convince
people of things or I think I could be
good at sales but I know I'm not good at
least currently is like marketing and
product marketing something I want to
get better at I know I'm not I'm more of
an engineer than a marketer right now I
know what would you say your superpower
is what makes you completely exceptional
what makes me completely exceptional is
uh my ability to I am very good at a lot
of different things I'm not a de World
expert in any one thing but I am I'd say
confident enough in a lot so many
different things that I can put it all
together and move an organization in a
direction nice okay it sounds like
sounds like myself a generalist not
super good at
anything that's why to be CHR love it
all right on a scale of 1 to 10 how much
like fire passion enjoyment do you get

[14:02]
like fire passion enjoyment do you get
from your
W2 six six okay you don't hate it
doesn't excite you pays the bills it's
good for now
exactly how long have you been looking
around thinking about this seriously and
how much money do you have to invest in
something call it 2ish years now and a
lot of that other free time I haven't
been purely analyzing I've got an Amazon
store I've just opened up one on Tik Tok
I've been trying that route first I
haven't obviously I haven't quit the job
and bought a business or anything yet
and sorry what was the second part of
that question how much money do you have
to invest in a business either starting
or buying is that assuming I would cash
out any kind of taxel accounts I have
just amount of money that you're
comfortable putting in a business call a
couple hundred grand more if I needed to
have you ever managed people yes I
manage a lot of people right now and

[15:02]
manage a lot of people right now and
okay how are your performance reviews
like for me personally are the people
that work for me you personally they're
always great okay so your superiors see
you as a good manager and you see
yourself as one yes okay all right so
you're 33 you've got a couple hundred
grand you want to do this you've tasted
this lifestyle before right you had the
Venture back startup which was probably
a hybrid between corporate and otherwise
because I assume the investors put some
pressure on you they had some say or no
they they did not as much on a
day-to-day but on the you know general
direction of things and I was thought it
was a good thing it's uh we had good
investors they were helpful okay so I
don't think it's like analysis paralysis
I hear that word on a daily basis and I
find that more of a signal than a red
flag and what I mean is it's just it's
this is going to sound like the most woo
thing I've ever said it's The Universe

[16:01]
thing I've ever said it's The Universe
telling you that it's you haven't found
the thing yet okay right and that
directly contradicts things I've said in
the past and I say that very knowingly
but if you're 33 you've got money you
don't have a family yet there should on
paper there's nothing holding you back
from quitting your job and starting
something and so I feel like you're like
you're actually going to do this whereas
a lot of times I talk to people that say
all the same things maybe they're little
older and I don't know what it is about
them but I don't feel like they ever
will they're just playing business right
right they're playing house but you've
already done this and you've tasted that
and sounds like it wasn't the best exit
which means that you've seen the
downside of this already I sure have
only upside especially in if you were to
start something from scratch in Home
Services there's very little downside to
doing that assuming you get good
insurance so what I think the downside
for me on that is more opportunity cost

[17:00]
for me on that is more opportunity cost
of keeping the the easy to my
f okay so this is my next question is
how many hours if you're being
completely honest with yourself would
you say you commit to your job your
actual W2 per week it's it's ly some
weeks where say I'm traveling or
something it's it can be including a
travel time easily 60 out 80 maybe a
little more other weeks it could be as
low as 25 30
okay it's been lumpy and my kind of
analysis or the things I do kind of goes
in SPS okay so safe to say 40 is pretty
pretty accurate as an average but it's
lumpy yeah okay so you don't have to
quit like there's have you heard of the
wing Walkers code you ever heard of that
phrase no so if you picture those guys
that walk along the wing of like a
flying aircraft they never let go of a
railing until they're already holding on

[18:01]
railing until they're already holding on
to the next railing so I absolutely
encourage you to quit your job once you
feel like whatever you're holding on to
has the potential to replace your income
at least it doesn't have to already be
replacing it but has the potential and
that's basically any business like I
can't think of any business that can't
scale anything can scale to six figures
especially in this internet connected
economy I I like that you like home
service because I'm a huge proponent of
that there's probably hundreds of
opportunities out there that you didn't
even know existed right and so I'm going
to do something a little untraditional
and encourage you to keep researching
but also to encourage you to put some
money into something and what I mean by
that is for instance go buy a bounce
house or something okay something that
seems silly and can't scale but just
something that you could resell a break

[19:00]
something that you could resell a break
even or a small loss if it doesn't go
well and just throw up a website 10 20
bucks and just get a taste of some
internet money and just see how that
goes and do it long enough to have some
headaches to where you rent out a bounce
house and it goes flat and the mom's
pissed and you need to she's threatening
a one star review like you just got to
taste that side of it because if you
quit after you're only tasting the good
then you've got a very inaccurate and
bad sample size on your right right but
don't try to pick something that's going
to be the thing pick something that
costs 100 to $5,000 for your pot commit
and it's a thing it doesn't have to be
the thing but it's getting your feet wet
without quitting your job and getting
some income in the door hopefully and
just giving you a taste of that and then
you're going to be shocked at how many
different ideas that that getting in the
game gives you right it's your hand
handcuffed right now sitting at a W2

[20:01]
handcuffed right now sitting at a W2
thinking of ideas it's you're only using
10% of your business brain whereas
absolutely when you throw that bounce
house in the back of the truck and start
driving you're going to be thinking
about the job you're G about the job
you're about to go do you're going to be
thinking about your Facebook ad about
this and that and it's just going to
unlock this world of other opportunities
that will likely be nothing like the
boun house business for instance or
whatever you're doing in that what do
you think about that I love that I think
that makes per sense it's actually one
of the things I've been considering is
whether it's a bounce house or a little
skid steer or running out of dumpster or
a dump trailer whatever it is so it's
something i' consider so I'm glad to see
glad to see the push in that kind of a
direction yeah and maybe it's just
recency bias we just spoke to Ryan and
he's doing the The Wedding trailer uh
business I've done that business like
I've done the I love the rental business
because you start with one thing and if
it does not go well like you buy stump
grinder and then you put a add on
Facebook Marketplace they're they're too

[21:00]
Facebook Marketplace they're they're too
Grand you can get them used and you go
grind some stumps yourself and then it's
huh this is actually really fun I I like
cutting down trees I don't with my tree
shrooming business but at home like it's
a it's I'm a man right I like starting
fires that's why I want to own a
barbecue business so I could smoke
barbecue all day but do something like
that where because let's say you you
rent a stump grinder or you buy a stump
grinder you go do a job and then you're
like okay there's only so many jobs
direct to consumer that I can do but
what if I start reaching out to tree
triing businesses that Outsource their
stump grinding huh then one contact can
bring me five jobs a week instead of
Karen in the house bringing me one job
every five years it'll just get your
brain going so that's what I would do
awesome this is great advice I
appreciate it Chris absolutely hopefully
I'll call back in six months with the
problem with that business I hope you do
we we'll have a follow-up call okay
thank you sir I appreciate your time all
right thanks thank you
how's it going Chris AR good how are you

[22:01]
how's it going Chris AR good how are you
man I'm good man thanks for taking yeah
absolutely are you here in DFW I am in
the DFW okay and you have a question
about bandit signs I do so I started a
home cleaning business originally
started it for my wife she was dealing
with some health issues but she still
wanted to be active and contribute to
producing I'm working the 9 to5 thing
and I have a background in marketing for
the most part she got trained up on that
and then I said I'll take care of the
marketing piece I'll do the SEO for you
things like that but it's been a
challenge for her so now I'm like okay
I'm gonna have to try to step in and
maybe even end up taking over the thing
if we're going to keep it going and I
spent a lot of time watching guys talk
about their cleaning businesses and
their home services businesses one of
the things that I haven't really gotten
anyone to give me a good answer on is
how do they manage the bandit signs
piece because some of them are like oh
call you your municipality or whatever
the case may be and see and everybody I
called they're like no we got sign you
you know through the nose if you do that

[23:01]
you know through the nose if you do that
but I then continually see people saying
bandit signs I'm killing it with Bandit
sign blah blah blah so I was just like
you know what Chris has the the pulse on
businesses let me see if he has an
answer to this or if it's just what
everybody's the municipalities are
actually saying yeah I saw a bandit
signed tweet like two days ago you
probably saw the same one maybe now are
are you willing to say like what
municipalities you're looking at
specifically so I'm on the south side of
thef waxa haty the close and Mansfield
around there and I reached out to a
field and they were all like no can't do
that we're g to come get you I'm gonna
find you and then everybody's oh get
yourself a call rail number or whatever
the case may be and I'm like yeah if
they're looking for you they're going to
find you like I said we're bu strapping
things and I'm like I would like to do
this I don't have a problem putting in
The Sweat Equity Health cost of K Us in
regards to running paid ads and things
of that nature so I'm blue strapping it
would just what equity in free time that
I have and I'm like I don't want to put
myself at risk of getting hit up with a

[24:01]
myself at risk of getting hit up with a
bunch of signs if I fines if I have a
bunch of signs out there and whatever I
forget to pick one up in the morning
before cops come around or whatever the
case may be I may be overthinking it but
I figured it'd be nice to about to off
somewh and this is for the cleaning
business for your wife's business yes
we're doing a residential cleaning
business which funny enough we're
getting more retail science then we are
actually getting residential so now
that's also another thing that's got me
thinking should I just focus on
Commercial thinging instead so yeah re
like just a retail store yeah like we
get I'm assuming that these are guys who
are some of them have actually been in
Florida and they're just calling me up
out of the blue and they're like hey can
you do this job for us and I'm like yeah
we can do that and we've gone out and
we've got a bunch of retail locations
like thiss and then it's been like a
chain of people just calling us from
different states saying hey have do some
customers in your area can you take care
of this I them turn them down because
they trying to build it up yeah so this
is a remote cleaning business then yes

[25:00]
is a remote cleaning business then yes
okay and did you get into this by buying
like a course or some program yes
originally it was Rohan Gils saw him
about three years ago and then when we
started dealing with this health issue
and it was been it's taxed our our
finances greatly and so I said you know
what you're home you're dealing with
this thing how about you take this
course and she really enjoyed it and I
was like let's do it you don't have to
really be out there at a 9 to5 or
anything like that and talking on the
phone with people that's not that hard
so that's how it all started and she
likes it something that she wants to
scale she does she has the interest we
have three boys in dentistry school and
as you can imagine that's py and so the
idea being we would eventually really
like to be closer to them and this in
its full fruition would give us the
ability to do that but we're not there
yet do you see a path to to this
providing enough income even if bandit
signs never work out do you can you you
see that do you have a a plan for that

[26:01]
see that do you have a a plan for that
yes I'm not I'm not I've done enough
businesses in the past that I'm not on
the whole I'm G to do this at six months
train anymore so I'm look if we're going
to do this so it be 10 years to 10
million that's how it so I'm committed
to see it through this is just something
that there a lot of stuff I understand a
lot of stuff I know it's going to take
the buildup but part of it was like this
is the one question I can't get asked
answered and this is the thing that I
don't really know whether or not it's
even worth my time so I was like here's
a here's an entrepreneur that's on a
higher level than I am let me ask him
okay so you who's going to be placing
these bandit signs if they're going to
be all over the country it would be me
and my nephew for the most part going
out there you're trying to put them up
in DFW specifically yes for the most
part in South DFW just in the area where
we're located maybe a little about 30 to
40 minutes out is my is my kind of
distance limit and what is your churn
like
what is my what like how what percentage

[27:01]
what is my what like how what percentage
of your customers are
recurring so far we're not having a lot
of luck with the recurring customers
it's been low and things like I said
things have been slow because of the 95
and all the other stuff that's going on
it's mostly evenings when I'm hitting
this okay so let's just say
theoretically you were to put out a
bandit sign they cost a couple bucks
plus your time and it brings in a
customer that customer is going to have
a $200 cleaning and you're going to make
half that or so give or take yes okay
but then they're probably not going to
renew I would say the my understanding
is that your first year out you're going
to get about 20% recurring and then as
the years go forward it starts to double
from there okay all right so two pieces
of advice first of all I I know Rohan
Gils I didn't he have a launch 48 or
launch 28 isn't that the name of it or
was it I think it was launch 27 yeah
that's it so I did I did that years ago
started yeah I started it's so funny

[28:01]
started yeah I started it's so funny
because I get all these random questions
and so many times it's oh not only do I
know about that but I've started that
one yeah I've started that and all of
these ideas work if you like go all in
and want to go all in I did not go all
in it was called Halo maids and I did
not go all in because I just I hated
that business it was so ticky tacky like
I'll just never forget that Realtor
cussing me out because there was a hair
on the sink and and I was just like what
am I doing there are other ways to make
money so it's just that's my it's not
advice yet but I know that program I
know it's a good program it really is he
gives you like it sounds and I think
there's like dozens of those at this
point I think you got the best one so I
think you you got a good foundation as
far as bandit signs go I've never been
fined for a bandit sign um really you
don't never we've put them out we don't
put them out actively right now because
we found more efficient ways which I'm
happy to talk about yeah back when we
did like you just got to put them

[29:01]
did like you just got to put them
everywhere and I know that makes you
nervous but okay calling a city like I
just I have no good stories about ever
calling this they're usually calling me
about um okay but I I'm sure they I'm
sure they find people I'm sure it's been
done I don't know waxah hatchee um so I
don't want to be flippant about it but
yeah I'm not familiar with that
happening I'm not surprised they told
you that they would find you I'd be
surprised if they did do you know what
the cost would be
I think it's 500 for sign oh jeez okay
that's why I'm concerned but you're
saying that it's never happen so that's
I've never done in waxahachi or Midian
or any of those I'm talking Allen I see
I'm everywhere so I'm like how is this
working everybody's saying this works
and then the places they're like no
we're going to fight in death and I'm
like I see signs everywhere I go how's
this work you know yeah two things as
well as anyone a lot of people are just
probably bsing it and some people are
just they're in a complete completely
different city but I will say you can

[30:01]
different city but I will say you can
have better luck with bandit signs in
the more rural areas because they don't
care okay I my friend when I first
started my friend help when I first
helped my friend start his tree trimming
business six years ago we did bandit
signs and to this day I drive around
Allen which is 100,000 people and I see
his signs all over wow and it works and
he's told me that was like his number
one lead Source the sample size of one
we don't do it because we like our
primary lead source is texting realtors
for referrals okay I I think you should
try that as well I think you should
scrape a database of
Realtors searchbug.com
and search bug will tell you which
phones are cell phones which phones are
landlines and then you can use a tool
like porterhouse that's like a a
personalized SMS tool that's fully
compliant and it will even send them in
with blue bubbles it looks like it's
coming from an iPhone nice and you just

[31:01]
coming from an iPhone nice and you just
if you're willing to play the long game
which I'm glad you said that because
like just because the home cleaning
business didn't work for me doesn't mean
it doesn't work it works for I was not I
wasn't willing to play the long game you
could start a trickle of referrals from
Realtors like Realtors are touching
different homes all day every day and
they are always in need of cleanings and
they're always in need of people that
are reliable contractors on one so my
first piece of advice advice is try more
rural areas for the bandit signs that
just don't care about stuff like this or
try areas where you're already seeing
bandit signs because they're probably
not getting fined spend a couple hours
driving around my second piece of advice
is start looking seriously at different
acquisition sources for your leads
specifically property managers landlords
and real estate agents because like if a
realtor isn't recurring then they will
bring you recurring business because
they're always touching different homes
yeah I've been coold calling property
managers for about a month now and last

[32:00]
managers for about a month now and last
week I just started a cold email
campaign to Realtors yeah yeah cold
emails works both realtor texting works
better and calling they always answer
their phone no text yeah I appr you say
that before thank you so much Chris I
appreciate it man absolutely best of
luck to you good talking to you thanks B
you too what's up blin yep let's do it
oh perfect hello hey you might need to
close your other tabs I'm getting a
popup that says if you have Riverside
open in two Tabs go ahead and close it
or Twitter or whatever you have yeah I
have all that open I was watching the
episode on Twitter okay is it better
thanks for joining yeah it's perfect
awesome man hey let me get situated here
appreciate you doing these super super
helpful I watched the whole episode and
it's all been obviously pretty great
stuff I had a little bit of an
interesting question so I worked in my
father-in-law sign company and he
brought me on I was a teacher a science
teacher over at Lovejoy over in your
area yeah yep that's very familiar to me

[33:02]
area yeah yep that's very familiar to me
right so we I got out of that when I met
my wife and obviously he owns a sign
company over here in like Sagen teller
area and so I did some financing stuff
some like strategy stuff for him and so
I'm QuickBooks like certified Pro
advisor or whatever to do bookkeeping so
I'm watching my first million one day
and they have sayet on who did all the
WordPress stuff yep and man this like
labor
Arbitrage play for specifically they're
doing it for like web design but he was
like I like bookkeeping for the Tam and
then he said specifically reaching out
to CPAs is like white labeling your
service so if they don't offer
bookkeeping then you can offer my
service with a markup right and it got
my wheels turning about bookkeeping as a
service and all of that so I I have a
couple of questions I guess my first one
is labor arbit charge cuz I was thinking
go to Shephard get somebody that's good

[34:02]
go to Shephard get somebody that's good
they can manage I don't know 30 accounts
just doing filing the transactions
printing the reports at the end of the
month blah blah blah and then I could
just scale it like that and maybe do
email marketing to these smaller CPAs
and just go to town so that kind of
Labor Arbitrage model do you have
initial thoughts on that and then I'll
dive into the other stuff yeah so you're
saying you already have like a CPA brain
right you're QuickBook certified you
know the world you don't necessarily
want to do it yourself but you speak the
language right I'm not a CPA but like I
I did that or my father-in-law yes okay
and you like the business and it's
something that you would enjoy working
in that industry absolutely for sure
okay yeah I yeah from based on
everything you've said so far it's labor
Arbitrage everything Sayad said on the
podcast to in total agreement with you
okay great perfect and then so I guess
now my question is like getting somebody

[35:02]
now my question is like getting somebody
from Shephard and then what would you do
to initially get customers should I do
Outreach to myself to small business
owners I guess the main question I have
is I love this idea of a vertical Niche
like specialty think like dentist right
so I do SE Ser SEO Services only for
dentist and I'm just the best at it is
in this realm is that necessary like to
get like is there something that you
gain by categorizing transactions for a
dentist as opposed to an electrician do
you even think that's necessary
specifically in bookkeeping and then if
so should I go down that path I do think
it's necessary because bookkeeping is
such a commodity and What Makes You
Different right and so I think you
should go even more Niche than dentistry
and find something completely random and
off-the-wall bookkeeping for gutter
cleaners bookkeeping for fencing repair
companies and just test them and just
plug and play whatever industry that you

[36:02]
plug and play whatever industry that you
comes to the top of your head and see
what resonates they like there's no
Market too small in bookkeeping there's
32 million small businesses in America
they all need a bookkeeper in fact most
of them probably don't even have one and
so yeah I would definitely go Niche and
as far as how to find someone to do the
actual fulfillment I would just use upw
work honestly it's simple enough that we
don't even get that it's so simple you
find someone like don't look for an
agency on upwork look for an individual
on upwork and it will tell you in their
profile if they're an agency or an
individual and just find someone that
has availability and a ton of five star
reviews and that's very responsive and
if those three things match ton of
availability good reviews hyper
responsive then the chance of them being
a killer bookkeeper is like 80% I had
this conversation just yesterday with
Nick about one of our businesses we're
like all right we need a bookkeeper what
do we do and we're like just a A

[37:00]
do we do and we're like just a A
specialized role and and it was like I
have of all the things I've hired help
for
overseas I've had the best luck with
bookkeepers um I don't think I've ever
hired a bad bookkeeper overseas and
they've all been from upward okay so
when when we think about scale yeah so I
I guess do you think just put it up on I
don't know card or something and say
bookkeeping for whatever outs scrape all
of those people and then just see if it
works and if I get if there's 500 fence
companies in DFW then you know just hit
all of them and see what's up or I think
you should hire another virtual
assistant from upwork to do the cold
calling I you should do cold calling
specifically yeah I think you should yes
do outs scraper find out which ones are
cell phones that's probably going to be
a one to Fan show and have the VA just
make cold calls and it's just a very
clean offer it's just you're just
playing a numbers game we offer
bookkeeping maybe even think about a

[38:01]
bookkeeping maybe even think about a
flat fee it's listen here's our value
prop we offer bookkeeping for gutter
clean gutter cleaning companies it's
$400 a month that's all we do that's it
like just the pr just pull back the
kimono right there in the pitch and just
see how they react after talk after they
talk to a 100 people open a Google sheet
have them rank like the yay NE on a 1 to
10 scale right one is just pissed and
hung up 10 is I took his credit card
information over the phone and after 100
gutter cleaners just go from there or
whatever happen that's like enough to
say okay gutter cleaning till let's like
really scale this up or let's scrape
this and try Finn's repair company okay
yeah and you can also say we're so cheap
because we know exactly what we're
looking at like we know what like when
we see this transaction for Bob's
cleaners we we know that your gutter
cleaning solution or whatever like I'm

[39:00]
cleaning solution or whatever like I'm
bsing as I go it's just we know what to
look for when we look at your books it
like we can immediately translate it
that's why we're so cheap whereas that
is one reason the other reason is
because you're using offshore Talent
cool all right brother you killed that
man thank you thanks yeah let me know
how it goes yeah for sure thank you yep
what's up we're here Ryan how are you
man good Ryan why don't you introduce
yourself yeah not very good at this but
I'm Ryan snedden and I co by the local
newsletter guy on Twitter that's what I
made my life into over the last three
and a half years started loal newsletter
just email people was happening my town
started once a week switched to three
times a week and now we do it five times
a week it's my full-time job um GNA do
more here soon and I started writing
about what I'm doing teaching other
people how to do it that's media my
thing I don't know anouncing sorry
announcing another media thing here I
was trying to do it this week but having
some technical difficulties getting

[40:00]
some technical difficulties getting
something set up so it'll be next week
but yeah I like media that's my thing
I'm not awesome traded or anything I'm
an engineer but that's what I figured
I'd like to be good at yeah it's been
fun following you and the the uh growth
of naptown scoop and everything else
you're doing so I'm excited to meet you
and hear your
question yeah it's fun to get you on
here and actually talk to you because
we've see a lot a lot and even talked
about starting a little media thing
together but yeah it's fun to actually
be here so should we just jump right
into the question yeah let's get into it
all I know is you're exploring a
Business Partnership and you want to
know what I think about the structure so
let's hear the details yeah man I feel
like I'm on like the Dave BR to show
right you're about to you're about to
come in and yell at me on the air but so
I one of the things that I always
thought I was going to do through the
local newsletter was start other
businesses in town because I have almost
half the town reading our thing every
day 18,000 people reading in a 41,000
person town so I always figured if I
ever did anything i' have an unfair

[41:00]
ever did anything i' have an unfair
advantage on marketing and advertising
could also unfair Advantage block out
any competitors from advertising so
that's always what I wanted to do and
one of the things I've always liked the
the idea of to do is a portable restroom
trailer business I know that you like
this business because you wrote about it
a couple months ago and I've been
looking at it probably about a year
before you wrote that and that was part
of the thing that me and I ignited it
and I was always thinking about doing it
with this one partner who is a great
operator um great business operator got
this great business mind but I think a
lot of people are afraid of him right
now because his last business failed but
that's because he just chose the wrong
thing like he was trying to reinvent
greeting cards and greeting cards don't
need to be reinvented it was like a
little classic startup that raises a
bunch of money that should never even
been started kind of thing so he had
wind that down but he's got this awesome
business mind and so we're going to do
this thing together these portable rroom
trailers and S a long story to say Mir
thinking about doing a 50/50 partnership
and then basically that same week that

[42:01]
and then basically that same week that
we were talking you and discussing that
part of it you sent one of your Chris G
newsletters which are awesome and
basically said don't ever do that I've
done it before and here's why it went
bad and and I would do this instead and
so I asked him he was like what what
would you do here in this case
considering we're doing equal money
invested for both of it we're both going
to be working on it pretty part-time he
has a full-time job I've got down to
scoop my business and I'm doing other as
well so pretty similar workload for each
of us exact same investment financially
with cash but then I'm going to be
giving some advertising from our
newsletter into the business which if
you want to quantify a cash value of it
is an
additional half of a dozen thousand
like5 to $10,000 extra contribution that
doesn't actually mean I'm spending five
extra thousand but I'm losing that
Revenue potential in the business and it
isn't if anybody else wanted adverti
that's what they would be paying and
asked you an email and you said why

[43:01]
asked you an email and you said why
don't we ask for a show and so here we
are okay so $5 to $10,000 is the value
of the audience that you bring and then
in addition to that you're putting in
you two are putting in the same amount
of money is that right yeah so we each
had to put down a little bit to get the
deposit and actually buy this trailer
and then we're going to finance a little
bit of it and then use some zero
interest credit cards as well so not a
huge actual Financial outlet for either
of us but
uh whatever we do out L it'll be the
same for both of us so are you roughly
saying that your bulk of your value is
going to be from the audience you bring
with your newsletter and the bulk of his
value is in the operations piece yeah
that's how the the workloads going be
split up he's good at that part I'm good
at marketing and then everything else
we're either going to figure out
ourselves or hire other people to do
okay and you guys live nearby will you
be meeting together in person regularly
for this business yeah he's about 20
minutes away from my house okay so I I

[44:01]
minutes away from my house okay so I I
had to pull up my newsletter so I could
remember what I wrote so this is I'm
going to read verba in what I wrote I
said how to split the pie up here's what
works best in my experience two partners
at 50/50 this only works when one both
are working physically side by side no
remote two both are all in on the
business no side projects or other jobs
three both have contributed the same
amount of capital four both have similar
amounts of value to add they don't have
to be the same type of value however
like we're talking about here if one is
an engineer and one as a marketer great
if all four of the above aren't true
don't go 50-50 50-50 is the easy
fallback but it's really a good idea
remote Partnerships can really suck just
like long-distance relationships can
suck they don't have to but you have to
be much more intentional to allow them
to thrive whereas a 50-50 in-person
partnership just flows so with that
obviously I'm saying generalities there
are exceptions to everything how how
often do you guys think you'll be
meeting in person about this business

[45:01]
meeting in person about this business
and and does he have other businesses or
other side Pro projects like you do and
will continue to have he does not and I
don't anticipate that he will the the
understanding the Tre us if this goes
well and we end up making it into what
would be a full-time business for
somebody then he'll be uh leaving his
job and doing that because he's a pretty
part-time consultant right now anyway so
that's there I think it'll be I how
often we meeting in person uh probably
pretty often in the beginning every week
maybe just to see how things are going
if there's actual jobs to be discussed
but I don't know how often we're going
to meet in person for IT that depends on
how many bookings we get because I think
in the beginning we're going to go
deliver this thing together so we both
have a really good understanding of how
we're actually operating and when we
eventually pay someone to deliver it for
us we want to make sure that we really
know the process so that we can trade
them up to do it the way that we want
because every that I do I want it to be
a really great great product so I want I

[46:01]
a really great great product so I want I
want to know that that forers before I
trust someone else to do it what who was
the who came up with the 5050 idea in
this case that was his idea okay and did
that what was your gut reaction when you
heard that my gut reaction is no just
because I like the idea of there
being somebody who is at the end of the
day ultimately responsible uh it's not
so much he I'm power hungry I need to be
in control kind of thing but it's at the
end of the day I like the idea that one
person whether they're the right person
or not and hopefully they're the right
person but that somebody at the end of
the day can say what um we screwed up
that's my fault I'm I am ajor of this I
I take full responsibility I'm going to
fix it or if we're stumbling around in
the dark somebody to just say you know
what guys we're going to go this way and
we might not be going the right way but
we can adjust later but I have the right
say this and we're going this way that's
just like my life experience I've been

[47:02]
just like my life experience I've been
that person it's like in college I ran
our friend group when when there was
that sitting around Friday night nobody
knows what to do I'd be like all right
guys we're gonna go do this and even if
it's not the most fun thing we're at
least it's going to be better than
sitting around and then in business I
just as some I don't have any fighters
in naptown SCP I read it all myself it
just it is easier and there's just one
person is at the end of the day
responsible for the good things that
happen than the bad you know what I hate
more than Hitler as a baby I hate ads
you hate ads we all hate ads that's why
I don't have ads that's why all I ask
you to do is to leave a five star riew
like And subscribe that's it that's all
I want you to do maybe tell your friends
or 10 and how long have you known him
about two years now okay and I assume
you trust him pretty well yeah trust him
completely 100% And we worked together
at his other business is start up was a
client of mine okay has he done anything
successful in business before his last

[48:01]
successful in business before his last
attempt not as an owner okay what about
as a an
employee yeah he's a great salesperson
great operations guy he's been working
at a high very high paying tech jobs and
mostly software Tech stuff for the last
25 years okay do you think that this
business just knowing what type of
business it is has enough work to be a
full-time thing for him if not how long
do you think until you can get to that
point I think getting into a full-time
business probably takes three to five
years and you you think about delivering
these things they're mostly on weekend
rentals if you're delivering 30 weekends
a year that's far from a full-time thing
also managing the bookings of that is
far from a full-time thing but if you're
all of a sudden you're talking about
four trailers five trailers and then
you're delivering over a 100 a year then
people other people are getting involved
you're managing those people maybe
you're still a to jump in on your own
side yeah probably that two to five here

[49:00]
side yeah probably that two to five here
before it would actually be anybody's
full-time role if this is his only thing
and you have something else going on
what will he be doing in his spare time
if it's
part-time right now he would just be
doing his Consulting getting for his his
main main source of income right now
okay so in a sense he is doing something
else right like theoretically he could
get in a big Consulting client that
could pull his attention away yeah right
yeah yeah okay and um what was I going
to ask the the number one reason why I
don't like 50/50 is because it's it's
just so easy hi 50/50 but when you can't
most businesses last what one to five
years right you have no way of knowing
what this business will look like in
four years maybe in four months it's not
even a a a trailer rental business
anymore maybe it's something completely
maybe you found out that there's so much
demand for wedding chairs and so you
went and bought a bunch of chairs and no
one wants your trailers and that could
change the D Dynamics in a small but
meaningful way over time that's my
number one beef with 50-50 is like it's

[50:02]
number one beef with 50-50 is like it's
never actually 5050 effort it it could
easily be 50-50 money it could easily be
50-50 effort in the beginning but over
time that number is going to drift one
way or the other and you could also make
the argument that it's never actually
6040 it's never actually
7327 right you just don't know and so
have you guys ever discussed the
possibility of the equity being
different 6040 to one of you but the
operator draws a salary at a certain
trigger
point yeah we discussed we discussed
different uh Equity splits but we never
discussed salary like that okay and how
will the distributions go will they just
be
5050 yes the clear grade we talking
about it okay so that was my beef with
50/50 in general my potential concern
with this business
is that you're writing a newsletter it's
pretty public you sit at home it's great

[51:02]
pretty public you sit at home it's great
it's fun I I'm I'm generalizing here um
and he's out there you know attaching
trailers hauling them all over town gets
a flat tire these little things really
add up over time and even if you're at
home like hitting Facebook ads driving a
ton of sales driving a ton of value in
his mind you're out of sight out of mind
and it's a gosh and he might doing the
lowest value thing in the company right
grunt work minimum wage grunt work but
even so he's ah what's Ryan even doing I
just he's just sitting at home and you
could be doing a ton but you don't know
right you're in person but at the same
time you're not running it together in
person like for instance a a software
product where you each show up at the
same time you work in the same room and
you're just talking you're looking over
each other's shoulder okay let's do this
let's try that that's what I'm referring
to when I say a 50-50 partnership can be
beautiful but even that over time as you
hire employees and roles change and one

[52:00]
hire employees and roles change and one
guy becomes an executive but the other
guy is bad with people so he just keeps
engineering like then problems can arise
there too but I've just I've been in
that boat where you start 50/50 and then
even if you were to put in all the
equity it's just a different Dynamic
when the guy is out there operating a
kind of a physical manual business does
that make
sense I just think that
you should probably confront that right
now and say Here's Where this could go
right and just talk about what happens
when or if that happens I would also
suggest that you find a neutral third
party that really doesn't know either of
you two someone that's truly neutral
that can be that tiebreaker U I'm not
going to say like you for sure have to
do 4951 for sure it needs to be 6040
50/50 can work because there is no
perfect partnership structure but but I
definitely recommend that you schedule
in monthly or quarterly like hard

[53:02]
in monthly or quarterly like hard
conversations it's like how we feeling
how are we feeling about this or and or
keep track of your time each of you
honestly it's really annoying but it
works I had a a partnership meeting
years ago and we all sat in the same
room and we were having this
conversation in person and it was not
awkward and me and this other guy came
up with this brilliant idea uh and then
we proposed it to the other guy and we
were like hey we're just going to keep
track of our hours and we'll make prata
distributions based on what our hours
were and we we had this idea because we
suspected that we would be putting in
most of the value and they hated this
idea oh no no wonder why and they were
like value isn't time like time like I
could come up with an idea in five
seconds and on an hourly rate that's
nothing but that idea could change the
whole company like value and time are
not the same thing and yada yada yada
and so we didn't do it and guess what
happened they didn't add any value and
it blew up in our faces right so I'm not

[54:02]
it blew up in our faces right so I'm not
saying that will happen to you but I'm
saying now I have a one of my
Partnerships and we track our time we're
5050 we're remote this isn't Nick and we
track our time and it works and last
month I put in two and a half hours and
I got paid like 200 bucks in
distributions and he put in 100 hours
and he got paid and we're both thrilled
about it it's annoying and we have to
guesstimate I'll go days without
tracking my time and look back ah maybe
20 minutes and it's not perfect but I
trust him and he trusts me and it's
directionally accurate does that make
sense or you have any thoughts as I say
all that yeah no I think it makes sense
I think tracking the time will probably
be important I think at the beginning it
will be a lot of together time and then
after a little bit of time doing this
thing and kind of getting things figured
out it will be together time anymore and
and then tracking the time will be more
important it's not I'm with the right
person to talk about this cuz I never
Happ been but I like getting married
right it's super easy on the honeymoon
then you got to figure things out a

[55:00]
then you got to figure things out a
couple months later Weeks Later how long
it takes years later I don't know I'll
let you know when I get married but uh I
think that's what it's like right now
it's all fun and it's a new business and
it's cool and we think we see an
opportunity in the market and we think
we have a way to do it better and it's
just fun right now it's easy so I think
I it's good to talk about and think
about what happens when this goes well
what happens if it goes not well what
happens if I do all the work or you
endend up doing all the work I think
it's really important I think feel like
this story dies for my I'm doing another
business which is a little bit easier
all on the internet at the same time as
this which I was hoping to tweet about
today but I have some some annoying
issues that prevented us from launching
today so you're listening to this Cliff
I'll tell you why later um but we did it
on the phone we just decided to do this
thing together it's like a small project
not putting any money in it might turn
into something fun big and we literally
just flipped a coin for the majority
stake and I think it's a great idea
because I won but I don't know stup idea
that's hilarious no it's it's much
easier to have hard conversations when

[56:01]
easier to have hard conversations when
things are fun and light and then it's
and this is what this is why we have
these conversations because just in case
but it's much much harder to have those
hard conversations when things are hard
right so it's if you intentionally sit
down and you just get ahead of it and
this is going to be awkward and I don't
have anything in mind I just let's just
cover all these bases and I'm going to
put this in an email and send it to you
that way there's a record of it maybe
you get it formally written up maybe you
don't yeah if I were to summarize
everything F50 is cool just work in hard
conversations have the hardest
conversation now have a third party
tiebreaker talk about things because
this is sounds like a capex heavy
business talk about right now you're
putting the money so maybe in three
months if this is blowing up hey we need
two more trailers it might just be
understood that you're the money guy but
you might be like if I'm the money guy
then I need more equity and he might be
like I thought that's understood you're
the money guy I'm the Hands-On guy talk
about what happens if you haven't
already you might have already when you
do need more trailers and have to put in
significant Capital but I think you're

[57:01]
significant Capital but I think you're
you've got a good thing going and you're
going to you're going to be
successful yeah I think it'll I think
it'll be good and if it's not the great
thing about it is buying these things
and as long as you rent it a couple
times you're not going to lose money on
your resale because they don't
appreciate that much especially if
they're brand new like this put on
Facebook Market are you did you end up
buying one are you g to buy one for your
are you doing your gym business thing I
would I should I want to but it's like
idea number 32 right now so that
business that building is 100,000 ft
behind me right now but it's just
sitting empty and aren't you like moving

that maybe probably for the summer
