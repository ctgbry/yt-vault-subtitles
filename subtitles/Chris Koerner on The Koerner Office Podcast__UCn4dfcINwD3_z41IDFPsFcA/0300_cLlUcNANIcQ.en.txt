all right you guys have to see what I
found this Arizona mom makes six figures
renting out her donkey for weddings she
charges 750 bucks for a wedding and has
outrageous profit margins these donkeys
can carry up to 40 lbs of drinks and
come with flowers and signage but the
drinks are not included and these
donkeys wear a donkey diaper so they
don't make a big mess when it comes to
the wedding rental industry the more
unique the better here's how I'd copy
this business I'd start by finding a
boarding facility for $2 to $300 a month
cuz I don't want to store this donkey I
would scrape every wedding planner on
Zola and the not
and cold email them every month with
your unique offer I'd start posting in
local Facebook groups I'd make a Google
my business account and I know that one
rental per month will cover my cost get
your donkey's foot in the door getting
good with the wedding planners and then
you can start renting other things like
Photo walls wedding arches and photo
booth
