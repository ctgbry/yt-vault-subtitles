welcome to the ker office I wanted to do
something a little different today and
kind of pull back the curtain on how
much YouTube paid me in my first 60 days
of being monetized I've seen other
videos like this and they're not very
transparent they gatekeep a little and
I'm just going to share my screen and
put it all out there for you to see I
don't consider myself a YouTuber I'm
more of a serial entrepreneur that
happens to have a YouTube channel
YouTube is tough but I want to show you
that it is doable even if you don't have
an audience it is a smartest algorithm
in the world and it will keep fighting
for you until it finds your audience so
I'm going to show you how much I made
what data I look for how I try to make
things go viral and then in a future
video I'm going to show you how I got to
54,000 subscribers in my first8 months
so be sure to subscribe so you can watch
that when it goes
[Music]
live some background on me I'm Chris
Kerner I live in Dallas Texas with my
wife and four kids I've been starting
companies my entire life since I was 11
years old selling used golf balls out of
a red wagon I've started multiple
companies worth seven to eight figures
in value or revenue or profit depending

[01:00]
in value or revenue or profit depending
on how you look at it I've had a bunch
of failures and I invest in RV parks for
a living as well so three main things
start companies invest in RV parks make
content about all of the above let's
talk about how to get monetized so
YouTube wants you to have 1,000
subscribers and 4,000 watch hours in the
last 12 months and YouTube shorts do not
count as watch hours if you want to be
monetized on YouTube shorts then you
need 3 million views which is very hard
to get unless you've cracked the YouTube
shorts code which I like to think I have
and I'll talk about that later
even if you go viral before you're
monetized you will not earn a dime of
that money so you want to get monetized
as soon as humanly possible I posted my
first YouTube video in mid-February
which was my podcast episode with the
camera rolling the ker office and at
that time my podcast was me doing like a
Dave Ramsey style show but for
entrepreneurs entrepreneurs would call
in I'd hit record and answer their
questions on the spot so it took almost
exactly 5 months from mid-February to
Mid July everyone knows you have to be
consistent on any of these platforms so
I was I pushed out one to three long

[02:01]
I was I pushed out one to three long
form episodes per week and then a month
later I started producing about one
YouTube short every single day and man
those first YouTube shorts were bad
really bad they're still up you can see
them but don't I don't want to overhype
consistency though because everyone
talks about consistency this consistency
that and I think it can set a false
expectation that as long as we're really
consistent on YouTube or any other
platform we'll be successful that's not
true at the end of the day any social
media platform wants us to keep users on
their platform if you haven't posted in
3 years but you put out something that's
viral it will go viral if you post every
single day and you never put out good
content it will not go viral it will not
get seen every good video either long or
short needs to have these three things
an amazing hook so people keep watching
amazing content so people keep watching
and shareability now in long form
content shareability is not quite as
important the same with YouTube shorts
but on any other platform you need to
see 1 to 3% of people sharing that video

[03:01]
see 1 to 3% of people sharing that video
with someone else let's take a look at
my first few months of posting videos
and see how that went okay what you're
looking at here is my first three months
of views by week in my first
week I believe it was February 15th I
got 92 whopping views to my videos
357 2310 and then I took a step back and
then you see in March I got 177,000
views on my videos a lot of these are
driven by shorts though
if I go up here and set the filter for
only long
form you can see a little more
accurately 92 243 309 251 and then in
March I had over 1,000 in one week and
then I had over 1300 later in April now
a lot of this is driven by my Twitter
audience I had about 60,000 Twitter
followers at the time and before you
think oh no fair I don't have an
audience that I can point to it is
extremely hard to pull an audience from
one platform to another and here's why

[04:02]
one platform to another and here's why
people that go to Twitter for business
content find me for business they don't
go to YouTube for business content at
least most of them don't they go to
YouTube to watch survival videos or
something else and so if you have an
audience somewhere else and you just
think oh I'll just pull them from over
there it is not that easy is it a head
start is it helpful yeah it's helpful
it's better than not having it but it is
nothing you can rely on and I even had a
newsletter with about 7,000 subscribers
as well and I couldn't rely on them
either you just got to let the algorithm
work it's magic let's look at at the
next 3 months okay this is May through
July and you can see that I was getting
these are only long form videos between
a, and 12,000 views every week on
average I took a vacation for basically
all of June and I took a step back as a
result but in July I got pretty serious
about content and things started
exploding now let's zoom out and look at
the entire year okay these are my views
by week for the entire year right here
is when I got monetized July 16th

[05:00]
is when I got monetized July 16th
now one of two things happened here
a the algorithm said hey this guy's
monetized we want to make money from his
channel because if I'm making money then
YouTube is making money so the algorithm
prioritizes my content over
non-monetized channels that's one Theory
we all have theories but we don't really
know how the algorithm works because you
can see that my traffic exploded after I
got
monetized now the second explanation is
I had my first viral hit in mid July I
got really lucky and the timing worked
out perfect
and then in August I had a couple more
viral hits now keep in mind these viral
hits were not happening on YouTube
shorts they were happening on Instagram
reals and on Tik Tok and I will do a
whole other video about how to take
short form content from other platforms
and drive them all towards YouTube
because it is an art form and I love it
so I had two to five reals and Tik toks
going viral on Instagram and Tik Tok but
they did not go viral on YouTube until I
figured it out and so that Viral traffic
threw my call to actions at the the end
of these videos started driving traffic

[06:01]
of these videos started driving traffic
to my YouTube channel and people were
subscribing before even watching a video
because I was promising them content in
my shorts that would pay off in my Longs
on YouTube this is what it looks like on
a monthly
basis this last one here is October and
it's only the seventh day of the month
so that's not quite accurate but you can
see on a monthly basis after my vacation
in June where I took some time off
things have been climbing every single
month but you're here for the
monetization so let's get straight to
that I'm going to reset the filters to
show what has happened since the exact
day when I got monetized on July
16th until today October
7th we're going to go to estimated
revenue and we still have the filters on
for long form video so we'll turn that
off cuz I make most of my revenue from
shorts believe it or not okay we're
going to reset this to weekly and boom
okay so since getting monetized almost 3
months ago about 2 and a half months ago
I have made four

[07:00]
I have made four
$359 and if we separate out the shorts
and the
Longs from shorts I have made1
1575 and from Longs I have made 2775 so
I've made more money from long form
videos because my RPM my Revenue per
thousand views is much much higher but
I've had many many many more views on
YouTube shorts and it's actually
provided a decent income which most
people people can't count on shorts
providing any income because the longer
people spend consuming your content the
more money that YouTube can make on ads
therefore the more money they give you
for their ads now what's most
interesting about this content is the
RPM so CPM is cost per Mill in other
words the cost of an ad per thousand
views and then RPM is revenue per Mill
that means money to you per thousand
views so a good RPM for a YouTube
channel is anywhere between $6 and $10
that's considered good someone like Mr B
or dude perfect that has a young

[08:01]
or dude perfect that has a young
audience that's largely International
they might only make $3 to5 per thousand
views because their audience isn't as
high value my audience is primarily
business owners and aspiring business
owners and so they're worth more to an
Advertiser and so I'm going to set the
filters here for RPM and you can see
what
happens to my RPM over time so when I
started I was making
$866 per thousand views that's profit to
me before taxes but every single week
with some exceptions that has been
climbing last week my RPM was
$226 which is 2 and 1/2 times what I
started at a mere 2 and2 months
ago here it is on a daily
basis and here it is on a monthly basis
now the reasons for this are multifold
but a cpms are rising for advertisers
therefore if you're on the other side of
this equation and you're trying to place

[09:01]
this equation and you're trying to place
YouTube ads it's only getting more
expensive B YouTube is doing a better
job at finding my audience it takes
weeks months years for YouTube to find
the exact Persona of the person that
wants to watch my videos and thankfully
for me that person seems to be of a
higher and higher quality because my
RPMs keep going up so you can see right
here my average RPM over time is almost
$16 so if I post a long form video like
this is my best one ever so it is an
outlier it got 30,000 views I made
$204 for every thousand person for every
th000 people that watch that video or
$623 and here's what's really
interesting about human psychology that
I've learned from my RPM numbers the
videos that I post with very wealthy
people that have built big businesses
those videos do the worst from an RPM
standpoint let me show you an example so
this business here I talk about starting

[10:00]
this business here I talk about starting
a pet cremation business which is very
expensive to start my RPM was
$10.84 on this business I interviewed a
gentleman who started a chain of
high-end restaurants across
Florida my RPM is almost $10 there which
is well below my average but up here my
best video ever my RPM is twice as much
$247 and all I'm talking about is a side
hustle of how to put shelves together in
a garage you might think okay lower
value audience be watching some random
side hustle video about building shelves
and selling them on Facebook Marketplace
and a higher value person would be
watching about how to build a $10
million Alpine Slide or start a chain of
restaurants no and because what my
theory is is that people that are
aspirational and they just want to be
motivated but they're not really going
to take action they like watching videos
of Elon Musk they're not really
actionable but it makes them feel good
but people that want to make extra money
even $1,000 a month they're ready to act
they're ready to go to Home Depot and
load up their Corolla with 2x4s those

[11:00]
load up their Corolla with 2x4s those
people are action oriented and they're
in a phase of their life where they want
to make a change therefore they're more
valuable to advertisers let's look at
what my RPMs on are on YouTube shorts
I'm going to change the filter 23 cents
and these are also trending upward for
the most part last week it was 22 23 26
I average around 25 but it started much
lower than that below 20 that means if I
have a YouTube short get a million views
which I've only had a couple do that
then I make $250 from that video now
that's not much money but my shorts take
me about 30 minutes to produce and they
don't cost much to edit either so that's
a pretty good hourly rate for my time
furthermore YouTube shorts are very very
Evergreen which means they will live on
YouTube for months and years and years
YouTube will keep working hard for me to
show them to the right random audience
that wants to swipe on that random short
or long form video Let's recap this on a
screen that's easier to see all these
stats so if you look at my my last 90

[12:00]
stats so if you look at my my last 90
days I've had 7.3 million total views
the vast majority of those coming from
shorts I've had 98,000 watchtime hours
which is crazy because it took me 5
months to get 4,000 watchtime hours and
now I've had days where I get over 4,000
just in that one day I've added over
48,000 subscribers in the last 90 days
but I have about 50,9 183 total so it
took me 3 months to get 3,000
subscribers and then another 3 months to
get 48,000 subscribers which is crazy
that is just a lesson in compounding
keep putting out videos keep iterating
export your data on shorts you want a
high swipe through rate over 70% you
want a high average view percentage over
70% and you got to retain him throughout
the whole video as much as you can now
to revenue I've made about $4,400 from
YouTube which is great I never aspired
to be a YouTuber I still don't consider
myself a YouTuber it was just another
platform for me to my podcast where I

[13:00]
platform for me to my podcast where I
talk about business ideas and I go deep
on Niche business opportunities but I'm
really really glad I did because it's
fun it's addictive it provides an income
and I'm able to spread entrepreneurship
with the whole world so if you want to
see more business content like this how
to start a business tactically with
exact tools specifics none of the fluff
none of the guru stuff subscribe and if
you want to see more specifically how I
analyze my YouTube shorts subscribe
because that video is coming out soon as
well as well as one for long form videos
