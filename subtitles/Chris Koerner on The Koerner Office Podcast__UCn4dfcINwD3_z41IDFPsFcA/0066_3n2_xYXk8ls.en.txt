[00:00]
there's a 955 or 8020 going on here in
this room as well that most of us are
like this is just what you
[Music]
do welcome to the ker office today's
episode will be a little bit different
in April I was the keynote speaker at an
event called SM bash as in small to
medium-sized business bash and it took
place in Salt Lake City land of my
forefathers and they asked me to be a
keynote speaker on Saturday morning and
they said I could speak about whatever I
wanted and I thought I should speak
about finding that one company that one
customer that one business partner that
could completely change your life to
where if you find that one thing let's
call it a customer a huge Enterprise
customer that would five 10 20 extra
Revenue that if you were to find that
thing you'd be done you could check out
you could retire at 23 or 53 or 13
whatever it is I think that's a lot more
possible I know that's a lot more
possible than what people think or
realize I've seen it I've tasted it you

[01:00]
realize I've seen it I've tasted it you
could also call it an asymmetric bet I
called it a white whale and so I
entitled this talk you only need one
white whale because you really do you
only need one home run to be done not
that you will be done because business
is really really fun but that you could
be done so I tailored this talk to the
audience which was comprised of people
that had either just bought a business
or were about to buy a business and so
the examples I use were for people that
were about to buy a business and I
basically encourage them to think bigger
take 20% more risk for a 200% bigger
business with 200% bigger payoffs and
they really liked it and I spent about
13 hours preparing it and I had a lot of
fun giving it and it was a lot of work
and I might just write a book one day
called you only need one white whale
because I feel very passionately about
this topic so without further Ado please
enjoy my keynote speech and it's also
available on YouTube if you'd like to
watch the slides that accompany it enjoy
all right I'm going to set the stage a
little bit I'm on stage I'm going to set
the stage so no we got to go back

[02:00]
the stage so no we got to go back
all right I was in this building January
13 2005 it was my 18th birthday this is
Bayside High School not the Bayside High
School from Save By the Bell Bayside
High School in Palm Bay Florida I grew
up on the Space Coast so January 13th
about 700 p.m. I found
myself this laid out flat on a wrestling
mat Florida Sugar Sand pressed into my
face and a sweaty man on top of me that
weighed exactly 286 lb I weighed about
200 about the same as I am today and I
was wrestling for my high school
Astronaut High School and this guy on
top of me was almost 50% heavier than me
and it was because of this thing we
called murderer row on the astronaut
wrestling team so at the time the weight
classes were 189 215 and 285 but we
didn't have a heavyweight a 285 and so
every now and then Coach Hackney would
pull me aside and say he Chris you got

[03:00]
pull me aside and say he Chris you got
to wrestle up you got to wrestle up
which meant I'm going heavyweight okay
so that happened at Bayside but this guy
was an offensive lineman and he weighed
the maximum allowable limit to legally
wrestle in the State of Florida anyway
I'm on my stomach I'm trying to get up
because in wrestling you can get
penalized if you're stalling you're not
moving you're not working to a better
position it's it's heated the gym is
packed at least in my head it was
there's probably like 14 people there
and the other team is yelling he's not
doing anything he's not he's stalling
he's not doing anything and the ref
who's supposed to be composed looks back
at the team and says he can't do
anything look at him he can't
move anyway I ended up winning the match
like two to one barely and I wrestled
heavyweight like 18 times that year and
so my point of this oh and so Kenny was
my he weighed about 190 pounds and
legally in Florida if you wanted to
wrestle up you could only wrestle up two
weight classes and so he had to take

[04:00]
weight classes and so he had to take
these 5B weights at weigh-ins and tape
them to his upper inner thighs and then
walk into weigh-ins with bowlegged so
they didn't Clank together so he could
legally weigh enough to wrestle
heavyweight so Kenny was very grateful
that I wrestled heavyweight that day so
my point today is to talk about white
whales okay have you ever read Moby
Dick okay I probably like got the spark
notes in high school so I didn't
remember so Chad GPT helped so in Moby
Dick you got this guy Captain Ahab and
he's pissed off because he chased this
white whale and he lost his leg because
of it so then he was driven by Vengeance
to go back and get him and ishmail tells
the story from his perspective and I
won't spoil the end I'll get to the
ending at the end but Ahab had one thing
right and that's he just needed this one
white whale he just needed one and he'd
be set for life he had some other things
wrong but he had that right and so I
want to talk about that and what is a
white whale a white whale is a business
you're about to acquire or a business

[05:00]
you're about to acquire or a business
you've already acquired that could get a
customer that could change your life
that could change the trajectory of your
business maybe you want to buy a
$500,000 ebaa HVAC business in Omaha
maybe your white whale is a $1.5 million
EA HVAC business in Omaha okay I want to
show you
specifically why and how like why you
should look for a white
whale and I'm going to give examples for
people that have already bought a
business and people that have not yet
and how very specific specifically
strategically and tactically you can do
that and my goal is for you to have so
I'm getting thirsty here
so my goal is for you to have fomo like
I want you to be sitting there and I
want you to open up your laptops and
start to do some research like that's a
win for me if you're so like excited
that you just can't wait for this to be
over that's going to be a win I want you
guys to want to wrestle up like I did
like coach hack made me do so you can
can only like implant so much of that

[06:01]
can only like implant so much of that
and maybe you're thinking I don't have
the tools I don't have the the
motivation like I'm afraid with people
think but I'm going to help drive those
tools into you and drive that fear out
of you I found this headline online and
I loved it study finds 100% of men would
immediately leave their desk job if
asked to Embark Upon A transatlantic
Expedition on a big wooden ship so We
crave Adventure but we're not like we're
just like in spreadsheets all day but we
could still have Adventure in
spreadsheets we could still have
Adventure when we call up a seller and
we say hey I'm an NFL quarterback like I
love that bit last night from Jeff where
he said I can get any call because I'm
an NFL quarterback but Sam said we all
have competitive advantages right we're
just not thinking of what ours are like
what can we drop in that first call to
the seller that can get his ears to perk
up so who knows who this first guy
is brother young bam young okay briam
young March into the valley a couple

[07:00]
young March into the valley a couple
hundred years ago and said this is the
right place frankly I wish you would
have kept going to San Francisco but
that's okay Salt Lake's cool too okay
this next guy is my third
great-grandfather who was on that
expedition he was a Pioneer like I want
to be in my own kind of small Biz World
a Pioneer and he marched in alongside
Brigham Young and said this is a place
for me too and he raised a family here
and now here I am and I and I named my
fourth kid after him and this third set
of pictures for a few years I taught
Sunday school every single morning to
high schoolers and as I was thinking
about Adventure and thinking about this
talk I remember back to a time when I
said to them there's about 27 of them
most of them were boys and I said have
you ever had like a Daydream or a
fantasy about preventing an active
shooter situation and being hailed a
hero and they were tired it was a very
specific question they were tired but as
soon as I said
that every single boy had a smile across

[08:00]
that every single boy had a smile across
his face and it told me that like we are
all craving Adventure we all want to do
one big thing that could change the
outcome of our lives but for whatever
reason we're not maybe we're insecure
maybe we fear rejection maybe we just
don't have the tools of creativity maybe
we're worried about what people will
think you guys have heard stories about
people they're in a competitive home
buying market and they write a letter to
the seller and it works right because
sellers are people too and they feel bad
for them and they get the house we hear
about these
stories and we think they're probably
pretty common but I think there's some
survivorship bias going on we're not
hearing about the 95% of people that
don't think to do that they could do
that they probably have families too
they probably really want it to so my
thesis today is that there's a 955 or
8020 going on here in this room as well
that most of us are like this is just
what you do you go to conferences and
let's do 500k e a minimum and let's get

[09:01]
let's do 500k e a minimum and let's get
a broker let's get him on the phone
let's do like I'm asking you to try to
be in the 5% or the 20% or just to be a
little more creative to get a deal that
takes 20% more energy maybe 20% more
time maybe 20% more money but has 200%
more upside so these are my two examples
today a $1.5 million ebit at HVAC
business as opposed to a 500K ebit HVAC
business or if you've already bought a
business let say it's a 500K eida
machine shop okay so I know we all want
Frameworks we don't want to go full Tony
Robbins here and just talk about fluff
and Feelgood I'm going to give you some
specific steps number one we want to
identify all of our former and future
white whales I added former in at the
last minute because we've all done the
white whale thing before in some way
shape or form as I was planning this
talk so Kevin asked me to speak and I
thought all right what can I talk about
I like telling stor I got a lot of

[10:00]
I like telling stor I got a lot of
stories I'm going to talk about white
whales because I've got two really cool
stories that everyone loves at parties
and that can take up half the time and I
don't have to spend as much time
planning and then I started planning and
I was like man I'm not even going to
have time for those stories because this
is a pattern in my life like I try to
find these white well opportunities all
the time and I've gotten to the point
where if I have an idea I won't launch
that idea unless it's a white whale and
if the white whale doesn't work out then
I won't ever launch whatsoever so it's
like white whale or bust so think back
before you start thinking about your
next white whale what that business HVAC
business in Omaha looks like think about
what you've done from age one to
wherever you are today and that will
help build your confidence that will
help you realize oh I can do crazy
things like I asked that girl to marry
me she was the hottest girl in the bar
and I asked her to marry me and she did
like I could do things like I've done
things why don't why aren't I applying
that to this identify your former then
identify your future White let's say you
want to buy for whatever reason in Omaha

[11:01]
want to buy for whatever reason in Omaha
Nebraska okay and there's 36 500k EB
HVAC businesses and there's seven that
are 1.5 million and above those seven
are your white Wheels okay you're going
to generate ideas of how to locate and
identify your whales because we don't
just want like the office number or fax
number we want the owner's private cell
phone number preferably as home address
if you don't feel a little bit
uncomfortable that you might be stalking
then you're not doing it right
step three generate ideas of how to kill
your whale kill equals the offer because
you're not just going to Walts into a
guy that has a 1.5 million I I got to
find a shorter way of saying that that
has a a bigger business and convince him
to sell to you when he probably has a
lot more competition at that level of
Revenue step four execute untila failure
or success so it' be really sexy to say
just keep going until you get it like he
might not want to sell right these
aren't listed on the market and so you

[12:00]
aren't listed on the market and so you
have to get to that point where you
realize that the additional time and
money and investment is not worth it if
so then just pivot go to the next white
whale okay and then if you succeed find
another whale you only need one right
we're talking about one opportunity that
could change the outcome of your life
you only need one but we want more all
right so step one identify all your
former and future white whales how to
get to the number okay so let's say
we're the 500k EB a
number let's say we're having a
conversation what's your EB 500 could
you do six yeah I could do six yeah what
about seven it be pushing it what about
a million dollars oh I don't know I
don't know that's a lot because I've got
to quit my job and there might be a PG
on the line and my wife and your number
is your number but it needs to make you
feel uncomfortable it needs to be a
number where it's not going to bankrupt
you but it makes Mak you sweat a little

[13:00]
you but it makes Mak you sweat a little
bit and I don't know what that number is
for you but it needs it's not just a
goal it needs to make you feel a little
pressure okay when you go after these
white whales you need to start from
least to most critical so we're in Omaha
we've got seven maybe one is right next
to our house and it's just beautiful we
love it we're going to hit that one last
because we want to practice with the
ones that are still white whales they
still fit that criteria but maybe we
don't like them quite as much because we
might screw it up so we want to have the
most experienced when we go to number
seven the next thought here is you want
to be like you need to be intentional
about the process think of the Sardine
fisherman he goes out a mile or two
every single morning he slangs his cast
net he brings in some sardines he goes
to the market every single day everyone
knows and they talk to him like that's
not you anymore okay put that behind you
I'm going tell a story my business
partner Nick co-founders Nick is right
here he had been working for the man for
a while and he Saidi want to buy a
business and he lived in Southern

[14:00]
business and he lived in Southern
California forever and he's that's his
Market his wife love the area and he
said I want to buy a business in Boise
Ido in medical billing and he wasn't
thinking of it as a white whale but
looking back that's what it was and he
was like it's that or bust he looked he
found one it's $3 million he bought it
he did all the work I was a tiny
investor he didn't even need me I just
want to be a part of it because it
looked awesome two years later almost to
the day he sold it for $7 million and he
wasn't even the operator he gave an
operator 10%
from 3 to seven in two years so it was
this white whale so I'm telling you be
intentional about this process like be
very thoughtful as you go throughout
this process knowing like this will
change my life this is going to be a
bigger deal than I expected and I'm
going to continue until I snag my white
whale all right you want to generate
ideas of how you can locate your
whale that can be the hardest part so
let's go to the Machine Shop analogy

[15:01]
let's go to the Machine Shop analogy
you've already bought a business okay
let's say you have a machine shop in
Dallas Texas that sells to hobbyist
small business owners your average
customer gives you about 10,000 a year
let's say 20,000 a year 25% margin and
500 Grand ebit a year you read an
article that saffron which is a publicly
traded airplane seat manufacture located
an hour outside of Dallas in Gainesville
Texas they just got a big Airbus
contract and they're going to be making
a lot more seats and you know that
you're FAA certified which you have to
be but you don't really have any seat
manufacturer customers this is a
publicly traded company much bigger than
your current customer base but they are
going to be making so many of those
seatback Fasteners and they could use
you for this okay so this is your white
whale because your average customer
brings you about $5,000 a year in net
profit these guys would bring you
$500,000 a year in net profit they need
you right they don't know that you're
tiny they don't know that you don't have

[16:01]
tiny they don't know that you don't have
other publicly traded customers they
don't care they want a good product and
a good service and you can provide that
to them I think back to the office of
that episode where they're trying to
snag that big customer and they show up
at the front desk and they call the
office and like this is why we're
different you remember that episode and
they call and then pay them answers and
they're like oh like why they're being
creative so this is specifically how you
can find more contact information on
sellers or on customers T and we'll send
out these slides afterwards T is like
really hard to get software you're not
going to want to mess with it but you
can go to upwork and you can find
Freelancers that have access to t t
gives you so much information on a
person that you feel like you're
breaking the law as you read it which is
perfect okay CPAs you've heard the
phrase Higher One to higher 10 don't
just go to one seller at a time go to
one person that touches hundreds or
dozens of sellers they know their books

[17:00]
dozens of sellers they know their books
they know they have a good business or a
bad business you could skip the whole
process of going directly to sellers if
you just went directly to CPAs and say
hey do you have any HVAC businesses that
might want to sell that might be getting
near retirement age upw work go to upw
work and just say I want a skip Tracer
they're very affordable uh search bug I
use search bug for Mass validating phone
numbers it's like 3 cents each you
upload a list of phone numbers and it'll
say landline VoIP cell pH okay outs
scraper I use to just scrape large
quantities of businesses across Yelp
Google Maps or anything truthfinder is
like a cheap background check service
like a light background check service SL
broadcast you can use for sending
ringless voicemail drops let's say you
have 400 white whales on your list you
can send a voicemail to all of their
phones without their phone ever ringing
for about 20 bucks email Sherlock it's a
way of like a reverse email Serv sech
where if you have their email but not

[18:00]
where if you have their email but not
their address you just upload the email
and it will give you everything else on
that person phone validator is the same
thing as search bug but just one at a
time if you have seven white whales just
go there and type in seven phone numbers
at a time and then batch skip skip
tracing is like T but in bulk I like to
find sellers where they're not where
they are but they're not known okay
straa maybe they're like they're really
well known on a social media platform
but they're also on straa and if you
comment on one of their straw activities
you'll compete with no one so I get a
ton of DMS on Twitter and I don't read
most of them but I just started on
Instagram and like every DM is like oh I
got a DM so I read and respond to all
those
YouTube find their YouTube comment on
their video I know a lot of these Boomer
sellers probably don't have YouTube
accounts but they could be commenting on
other YouTube videos good reads anywhere
someone has a a username you could find
them and you can comment on them Trip
Advisor I found a seller on trip advisor

[19:01]
Advisor I found a seller on trip advisor
once and he was just a Serial Trip
Advisor guy just commenting on all these
things I found him there paid LinkedIn
ads I read a story about a guy who
really wanted this job and so he went he
found the guy that would be hiring him
that was just getting mobbed and he used
paid LinkedIn ads to Target ads with
like his face pointing at himself naming
the hiring manager by name first and
last name and said tell your friend John
to contact me to hire me and so John
starts getting all these texts all day
long from all these randos on LinkedIn
saying hey how what what is going on
here like are you being scammed right
now PayPal this is genius okay take a
list of email addresses you don't care
if they have PayPal accounts or not you
upload it to Paypal in bulk you send
them all 5 cents two cents a dollar
whatever PayPal if they don't have a
PayPal account even better because
PayPal is now hungry for them to make an
account so they can CLA claim their
money okay so PayPal will do all the

[20:00]
money okay so PayPal will do all the
followup for
you and of course like PayPal doesn't
know or care if it's 2 cents or
$2,000 they want to play on you wanting
that
money how brilliant is that okay cash
app or venmo same thing find them there
send them a dollar get their attention
part two find all their usernames on all
these platforms go to Google search for
their username in quotations and Google
will show you all the other websites
message boards weird places Reddit where
they're using this username that you'd
never thought of
okay Twitter advanced search if you
don't use this you should this is my
friend he just posted about finding
contact info here you go to Twitter
advaned search there's not really an
easy way to get there other than just
Googling the phrase Twitter advanced
search and then bookmarking that page
and then just searching like contact
info yada skip tracing so I did this to
find John
McAfee back in 2018 I had this idea I
thought I could predict where crypto was
going and John McAfee the most private

[21:02]
going and John McAfee the most private
person in the world the late John McAfee
I didn't know his email no one knew his
email so I guessed it you can guess his
email so I just tried JM mcafee.com John
McAfee they kept bouncing
back oh man that was
aggressive and I found his email and
then I showed up at his house after he
said I could show up at his house okay
it was 1 123 on February 27th
2018 and we started a business together
and we got 60,000 customers and it grew
really fast and then crypto crashed and
it all crashed and then he died in a
prison in Spain classic story we've all
been there we've all been
there but this guy if I can contact this
guy that does not want to be contacted I
promise you can find a guy in Omaha that
owns an HVAC business okay I didn't use
any of those tools they didn't work I
guessed as email step three generate
ideas of how you can kill your whale

[22:01]
ideas of how you can kill your whale
which is the offer okay and I got quotes
from Moby Dick on all these slides from
hell's heart I stab at thee for Hate's
sake I spit my last breath at thee okay
you are going to get this whale you're
going to get it you need a good offer
you need to be creative okay if you're
not creative then go to a friend someone
in this room is really creative ask for
their help so this is your strategy
pride get his pride involved this this
is why you never want to say to a seller
he what's your bottom dollar okay never
say that because if his bottom dollar is
let's say it's a million bucks and
you'll pay
1.2 and then you're like I really like
genuinely I can't pay more than
1.2 he already told you his bottom
dollar was a million now his pride is
involved and pride is like the most
powerful force on Earth and so now he's
like you don't want to compete with his
pride so just say to him like Hey like
what's a ballpark it's my favorite word

[23:00]
what's a ballpark it's my favorite word
ballpark what's a ballpark he says a
million it's like okay we could get to
1.2 maybe he's not prideful you say
botom dollar and he says one he still
comes up anyway but don't mess with it
flattery you want to compliment him on
his business he will love you he loves
that business he spent 30 years on it
comp like complement specific things
like you got a great business here no
like I love how you expanded to Lincoln
back in 2017 that was really smart I I
feel like the college is blowing up I
feel like college towns are a good place
to be like wow W this guy with a with a
vest really knows his stuff friendship
are you more likely to get money from a
friend or from a
stranger become friends with them play
the long game he will be more likely to
accept an offer that he would not be
likely to accept if you're friends okay
storytelling tell them a story what is
your story went to Northwestern had this
investment Bing job 80h hour week weeks
I hated it my friend bought this HVAC

[24:01]
I hated it my friend bought this HVAC
business I thought man I could do that
we talked every weekend like tell him
your story don't just say yeah this is
this is my buying criteria this is my
buy box but the most important
thing stupidly good offer this trumps
all of those it's got to be a good offer
it's got to be creative it has to
benefit him it's got to be creative but
not too creative because if you try to
get into the weeds with this let's do a
JV and then we're going to buy back some
equity and then over time we'll earn out
he's going to be like dude how much do I
get so it needs to be creative but
simple right simple enough for him you
want to have an intimate knowledge of
his business like web. archive go to the
web archive and look at the history of
his website there's a good chance it's
never changed okay that's okay and just
try to do all this backr if you have
seven white whales you want to do as
much research as you can on all of them
why wouldn't you if you have a hundred
then you can be more flexible you can be
more loose in your approach
false confidence is confidence okay

[25:01]
false confidence is confidence okay
Jacob Becker I talked to him he had to
fly home he bought a business that was a
white whale okay a Florida events
business it was way bigger than he
thought he could afford there were 28
people buying for it and he was just
like I'm your guy like I'm goingon to
I'm going to take care of this business
and luckily the seller was also the
landlord so he knew they' could be
married for a time and he bought it and
it it changed his life it completely his
growth trajectory went from this to like
to that right it was a white whale false
confidence is confidence we talk about
I'm I just got to fake it till I make it
and then I'm and then I'm going to be
confident no when you're faking it
that's you being
confident that's it you're already there
and then just be transparent Jacob said
hey I'm like yeah I'm not most qualified
I I'll have the money at closing I'm not
I don't have the pedigree I've never
done an advents business but I will do
the best job with your business and I
will come up with the money that you're
expecting just like in like saying so

[26:00]
expecting just like in like saying so
much that you're cringe at yourself as
you do
it also this book is really
good I just I recommend that book so
creative deal structure these are the
tactics even more creativity and
positive raar I invented This Acronym
and don't get on me because there's an
acronym that's actual actually real
that's similar it means return on
additional risk okay so there are
economies of skill here so maybe this
white whale to go from 500 to 1.5
million iida it could be 20 to 30% more
risk more headache more hard AE but two
two to 300% more upside okay you've got
upside more upside on the exit because
you're starting from a bigger basis
think about that your return on
additional risk that's where you land at
your white whale mining Sy another story
how long ago three years
ago China backed out of Bitcoin mining
overnight and all these enterprising

[27:00]
overnight and all these enterprising
Americans wanted to get in on it myself
included and so Nick and I we started
talking about it and we had this
conversation where this is a very short
if we can get in on this now then let's
do it if not then let's just keep doing
what we're doing so we go to bis by cell
believe it or not there are still deals
on bis by sell we found two for sale two
mining facilities one was in Oregon they
were the same size it's measured by
megawatts this they were both 2 and a
half megawatts one was in Oregon it was
listed for $3 million
and one was 30 minutes from my house
listed for 750 okay and so this was this
is a white whale okay I didn't have 750
and this guy was getting mobbed okay
like bis by sell they already get mobbed
and then it was Bitcoin was going crazy
and then it was China had just exited
Mining and this guy was just getting
mobbed but Nick and I just kept beating
him up his name's Josh he lived in West
Texas I've never seen his face to this
day never he has such I won't say his
last name but he has such a generic name
I've never seen him on social media

[28:01]
I've never seen him on social media
never met him in person but I just kept
calling and calling we had a bunch of
conversations we became friends he's
like hey you remind me of me when I was
younger yeah I like you we ended up
doing a deal we paid 700 Grand down from
750 he seller finan 650 of it we only
put 50 Grand down we tied the repayments
back to the price of Bitcoin so as
Bitcoin dropped and and which it did our
payments got all the way down to zero
and he would hold them he's creative and
he could have sold all cash to anyone
else so this is possible and now we're
going
to we're in the process of selling this
facility for a pretty healthy profit
next story maybe you read this on
Twitter I went to bues four years ago I
said man these guys must crush it online
and I opened up my phone there was no
shop button and I realized they don't
sell it online they were like A2 billion
company at the time only 40 gas stations
believe it or not and so I cold emailed

[29:02]
believe it or not and so I cold emailed
the CEO wouldn't answer me you need to
sell online and I had a an e-commerce
logistics company at the time so the
pitch was we'll do it all for you fully
managed no response so we said what if
we launched it for them and then maybe
it becomes a business of our own maybe
they buy us maybe they sue us it's a
great story we don't know or maybe it
just generates a bunch of PR to drive to
our e-commerce fulfillment business it's
asymmetric so I took my family to bues
we bought one of everything it cost
$2,000 I documented everything we listed
it on a website cold emailed a bunch of
reporters they loved it they called bies
for comment said what do you think about
this website they said we've never heard
of it I want to talk to this guy so then
the reporter calls me back and says hey
the buy in-house Council wants to talk
to you I said here we go all right I'm
filling the pantry we're gonna have a
lot of snacks and we talked and he said
hey I love this idea idea we love
e-commerce we just don't want to do it

[30:00]
e-commerce we just don't want to do it
if you want to do it pay full retail
market up as much as you want just don't
confuse the customers there's this thing
called first sale Doctrine where you can
sell any company's stuff you just can't
pretend to be that company so we put
some disclaimers up there and we've been
in business four years and do mid seven
figures in Revenue it's profitable and
just growing steady Edy we're like the
only website dedicated to reselling
Bucky stuff and it all started with what
have we tried this wouldn't that be
crazy
so step four execute until failure or
success Captain Ahab failed for a very
specific reason okay he was driven by
Vengeance he was driven because this
same whale had taken off his leg and he
was pissed off okay you are not driven
by Vengeance or Revenge I assume so
ishmail the the narrator of the book was
the only Survivor That's How It Ends he
didn't kill the whale here I am talking
about white whales and it didn't even
work in the book that I'm talking about
but it's because his why was off he had

[31:02]
but it's because his why was off he had
the wrong why and he didn't pivot he
could have said all right I tasted a
white whale he took off my leg that's a
lot of blubber I can sell that for a lot
of money I'm going to go find another
one or he didn't get out there and like
was about to like they had all kinds of
crazy experiences and he just kept going
he could have said at any point let's
just this whale's a little crazy let's
just try a different whale he could have
pivoted and I'm telling you guys if the
seller is just saying no go down the
line pivot so those are the failures
that he made step five the last step
rinse and repeat better to sail with a
Vengeance seeking Captain than none at
all chip on your shoulder so when that
first seller tells or the first seat
manufacturer tells then just let that be
a chip on your shoulder and drive you to
the next
one these are some of my white white
whales I wrestled up in 2005 in Hungary
I served a for my church and it

[32:00]
I served a for my church and it
completely changed my life I I left a
gamer and I came back just ready to
conquer the world 2010 I was in college
I signed a 5-year lease with a personal
guarantee for a store that was like the
dumbest decision to all of my mentors at
the time I wanted to fix iPhones and
they said start in your dorm room start
small and I was just like no I'm going
for broke and I don't recommend that but
that was my white whale and I exited and
made a lot of money for a 20 something
year old
2014 I had another business and we were
living in Alabama we were happy and I
looked at all my customers and they were
within a 1day drive of Alabama thought
there's not a lot of big cities within a
one-day Drive of Alabama so I pulled out
a map I saw Dallas we had one day
shipping to all these big metroplexes we
moved my family to Dallas and my
business went from this to
this um McAfee story The Bucky story
and I just want to tell you guys like
you're

[33:00]
you're
ishmail this is you guys right now okay
and so I can give you a lot of ideas you
can write down these websites but it's
up to you to execute on this
plan so this is the acronym it'd be
great if it worked out to like this
being a talk about having a bias for
Action yo now but no it's only you only
need one white whale and it's just
you're just taking asymmetric bets right
over and over upside your life
completely changes for the better cuz
right now you're probably thinking I'm
going to buy a 500K and do it for a
couple years and do another one you tuck
it in roll it up m&a and it's like let's
just let's skip a lot of that because
it's really it's not a proportional
amount of risk to the proport to the
amount of upside that we're talking
about downside you have a great story
I've got all kinds of white well stories
that didn't work out I did a Kickstarter
once completely failed we took my family
on a road trip around Europe
Serbia stopped us at the border and they

[34:00]
Serbia stopped us at the border and they
said you can't drive through Serbia
turned around and we went to Italy and
said we're going to go from Paris to
Greece and anyway it's a great story
I've got great stories so I've always
wanted to do this look under your chair
and you'll see a white whale sticker
okay seriously I put stickers under
every seat in here so you can put this
on your computer on your mirror on your
desk it's not a car it's not axus
it cost me about 46 cents a piece I will
admit but it could be a reminder for
you to chase your white whale okay and
now you're accountable to all this now
like I planted I hope I planted some
sort of a seed maybe you've got a little
bit of drive to just look at things
differently now you're accountable to
that now if you go home talk to your
spouse maybe your goal is the same maybe
it's different but you're at least
accountable to it I've noticed in my
life that all of these stories they all

[35:00]
life that all of these stories they all
started at the end of the sentence what
if we tried please try thank
you all right I hope you enjoyed that
speech thank you for listening or
watching and please like And subscribe
