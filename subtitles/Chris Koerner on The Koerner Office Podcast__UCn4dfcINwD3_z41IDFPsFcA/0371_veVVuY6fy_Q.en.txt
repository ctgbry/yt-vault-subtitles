here are the five most brilliant and
profitable vending machine ideas I've
ever seen starting with number five this
guy invented a vending machine that
disinfects motorcycle helmets it only
cost a few bucks and the profit margin
is 86% imagine putting these at gas
stations along scenic routes motorcycle
dealerships repair shops better yet you
can Market this as a disinfectant for
shoes and put it outside gyms and shoe
stores because that market is 100 times
bigger than the helmet Market this guy
invented a vending machine that sprays
cologne for $2 a spray with 88% profit
margins supposedly there's a grocery
store in Kazakhstan that makes six grand
a month from one machine if you really
wanted to get smart with it you'd put a
QR code under each bottle where people
can scan it and buy it with an affiliate
link that's drop shipped from someone
else's website you do no work and you
make 15 times what you'd make on one
spray you could put these outside of
bathrooms movie theaters restaurants gym
entrances walkable outdoor shopping
areas it's a brilliant business idea

vending machine profit margins are
literally 97% this is a brilliant
business because it's so visual the
cotton candy is made at the eye level of
the child so as the machine owner you
want those videos to go viral and as the
parent of the child that wants the
cotton candy you're going to buy it for
him a $10 serving of cotton candy costs
30 cents in sugar and the best thing you
can do is to secure the location before
you buy the machine visiting in person
is the most effective these machines
make between $2 and $10,000 a month and
they cost about $7,500 to $99,500 up
front you will not believe how much
money this guy makes with this rotating
platform off Time Square before I tell
you that let me tell you how you can

an immigrant from Tajikistan he moved
here with nothing but a dream bought
this rotating platform on Amazon for two
grand and set up shop with a permit
right outside of Times Square his worst
day ever was $200 and his Best Day Ever
Was $4,000 but he averages 2 Grand a day

business idea the best marketing is a
spectacle remember those power bands at
the mall kiosk where you put your arm
out and they try to push you over total
scam total spectacle that's why they
sold this is a spectacle it draws a
crowd and gets people to watch and guess
what everyone in that crowd is thinking
I could do that I bet I could do it
better than he could charge 40 bucks for
a 2-minute ride these should be in every
mall in America every outdoor shopping
area see malls do something that most
landlords won't and that's a
month-to-month lease so if you get one
of these things put it in a popular Mall
not a dying Mall plug the sucker in
start charging 20 to 50 bucks a pop 30
bucks a pop six Riders every hour 10
hours a day is $1,800 a day and your
only overhead is your lease and your one
employee that's Manning the attraction
