[00:00]
I had 30k in Revenue before I ever had a
website or domain or anything this could
definitely be a 3 to $400,000 company
here it could be 5 6 700,000 no doubt
how much of what we said did you go out
and Implement and it worked and how much
of what we said was it like yeah this
didn't work I had to go out and find
customers this way I'm not joking word
for word I had pretty much written down
the exact text to send the exact
softwares to try it out there's pretty
much no risk in my day-to-day that's
amazing I work with the same contractors
who continue giving me same sub jobs all
the time so my marketing spin is almost
zero and this wasn't going to hurt me so
I was like I'm going to try this
[Music]
today yeah Tyler I just want to hear
what your story is specifically like
what made you want to quit your your B2B
sales job and do this and how has it
been going so far yeah so that's a great
question so yeah I was in I I graduated
from college about four years ago I have
been in B2B sales since you have been
looking throughout that time to get
entrepreneurship in some way you know
classic I read buy then build and I was

[01:01]
classic I read buy then build and I was
like I'm going to buy a business and I
had zero doar in my bank account so that
you know slowly crashed down reality
wise and then looked into some service
franchises and there's a lot of moments
of cold feet I heard the idea about a
stump grinding business from your
podcast originally I've documented this
on on Twitter a few times but something
clicked there I'm not really sure why I
was on a tree crew in high school I'd
grind ground like a stump or two you
know a handle grinder at the time never
used a machine like what I used now but
yeah you kind of put it in a perspective
I was like oh that's kind of just B2B
sales I know how to do that and grinding
stumps is not that complicated like
maybe we can just give it a shot and see
what happens and and yeah it's slowly I
did not plan on ever quitting my job
with stop grinding I was like this will
help me save more cash and it slowly
progressed from there so you you've
always been a grinder always Tyler the
grinder that's what they call him he's
been grinding since College Chris you
didn't know that yeah I do now when do
we have that conversation Chris July

[02:02]
we have that conversation Chris July
July 11th I found the episode just so I
had it for my notes you know what I mean
when I when I heard it because I heard
it the day it came out and then August
3D is when I did my first three jobs
from July 11 funny enough Chris I you
were in Utah when we recorded that
episode weren't you it was serendipitous
that's that's perfect I don't really
remember the whole conversation what was
it about stump grinding that you're like
this is like B2B sales because I don't
think stump grinding is like B2B sales
but it is B2B sales this is literally a
B2B sales business 95 is% of my revenue
is is well what's the differentiator
reoccurring so it doesn't it's not
recurring but I work with the same
contractors who continue giving me Sim
same sub jobs all the time so my
marketing spin is almost zero so I build
a relationship up front with a company
that doesn't have a grinder they either
rent or you know they have an old one
that's just not great and it just makes
more sense to have someone else do it
either they don't love their sub current

[03:00]
either they don't love their sub current
or they're tired of renting and we build
that relationship slowly and then now
you know I just I I just make sure I
answer my phone and get back to text
really fast put it on the calendar and
get it done so these aren't residential
clients the majority of your clients are
like what apartment complexes businesses
let me interrupt you Nick let's start a
stump grinding business that only goes
through tree trimming Crews because
they're Outsourcing their stump grinding
to other people so his customers are the
tree triming business owners but their
customers are residential he's just not
going through residential customers oh
I'm a they're subbing it out to
him now I remember now I remember this
part of the conversation and for anyone
listening if they want to go back and
listen to this original podcast it was
episode number 37 July 10th B2B stump
grinding Cash Cow or DT that's right
because it wasn't just the stump
grinding we were talking about yeah okay
now I'm you on the 11th but yeah yeah no
we're we're all here it's it's perfect
I'm I'm I'm caught up we're here
physically yeah
all right so a lot of the stuff we just

[04:01]
all right so a lot of the stuff we just
talk about in theory right where we're
like yeah dude this is what you could do
here's the idea how much of what we said
I mean as mainly Chris's idea but like
how much of what we said did you go out
and Implement and it worked and how much
of what we said was it like yeah this
didn't work I had to go out and find
customers this way yeah I want to shout
out Chris on this I've mentioned this on
Twitter but and Chris I try to always
tell people what ideas came directly
from you still to this day I followed
liter I'm not joking word for word
there's 10 minutes of the podcast that I
probably listened to I don't know three
four five times and I had pretty much
written down word for word the exact
text to send the exact softwares to try
it out trying it in a different market
so I actually tried out tried it out in
boisey even though I was down here in
Provo I was never going to service a
stump in boisey but I wanted to see the
demand in a similar market so I
literally did everything from that
podcast did not change anything and and
you know there was stuff that wasn't
covered in the podcast like brands of
machines and you know trailers and
different things that are just logistics

[05:01]
different things that are just logistics
for the business that I had to go learn
myself but how to actually drum up my
first customers it was it was directly
from the podcast Nick let me jog your
memory even more yeah I went to upwork
and hired a virtual assistant to call
hundreds of tree trimming companies in
Houston because Houston's like a
comparable Market to DFW because we were
literally thinking about starting this
and then I shared that data with anyone
that wanted it in a spreadsheet and I
forget what it was it was like 10%
of the market was willing to to sub it
out to us and I think we covered the
data on a on a an episode like a month
later or so did you ever look at that
data Tyler and use it or was it just
kind of irrelevant yeah I got that
spreadsheet and that data I I mean I
looked at it it helped me organize my
spreadsheet actually and how I did some
of my Outreach and I asked you I asked
you about your cold caller and you're
like hey you know I'll give you it once
he's done doing this cold calling for me
and I was like all right that's fine
like I'll just go do it myself so I went
and and did most of the cold calling
cold Tech texting all myself early early

[06:02]
cold Tech texting all myself early early
stages gotcha so Boise was your test
Market Boise was my test Market what did
it show oh it was crazy I I remember the
first day I sent out like 45 texts and I
had guys calling me like dude you need
to be in this backyard in like 20
minutes and I was like whoa whoa you
know I was like easy easy easy you know
like I I I didn't there's some
uncomfortable conversations there I I
felt a little bit dishonest I was just
lying I'm not I just listen to a guy on
a podcast yes yeah I was like dude I
don't I can't grind stumps you guys are
crazy you know it it was yeah but no it
went fast that's how fast I did like
three days of that and then I was like
I'm going to stop doing this because I'm
starting to get into some really uh
weird conversations with people
following up with me like are you going
to show up I never told anyone I was
going to show up anywhere but there were
people you know telling me they had jobs
for me and but it was great I I used
those opportunities as like a
conversation I have an Arizona number
that's where I grew up and so I was just
like hey I'm coming from Arizona

[07:00]
like hey I'm coming from Arizona
this is the pricing down there like what
you what does the pricing look like up
here once again you can judge me for my
dishonesty I totally understand smart
yeah yeah yeah so you were framing it as
hey I'm already out of Market this is
what we usually pay help me understand
what the pricing is but really you were
just trying to get pricing yeah and
basically they would give me like oh
yeah it usually works like this up here
and I was like okay took a ton of notes
and then I was like I'm sure it probably
works pretty similar in Provo in Salt
Lake if people can't see Chris's face
but right now
hearing Tyler talk about like I didn't I
didn't lie to anybody outright and like
just how uncomfortable he was having
those conversations Chris looks like
James Franco in the meme where he's
looking over he has a noose around his
neck and he looks over at the guy and he
goes first time first time yeah that's
how that's how Chris looks right now to
Tyler I've had so many awkward
conversations that's all I do is just
send out texts to hundreds of people to
validate things or not and then it's
like oh my gosh next thing I know
there's a 80 foot Santa Claus in in my
front yard

[08:00]
front yard
yep that's true story first time dude
okay so so Boise was like oh my gosh yep
it's here it's a thing yeah I'm gonna
now do this where are you you're in
Provo I'm in Provo yeah of sorry proo I
believe that's how it's pronounced
correct proo yeah yeah
exactly yeah no that's exactly how it
went I I brought the same idea down I
actually kind of wished that early on I
was like I wish I was in boisey cuz I
got a little a little bit better and
like more opportunities in boisey than I
did in my area if only you knew somebody
in
boisey yeah I wasn't really willing to
pick up and move everything right then
but no it still worked out great I I
found my first two to three contractors
are guys that give me a ton of work
still to this day and then you know
after you land your first two or three
the worry of like not being able to pay
equipment or trailer or just some of
that stuff kind of leaves and it's just
building from there so it was awesome to
get to those first two three

[09:00]
get to those first two three
relationships in the first few weeks and
then slowly after that buildt but those
those first four weeks too I was doing
all this at a a office of a tech company
so that was fun are you just renting a
grinder and then going out and doing
these jobs or did you buy one I rented
for the first month I found a dealership
that was about to pull a new machine out
of their new like sales into their
rental Fleet and they said hey you can
rent this for the month if you you know
if you decide to buy it we'll just roll
the rental price into the the Buy price
which was an awesome win-win for
everyone so did you never end up doing
any jobs in Boise you just use it to to
test yeah Didn't I was I never traveled
to Boise at all so yeah it was just a
test Market it's not surprising to me
that the Outreach fared better in Boise
just because I feel like Provo is the
most competitive market in the world for
anything you've got like 880,000 return
missionaries that have been rejected a
million times each and they're just so
ready to launch a business like over not
surprising or it is surprising it's not

[10:00]
surprising or it is surprising it's not
surprising that you had better luck in
Boise because Provo is like the worst
for launching stuff if you can make
something work in Provo mark my words
you can make it work
anywhere if you can make it here kid you
can make it
anywhere freaking New York City I mean
Nick like on one hand you have all these
enterprising return missionary business
owners and then on the other hand you
have a bunch of people like me that are
like oh okay your price to 350 will you
do 14 cents like what yeah the
combination of those is world we look we
looked at Provo remember we did it with
for tree trimming what's his name yeah
for tree trimming and we were like oh
man it is high like hyper competitive
out here in Provo what was the time so
you listen to it on the 11th let's say
July
11th what's the timeline here between
July 11th and like your first booked job
like when when did you start doing the
testing in Boise when did you start
looking in Provo and then when did you
have your first book job so I listened
to it July 11th I think I sent my first
batch of texts July 12th as fast as that

[11:00]
batch of texts July 12th as fast as that
outs scraper thing happened I just
action I just went and the the cool
thing about this I have not always been
like this I just want to like kind of
play both sides of this a little bit in
in that like there was a direct way to
go test this in a different market and
this wasn't going to hurt me so I was
like I'm G to try this today and so July
12th I think I sent my first text by the
end of that week I was like this has
some legs to it like I started going
into dealerships and talking about or
you know learning about brands of stump
grinder I o emailed probably 50 owners
of stump grinding companies in different
states just like a quick like can I
interview you can I ask you a few
question that actually worked well for
me really well people are open with
their time especially these stump
grinders they were awesome and and kind
of got me up to speed really fast on
Brands and stuff but yeah anyways and
then I had my first book Job August 3 so
I remember two jobs that were four
stumps one job was three stumps and the
other job was one stump stump on August

[12:00]
other job was one stump stump on August
3rd that was a Saturday and it was it
was it was electric it was
awesome any like horror stories like any
just embarrassing stories you screwed
something up or something broke yeah not
on the day one but absolutely yeah I had
one at a town home complex it was for an
HOA and there's Roots running everywhere
and at the last second the tree guy was
like dude I need you to get every single
root out and I was like okay we can do
that but like we're gonna hit a
sprinkler line somewhere and he's like
that's fine you know like let's just do
it we we'll fix it yeah I was like all
right whatever dude yeah and this is my
first time working with them too so I'm
young and dumb and whatever and we go
hit the sprinkler line it's right next I
can't make this up this is a summer day
in Utah right next to a window of a town
home the sprinkler starts like the
highest pressure water you've ever seen
starts coming through this person's
window the window is open it's fine the
window is open I basically break into
their house I like slam slam slam they
don't come in two seconds I open I was
like hey it home you know cuz I do not

[13:00]
like hey it home you know cuz I do not
want to flood their whole living room
finally they come downstairs we shut the
window we finally figure out where the
sprinkler turn off is because HOAs are
weird it was like at the front of the
property uh and then he was like oh yeah
you're going to be on the hook for this
by the way so I never made any I didn't
make a dollar off that job which was
Nightmare a nightmare uh but yeah I mean
a few things like that but overall what
you do as a stump grinder as long as you
call in like utility locates it's pretty
simple was that derck
Sorenson it was Derrick senson wasn't it
freaking brother senson it was Braden
Christensen was it Bren Christenson gosh
dang it dude yeah yeah no yeah it was
yeah Joseph something yeah
yeah oh any other any other stories like
that yeah there was one where they
wanted me to fit through like a gap
between two sheds and then there was a
um electric line running to the back
shed it was a private electric line I
saw it I knew it was there I'm an idiot

[14:01]
saw it I knew it was there I'm an idiot
I was I was just like dude I can you
know do this whatever and so I I hit it
I couldn't do it I I'm an idiot and the
back shed was the home office for the
dad of that family didn't know that and
so he comes out like I hit it sparks fly
everywhere he comes out just pissed you
know like so mad and briefly so like
that that was
flip exactly what the freak is happening
you know and then I was like yeah I'm
sorry I hit this and I had to pay for
that one too those are really the two
worst ones outside of that it's been
small stuff here and there all right
here's my question for all the people
who were like act you can't do one of
these businesses without this type of
insurance this type of insurance this
but when did you actually get insurance
right away I did do that right away yes
yes I have this one felt a little bit
different it didn't feel like I was I
don't know what's you know running a
cleaning company good good good yeah
this one I felt like I was like I I
could actually probably do some damage
somewhere and so I got insurance right

[15:01]
somewhere and so I got insurance right
away both those things I paid out of
pocket but yeah that makes sense yeah
can you can you give me an idea so
August was your first month you've
you've quit your job like you're not
working you're you're grinding full-time
I quit my job September 1st yeah oh my
gosh dud so tell me what is the what's
your Revenue been just hit me August
September October November if you can I
have that somewhere I could break it out
individually but so it was 9500 in uh
August and then in September I had like
so much on the calendar that I was like
it's either I quit or I get fired
basically and so I actually NE I
negotiated some Severance because I was
pretty good at my job so I had a really
good book and I was like hey let me help
pass these accounts off to someone that
wants them and let me leave and they're
like yeah perfect we'll pay for a month
and I was like let's freaking go so
September was 23k so that was actually
my biggest month still to this point

[16:00]
my biggest month still to this point
yes probably because you're I was just
going to say yeah probably because it's
like in the summer going into fall
that's when people are doing the
majority of this type of work totally
and then through the end of the year I
did 69,000 in revenue from August 3rd to
the end of the year and then in January
I did like seven and this month I'll do
11 so it's starting to pick up again for
the spring holy cow even in February
you're doing 11 Grand yeah yeah we're
excited about that it's awesome I mean
are you grinding through the snow yeah
some days yeah I I try not to I try not
to do it on snow days but yeah some days
it's scheduled and it's not coming down
too bad if it's like a blizzard I'm not
going to be grinding a stump but if it's
some light snow yeah we'll we'll put on
a few jackets and go let's talk unit
economics like per job what is your
average job size what is your average
profit uh per job and how do you think
that'll change when you start scaling
and hiring yeah so I 390 is my average
job size um and that's skewed upward
probably because of a few outliers I've

[17:01]
probably because of a few outliers I've
had like a four grand job and a five
grand job that are considered you know
one job there I do not know my profit
per job just going to be honest there
hand up I I try to keep track of all
this stuff but I don't know that
currently that's okay I mean ref
ballpark like based on what you're like
because you own the thing now there's no
rental cost youve got gas your own time
I I have to think your costs aren't that
much no not at all I directly like my
stump graning payment's $99.90 I pay
$175 for my trailer and then I pay like
450 for my truck I park it at a storage
facility for you know 150 bucks and then
I have 450 of insurance monthly so like
total you're talking like two grand to
2500 of overhead and I make that like I
do $1,500 days routinely in the summer
and I mean that's paying down your
assets too most of it like right yeah
that's a good question how much did the
stump grinder cost so video is cool but
you know what's better long form audio
via podcast and my newsletter TKO

[18:02]
via podcast and my newsletter TKO
pod.com go there to subscribe for free
to my newsletter it's one email a week
very tactical and then go to my audio
podcast three episodes a week stuff like
this you're going to love it all free no
sleazy sales TKO pod.com stump
grinder was 55,000 so and so you're on
payments right you didn't pay out of
pocket I'm assuming yeah I had to put
20% down on that everything else that
was zero down on the gonna ask how did
you finance it there's some awesome
companies that will do startup loans for
heavy equipment where they still lend it
to your company with your personal
credit is weighted in there and they
kind of screw you with with interest
rates but hey I mean I was in the game
yeah exactly and my business credit
started growing so I actually was able
to get like a business credit card
pretty fast because of that so like
what's what's the term of the loan like
how long over over what's it how's it
advertised what's like what's your
monthly payment fiveyear loan 990
payment I put like 12 Grand down cuz I
had to put like 20% down so okay yeah
dude I was just doing the math as you

[19:00]
dude I was just doing the math as you
were talking and I'm like all right you
said month one 9500 month two 23,000 and
then you did 69,000 total between August
and December so you averaged about
$112,000 a month for the rest of the
year and then you said January and
February you've done about 11,000 a
month about yeah yeah just about across
the two what was your job before I was a
SAS sales rep if you will so selling
reoccurring SAS products so you're
probably making more money than this but
but you're like back of the envelope you
taking home at least n Grand a month
yeah what's so funny is because a lot of
you know personal expenses are rolled up
into a lot of the things that I do for
business like I the I am going to be
very interested to see after the end of
a full year with a lot of those upfront
costs already handled like I think I can
make more if I was going to be the one
grinding all all year this year which I
want to hire eventually but right now
it's just shoveling cash away I actually

[20:00]
it's just shoveling cash away I actually
think you'd be surprised how fast you
could hit the mark of like a good W2 if
you're just willing to like be out there
and just do do a lot of hard work well
that was going to be my question 23,000
in September was a good month you're
coming into the months where in this you
know spring and summer well you're
probably have big months again what's
your plan to be able to do you know 23
if not more than that I'm month so a few
things the first one was the beauty
beautiful thing about being a sub in the
last person to talk to the customer
is I've actually gotten a lot of reviews
without ever spending a dollar in
marketing cuz I leave and I'm like hey
this is my I have a little card you know
that you put on the back of their phone
and it pulls up my my review link there
I'm like hey I you know I work with name
the tree company all the time like I I
do all their stumps for them I'm a new
company like I'm here in Provo I'm
working hard like could I get a review
so I have 55 festar reviews we're
starting to get a little bit more
organic traffic directly from the
customer and starting to rank a little
bit better for stump grinding
specifically and then building more and
more tree relationships it's the biggest

[21:00]
more tree relationships it's the biggest
biggest thing I could do one tree
relationship can give me anywhere from
you know five grand on the year to like
20 30 grand on the year of Revenue so
it's just important that I build those
as strong as I can do anything I can to
land my first job for that tree company
and then do everything I can to you know
be be reoccurring for them so you're not
being super strict about like I I'm only
B2B like you would love both yes
absolutely are your subs or your Crews
that are referring you are they cool
with that have you T to them about that
or you just kind of leaving business
cards on the sly on the review part is
that what you're talking about yeah or
like do they care that you're you're
talking to the customer directly
probably not because it's you're not
competing with them right they love it
because I always I send them a message
like hey just got done it at Sally's
like she's super stoked on how it all
went and like in their head they're like
oh great yeah they you know they love us
so I always leave that little text after
and it's a loud machine so I always just
knock and I'm pretty personable so in
their head it's still the tree company
doing the service you know what I mean
that's the only person they've

[22:00]
that's the only person they've
communicated with so I don't think my
guys mind it too much what about unit
economics between you and the tree tment
company like what are they charging what
are they paying you yeah uh usually so I
price everything by an a measurement of
diameter of the stump so if you take the
widest diameter of the stump you times
it by $7 an inch is what I charge
usually I'll go above and below that
just depending on a few things but uh a
lot of tree companies will charge a
customer anywhere from like8 to $12 an
inch and they'll keep the part part up
top early on I was giving percentages of
that $7 an inch back to the tree tree
company but then I've been so good for
the tree companies that I've worked for
like so reliable that recently I've just
been like hey $7 an inch is my price if
you want to take a cut just charge you
know upcharge but I need the $7 an inch
and they've all been really cool with
that okay so the customers aren't paying
you customers aren't usually paying me
directly usually I get paid by the tree

[23:00]
directly usually I get paid by the tree
guy yep do you know what what per inch
that they're charging usually like 10 to
12 bucks an inch usually okay I guess
you said that okay and then sometimes
you know if it's a huge job they'll
throw stump in for free or you know
there's there's a bunch of things that
they'll do but usually the job will make
up for that if they throw it in for free
so when you go directly through the
customer are you charging 10 to 12 per
inch yes yeah absolutely usually I'll
sit it right around 10 when I'm going
directly on a if someone got my number
have you started getting Direct customer
referrals at this point yeah yeah some
Direct Customer referrals every once in
a while like tree companies just don't
even want to deal with the stump
grinding lead if it's a pure stump
grinding lead so they just shoot my
number over to that customer and I'll
get a call so are you still paying zero
dollar for marketing or are you starting
to invest in that I'm starting to invest
a little bit in some marketing SEO I've
paid for actually the whole time so I I
have paid for my friend runs a little
SEO company out here and so I've been
investing in that and like the website a
little bit but outside of that I'm
playing with some Facebook group direct

[24:01]
playing with some Facebook group direct
marketing potentially I think could work
yeah playing with a few different things
how important do you think your sales
ability is to this being successful to
someone or is it not that hard of a sale
it's not that hard of a sale to the to
the tree company if they don't like
their guy or they're renting or their
machine just went down like they just
need you there's been a few times where
I'm like oh that was that was me like I
showed up to their office they're like
oh yeah we use this guy and we're really
happy with them I hang out there for a
little bit and talk to them and by the
end they're like dude you know what like
we actually have a stump for you
tomorrow or whatever and those were
times that I used my sales ability but
for the most part it's a it's a pretty
easy sale okay and when it comes to a
tree triming business owner what type of
owner is most likely to use you is it
someone that's that owns a machine and
it keeps breaking down someone that
rents a machine someone that's already
Outsourcing it to your direct competitor
it's a mix between people that have
rented and just have never found a guy
they liked and that's tired of their sub

[25:00]
they liked and that's tired of their sub
and then I'll get called like emergency
wise When people's Grinders go down a
lot actually guys that have told me no
in the past they'll hit my you know
they'll call me and be like our
Grinder's down today can you pick this
up so that's that's great too how are
you doing the marketing do you have a
CRM do you have a Google sheet like how
are you tracking oh this is the tree
trimming company I want to Target I
followed up with them you know this many
times because that can you can keep it
in your head only so far and then at a
certain point you got to systematize it
I have a Google cheat I haven't put
anything into like a I would love to get
a full-blown hub spot built out for
myself eventually because that's always
what I use at the tech companies but
currently it's all on a Google sheet
with every text and email recorded that
I've sent to these people I'm starting
like some cold email stuff which has
actually worked really well because I
don't think anyone in the history has
marketed stump grinding through cold
email to tree contractors I really think
I'm I'm I'm breaking some ground there
and yeah I I don't know that it's that's
worked really well and what system are

[26:00]
worked really well and what system are
you using for job tracking invoicing
collections those types of things sheets
for all of that I don't use anything
else currently Chris I mean this is what
we talked about like that's what I love
about people like you and Tyler and and
these businesses you didn't spend the
time to like put up your your fancy CRM
you're not like okay I got to have high
level or I got to have jobber oh this is
my invoicing software like no dude I got
Google Sheets I've been reaching out to
people cuz I went in rped data and now I
have their contact information and you
just freaking went yeah those are all
friction to just actually launching the
thing yeah I I checked the other day
actually cuz someone asked me I had 30k
in Revenue before I ever had like a
website or domain or anything which was
awesome like I was like oh that's you
know that's pretty cool wow that's R so
you didn't have a website until October
yeah till like October yeah exactly was
it because you were like hesitant were
like I don't want to like commit to this
cuz I don't know if it's my thing yet or
were were you just like too busy to even
think about it yeah I was more on the

[27:00]
think about it yeah I was more on the
side of like busy I was like this is
working I don't really need more jobs
right now so let's just keep doing
what's working and then we'll figure
this out once it gets cold and a lot of
that's come since then so your average
job is 390 what does it look like is it
one stump three stumps do they get
discounts uh for multiple stumps my
average job is somewhere between one to
two stumps somewhere sitting there if
you if you take them all I did you know
20 stumps for a city and they were all
big stumps that was like a
$4,600 job and you know then you show up
for minimums my minimum is like 150 so
anything below a certain size is just
150 bucks is there any removal like are
you taking anything or is it you're just
grinding and leaving it about 70 to 80%
of my jobs are are grinding go is what
we call it so you grind you leave it in
a nice pile you tell the customer like
hey use this in your yard use this in
your mulch beds use this wherever it's
good stuff and then the other 20 30% are
like people that need it gone for some
reason or the other and that's why I do
have a dump trailer for that reason um I
don't have anything else to pick up the

[28:02]
don't have anything else to pick up the
mulch besides a shovel and a wheelbarrow
so those jobs are a lot less fun but I
do offer that and usually charge double
if I need to do that customer never
understands why it's double but it's
double because you have to go dump in
the middle of the day it's a lot harder
takes a lot longer it's just it's it's a
lot harder of a job I wonder if there's
any opportunity for that to to take the
mulch somewhere right like have a
relationship with a nursery or somewhere
that you can sell the mulch to after I
haven't figured out selling the mulch
but I found at least places where I can
dump for free at landscape yards which
has been nice it's better and and it's
closer than the dump is here so yeah
isn't there a company called like Mulch
Masters or something that like they're
like middleman between tree trimming
companies and consumers they like sell
mulch what what are they called I forgot
what they're called it's like chip drop
or something like that is yeah that's it
that's it is that not work for you so
Chip drops unique because they're kind
of what I have is mixed with dirt if

[29:01]
of what I have is mixed with dirt if
that makes sense oh okay a tree company
is chipping directly into the back of a
truck so pure wood chips mine is like a
little dirtier landscape yards will take
them though yeah what now I'm curious
that you said you listen to that
10-minute clip over and over and over
now we're six six months later now what
a in that 10-minute clip ended up just
not being very relevant or helpful and
what in that 10-minute clip was just
like gospel truth is still true today
yeah on the top end of like where this
could scale to like I'm not I don't want
to put a limit on myself but I remember
I think there are some numbers thr
around like this could be a you know
three four million do company it's hard
for me to see that a future of that ever
being the case even if you grow out
really smart it's just there's a lot of
other options people do own their own
machines big companies own their own
machines there's some limit to the
market size there uh but what was gospel
was you know grabbing list from out
scraper cold texting with a really
simple cold text and then just following
up from there and that's that's what I

[30:00]
up from there and that's that's what I
did I added a few like of my own unique
flare after every text I sent the day
after I would just send hey just
following up on this with like an up
arrow and a lot of people are
disorganized with their text so they see
a just following up on this they call me
instantly because they're like oh this
guy trying to give me business and then
I'll have them on the line like dude
what's up I'm a stump grinder and
they're like oh you could tell they're
like crap I shouldn't have called this
guy and yeah and then but I already have
them and so we build a relationship that
way so so I remember that three to four
million number and that was based on how
many tree trimming Crews there were in
Greater DFW which is like 950 and on
getting like 5% of them and I just
Googled like what the greater Provo or
Lehi Metro population is 733,000 so DFW
is exactly almost exactly 10 times more
than that do you think this could be a
three to $400,000 business if so then
three to four million in DFW could still
be accurate there you go 100% And to be
fair I do serve as Salt Lake County too
I serve as Salt Lake County less than I
serve as Utah County
so together between the two counties

[31:00]
so together between the two counties
it's like 1.7 million people is jez but
yeah no I think this could definitely be
a three to $400,000 company here for
sure I think it could be five six
700,000 no doubt I was just saying like
top level I'm like I don't know maybe it
could move to Dallas yeah there you go
exactly exactly it couldn't be that by
yourself but if you started getting
other people to to grind for you
absolutely then then potentially use
scale how do you view this business like
do you think this is the business
Tyler's going to be doing five years
from now or was this like a cool
experiment that is now giving you
confidence to become an entrepreneur and
do other things more in the bamp it will
be what I'm doing for the next few years
for sure what I consider it to be is a
cash heavy business that allows me to
learn business at a really really low
level of risk like really low now at
this point there's pretty much no risk
in my day-to-day and then I sit back and
I I do a ton to learn as much as I can
about other business models and do other

[32:01]
about other business models and do other
do other things outside of just stump
grinding now with that being said though
I do want to push and see where it can
go because what I do at that point where
I go pursue something maybe a little bit
bigger or that has some bigger Tam to it
than a than stump grinding what I do in
the next few years will decide what I do
with this business can I try to sell it
can I try to put my brother in you know
as as the owner operator or as an
operator and still take checks from the
the company there's a lot of options so
really most of my day-to-day is focused
on pushing it as far as I can but I do
think at some point I will want to move
to to something a little bit bigger I'm
like so tempted right now to just go
start this business it just sounds
awesome yeah I won't but it's fun here's
my question is if you were to wave a
magic wand and get every single tree
trimming business in your Market all 1.7
million people every tree trimming
business owner on the phone and give
them your best shot and then follow up
as you do with all of them what
percentage of them do you think you
could get as a customer it's a good

[33:01]
could get as a customer it's a good
question
probably 20 to 25% I think would be may
maybe 30% would be right around there
higher than I thought I really think I
could do 30% and you think 5 to 25 Grand
a year Topline from each of them is
realistic yes that it just depends on
the size but yes yeah there's some it
could even be bigger to be honest if you
get a huge company but those guys run
like two to three grinders and just
don't don't need me yeah
okay so let's let's be conservative here
because we know that there's about one
tree triming business for every 10,000
people so if you're in a city on an
island you know 100,000 people there's
going to be 10 Tree triing Business
businesses let's say that someone isn't
as good at selling as you and they can
only close 20% of them that's going to
be two let's say 5 to 25,000 per year
let's be conservative and say
$10,000 so theoretically in a city of
100,000 you would do $20,000 a year
Topline or does that sound like too low
like too conservative no that sounds

[34:00]
like too conservative no that sounds
about right yeah sounds about right how
many tree trimming companies are there
in the the 1.7 million I guess Metroplex
that you're operating in I don't have an
exact number I know my data scrap pulled
like 500
plus there's duplicates and stuff in
there too I remember Nick when we did
this research for tree trimming we
didn't like Provo because Dallas was one
in 10,000 Provo is one in 5,000 people
right yeah so was it good for you
there's less PR coverage to here than in
Dallas if you compare them directly
there there's a little there's a few
less trees here just a little bit drier
last question what is the exact making
model of your grinder and would you
recommend it to others Bandit 2550 yes I
would definitely recommend it to others
it's a great you have to get to a
certain amount of horsepower that you're
dangerous in the industry because if
you're at the low horsepower that people
could rent the same machine it's like
why would we do that you know what I
mean yeah but then there's there's top
levels that are way bigger than mine
that would be awesome to have they're

[35:01]
that would be awesome to have they're
just come with about double the price
point so it's a it's a great middle
ground but I always tell guys hey go
find the dealerships in your area
because there's four Brands and there's
really not always four dealerships for
each you know a brand for each
dealership in your area so dealership
support is important in stump grinding
because these things take a beating and
you're going to need you're going to
need to replace things on them so I
always tell people that what what advice
would you give to somebody who's
thinking about doing this in their local
market yeah I would tell them to go
listen to that first podcast I would
tell them to go listen to this and then
I can I shout other people's podcast on
here is that okay course yeah we'll
bleep it out okay yeah perfect perfect
say whatever you want it's not going be
there the yeah exactly Austin Gray he's
big on Twitter as well he runs owner
operator podcast he interviewed me there
and I we went really into detail about
like the the the small things in the
business because he runs a you know land
clearing heavy machinery business as
well so that's awesome and then I'll

[36:00]
well so that's awesome and then I'll
plug my own stuff I don't talk about
this at all but I do have a lot of of
course no not a community not a course
no no well I guess it is it is a
PDF There It Is Well okay it's kind of a
no keep going no it's I have gotten a
little bit of a following on Twitter so
I have a lot of people ask for uh phone
calls and stuff like that and one week I
think I hopped on like 15 phone calls
and I was like what am I doing with my
week and so I put together this 84 page
PDF it's it's like it's a no-brainer
price it's like $49 my average job's 390
so if you ever land a stump grinding job
you will pay for the PDF and that's what
i' i' I'd recommend too because I put
some stuff on there that's a lot of it's
from the original podcast with you Chris
but then there's a lot of like stump
grindy specific stuff on there that's
just super Niche Chris what percentage
did we get from that 89% we got 89 okay
cool exactly gumroad gets the another
five and then I I'm left with like four
and a half percent there it's perfect

[37:00]
and a half percent there it's perfect
yeah dude Tyler nice work man it is
