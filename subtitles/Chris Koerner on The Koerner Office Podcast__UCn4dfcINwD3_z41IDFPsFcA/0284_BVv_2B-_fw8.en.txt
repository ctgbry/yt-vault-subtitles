this is my friend Johnny he has a remote
house cleaning business that Nets him
$20,000 a month in profit that he gives
to his mom remote house cleaning can be
a great business but it is not without
its serious headaches the number one
problem that remote house cleaning
business owners have is that their
cleaners steal their customers in fact
Johnny told me that 50% of his cleaners
try to steal his customers but he has
one secret hack to stopping them in
their tracks as soon as he interviews
one that he might want to hire he sends
them to their first clean this is
actually a test clean but they don't
know that yet he'll call his friend and
say hey operation test clean is in
progress the cleaner shows up cleans the
house and then the owner AKA Johnny's
friend says listen this was really good
but how much would it cost if I just go
through you directly wink wink 50% of
the time they'll say all right listen
here's my cell phone number just call me
50% discount and the other half of the
time they say oh no no no I can't do
that I work for Johnny if they try to go
around him he fires him on the spot
