all right this video has me fired up and
let me tell you why business is more
than just multiplying a sales price by a
quantity I will use that same simple
math against the logic in this video
first of all at a 5% close rate you need
to speak to 8,000 people to sell 400
bottles of water second of all 400
bottles of water weigh 430 lb that's a
lot of weight plus you need ice and a
cooler third of all if you were to just
knock doors for 4 hours with a leaf
blower selling gutter cleaning for 250
bucks you could close at least 10 jobs
