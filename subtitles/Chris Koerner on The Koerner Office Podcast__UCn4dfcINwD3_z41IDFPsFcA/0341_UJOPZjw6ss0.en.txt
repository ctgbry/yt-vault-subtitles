have you ever wondered what happens to
all those pocket knives tools and random
items that the TSA confiscates at the
airport well I found the answer people
are making thousands off this website
every day these items get confiscated
and end up sitting in government
warehouses because well the government
doesn't know how to make a profit
obviously but we can this is day five of
my 10day series of showing you how to
make money on websites you've never
heard of so follow for the rest of them
this website lists all sorts of
government confiscated items and surplus
goods from pocket knives to cars to
boats real estate furniture and even
land at steep steep discounts 80 to 90%
off they just want it gone and that's
where we come in they don't care about
making money but we do go to this site
and set filters for your local area
Global marketplaces are efficient but
local marketplaces are inefficient but
you're looking for big items that are
expensive to ship that's how you find
the best deal Furniture office supplies
Machinery tools Vehicles those have much
less bidder so you can swoop in and grab
them at a fraction of their retail price
the site I'm talking about is
govdeals.com get 14 more sites just like
this right here
