look at this freaking thing right here I
was walking down Broadway in Nashville
and I saw this store i' never seen
anything like it so I had to reverse
engineer how much money it makes per
year let's see if this is a cash cow or
a dud first of all their overhead is
about $1,000 a day I know this because
they have four employees they're
probably paid about $20 per hour each
after you include payroll taxes they're
open 8 hours a day every day so that's
$80 an hour times 8 hours a day $640 a
day in labor it's about $120 a day in
rent because I know it's about 800 feet
and they have $45 per square foot rent
so that's about $33,000 a month and then
you've got utilities internet called
1,000 bucks a day overhead now they
charge between $35 and $200 for a
bracelet you can even custom make your
own bracelets or buy pre-made bracelets
that means just to break even they need
to sell about 30 bracelets a day now
some days are probably slammed right now
they're doing okay some days they're
probably empty is this a cash cow or a
dud I think it's a dud
