look at this freaking thing right there
that's your next business idea no I'm
not talking about a grat Clips franchise
I used to own a chain of retail iPhone
repair shops four of them and every now
and then I'd have a light go out and my
channel letter are signed and if I let
it stay dead for long enough inevitably
I'd get a call from one to two different
sign companies offering to fix it and
this is what's called a no-brainer offer
because they know 100% that I need that
sign fixed it's not a cold call it's a
very warm call so you don't own a sign
company but you can start a business
doing this you can rent a bucket truck
for about 400 bucks a day those cost
about $300 a letter to fix and usually
it's just a dead bulb so here's what you
do you go drive around town at night you
write down a list of all the stores that
have dead bulbs in their Channel letter
signs you call them all up and you offer
300 bucks to come fix it you line up 10
repairs in the same night that's 3,000
bucks you pay 400 bucks to rent the
bucket truck you don't need to buy it do
that once a week and you're making
$3,000 a week about 2,000 of that is net
profit get the full business plan right
