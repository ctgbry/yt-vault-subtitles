all right all right welcome to episode
10 of the Kerner office this is
it first question started a gutter
cleaning business on the side in late
February what's the best ways to find
jobs and grow in the early stages so
this is a long-standing question of any
startup owner right how do I get my
first jobs in the early stages and I
think there's an overarching principle
here that people are willing to
acknowledge and that is pride pride SL
ego is at the core of everything we do
or don't do whether we're willing to
admit that or not so if I'm getting
asked a question like this about
starting a gutter cleaning business
pressure washing home detailing
lawnmowing whatever it is these are all
things that our friends and family get
done on a regular basis which means that
our customers should not be hard to find
the hard part is putting our Pride asde

[01:00]
the hard part is putting our Pride asde
to go ask them to go ask them hey can
you pay me to do this job for you but
there's an easy and a hard way of asking
people this awkward stuff I'm the king
of anti- awward I hate awkward I hate it
I hate it I hate it but there's a way to
do this right and so if I were this guy
with a gutter cleaning company I would
get my friends and family on the phone
one by one I would not text them and say
hey I just started this new business I
I'm just testing right now I just want
to see if I'm any good right I I want to
clean gutters I think this could be
something I could scale but I need some
testimonials would you allow me to clean
your gutters at half off 20% off 30% off
whatever and just get those first few
jobs and then once you have the jobs
they're going to love it this seems like
a very kind of binary outcome type
business they can't even see inside the
gutter so as far as they know you did a
great job then just ask for referrals
and I tweeted about this a while ago but
there's a guy I spoke to in Australia
that started what is now an $8 million

[02:01]
that started what is now an $8 million
window washing company and he only
started with his friends and family
that's it and it just snowballed from
there word of mouth because every person
knows three to 400 other people and if
they're willing to give referrals to 1%
of those three to 400 other people then
every one of your 20 friends can refer
60 friends can refer 180 friends so on
and so forth right so the long-winded
answer to your question is put your
pride aside first because I'm betting
you're not here to you're not here to
clarify but I'm betting that you haven't
truly exhausted your circle friends and
family so do that first and then ask for
referrals shamelessly ask for referrals
if you did a good job why wouldn't you
all right next
question gig economy for a person just
starting out in the gig economy and for
those unfamiliar just freelance work
right what software is recommended to
create and track small invoices and take
care of the little bookkeeping
QuickBooks are zero zero is an e books

[03:01]
QuickBooks are zero zero is an e books
is great from a dollar in Revenue to
$100 million in Revenue it integrates
with your bank accounts um it's just it
it's simple or or just use Google Sheets
or Excel good on you for asking this
question early on it's not something I
usually ask until a few months in when
it's already really messy but don't
overthink it I don't know of any other
kind of magic cool hacks Chrome
extensions or tools but zero and and
QuickBooks both do the job really well
next question
like everyone else our business depends
on sales and I'm really worried that one
day the sales will just stop like at the
moment I have four quotes with four
different companies out I need at least
two of them to come in if none of them
come in then I have a problem man I'm
freaked out just reading this this
honestly this goes back to Pride what I
was just talking about Pride can also be
not being willing to do Outreach okay
one of my favorite pastimes is jugging

[04:02]
one of my favorite pastimes is jugging
for catfish and trot lining okay now
jugging is something that most people
have never heard of it is when you take
pool noodles or milk jugs or 2 lit
bottles whatever you tie a string to it
that's 2 to 6 feet long you put a hook
and then you put bait on it and then you
take a boat you take it out in a lake
and you drop these pool noodles all over
the like 20 30 40 50 of them and then
you just watch for them to start bobbing
up and down and it is the funnest thing
ever and I really want to do it in the
ocean because I think that would be even
funner because you don't know what
you're going to pull up trot line is
similar you'll find like an Eddy or like
a small River or creek leading into a
lake and you'll take this 30 40 50 foot
line that has hooks every foot or so and
you'll bait all the hooks and you'll
anchor each end of the line near the
bottom and then you'll come back the
next day or the next morning and you've
got a bunch of catfish it's like the

[05:00]
got a bunch of catfish it's like the
most redneck amazing sport ever okay why
am I talking about this because you
should not be paranoid that the money
faucet will turn off because you always
need to have hooks in the water if
you're telling me that you have four
quotes out if none of them come in you
have a problem that's a problem because
the statistical probability of none of
those working out is pretty good so
there's a pretty good chance that you
have a pretty big problem on your hands
right now and I'm betting that's because
you've gotten complacent you're relying
on inbound right word of mouth if it's
not broke don't fix it that is wrong you
need to have a lot of hooks in the water
what are those hooks in the water it
could be your gmbb profile it could be
asking for reviews it could be a cold
email campaign that's always running on
autopilot a cold text campaign that's
always running out on autopilot it could
be a ringless voicemail campaign it
could be mailers it could could be door

[06:00]
could be mailers it could could be door
knocking it could be door hangers what
you got to have hooks in the water if
you have four quotes out it could make
or break your business then you're not
consistently doing cold outbound it
could be Facebook ads Google ads Etsy
ads I don't care you've got to have a
bunch of hooks in the water and magical
things will happen so don't rely on
inbound don't even rely on seo seo is
changing as we know it put more hooks in
the water and you won't be as paranoid
all right next one looking for a
technical co-founder skilled in react
web stack so you need to go where these
guys hang out and these guys hang out on
Twitter Reddit specific subreddits and
Indie hackers and Hacker News you got to
go start building a reputation and a
community there start commenting on
people's stuff start posting your own
stuff those are the best guys to
co-found projects with you likely don't
know anyone in your immediate circle
that would be a good fit for this and
frankly if you're co-found a business

[07:00]
frankly if you're co-found a business
with them you might would be better
served finding a stranger on the
internet I there's a lot of really
interesting ways to structure businesses
nowadays sharing a stripe account and
just splitting what comes into that
stripe account it's
trustless and it it can work really well
but yeah I honestly I would just go to
Indie hackers and start hanging out
there and seeing what people are posting
about and dming them or commenting
beneath them and hopping on calls with
them and going from there yeah or
honestly the more I think about it why
not just post to upwork looking for a
guy in Bangladesh that can that you can
pay to do some work for you and then if
he does a great job and he's really
responsive and hardworking and then make
him your co-founder who said you can't
find co-founders off upwork that's what
I would do all right next
question how can I find and retain
Rockstar employees in a business with
small margins

[08:00]
small margins
I love this question because I live this
question I have picked the stupidest
hardest business Industries in my life
and I regret many of them but it's made
me hardened and it's made me have to get
creative and it's made me qualified to
give advice to questions like
these so I had a company called sende
deeds and we were an e-commerce
fulfillment brand and that is a brutal
business it was called PPS pickpack and
ship that's what the industry term is
people would send us a pallet full of
goods and then we would connect our API
to their Shopify store and then as
orders would come in we would pick pack
and ship them out for them you make
money by marking up shipping you make
money every time you pick an item and
pack it and ship it out you make money
on storage yada yada but it is just such
a brutal business and we are competing
with Amazon right one of the biggest
companies in the world and there are
some Industries like 3ep third party

[09:00]
some Industries like 3ep third party
Logistics where the messy middle is very
big the messy middle exists everywhere
and that is it's the size of a business
where you're too small to be good enough
for X but you're too big to be good
enough for y and so in e-commerce
fulfillment 3pl you either have to be
small Niche very
expensive or you have to be Amazon and
have billions of dollars worth of
Automation and equipment and be
affordable so we were in the messy
middle we had we were like a four five
$6 million Topline company not enough to
buy automation equipment but too big to
really not Niche enough to charge a
bunch of money you've got to be in the
right industry too we were in food send
eats first of all it's just a terrible
category because there's not a lot of
food shipped online period people think
there is there's not okay we would take
these customers that were big household
name brands online orders were a

[10:01]
name brands online orders were a
fraction of a fraction of a percent of
their in store sales and so it's not a
big category and it's not a high margin
category as opposed to like supplements
that are small they're shippable most of
them are shelf stable and they have 80
to 90% gross margins so if we would have
been a supplement 3pl we could have been
a lot more expensive because the margins
are there on our customer side to
justify those fees
but we weren't we were in the messy
middle and so what we had to do was get
really creative in our hiring we were
competing with Amazon 23 fulfillment
centers in DFW and they pay 17 or $18 an
hour and we pay 12 to 13 to an hour how
do you compete with that we had culture
we let them listen to podcast on their
airpods and that sounds like not a
luxury at all but in that space it is we
let them play music over the
loudspeakers for everyone to hear we let
them choose their music we played games

[11:01]
them choose their music we played games
with them we gave them free lunch every
week these things that seem so basic to
most corporations were not at all at
this wage level in this industry so
these small things that we did had a t
to1 ratio of cost to Value right if if
you were to say what if you were to have
a perk to your employees where hey if
you get to work here we'll give you an
extra 50 bucks a month okay thank you so
much sir uh wow thank you so much that's
nothing that's no value but if you were
to say hey for everyone that works here
we'll pay for all of your subscriptions
Hulu all of your media subscriptions
Hulu YouTube premium and Netflix huh
that's cool that might only cost us 50
bucks but the value of that is much much
more than $50 so we were forced to think
of creative ways to offer value to our
employees that you know to offer perks
to our employees that were much more
valuable than the actual cost of them so

[12:01]
valuable than the actual cost of them so
if you are in a business with small
margins and you're a jerk or it's not a
great place to work or the manager is a
jerk you're not going to make it you got
to have a cool culture you got to have
some cool Perks at least cool for the
industry and you got to get creative
another thing I would say is if you
can't hire a rockstar employee then you
have to build Rockstar employees you
have to be the one to take someone that
shows promise but that is still
affordable to you and mold them into
what becomes a rockstar
employee that's something that I've had
to do over and over not even because I'm
in low margin Industries but because a
lot of times I'm just like I have a hard
time wrapping my mind around paying
people so much money and so instead of
paying someone that's been in the
industry for 10 years and is worth 180
Grand I'll bu someone brand new that
looks like they'll be worth 180 or 280
Grand in a few years pay them market

[13:02]
Grand in a few years pay them market
rate and try to get them to that point
it takes more work takes more headache
they're going to be rough around the
edges you're going to be frustrated a
lot of the time but Beggars can't be
choosers right this is the industry you
chose it's not a high margin industry
then yeah you got to offer these little
perks it's got to be a fun place to work
or you have to build them into Rockstar
employees next question how can I raise
money in this tough economy all right
been here I hate the saying oh man
there's so much dry powder oh there's
dry powder on the sidelines oh dry
powder dry there's so much there's so
much money out there great great for you
okay that's great for you but it's not
like that for everyone and that is a
very subjective thing that I think a lot
of people say just because they hear a
lot of other people saying it but
they're not actually experiencing it
firsthand for instance in real estate if
you already have a fund and if you
already have a track record and if that
track record is good then a lot of that
dry powder finds you really attractive

[14:01]
dry powder finds you really attractive
and it's fairly easy to raise funds for
Real Estate projects if you're brand new
in real estate if you don't have a track
record or if your track record is subpar
that it's not the dry powder suddenly
becomes dumb money and they want to give
it to you anyway because they just need
somewhere to put their money you got to
fight for it you got to work for it back
to Pride you got to set your pride aside
and ask friends and family for money or
you got to pick a different idea there
are so many ideas today that don't
require any money a service business go
to YouTube develop a skill and start a
service business that you can charge
$500 to $5,000 a month for if you're
having trouble raising capital for an
idea then either keep working at it ask
people that you're uncomfortable asking
that know you and trust you as a person
or pick a different idea that doesn't
need as much money next I'm thinking
about how do I increase predictable cash
flow what traffic channels can I use
that are are free and relatively easy to

[15:00]
that are are free and relatively easy to
implement or have the highest return on
time at what point should I hire a VA if
you're unsure about cash flow how do you
know if you can hire someone so the most
high leverage activity you can do to
make your cash flow more predictable is
to create a personal brand online and
I'm not just saying that because that's
what I'm trying to do I'm saying that
because that's what I've done recently
and it has opened my eyes to how
powerful it can be whatever your Niche
is you need to acquire targeted email
addresses in that Niche and you need to
start sending them a ton of value every
single week email is the one channel
that cannot be taken away from you
unlike any other social media channel it
is the most valuable if you take Tik Tok
Instagram YouTube Twitter all of them
email is the most valuable so you need
to start finding email addresses in your
Niche and you need to start sending them
a free value and you need to be patient
enough to spend months doing this or
years because it will take a long time
if you want predictability this is what

[16:01]
if you want predictability this is what
it's going to take once you have that
then you can start selling products and
services to that Niche through your
email list and it will become
predictable for instance my company
Texas snacks where we resell Bucky stuff
we have an email list of 130,000 people
I know for a fact if I hit send on an
email to all of them it's going to
generate about $12,000 in sales
sometimes a lot more sometimes less
depends on the item if it's a niche item
May maybe 6,000 if it's a seasonal item
hard to find item maybe 25,000 but on
average I could expect 12 Grand from
hitting send it on email that's
incredibly predictable but it took four
year four years to build that email list
and so if you want predictable get an
email list the second part of your
question was around at what point should
I hire a VA you should hire a VA a
virtual assistant as in someone that
works overseas for you at a highly
reduced rate compared to our rates here
in the US when you're swamped you just

[17:00]
in the US when you're swamped you just
can't you're swamped with tasks and
you're swamped with Revenue right that's
when you want to hire a VA when you feel
like you don't have any choice but to
die of stress or hire not just a VA but
an employee anyone I see people make the
mistake of hiring too early a lot more
than hiring too late uh unless you're
doing something incredibly complex it
shouldn't take too long to offload your
brain into someone else especially with
Loom that's what I do I I click on loom
and I'll spend 7 to 15 minutes making a
loom and we're good and that Loom will
exist forever and they can refer back to
it at any given point so I need to
figure out how to get my product from
China to the USA I have worked with
Customs Brokers before but the cost has
gotten crazy hoping to figure out a way
to navigate it myself or at least get a
better deal so I've done this quite a
bit I've imported a lot of crap from
China you need to to ask your vendors

[18:00]
China you need to to ask your vendors
for a broker referral and you're
specifically looking for Brokers that
will charge a percentage basis on
everything you order so I like to find
One-Stop shops in China where I can find
a guy that can negotiate shipping he can
manage all the Customs for me and he can
even help me find more affordable
vendors and so he is more than worth his
2 three four five 6% fee right so let's
say we're doing this buying iPhone parts
from China I'm going to go find vendors
on AliExpress or Alibaba I'm going to DM
20 of them I'm going to find a few
vendors I'm going to start getting
samples from them I'm G to find some
that I like I'm going to narrow it down
to three or four and then I'm G to ask
them do you know any Brokers that I can
use to help with Customs they're going
to refer you some Brokers and then
you're going to go to them and say hey I
know I asked about Customs help can you
also help with sourcing other vendors I
want as many vendors as I can have
because that means I'm going to get a
bit price find a onop shop and ask them

[19:01]
bit price find a onop shop and ask them
specifically can I pay you a percentage
of everything I order and at this point
you already know what the market prices
are so they can't really rip you off it
can get tricky if market prices drop and
your broker eats that margin it doesn't
pass it on to you which is why you want
multiple Brokers preferably two or three
and definitely multiple vendors so you
can compare prices between each vendor
but yeah find find a One-Stop shop get a
referral from your vendor in China and
they will surely know someone and just
make it very clear to them that you want
them to manage everything all the forms
all the duties um pricing sourcing
everything to where you can just place
an order and receive it at your
Warehouse do I double down on Leen for
my current business that has
consistently done pretty well but is
exhausting or shift gears into a side
business that I enjoy more or keep both
all right I'm going to read something

[20:01]
all right I'm going to read something
here I just tweeted about this and I'm
going to read it to you here is the
Tweet says I want to start a side Hustle
but I don't think I have the time yes
you do if your side hustle works you'll
find the time if it doesn't you won't
and that is your answer but you can't
get the answer until you launch until
you act do I triple down on my current
business or chase another one the fact
that you're even asking that means you
need to find out chase that rabbit to
find the answer shiny object syndrome is
a feature not a bug you wouldn't have
the thought if your current business was
crushing it what's the difference
between spotting New Opportunities
within your current Biz versus a New Biz
all that matters is that you keep moving
that you stay in the game compounding
doesn't care either way compounding
rewards endurance not focus that's my
answer I would say that you need to
chase that rabbit and see if this other
idea has any promise has any Merit

[21:01]
idea has any promise has any Merit
there's a chance that other idea makes
your current idea look stupid in
comparison if I never chased rabbits I'd
still be banging my head against the
wall trying to make the third party
Logistics business work and trying to
get my net margin from four to 5% I'm so
grateful that I was distracted enough to
see better opportunities that were in
front of me because I was looking that's
what I would do next question I am in
the ideation phase and the thing that
keeps me up is how how much risk can I
take on to start something I have a job
for now but it is uncertain at the
moment I have cash to invest but I don't
know how long my job search will suck my
savings I think I want to follow the
advice of starting it well at a job I
love to say the phrase test everything
except drugs okay you don't count on
your job search yielding anything okay
because the job market is all over the
map right now if I were you I would I

[22:01]
map right now if I were you I would I
talked about this in the previous
episode listen to the wing Walkers code
right the guys that walk on the wings of
airplanes they don't let go of a railing
until they're holding on to another one
use this opportunity while you're still
employed to test all kinds of different
startup ideas Home Service SAS look at
acquiring a small business test all of
them as many as you can at the same time
until you get to that point where it's
this is a win or this is not a win
that's what I would do next question I
lost a lot of sleep last night since
taxes were due basically I'm working a
day job while also have a small business
and investment income I'm very happy
with how much my business has grown in
the last year but after seeing how much
I owee in taxes I'm a little discouraged
any advice I have friends and family who
made more money than I did last year but
aren't having to pay as much as I do
some are even getting a refund back I
really don't have anyone to talk to or
advice from first of all just because

[23:01]
advice from first of all just because
they're getting a refund back doesn't
mean they're paying less in taxes than
you it means they were paying taxes all
year and then they overpaid a little bit
and so they're getting that overpayment
back it means they gave the government a
free loan and you did not right now in
small business you should be paying
estimated taxes quarterly and then at
the end of the year if you didn't pay
enough then you'll have to pay more if
you pay too much then you'll get a
little bit of back but it's apples and
oranges to compare how a W2 employee
pays taxes and how someone who
self-employed pays taxes but I wouldn't
be down on your luck or feel like you're
down on your luck or losing sleep or
bummed out because it seems like you're
having to pay more in taxes than anyone
else I would feel privileged that you
have the skills to enable you to be a
small business owner because that means
you have unlimited upside okay so think
about it this way the people that you're
comparing yourself to have a very low SE
steing the chance of them becoming a

[24:01]
steing the chance of them becoming a
millionaire from a W2 income is quite
low compared to being self-employed so
stop comparing yourself to them compare
yourself to other business owners or to
no one I'm not a tax guy I'm actually
quite terrible at taxes I have a tax guy
you got to find a tax guy you got to
find someone that you know and trust
that can give you actual good advice
regarding taxes but I can give you the
advice to stop comparing yourself to
someone with a W2 cuz it's not the same
thing all right next question I've been
a college coach for the bulk of my 20s
and 30s and growing tired of the field
long hours poor financial incentives and
administrative Hoops are really taking a
toll on what has been a great career
I've changed a lot of lives and won some
rings along the way I just turned 40 and
I'm thinking about a career change to
entrepreneurship any large sports team
is like a company my current one
involves over 100 people directly
involved between athletes staff and
support we raise capital have tactics
and sell like crazy I'm the CEO of my

[25:01]
and sell like crazy I'm the CEO of my
team What fields and opportunities do
you think are best suited for someone
like me wanting to get out of Collegiate
Sports have you seen this pathway before
I've never owned a business but have
ham-fistedly executed a few ideas with
friends and family my schedule has been
so tough in the past to really work on
anything meaningful outside of my field
I understand hard work in problem
solving what should I do so I love this
question I think the carryover between
what you're doing and what small small
businesses do is there I think that you
are perfectly suited for a home service
business because those are people
businesses first and foremost if you're
motivating a team recruiting executing
on a plan you probably have great
systems and processes you're probably
quite organized and I think that would
make you a perfect candidate to start a
local in-person business I would not
suggest real estate because that's it's
lonely it takes a lot of capital and
it's not really a peoplehey business as

[26:00]
it's not really a peoplehey business as
far as like recruiting and organizing
motivating a team and I don't recommend
software or anything virtual or content
facing either for the same reasons so I
would go back to those ideas that you
have launched on and executed with
friends and family make a big list of
what you loved about that process and
what you hated about it write down all
of your best memories from that and what
your worst memories were put them side
by side and howy toine commonalities and
then use something like chat GPT to
brainstorm ideas on what verticals you
could get into maybe it's Landscaping
maybe it's Roofing I think that being
that involved in your community means
that you're in a perfect position to
start your business on the backs of
referrals I think it should be pretty
easy for you to find uh your first batch
of jobs as I'm talking I feel like it
shouldn't be something like Roofing or
pools because that's more Niche and
you're not going to get as many
referrals because most people don't need
a new roof or a pool at any given time

[27:01]
a new roof or a pool at any given time
but I would do something more broad
something like fencing or house painting
cement work stuff like that I think
you'll find success there next question
looking into a carpet and floor care
business what are your opinions on this
it seems to be a non-recurring business
but maybe Implement some recurring
aspect to it I don't like the idea of
implementing a recurring aspect to a
business that doesn't naturally have it
because that's just a pie in the sky
hope idea and I feel like if there were
a recurring aspect to the flooring
industry then it would already be there
and someone smart would have already
thought of it and be implementing it and
then everyone else would be copying them
sure you could try to hope to get
creative and have a floor cleaning
service or something like that where you
Outsource it or sub it out to another
company but I would just throw that away
altogether it sounds like you're looking
to buy one as opposed to starting one I
think they're great businesses to buy I
think it's a very typical Boomer own

[28:00]
think it's a very typical Boomer own
business that are undercharging not
marketing relying on Word of Mouth and
inbound stuff I would not start it I
would never start this business unless
it could be the type of business like
our tree triming business where you're
just a Leen Factory and you're subbing
everything out to an actual crew in that
case I do like it but I don't like the
idea of opening a store and buying a
bunch of inventory when you could do
another home service opportunity that
could be as much if not much more big or
profitable without all that
overhead next question when when
providing leads to businesses how do you
validate that they were successful
asking them to tell you how much to
charge them seems like an easy way for
them to undercount I love this question
so I assume what this gentleman Abraham
is asking is let's say he's doing leg
gen for the legal industry and he's
asking all right let's say I get a car
crash lead do I sell that for 100 bucks
50 bucks do I take a percentage of the
revenue if it closes there are pros and

[29:01]
revenue if it closes there are pros and
cons to all of these but if you're
starting from scratch I love the idea of
starting really cheap and getting your
customers being the actual business that
you're selling the leads to getting them
addicted to your leads right ensuring
that they have a 20 to 50x Roi on your
leads because that is an insane Roi get
them to the point where they are calling
you hey what what's going to take to get
more leads ohy you got more those leads
that means you have them in the palm of
your hand that means you have the
leverage that means you can charge
whatever you want you can raise the
prices to whatever you want or you can
keep the price the same and sell the
same lead to multiple people of course I
suggest that you actually disclose that
or else you're in for a lot of hurt but
it doesn't don't worry about how to
track if the lead closes be just worry
about finding customers that will buy
these leads first because you don't know
if these leads are good yet you don't
yet know what the close rate is is if
it's a 5% close rate that looks much

[30:00]
it's a 5% close rate that looks much
different than a 50% close rate so just
sell them at Rock Bottom price but be
maniacal about following up with your
clients on how the leads are going have
a shared Google sheet like pester them
to death about updating it you're not
going to be motivated to keep sending
leads and they're not like it's just it
doesn't work if they're not keeping a
Google sheet updated that actually tells
you how well those leads are closing or
not all right folks that is the episode
today it was a little shorter than
normal and that's something else that
I'm testing right now I really want the
retention of these episodes to stay high
so I feel like if I can shorten them a
little bit pack in a bunch more
questions hopefully a bunch more value
then the likelihood of you listening to
the very end will be much higher so I'm
testing two things today only pres
submitted questions and a little shorter
of an episode and I would love love love
your feedback you can email me Chrisco
founders.com no - justchris co-founders
decom please give me your feedback I

[31:01]
decom please give me your feedback I
want to know would you prefer to hear
the voices of the callers do you love
the back and forth where I just ask them
a ton of questions does that really add
to it or is it better for me to just
read one to four sentences that outlines
the question and then answers it and
then answer it so let me know what you
think uh thanks for joining uh episode
10 and we will see you next week
