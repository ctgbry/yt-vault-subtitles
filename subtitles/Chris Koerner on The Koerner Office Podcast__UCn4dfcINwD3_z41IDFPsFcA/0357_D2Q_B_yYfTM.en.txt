if you're into business or real estate
this 30second analogy can make you a lot
of money don't just fish where it's wet
fish where you can see Fish here's what
I mean by that I've got a friend that
owns a pond cleaning business he goes
door Todo but he only knocks door of
homes that have big ponds got another
friend that sells security systems door
Todo he only knocks on houses that have
a sign out front that says guarded by a
security system I also interviewed a guy
that does line
striping a lot like that and he only
knocks on doors that have parking lot
that need new lines painted they're
fishing where they can see the fish
they're not just knocking on doors
blindly I'm sitting here charging my car
be here for 30 minutes and if someone
were to pitch me their startup or real
estate idea as I sit here I might just
invest in them because the chance that
someone charging their car here can also
afford to invest in a business or real
estate project is very high follow me
for more ideas like these
