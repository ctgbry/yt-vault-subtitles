if you have ever even thought about
starting a bounce house rental business
then today is your lucky day I'm going
to dive deep on the bounce house rental
business and how you can spend 1,600 one
time and then make 1,600 in profit every
month for just a few hours worth of work
today is a deep dive on the bounce house
rental business how you can start it as
a side hustle and keep it as a side
hustle or you can start it as a side
hustle and scale it into something big
and profitable this could be a seven or
eight figure business if you really want
to go crazy with it so listen up you're
going to love it
welcome to the Kerner office this is
Chris kerer and I'm going to do
something a little different today so
obviously I have these deep Dives where
I interview someone maybe is a fuel
delivery business maybe it's a sleep
Consulting business a line striping
business you get the idea and it's cool
because you get to hear from a business
owner from the source directly what it's
like it's cool it's great I love it
hopefully you love it but I wanted to
try something different what if I did a
deep dive without a guest where I spent
a bunch of hours visiting a business in
an industry or speaking with a business
owner in an industry or looking up data

[01:01]
owner in an industry or looking up data
on perplexity or online and just diving
deep about everything there is to know
about that industry how people are
growth hacking it how they're making
money unique Concepts I'm seeing within
the industry and then I just come back
and report it at all just me and you
that's what I want to try today and
please let me know in the comments if
you like it it's kind of crazy I put
these episodes out there that thousands
of people listen to and then like two
people will reach out and say I liked it
or I didn't like it Chris at co-founders
decom if you're on Apple you can't
really comment if you're on Spotify you
can comment but you can always email me
if you DM me I probably will not see it
but let me know what you think of this
style so today I'm going to do the
bounce house business why the bounce
house business well for starters I love
the business I just love it you can
spend 1,500 bucks on a commercial bounce
house and you can rent that sucker out
for 400 bucks for half a day one day a
week 3 days a week whatever you can get
your money back in the first month and
all you need is a van like even a
minivan or a trailer or a truck
something I mean these things weigh

[02:00]
something I mean these things weigh
80 to 250 lbs and they're big they take
up a lot of space you need a dolly you
need to STP them down so you can't just
put them in a Prius but you can put a
hitch on your Prius and then put a
trailer on your Prius and pull it around
anyway I love this industry I've always
loved it one of my first viral tweets
was about this industry and I just spent
three hours with a bounce house business
owner two days ago because I'm starting
to film more I don't know what they're
called there's probably a word for it
but out and about Style YouTube videos
where I
think of it like dirty jobs right where
I go out there I'm with the business
owner I'm but it's like dirty jobs but
for the business-minded right or diners
Drive-In and Dives but for the
business-minded so in diners Drive-In
and Dives he says what's your best
recipe chicken fried steak show me how
you make it exactly oh okay and it's
really good content because Guy Fetti
know like he's been in the restaurant
industry forever and so he speaks the
language and he can recognize things and
he can cross associate things and so

[03:00]
he can cross associate things and so
he's entertaining but it's also really
good content cuz he's knowledgeable and
you're getting an inside look behind the
curtain that most people never see so
he's like oh you use white pepper
because the black pepper is too strong
when mixed with the cardamom or whatever
like he just knows what the chefs and
business owners are doing so it makes
for good content so I'm hopeful that if
I do segments or episodes similar to
those where I'm actually on site but
instead of asking about the recipe I'm
asking about the marketing channels I
hope and think that'll be good content
anyway let's do this let's dive in I'm
going to start by doing something a
little different I'm going to read that
first viral tweet that I had about the
industry and then I'm going to fact
check myself and correct myself because
I didn't know much of anything about
this industry when I first put that out
there and now I know somewhat a little
bit about it so let's start with that
and then I'm going to correct any
inaccuracies that may exist and I
haven't read this in like over a year I
didn't even prep for this interview so
we'll see how this goes and then I'm
going to tell you about everything I
just learned about how you can start

[04:00]
just learned about how you can start
this business and is the industry
growing is it shrinking is it a good
business is it too much of a headache
for what it's worth let's go let's dive
into it where's everyone making millions
on bounce house rentals I've already had
150 milligrams of caffeine so let's
knock this out real fast here's how I
launch this business in DFW bounce house
rentals is an awesome business because
low overhead built-in referral marketing
High margins scale fast with low Capital
risk plenty of cheap labor side hustle
that can scale start by using card c a
Rd to whip up a $9 site with these
plugins scheduling and stripe what's
your business name keep it simple start
with your city's name Allen Texas is a
quintessential American suburb middle
class young 100,000 people so we'll use
this for our example Allen bounce house
rentals very original right hyper local
and good for SEO go to eBay and find
three different bounce houses in the
$500 to $1,500 range one boy themed one
girl themed one neutral find some
reputable sellers with plenty of
inventory look for the best sellers best

[05:00]
inventory look for the best sellers best
sellers equal easier to rent you can
filter for all this stuff don't just buy
any of them just yet find some
screenshots of these three bounce houses
and put them on your card site before
you ever buy one price them as such $300
for 4 hours $400 for 8 hours free
delivery and pickup yes stupidly cheap
we'll change this later who wouldn't pay
$300 to entertain 30 kids for 4 hours
you don't want huge fcy bounce houses
where you need an attendant to stay in
babysit you can't afford that and you're
dropping these things off keep them
simple at first go to YouTube and find
the SMB small to mediumsized business
Bounce House Rabbit Hole spend hours
learning the tricks of the trade and the
lingo learn what pitfalls to watch out
for because guess what I've never
started a bounce house Biz who cares
though neither have you and you'll crush
it now before you collect a dime go get
some insurance where to get insurance I
don't know Google bounce house rental
insurance get yourself covered then use
chat gbt to make a liability waiver and
upload it to Doc you signed be sure the
contract is super strict no more than x
kids at a time you must be watching them
at all times you aren't liable for
anything Etc by the way I'm not a lawyer

[06:01]
anything Etc by the way I'm not a lawyer
this is freaking Twitter and I'm
oversimplifying probably get a lawyer to
look over the contract back to your
website leave wide open availability on
your calendar starting three weeks out
three rental slots deep per time frame
why you want to oversell your spaces
this gives you a valid reason to buy
more than one of each Bounce House
you'll pay for each house on two to four
rentals also you want to charge $50 for
someone to book the time slot get their
email and MailChimp with an automated
link to pay the remainder a week before
the res a date charging only $50 to book
reduces friction of charging 100%
upfront while removing most cancellation
risk give yourself a 2hour window to
drop off and pick up don't have a truck
pay U-Haul $200 to add your hitch to
your car and buy a $1,000 trailer on
Craigslist not rocket science now time
to get some customers this is the fun
part remember stories sell better than
products join every local Facebook group
you can find and sell your personal
story maybe you're still in high school
or college earning money for school
maybe maybe you have a full-time job

[07:00]
maybe maybe you have a full-time job
doing this on the nights and weekends
maybe you're saving your a kids college
if you don't have a cool story then
event one find the mom's group on
Facebook remember moms are your
customers not dads or kids there's a ton
of local mom Facebook groups sell them a
discount reach out to the admin and
offer referal code to tell them you're
you're young and hungry also post ads in
Facebook Marketplace everywhere
Craigslist same same post ads everywhere
your phone Marine get these first few
jobs when you do start buying the bounce
houses good thing you found ones from
reputable sellers with plenty of stock
once they arrive set them up in your
backyard and check for leaks and learn
their quirks learn how to collapse them
quickly buy a heavy duty Dolly to make
to move them to and from your trailer
now for the built-in referral marketing
go online and buy some huge freaking
vinyl signs to attach to the top of
every bounce house you buy Allen bounous
rentals.com all caps also put a QR code
they will pop up over the privacy fences
everyone in Allen has a privacy fence
for all passers by to see but you're not
done go buy a bunch of $25 Amazon
physical gift cards when you go pick up

[08:01]
physical gift cards when you go pick up
the bounce houses offer a gift card
right there on the spot if the mom posts
a pick a testimonial and a link to your
site to her facebookinstagram page have
her show it to you and tag your business
Facebook page be goofy about it not
pressuring this $100 will pay off 10x
call slowing down get bandit signs I
talk all about them in my thread here
now your phone won't stop ringing why
localized to one city only because
driving also it's much easier to sell to
those residents now prove them model and
either change your name copy paste your
card site and make Plano bounous
rentals.com and grow by the way you can
literally copy and paste a card site
with one click these jobs mostly won't
be during school hours so hire high
schoolers for $15 an hour this is
scalable and if you don't want to scale
then make 100K every summer as you grow
you can buy bigger and better bounce
houses there are 37,000 households in
Allen so you're telling me that 1 to 2%
of them won't rent a bounce house from
you every year you got a sixf figureure
business also mckin Plano first want
your business to because moms have

[09:01]
your business to because moms have
friends and they're posting the Facebook
remember anyway good luck with this it
won't be easy but it'll be fun and
you'll make some cash the best part once
you do this you can apply these same
principles to any other business the
first few customers are the hardest
after that your referral marketing will
kick in anyway that's it that's the
tweet that I put out there let me see if
there's anything I would correct after
learning a lot more about this business
on site in person okay I called this
business low overhead built-in referral
marketing high margin scale low Capital
risk plenty of cheap labor side hustle
that can scale low overhead absolutely
still stand by that built in referral
marketing yes but it's unproven I don't
know the person that I talk to that owns
this business they don't try that
they've never tried it so it could work
it might not high margins yes scale fast
with low Capital risk I don't know about
scale fast I don't know about that it
might be tough to scale this is a
business with low barriers to entry
right low barriers to entry equals
you're probably going to have a lot of
competitors now and in the future it

[10:00]
competitors now and in the future it
comes with trade-offs plenty of cheap
labor yeah there's a lot of high
schoolers out there but it's not easy
managing high schoolers that can be a
challenge but the business that I just
spent time with castles of Dallas was
their name they only have a few
employees and it's like their niece's
nephews family members they mostly do
this themselves and it's a six figure
business side hustle that can scale yes
I definitely still stand by that here's
what I would change about this tweet
three different bounce houses one boy
themed one girl themed one neutral no I
wouldn't do that I would make them all
neutral based on a conversation that I
had with this business owner I asked her
what's the 8020 of the bounce house
business like if I'm going to buy one
bounce house or two what are you going
to push me towards cuz they' been in the
business for 10 years and they said very
specifically like a bounce house castle
with a slide that is detachable because
then they can remove the slide and play
with that they can keep the slide on it
and then if they were to get a second
one it would be a water slide that's
like the first two you want to get and
these guys know what they're talking
about cuz they do rentals that's their

[11:01]
about cuz they do rentals that's their
primary business but they also
manufacture them on site and so they
know what their local customers are
buying and what they're buying more of
and what they're repairing because
that's their third line of business of
repairs so they know exactly what's
getting used the most in DFW and I'm
pretty sure what's getting used the most
here is going to use the most everywhere
now I talked about getting a U-Haul
renting a U-Haul or buying a th000
trailer to launch this absolutely still
stand by that joining Facebook groups
Facebook Marketplace Craigslist to
Market absolutely one thing I don't know
if I still stand by is
the make $100,000 every summer if you
don't want to scale and make this
full-time I think that's pretty
aggressive let's just talk about Topline
Revenue if your average rental is $400
and you do 10 of these every week that's
10 pickups 10 drop offs 10 cleanings
because you do have to clean them every
time if you want to be legitimate and
not get bad reviews I learned that say
every pickup and drop off is 45 minutes
or an hour and a half total so that's 10
and 1 half hours for a week of picking
up and dropping off let's say an hour to
clean that's 202 hours so $4,000 a week

[12:03]
clean that's 202 hours so $4,000 a week
for a part-time job give or take that
doesn't include marketing time 20 hours
a week $4,000 a week 12 weeks a summer
that's $48,000 in a summer if you do 10
rentals a week Topline maybe bottom line
is 20,000 so times that by five to get
100,000 bottom line in a summer you're
going to have to do 50 drop offs and
deliveries per week now let's say you
get a big box trailer 50 per week is
really going to be more like 40 on the
weekends and 10 during the week actually
I take that back because they said
during the summer it's not weekend heavy
but outside of the summer it is weekend
heavy which makes sense so 50 deliveries
per week spread across 5 days that's 10
per day you could probably do just the
deliveries and drop offs with one person
if you plan your route and if you have a
a tight radius that you work within if
you have 10 deliveries in a day you can
load up all 10 in a box truck and just
kind of drop them off in a route so you
will utilize economies of scale as you

[13:00]
will utilize economies of scale as you
grow but let's just say let's just say
it's one person working an 80 hour weeks
in the summer they're just really
hustling they're working late nights to
clean they're working all day to deliver
and pick up theoretically you could make
$100,000 in a summer net profit if you
did 50 deliveries a week but that means
you're probably going to need to get
like 200 to 400 leads a week calls a
week let's say it's 300 that's like 40 a
day 40 calls a day four calls every
hour that's a lot of leads it would be
tough to do a 100 Grand profit in the
summer possible sure but you're going to
need some employees probably and that'll
cut into your margins so anyway that was
a little bullish but what I did learn is
that a very high quality bounce house
from China is about
$1,800 like you want it to be triple
threaded vinyl multiple layers of vinyl
you need to get it repaired every time
you get a leak repairs only cost $15 to

[14:00]
you get a leak repairs only cost $15 to
$40 for each time but you got to think
every time you're getting this repaired
you got to Lug around this 100b piece of
vinyl not easy these things are huge and
you got to clean them when it's not
raining or else they'll get muddy
sometimes you need a pressure washer to
clean them if they're real bad you can't
wrap them up when they're wet so you
need a place to set them up preferably a
place indoors and a place Outdoors if
you want to be able to clean them when
it's raining and then you got to let
them dry and then you got to fold them
up and then you got to store them
probably with a tarp on it so it doesn't
get wet when it rains when it's
outdoors you'll see in the in the video
in the out andabout Style video that
will come out next month what their
setup looks like but they only pay
$1,500 a month in rent for this metal
building that's on this massive Highway
that probably gets $40,000 cars a day
like it's the most amazing setup let's
talk about what I learned about the
industry the industry is growing at 6.2%
every year which is a lot the Bounce
House Market size is about $4 billion
and North America has has about
42% of the global Bounce House Market in

[15:02]
42% of the global Bounce House Market in
a postco world there's a lot more demand
for outdoor in-person
experiences oh and this is the best
thing I love about this business is that
you can easily easily Loop in all kinds
of other rentals the place I visited has
those $80 lifetime 6ot tables that like
fold out they're 80 bucks and they rent
them out for like $5 a day they have
those plastic cheap folding chairs that
cost them $15 they rent those out for $2
a day and it's a no-brainer they said 70
to 80% of their bounce house rentals
also rent plastic tables and folding
chairs cuz it's a kid's party they need
something to put snacks on they need a
place for the kids to sit and so all of
those ancillary rental items get paid
off in the first couple months and then
it's basically pure profit from then on
out this industry is extremely
fragmented there's not like a massive
Nationwide franchise Bounce House
Company that's just dominating which I
love the hard Parts about it it's
weather sensitive you might have to
implement a rain check policy depending
on where you live but I just love the

[16:01]
on where you live but I just love the
referral marketing aspect of this I just
I wish I could talk to someone that's
doing this because when a mom comes to
pick up her kid from a bounce house
party all the moms there that are coming
to pick up their kid are your next
potential customers it's a beautiful
thing all these kids are jumping in your
product that their parents could be
renting out the following weekend and so
I wouldn't even ask permission to put a
massive Banner with my domain name and
QR code at the top top of every bounce
house that gets rented out that's just
going to be the standard for me so then
when Mom comes to pick him up and she
sees how much fun Little Johnny's having
she's going to pull out her phone scan
the QR code and submit a lead to you you
can rent out tents like the big white
tents they use at weddings portable
flooring stages canopies backdrops and
then you can get into the wedding event
rental space you could do photo walls
photo booths the list goes on and on and
on popcorn machines cotton candy
machines snow cone machines margarita
machines chocolate fountains Portable
Restrooms generators heaters fans coat

[17:01]
Restrooms generators heaters fans coat
racks I love the rental business because
the stuff gets paid off and then you can
appreciate it and then you can sell it
so how can you find out what demand
there is for bounce houses well it's
December 15th right now it's not Bounce
House season depending on where you live
but you can still do research you can
still post a Facebook Marketplace it
doesn't cost you anything to do that you
will at least learn something I'd start
asking around posting on these
marketplaces seeing if you get anything
just post pictures that you get from the
internet before you even buy a bounce
house here's what I love about this
castles of Dallas business does they saw
that they were getting tons of
competitors all the time and they
thought huh how can we turn this lemon
into lemonade well they started
repairing bounce houses because if
they're getting more competitors then
they want to be in the repair business
not only the rental business or if
they're getting more competitors they
want to be in the manufacturing business
because these things cost hundreds of
dollars to ship from China unless you're
going to buy a whole shipping container
full which literally no one's going to
buy a shipping container full of bounce
houses so you can spend $1,800 on one

[18:01]
houses so you can spend $1,800 on one
from China which may or may not include
shipping so call it 2,000 just to be
safe or you can buy one that's
manufactured in Dallas for $1,500 that's
just as good of quality it's made out of
the same stuff and you don't have to pay
for shipping and then you're like the
expert you're like the local market
expert in the industry you can start
sending your competitors a newsletter
about what's happening what are people
renting out and then when your
competitor gets a A booking and all
their stuff's booked out they're going
to call you and say hey I've got this
rental in Plano but I'm all out would do
you want it you give me 25% of it and
you'll start getting referral calls
that's what's happening to these guys
insurance we got to talk insurance so
castles of Dallas spends 7 to $10,000 a
year on insurance it's a nothing Burger
it really is nothing and they've never
had an accident knock on wood they've
been in business for 10 years they
charge $100 an hour to leave an
attendant there and they're paying that
attendant like $15 an hour so that's a

[19:00]
attendant like $15 an hour so that's a
really good business as well imagine
starting a programmatic SEO website for
bounce house rental leads right find all
these far-flung rural areas because that
is one thing they told me is that
southeast Dallas was the best Market to
launch a bounce house rental business
because it's still quite rural whereas
North Dallas Plano Frisco mckin there's
a ton of infill and therefore there's a
ton of bounce house rental companies but
the rural areas are really profitable
for these guys you could start a
programmatic website selling bounce
house rent rental leads to bounce house
companies oh also she said that uh
paperclick on Google does really really
well for them it converts very nicely
you could sell party supplies rent party
supplies face painting you could
piggyback on like petting zoo businesses
or other types of rental businesses that
don't currently offer bounce house
rentals set up a massive bounce house in
your front yard with a big banner and
leave it there that's what they do at
their business if I were to launch a
bounce house rental business from my
house oh my gosh my house gets 22,000
cars driving by a day if I were to get a
massive massive Bounce House spend
$3,000 on it put it up in my front yard

[20:02]
$3,000 on it put it up in my front yard
247 with a huge Banner oh man just that
alone would be would make this a sixf
figure business I'm not exaggerating
22,000 cars every day this is a $500
ticket item If a half a percent of those
cars driving by a day call me for a lead
that's 100 leads a day a half a percent
if I close 20% of that that's 20 leads a
day now you listening to this you
probably don't live on a street that
gets 22,000 cars a day and for that I'm
grateful for your sake because it's not
the best but it is good for business
imagine buying like a super weird quirky
bounce house that naturally draws the
eyeballs we haven't even talked about
Instagram using social media for this
stuff oh how did I forget to talk about
obstacle courses obstacle courses
obstacle courses so funny story about
how I found this company to go spend
three hours with a couple days ago so I
had lined up an appointment to go make a
Christmas light installation video
onsite in person with my camera crew and
he flaked out on me last minute the

[21:00]
he flaked out on me last minute the
morning of this was Friday morning
December 13th Taylor Swift's birthday of
all of all days I scraped a list of
every bounce house rental company that
was close to my videographer he lives
south of Dallas awesome guy Micah there
were 77 of them I texted all 77 and said
hey you don't know who I am I don't know
who you are I know this is random I saw
your number on Google I really need to
film a video on the bounce house rental
business I have this podcast and I sent
if you're on my newsletter TKO pod.com
you can subscribe I sent a survey to all
my newsletter subscribers with 24
business ideas and I said tell me the
one that you want to learn about the
most and bounce house rentals was number
one which is true that's why I'm doing a
deep dive on this business so you guys
are telling me what to do content on
anyway I said can I spend three hours
with you this afternoon it was raining
it's the offseason for bounce houses and
like five people said yes but four of
those five were like yes but not
tomorrow maybe Saturday I'm like it has
to be tomorrow like it's Christmas time
things are crazy busy I can't do this on
Saturday and one of them was gracious

[22:00]
Saturday and one of them was gracious
enough castles of Dallas to say yeah
come on over let's do it and it just so
happened that that was probably the only
business I texted that also repairs and
manufactures these things so it's a very
Dynamic video it's not only rentals and
it's not only bounce off rentals because
they do Event Rentals and heaters air
conditioning units all kinds of stuff so
you're going to like the video anyway it
is winter time which means you have 3
four months before the weather warms up
that gives you 3 four months to plan
this out and to launch this business and
you don't have any excuses okay so how
do we do this first we find our first
customer and then we launch the business
