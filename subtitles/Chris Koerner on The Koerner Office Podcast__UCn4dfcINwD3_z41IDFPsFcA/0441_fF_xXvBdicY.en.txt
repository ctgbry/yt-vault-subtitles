[00:00]
this is a billion dooll business Cruise
Line International Association says that
70% of cruises are booked through travel
agents that's just a middleman who's
taking a margin this ugly website 8
million customers served do the math on
that you know $1,000 Cruise times 8
million are you kidding me yeah it's
stupid these are people that we eat
dinner with every night they paid six
times as much for the same experience I
think that that would be a really good
nich to try to disrupt the cruise agent
booking Market
all right well Connor welcome back
you've been on like six or eight times
now it's always fun happy to be here and
uh yeah you brought some ideas today
always man yeah this is this is my best
my most my most YouTube DM whatever that
metric looks like show that I will go on
from a podcast circuit standpoint so I
want to come with good ideas and I want
people to either rip them apart or tell
me that they started it and they want my
blessing afterwards so we can go down
any way you want I'm I'm excited

[01:00]
any way you want I'm I'm excited
all right well let's do this golf club
one yeah cool all right do you golf uh
no okay Nei neither do I but I'm trying
to get into it okay cool right now I've
just said no too many times to people
that Golf and so I'm trying to get into
it so if you look up golf club dude golf
club dude so I don't know if this is big
or not but this is the one where I think
this guy takes used golf clubs okay and
he refurbishes them and you you know his
whole thing is villainizing right like
if hey if you're a beginner don't spend
money on the new sets whatever like come
to my website I'm going to buy all of
this stuff I'm I'm like an expert golfer
and I'll show you what you actually need
and sell them to you for way cheaper so
you said golf club dude but it's golf
set dude is that right yeah it's it's
totally golf set dude okay cool I just
want to make sure so really interesting
guy and really interesting business and
it got me thinking I think Facebook
Marketplace is the new Craigslist by a

[02:00]
Marketplace is the new Craigslist by a
long shot and this is not new or or
crazy information but if you start
looking up all of the different things
that Facebook Marketplace will sell I
think that you'll quickly realize that
like there's a lot of opportunity to buy
used stuff and refurbish it polish it up
make it better and try to sell it as a
more branded way online okay like golf
sets golf sets as an example so this is
the first concept is like what can you
find that's also on Facebook Marketplace
that you can either be like the de facto
guy for and like build a brand around
that like if you're on X you constantly
will see like there's so many like
something guys so like you know there's
a mattress guy now there's a mattress
guy there's there's a luxury watch guy
right and there's like all of these
channels where you specialize in one
Niche and something that has a ton of
volume for it already and now you can
become the expert on it and I think that
people are willing to pay a premium on
that where it's hey I'm okay buying
secondhand products so long as I'm not
getting screwed and this is where like
the information and expertise comes in

[03:01]
the information and expertise comes in
you know the reason there's the mattress
guy the reason that there's the luxury
watch collection guy or the cigar guy
right it's because ah I'm willing to
spend the nice money but like I'm an
amateur golfer I don't know too much
about whiskey or roxus or whatever like
come educate me and so finding finding
niches that can cater to that I think is
very smart I like it because social
media is perfect for building trust at
scale right so I was actually just
emailing with the mattress guy like last
week and I was like what's your website
I don't have one well what does like
your funnel look like I hop on calls
with people and I sell them $7,000
mattresses for $2,000 and I I make a
margin there oh okay and it's like well
people trust you because if he were to
screw over one person they'd blast about
it on Twitter and he's out of business
it's a beautiful way of doing business
right I so I think it's great for that
reason and I think it also needs to be
high ticket I think golf sets are about
as low ticket as you can get and there
500 bucks or whatever yep but I I

[04:03]
500 bucks or whatever yep but I I
completely agree right like it's it's
not worth getting into this business if
you're going to be the book guy and you
you sell somebody on a $12 book that
you're like they're great but I do think
that if you wanted to do it from a
really any form of sport I guess as long
as you can get like close to a $500 aov
average order value as the minimum I
think that that's smart other ones that
I can see working out really well would
be like all things gym renovation wise
or and you know making sure that that's
a kit I think just building a business
around what is something that you enjoy
that is a large enough Cam that also is
expensive and so there's another one
this guy has over 10,000 followers on on
X and his name is Kevin Shen and he does
home video Studio build outs so he'll
sell two versions of this he'll either
sell the DIY course and the DIY course
is is you know all here's the best

[05:01]
is is you know all here's the best
webcams based on the price range like
here's how to configure them here's how
to set it up you know if you put one
little light in your background like it
makes the effects 10 times better
whatever right and like you can buy the
course on that or they'll actually fly
out to your home office your home studio
whatever and they'll do the entire build
out for you so that way you don't have
to lift the finger and the co part about
that is like that's a I have no idea how
much it cost but I bet it's like a
$20,000 package and like the other one
is an info product business that
probably is littered with affiliate
links that can probably scale up very
well very efficiently as well like if
I'm on this website right now dream
studioc course.com is what it's called
and if I scroll down to the pricing okay
so just the essentials for a video
curriculum $500 if you want to join a
cohort based course it's 1,200 and then
the done for you consulting which is
everything from profession background

[06:00]
everything from profession background
design expert gear guidance I think they
fly out is $8,000 so like jeez yeah but
but here's the hack on this right is
like he's done it for all the big guys
like he's done it the S pars the Nick
sharmas the Thiago fores and so like if
you're doing it to that degree and
you're just good and you're Tech focused
like there's not a whole lot of extra
variables but now everyone sees these
guys like they are a public billboard
For You especially as their audiences
grow and I think that that can
increasingly be a big business
especially if you do it for free for
them it's like hey man just mentioned me
one time I'm cool oh man why isn't there
like a travel agent guy do you know that
travel agents are still a thing like
in-person old school my my wife used as
a travel agent and like you you don't
really pay for them because they're paid
by by the the travel companies so two
things on that I think one one of my
friends who like I don't know you kind
of think it would I think of travel
agents that think of like my my

[07:00]
agents that think of like my my
grandparents would use a travel agent
like it just feels outdated right now
that you have all these middlemen the
expedience whatever but I do have a good
friend of mine who's very Tech forward
and everything and his whole thing is
like they went on their honeymoon and
they went to South Africa and like some
spots it just is way more beneficial to
have the travel agent because you can't
get the reservations you need what I
have found and I'm trying to find it on
my Twitter to make sure that like I
actually have the right thing it's some
crazy number of cruises are booked
through travel agents like I think like
I'm G to make up this number and and
somebody fact check me on this but like
I think it's like 80% of all people all
cruise tickets sold are booked through
travel agents I believe it I mean we
we've been on like 12 cruises and we've
booked most of them through an agent
really yeah the the agent would like you
to believe that they save you money and
I think sometimes they do or they can I

[08:00]
I think sometimes they do or they can I
don't know it's just kind of how the
industry operates I don't even know why
we do but like when we start talking
about a Royal Caribbean cruise again we
have like a lady that we call we're like
hey hook hook us up and it's funny
because she's always like well you you
know if you sign up today you'll get
$500 of onboard credits and it's like I
go to royalcaribbean.com it says the
same thing like what so okay so here's
here's the thing cruise lines a cruise
line International Association says that
70% of cruises book through travel
agents okay that's just that's just a
middleman who's taking a margin like can
you build an Expedia only for cruises a
job board only for cruises where it is
the de facto everything that you need to
know about and then like going back to
the Creator Le Brands if you're really
into cruises or like you want to be a
travel influencer and you want a niche
like one of the not so cool like you're
probably not going to get flown out by
Emirates and the $20,000 Suite right you
probably could get a suite on a Royal
Caribbean Cruise Line and so I think

[09:01]
Caribbean Cruise Line and so I think
that that would be a really good Niche
to try to disrupt the cruise agent
booking Market well so dude go to
vacations too.com have you been there
never this is what you're talking about
this is a billion doll business I did a
deep dive on Twitter a while ago it's
it's literally a billion dollar business
this ugly website yeah eight million
customers served in the last 40 years do
the math on that you know $1,000 Cruise
times8 million are you kidding me yeah
it's stupid it's it's worthy of a deep
dive why is this not just like the
number one thing that people are are
building right now I think for like
anyone aged 50 and over which is like
80% of the cruise Market this is the
thing this is their Expedia see man
here's here's the thing that some of
these like business idea podcasts right
there there's business ideas where I'm
like Ah that's such a good idea that I
got to keep it in like the bottom parts
of the notes app so that way like it
doesn't come up and we're not too public

[10:01]
doesn't come up and we're not too public
about it this would be one of those
ideas that I feel like somebody should
genuinely start like cruises are such a
big market and if this is the website
that is leading it for eight million
Travelers that's insane dude here's
where I think the opportunity is I've
had this idea since the first time I
went on a cruise which was like 2009
okay 15 years we're talking so I'm a
cheap skate total cheap skate if you go
on a cruise it's it's all a racket right
they're going to break even on you
hopefully luckily on the ticket and then
they're going to make money when you
gamble and when you drink but guess what
I don't do any of those things so and I
eat more than the average human being so
ain't no Cruise Line making money on me
but there is a third way where they make
a lot of money and that's on shore
excursions okay you want to go
snorkeling you get to coost Rica you
want to go ziplining it's going to be
179 bucks a person yeah and when have
you been on a cruise

[11:00]
you been on a cruise
no no a so you get off the boat and then
there's going to be someone waiting for
you a local in a nice shirt they're
going to be holding a sign and you're
going to go with them and it's coner
you're going to get in like a rickety
School Bus they're going to take you in
the middle of the Jungle and you get
there and then there's like a shack and
you you swipe your car well you've
already paid I guess and it's tons of
money and you're there for two or three
hours and you have fun and then they
drive you back to the boat they make
sure that you're there in time and when
you're on the boat it's this big scare
tactic it's genius because
there's there's like sales pitches and
announcements 247 on these boats so
they're always like all right be sure to
stop by if you haven't booked your shore
shore excursions yet and of course
they're going to do everything they can
to get you to book that before you ever
step foot on the boat if you haven't
please go to our coner Travel Service
and you can choose from many options
once again we will remind you be sure to
book only through Royal Caribbean
because you won't be able to guarantee
that you'll get back to your boat in
time or that you'll be safe or that you
won't get murdered and left in the
jungle like like it's all Scare Tactics

[12:01]
jungle like like it's all Scare Tactics
but it's all a racket because it's the
same companies it's the same businesses
I was gonna say like we I travel I
travel a good amount and I haven't
really done much stuff through an ageny
and like you know I'll go to some spots
my mom's like be careful and it's like
hey it's it's fine like people get way
more scared based on the news but if you
look at the average American I think
there's some crazy stats of like 33%
have never left their state and like 70%
have never left the country so it's like
if to a lot of people Mexico is a very
scary place whereas like for others it's
like all it's it's Mexico so yeah I I
can agree with that 100% And I think at
an older age too like as I know now my
parents also just got back from a cruise
whatever like and they're going with a
bunch of their friends and like they
just want to be hampered they don't want
to have to think they don't want they
don't want to think about it right
exactly they want they and they want to
get excited about somebody else's idea
of hey we're coming up to Germany like
this is the oldest castle like you have

[13:00]
this is the oldest castle like you have
to check it out and it's like right six
years of their lives have gone by
they've never thought about this Castle
but this is now the number one thing
they want say because somebody said it's
the best thing to do and so there's
definitely an exciting element to that
well dude it's like there's a whole hack
to it so this is what I do I don't book
anything when I get on the boat we have
no shore excursions planned when you get
off the boat I I I would bet 80 to 90%
of people book shore excursions through
the cruise line you walk off the boat
and you're going to see all kinds of
like Huts people standing there wearing
branded shirts and they're going to be
selling you like hey are you going with
this oh we haven't booked anything yet
oh come do snorkeling and b y y and like
how much oh 120 NOP you start walking
away oh 100 I did this in Biz is like a
22y old this guy's like it's $120 I'm
like 30 he's like no all 30 come on bro
come on 30 I'm like it's 30 it's $30 I'm
no no no no no I'm like okay I'll go try
the next guy do the old walk away okay
30 bucks because like like the gas is

[14:00]
30 bucks because like like the gas is
paid for the bus is there they're right
there it's free money to them they're
just going to give you a snorkel that
they've given to a thousand other people
and we so then we get on the bus and
we're the only people on this bus that
don't have like a fancy wristband that
was booked through the cruise right but
it's the same thing that everyone on the
cruise paid for it's like these are
people that we eat dinner with every
night they paid six times as much for
the same experience and we're talking
like what' you pay for this 180 what'
you pay 30 what how did you it's like I
didn't buy through so like I think there
needs to be a a vacations to go or an
Expedia for shore excursions we're like
vetted local trusted providers and then
that's your whole value prop is like
these are the same providers that
Carnival and Royal Caribbean use but you
just have to you get to skip the
middleman yeah that's great no I love
that I think I think the hard part is
getting to that connection but I think
if you go on Shore and go on ground I
think that absolutely work I just got
back from this is not really related to
business at this point but like I got

[15:00]
business at this point but like I got
back from Jamaica last month and I was
we were out in the water and I quickly
realized that the mafia just runs
everything there because really yeah we
were just kind of drinking in the water
and hanging out and some guy just pulls
up like basically to the beach with like
a tube in the back and it was like all
right if you are watching this clip
right now you are watching this on
YouTube and if you are a fan of podcast
please check out my podcast while you're
at it because sometimes I have podcasts
that aren't on YouTube and sometimes I
have YouTubes that aren't on podcast so
check out the Kerner office on any
podcast platform or you can go to TKO
pod.com also my newsletter will throw
that in there there are no ads It's
weekly it's different content than my
podcast and YouTube newsletter. chrisj
cerner.com You'll see the link and we'll
see you there and he was like hey come
on on like $30 like come come for a ride
on the tube and like grab my girlfriend
I was like come on let's go and she was
a little iffy on it and then you see the
guys on the shore like five big dudes
look at that guy and go no and they're
like if this guy pointing to me wants to
go for a ride here they have to come
through us and they pay us and then

[16:01]
through us and they pay us and then
we'll give you something because this is
our beach and like you can't just come
around and take a cut of it so that was
we didn't we didn't end up going on the
tube afterwards geez dude but I will I
will say I do think that that would
absolutely work dude real quick that
story reminds me of a crazy story that I
just heard on Sunday not related to
anything we're talking about but it's
good content and it's a good story so I
think you and everyone listening will
like it so I'm in church I'm teaching
Sunday school with this my buddy Tom and
I don't remember what we're talking
about but he starts talking about his
Sunday school teacher when he was a kid
his name was Gordon Hall and I'm saying
his name publicly because this is all
public record but he had he orchestrated
one of the biggest Ponzi schemes of all
time in Arizona in like the 90 ' 80s and
90s and he was all tied up with the
mafia doing stock manipulation right and
that's crazy he was like he had a
52,000 squ foot house
52,000 to
he had a billboard on the top that said

[17:01]
he had a billboard on the top that said
Gordon Hall's
Mansion okay that's what kind of guy
this this guy was but here's the crazy
thing he got sentenced to prison he's in
prison today he's still alive he'll be
in there for like 14 more years and he
was all tied up with the mafia to man
manipulate these stock prices and to get
a a better deal this is as I understand
it I might be misremembering something
he like sold out the mafia and you will
not find this on the news anywhere but
this is a true story from my friend Tom
who went to church with his whole family
a year to the day that he was sentenced
to prison his daughter Gordon's daughter
died
suspiciously like they they called it
anorexia but she wasn't even like that
skinny she just like died and they're
like oh I guess it was anorexia and then
a year later to the day on this two-year
anniversary his son died in a HIIT and
run where they never found the
driver this true story like this will be
a Netflix documentary one day
that's crazy is terrible I can't even

[18:02]
that's crazy is terrible I can't even
fathom like how people get into these
schemes that are that elaborate that
then have people like I don't know I
guess with all the United like living in
Manhattan right now like all the United
Healthcare stuff I don't I know it's a
big thing throughout the whole country
but also just right now too like yeah
people putting out hits people like
covering up murders people going to jail
for 20 years like it's crazy we live in
weird worlds we do anyway that was a
little tangent we both have ADD so it
makes sense but well to bring it back to
the full beginning of the golf set dude
the thing that I was GNA say is of the
other verticals of things that can be
done one that I think would be really
good that nobody talks about today I've
it's new to me so I don't know if it's
new to everyone aquascapes so aquascapes
are basically like the love of trying to
build up an aquarium and so you're
trying to build up a tank you want to
have you know these types of Pebbles on
the ground you want this water filter
you want this base for your thing

[19:00]
you want this base for your thing
whatever like it's the same people who
geek out about their home office setup
or their their desk set up or whatever
else like want a cool Aquascape and so
this is a really big Community like
there's 162,000 people in this subreddit
and I guarantee you if somebody goes on
Instagram and picks up the tagline the
Aquascape guy and start just reviewing
all of these different products and like
if there's all this stuff like you have
to be passionate enough about it you
have to like know what you're talking
about like eventually you'll probably
get into the game of like all right I
now know all of these rare fish species
but if you if that's something that
interests you this business would work
like it absolutely would work like tanks
go for like anywhere from a 100 to like
a several thousand dollars and you can
do so many different ranges that like
even just building out content on this
like the money from the affiliate
Revenue alone would be enough for a very
valuable business dude it's making me
think of this video I saw that had like
a 100 million views I'm going to text A

[20:01]
a 100 million views I'm going to text A
variation of it to you MH it is a an
aquarium with like a hollow I just
texted it to you a hollow cavity built
out in the middle for a cat to sit in
and look
around yeah and so oh gez you could
totally be the Aquascape guy I think the
the magic is high ticket preferably like
small enough to ship like watches
perfect right and like car de dealership
guy perfect because people ship cars
across the country all the time right
even though they're huge it the price
point it works don't do like the couches
unless like maybe right I don't know
like the Facebook Marketplace is it's
Furniture go lower and so like it just
seems hard like people people want
somebody to come by and pick up their
stuff so if you're willing to do that
and you can refurbish it well maybe
there's a game there but yeah that's I
think that's a good one the one that
I'll just throw out the opportunity here
and I don't have a clear solution but I
know it's a big problem is Pian or a
nightmare to get rid of I don't know if

[21:01]
nightmare to get rid of I don't know if
you've run dude I've tweeted about this
did I'm doing a whole video about this
yeah dude oh like you tweeted about this
recently like two months ago so I mean
we own storage facilities like it's
every time you take over a facility you
have to go through and like look through
all the units and figure out what the
junk is whatever and like we opened up
one actually in Fort Worth and we open
up like four units and each unit had
like 10 pm and I was like oh no like
what a nightmare so because like they're
hard to dispose of like you take with
the dump the dump freaking charges you
like by the pound basically Pi are heavy
as hell so like truly the best thing
that we could do is a try to like just
try to auction them off like not even
auction like free free Pian we would
call local churches see if anyone wants
them donated but like not all of them
are even in great shape so I don't know
if there's a business model here I just
really big problem know one okay what

[22:00]
really big problem know one okay what
you got yes so dude I was on threads I
was on threads and I posted something
about something I don't remember and
this guy commented and he's like I
assumed he worked for a moving company
but he didn't say he's like my boss used
to do this when we got slow we didn't
have any jobs he would hop on Facebook
Marketplace and copy and paste the same
message saying we'll come pick up your
piano for 250 bucks as then you pay us
250 to come get it and they've got big
box tricks just sitting there they're
not doing anything and he's like we
would pick up five six seven in a day
once every now and then so then I went
to Facebook Marketplace out of curiosity
I I went to the Center of Dallas and I
set a 50 mile radius so I got all of DFW
guess how many free posos are listed
every day in how is how many it's like
55 to 65 a day yeah free people can't
get rid of them like so no it's like a
liability and so it's just it's a
numbers game you you could literally say
I'm going to be by Fort Worth on

[23:01]
I'm going to be by Fort Worth on
Thursday with my box truck this is my
business we're called You Know piano
movers.com it's going to be 250 bucks
we'll take it out of your house like we
just show up you don't have to do
anything we'll open the door even and
you just on Monday you DM 60 people
Tuesday 60 people Wednesday 60 people
maybe you have 10 appointments set up by
Thursday you rent a U-Haul for $59.99 a
day plus 75 cents a mile you don't even
buy a box star you just go pick all
those suckers up drop off at the dump
yep I I completely agree on all that I
think the only the only step further
that I would take it is is there any way
that you can make money because because
the dump is gonna charge you like to to
dump all of these pias it's still
profitable it is I believe it 100% I
believe it especially when time flow
right like you know you can still make
some money there I think the next
iteration is like is there something you
can do to the piano to make money to get
paid to pick it up and to get paid to

[24:01]
paid to pick it up and to get paid to
dispose of it I know that I'm gonna get
the entire process wrong here so I
apologize to anyone listening but like
there is somebody that I met a long time
ago and he picks up tires he gets paid
to take the tires his tires also are
kind of a pain in the ass and he has
some Machinery that I converts it into
Power into what into powder into Power
like electricity because that's a thing
I think I think he just cuts them up
up and like they're used for like CH
pets or something yeah there's like it's
like artificial mulch and they'll paint
it brown and it's it's very expensive
because it's permanent mulch you don't
have to replace it every spring so maybe
that's what it is I'm blanking on it
slightly but like the business model of
getting paid to take the thing and get
rid of it is a very good business model
it's like negative cogs yeah yeah
negative cogs cash up front all is good
dude when I posted about this it was
very polarizing cuz everyone was like

[25:00]
very polarizing cuz everyone was like
you can't throw pianos away what are you
doing that's art and it's like we need
to stop buying crap we're buying crap we
got to do something with it i' I'd love
to sell it trust me I would love to sell
it but what are we gonna do I just
respond all those people and tell them
that you have 50 pianos for them at
their doorstep if they want to pick them
up like Hey listen I'm not throwing them
away anymore they're all yours they're
they're free take them people were like
well what if you like assemble them in a
warehouse and you donate them to like
assisted living facilities and it's like
if they wanted or needed them they would

same same goes with skis same goes with
whatever else and so like anything where
there's like a little bit of a beginner

getting more content and now they trust
you in the beginning of that journey and
they're willing to have a high LTB get
