look at this freaking thing right here I
can think of so many business
applications for this thing day 67 of
Genius business ideas follow for more
number one the downsell opportunity sell
this equipment to oil change shops you
know how you get your oil change and
afterwards like hey do you want to buy
this air filter for 40 bucks and if
you're cheap like me you're going to say
no well someone were to downsell me
after I say no and say hey how about we
just do this we have the specialized
equipment and what they're saying when
they use the word specialize is that
it's expensive which is bracing me for a
price that actually won't be that high
and we can just blast all that dirt out
of your filter for 15 bucks would I say
yes to that yes and it's probably just
as profitable if not more profitable
than selling me a new air filter because
it's a service and not a product they
have to buy from someone else or I can
see myself buying one of these and going
to a truck stop especially out west in a
Dusty area because those truck air
filters can cost up to 90 bucks say hey
I'll clean out your air filter right now
for 35 Bucks new technology equals new
business opportunities
