[00:00]
I was like I'm going to make these
sneakers out of playoff towels that I
went to Growing Up So I just made them I
ended up spending the whole day with
Mike Conley an UNP purchasable
experience what is a permissionless
project doing work without permission
I've literally changed my life and my
career by doing permissionless project
nameless account 18 followers I tweet
this and we're on a FaceTime within 10
minutes we work with big Fortune 500
companies on like defining what's next
for them we're adding like billions to
the bottom line like I think the biggest
opportunity for people listening is
[Music]
like Jord why don't you tell us who you
are what you do I'm Jordan mix I'm a
partner at late checkout many people
might know late checkout from Greg
Eisenberg he's a prolific internet
Creator but also entrepreneur and
business person and we've got a holding
company and we work on some of your
favorite products you know you're
probably using one of our products right
now that we've worked on and we've got a
series of companies LCA is our main

[01:00]
series of companies LCA is our main
Innovation agency that designs
futuristic interfaces for the AI age so
we worked with like big Fortune 500
companies on like defining what's next
18 to 24 months down the road for them
and then we've got the startup ideas
podcast which a lot of people might have
seen you might have seen Chris on an
episode you know that that triggered
some beef a little bit oh yeah yeah it
did a little a little beef and then
we've got startup Empire our internet
Community where we basically teach
people and help people run our very
similar Playbook using the audience
Community product framework which is
like find an internet audience put them
in a community learn what they want and
then build products that they're begging
for so we've done that many times and we
we did that to start an acquired boring
marketer which is our last holding isn't
late checkout know you guys sign like
million dollar agreements with these
Fortune 500 companies yeah we try to do
like average uh like lifetime value of a
project is yeah seven figures so we we
sometimes start on a a lower six figure

[02:01]
sometimes start on a a lower six figure
Sprint and then expand out but yeah
we're we're truly adding like billions
to the bottom line um though uh so it
sounds like a lot these are like big
agencies but you know we've got case
studies that are that are out there that
we can we can share I don't want to put
them on blast but you can sift through
them if you go to the website but yeah
we added like literally like two billion
in market share for a publicly traded
company for work that we did so and
you're just helping them launch products
yeah it's everything thing so it's like
conceptualizing things that they can't
see like using their Community to make
products way more sticky like thinking
about interfaces in a way that they
haven't been thought about before
borrowing from like consumer social and
you know B2B SAS product that gets like
consumer socialized is just a delight
for users and it's just like it it feels
so fresh when they launch it so like
that's our whole pitch is like forget
about your your 12- month road map we're
building for the 18 to 24

[03:00]
building for the 18 to 24
I would bet most people have never even
heard of an agency like this is this
even approachable to people starting an
agency like this how do you find a
decision maker at a company like
Microsoft slack whatever that's the hard
part and it's like a it's a network game
and that's why we only work with like 8
to 12 people a year we cap it at that
for a very specific reason cuz we can do
the best work in that those constraints
and so yeah it's a it's a it's a network
game for sure and really like it's it's
kind of doing permissionless projects
you know which we're we're going to talk
about today is like just doing stuff and
thinking about their business in ways
that they've never thought about it
before and reading between the lines is
just the best way to stand out in
today's like age it's just like there's
a bunch of noise but if you take just a
little thought a little care you can
intercept some people at the highest
level like I we actually I just learned
that from David SRA the the founders
podcast guy his network is crazy how did

[04:01]
podcast guy his network is crazy how did
he get to that point just because smart
people started listening to him and
respecting him like he was building
trust at scale and then he just made
connections with them yeah I mean like
the tldr is he read 175 biographies and
has done three-hour episodes monologued
about those and he has this weird
parasocial relationship with a very high
value audience that they think that he
is like a dead dead person like they
think that he is like Charlie Munger you
know so now billionaires will call him
and be like what would Charlie Munger do
with this problem right and by
parasocial you mean it's kind of more of
like a one-way relationship yeah exactly
yeah parasocial relationship like
they're he's in a Billionaire's ears for
three for three straight hours yeah like
he doesn't know the billionaires but
they know him very well which is even
more important his trust and Affinity is
like way higher with them

[05:00]
like way higher with them
and like I mean if you think about their
hourly rate like they don't even have an
hourly rate but like they're donating
three hours of their their time to
listen to him talk and you know it's
just traveled like word of mouth and he
is he is like an encyclopedia like it is
incredibly impactful like the way he can
distill framework and like put this
stuff out so think of all the overlap of
skills that he has to have to be where
he is cuz on the surface it's like oh
he's just reading books and talking
about him B deal it's like well no like
first of all he probably has a
photographic memory second of all he has
this infectious energy when he talks
that most people just don't naturally
have right third of all like he he
genuinely loves diving in and learning
these things it reminds me of was it Ben
Wilson how to take over the world
podcast guy he told a story about this
billionaire that wanted his advice and
wanted to pay him a stupid amount of
money to just like teach him about
history and it's the same thing just
just because he was listening to his

[06:00]
just because he was listening to his
podcast totally yeah it it is it is a
frame breaking experience to hear those
guys talk about it because it is very
real I wasn't like a huge fan of David
to be honest and I mean I respected his
craft But like after we spent that time
with him at the beginning of this year I
was just like oh my dude like I I was
sleeping on him like incredible
incredible like I was like I'm I know
it's like the shack meme it's like I
apologize I I wasn't familiar with your
game okay well let's start talking about
permissionless whatever permissionless
projects I feel like this is just the
perfect thing to talk about because I
did a keynote last year on finding your
white whale how to land a white whale
and I Define a white whale as being a
business partner or a customer or a
vendor or someone like that one
connection one relationship that could
be worth more than every other
relationship in that business in your
life and I feel that pairs very nicely

[07:00]
life and I feel that pairs very nicely
uh with what we're talking about here
yeah I mean like I've literally changed
my my life and my career by doing
permissionless projects and like I
didn't invent them I didn't invent it by
any any means how I got started I was
like I was doing mechanical engineering
in college and I ended up in Asheville
North Carolina working at this plant
Factory like as a design engineer where
we were making like literal utility
trucks okay and I was on I was there for
for seven months and like at the end I'd
made friends with this country guy named
Drew you know he was like dipping in the
cubicles and like crazy guy and he came
into like my little like intern office
and was like never leave College never
leave College like you're this is like
the best time of your life and that just
like hollowed me out and I was like I
can't have that happen like I can't just
like I'm not GNA do that like now my
engineering career is over like
corporate is over what else am going to
do when I graduate in four months that

[08:03]
do when I graduate in four months that
one off-hand comment that he probably
says to all kinds of people it just like
completely changed your brain yeah
because I just spent six months like
while my friends were all still in
college like going to football games and
doing the whole thing like I was working
so it already didn't feel good like I
was two hours away already sucked so
like when he threw that icing on the
cake you know at the end of the the
seven Monon like Co-op agreement or
whatever like I was just like no dude
this like I've got to find a better way
way to do it and I don't know what it is
like I didn't grow up like very
entrepreneurial at all but like that
moment was like okay you've got to
figure it out on make it on your own
like how the f are you gonna do that
were you at UT yeah I was at Knoxville
yeah Tennessee Okay University of
Tennessee and you're working a couple
hours away you're almost done with
school he says that comment and you're
like I don't even know what
entrepreneurship is but I need to look
into this because I I love Drew I don't
want to be Drew I don't want to ever say
that about my I don't want to ever come
into another guy's cubicle and tell him
that exactly yeah

[09:00]
that exactly yeah
I don't want to I don't want to be Drew
I love him but yeah exactly so like that
sent me down like the Tim Ferris Rabbit
Hole somehow like I went down the 4H
hour work week and then you know that
whole that whole thing with just like
how do you optimize your life how do you
make the life of your own and I stumbled
upon Ryan holiday Ryan holiday's like
canvas strategy and this was like the
this is like the early days of like
permissionless projects to me and I'm
actually going to share my screen
because I have like a little like
presentation that I just think it would
be like is amazing cool to walk through
I just like permissionless projects I
really think you can like change your
life doing this so what is a
permissionless project like doing work
without permission like it could be
whatever it could be literally like
asking your partner's father if if you
can marry her or like you know like
getting a job or starting a business so
like the evolution going back is like
the canvas strategy with Ryan holiday
this this idea is basically like instead
of waiting for or a path to to be open

[10:01]
of waiting for or a path to to be open
for you create your own path by being a
blank canvas that people higher up can
paint on so basically like do things
that make other people look good and you
in return will accidentally carve the
path that you could never have seen for
yourself in the first place I mean it's
back to First principles we're you're
playing on their ego and their pride and
their vanity in a good way right
everyone's got it dude you know like yep
everyone's got it so as soon as you
realize that you just like have to lean
into it and just start seeing the world
through this lens like how can I how can
I be a canvas and like that's what I
hope like people listening to this take
away today it's like doesn't matter if
you're starting out or like 30 years
into your career like having this
mindset truly has changed my life and
just like how I look out how an outlook
on the on the world what was Ryan
holiday's big story that got him to
think along this way do you know he's
like a life like a career
canvas stoicism guy yeah now he was

[11:03]
canvas stoicism guy yeah now he was
Robert Green the power law 48 power laws
his like apprentice and I think it was
like a cold cold like knock on the door
even like wasn't even like a DM he like
just like pulled up to his office and
then he was like the youngest uh Chief
marketing officer of American Apparel
and he took them from like 20 to
hundreds of millions of dollars as a
22-year-old and then he started writing
books became an author and now he has
like a really cool bookstore places so
but after the canvas strategy like I was
just like already doing this stuff in my
in my daily life but I stumbled upon
visualize value Jack Butcher and he has
just a really interesting way of framing
it and he called it The permissionless
Apprentice do the thing before you get
the thing do the job before you get the
job like just take action and good
things will come and now we're like in
this phase of the Internet it's like you
can just do things you know it's like
these all are the exact same thing and
the exact same principle and like you

[12:01]
the exact same principle and like you
can you can just do things I want to
show some like results of me like doing
this so you're saying the canvas
strategy permissionless apprenticeship
and you can just do things three
different ways of saying the same thing
just create your own future but not in
like a a woooo way like a Tony Robin
seminar but in like a very specifically
here's how you do it here is why you you
should do it and here is how
approachable it actually is yeah and
it's the same thing you said about like
going after your white whale or finding
your dream client or it's all the exact
same you know like we run startup Empire
and everyone's all everyone asks me like
how do you how do they go from like two
clients to 10 clients whether it's a
service or a SAS and it's like it's
doing this you know it's it's like
literally find eight people on LinkedIn
and like just do stuff that is on the
bottom third of their to-do list and
they will end up paying you and they
will become a client so like it
proliferates through like every every
little piece of business and really just
life in general okay so

[13:02]
life in general okay so
I'm what I've like some stories not to
brag but just like this these are the
W's that I that I've taken by doing this
over like literally 10 years and then
I'm going to say like then we're going
to break down like how anyone listening
can do this and like what you need to
look for how do you how do you read
between the lines and then we can just
jam on like a ways that I would do this
in
2025 okay yep cool so I grew up in
Memphis my favorite basketball player
growing up was Mike Conley and I knew
how to make sneakers he got traded away
to the to the Utah Jazz and he was going
to come back on you know his homecoming
game and I was like I'm going to make
these sneakers out of playoff towels
that I went to growing up and make these
sneakers out of the playoff runs that he
put us through and I'm going to meet him
and we're going to like going to we're
going to hang out and so I just made
them it took me like 40 hours to hand
make these Jordan 1es from scratch how

[14:00]
make these Jordan 1es from scratch how
did you learn to make shoes at all I
just was very interested in it and I
went to this school in New York called
the shoe surgeon he he's done work for
like Justin Bieber and like LeBron and
all these people so he had like a
four-day class in New York that I went
through because I was just like really
curious and wanted to put my hands on
what did that cost it was like three
grand okay yeah it was like the most
ever spent on like professional
development or like personal development
at the time like I was like what am I
doing and I was like getting married in
like 3 weeks like it's funny because
three three grand is like half a
semester at UT and we don't even bat an
ey but when you pay three grand for
something like this that it could end up
changing your life it's like oh man what
am I doing you know totally yeah I'm
like how am I going to tell my mom that
I paid three grand to go to New York and
make sneakers that sounds ridiculous
anyway like the head of like the media
division of the Grizzlies ended up using
me as a pawn to get him on to get Mike
Conley in his media day so he
reached out to me Chris Vernon this guy

[15:01]
reached out to me Chris Vernon this guy
like the color commentator of the
Grizzlies and he was trying to get time
with Mike Conley while he was in town
and Chris Vernon saw these on Twitter
like just going viral because I was like
yo help me get these to Mike connley
like we're going to make it happen like
help me out Memphis and so Chris Vernon
used me as like hey I've got this guy
who's trying to give you shoes if you
want to piggy he piggybacked we like
collabed yeah on it and like I ended up
like spending the whole day with Mike
Conley like an UNP purchasable
experience it was just coincidental that
the commentator also wanted to get a
hold of this guy at the same time you
happen to be going viral so he
piggybacked on you yeah like he reached
out and said yo I'm trying to get him on
the show like let's make it happen I'll
help you out but I learned later that he
was like trying to get Mike on the show
the whole time but like this is a guy
that should be able to like get a get a
guy like that and he's not able to and
then you some guy from nowhere who no

[16:00]
then you some guy from nowhere who no
one's ever heard of with one tweet and
you know $3,000 40 hours of work a lot
of passion a lot of motivation a lot of
research so I'm not discounting that but
it all distilled down to a tweet that
got a lot of attention right totally
yeah you like I had you have to do the
work and then you have to publish it and
like I was completely fine taking an L
on this because the whole point of doing
this thing is not for the outcome like
that's the number one thing for these
permissionless projects is like you can
kiss the outcome goodbye if you do it
for the outcome you're already doing it
for the wrong reasons I looked at this
as like hey I'm going to have a dope
pair of shoes like hanging behind me in
my in my office or I'm gonna get to hang
out with like a childhood hero of mine
that's what sounds like a double win to
me so like 40 hours well worth it let's
rock how many views did that tweet get
dude it was like previews this was like
2018 2019 it got like 700 likes and it
got his attention did he DM you no I was

[17:01]
got his attention did he DM you no I was
dming him like crazy like I was dming
all of his camp like IID studied like
his agent I was like following his boys
I was following like his marketing guy I
was like hitting him for all cylinders
like I was dming his wife like it was
crazy like so what was what was like the
nail in the coffin that finally got you
in touch with him Chris Vernon was the
guy Chris Vernon he like intercepted it
was like a Parent Trap moment basically
like Chris Vernon had me in the studio
and was like yo Mike I have a gift for
you if you come to the Stu like it was
like a total like Parent Trap moment and
then yeah we just you were like the
honey pot yeah I was more than happy to
be the Honeypot it was fun yeah so then
you ended up spending the day with him
yeah like we just like I went to shoot
around and like just like was rolling
with the with his posy like I was there
for like and like mind you like 20
minutes before I'm sitting outside with
a backpack with these shoes in my
backpack like I might not you know give
it to him and like he actually rolled up
and walked straight past me and I could

[18:01]
and walked straight past me and I could
have either e easily just like handed
him to him right then but I let him walk
by because I was like hoping that I
would get like linked up like I was
hoping that I would make it into like
the studio you wanted to do it the right
way I wanted to do it the right way like
because you could have just handed him
off he's like cool man thank really
appreciate this and he's gone forever G
gone yeah we wouldn't had the photo
moment we wouldn't have the video like
it would have just been like it would
have been like a premature opportunity
and all the work kind of would have gone
to so like picking the moment actually
matters a ton too so when you were just
hanging with him were people like who's
this Jordan guy like oh he made me these
shoes dude I was literally like just
alone yeah like I was just like I was
like I wish I would have brought some
friends but like I just thought it was
going to be like a quick like G Rogue
situation his like group was taking like
these photos and stuff so it just it was
it was a surreal moment for sure they
say never meet your Heroes was was that
true in this case or was he awesome yeah
it was great like and like all like the

[19:00]
it was great like and like all like the
three other players that were like the
core four were also there so like it was
just an unbelievable like moment to for
me to just like get to like kick it with
them and like and you know speaking of
Paras social relationships again I had a
Paras social relationship with them yeah
so like I could like I could already
jump into like a combo and not be like
you know what they like and kind of like
how they move so it was like chill and
that's why I kind of got to roll it with
for a little bit longer than just like
the handoff let me ask you this when
you're like planning and scheming are
are you just like a dreamer like I don't
know how else to put it are you a
dreamer like you're just hoping that
these things and you're just kind of
fantasizing and visualizing it and then
it actually happens sometimes yeah it's
more like it's more tactical than that
because this was like just an idea that
I had when he got traded and I wanted to
make I wanted to do a creative project
and he was coming back around
Thanksgiving and I knew I was going to
be in Memphis with my wife's family at

[20:01]
be in Memphis with my wife's family at
Thanksgiving so it was just like I was
just like all right this is an
opportunity like let's let's start in
October and just like crank it and crank
and try to make it happen it's really
like tactical we'll get into the the
like tactics of how I how I see these
opportunities did you realistically
think you'd spend the day with him or
did you just want to give him the shoes
was that like the perfect outcome and
then that was exceeded in your mind yeah
exceeded way be Way Beyond like I
literally just wanted to hand him the
shoes and like take and take like a
picture like what you're seeing on
screen yeah like that's like that was it
it's like this was your white whale it
was just like this guy's awesome he's
cool I want to give him these shoes it's
not like I'm gonna launch the next Nike
this is going to be my Launchpad I'm G
to monetize like you weren't trying to
monetize anything you're just trying to
do something cool totally and I think
that's where a lot people get this wrong
too is like they are trying to go for
the outcome they are trying to monetize
they are trying to do it and I think
it's very hard to stay in the game if
you have that mindset of like this is a

[21:01]
you have that mindset of like this is a
this is a a scheme so video is cool but
you know what's better long form audio
via podcast and my newsletter TKO
pod.com go there to subscribe for free
to my newsletter it's one email a week
very tactical and then go to my audio
podcast three episodes a week stuff like
this you're gonna love it all free no
sleazy sales TKO pod.com it rarely
like works out in your favor like that
so we try not to move like that like
ever now you know even if it is like the
dream is to like monetize it I mean
there's a big brand like stelman stable
now they they're a hat brand from New
York and he he did this permissionless
project stuff where he sent hats to the
NBA bubble like he literally just like
sent hats to a bunch of people in the
bubble like without permission and they
spread like wildfire because they all
the NBA players were trapped in a bubble
they saw nothing new they had a pum they
started trading the hats like just like
crazy stuff like that he like yeah now
like monetized and done collabs with the

[22:00]
like monetized and done collabs with the
Knicks and like NBA players and
celebrities but like he just sent
packages well dude did you hear about
the the true brand guy hats guy have you
seen those like upside down Dallas hats
yeah yeah yeah of course like the Dude
Perfect guys wear them they're
everywhere that was just you need to
research that because that's basically
what he did he wasn't calling it that
but he made these hats that just said
Dallas upside down cool design and he
found like I forget his name it was like
some fourth string backup quarterb back
that no one's ever heard of but he had
just got like drafted to the Cowboys and
he booked a hotel across the street from
where he knew they had a meeting and
like ran into him and gave him the hat
for free he wore it in the locker room
everyone asked him about it and then
like then all the Cowboys were wearing
them and then forget about it like all
the NFL was wearing him now the dude now
it's like a huge eight figureure brand
that wasn't like his Grand ambition he
just was just like doing something cool
dude it's beautiful I love it I love
stories like that so like so much I want
to collect I want to collect as many as

[23:00]
to collect I want to collect as many as
I can you should put them in a book man
I am I'm going to one day one day I did
the same thing for Jack butcher again
like with the shoes like I just was like
this guy's incredible like completely
changed like how I view things and so I
was like yo Let's do let's do these
shoes turns out he lived in my
neighborhood no way literally you didn't
even know didn't know no I just like
Lally reached out I was like took his
courses I was like thank you change my
business that I was running at the time
and like build once sell twice as course
that's now a dollar and permissionless
Apprentice which is now a dollar which
everyone should take yeah he was dude
five minutes away we walked to like a
coffee shop and and I handed these off
and like we we become friends since so
for those that aren't watching describe
what you what you made for him yeah so
Jack butcher is visualized value he's
like iconic for these black and white
very simple images that have very
minimalistic design but say a lot with
them so basically created a a Jordan one
with his all black with a black out with

[24:00]
with his all black with a black out with
a white outline for the swoosh and then
some exchangeable tongue tags that were
Velcro with some of his like ju to
position so like the left shoe had one
of them one of the visuals and the right
right shoe had the other one so like you
know decades versus days you know or
this is pointless isn't that one of them
yeah this is pointless is like the one
of his most famous ones I can't believe
you made these shoes
yeah yeah now they're like in his house
and like I go to his birthday party and
he's like dude I still like have these
in you know and it's just like it's just
like a piece of art like he's not
wearing them but like now he's like an
artist like and it's dope to like have
have your art be in an artist house so
have you ever sold your shoes to anyone
I did a like during checks one of Jack's
projects I did like raffle off a pair of
custom dunks and that's the only pair
I've ever sold but I sold those for like
eight grand because I sold like nft

[25:02]
eight grand because I sold like nft
raffle tickets so the nft days yeah the
nft days try to make it as functional as
possible but yeah the coolest most
successful one by far is like what I'm
doing my with my full-time job with Greg
right now is like it was a
permissionless project so like I saw
Greg's tweet I I realized that he only
did a lot of like visual this first
tweet here this first tweet here yeah so
it was basically like a like he's trying
to be visual with this right he's like
it's it says short form video plus
newsletter plus commu free community
plus paid Community plus product is how
you build a business in 2023 so I'm I'm
reading this and like it's got 1,000
likes and I'm like he's clearly trying
to do something visual here but I'm
realizing that he probably doesn't have
time to create a visual so I was like
What if I just created this Visual and
2023 I was like I'm going to do dope

[26:00]
2023 I was like I'm going to do dope
things with dope people I started this
little brand called do within and I I
was burnt out running a Medtech agency
and I was trying to sell it couldn't
sell it because I was like the key man
of it and I was like I'm literally
trying to sell it so I can get out of
here and so I was like I have to stop
because I'm like mad burnt out and I
took a month off and I was like I'm just
going to do dope things with dope people
it was like my month of permissionless
projects and this was January 2nd of
2023 from a nameless account 18
followers I tweet this we're on a
FaceTime within 10 minutes okay so doe
within that was the brand new nameless
account you just went ahead and you
converted his tweet into an infographic
then you tweeted that as like a quote
tweet and then what happens yeah and
then he says like he DMS me love the
image who are you like cuz it was from a
faceless account and I sent him like my
my main account and he was like FaceTime
me and I said we we'll do and like we
just started hanging out and like
jamming on business and we were like he

[27:00]
jamming on business and we were like he
was like what are you going to do next
and I was like I'm not sure here's a
couple ideas of what I'm thinking and he
was like What if you just came and built
at late
checkout and that's been like an
absolute like gamechanging place for me
to find my people and like build
businesses like that I've like dreamed
about building for a long time now built
what like specifically what was the
original goal for you and where did you
end up yeah so I started on a project
called you probably need a robot as like
an entrepreneur in Residence and and
that newsletter when I took it over it
was at like 30,000 subscribers and we
got it up to like 880,000 and monetized
it and did did the whole like AI wave
and then we merged that into startup
Empire our membership community and then
I just joined as like an operating
partner at late check out the holdco
level and just right-hand Manning to
Greg a lot on a lot of different things
like creative Direction on the startup
ideas podcast m&a deals partnership
deals and then like growth and Ops for

[28:00]
deals and then like growth and Ops for
the for the businesses across the board
amazing yeah and this was day two of
your month of permissionless projects
yeah day two yeah it didn't stop there
like I did a bunch of other stuff too
but like this one just hit quick and
like it was the most fruitful by far
yeah so he he's putting out a bunch of
visuals now right are you behind that as
well yeah some of them like a lot of the
sketching ones that we have done like
the hand sketch stuff is like is has all
been from from me but yeah I saw an
opportunity you know it's like how do
you how do you do the the these
permissionless projects is like you look
at like what skills that you have like
what you want to be doing the people
that fire you up and like where that
overlaps with your like passion and
interests and you find the like Keyhole
of of that and it's like what value can
you provide to these people that get you
amped with the skills that you have and
areas that you want to do and like those
are how you see the opportunities it's

[29:01]
are how you see the opportunities it's
like I wanted to collab with someone
like Greg and I was like I can design
kind of I'm not a designer but I can
design like I can see like what he's
trying to do here so like what if I just
did it for him and that open the door
for me to have more strategic
conversations to like actually add value
to his business instead of just like yo
man would love to pick your brain like
got some ideas for you how long did it
take you to make that image 10 minutes
this is a weird question but what
happens if he says FaceTime me and you
get on FaceTime and you're boring and
you're you're just lame talent in the
world yeah you gotta open you gotta it
doesn't work right it doesn't work no
you gotta bring like you gotta be
someone that he wants to hang out with
you do you do but this is like the door
this is the door opener so if I'm
listening to this and I'm boring what do
you do do boring people know they're
boring yeah I think they I think they
might but I think you're interesting to
someone like what the skills that you
have no matter what it's like you're

[30:01]
have no matter what it's like you're
interesting to some like I guarantee you
can find this loophole no matter if
you're interesting or whatever you just
have to study you just have to study up
and like be ready when your number does
get called is that like what is that
like opportunity is like preparedness or
luck is like preparedness meets
opportunity or whatever that KY phras
it's like it's like that but it's just
like being ready for when your number is
called to be interesting just because of
the fact that you liked Greg you liked
his content and his style and you
reached out like that probably means
call 80% chance that he's not going to
find you boring because even in a
parasocial relationship you guys are a
lot alike I see the same like I have a
referral program in my newsletter and so
I hop on calls with people that refer x
amount of subscribers and almost every
call is just a total bro that like I
just bro down with immediately because
it's like the the biggest distillation
of people that like my stuff and
therefore they're most like me they're

[31:01]
therefore they're most like me they're
usually like 30s something white dude we
attend the same church we each have two
to four kids and like we're just like
the same person you know so it's like
just by you don't even need to worry
about that forget I even said that
because whoever you're reaching out to
and you're wanting to add value to
they're probably going to like you
because you like them and it usually
goes both ways yeah 100% And and you
like you are someone who's creating
content all the time I would need an
hour with your content like deeply
studying it to know where I could help
you you know what I mean like just like
reading through the lines crossing over
stuff reading some newsletters seeing
some short form doing all the stuff like
you put your brain into the world it's
very it's it would be very obvious for
me to pluck something that that I could
like help you with if I if I wanted to
get in your space like I think the
biggest opportunity for people listening
is like being a number two to someone
that has a lot stuff going on like it's

[32:00]
that has a lot stuff going on like it's
the most underrated opportunity of all
time is like everyone wants to be a
Creator be the face of something and be
the it's like actually it's dope to be
the number two I would agree with that
like you have a you have a number two
don't you yeah and he's awesome and he's
always top of mind and like we've talked
about a bunch of business ideas and it's
like well I'm always default to like why
don't you do it do you want to start
this and he's like well I and like I
don't want him to because I'm competing
with myself in a way but like he's just
so top of mind cuz we literally talk
every single day he's top of Mind
totally and it's like way to put that's
how I that's how I would like if I was
someone that was trying to like create
opportunity for myself I would be trying
to trying to do that right now what were
some other experiments that month that
didn't go well yeah so I did like a go
to market strategy for Kit convert kit
at the time kit and I did like this
whole like 30 minute like presentation
Loom thing and I like choppered it up in

[33:01]
Loom thing and I like choppered it up in
like a really like high quality like
production and it got viewed like 40
times yeah nothing happened from it like
I know everybody at the company looked
at it once you know or twice they didn't
even say like hey appreciate this no
just ghost 40 views on a loom is a lot
yeah yeah I got passed around for sure I
was like oh it's something's working for
sure but yeah no it's like and then the
the world like comes back around it's
like then I'm getting invited to their
private Mastermind because like we're
kit customers and like we've grown
newsletters and oh so so it has come
back around yeah exactly that's like I
didn't use it for the desired outcome
that I tried to do like I may I wanted
to work at kit maybe because I was like
literally trying to figure out how I
could not work in Medtech at the time I
was like where am I going to go next and
I was like I want to do something and
like the B2B SAS Creator internet
scalable that that kind of was like my
like
constraints so I just started doing

[34:00]
constraints so I just started doing
things for people in that in that space
and it did pay off and like I also used
the exact same go to market strategy on
a pitch to beehive just switch the
brands like you know it's just like was
it the same Loom or did you record it
twice it was different yeah and that was
way scaled down like I didn't do like a
deep bom for beehive I just said like yo
I've got like you know this this and
this this is where I would take beehive
this is how I would turn beehive into a
billion dollar brand like who doesn't
like getting that nothing came from that
either but like now I know the team and
like we've used their newsletters their
newsletter product for a lot of stuff
and it's like that that those two
experience also helped me scale our
newsletters that are like vital and life
Bloods to our businesses now what's
interesting to me if is if the Greg
experiment doesn't go well then the kit
experiment never goes well even over the
long run people view it 40 times but it
never comes back around but because of
the fact that just one one of them
worked eventually it came back around

[35:00]
worked eventually it came back around
does that make sense so it's like this
isn't something that you do once and
like ah it didn't work no it's like you
do it once and it doesn't matter if it
worked and you learn if you do it 20
times and it works three of the times
then over the next five years 13 more of
them might work as well because they can
all kind of interconnect that's it shots
on goal and like it compounds you know
like you're building a portfolio of
these things and their assets and you
become like the person that just shows
up in people's DMS with actual value
instead of uh hey can I pick your brain
it's completely gamechanging even like
when we're doing just like little
partnership stuff like doing a little
just a little thing that's out of the
norm like kind of stand outy it's not a
huge project it takes five minutes
instead of one minute it like you just
get their attention these are the the
four steps that I've kind of like talked
to but like I'm gonna I'm happy to send

[36:01]
to but like I'm gonna I'm happy to send
this to anybody that wants it but it's
like these are like what you need to do
to start seeing like with x-ray vision
opportunities for you to like execute
these these projects so it's like
analyzing what skills you have and like
what do you like to do first off like
you might have a bunch of skills that
you absolutely hate like I would not do
permissionless projects on stuff that
you hate because then you'll be like
getting yourself in a box where you
don't want to be make a list of people
you want to Target it could be customers
people you want work with companies you
want to work at businesses you want to
start and you want to interview
potential clients make a list you want
to Target find the Gap like literally
just like x-ray revision study them
where are they missing things what's on
the bottom of their to-do list that
they're never getting to like I talked
about and then like do the thing and
send it to them and like ask for nothing
in return but be ready with when they do
say like what' you do this for be ready
with a specific like either more value
to add to them or a specific ask
all else equal what kind of things do

[37:00]
all else equal what kind of things do
you think there are to do for these
white whales what kind of tasks it
really depends on like your skills and
on what they do right yeah like where
they have gaps and what your what your
skills are is the thing that you should
do for them yeah I mean like one that
I'm doing right now we'll see if it pays
off is something for David CRA after we
had him on the podcast in Miami he
mentioned and this book that he read
about the founder of Sequoia Capital Don
Valentino and it's like an unpublished
book he was like yeah SE it was 70 pages
and it was a PDF and I hated it I hated
reading it but like gosh it was a good
book it was like so good and I learned
so much from it he just hated reading
PDFs but it was a good book it was like
literally it's a it was a PDF of
pictures of someone taking like of the
book like it was like complete garbage
like listening to him talk uh about that
and then he he mentioned like somewhere

[38:00]
and then he he mentioned like somewhere
his favorite bookstore in Florida I was
like dude I'm going to OCR like like
take pictures of these book and like use
Ai and OCR it and get the transcript I'm
going to typ set it I'm going to do a
print on demand and I'm going to ship
this thing down there with a note that
said thanks for coming to the startup
ideas podcast and I'm going to ship it
to the bookstore that he loves and it's
going to sit behind the desk I called
the guy like the book's about to come in
actually this week so we we haven't it
yet but I I called the the the owner of
the bookstore who he knows I'm like just
keep it behind the desk when he shows up
next time when he checks out like just
give it to him oh my gosh okay so if I'm
David D and I find out it's you somehow
what is the ask for David I actually
don't know you just really like him I
don't have an ask for him but I just
know that if he remembers that like
surprise surprisingly delightful moment
he's going to owe me and us really like

[39:03]
he's going to owe me and us really like
he's going to owe the startup ideas
podcast or yeah he's gonna want to help
us do something and I don't know what
it's going to be I don't care if it's if
it's nothing I like actually just like
really appreciated him like driving an
hour and coming to do the Pod even
though he wanted to and like he was late
to dinner with his wife and like I just
saw the opport to do it and I can only
speak from my experience so I'm like I
feel like I'm just like talking about
the stuff that I do but I just like I
was like this is a doable thing so why
don't we just do it I'm just getting so
many ideas for myself I hope that people
listening are getting ideas like let's
just take everything else out let's say
like the hack the whole permissionless
hack there's only one on the planet and
that's to make a book for someone right
what is the the physical cost 10 bucks
to do this yeah yeah it was like
literally like $9 okay $9
let's say another 10 bucks for shipping

[40:00]
let's say another 10 bucks for shipping
20 bucks how much of your time went into
doing this U like I did the screenshots
on the flight back from Miami so like I
was just like listening to a pod Pro
probably Founders honestly um because I
was like in the Zone on him um and just
screenshotted it and O like I use clean
shot my like screenshot tool that has
OCR baked in and it like was perfect ran
it through AI saw if there was any typos
downloaded a type Setter on the internet
internet for free used this thing called
blurb and it made the book so two hours
called the bookstore five minutes was
the bookstore weirded out no weirded out
okay so let's call it two hours and 20
bucks yeah like we I talk about
asymmetric bets all the time like what
an asymmetric bet I'm over here thinking
selfishly for myself like how can I do
that exact hacked as my permission list
because there's no like there's no end
to permission list like there's always a
bunch of people above you and Below you
right in whatever hierarchy you consider

[41:00]
right in whatever hierarchy you consider
yourself within right so let's say that
my my white whale is to be on the Lex
Freedman podcast or Joe Rogan yeah right
why wouldn't I just take like go to his
YouTube channel sort by most view take
his top 10 put it in like a nice
leatherbound book and mail it to him
what's stopping me what's stopping
anyone from doing that nothing it's just
it's just the idea and like just doing
it you know and like wanting to do it
and like thinking worth the time to do
it it's like I I love saying the phrase
all the time you either win or you learn
right but I'm just I'm going to edit it
for a minute you either win or you learn
or you have a really good story or all
the above yeah it's so it's so fun dude
like doing this stuff like I love
hearing what other people would do like
just hearing that it's like cuz you
learn a lot about people it's like who
do you want to meet who do you want to
hang out with you know what would you do
what would you do for them like it's
such such a good small talk question so
so much better than like what would you

[42:01]
so much better than like what would you
do or what do you do you know right even
though like people people hate when I
ask that because it's like kind of like
intrusive a little bit and it's like
you're like well this guy's like going a
little too deep in small talk you like
skip the small talk yeah well this is
amazing what else do we have on this
presentation yeah I think it's just like
this mindset the mindset shift here is
like like rethinking about like how you
see the the world is like if how do I
meet X versus like how what problem can
I solve for them like how do I get a job
like who who can I make look amazing
what's the application process like how
do I find a third door I think like
sales I think about this a lot it's like
finding a third door in sales like
talking about LCA at the beginning of
this pod we were were doing a a big like
third door Outreach right now to people
that we think are cool and we like made
a physical magazine that's like
beautifully designed chef's kiss on the

[43:01]
beautifully designed chef's kiss on the
design took like multiple weeks to
design it and it's about like designing
products in an AI age and like it looks
so sick and like I can't wait to get one
on my desk but we're we're going to be
sending those out to like potential
prospects so that's so much better than
a LinkedIn DM or that's so much better
than a bumping shoulders at a conference
like hey aren't you the CPO of Microsoft
it's like yeah yeah I don't and I don't
want to be like called that you know man
I wonder what all the best third doors
are that could be a good newsletter or a
whole dedicated podcast like a magazine
a book I posted a job on Twitter once
and like an hour later crumble cookie
showed up at my door from a guy right
like that's a third door you know
finding someone on straa finding them on
venmo and sending them a dollar I've
never even heard the phrase of a third
door but there's a book called the third
door so I'm like didn't create that by
any means I think it's made by a guy
named Alex yeah third door by Alex

[44:02]
named Alex yeah third door by Alex
something so that would be a cool pod I
I thought about that as a pod that would
be it would rip as a newsletter too
because it really just does get like the
creative juices flowing yeah all right
portfolio effect what was that yeah so
this is like why why it works like why
all this works in a very concise way
it's like you connect the dots in
reverse and build a portfolio you're
learning and you have good stories
you're getting in rooms you don't belong
You're Building like transferable skills
and value like that you can reuse on
projects and then you're building a
network with no ask in return and just
it works just like the the Reps reps
matter and then I'm going to write a
book one day on this I'm going to
collect all these stories so if you're
listening and you got a story shoot me a
shoot me a DM I don't know the title
yeah we could it's either you like how I
do on accident you should write a book
not even knowing that this was the last
slide
yeah cold message hot coffee I would
love for it to be like a coffee table

[45:01]
love for it to be like a coffee table
book with like human of New York type
like photography would be cool shoot
your shots super lame this is like the
the design of future books yeah exactly
I love it I'm like I wanted to record
this to amp people up but I'm like my
fingers are twitching to get like Kamal
on the phone to start talking about
ideas of what we could do and like I
know this stuff like I don't know all
this stuff you taught me most what I
just know but like I've been doing this
stuff like bies John McAfee like I've
been sending Loom to Rand looms to
randos for years and I'm usually never
hear back and that's okay like I spent
two years knocking doors in Eastern
Europe I got rejected 50,000 times like
I don't I don't care you know you got to
get over that too that's another thing
is like I heard the phrase maybe just
yesterday it was like Chase the nose
chase some nose you got to go get
rejected that's how you learn you know
yeah like that's the only way to learn
is like get told no and you're like well
why didn't that work how do I get to a

[46:00]
why didn't that work how do I get to a
yes like it breeds Innovation or like
breeds iteration I don't even know the
ls I've taken dude like you just forget
about them you know yeah you do like if
they don't show back up at your door
it's like out of sight out of mind
clearly you didn't matter yeah yeah I
love doing I love doing this like I do
this a lot with like podcasters and like
content that I want to see create like
Riley Brown has like been AI creat
Creator I don't know if you know Riley
Brown he's been doing like AI like
basically like breakdowns on YouTube
just like very very like detailed yeah
he's he's he's really good and just like
good energy guy but I was like dude I
want to see Riley like literally for
three hours use cursor as a
non-developer and so I like tweeted
what's the best way to learn cursor as a
non-developer like going fishing for him
and then like he he commented on it and
like like did a stuff whatever they
commented on it and then I said like I

[47:00]
commented on it and then I said like I
sent him a message and I was like that
was a sub tweet he was like videos
coming Sunday it's just like I just
wanted him to do that it's like and I
like he got like 50,000 views from it
but like I wanted to see it so I like I
basically like prompted the content I've
done the same thing for other other
people too that that hasn't worked out
but maybe one day it will yeah I mean
you wanted to see him do that right yeah
yeah 100% and it worked yeah I was like
I want a threeh hour like movie someone
going Soup To Nuts on curser because I'm
tired of of watching the on hours and
like I've watched like 10 one hour
videos and I'm still not like dialed at
it so like I need one person to walk
through their whole process like so I
can like learn makes me want to try that
as well what what be fun to do the
cursor thing like spend three hours on
cursor hit record and just see if it's
embarrassing I just won't publish but I
probably will anyway dude I think that
that type of content is really
interesting to me right now is like the
behind the scenes like fly on the wall

[48:00]
behind the scenes like fly on the wall
or over the shoulder and it's just damn
easy to create just hit yeah it's so
easy there's like no editing like your
your operator video I thought that was
Cody Sanchez's oh oh sorry you're right
sorry I forgot I couldn't remember who
copied who did attribute me by saying
some guy so we're good yeah you look
like some guy actually yeah yeah I do
yeah like that's some guy yeah but like
that that didn't take you long to record
no did it and it ripped no no it ripped
yeah and like I would that's something
that I do when I'm not recording yeah so
it took no extra time I might as well
hit record which is what you said in the
beginning like you might as well hit
publish if you're doing cool things like
if you're not doing cool things you
should okay now if you're doing cool
things why aren't you hitting publish on
that yeah and like do it in a format
that's frictionless to create you know
like don't be like you need like a to
upgrade your studio and blah blah it's
like dude no no one no one cares like be
a little Loom face in the bottom corner
and like show how the sausage is made

[49:01]
and like show how the sausage is made
and I guarantee you'll find some
interesting people like it'll create a
magnet so it's really fun it's a fun
time fun time to be a builder fun time
to have ideas and it's never been easier
to like make stuff happen a whole
business is that you like a lot of
people listening to this 70% are
aspiring business owners and they listen
because they want ideas like what do I
launch when I launch how do I find
customers okay well here it is like
don't try to find a thousand customers
like try to find one with these
permissionless methods you don't need a
lot of money you don't even need a lot
of time 20 minutes plus 20 bucks you
could have a leatherbound book in the
hands of your your greatest admirer what
are we doing yeah do you does your
audience like want to buy businesses
some of them that's another great way
it's another great way to buy a business
like Boomers are retiring or whatever
they're easy to impress Jordan thank you
where can everyone find you if they want
to buy this book one day get in touch
with you or or be permissionless with
you go full meta X Jr DN M IX you can

[50:03]

find me on LinkedIn Jordan mix too but
those are the main those are the main
places yeah I don't really want you to
buy this book I want you to send me your
cold DMS and success stories so if

success story hit me up and let's
collaborate and crowdsource this book
