all right would you look at this
freaking thing right here you know I
love a brilliant pet idea here's what's
going on here I'm going to tell you why
this isn't a business yet but how you
could turn it into a business and what's
going on this is an aperture 1200X light
it is not cheap the owner of this sweet
dog right here put it outside the window
blast it inside the house all day to
simulate sunlight why because a lack of
natural sunlight for a pet can interrupt
their circadian rhythm so this dude
spent three grand on this expensive
photography light for fake sunlight for
his dog would I do it for my dog no but
will many other millions of Americans do
it for their dogs yes but no one is
selling this product for dog owners
they're only selling it to photography
owners you're telling me if pet owners
spend this this this this and this on
these stupid products they won't spend
thousands of dollars on a light how do I
get a light you literally just Source
them from Alibaba AliExpress you change
out the packaging to be pointed at pet
owners and you mark that crap up you're
oversimplifying it that's too no it's
really that's it I've been importing
crap from China for 15 years you're over
complicating it as a defense mechanism
to not launch something cool get my full
business plan right here
