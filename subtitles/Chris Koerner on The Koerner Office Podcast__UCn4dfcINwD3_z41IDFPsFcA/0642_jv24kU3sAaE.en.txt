look at this freaking thing right here
so I saw this video going on behind me
and the guy advertising these
advertising cans was saying that these
are a great way to make passive income
place them in a shopping mall profit
first of all if anyone promises you
passive income they're lying to you it
doesn't exist second of all nothing
seems passive about this business you
got to negotiate to buy these cans you
got to Wrangle Customs to get them
imported and then you got to be a
full-time salesman to sell ads on them
and then you also got to sell the
shopping malls that may or may not want
to host them that's a very active
business now could this work absolutely
any business could work this is just an
advertising business like owning
Billboards no beef with that but don't
call it passive income
