welcome to the CER office this is the
second part of the Shannon episode that
we started a week ago today today we
speak in a little more generalities
about entrepreneurship how to make your
first dollar what audiences online are
the most valuable how to have resilience
as an entrepreneur some practical advice
for people just getting started in
making money outside of a 9 to-5 we used
an analogy about a slingshot that I
think you'll like and we talked about
compounding so last week we talked about
a lot of specific business ideas and
this week we're talking in more
generalities about entrepreneurship and
how to get started and how to persist
when things get tough but we did talk
about some tactical stuff as well
Facebook groups Etsy opportunities
Airbnb opportunities you're going to
like it enjoy please like And subscribe
share with your friends and we'll see
you next
time I'm glad you brought up the
accessibility part because I'm really
leaning into that as well like it's you
can go upstream or you can go Downstream
right like you can talk about
billionaires or you can talk about side

[01:00]
billionaires or you can talk about side
musles and I like talking about things
that are more accessible it's not as
sexy not as cool what are you working on
right now I often comment people are in
love with the end state of
Entrepreneurship that's awesome and that
attracts me too of course but I feel
compelled to share the work you know and
the little stuff and like we were
talking about earlier it's great yeah
you want to make a million dollars but
let's start with a thousand and let's
get a system because if you make a
mistake at the million-dollar level well
it has a much greater impact on your
life right can't be very negative
because you know can you afford Wipeout
risk maybe in your 20s but could you do
it with your family in your 30s or 40s I
don't think so you get to make those
mistakes on that on the way up and then
you take a little more risk and a little
more risk it's that mistakes or tuition
and you're building your education and
your curriculum along the way so I'm
with you and I'm doing it right now we
were talking about content creation I've

[02:00]
were talking about content creation I've
wanted to productize my knowledge for
ever and just didn't know how to do it
and so now I'm doing it some stuff
doesn't work some stuff works but I
celebrate the small wins the 100 bucks
the thousand bucks that's to me it gives
me energy and I can feel it and it it
makes me want to get up earlier want to
stay up later want to be in front of my
computer more that gives me energy yeah
yeah you know what's really interesting
is I've been on YouTube and so now I
have like data to back up the quote the
value of an audience when you talk about
different things because YouTube will
show like I interview people that are
ultra high net worth and then I
interview people that are making a few
thousand bucks selling garage shelves on
the weekend right everything in between
yep thank you and one thing that I've
noticed because YouTube will break down
your CPM your cost per Mill or cost per
the value of the audience on a per video
basis

[03:00]
basis
and when I interviewed a guy named Matt
who started an Alpine Slide cost him $8
million he's got a bunch of eight figure
hits and he's very interesting very
engaging and the CPM on those videos is
like I'll say RPM because CPM is before
YouTube takes their 50 or 45% cut
Revenue per Mill is what I actually take
home and so you know Mr Beast RPM it's
like two to three dollars a lot of
business channels are like six6 to eight
dollars and when I talk to these ultra
high net worth guys for whatever reason
the RPM on those is like $8 which is
above average it's good when I talk to
the guys doing a side hustle or
something more accessible the RPM is
over $20 is that right like which is
yeah unheard of for YouTube and it's
like why is that reversed and I was
thinking about it and it's like the
people watching this are probably more
likely to take action right of course of
course they're to the point in their

[04:00]
course they're to the point in their
life where like they're already likely
successful they're they're ready to go
to Home Depot and buy a chopsaw they
have money like maybe they're making six
figures in their job but they don't like
their job and they're to the point where
they're ready to take action whereas if
you look at the RPM of like a a
motivation channel that just has like
Elon Musk quotes it's like it's like $4
doll because it's just dreamers they're
not doers what do you think about that I
agree with you and I think that most
people we all strive for something
better we want something better for
ourselves maybe for our kids we whether
it's something we want you know it's a
physical thing or education so whatever
it is there's cost associated with that
your time money and I think that you
know those folks that can watch that and
as as you talk about these actions are
what makes it work and I'll give you an
example it's tactical specific it's it's
not just a great strategy of like talk
about auctions all the time but I don't

[05:02]
about auctions all the time but I don't
say like hey you should go buy this
couch these couch returns from Costco
that sounds like a nightmare to me but I
want you to get in the game and start
studying liquidations and returns
because you can start on a small level
and easier way in you can do it out of
your garage and an easier way out but
when I was running like three or four
companies and making good money and
everything else and then Etsy came along
right and I was like what is this Etsy
man and I was like you know I got some
time in the evenings I had already
started some a couple of companies like
you know I got to figure this out so I'm
studying I'm just up on Etsy I'm just
looking around what's selling that seems
like a lot and I found that these guys
and and women were making these kind of
Steampunk light fixtures out of this
black metal pipe and they look really
cool and I was like man I got a spot I
really like you know what and they're
like $750 they're selling these really
nice big wall things on there I was like
I could totally do that just come on I'm
not so I went and bought all the pipe I

[06:01]
not so I went and bought all the pipe I
was shocked at the pipe to build this
big thing was like 250 bucks got the
wire got these fancy ledd bulbs and I
learned it I was like okay man and I got
I spent probably a week in the evenings
building the first one and I put it up
my house and it's still up in my kitchen
up tucked up between the open beams in
our kitchen and and then I talked to my
wife I was like I'm going to make these
up she's like well how long's it take
are you going to do it I was like well
yeah maybe I don't want to do it but I
could I learned how to do it and you
could have made a few hundred per light
and Managed IT and this kind of thing
but I think it's that Curiosity as well
and the the biggest gift for me to be
being an entrepreneur is confidence like
I've started telling people that want to
be coached I was like really I sell
confidence that you have once you can
make a little bit of money on your own
for some of these businesses and ideas
we're talking about today it changed is
your whole life and your whole framework

[07:02]
your whole life and your whole framework
you talk to people you're more confident
if you have a regular 9 to5 or W2 it's
going to help you there because all of a
sudden you're more confident and maybe
it allows you to speak up and offer
different ideas because you learn
something in your side hustle so I think
the world is just full of people that
want more and your videos coming back
full
circle it just tracks those and my posts
on auctions and three and a half million
people that want to learn about Costco
auctions okay well I know that system
but it's a system it's not just you oh
you should go buy this and do that so I
think that's why yeah where do you think
your confidence came from well when I
got out of college and when I was in
college we talked about this last time
was on your show about flipping trucks
in while I was in school and looking for
the unfair advantage of getting the the
magazine that came out early you built
man you have to solve problems like
crazy when you're doing that stuff and

[08:01]
crazy when you're doing that stuff and
like oh this didn't work or that didn't
work and so when you're
younger I kind of fell in love with
problem solving and because then the
outcome would come and you would sell
that truck make a thousand bucks that
was our whole system can we make a
thousand bucks a vehicle and that built
my confidence a lot and I learned a lot
from I mentioned this before my mom
taught me that reality is flexible it
that was just a part of my upbringing
the whole time is you get to create your
own life your own reality all that stuff
so that helped me build a lot of
confidence and as I started to find a
little bit of success I didn't make a I
don't I would say every business side
hustle I've ever done I don't make a lot
of money in the beginning we were just
congratulating each other for making you
know $100
$150 so that is how I built my
confidence over time when I realized
that I didn't have to have someone else
tell me what to do and no matter what

[09:00]
tell me what to do and no matter what
happened the worst mistakes I have ever
made I could always start over because I
I learned the system of making money I
understood it and I'm a product guy so I
learned the study research find the
Delta between the buy and the sell I
learned the relationship part of it so
that built my
confidence because I'm over here
thinking like it it's almost a chicken
and egg like you kind of have to try and
problem solve and fail to get some
confidence but how do you do all that
without any confidence and I'm thinking
of myself where I got my confidence and
that was knocking 50,000 doors in
Eastern Europe for two years and getting
rejected almost every time so I'm trying
to think of back to us trying to be
tactical and specific what do we tell a
a 25 or a 55y old or anyone in between
that says I want to do this I want to do
what you're doing I want to do
entrepreneurship but I don't really I
don't really like problem solving yet
but I want to like problem solving and I
don't know if I'm confident yet but I

[10:00]
don't know if I'm confident yet but I
want to be confident what do you do with
that yeah like I get DMs like that where
it's like where do I start and
especially when I don't have any money
how do I get started well I think you
have to study you have to research the
way I would start is I would have my
laptop on my lap I just wouldn't watch
Netflix or Tik Tok or what I'd just be
sitting there it's like okay well how
are these people making money go on X or
YouTube or whatever and and just okay in
my case you're Buy buying and selling
stuff and I'm giving all these links to
these auction sites and and then how
much can you access can you put you know
if you don't have any money can you put
a few hundred on your credit card I
don't recommend that but that's what I
did I got 40 credit cards that had
$10,000 each and that was my first line
of credit $400,000 because I believed in
myself and I was young and I was like
well what's the worst that can happen
and so if you study and research it's
boring it's not sexy and this is most
people quit because like in my case I

[11:00]
people quit because like in my case I
look at an auction like I can't make any
money I looked at 10 auctions and I
couldn't make any money on any of those
well maybe you you know change what your
change your framework and just buy
something that you can get your money
back so you could like exercise a muscle
learn it there's a price to pay with my
handbag business that I started I knew
nothing about this stuff at all zero and
so it took me almost a year to really
develop it but the the way I started was
buying from other handbag resellers not
a lot they were I bought cheap bag 50
bucks here whatever 100 bucks just so I
could get the experience how did they
respond to me what emails did I get what
does the box look like what's the
packaging is there a thank you card
inside the Box all those things and then
I created notes I wrote a book because I
was okay I'm gonna do this I know how to
do this I'm this they do this terrible
this is an
opportunity and while I was learning
that I was just researching on LinkedIn
who works for Louis Vuitton can I reach

[12:02]
who works for Louis Vuitton can I reach
out that didn't go anywhere but who's
the big handbag sellers oh that store
can I reach out to Macy's can I reach
out to Bloomingdales yes I reach out to
a guy and said what do you do with your
returns or overstock and he turned me on
to the Macy's liquidation website and I
that's where I started and they were
mostly garbage but I don't know if I
mentioned but you're further along
you're further down the road yes yes yes
you're swimming Upstream think of that
as as fish you're swimming constantly
upstream and you don't know where you
will wind up right most people you're
making progress yes you're making
progress you're getting that little
thing as you're learning and you're
building this foundation and I think the
you have to congratulate yourself on the
small wins the little achievements oh
look I got my resale
permit awesome that's huge you don't
know 99% of the people won't even do
that right and I've got a business
license and I cleared out a corner of my

[13:00]
license and I cleared out a corner of my
garage and put some racks like that rack
guy that you posted about you built some
racks and so you can stack stuff in
there check check write it down I I
don't like to-do lists I love to did
lists that I can write down what I did
it makes me feel like I've achieve more
right so I see what I got done today I
got this i got this i got this that's
what I would do to get started it's a
mental game right it's definitely a
mental game all right if you are
watching this clip right now you are
watching this on YouTube and if you are
a fan of podcast please check out my
podcast while you're at it because
sometimes I have podcasts that aren't on
YouTube and sometimes I have YouTubes
that aren't on podcast so check out the
Kerner office on any podcast platform or
you can go to TKO pod.com also my
newsletter will throw that in there
there are no ads It's weekly it's
different content than my podcast and
YouTube newsletter. chrisj cerner.com
You'll see the link and we'll see you
there each one of those steps like they
pick up a book and they're 20% more
likely to get there all right now they
go get a credit card and they're 40%
more likely then they go buy some to
clear out the garage to buy something

[14:01]
clear out the garage to buy something
they're 130% more likely to get there
then they get their reseller certificate
and it's like their success is just
compound in in an exponential way not in
an incremental way no it's exponential
you you that's right and you might even
say the first step is 120% more likely
and then after that it's like 30% and
40% and 30% I think you just answered my
question and this is a question I've had
for a while which is like how do you get
started and I'm thinking to a lesson
that I learned at church which is like
how do you have faith well you have to
start with a desire to have faith that's
right right if you don't have a desire
then you'll never get it right once you
have a desire pretty good chance you'll
make it and so yeah anyone that DMS us
saying how do I get started I don't have
any money okay there's something there
here you go yeah but I think the the
research yeah yeah it's definitely and I
think you have to you can't just want it
you have to decide you just have to
decide that this is my own this is going

[15:01]
decide that this is my own this is going
to happen and for one reason or another
when my kids were little and I was like
oh I don't want them to go to a
government school we just decided
they're going to private school and I
was like man I don't have the extra
thousand bucks a month so we had to
start a business to generate the
thousand bucks a month and we did it and
but we worked every night from 10: to
midnight for over a year before I could
bring some before we made 500 bucks a
month we weren't at the Thousand yet
took like a little over a year year and
then I once we made 500 bucks I hired
somebody to do the work and I paid them
the 500 bucks because it was only about
an hour so a day and then as the site
grew it started kicking off money took
more time we paid that person a little
bit more it was probably two years
before I could take a th000 bucks a
month right but eight years later it was
generating $30,000 a month and that's
how you start you start I got my wife
involved because I got her Buy in
because she say hey we're in this
together and we decided to do this it

[16:00]
together and we decided to do this it
wasn't we want be really nice if we
could send our kid to private school no
we decided it was the way and we did it
we went in the hole for the first couple
years and then we crawled out so it is
exponential the analogy I really like is
all this stuff is like a slingshot and
as you start there's just this rubber
thing hanging there everything you do
you're pulling back and you're pulling
back and pulling back and pulling back
and at some point in your life and for
you know we've had a great life but for
me and it always made you know good
money but that slingshot that I pulled
tight tight tight tight for like I
didn't Rel get to release it and really
blow my life up until I was in my 40s
because EV everything came together of
all these people I knew and all these
resources I had and I had a building and
I had this and I had a forklift and I
had all these employees and so that
little start is that you have to decide
to do it it's so interesting because
there are other guys on Twitter or in
the business world that hear stories
like that I P it back for 20 years and I

[17:00]
like that I P it back for 20 years and I
didn't let go until I was in my 40s and
some people take that information
influencers and say business is freaking
hard man it's a lot harder than you
think like just if it's if you think
it's too hard for you keep your job man
just keep your job like that's probably
for you they take this really negative
approach to it because people aren't
willing to put in the work people just
don't have the self-control people
aren't Grinders they don't and it's like
I hear that same story and it's like you
can do it you can't do it man it will
always take longer than you think yes it
everything always but like you can do it
because it gets easier as you go it does
get easier that's a great that's very
important to point out yeah because as
you stack these skills up as your talent
stack increases it just helps you with
everything else so that's crucial that's
crucial some of the people that they DM
us how do I start and then go do
research yeah and I feel like that's the
first litmus test it costs $0 and if

[18:01]
first litmus test it costs $0 and if
they're doing the research and they're
like procrastinating that and you and I
just said we're both procrastinators
right yeah for sure if they're
procrastinating their research and
they're treating like a homework
assignment and then they research a
little bit and they don't really like it
to me that's a signal that they like the
idea of Entrepreneurship but they're not
going to actually like it right still
important that they did the research
they can check the box but on the other
hand if you start doing the research and
you're energized and you're not
procrastinating it and you're staying up
late and you're digging and you're going
down these rabbit holes this is going to
be for you like you got to persist
because you will like it it is fun it's
fun and I think that in the beginning
you have to give a lot of energy I'm
sure I mentioned this last time but I'm
GNA say it again because so important to
me you're just grinding when you're
tired and you don't want it it's like
going to the gym you're burned out you
know whatever you got a headache you
know this TR but you're giving lots of
energy but as you start to find stuff
and things start to come together
these things give energy back to you and

[19:01]
these things give energy back to you and
that's where you get to that point where
you want to stay up later you want to
get up early you want to do these things
and that's what I looked for I tried to
start a software business and it was a
disaster and 11 12 months into it I was
like this is exhausting dude it it gives
me nothing and then my guy that you know
I hired to help kind of bailed out on
the project and I was thinking I'm not
into this but I had all this content and
I was like okay now I can repurpose this
and do something else with it and went
up publishing the Posh Marco lock book
because I'd learned this system and
pushing it so look for the energy look
for when it starts giving you energy
back that's a a sign that things are
working I like that yeah so what ideas
are giving you energy today is there
anything you're particularly excited
about or something that you're not even
going to capitalize on but you think
that someone else should yeah I think I
still love the Etsy stuff I think that's
a still under valued Market everybody is

[20:00]
a still under valued Market everybody is
can easily make something and you don't
have to make it until they buy it that's
what I love you just have to make some
samples or whatever and you can put it
up there no risk doesn't cost you much
and I think that's if you're creative in
any way or you have something to offer I
think that's
amazing another thing I really like
because I've been doing some research on
this is you know is the Airbnb local
guides if you live in San Francisco or
you live in Dallas or whatever and
people are coming to Dallas Fort Worth
from another country why don't you go
take them around take them all the show
them the best spots the restaurants
whatever and people are making very good
money at it's a side hustle it's like
driving for Uber but it's that same
thing it gets you thinking on another
level and you can offer all kinds of
stuff and actually I noticed Airbnb guid
selling like content like guides like
okay we come in and then I have this and
you could have different levels I'll
come take you around for the day and
it's 500 bucks or I'll give you these
guides to the DF FW area and these are

[21:00]
guides to the DF FW area and these are
all the things that I grew up with or
this kind of thing I think that's
fascinating to me easy right interesting
not easy but accessible right you have
you have to yeah you have to create that
stuff one thing that drives me crazy
constantly with our vacation rentals is
property management and cleaning
services highly undervalued opportunity
because everybody hates their cleaning
services everybody I talked to just go
to into up in Facebook and start
searching for like I'm in the Tahoe area
but if you search other touristy areas
you'll see everybody I need a new
cleaner they didn't do this they didn't
do that they didn't do this kind of
stuff I think it's a big opportunity and
there's tons of guys up on X selling
like their courses and stuff on how to
start virtual cleaning businesses I
would start talking to those guys
because but I would focus I I think the
opportunities in vacation rentals I
think the shine is off of that business
right now in general yeah but we use
them in a different way we only buy

[22:00]
them in a different way we only buy
vacation rentals for places we want to
go stay and so I use this I call it
slippery math so you get a bunch of
depreciation yeah you cover the costs of
all your the properties that you're
buying but you get to go there three
four or five times a year and it's
amazing that kind of stuff so for free
yeah yeah yeah that's right that's right
what would you say if someone wanted to
start like a cleaning company
specifically for airbnbs and as you said
it is hard I've had an airb BB2 and is
is is it possible that someone starts
that and it's so hard like they have all
those headaches that you're talking
about and it turns them off from
entrepreneurship entirely or does that
just Harden them and make the next one
even easier it could go both ways but
back to the way your the framework the
Outlook if you're listening to this and
we're talking about these specifics
you're going to hear these underlying
terms and the systems we're talking
about and a big part of it is optimism
and looking at things a certain way you

[23:02]
and looking at things a certain way you
could pick aart go look at the comments
on Chris's posts and on mine there's
always people in there telling you why
it won't work well I don't want to hang
out with those people I want to hang out
with people that are like I want to try
this how do I learn more you know
because that's interesting and fun and
that makes life great right and I'm
definitely one of those our best days
are ahead of us people so can you teach
optimism I don't know but I hope we're
teaching that a little bit and
so yes it's going to be difficult yes
you're going to have headaches and
problems and people are tough to deal
with but if you can figure out what is
the difference in my solution that may
others are not offering maybe you just
offer a super coner high-end service
you're the most expensive in that area
but you bring flowers and a bottle of
wine for the next guest and all these
kind really distinguishing yourself in a
way that you're not not selling a
commodity service like cleaning which

[24:01]
commodity service like cleaning which
probably a commodity so that's the way I
would look at it and yes you're going to
fail but you just have to keep zigging
and zagging to get through it yeah
anytime I'm doing market research let's
say I'm in a Facebook group for Airbnb
owners there's a lot of those yeah I
find that the magic is not in the post
the magic is always in the comments and
you can find thirdparty tools that will
export the comments to a spreadsheet and
then you can upload the spreadsheet to
chat GPT and just say what are all the
commonalities or make me a word cloud
from this spreadsheet thousands of
comments and it's like late late late
late late it's like wow they just want
people to be on time and if no one's
complaining about expensive then it's
like okay everyone's cheap no one wants
to pay more if you could solve that
problem maybe I can be more expensive
yeah that's it is you are you want to be
like hey yeah we're the Premier Service
our prices is this are this for a reason
we have a big place up there that it's

[25:00]
we have a big place up there that it's
basically 500 bucks every time we turn
it around right and so jez but they they
miss stuff all the time and it's like
it's such a simple that I don't run that
business my wife does so I take I'm her
employee there so I try to make
recommendations but it works out he does
that and after if you've worked with
your spouse having a separation of
Duties is crucial I can be a
micromanager that's not a good thing for
your wife so I walk around and go this
is so simple that to organize this and
to they don't even have a checklist like
every room and little things that are so
easy like every TV needs to be turned on
to be sure it's working every time you
clean the house because it's all
streaming services now it's not just the
way it used to be and did somebody take
the remote did the remote need batteries
we're selling a a pre premium we rent
this place out for, to $1,500 a night
we're trying to sell a premier
experience right and
you have to look at all that stuff

[26:00]
you have to look at all that stuff
because then you get a call from the
guest that says the 75in TV doesn't turn
on and we can't watch the football game
that's a big problem that's a big
problem and they miss that stuff do be
crazy I think the best way to start a
more difficult type of business is to do
everything yourself in the beginning and
I wouldn't recommend that for a lot of
businesses but like you know what this
house is going to take me 7 hours to
clean and I'm going to do it 100% myself
for a month's straight and I'm going to
know everything about that house so that
way I can ensure that the quality is as
good if not better than what I was doing
because a lot of people they buy these
courses and these programs and they buy
into the sex appeal of not doing
anything managing properties from across
the globe and I've owned a cleaning
business it was freaking hard hard yeah
but I did it that way I never cleaned
one house yeah yeah and I could tell you
my we just we bought a place recently up
along a river here it's like 5 acres has
a couple houses on it and my wife

[27:01]
a couple houses on it and my wife
cleaned the house for the first few
times it's about 2 hours away from us
like okay I'm going to go up because she
needed to understand everything that was
going on to build the guide to give to
the cleaner and the person that hey you
need to do this and this is the way you
do the sheets because that's how you
make a bed in a hotel this is what we
want to do all all that kind of stuff I
do everything manual in the beginning
and then I start looking for ways to
automate because I don't know it I don't
know it enough to
to building some courses and stuff on
kajabi and yeah I have some help but I
said I need to build one I need to
understand how to solve these issues and
what's the pain points and what works
and what doesn't I'm I'm a big fan of
that yeah I think it's I think it's
important the reason there's Facebook
groups full of people complaining about
their cleaning business and no one's
complaining that they don't have a
Chrome extension that tracks when their
emails are opened is because it's really
really easy to build the ladder right
from comfort of your room anywhere in
the world and it's really hard to go

[28:01]
the world and it's really hard to go
clean a house by yourself with your own
two hands which means there will always
always be opportunity in businesses that
require some sort of a manual labor
because it fights human nature yeah yeah
okay that's it for the Shannon episodes
I'll probably have him on at least once
a month or so let us know in the
comments if I should and I think you'll
agree that we should so have a good week
