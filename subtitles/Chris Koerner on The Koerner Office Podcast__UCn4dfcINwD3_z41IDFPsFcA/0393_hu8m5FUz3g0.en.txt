[00:00]
had you even knocked a door when you
quit your job I gave myself about 6
months now the business has replaced my
income that I had from that W2 the first
two months were we got to profitability
within two months I did a $6,000 job
what's going to be your profit on that
$6,000 job how many jobs have you had
give or take so far what has your
Revenue
[Music]
been okay so tell me about your
business yeah so I started true line
striping which is a pavement marking
company here in Waco Texas I just
started it a few months ago so oh wow
still fairly new to it myself but yeah
and we provide new layouts and parking
lot rpes primarily for businesses that
are looking to enhance their curb appeal
and stay compliant with all the fire
codes and Ada accessible codes and
whatnot okay so I got to know like what

[01:00]
whatnot okay so I got to know like what
what made you even start thinking about
this industry because I would bet even
like entrepreneurs like myself 80 90% of
them don't even know this industry
exists so it's not like I from a young
age grew up and just wanted to throw
pain on the ground it was more of a of a
hey I want to own a business what
businesses are needed in my area sort of
thing and my background is in
construction so I wanted to do something
that was construction adjacent I'd done
residential and Commercial building so I
I feel like I had a decent enough
experience working with different
subcontractors and there weren't there's
there's maybe I would say one big player
in this market but there it I really
don't think it's a saturated market for
line striping specifically in Waco or
anywhere specifically in in Waco here in
Waco I can go in hour and be in Temple
Bel and cleen that whole Market as well
so essentially I was actually looking at

[02:00]
so essentially I was actually looking at
buying a business and so came across a
franchise that was trying to sell a
striping business here in wo and went
down that path for a couple months
realized you know what I think I can do
this a lot more cheaply and have a lot
more options down the road if I were to
do it by myself so ended up launching it
myself okay so you're the sole owner
sole founder yes and you were doing
construction beforehand like as a as a
W2 yes yeah so I was worked my way from
being a assistant superintendent up to
being a project manager kind of with
various different companies but yeah I
was working under a general contractor
okay did you have to quit that entirely
to start this or did you like roll into
it I did not have to but I did there
there are some other line stripers that
I know of across the country who hold
their W2s and my my mindset is such that
I I feel like I wouldn't be able to do
either of them very well if I was

[03:01]
either of them very well if I was
constantly being torn and my my W2 job
on me it was it was at least a 40h hour
week job you know and so I feasibly I
could have just done like organic
marketing and gotten leads without me
going door too which is a lot of what
I've been doing as I am still pretty
young in this business I could have just
let leads grow on their own but I wanted
to kind of Hit the Floor running and
just launch and get after it and be able
to dedicate the majority if not all of
my week towards it good for you I feel
like that's so rare I speak out of both
sides of my mouth so I wrote a
newsletter a year ago I remember I was
in New York it was like 3:00 a.m. I
couldn't sleep I went in the bathroom
pulled out my MacBook and it was called
burn the boats and it was just talking
about like when there's no plan B plan a
just thrives right but that's hard
that's hard to do like plan a has to
work I've been forced to burn the boats

[04:00]
work I've been forced to burn the boats
twice because of Once A Part both
honestly Partnerships went bad and when
you start 75 businesses you're gonna
have some bad Partnerships yeah and you
know that wasn't a w a willful decision
like you made nonetheless like I only
had one option left when that happened
and like what I did after those moments
were the two biggest and best things
I've ever started that's awesome so yeah
yeah and definitely just kind of knowing
my motivation what gets me gets me going
gets me out of bed and being able to to
devote my time to this and there was
there was about I give my employer about
a month heads up and I had even told him
before then like hey just so you know I
kind of have this edch to go out on my
own or do my own thing so he was aware
but there was a couple weeks overlap and
even that just like couple weeks overlap
I'm like gosh I feel so torn but yeah
I'm I'm glad that I'm able to devote all
my time to this now yeah and on the
other side of my mouth I always counsel

[05:00]
other side of my mouth I always counsel
people like just do something like go
buy a domain go find a customer don't
quit your job I use an analogy called
The W the wing Walkers code you know the
guys that like walk across the the
airplane wings and they hold like they
never let go of a crossbar until they
hold the one the next one and so I
totally counsel people to do that
because for 80 90% of people like if
they have to quit to start something
they're never going to start something
the next best case scenario is to do
something now while you have your job
not just to drisk but to ensure that you
actually do something yes right so it
just depends on your situation yes so I
don't know if I would as a blanket
statement would advise anyone to do this
yeah no it sounds it's like very
clickable to like take a hard stance on
one side or the other but you know life
is is lives in the gray area right so
you didn't have any customers when you
quit your job is that correct that's
correct that's crazy and what type of

[06:01]
correct that's crazy and what type of
assets what types of assets did you need
to buy to launch and how much did those
cost so I bought a 16 by7 foot trailer
that's
enclosed and and that was 7,000 and I
bought that new and I bought a line
striper so it's just a walk behind
machine that has a spot where you can
put a 5 gallon bucket and a Honda motor
and a pump and that's how you actually
apply the the paint stripes so and that
that was about
10,000 okay so 16 by S foot just like a
box trailer right like you'd rent from
from U-Haul yes 7 grand for that 10 10
grand for the striper that's brand new
yes yeah both those are brand new and I
use my personal truck so you truck with
a hitch $117,000 worth of equipment some
paint you're in business yes it's not
bad that's that's less than what I

[07:00]
bad that's that's less than what I
thought it would be and I imagine you
you can surely finance a a trailer but
could you finance the machine as well
yes you could if you wanted I I was able
to buy them out right so that I chose to
do that route but yes you can Finance
both of those how much runway like
savings Runway did you have when you
quit I gave myself about six months I
told myself you know what I'm not going
to take money from the business for the
first six months and give myself six
months to build it up to where okay now
the business has replaced my income that
I had from that W2 and we're still
within that six months and we're we're
on track the first two months were were
definitely better than expected wow yeah
we we got to profitability within two
months so you're in month three right
now I'm in month three okay oh I just
love everything about this story so your
overhead you don't have any payments I

[08:00]
overhead you don't have any payments I
assume you don't have a payment on your
truck correct no payment on my truck
working out of my house yes my I just
know the type of guy that pays cash for
a $10,000 you know paint striper machine
is the type of guy that doesn't have a
loan on his truck so exactly okay not
that there's anything wrong with that
right all right so your margin is just
your your cogs is just the paint yes and
your time right and I'm still building
up stencils are another like upfront
cost but I try to build those into the
quotes that I'm generating so as I need
a handicap stencil I build that into the
quote but now I I probably have $2,000
worth of just stencils now okay so
stencil you buy once and you basically
use forever yes okay so your first
handicap job you got to go buy a stencil
for that and you should keep using it
okay how many stencils do you have and
like what types you have a No Parking
fire line stencil you have

[09:00]
fire line stencil you have
we're in Texas handicap man stencil you
have your number stenc stencils visitor
Reserve stencils I needed to get a
service one for this fast food
restaurant drive-thru that I was doing
you get all your directional arrows um
yeah you get some stencils they're more
like they're not scrap stencils but for
your wheel stops those are the the ones
that I have right now okay you must
drive around town and just look at
parking lots be like a what a crap
stencil job this guy did or oh I could
buy that that's a good looking stencil
I'm going to need that eventually okay
yeah all the time no me and my wife
since I've started this we we say we're
both parking lot snobs
now you're like babe we can't go we
can't go here this stencil job is
terrible exactly yeah the chicken must
be bad too
right okay all right so you quit your
job and had you even knocked a door when
you quit your job when I told my boss
hey I'm I'm moving on to this I had not
talk to anyone in within that four-month

[10:01]
talk to anyone in within that four-month
period while I was still working of
course then I'm starting to get my name
out and actually sold a couple jobs
during that interim period or that
overlapping period and the the first
jobs that I sold I sold them at a
discount told them what I'm doing hey
just starting out and honestly trying to
build my Google review page and and
since then and I'd say maybe the first 3
to four weeks pretty much all my jobs
were discounted pretty heavily
some of them were essentially at cost if
it's a smaller job I would only charge
two or 3 hundred bucks and that was
essentially at cost for me but then the
others all do a 40% discount to where
maybe I make a little bit profit or 20%
discount and then it's like okay now now
I'm like really marketing you know and
now I'm at the point where I'm I'm not
offering discounts anymore I don't feel
the need to but yeah so that that's kind
of how I how I started out okay so let's
I I want to talk about how you got your
first customers but first I want to talk

[11:00]
first customers but first I want to talk
about unit economics so tell me what
like a small medium and a large job
looks like both from a revenue and a
profit and a time invested standpoint
sure so a small job would be like a gas
station so call it between five and 10
spots has one adaa stencil so a lot of a
lot of guys will do job minimums and
those minimums generally range from 300
to 5 or 600
$ so that's your minimum job and for
that so a five gallon bucket of paint is
around 150 bucks geez so if you don't if
if you already have the stencil which in
this case you would only need the Ada
stencil you have 150 bucks worth of
paint you're only going to use like two
gallons of that two maybe three gallons
on a job like that okay and how much is
the stencil the the stencil the Ada

[12:00]
the stencil the the stencil the Ada
stencil I think it was around $100 on
average stencils are are about a 100
bucks some are less but you're GNA use
them over and over yeah and so for that
job if you're putting in $100 worth of
paying and you're charging 400 bucks
then you got 75% margins on the gross
essentially and it it would take
you depending on how far you live from
it or where your shop is from it an hour
of drive time and no more that should
take you no more than two hours to
complete it okay so $150 for5 gallons of
paint you're going to use two gallons
that's 30 bucks in paint your stencil
let's say you use it a 100 times over
its lifetime that's $1 so you're in $31
we won't count drive time because that's
variable but two hours of Labor so two
hours to make
$369 bucks
profit that's not bad no so that's like
180 bucks an hour of profit which is

[13:03]
180 bucks an hour of profit which is
like 360 Grand a year of like if you
just did if you did that for eight hours
a day 40 hours a week five days per week
that's you're making 360 Grand only
doing small jobs and I'm sure the larger
jobs get even more profitable with no
employees it's not a bad living you pay
off your equipment first couple months
right yeah definitely okay all right so
small job gas station one one thing that
you do need to consider is that people
use parking lots during regular business
hours so a lot of this work has to take
place in the middle of the night or at
least after 5:00 pm yep you do have
those jobs churches restaurants that are
closed Monday Tuesday you do it like
offices that you can work in during
regular business hours but that is okay
thing that you need to consider how long
does it take for the paint to dry
depends on what paint you used I only
use solvent based paint which dries much

[14:01]
use solvent based paint which dries much
much quicker so a couple hours what do
you do while it's drying do you block it
off and then leave you can set up cones
if I finish a job at two in the morning
then like go I'll just leave like no
one's going to be there till 6: a but
generally and it depends so like when
you're painting like an ADA stencil that
blue square that takes up a lot of paint
so you do that first generally like once
you get to a job do that first go ahead
and stripe your Lines by the end once
you're done striping the lines you come
back and spray the white or yellow Ada
stencil on it and it's dry by that time
and then it doesn't take as long for
that white paint to dry just because
it's it's essentially surface are strip
yeah do you have to like adhere the
stencils to the ground no you just lay
them down it's like a it's I forget what
it stands for it's the like heavy duty
plastic material it's like a E8 inch

[15:00]
plastic material it's like a E8 inch
thick and it's heavy so it's not
flapping in the wind but it just lays
there so so you only need stencils for
the icons or whatever and then you you
use the machine for the stripes what do
you use for the stencils do you like a
roller so the machine has it's a spray
gun that's mounted on the the line
striping like machine so you can take
the gun loose and just freehand it spray
the stencils from the same bucket of
paint with that same gun yeah now can
the machine hold multiple colors of
paint no so paint changes is something
you have to factor in I know that there
there's guys across the country where
they will charge for the paint change
like if if you're doing a business where
you have to do white parking lines of
blue Ada stencil and red fire line
they'll charge you 200 bucks just
because it's going to take them an hour
worth of paint changes because you have

[16:02]
worth of paint changes because you have
to like run run a acetone through the
machine between colors that way you get
the machine fully cleaned so you don't
have paint that's coming out purple if
you're going red so could could you not
have just a second hose and nozzle that
you swap out so the a lot of people will
get a separate machine and have them DED
have
dedicated so with one machine you're
forced to do a paint change but yeah my
goal is to get a second machine as soon
as possible so you're spending an hour
currently to swap out the paint but
you're not charging for it yet that's
correct okay where does where do all the
chemicals go like the paint when you you
clean it out of the hose you have to
like dispose of it properly yeah so you
just keep using it and then pay for a
recycling you're just like spraying it
back in the bucket exactly yeah you
cycle it through the machine and so you
can use you can use uh a lot of the time

[17:01]
can use you can use uh a lot of the time
I'll just put gas through the machine
and that cleans it up because gas is a
lot cheaper than
acetone and so you can just cycle the
gas through the machine put it in your
your trash bucket and then next time you
need to do a paint change sure it's not
100% gas there's some pain in there but
it's it's way more gas and it's not
enough to clean it up interesting all
right so two hours for a average size
gas station right not a bies not like a
big RAC trck or quick trip like a
smaller gas station right okay now what
about a medium job so a medium job I
would say the ones that come to mind
probably in the 1,000 to $2,000 range
and this is like your your office you're
like like I think there's a dentist
office we have it's 30 spots it's 30 or
35 spots I recently did it it also had
some fire lane it had I think they had
two adaa spots um that was a $2,000 job

[18:05]
two adaa spots um that was a $2,000 job
wow yeah are you are you quoting by the
square footage or by the number of
parking spaces or what how does your
math look I quote by the linear foot
okay so yeah the linear line foot yes
yeah so you a parking space a parking
line is generally 18 feet long so you
count up the number of spaces say you
have 10 spaces 180 linear feet you price
kind of between there and Prices range I
mean I know markets are very different
but can range from 30 cents a linear
foot to 80 cents a linear foot and that
would be for a restrip if it's a new
layout like a new build is going up but
then you have to factor in your layout
costs because you have to figure out
where all those you don't want it to you
you don't want it to look like crap
right you got to measure it right and
align it and so rrap you're just you're

[19:01]
align it and so rrap you're just you're
painting in the colors you're just it's
easy you know where the paint is going
and you just line up your laser and go
right over it all right if you are
watching this clip right now you are
watching this on YouTube and if you are
a fan of podcast please check out my
podcast while you're at it because
sometimes I have podcasts that aren't on
YouTube and sometimes I have YouTubes
that aren't on podcast so check out the
ker office on any podcast platform or
you can go to TKO pod.com also my
newsletter will throw that in there
there are no ads It's weekly it's
different content than my podcast and
YouTube newsletter. chrisj cerner.com
You'll see the link and we'll see you
there okay so one to two grand for a
dental office couple adaa symbols 60
spots what would that job cost if it
were not a restripe if that was not a
restripe then it would cost about 1.5 to
2x wow okay does it literally just tast
take about twice as long it doesn't I
wouldn't say it takes twice as long it
just takes more more thought has to go

[20:02]
just takes more more thought has to go
into it it's hard to work you have to
have another guy with you you can't do
that job solo because you're popping
chalk lines figuring out exactly where
all all the lines are going and thens
prep work that's required moving things
out of the way all that stuff do you
prefer those jobs or hate them because
they're annoying I honestly I like the
variety I like going I like having them
sprinkled in but it's nice when you can
knock out like two minimum jobs and one
evening you know that's your day so yeah
I'm just comparing it to like painting
my house and like getting it all just
right and I like I I do Woodworking and
make beds and tables and like that's the
worst part of it for me the finishing
okay so what does a big job look like so
a big job those are generally your new
layouts there was a tattoo parlor that
went in recently that was a $5,000 job
and I'd say big job range from $5,000 to

[21:01]
and I'd say big job range from $5,000 to
$20,000 that was no more than 40 spots
but it had fire lane it had a lot of
pedestrian zones so I had the like angle
Barns and I also do sign installs too so
I'll actually put the sign post in with
the adaa sign on it I'll do that as well
that this um job had a couple of
those and then yeah so that's kind of
your larger job and there's a car wash
that I'm doing that's getting built down
the road that's going to be a $10,000
job and same thing they have they have
more wheel stops getting installed is it
common for striping companies to do the
signage as well or is that kind of a
youth thing it's pretty common for that
to be included okay what is the biggest
job you've ever done the biggest job
that I've done to date is that $5,000
job the okay biggest proposal I've
gotten accepted is the $10,000 job for
the car wash and that'll be next month
that was a good day huh yeah definitely

[22:02]
that was a good day huh yeah definitely
oh no I did a $6,000 job that I'm
wacking up this week actually what's
going to be your profit on that $6,000
job so the $6,000
job we have to use $3,000 worth of
material so this was a lower percentage
margin more cash about
35% okay okay so you're still making a
couple great
MH from it and how long will that take
two days okay hour like full days yeah
okay man okay all right so let's talk
about your first customer or two how did
you get them what was the conversation
like were they worried that you're a new
guy or you just like listen if I screw
up this line I'm just gonna fix it or
hey you know I went to my driveway and
I'm I'm an expert at line striping now
because you should see my
driveway no I mean there's not so the

[23:01]
driveway no I mean there's not so the
how I got my first
customers were jobs that I was actually
the like project manager on I told them
hey like can we were doing small
renovation jobs for them told them hey
I'm starting this company so it was
Prior connections were my first two jobs
my third job was
a auto shop so and I needed to get my
truck service there so I told them what
I was doing told them I would give them
a discount they're like yeah we were
actually thinking about getting that
done sure work up a quote for us and of
course I gave them a great deal that
they went with me and it was it was good
and yeah on those on those first couple
jobs I'm glad that I gave them a
discount I would probably do a better
job today than I than I did two months
ago you drive by that autoshop and just
cringe it yourself yeah and it I mean
it's not bad it could be better lines
but to your standards yes
yes exactly so I think that offering a

[24:03]
yes exactly so I think that offering a
discount is key and also I trained with
someone who was in Oklahoma so they were
far enough out of my market they did not
see me as a competitor I trained with
them for a few days so I I got used to
the the striping motion what guard rails
does the machine have to make sure that
you go straight how hard is it to do a
good job with the equipment that you
have so the front wheel so it's a
three-wheel machine two in the back one
in the front that front wheel has a
Caster that locks in place granted if
you apply more pressure on the left then
it'll go towards the right if you send
vice versa so you need
to apply consistent pressure if there's
any it's a heavy machine it's a couple
hundred pounds so it's a heavy machine
especially if you have five gallons of
paint sitting on top of it so if there's
any slope to the surface then it's going

[25:02]
any slope to the surface then it's going
to pull that way so they have a laser
dot that you put right on the edge of
where the fan is gonna be applying paint
so you have to focus on getting that
right on the edge of the either existing
paint line or if it's a new layout right
on that chalk line that you popped you
got to be focusing the whole time yeah
it takes 100% of your
attention okay all right so I love that
you said your first couple jobs came
from a network because I always counsel
people to do that like you if you any
business you start there's someone in
your circle that's willing and able to
support you financially right so I love
that that was your first two jobs that
made your third job which was really
kind of your first like your first job
to a stranger right right so much easier
because you had a track record right you
know they didn't have to know that you
had a connection with them it didn't
matter it meant that you were a little
more experienced than you were before
how are you acqu customers on a regular

[26:00]
how are you acqu customers on a regular
basis like moving forward today so a lot
of what I'm doing how I've gotten 90% of
my customers still has been door
knocking and like they they don't know
about true line striping you know sure
they need the service done then they're
getting it done once a year once every
two to three years but they just don't
know that I exist so I'm still handing
out a lot of business cards just showing
my face trying to to meet people meet
phys these managers I'll go into fast
food restaurants and say hey is there a
store manager or general manager that
you could put me in touch with and and
at least establish a relationship with
them so that's how I've how I've gotten
90% of my jobs the rest of them have
been through my Google page and people
just Googling parking lot striping and
me popping up and I'm going with me okay
how many jobs have you had give or take
so far so far I've had I think it's 18
or 20 jobs jobs and then what has your
Revenue been so month one Revenue was

[27:04]
Revenue been so month one Revenue was
7,000 and month two was 18,000 what's
month three looking like so far month
three so generally with striping it does
start to slow down a little bit during
the winter months on the books for
November and December each I have 14,000
so 14,000 for November 14,000 for
December okay which we're a weekend in
November which I'm so I'm pretty pretty
happy about that you're feeling good
about it so far I mean it's clearly
going really
well okay back to the the sales aspect
you don't strike me as like an extrovert
you know walk up into into restaurants
and ask to speak to the manager um has
that been unnatural for you or is it
just like that's just what you have to
do you just that that's just what it is
it's not hard it's not easy it's just
part of the process yeah it it is
incredibly unnatural and I can have that

[28:00]
incredibly unnatural and I can have that
thought for about a half second but then
I move on to the second thought of it
has to be done so then I do it yeah you
go full Joo right I'm I'm much better
than than I was two months ago but it
it's not my strong suit you just have to
be honest with people and I I've learned
that that's that's what it takes and
even if you if you lose a job like you
want to build a relationship you know
you want to communicate clearly the
services that you can offer how you can
add value you but you're not trying to
Swindle anyone you know and yeah it's
it's not my emmo to try to upsell people
on things they don't need so yeah if
there has been an interesting
realization I would say
whereas in other jobs in the past if
someone says like no or there's an
objection then like I always honor that
but there's this fine line of like okay
well I actually do have a a service that

[29:00]
well I actually do have a a service that
has
value yeah and I can see with my eyes
you need this yeah and like so it's like
maybe I'm not communicating something
clearly you know maybe I'm and it is my
responsibility to connect the dots for
the potential customer so I think that
I'm definitely getting better at like
okay how can I say succinctly connect
the dots for the customer and
communicate value so early on you're
like all right I no's no he said no and
now it's like you know what like I know
he needs this and most services that
people sell you don't always know that
right like let's say you're selling
cleaning services they might be fine
doing it themselves and they can or they
might be super happy with their current
company but with this it's like I know
for a fact you need it because I'm
looking at it right now and there's zero
chance you own a $10,000 striping
machine you might have a previous
relationship with someone you used five
years ago when you needed it done but
probably not you probably haven't even

[30:00]
probably not you probably haven't even
thought of them for five years so like
there's really it's such a great
business because you just know they need
it and that's like a a framework that
I'm starting to put together of when
deciding what business to start start
one where that's the case like I
interviewed some guys that clean ponds
for a living and they started going door
too and they had amazing success because
they only freaking knocked on doors that
had a pond that was dirty and therefore
thanks to selection bias they knew that
that owner was probably wealthy enough
to afford a $2 to $5,000 Pond cleaning
because they who owns a pond right and
so like they knew they could afford it
they knew they needed it they they knew
it needed to be done and they knew with
reasonable certainty that they weren't
about to do it themselves they might not
even know that their service existed and
so their close rate was probably a
hundred times higher than a door too
Pest Control sales right W one thing
that I've also learned is that
like I don't need to make the sale

[31:00]
like I don't need to make the sale
during that first like contact because
yes we can see faded parking lines but
essentially it's still subjective if
someone's like well I I can see them
enough you know it's like they don't
need it now but it's like okay well
you'll really think that they need it in
a year then you know and so like I was
driving today and I passed by a church
and hadn't knocked on their door yet so
I'm like I'll stop by see see what I can
do for them and they told me that
they're actually doing a complete
parking lot doover and they're going to
Mill it up which I don't do any of the
Milling or asphalt repair sort of stuff
but I'm like well like put me in contact
with the guy who's doing that because
that's another play is getting in
contact with all the asphalt
companies because a lot of them don't
want to do their line striping because
it's usually done at odd hours that

[32:01]
it's usually done at odd hours that
there are companies that just clean
parking lots too for a living like
there's pressure wash companies that
clean parking lots or gas stations and
then there's literally companies that
just go out and pick up trash at like
restaurant or grocery store or
convenience store gas stations like that
could be refer a referral partner for
you too definitely yeah yeah I had
thought about that sure you could give
them 400 bucks for a job and all they
have to do is shoot you a text right you
know it's no- brainer for them yeah all
right so so you've gotten better at
sales because you realize more that
you're you're offering something that
they need and I I think that's such a
critical unlock because a lot of people
myself included is I don't I don't I'm
not good at sales I don't do sales and
it's like really no one likes sales
that's like saying like oh I don't I
don't run marathons because they're hard
it's like yeah they're hard lifting
weights is hard Mar like you're not
special like people that run marath
aren't like oh this is so this feels so

[33:00]
aren't like oh this is so this feels so
good the whole time like it hurts the
whole time it hurts right for two to
four hours straight but like why should
sales be any different yeah it's not fun
even really good sales people are like
this is a job It's a Grind it's kind of
a cat and mouse you can make it more fun
there's no better fertilizer in the
garden than the owner's footsteps like
you are so good at sales because it is
your business and if you're selling the
same thing for a different business
owner you'd probably be half as
effective right
someone that you hire will probably be
half as effective as you yeah yeah and I
going back to like the the initial point
I never would have learned this or tried
to learn this had I not just like Gone
full send if you will you know like this
is one of those things for me where it's
like I've always been sales averse like
let someone else do that and then and
I'm the Ops guy I'm the numbers guy all
all follow through follow through do the
work
but yeah I'm so glad that I I've been

[34:01]
but yeah I'm so glad that I I've been
able to at least do sales and again I'm
I'm no expert at all I I screw up a lot
of opportunities but still grateful for
the opportunities nonetheless did you
read any books or or refer to any
resources to learn
sales I have not you just kind of
winging it the striping company that I
trained with
the the like package that I bought with
them also included some marketing and
sales techniques and videos so that's
been my primary resource of okay where
where do I even start you know with
whether it be cold calling cold emailing
so that's kind of been my main resource
to get me started but now now it's just
been okay but what is starting to work
what's not starting to work and there is
so much of there like there are so many
different different techniques that you
can try and I'm So Young that like I

[35:02]
can try and I'm So Young that like I
haven't even tried like half of them so
how old are you well I'm 28 but just
referring to like so young in the
business like I I tried very many at all
so I need to make sure that I'm not
afraid to at least try some yeah yeah
it's funny not to harp on sales too much
but I served a mission for my church in
Hungary Eastern Europe and that's really
sales like we knocked on doors all day
every day and every time I would knock
on a door I was just secretly wishing
don't answer don't answer don't answer
like 20 like I knocked on like 25,000
doors and I thought that like I was out
there doing it I was hardworking I was
diligent I was efficient but at the same
time it's like the natural man in me
like the weak Chris was just like don't
I don't want to have to sell I don't
want have to sell don't answer like and
I come home my start a business I make
cold calls and it's like don't answer
don't answer and then they answer it's
like hey would you like to buy my X Y or

[36:00]
like hey would you like to buy my X Y or
Z right but it's just like it's just it
you do things because they're not easy
right yeah definitely period okay so you
went out on a limb you burned your boats
you started this business and a lot of
people like the idea of being a business
owner but then they find they don't
actually like being a business owner how
do you like it so far I absolutely love
it I love tracking that dollar from when
it's a thought to when it's in my bank
account and being heavily involved in
every step of the process and sure that
that means that there are stresses that
come along with each of those but I've
really enjoyed it what do you not like
about it and what do you love about it
the most so right now like I'm the only
full-time employee I'll have guys who
will help me out on on larger jobs but
it I'm I'm the one selling I'm the one
creating the
proposal I'm the one like if they accept
the proposal scheduling the work
and then like completing the work like

[37:00]
and then like completing the work like
building a team of guys to complete the
work invoicing collecting payment asking
for the review you know so so doing all
of that and so there there are highs and
lows throughout all of those whether
it's it's challenging to collect payment
or a five- star review comes through you
know so there's there's it's hard for me
to just pick like one thing that I can
say like oh yeah that's that's the most
exciting thing yeah just the whole thing
in aggregate is
exciting what would you say your close
rate is when you go knock a door CT not
necessarily closing on the spot but
event over time what percentage of those
will you close yeah it's hard to kind of
see just because I mean I've knocked so
many doors in the last two months and a
handful of them had said like re like
where our fiscal year ends in December
or not to Marge like reach out to me
then you know this is more of a guess

[38:01]
then you know this is more of a guess
but I'd say it's probably between 5 and
10% so it's not it's not super high I
mean for like it's pretty high like for
any type of sale yeah I feel like that's
pretty high yeah one thing that I will
say is interesting I've never done like
Home Services but I I think that this is
very different than that because
oftentimes like I don't know if I would
say oftentimes but a lot of the times
businesses will have like a a
maintenance line item like a maintenance
budget and this can be pulled from that
and it's it's a less emotional decision
for a lot of people granted if I'm
trying to sell a small business owner
then it can still be an emotional
decision but like it's it's just a
different sale than like cleaning
someone's Windows on their house you
know yeah yeah how much can you lean on
regulation or not like you you knock on
a door like dude your lines are gone
like you could get fine for this like is

[39:01]
like you could get fine for this like is
there anything you can point to to help
close the sale yes yeah so regulations
is definitely something that you can
bring up I've realized that even if I
regulations then like people don't act
unless they get the
notice like there there's gas stations
that I've reached reached out to and
they like agree with with me they're
like yeah they're trash but we're not
going to do anything about it until we
get a noi from the inspector so like
okay and and that's that's kind of like
getting a letter from the HOA right it's
like warning fix this it's like they're
not finded right off the bat it's a
warning exactly yeah so they have time
and I've gotten a handful of jobs that
way is there any Rhyme or Reason To Win
those warnings are sent I'm not sure I
like if you could find like ah there was
you know what I'm saying like you could
tie that to something you could right if
you could go full better call saw and

[40:01]
you could go full better call saw and
make like an official looking letter
with like a red line across the envelope
and it's like notice important and like
you could start a a company called like
official notices Inc that has nothing to
do with the government have you ever
gotten letters like those it's like yeah
there there that's an entire industry
and I I I've been down the rabbit hole
and I hate it so much so I I am joking
right now but there are entire you know
eight figure companies built on tricking
business owners into thinking they need
to pay some fee or fine to what looks
like a government agency that is not so
I that's all all home warranties
are yeah yeah so like if you wanted to
be Shady you could just send like notice
like you're you could even do it where
it's not shady and it's like you you
could send it as yourself and be like
hey it's just direct mail at that point
but it highly targeted Direct Mail hey I
noticed that your lines are pretty faded
right now from what I'm seeing here in
Waco so you're established yourself as
like a local expert which that's exactly
what you are I'm seeing that you know

[41:01]
what you are I'm seeing that you know
eventually you get a letter sooner or
later like it's just a matter of time
it's always good you know you don't want
the city on your wrong side and this is
speaking from experience because I've
had the city of Waco on my bad side
that's another story for another day but
it's like so it's good to get ahead of
it you know you never know when you
might need to call in a favor and then
you could roll up in person and say did
you get my letter you know yeah yeah
there you go kind of soften a little bit
yeah okay so 5 to 10% not bad at all not
as high as I thought honestly but not
bad compared to selling any other
product or service what's next like how
do you scale this is do you want more
locations like what are you
thinking so I think that you one way
that you can scale this is by adding on
Services My Philosophy is I want to get
good at line striping and just get my
name out there and like I feel like I've
touched just such a small all sliver of
the of the pavement marking Market here

[42:01]
the of the pavement marking Market here
so being able to focus on that get to
where I have like two Twan Crews that
are operating if if it's not 40 hours a
week then maybe they're doing it as side
jobs 20 hours a week during their off
hours you know and they're making like
some pretty nice extra income I think
that that's one way you can scale it but
then offering additional Services
getting into crack seal seal coating
like parking lot sweeping street
sweeping that sort of thing roadway
markings does require different
Insurance that's kind of a different
animal more liability there so a lot of
people like I've had buddies they're
like they're restriping that one I'm
like yeah I'm not going to do like
Franklin Avenue you know yeah yeah but
anyways so I think that adding Services
is what a lot of people get into and
some people go the pressure washing
route like and ADD commercial pressure
washing to their Fleet of services and

[43:01]
washing to their Fleet of services and
how often does it need to be done on
average so fast food restaurants like
you're think kind of higher end fast
food like Chick-fil-A Raising Canes they
do it twice a year okay wow holy cow I
would not have guessed that what do most
people do it how often apartment
complexes are every three years pretty
much three to four years and I there's I
know one apartment complex Le apartment
complexes if it has like between 300 and
400 stalls that's going to be between a
eight and 12 or $14,000 job I didn't
realize it was so recurring I would have
thought it was less frequent than
that wow okay and I mean you do have
those like I've knocked on doors and
they're like I think the last time we
did it was when we built the building 15
years ago you know and it's like you can
like kind of see where the lines are
enough for for people to park but the

[44:00]
enough for for people to park but the
second you put new paint on there that's
what everyone's talking about like oh my
gosh like this is a brand new parking
lot does shade play a role like if it's
more shaded that it doesn't fade as fast
yeah so weather definitely plays a role
yeah traffic is plays a far bigger role
but weather also plays a role up north
what what's interesting is they have
snow plows that will scrape up the paint
so if you're thinking about doing this
up north probably even more recurring
yeah so snow plot business in the winter
and line striping in the in the summer
just invent the invent the disease and
sell the Cure right y
y so you said there's one big company in
town doing it other than you is that
right yes well there there's a couple
other companies that do that also do
line striping there's one who's been
here for like 40 years and they they
also do the crack fill the seal coat
they do street sweeping they have like a

[45:00]
they do street sweeping they have like a
lot more equipment that that they can do
they I know they do wheel stop
installations they make their own wheel
stops so and to them I've actually got
to know one of their um guys who does
their estimates pretty well he like
talking to him he's like yeah line
striping like it's a drop in the bucket
like we we chase after the seal coat
jobs and that's that's another selling
point is like I could go to someone and
say Hey you may not have the budget to
do a full parking lot makeover but for
roughly 10% of the cost we can get you a
parking lot that like is like incredibly
updated you know it won't look like
brand new asphalt but people will notice
it your customers will notice it yeah
and like you said with your growth plan
like you could totally start offering
recurring Services right recurring
pressure washing recurring parking lot
cleaning would you rather go that route
next or just get more striping jobs next

[46:00]
next or just get more striping jobs next
I would rather I would rather get more
striping jobs and yeah and become the
like line striping guy in Waco where the
yeah I think there's plenty of work from
I think there's enough work for me to be
running for cruise you know there's a
lot of new construction going on there
like it's a big enough market where
there is the recurring revenue and there
isn't anyone who's solely focused on the
line strike repping so I I don't want to
take away from like that Vision because
I have a random request here or there
from existing customers of like hey
could you also seal coat the barrier to
entry for the crack fill and seal coat I
mean I would say it's probably two to
three times higher just because the
equipment's more expensive and it's more
intense knowhow you could be a
multi-million dollar business just doing
striping in Waco Texas like I'm sure
you've mapped it out and you'd still
probably own a fraction of the market

[47:00]
probably own a fraction of the market
it's every Market is bigger than you
think it is every Niche is bigger than
you think it is if you were to be
counseling someone that's starting this
in you know whatever City USA what would
you counsel them to do differently that
you wish you would have done that's a
good question I think if someone in
their Market is willing to teach them to
or to just like run a line striper for
more than just a couple jobs but like to
run aine instructor for maybe a month or
two you know and that way they can just
see more and not have to learn so much
on the
Fly I think that that those have been
like some of my biggest time sucks is is
learning on the Fly and correcting
mistakes you know yeah it's like yeah
because if you do a mistake on a
customer's property you have to fix it
no matter yeah it cost or how much time
it takes I like that that's just another
framework that I'm thinking of is any
business that gets the majority of their
revenue from cold calling or door

[48:02]
revenue from cold calling or door
knocking like I don't care the market
forget your market research there will
always be a market for that because it's
F first principles it goes against our
human nature to want to do that if you
can reliably acquire customers by
knocking on a door then like I would be
so bold as as to say that and in any
market like of course you should do
market research like it's easy you get
on Google Maps you divide a little bit
but like if you're willing to go out and
do that you could start this anywhere
yes because definitely I mean how many
of your competitors are knocking doors
yeah no none of them exactly exactly and
it's going to be tempting for you to
stop knocking doors like it's human
nature right especially as your Google
leads come in but like that will always
be a a reliable Revenue Source like fa
it's like the the most efficient thing
is usually the least effective thing and
vice versa right it's not efficient for
you to knock doors but is so effective
right it's very efficient to send a
bunch of cold texts less effective right

[49:02]
bunch of cold texts less effective right
right definitely man what a good story
