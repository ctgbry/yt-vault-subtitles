tell me this isn't a brilliant idea so I
went on my first cruise like 15 years
ago and I'm too cheap to buy shore
excursions it cost like 200 bucks to go
snorkeling bise I'm not paying that so I
used to get off the boat and I'd go find
the tour guides that Carnival or Royal
Caribbean is Contracting and say hey how
much 180 bucks nope 30 what no no no 30
bucks I'll pay 30 bucks that's crazy no
okay bye then you do the old walkway and
then they say okay okay okay friend come
on 30 bucks why did they do that because
they already paying for the bus they
already paying for the gas all the
people from Carnival that are right next
to you paid $180 to car Carnival kept
the vast majority of that and paid
pennies to the tour guide so they're
happy to make something because they're
already driving to the snorkeling site
anyway someone needs to build the
Expedia for shore excursions we already
have the Expedia for cruises Expedia for
everything it's already there this is a
way for cruise travelers to skip the
middleman AKA Carnival Royal Caribbean
stop paying those crazy markups and go
directly to the vetted and trusted tour
guides that Royal Caribbean and Carnival
have already vetted they've already done
the hard work for you this is a billion
doll business idea and no one's doing it
there is no trust Ed way to buy shore

excursions directly from the tour guides
