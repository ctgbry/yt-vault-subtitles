it's a good looking
whiteboard trying to set the or chart

goes nice you need a much bigger
whiteboard I mean that organization just

[04:00]
whiteboard I mean that organization just
going to keep growing man hopefully
that's the goal man thanks for having me
on today of course yeah so let me
summarize your question you've got a um
a junk removal business right yes we do
junk removal and residential and
commercial moving now oh okay so junk
removal and moving you're about to hit
seven figures in Revenue you got 150,000
people in your town and you're just kind
of you're in kind of that messy middle
and you're trying to grow right yep
exactly we're in Bend orgon if you know
where that's at kind of a vacation
beautiful beauti changed a lot over the
last 10 years huh yeah especially as a
after covid to it just blew up um so
that's been good starting a business
here but we kind of want to test a
bigger Market um and really see what we
can do okay well let's hear what you're
struggling with do you mind sharing your
business so I can pull up the website
absolutely so the business name is Liv
Li junkless j n k ss.com all right so
let's hear what you're what you're

[05:00]
let's hear what you're what you're
struggling with yeah so we started the
business about three years ago this is
our first real business I got basically
put a $2,500 investment into the company
and since the first job we've been
running off the cash flow um we're up to
about 10 employees now one office staff
and then we have a virtual assistant who
helps organize kind of our backin
metrics all our
financials um and so we've got a
relatively small crew of guys and
we're at this point right now where on
the junk removal side we are kind of the
the market owners in terms of market
share so we probably it's hard to
guesstimate but based off revenue and
the amount of jobs that we're
calculating through just reverse
engineering
Google probably roughly 40 to 50% of
jobs are going through us on the junk
removal side and then moving is growing
so that's probably closer to 10 or
15% um we've got one one franchise here

[06:00]
15% um we've got one one franchise here
in town with college hunks and we pretty
much you know we're playing neck and
neck with them um and so we feel like we
want to grow into Portland it's a
three-hour Drive North from us and
that's about a third of Oregon's
population so we feel like this could be
a good market for us to expand
into the issue is with growth especially
in the cash flow side starting a new
market in a bigger area like Portland
we're trying to project you know how
long is it going to take for us to
become Pro profitable but also take a
little bit of market
share so we're we're kind of going back
and forth between should we grow with
you know invest with just cash flow or
try and take investment and go that
route and so that's kind of where we're
at right now okay have you done any
research yet as as to how much
competition you have in Portland we have
yes um so on the junk removal side we've
got the three big franchises in the junk
removal space and then we've got about
two local players that actually answer

[07:01]
two local players that actually answer
their phone um and don't just sound like
Chuck in the truck so we've got about
five competitors in the entire Portland
metro um which is about an hour drive
let's say you're smack down the middle
well I thought wasn't Portland three
hours away three hours away but if
you're let's say you're smack dab in the
middle of Portland okay okay gotcha an
hour so five potential competitor so
you'd be the sixth we'd be kind of the
sixth yeah big player ideally and Port
Port
like eight 10 times bigger than bend
yeah I think it's about 10 times bigger
now maybe a little bit more and how many
competitors do you have in Bend just one
in junp removal we've got about
seven and then in the movie di side
about
three so you have seven competitors in
Ben but only five in Portland so so we
have seven good competitors in Bend
actually like I would say they they
answer their phone they're out every day

[08:00]
answer their phone they're out every day
actually working majority in Portland
it's a lot of Onan trucks with a dump
trailer and it's you know we called
about we scraped about 50 companies
called them all and about five actually
sounded like they run a real
business okay so do you sorry they're
they're going off the same compe the
same customers we are the ones that
actually will spend for brand versus
just like that one the cheapest guy
basically that helps okay and so five
competitors in Port that are legit that
would be direct competitors you're not
even counting Chuck in a truck as a
competitor no because a lot of their
customers are going to be the people
that just want to pay the lowest amount
yeah and that's not what we're trying to
go for and so in Bend you have five
legitimate competitors or or seven
legitimate competitors seven were like
you know we've called them we know most
of them and they actually do a pretty
good job I would say there's two that
are just about you know they're
organized they have good pricing set up
and they know how to run a business

[09:00]
and they know how to run a business
okay I mean so on paper like there's
significantly less competition per
capita in Portland than bend right like
significantly less absolutely there's
more so from a markeing perspective PPC
is how we gain initial traction and
there's a lot of competitors playing you
know on the PPC side so there would be a
lot of money that would have to go into
you know developing the marketing there
but in terms of the actual competition
I'm pretty sure we could up there with
Junk King and got junk and and blow them
out of the water just because we're
small and we can act Nimble and you know
we're not a franchise yeah have you
looked at starting in Eugene just as
like a because that first second Market
is a big deal right like to go from two
to three no big deal one to two is a big
deal have you thought about kind of
dipping your toe in the water in Eugene
especially since it's closer and smaller
yeah we have we actually um we've
definitely considered that the
population's a little bit smaller and we
don't know the demographic as well and

[10:01]
don't know the demographic as well and
so that was kind of our you know our our
hesitation there it's a college town
Romy yeah uo is there and it's
definitely a college
town do you know what the competition
looks like there yeah there's two
there's two franchises there's junk
luggers and I think there's junk King in
Eugene as well I believe um and then
there's just some local guys but you
know they don't we're mainly worried
about the the franchise because they
actually know how to Market and brand
that's really the the big thing in
jumping yeah I mean it looks like it's
not even that much closer than Portland
right half hour half hour okay same with
Salem Salem's yep it's about a half hour
closer okay so when it comes to junk
removal and moving what do you like more
what what side of the business are you
wanting to lean
into when we first start in Portland I
really do think that junk removal

[11:01]
really do think that junk removal
overall is more profitable from the
beginning but moving has more demand and
so it really I'm kind of torn 5050 and
looking at the data moving has about
double the search volume as as junk rle
does and
so for us operationally we would send
down one of our team leads that's
currently here and set him up as an
operations manager down there and we
would handle the marketing but he has
experience in both moving and jump
removal and so we could honestly play it
both ways it's just I actually would
love your opinion do you think that's
too much to try and do both or would you
focus on one to start if I were
expanding into a new market I would
definitely start with one um because
that's what you did here not really by
Design you started a junk removal
company right so that's more familiar
you're using the same truck for both
Services right so we utilize for
Portland let's say we started both there
we would buy a down truck and and we
probably rent a box truck from Pinsky to

[12:02]
probably rent a box truck from Pinsky to
get yeah okay so pretty low cost to
start because you you are able to
rent exactly most of our cost is
honestly marketing and then the
operation man your salary okay how often
are the two Services paired
together about 50% of the time
okay okay and that's just like without
you having to to push it it's just like
if someone needs junk removed 50% chance
they're going to need moving as well
with like six months to a year is what
we're finding because a lot of junk will
come it usually it's the reverse if
someone's moving a lot of times they
need junk removal right away if someone
needs junk removal we'll pitch to the
fact that they we do moving and then six
months down the road they usually call
us to do the move so you're remarketing
to these guys are you keeping them in an
email list and all that yes we utilize
jobber and then we have they just
Unleashed their whole new marketing
campaign so we've been sending out L we
I think we have 3,000 people that are on
that okay yeah so in your opinion it

[13:01]
that okay yeah so in your opinion it
makes sense to keep doing both like it's
not it's not too difficult to do moving
as well like you want to keep leaning
into that or you're on the fence they're
so similar and that's why it was a
natural progression that's why College
Hunks really did that is because they're
they go hand inand labor wise it's just
some of the systems in planning are a
little bit different that's it how is
your pricing compared to college hunks
or Junk King on the junk side we're
about
$30 cheaper on a full load basis so if
you fill up a full truck um but 30 out
of how much is a full load so every
franchise usually from what I've seen is
between $750 and $800 depending on the
market for a full fit yard truck so you
were within 5% cost of the big guys
exactly okay and we really take the
approach like we kind want to be the
Chick-fil-A or Less Schwab of these
industries so we try and be clean cut
polos good or
service um and then our pricing is super

[14:03]
service um and then our pricing is super
comparable so it's like are you going to
choose the local guy or you going to
choose the franchise which that's why we
kind of had success in that um moving
though is really just a customer service
game because it's very regulated your
prices are decided for you and so
everyone's the same um so it's just how
are your prices I don't understand that
what do you mean so in Oregon and in a
lot of States if you're doing an inate
so like a local move less than 50 miles
we have to follow a a tariff that
defines our prices for us um if you do
long distance it's based on weight and
distance and so it's just everyone is
very similar similarly
priced and I had no idea super regulated
I know I knew Oregon was very regulated
but I didn't know that was a thing um
how common is that in other states super
common because what was happening is
back in the 90s and early 2000s movers
were holding cargo hostage until they up

[15:02]
were holding cargo hostage until they up
and so they forced a very regulated
system so now you know every state has
some type of Department of
Transportation that you have to be
aligned with and then obviously the US
do to do anything across state lines
that is fascinating I don't I I had no
idea I'm I'm so cheap like I don't pay
movers i'
like I'm so cheap and I'm so lazy that I
don't move so I don't have to move my
stuff if I did move I would have I would
move my own stuff so I hear you man so
right now gun of the head what are you
going to do to grow go to Portland do
both at the same time or start with one
and that really we're we're kind of torn
we have the experience in in the systems
right now to where we could what we're
really trying to do is build a training
system to improve our our leadership in
the current staff we have and use them
as kind of a you know a Chick-fil-A
method of hey we'll give you partial
ownership in this business
pay for performance you got to train the

[16:01]
pay for performance you got to train the
guys under you so I'm pretty confident
we can do that successfully that's
easier said than done that next person
can go to the next Market introduce both
services and we could run both okay
simultaneously do you have a specific
person in mind for Portland yet we do
and he's his name is Ryan he's been on
our crew for about a year and a half um
and he has about three years moving
experience prior to that as well so he's
pretty versed in the industry who would
step in for him in Bend if he were to
move to Portland uh we've got a guy
named Bryce on the team and he is he's
shown you know initiative and he
understands the systems and how he work
and so he would kind of replace Ryan
okay yeah do you think Bryce might be
the second guy to go to Portland I think
he you know if if that model worked I
think he would actually want to take it
to a different
location so that's seems so big it's
super big and so that's we don't want to
overextend ourselves with the cash flow
we do have which is kind of why we're in

[17:01]
we do have which is kind of why we're in
this weird Middle Ground where it's like
you know we've kind of maxed out what we
can do and bend yeah and so it's the
only other option unless we just want to
stay
content who wants to do that exactly
it's too boring we got to progress
that's why we're on this Earth y um have
you already talked about territories uh
what was the first guy's name Ryan Ryan
have you ever already talked about like
a territory of Portland with Ryan
yeah so we've already had this
conversation and he's very interested um
we would focus really what what we want
to do is is narrow down Portland into
one small circle to start in and that
would be the west side of Portland so
kind of we're Nikes based so be and kind
of the the higher end
suburbs that's where we start have you
done more granular PPC research or
competitive research based on
territories within Portland we have so
we've done keyword research and kind of
what the average price is and it's super
comparable to bend um so it's it's

[18:00]
comparable to bend um so it's it's
ranging between $15 to $100 for an
actual
conversion okay expensive it's
competitive yeah and if you were to use
Ryan for this would you start with one
service or
both to be honest my gut tells me to do
both because I know I can create instant
demand off on moving um yeah but I know
it makes it more complex junk is gonna
probably take longer because people vet
junk companies more actually they
actually like look into them versus MS
just need their stuff moved and they
don't care as much
yeah which I thought it' be reverse
right but it it's not so it's just this
[Music]
weird area I'm in right now yeah I think
you're really smart with thinking about
the concept of momentum because that
that second location can make or break
you and even if it's more simple to to
launch with Just Junk Removal the lack
of momentum could be a net negative for
you all equal because you've already

[19:00]
you all equal because you've already
cracked the complexity code on offering
two Services right now the complexity
you need to crack is going three hours
away to a not just a bigger Market but a
different market like a different
culture Al together right like someone
living in near the Nike headquarters I
would imagine is completely different
than someone living in Bend Oregon right
Bend is like it's on an island it's very
unique um is there a part of Portland
that is more like Bend than West
Portland actually West Portland's
probably the most comparable because
what happens is people visit Ben for
corporate Retreats so through Intel or
Nike or tectronics and they end up
saying hey I love this place as soon as
I retire have the option to I'll move to
bend and so the last five years the
demographic from Bend has kind of gone
from dirt back skier to more like hey
I've got a lot of money and Ben is a
vacation Market let's move there yeah um
and so what we like about Portland is
it's more white collar and folks don't
have trucks they don't have access to
dump trailers or moving equipment they
don't want to do it themselves and the

[20:01]
don't want to do it themselves and the
demographic between Ben and Portland
like you can look at the moving data
everyone from Portland where Seattle or
San Francisco is moving to B and so it's
super similar in terms of the
person
um I don't know if that helps yeah it
does and how long have you been open in
Bend and and how long has Ryan been with
you so we're coming up on three years in
July um so we started 2021 and then
Ryan's been with us for a year and a
half now so about half the time okay man
it might make for really good content
for me to just like turn your model on
on its head and just send you a
different direction but I think you're
just like I just want to confirm the
path that you're already on if if I were
you I would like you're you been in
business for three years I would do
exactly what you're planning on doing I
would go to West Portland I would use
Ryan I would make sure that he knows
what his territory is I wouldn't promise

[21:04]
convert to prata equity maybe the same
maybe different maybe it's 10% rev share
that converts to 5% Equity or 10% Equity
or whatever in that territory I would be
very cautious on everything you promise
him today because a lot can change and
you're much more likely for him to feel
bummed that things didn't go as you
thought it might go then you are for him
to just suddenly become a bad employee
right like I feel like he's already
proven himself
but at like offering Equity to employees
can be logistically tricky um and I've
made that mistake in the past of of
offering ownership and then when push
came to shove it was actually kind of
hard to make that work due to external
circumstances um but I think I think it
would be a net negative if you launched
in a new market with just one service I
feel like you need that momentum you
want to get Revenue in the bank it just
feels good to get that first job like
the dopamine hit of your first revenue
is better than the dopamine hit of like

[22:01]
is better than the dopamine hit of like
your first $100,000 month um so I I
would just continue on the path that
you're on and and go to Portland and you
could be a $10 million company after um
saturating Portland right it's awesome
no I appreciate the time and I agree and
you know the other thing on the the
compensation is we might just put him on
a salary and make it Performance Based
and create a hey if you climb our
Revenue ladder this is where you'll end
up and these you Ben you'll get versus
the ownership model which is I think
probably a better bet but they're still
upside you know
so great yeah thank you Chris I
appreciate the time absolutely also I
meant to say that your uh your website
looks awesome I mean it seems like
you're doing everything right so just
keep crushing it trying appreciate it
keep doing what you're doing it's

Patrick and there he

what's up hey those are good-looking
teeth you must have a good
dentist oh man thank you thank you
thanks for taking the time to hop on the
phone today of course yeah I'm really
excited about this one I love unique
sexy businesses and this seems like it's
one of them so let's let's hear what you
like where are you in this process
and yes sorry for the issues with my
connection there I am unfortunately
driving right now um I'm parked while
we're recording but uh that might be the
issue on the connection so it heard your
podcast asking for questions ideas if
you had any and I thought this might be
the type of business that you'd be
interested in uh last summer was exposed
to to Flow Rider for the first time it's

[27:00]
to to Flow Rider for the first time it's
you might have been on a cruise and seen
one of these but best way I could
describe it for the listeners is a surf
simulator it's a ton of fun for kids
through adults and got back and thought
man I would love to take my kids to
something like this we live in Texas 100
degrees in the summer even swiming
outside is hot and so started thinking
what could it look like to create an
indoor low rider venue where you give
people the opportunity to come and ride
one of these machines you have some uh
food beverage options birthday parties
those kind of what I started thinking
about and um am interested in starting a
business that will serve my community
and help families make memories have a
good time and so I have done some
research talking to a manufacturer of
this machine and got some pricing on

[28:00]
this machine and got some pricing on
that and now I'm trying to figure out is
this even a good idea is it crazy is
this something that people would show up
to in a way that uh would allow me to uh
have a sustainable business do you need
to have some sort of additional offering
besides just the the Flow Rider to go
with it the model I was looking at as a
two-lane Flow Rider so could probably
have about 20 people 10 each side going
for hour sessions at a time um and so
sorry that that was a lot happy to
answer any question questions feel like
I was all over the place there but um
I'd say early stages of this uh if I
could be convinced of the the numbers
I'd be ready to to move forward quickly
and just kind of hard to do validation
on an idea like this when uh you don't
really have many competitors um to to
see if this is something people are
interested in
yeah so where in Texas are you in

[29:02]
yeah so where in Texas are you in
College Station Texas so home at Texas
A&M got like 70,000 college students and
it's growing quite a bit I mean there's
a lot of young families uh it's right uh
connected to Brian as well so uh good
population base not a major city but
certainly think there'd be enough
population to support something like
this yeah now does it have to be indoors
or could it be outdoors as well it could
be outdoors the only reason I was
thinking indoors could make sense is in
the summertime even sitting outside uh
you know if I'm a dad going to take my
wife and I have four kids something like
this if it's 100 degrees and 2 o'clock
in the afternoon um you know even if
there's shade at the the venue it would
I think be not the most enjoyable
experience if you weren't on the Flow
Rider machine then as well if it was
indoor something I think you could do
year round and have people even when the
the weather's not great um still use the
the machine but could certainly be done

[30:01]
the machine but could certainly be done
outside does it have to be like built
into the structure or is it kind of more
like a like a bounce house and you can
place it somewhere well so as I started
researching it uh they've got an option
that is like a mobile version that is
the same material as an inflatable
bounce house um it's got the similar
powerful Jets to where it looks like the
experience would be pretty similar you
wouldn't have the ability to do the the
two l main option on that so you'd have
fewer customers uh that could go at one
time but um and I haven't been on one of
those personally but from what I
understand it's a pretty similar setup
to the ones that are installed um you
know in the ground okay so it's feasible
to think that you could rent a space not
have to build like a custombuilt space
rent a space put one of these in there
and have the business that
way yes yeah um so I mean if it was hey

[31:00]
way yes yeah um so I mean if it was hey
I could you know rent a space there's a
big mall parking lot right off the the
highway that is is empty could you you
know rent that and put a mobile
concession stand Snack Shack and put
some shade up and you run this during
the summer I certainly think that um
would be feasible um could be a
possibility and I just was unsure of um
you know what sort of traction and a
place place that gets to 1002 1003
during the day you might get at 3 in the
afternoon yeah now how does it work with
the manufacturer do they sell it to you
do you lease it is it a franchise how
does that work how it cost so yeah so I
um initially had reached out to to Flow
Rider directly and uh those are super
expensive um to the point where I was
like ah that doesn't really make sense
but have sourced some things from China
in the past since started reaching out
to some suppliers uh in China and could

[32:02]
to some suppliers uh in China and could
get one of them one of the inflatable
ones for about
$150,000 so um it was more reasonable
than I had expected um and I'd have to
have my lawyer check to make sure
there's not some sort of issue patent
wise with with Flow Rider um you know
the supplier said no it's no issue but
uh have not done any of that legal due
diligence yet and what does it cost if
you were to buy this one for 150 Grand
how much how much can you make like per
hour maximum if it if there was a line
yeah that yeah that that's a a good
question I'm a big fan of not doing
public math but um the what what I've
seen is people will try and sell
something like this for an hour so say
maybe sell a hourlong slot and you might
have 10 to 15 kids that you allow to
that way the line's not too long you're
waiting 45 minutes before you can go
cycle through the line quickly yeah I
think that you could charge 20 25 bucks

[33:02]
think that you could charge 20 25 bucks
um per hour slot so I think it'd be and
a you know if you had 10 15 kids pretty
reasonable to think you can make 250 300
bucks an hour uh in terms of Revenue
just from those ride tickets and you if
you did that 10 hours a day in the
summer you know could you do 200 to
3,000 bucks in a day I certainly think
if the weather was nice um and you were
able to get the word out it's it's
something that you I've got four kids
I'd take my kids up to to do something
like this yeah so if it were if it had
two lanes and it was 20 bucks then like
each kid what does it take five minutes
per per ride oh no it's much shorter
than that I mean most people are wiping
out pretty quickly um so but they get a
few they get a few tries don't they yeah
so you'd be able to go through uh they
estimate that you can go through a
couple hundred rides an hour you know so
if you had uh 10 people and you know you

[34:01]
if you had uh 10 people and you know you
were able to have 200 rides over that
hour you know each kid going 20 times um
you know something like that and
obviously someone who's more advanced
might last longer but when I saw it on
the uh the cruise most people were not
going longer than yeah a few seconds I
mean they were they were wiping out yeah
I went on a cruise on one of those and I
was not good and it was embarrassing
okay yeah especially whenever you then
have the kids who are making it look
easy and it's like yeah my pride and ego
hurts there a little bit um yeah so if
you've got two lanes let's just be
conservative let's say you can put 15
people on it per hour two lanes so 30
kids per hour for a two-lane machine 20
bucks per ride that's what 600 600 bucks
an hour is that
reasonable I think it'd be reasonable to
I mean I think that math checks out
would you always be 100%
utilization probably not um and I think

[35:02]
utilization probably not um and I think
it it would vary you know on the
weekends
summertime um I think it could be
reasonable to hit those sorts of numbers
um but again that's where I struggle in
terms of projecting this out it's not
like there's uh someone doing this down
the road that I can go and and just see
hey how many customers are are they they
getting um you but even if it was 50%
utilization could you get 300 bucks an
hour um you know I certainly think 50%
uh in the summertime would be be
reasonable um have you ever looked for
one of these for sale like on Facebook
Marketplace or Ebay a used one
specifically uh so when I talked to Flow
Rider they had some used ones for sale
but they were still going to be several
hundred thousand dollars so I think
getting something from China would be
cheaper assuming that the quality
is what the videos show and I mean
there's Resorts throughout Asia who have

[36:02]
there's Resorts throughout Asia who have
these similar types of machines that
were not manufactured by Flow Rider but
uh from some of the suppliers there in
China um yeah and so I mean maybe is
there a scenario where if it failed
could just go and and sell it um and
make my money back or uh minimize the
loss I um you know I think it's probably
a niche buyer but
uh I but I've not checked maret for all
right I've got a bunch of ideas so I
just actually this morning I interviewed
the owner of dig World which is like a a
kids amusement park for heavy heavy
machinery that that isn't going to go
live for a couple weeks but it was super
interesting because he placed dig world
right outside of like one of the most
popular shopping malls in Houston and so
he had he had baked in demand and it's
basically it's a 3 acre lot grassy lot
right next to the parking lot and so
it's just really EAS he doesn't own the
land he just leases it and so if I were

[37:00]
land he just leases it and so if I were
you I I love this idea I would get find
as many Chinese manufacturers or
suppliers of this as possible and maybe
there's only five and I would ask all of
talk to three to five of their previous
customers um and they might be someone
in like Saudi Arabia they they might not
be American but try to get them on the
phone and say like all right what do I
need to know what and pay them for their
time what are the expectations here
what's a good day what what's a bad day
what do you charge how many people can
you get through per hour what type of
location do you have these things at and
try to get an idea of how much money
he's actually making um from that exact
machine that you would be buying as well
um and then I would even see if you can
put these outside of a mall or inside of
a mall um I think water is the hardest
part but did you see my tweet about the
um like the inflatable bull riding
business yeah a few ago yeah that was
that was awesome I look at this very
similarly um and you know all the

[38:01]
similarly um and you know all the
commenters like what about insurance
what about like you just buy it like
people insure bull riding places that's
why there are bull riding places um I
look at this very similarly a lot more
expensive um but potentially higher
upside because if you can make let's say
full capacity 10hour day you you might
never have a day like this six grand
then let's be conservative and say that
an average day is two grand um means you
pay off the thing not including labor
cost you pay off the thing in 75 days um
and maybe you're only open on the
weekends well that's less than a year in
include the labor cost maybe it's two
years it's pretty good Roi um you could
even start calling up malls today and
say hey would you ever allow something
like this either outside or inside and
law of large numbers says that someone
would and maybe it's a crappy mall maybe
they're desperate maybe it's worth
testing it in a crappy Mall um maybe you
go find the crappy mall and you walk
around and just start talking to the

[39:00]
around and just start talking to the
business owners and you find all right
these guys are not doing well but this
type of business maybe an arcade is
actually still really really still doing
well um so I would start doing the
research just by getting on the phone
with previous buyers of these machines
and um like leasing offices at malls and
see if they would allow something like
it um I think you're you're on to
something with the indoor aspect but the
outdoor aspect is also interesting
because you could if these are portable
you could just start testing these at
fairs and farmers markets just to like
learn and like all right I'm never going
to pay the bills by doing uh farmers
markets or fairs on the weekend but I'm
going to learn a lot about pricing and
consumer behavior and you know if you
pay $10 do you get five tries or three
like that's going to be my testing
ground for this um and then use that
research to make a decision but I bet
you that there's a market for buying
something like this but you know like
anything when you're when you're buying
something for China that's that
expensive fire beware because those

[40:00]
expensive fire beware because those
things could leak you never know there
of course risk yeah yeah no I appreciate
the the feedback and I've talked to it
seems like most of the customers are in
Asia um and I've talked to one of them
uh and that's seems like most of these
are placed at large Resorts water parks
um and there are some here in the states
um but they're you know part of Kalahari
indoor water park this massive water
park here in Texas and so
um I I appreciate your suggestions and
uh plan to make some calls and see what
I can find out and um I am getting close
to just saying worst case scenario if
there's a way to test it in the the
parking lot of a mall or do this in a um
lowrisk way uh be interested to see if
it could lead to anything so I I'll keep
you posted but really appreciate your
time and suggestions
today oh sorry I lost you for a second
but I I got the just it yeah I I think
it's worth testing for sure um and I

[41:01]
it's worth testing for sure um and I
want to I want to hear how it goes even
if you don't end up launching I want to
hear what you learn from this research
awesome well I'll keep you posted man
thank you so much for all that you do I
really appreciate it of course yeah
thanks for coming on yeah have a great
weekend you twoo see you
bye Nat Nat if you can hear me you are
after
Luke all right that was
fun I hope he ends up launch launching
that
hey hey how's it going good how are you

[42:00]
hey hey how's it going good how are you
man I'm pretty good pretty good thanks
for having welcome to the the Kent
office of course yeah um so I I want to
hear about your tutoring business and
what you're struggling with yeah so I
started back in November um it started
off pretty slowly I was trying to do
Facebook ads but I really like had no
clue what I was doing I had never tried
Facebook ads before and I was trying to
ring it but obviously that didn't work
out um so then I moved into uh actually
going into Facebook group so like Mom
and Dad groups um school districts and I
was just sort of saying hey um I'm a
college kid and I'm I'm looking to tutor
uh online and if anyone's interested so
like that sort of message and um it
worked yeah you are doing this virtually
so GE geography is not a concern right
yeah no not a concern yeah
you broke up for a sec yeah yeah yeah
I'm here yeah so you're doing all this

[43:02]
I'm here yeah so you're doing all this
yourself or you have employees I'm doing
all myself right now yeah okay all right
so you started joining Facebook groups
and how did that go um it went okay I
was able to get a lot of responses and
people saying uh yeah I need tutoring um
and and you know they were responding
and I get a lot of direct messages um
people that were interested in it um but
the conversions on that were really low
um but one thing I did notice is that
when I was able to get people on an
introduction call um I was always able
to get like at least one session with
them and so that well but yeah so your
your your close rate is high from your
sales calls basically yeah yeah exactly
do you have any idea of the exact
percentage close rate or an approxim um
in terms of like the amount that I got
on the intro
calls yeah like how many people did you
convert based on how many intro calls
you had um so I probably
had maybe eight intro calls and I think

[44:02]
had maybe eight intro calls and I think
seven out of the eight I was able to
like at least do some you know some
people I was able to get as consistent
customers for like you know like months
at a time but others it was like one and
then you know they they didn't schedule
another one after that but yeah so of of
the seven how many would you say were
ended up being recurring versus the one
off uh about four of them I was able to
I tutor them for probably about two
months um because I started back in
November so like obviously the school
year ended and you know I'm not really
doing it right now but I'm trying to
prepare for the next year and then how
much are you charging and then how often
are your lessons so like H how much
revenue does a two-month long customer
represent to you um so a two-month
customer so I would do about one to two
sessions a week um and they would be 30
minute sessions and I would charge
$24.99 for those half hour sessions and
so that would I would probably make
roughly 100 25 150 um every month and so

[45:10]
yeah for a couple
months right oh here we go can you hear
me yeah yeah so 25 by or half hour yeah
um and the average customer stays and
you do that twice a week the average
customer stays a couple months right
yeah yeah exactly okay have you ever
experimented with your pricing at all um
no I I pretty much had the same same
pricing structure throughout the whole
time and I was also one thing that I
also want to change going into next year
I was hoping to get some advice on this
I was charging the same price um like
regardless of the the group that I was
tutoring so like high school middle
school I was charging the same price and
I looking back on that probably wasn't
that good of an idea but yeah yeah
when you go in are you able to acquire

[46:00]
when you go in are you able to acquire
customers outside of these Facebook
groups or has that been your only way um
so I did get one through well I got two
through like word of mouth and like
recommendations from someone who I was
already tutoring um and I I got like one
more from like a recommendation from um
like my mom's friend something like that
sort of deal okay but mostly Facebook
groups yeah yeah
recall yeah sorry I keep my connection
must be bad or something that's okay
what is your pitch in the Facebook
groups what do you say to them so I
haven't pull up here actually um so it
says hello parents I'm a first year
student at wasu and I'm a virtual tutor
if your child could use some help in
algebra geometry or any K through 12
math concepts feel free to send me a
message I have availability every day of

[47:01]
message I have availability every day of
the week and I'd love to help so that
was the message I would send out to the
groups and yeah that same message every
time have you played around with it at
all well I would I would um say like
hello parents of you know insert
town but that was pretty much the most I
would do with that and so are you in
Seattle then no I'm in um I'm in St
Louis oh okay and it's Washington
University yeah Washington University in
St Louis yeah okay not University of
Washington yeah not not University
washon okay yeah and are you posting in
Facebook groups that are geographically
nearby or no uh I did yeah I I did post
in a lot that were were nearby I sort of
started in in this area and then I kind
of just went everywhere you can probably
look up a random School District
Facebook group you probably see my post
in there but yeah yeah okay now what was
the call to action at the end again were
you asking them to DM you yeah I said um
feel free to send me a message I have

[48:00]
feel free to send me a message I have
availability every day of the week and
I'd love to help okay and do people ever
comment yeah yeah I get a lot of
comments from people just asking
questions like how much does it cost um
you know like is it online well some
people would ask that even though it's
said online but um okay just people
inquiring about like what subjects I was
doing and and that sort so the the first
thing I would do I think you're doing a
lot of stuff right I I like that you're
even though you're virtual you're
posting nearby because they have that
Affinity to you um I like that you're
saying you're a college student because
people want to support that I think the
fact that you're closing 90% of your
calls means that you you could be
charging a lot more and you might be
able to make twice as much for doing the
same amount of work right I imagine
these calls don't take that long they
probably like 10 minutes yeah yeah they
just want to make sure you're a real
person that you sound and seem nice
right um I would have your call to
action be more incentivizing for them to
comment because Facebook loves comments

[49:01]
comment because Facebook loves comments
now I know people are commenting but if
you just call the action them to comment
instead of DM you um it will it will
tell face the Facebook group groups
algorithm that whatever you're saying is
more interesting than average and it
will it will because you know like I own
Facebook groups and I'll post something
really interesting and Facebook will
only show it to 5% of the group members
right but as people start commenting
they will naturally start showing it to
more and oh okay gotcha I I didn't know
that's how that worked yeah yeah they'll
say oh this is interesting more people
might want to see this got try try to
incentivize comments definitely raise
your prices um I would basically also
put some sort of sense of urgency in
there where it's like hey like I just
had a cancellation I've got a couple
slots I still need to fill right they
they usually go pretty fast as oppos to
saying like I've got all the time in the
world it's like right H how good is he
if he has all the time in the world you
know yeah yeah that makes sense
definitely like I have two slots left

[50:00]
definitely like I have two slots left
and it's like oh oh I gotta I gotta do
something you know right yeah or I would
also take um I think what what subjects
are you tutoring for specifically so I
do it's mainly math so I'll do like
algebra geometry um make pre-calculus
that's what to do okay so a couple more
ideas are you listed on any marketplaces
because I know there are some Market
places that match tutors with parents
are you on any of them yeah I was on one
called tutors.com where you can okay you
can pretty much pay for leads and you
know like you'll pay you'll pay like a
$20 flat fee or whatever and then
they'll have someone message you that's
looking for a tutor that's cool okay so
I would definitely recommend look look
for other Niche tutoring marketplaces do
you have an upwork account no I don't I
would definitely make an upwork account
because you can you know you'll pay
upwork five to acquire a customer but
then you can pull them off upwork so you
don't have to pay any fees and have them
recurring customer that's how I found my
son a tutor I I just thought to go to
upwork yeah um most people don't do that

[51:01]
upwork yeah um most people don't do that
but I think there is a self- selection
in there where people that are like
posting to upwork are like more white
collar maybe more able to pay you more
per hour right right yeah um I would
also go to all those marketplaces all
those platforms for tutors and try to
reverse engineer them by seeing like you
click the drop down like subjects what
do they have listed first because I
guarantee you whatever the other listing
first is the most popular right I feel
like algebra is one of the most
sought-after
subjects and then in your Facebook post
you can take that data and lead with
that the subjects that are the most
maybe not math but more granular like
geometry algebra or whatever it is
algebra one Algebra 2 right or go into
other Facebook groups for parents and
start searching for words like algebra
math geometry and like find Facebook
groups for parents that aren't local but
have like hundreds of thousands of
people just because you're going to use
those to try to get data and just search

[52:00]
those to try to get data and just search
for specific terms language arts Math
Science and see which ones are appearing
the most often same with next next door
same strategy on on next door what are
parents asking for the most and then in
the comments of those posts what are
people complaining about and what are
their pain points what are their biggest
pain points and then lead with those in
your local Facebook groups that might
only have 5,000 people in them right
okay okay gotcha yeah yeah that makes a
sense yeah yeah I think you're on the
right track with Facebook groups like
because there are unlimited amounts of
those and it doesn't you could do it all
over the world right um so once you hone
in that process and know all right if
I'm in a red state I'm gonna post about
this if I'm in a blue state I'm gonna
like you're going to
[Music]
learn did you lose me
yeah yeah for a second there I said
you're gonna you're going to be so busy

[53:00]
you're gonna you're going to be so busy
that you're going to be hiring people to
help fill all that demand because you're
going to learn all these little tactics
so okay so you recommend I like I wait
till I I sort of fill up a lot of
sessions and then start start delegating
the the tutoring to other people uh yes
okay yeah you want you want to be like
drowning in work before you really start
hiring other people because then that's
when you're going to be forced to learn
all these scaling mechanisms right okay
that makes a lot of sense
yeah man well I'm excited I want to hear
how it goes yeah absolutely thank you so
much for the advice it was very helpful
no problem Luke good luck thank you
going all
right all right Natt I'm letting that in
Brigham you are
[Music]
next Brigham is next Natt how are
you I'm good and you I'm good so your
question is around um finding products
with high demand so why don't you tell
me exactly what you're looking

[54:02]
me exactly what you're looking
for yeah
so I'm used to finding demand for apps
right mobile apps but I I don't know how
the physical Goods work so for example
when I when I want to find demand for a
mobile app I want to go to search ads or
sensor Tower to find that okay the ad
has a good search volume but for
physical Goods I don't know right do you
go to Google Keyword
to find that this product is actually
good or do you go to Facebook search ads
to find the demand because otherwise
it's a waste of my time to focus on a
certain product that I know that will
not have demand yeah that that was it
it's I'm naive about the physical
Goods but you do have experience with
the apps you're
saying yeah for for intangible goods or
mobile apps yes now are you are you just
trying to resell existing products that
that might like be hot or TR right now
no not really I'm more like a Creator

[55:00]
no not really I'm more like a Creator
like I like to create my own product but
then it's starting from uh something
existing right so improve on something
that already exists
MH okay so you want to find a popular
product people are already buying might
have a deficiency of some sort and then
you want to kind of put your touch on it
and make it better and then sell that
yeah exactly okay have you looked at um
Jungle Scout yet no so try that that's
specifically for Amazon I think they're
they're launching to other platforms or
they already have but that will show you
exactly what is hot on Amazon um and
exactly what's trending how many units
and it's not perfectly accurate but it's
directionally accurate how many units
they're selling per month or how many
dollars they make you per month and then
you can also go to Alibaba and Al
Express and teu and look at what they're
pushing the most like start searching

[56:01]
pushing the most like start searching
different categories and start paying
attention to how they're ranking your
search results yeah because that's
probably what's popular right now um
furthermore there is a I don't remember
this so you're gonna have to Google it
but there's a a URL suffix that you can
add to any Shopify store that will show
you all of their products by best to
worst selling okay okay I've done this
before so basically use builtwith
docomo ify stores and then you're going
to take a spreadsheet put all of their
URLs and then use the concate Nate
function um to attach the same URL
suffix to all of these different Shopify
store URLs and then you'll be able to
see you can do this manually or hire a
VA to do this exactly which of their
products sell the most in that current
moment okay I'm I'm also interested in
the competition right because in in

[57:00]
the competition right because in in
mobile apps you can see the the uh the
popularity like people searching for
this product and you can also see the
competition right so by definition when
I see high high volume of search but
High competition then it's more it's a
red ocean right it's more difficult to
compete you have to compete with price
or with ads which is I don't like those
those games so I was thinking if there's
something similar that I can find high
volume search below
competition like maybe Shopify for the
high volume they have a lot of stores
that are pursuing the same customers
right is that a way to do that I believe
so I I know there are tools out there
that do that nothing is coming to mind
offhand but there's a tool uh called I
think Gummy Search which does that for
Reddit it will show you what topics are
talked about the most in any given
subreddit and like what comments have
certain um
like appearances a certain number of
appearances for specific products or

[58:00]
appearances for specific products or
comments in within subreddits okay so
Gummy Search works great but as far as
finding out how much competition there
is I know that jungle Scout does that on
Amazon you can see how many it will show
you right there in the Chrome extension
how many sellers sell that exact product
um and then I think you can even add
products to like your watch list to
watch over time to see if they're
they're going up or down in popularity
or competition
M yeah this this gumy search looks
interesting to me yeah it's pretty
cool but then hopefully you don't mind
me asking this but you know that Reddit
is difficult to to self promote right so
how do you use this gumy search you you
find where the demand is and then but
then is is there a way to self promote
on Reddit found oh yeah so I wrote a
newsletter on this like four or five
months ago so if you go to newsletter.
Christ jer.com there's one specifically
about how to go viral on Reddit there is

[59:00]
about how to go viral on Reddit there is
a way to do it um it's it's very
replicable you just have to kind of tell
your story and show people what you're
building in a very informative way um
with a good hook and a good title and
then once it starts taking off then you
can edit the post to add a link directly
to your product or service but if you if
you put the link in there in the
beginning then it will never take off
because it's too obviously promotional
do you put the link in the first the
first time that you write the post or at
the end you edit the post after you no
Links at all like in the beginning it
just looks very value ad and then at the
end you're like edit oh wow this is
taking off thank you so much for anyone
asking because a lot of times the
comments will be asking like what's your
product I see and so then you can even
comment directly on those commenters
with your link as well okay so at the
end of the engagement after you have
certain posts or people commenting the
you couple hours yeah because Reddit
will show you exactly how many people
are are um viewing and reading your post

[1:00:03]
are are um viewing and reading your post
in any given moment and you'll see it
start to accelerate and so if it never
accelerates then there's never a point
to add the link but as it's like all
right 100 views an hour a thousand views
an hour 5,000 views an hour and also you
want to you want to go in the subreddits
and sort by top post by month by day all
time and you want to you want to make
your post a lot like that one right
like if it's braggadocious or if it's
humble or if it's telling a story like
it's different based on the subreddit
but just try to recreate what posts have
already been viral in that subet with
whatever you're doing yeah use the
formula yeah
yep do you if you if you go viral with a
certain Reddit post then do you copy and
paste for other subreddits that's so or
do you with the same account because it
will look like spammy right after they
check your profile
you do have to use the same account most
people are not going to check your

[1:01:00]
people are not going to check your
profile um you just have to do it in the
right way because it's it's really hard
to have a lot of Reddit accounts that
have good karma you you can buy Reddit
accounts um and I've had some luck with
that but eventually um they're likely to
get banned if you keep
doing hey um and that reminds I have 10
minutes right so yeah that reminds me
that the the Google SEO algorithm
changed right which to me it's like prti
in organic
content um produced by humans right
because people have used the AI organic
content quote unquote
so what are you using now for SEO to to
rank high in SEO are you posted
on no we haven't changed anything uh
maybe we should but we're just we're
keep doing we haven't really seen a hit
yet so yeah I'm been hit okay I think
it's still pretty early as far as like
the AI changes are concerned in

[1:02:00]
the AI changes are concerned in
SEO okay yeah sounds good uh I'll check
this gum gumy search looks interesting
to me yeah and I'll check the jungle
Scout yep thank thanks for all the good
advice on Twitter yeah always like your
post thank you Natt I appreciate
that all right we'll see you later all
right man thank you bye
bye all right Brigham
briam Chris can you hear me yeah how you
doing hey can you hear me all right I
can can you hear
me yeah there's a bad lag though yeah
there is I can hear you've got that Utah
accent well I've got some kind of accent
yeah so I've seen your name pop up in my
email a few times and on Twitter and you
seem like a guy that's a lot like me
just always hopping from thing to
thing yeah it's a curse honestly I my my

[1:03:02]
thing yeah it's a curse honestly I my my
parents sat me down a couple months ago
and saidon if you're gonna provide for
your family you really need to focus on
one thing and I said I'll do my best
okay well that's I mean they love you
that's what they do they do a lot okay
well uh let's hear about so from what I
understand you and your wife are working
for a popular fitness influencer
managing her comments and you want to
productize that somehow right yeah more
or less so I actually do digital
marketing my wife she works for this
influencer answering DMS and my sister
also works for her so I hear from both
of them a lot about what this influencer
does and I'd like to keep the the name
of the influencer quiet just because a
lot of this is still yep inel many
followers though huh how many followers
does she have 1.1 million so there
there's a lot and a lot of them are
she's a mom and kind of plays into the
mom thing and so a lot of them are in
similar phases of life so anyway they've

[1:04:02]
similar phases of life so anyway they've
got like Fitness and um some of the
health like foods and they have a line
of health foods and protein powders and
stuff like that that they've released as
well okay um a lot of the I'll just give
like a quick background on it a lot of
what um a lot of what my wife does is
she just answers questions so she
pretends to be this influencer answering
kind of in her tone they give trainings
on all of that kind of stuff they have a
lot of backend resources but they're all
like Excel spreadsheets where they have
common topics like when somebody asks
about a certain thing these are the
canned responses Y and um it's pretty
unsophisticated on the back end and then
on the client facing end all of her
content is being put out just on stories
and you know like Instagram essentially
is her landing page and so they've got a
website but it's kind of a crappy
website hard to follow not super easy to

[1:05:00]
website hard to follow not super easy to
navigate and you know a ton of affiliate
links and other stuff like that and then
they've got on the website there's a
whole section where they have ebooks
with a lot of her um thoughts and like
education and stuff and then a ton of
podcast material and other things like
that but it's none of it is centralized
in any way it's all just on Instagram so
as my wife's answering these questions
they're all questions that have been
posted about or there's an ebook about
there's a whole podcast episode about it
and so then my wife's whole job is
responding to these DMS and saying like
oh yeah I actually have great content
about this exact thing here it is um my
thought was I actually reached out to a
couple Fiverr creators to see if they
could create like a kajabi or teachable
course and my goal is to just take all
of the content that's publicly available
like on this lady's Instagram account or
her ebooks like the free ebooks or even
paid ebooks that are on her website and
then podcasts and scrape all of that

[1:06:01]
then podcasts and scrape all of that
content compile it into an easily
digestible thing and then pull a list of
her most active followers and run a
retargeting campaign on Facebook um my
question so this kind of gets into the
nuts and bolts of it is I've I've got
this lady's phone number because I've
been to like company parties with my
wife and things like that and you know
I've asked her questions and like I'm to
a point now where not like a you know a
best friend kind of a thing but at least
familiar enough that I could probably
reach out and say hey I've got a great
idea I'd love to sit down and ask you
about it yeah um but I don't know if
it'd be I mean i' I'd make a 100% of the
money if I just push the course out
myself versus bringing her in and having
her be the distribution the only issue
is just
that it kind of comes down to I don't
know what's copyrighted I don't know
what's yeah like if I I couldn't steal
her branding if area if she has nothing
to do with it yeah so I figured this is
kind of right up the Texas snacks alley

[1:07:02]
kind of right up the Texas snacks alley
where you're kind of the you're the
legal third- party seller for all of the
Texas snack stuff and you've worked out
kind of a comfortable yeah you know like
hey I won't step on your you on mine yep
so I'm just curious for your thoughts on
that yeah so I think that whatever you
might gain in like Revenue by just doing
the solo you will more than make up for
by partnering with her something somehow
and one thing that comes to mind
immediately uh which I didn't think of
before this call is using her content to
make a book like a physical book and
audio book or multiple books um I'm
pretty close friends with a guy that he
has like reverse engineered the Amazon
algorithm to get like reviews and to get
Amazon to promote you and to get like
certain Facebook groups for readers and
writers to promote you and good reads
and audio books and like he kind of he
wrote 20 to 25 books him and his wife
and then now he's packaging this up as

[1:08:01]
and then now he's packaging this up as
like an alternative to the traditional
distribution model which they take like
70% and he takes like 20 or 30% right um
and so I I think there's a world where
you could take all of our content use AI
to organize it and then use a human like
a similar a human of a similar
demographic that speaks this language um
maybe maybe like a mom that's really
good at writing right that is kind of in
this mom Instagram World um you could
use them to take like the outline that
AI gave you and actually write a
physical book or use AI to tell you like
all right what are five really popular
books a whole series of books that I
could write about all of these topics
that this one person is always talking
about um it's actually surprising how
much physical books and audio books can
make and the shelf life on these years
or decades right yeah and if you if you
were to to do that it doesn't have to
compete with a more expensive course it
could just go side by side right some

[1:09:01]
could just go side by side right some
people would rather read a physical book
or an audio book or have an ebook um the
physical book could be top of funnel for
something more expensive um but I like
the idea of you kind of acting as an
agent for her to go find a ghost riter
or to go find a company like I was just
talking about with my friend that can
actually do all of the work and you're
just frankly acting as a middleman and
maybe this third party company takes a
20 or 30% cut and you take a 20 or 30%
cut and she takes 51% or maybe you take
a 50% cut and she makes 20 or 30%
because a traditional publisher is going
to keep um 70% anyway right now granted
a traditional publisher would probably
give her an advance of 50 to
$500,000 um which I I wouldn't want to
do that yeah yeah I wouldn't suggest
that um but here's the thing like so my
friend approached me with this and I was

[1:10:00]
friend approached me with this and I was
immediately interested because the hard
part is writing the content and that's
done I write 100,000 words a month it's
all there on Twitter right yeah and for
her that's done it might be more video
format but you can easily take the
transcripts of these videos sure you can
automate that right and so I was a very
I was a very easy quote unquote sale for
him because I don't have to sit down and
write this and I don't have to do the
work and I still get a line L share of
the profits you know um yeah interesting
what do you think about that do you
think that could work with her and then
actually partner with her to do that so
she her distribution could just be the
cherry on top and you could tell her
like listen um you're G to help throw
gasoline on this fire but there's gonna
be a fire with or without you you know
yeah um I I like that idea as I was
talking with my I like the Swig Cup by
the way that's that's way more that's
way more Utah than my accent most Utah
thing you've ever seen um that's that's
a good quick call out for my subject

[1:11:01]
a good quick call out for my subject
line in the email I sent you the way
more Utah than my accent that's
hilarious um for those I I just
mentioned a subject line that I sent in
an email to you it was a whiter whale
than a Utah Dad yeah that's good that's
one of the best I've seen anyway the um
yeah I I like the idea of the book as I
was talking with my wife I I brought
that up actually and she was saying that
they've got kind of a really wise
Horizon on products that they want to
that they want to roll out and they've
got a limited team you know I think
they've got something like um 20
full-time employees including some
Warehouse people and stuff like that so
they they're spread really thin but I
think a book is on the horizon it's just
a matter of like whether that's you know
five years out on the horizon or in the
next couple months I'm not sure but so
maybe if I just said like hey all this
will be a completely done for you
service that yeah then maybe that would
be a lot more attractive I bet you
anything that if a book is on the
horizon which I'm sure I'm not surprised

[1:12:00]
horizon which I'm sure I'm not surprised
that it already is she probably already
has like a title or a concept in mind
right and I did too like I've always
wanted to write a book and I whether I
use my friend or not I'm gonna have a
book or multiple but like he brought to
me ideas that I had never thought of for
books and he's like dude you already
wrote about this and I was like oh okay
well if you're just gonna accelerate the
timeline um and bring me new book ideas
that I probably never would have
launched anyways than what do I have to
lose so maybe her stick is I'm making
this up like or organic produce right
and you're like listen like you talk
about organic produce a lot you want to
write a book on that great still do but
I've Al also noticed from your comments
and like there's these tangential topics
like organic fruit or holistic eating or
you know healing your body with with
fruit like that I could get written for
you that you're never going to write
about these anyway right and a lot of
times when let's say an author they're
they don't a hit book until book number
seven when number seven's a hit people

[1:13:00]
seven when number seven's a hit people
go back and buy one through six yeah
like it's a rising tide situation um I
just I just like that idea because it
doesn't have to compete with what you're
already thinking like of course it
doesn't have to compete with her um do
you know how big her business is like on
a yearly Revenue basis and or how big
her email list is I tried to I know that
she does do a newsletter I don't know
how big The Client List is um from
a oh my wife told me I think it was like
one month's numbers I can't remember
what it was but um they they're they're
growing really fast is the thing so
whatever numbers my wife would have told
me six months ago they've probably what
they're much
bigger I I don't have any idea I mean I
could probably back into him if I had a
little bit of time but I don't have them
right now okay yeah I mean you could
also say listen
uh there's going to be a lot of work for
this book so I'll give you 30% of it um

[1:14:00]
this book so I'll give you 30% of it um
but for every book you sell through your
affiliate link like if you think that
you're going to sell a lot more books
than me and my team are going to sell
great let's put your money where your
mouth is you're going to get 30% of
everything and then I'll give you 20% on
everything that sells through your links
right or 50% or whatever it is um that
could be more bargaining power to keep a
higher percentage um and you can also do
it where it's like listen let me just
write a chapter for you I'll give you an
outline I'll give you a chapter if the
chapter sucks then we can scrap this
whole project but sure I I definitely
think you want to work um with her and
find some very creative AI tools that
you don't really share with her but you
withhold and use to find some really
interesting topics or outlines that she
might not have thought of herself
because she's probably swamped right
yeah no that part is that much is very
true is that there's way too much on her
plate way too much on her team's plate
they're going in way too many directions
and so that was part of why I feel like
having a making a done for you offer

[1:15:01]
having a making a done for you offer
would be really attractive so let me
make sure I'm understanding you
correctly are you saying build the
course and Pitch the course but then
also
separately pitch a book idea as well and
come across as like hey we'll publish
your book for you and distribute your
book for you and you can be an
additional distributor of the book I
would just approach her first with kind
of both options stated Loosely right I'm
like I think the course idea could be
very profitable for this reason but I
think the book idea could be very
profitable with this reason like for
this reason are you okay with me just
taking your content and and putting a
couple things in front of you just to
see what you think and then maybe you
put like an outline for a course in
front of her and an outline for a book
with a title and like or two or three
different titles or concepts and then
kind of letting her steer uh the
decision- making from there okay because
if you're like you don't want to go all
in on one or the other because you kind
of want to hedge a little bit but you

[1:16:00]
of want to hedge a little bit but you
also don't want to sound wish
wishy-washy so I would sound very
factual like listen here's what here's
what you're gonna expect from a course
okay here's what you're gonna expect
from a book B I think they can go hand
in hand I think one can be top of the
funnel for the other I I want to start
working on both I already have the
content here are you cool if I just
start exploring something uh and we can
kind of work collaboratively um and then
I'm sure she'll say yes to that because
there's there's really no risk and then
start putting stuff together okay very
cool I I like the ideas I I think I'm
gonna I think I'm gonna mock something
up like a an example of a course and
then go get a couple um like you're
saying a couple ideas on book titles a
couple chapter outlines and then go sit
down with her yeah I love it well let me
know how it goes can I get one just one
additional thought on how to break down
the like an equity split or something
like that because you were saying
traditional publisher is something like
7030 in favor of the publisher um is

[1:17:01]
7030 in favor of the publisher um is
that would you recommend something
similar to that and then a 20% Kickback
on books that sell through her platforms
I think so I think that would be very
generous to you um so that might just be
a starting point um but if you were to
shake out at 5050 I think that's still
pretty good to you okay and then what
about on the core side of things same
similar
setup I think so yeah I would say just
just for for the sake of Simplicity I
would keep them the same okay cool yeah
all right I'll go do it and I'll I'll
send you an email and let you know how
it goes I love it man thanks a lot okay
thank you Chris yep see y see
you all right we've got
Gil hey hey how are you Gil can you hear
me yeah oh good how are you good thanks
for

[1:18:00]
for
joining yeah thanks for having me so if
I pull up your question I I I don't
really know anything about you I want
you've got an idea and you want some
feedback on
it yeah so basically I've been a
entrepreneur for like 10 years um life's
been kind of busy with the kids got a
four-year-old son who has autism so he's
taken up a lot of time we got a
20-month-old but we're getting to a
point where I have like some time to
finally start to do a project for myself
I've done other things in the past where
I started things up nothing really took
off I freelance graphic design like
renting a a trailer outdoorsy kind of
thing but I kind of am interested in
starting like a pro an item to sell on
Amazon okay so I kind I kind of just
have an idea I guess I'm looking for a
little bit of validation for my idea and
if it's good maybe what would be the
first steps into like having it made
okay so before we talk about your
product idea what first gave you the

[1:19:00]
product idea what first gave you the
idea to sell something on
Amazon I just with the the amount of
time that I have I because I could
always try to do freelancing but I'm
just like with the kids and everything I
just want to do something where I can
sell an item and just kind of be on the
back and not having to deal with like
clients and stuff like that at at this
point in my life right now that's the
ever elusive passive income right well
yeah guess passive in elusive passive
income but I mean obviously I know that
it's going to be a lot of work yeah so
and you know I kind so yeah was there
like do you follow someone on social
media that has been talking about this
like what what first gave you that
idea um for for like doing an Amazon
item yeah uh well I just uh you know
I've been listening to like you know
Noah Kagan I read his book you know I've
been the r SES of Tim ferris ferris and
all that so I wanted to address a pain a
pain point that I was having in my life
um and so that's kind of where the my

[1:20:01]
um and so that's kind of where the my
idea was well it be awesome if I had
this product even for myself there has
to be someone else out there that has
the same pain points yeah okay all right
what is your product idea uh so I have
it's an issue with my my glasses I have
three pairs of glasses that I use and um
they're scattered all over the place and
when whenever I go somewhere I kind of
have to take all three of them because
computer distance uh sunglasses
prescription and they're all over the
place and it's just kind of looks like
this and they're just like um so it's
just kind of a pain to find them and
everything so I thought it would be
great if if I had like a product where I
had these these cases that were all you
know magnetic that could just stick
together and then you know make so to
keep it everything organized in one spot
but then also maybe for TR have like a
little case that they could fit in so
just yeah so that's pretty much the idea

[1:21:00]
just yeah so that's pretty much the idea
I've kind of reached out to friends and
family about it and asked them for
feedback and I've gotten good feedback
my sister was like that's a great idea I
would totally buy that my one of my best
friends was like I wouldn't buy
that does he does he have glasses he
does why wouldn't he buy it I don't he
he said I wouldn't buy that but I can
see how some like really old people want
[Laughter]
I can see why a scile person would buy
this but I wouldn't Lucid person I mean
honestly it's nice to have friends that
are honest with you because I can't tell
you how many friends have told me oh
yeah I would do that and then I actually
do it and they're like oh well let me uh
you know yeah well he gave me good
feedback yeah sorry can you give me just
a second I have someone at the door yeah
give me just a second no
problem for

[1:22:52]
sure stay
all
right all right you there Gil uh yes

[1:23:02]
right all right you there Gil uh yes
sir all right um sorry I just had a lawn
mower
delivered I wanted to make sure that uh
I got the lawnmower um all right so your
friend you had some say I would buy it
and one said I wouldn't how many people
have you talked to
specifically I think it was like I
reached out to all my family so probably
like almost 10 people okay and what
percentage would buy it
um well some of them don't have glasses
so don't wear glasses so I I would say
that the people that that wore glasses
told me yes you know except for my
friend Adam now would it be like a
magnet that holds them together or like
would it be a case what would it look
like exactly I was envisioning something
like it's just like a rectangular case
like this and it would have like a
magnetic panel on the inside like a very

[1:24:00]
magnetic panel on the inside like a very
thin magnetic panel and then they would
all just kind of stick together and then
like we could put it inside a little
container that would have a little space
for like your wallet watch or something
else maybe something you could put on
your bed on your stand next to your on
your nightstand or anywhere okay so it
really could just look like I'm
picturing some something the shape
almost like a matchbox
right just something rectangular but as
as thin as possible that had magnets on
the inside that just they they could
stand alone as their own case but they
also they they're stuck together right
yes exactly I like that idea because
it's not like you could just take
existing stuff and piece it together
right you don't have to go get molds
made
um I like it for that reason I mean you
could even make that in your living room
just with ma magnets and boxes yeah and
I was I was thinking I would do it start
with like just taking some cardboard you
know some cartons and just like cutting

[1:25:01]
know some cartons and just like cutting
it all up and just kind of just to get
the visual of what it's looks like so
one problem I foresee with this is
selling it on Amazon because on Amazon
you got to match search traffic yeah and
people
are have you done any research on Amazon
searches like with jungle Scout to see
what type of glasses accessory people
are already searching for today I
haven't looked on uh with jungle Scout I
did search on Amazon for glasses cases
and like Google and stuff I didn't see a
product like this out there that that
existed yet but um I kind of feel like
it's kind of Niche so that it was like
hard to kind of keyword uh search it
something like this okay because you can
look up glasses cases and you know
you're just going to pop up generic
cases
yeah so I'll tell you all the reasons
why I do and don't like this idea okay

[1:26:00]
why I do and don't like this idea okay
uh I like it
because uh you could you could put it
together in your living room pretty
easily um you could buy existing things
and put it together um it's cheap it's a
cheap it's cheap to buy it's cheap to
make um and it serves what 30% have
glasses maybe 20 30% of the overall
population you could ship it fairly uh
cheaply it's weight um it's under 13
ounces which is key which means you can
ship it with USPS first class which is
significantly cheaper than priority um
so I like that why I don't like it is wa
another reason why I really really like
it the biggest reason is it's very short
form
viral right in a 5c clip you could show
people exactly what the value
proposition is yeah and so I feel like
that more than outweighs the lack of
search traffic on Amazon for it yeah you
if you get this in the right hands on
Instagram and Tik Tok it could go

[1:27:01]
Instagram and Tik Tok it could go
massively viral um the problem with that
is is that you're gonna want to push
them to Amazon as opposed to a Shopify
site because that's where people are are
comfortable and so you've got to name
this something very specific and so
you're going to create Amazon search
traffic um okay instead of try to Piggy
back on something else and so I would
make it like a something with the word
mag in it like mag case or or just
something silly like Rhino case
something I would do a lot of research
on the name I think the name is
incredibly important in this case
whereas most of the times I don't think
the name is very important um make it
something very brandable like with a
color or a shape or um like purple
rectangle or or Purple Rhino or
something to where when you go on Amazon
today and you start typ it there is no
Auto auto complete like Amazon doesn't
know where you're going with it yeah um
because you can like it's just hard to

[1:28:01]
because you can like it's just hard to
link to things in short form video um so
you just want to call it something so
people know what to search for now then
eventually you could have a shop if I
say site it's the same name and I would
definitely recommend getting only a. of
that name like not your name plus case
but like just yourname.com so then
because some people are going to go to
Tik Tok to search it some people will go
to YouTube to search it some will go to
Amazon and some will go to Google to
search it you want to be creating all of
that search traffic from a brand new
invented term um I really really like
that about it because I've seen stupid
short form videos of products like this
that have 30 million views 50 million
views perfect case study for you um
Kevin aspir to do you know who that is
no he founded the Epic gardening Channel
um he was recently interviewed on my
first million and he sells a very viral
product that's like a knee brace that
helps you kneel in the garden better and

[1:29:02]
helps you kneel in the garden better and
they cannot keep them in stock wow the
reason why is because a it FS a need and
B it is so viral video right it is just
so easily it it so easily portrays the
value proposition in 5 seconds or less
even 3 seconds his video is just like
someone kneeling in the garden with a
bracel around it and it's like I get it
immediately I need it I want it it's
springtime I'm gardening product Market
fit product audience fit viral video fit
all of the above um so I really like the
idea for that reason um I why I don't
like the idea is it could be copied okay
so someone could see your a VI your
viral video and then just start
piggybacking and I think if you're first
you will stay first but they're just
going to start chipping away your market
share yeah um and I don't like that you
can't sell it for that much because if
you wanted to lean on paid ads for this

[1:30:00]
you wanted to lean on paid ads for this
you need it to be like at least a $50
product which this is not right yeah
what what do you think this would be at
20 or less 20 or less I think it just
has to be cheap yeah yeah it couldn't be
like like try to make it like a bit of a
luxury item or something that was like
super nice and like you should have two
versions you should have like super like
a leather
or pleather version and then like a
plastic version okay um I think a lot of
people will upgrade to the nicer version
once they try the cheap version and see
that they like it okay
um but I do think this is a good idea
it's not going to be passive at all but
that's I think it'll be more successful
than what something passive might be
yeah and it would be a I mean awesome if
this were something that eventually it
would replace my you know my income that
I'm getting from my job you know because
right now fulltime and that's the end
goal is to create something on the side
that eventually will allow me to quit my

[1:31:00]
that eventually will allow me to quit my
job yep yeah and I I think it could I
mean if you're excited about it how long
have you had this
idea um ever since I the Noah Kagan book
came out so when that book came out I
read it and that's kind of what like
spurred me to think I'm going to think
about something that I have a pain point
that I to fix so that's kind of so
probably how long's that book been out
can't remember some month couple months
yeah so are you like an ideas guy are
you always having ideas
yeah okay I mean that's okay and this if
this is one that you just can't get out
of your head then I think that's send a
signal to its efficacy yeah I mean I'm
an ideas guy but a lot of them just come
and go but if it sticks around then I
got to do something about it okay yeah
so building it um like you're saying
just kind of creates some prototypes at
home and start off what what would you
think would be the next step after
that

[1:32:01]
um I would just I would try to make like
a hundred in your living room okay and
try to sell those to friends and family
in Facebook groups or whatever start
doing a lot more Market Research in
Facebook groups for people that might
buy this and on Reddit and just learning
either by posting and asking or just
reading old comments um
what they would like this to look like
um and then I would make a 100 I would
sell them to friends and family and ask
for all the feedback in the world make
changes maybe they're going to want
round corners or something make changes
based on that and then find out how long
it takes you to assemble these things
from raw materials to finish product and
assign that into your cost like all
right if I sell this for 20 bucks it's
gonna if I pay someone $20 an hour being
conservative to put these together I can
do 10 an hour that mean they're probably
only only going to do five per hour so
if I'm conservative on their wage and
I'm conservative on the time it's going
to cost a dollar per labor to put these

[1:33:01]
to cost a dollar per labor to put these
together it costs $4 to make them I've
got a 75% gross margin that's a really
good margin uh if I add in shipping that
cuts my margin to 50% do all that math
and then start to play around with
actually selling these uh on Amazon and
I would just list them on Amazon kind of
see how it goes see if you can capture
any organic traffic and then phase three
would be try to get this uh video in the
hands of someone that can make it go
viral uh just start dming people or on
your own personal account or make an
account just you definitely want to make
an account just for this product and
then see if you can push some ads behind
it on Instagram reels and if your if
your CPM on these ads is really really
low then it means that um Instagram is
showing it for free to a lot more people
because they're engaging with it and
it's keeping them on the platform okay
most times I don't recommend you push
like Instagram reels via ads but this is
a this is a paid product and that you

[1:34:00]
a this is a paid product and that you
will want to do that with this okay and
you think this it's better to do that
than like try to have something
manufactured like in China or like
designed and manufactured in China to
yeah I just I would order the raw
materials from China but assemble them
here because it's going to be very
expensive once these are assembled to
get them here in shipping containers and
it's that just adds another layer of
complexity so let's say you're just
putting you're ordering identical boxes
and putting three of them together and
then two magnets in between the three
boxes and putting them together um it's
going to be very expensive for them to
be assembled in China and then shipped
here like literally three times more
expensive because of the all the the
volume because when you ship stuff
you've got physical weight and then you
have what's called um oh what's it
called it's like the weight volume it's
the cost based on I don't remember what
the the phrase is for it
but if it's very simple to assemble

[1:35:00]
but if it's very simple to assemble
these I would recommend doing it in
house and being in control of that
process because one thing that could
sync you is if you know your first
shipment of 10,000 of these are all put
together wrong that could that could
crush you and then a competitor could
swoop right in and take the number one
spot okay cool all
right yeah man aesome well let me know
how it goes I want to hear I'm excited
about this for you I think it's a good
idea I was prepared to tell it was a bad
idea I don't I don't think it is awesome
great thank you so much Chris appreciate
your time you're welcome yep good luck
all right thank you yeah
bye all right I have no one else waiting
right now
so Chase was going to join but he has
not joined so I'm going to read some
pre-submitted filler questions
[Music]
so let's see what we got here

[1:36:03]
so we've got a couple people on YouTube
that're interested to ask a question so
I'm going to do something I've never
done and see if I can post this link in
YouTube um and Jos or Cindy maybe you
want to join and we can see how that
goes um am I going to do another video
on cremation or retail
meat retail meat okay like quarter
cows uh I'm sure I will at some point
but I don't have it on like the
immediate
timeline
um yeah let's see if we get some people
to join
here I'll go ahead and read a pres
submitted question while I wait so this
guy
says here's a good one this is a topic
suggestion for a future podcast
something I see for sale occasionally
are sales routes for things like
tortilla brands or soda brands I would

[1:37:02]
tortilla brands or soda brands I would
also add like FedEx routes the numbers
are always they always throw around
always seem too good to be true but at
the very least I figured it would be
cool to get your take on them loving the
podcast so keep it up so I know exactly
what you're talking about you go to bis
by sell and you say all right I want
$200,000 per year profit businesses with
the lowest multiple oh this is a Mission
tortilla route in Northeast Texas um
that Nets $200,000 a year and they're
selling it for $400,000 a year I don't
like these businesses I've looked into
these businesses before I don't like it
because usually if not all of the time
you're buying yourself a job and a
really sucky job at that usually to make
those numbers work you either have to do
it yourself or you have to hire a driver
at $75,000 a year which comes with all
kinds of complexities my good friend
Keith former owner of Heartland Bread
Company the bane of his existence was
delivering that bread and picking up the

[1:38:00]
delivering that bread and picking up the
bread that never sold to all of the
grocery stores it's not fun like
Logistics is hard and so if someone's
selling a business that's in logistics
at an attractive multiple I would stay
far away from it especially since there
are thousands of other Industries with
attractive multiples that you could buy
into that have much less headache so uh
yeah
[Music]
let's go to another question
here
okay all
right this person says I'm very
interested in Ai and the potential you
see with it is there any practical use
case or idea you have about starting a
business related to AI whether it be an

[1:39:00]
business related to AI whether it be an
AI agency implementation into existing
service businesses teaching people AI
automation integration with zapier slm
in essence if you were to force to make
money start a business related around AI
what would you do specifically if you
have limited capital A lot of free time
but the ability to learn no code
software and technical things things
great question here's what I would do
I would help business owners and
individuals make llms language learning
models um specifically from their email
accounts there's a big hole in the
market and I think eventually it's going
to get filled with Google or open aai
but right now these big companies are
very afraid to tie AI to our inboxes uh
because of the privacy concerns around
that but there are a dozen ways to throw
something together and so anytime I see
an industry that's emerging where people
are finding creative hacks and
workarounds to put something together

[1:40:01]
workarounds to put something together
that's usually a really big opportunity
and so I think there's a world where you
could approach people like me that has
an inbox which with lots of data in it
for instance I raise money for RV parks
and in one of my inboxes Chris coof
founders.com that's the only one I use
to email with potential investors or
current investors and they ask they ask
all of the same questions 15 to 20
questions how does bonus depreciation
work what's the minimum investment size
I would love for someone that could go
into my inbox export all those emails
and I've done this myself it's it's it's
grind it is possible but it takes a long
time and then it takes a long time to
learn how to interact with that on a
regular basis anyway someone that could
take all of my emails and segregate out
the ones that are only with investors
and I don't want a chatbot I want
basically a repository of answers
um where I could just plug in answers
anytime an uh potential investor asks
that question I think there's a world

[1:41:00]
that question I think there's a world
where you can do that at a service as a
service primarily to businesses that
have employees that are all kind of
asked the same types of questions chat
Bots have been around they are around
but this is different um you need kind
of like you can make FAQs out of your
inbox um or something something like
that but I also really like the idea of
automation agencies charging $2 to
$3,000 a month to basically be that
person that that company calls on
anytime they need an automation made
maybe the automation doesn't use AI at
all maybe uh it does so for Texas snacks
I built this thing that will
automatically email customers the day
that their package arrives um and then
when they email them it'll even include
a tidbit about the city that they live
in so it does not look AI generated and
it has really increased our repeat order
rate because people feel like they're
creating a one-on-one relationship with
the brand uh whereas usually when Brands

[1:42:01]
the brand uh whereas usually when Brands
send emails it's full color splashy
looks very professional but it's not
personal at all and I think email is
moving away from that so to answer your
question I see two things help craft
llms from Ai and make the the data in
those llms very accessible and just
automation agencies that may use Ai and
may not not because most small to
mediumsized companies have automation
needs but they can't afford or they
can't even justify hiring someone that
costs six to $10,000 a month they'd much
rather pay you $2,000 a month maybe
4,000 the first month and then, 1500
ongoing to fix things as they break
because they will
break couple more pres submitted
questions
Chase if you're watching this we missed

[1:43:00]
Chase if you're watching this we missed
you today I was excited about your
question I hope you feel guilty right
now just
kidding all
right all right I love this question I'm
24 W2 Finance job ever eventually want
to start a business of some sort I'm
married with a baby on the way in the
fall which does limit my risk tolerance
however I'm not afraid to take smart
risks I'm looking to build something in
off hours from work a business that's
promoted often is Amazon FBA or Retail
Arbitrage I haven't heard you speak on
this in the past I was curious your take
could this be viable for making a 5
figure income on the side that could
give me leverage to jump into something
else or does the capped ceiling make it
less attractive option compared to other
Alternatives would love to hear your
thoughts but also if there are any go-to
steps you would take if you were in my

[1:44:01]
steps you would take if you were in my
position to looking to start an
entrepreneurship so all right I have
many thoughts on this he's asking if he
can use Retail Arbitrage or Amazon FBA
or whatever to make money on the side so
the previous caller just asked me about
this but he's doing something different
he wants to develop a real physical
product That's Unique uh that he sells
on Amazon and if you remember I
suggested that he assemble this in his
house import the raw materials from
China and basically own the whole
vertical except the logistics and the
third party side of logistics which he's
going to give to Amazon but Shopify side
he will manage himself I owned a
third-party logistics company and even I
would not suggest to most companies that
they Outsource that with rare
exception I don't like the idea of
people using FBA or Arbitrage in most
instances to try to make money I I think
this Market is very crowded um because
of the fact that there are so many other

[1:45:00]
of the fact that there are so many other
24 yearolds that tried this tasted some
success maybe they made a $2,000 profit
in a month and then they went to
Instagram and they saw a guy talking
about how he makes $200,000 a month and
he thought H I bet there's a lot more
money in teaching people how to do this
than there is in me doing this myself
because man this is actually kind of a
grind this is you know e-commerce is
hard like e-commerce is not passive it
is very hard and you're competing with
everyone in the world and so there is
more money in teaching people how to do
Amazon FBA than there is in starting
Amazon FBA now if you're a big company
already doing it great or if you want to
invest a lot of time and money into
research and development importing stuff
from China that's one thing but if
you're just trying to make a side income
I don't recommend Amazon FBA okay
because you're going to be competing
with everyone else that is buying a
course from that 23y Old shirtless dude
that posts pictures of himself with
other people's Lamborghinis Okay I would

[1:46:01]
other people's Lamborghinis Okay I would
definitely recommend starting something
that you learn about on the internet
from someone who is not incentivized to
sell you that thing for instance I'm
always tweeting about home service
businesses about gutter cleaning about
Seamless Gutters about lawn care about
pressure washing and I'm not trying to
sell you a course on how to start a
pressure washing business I'm going to
show you in a 1500 wor tweet how to do
it yourself and if you do it great if
you don't great I'm not incentivized if
you do that or not okay so find people
that are putting out good content
encouraging you to start businesses that
are not monetarily incentivized to get
you to start that business and that's
probably going to be a good business but
that content is hard to find mostly it's
on Twitter uh actually there's a lot on
YouTube because people uh on YouTube are
incentivized by YouTube to get more
views so YouTube can pay them they're
not most of them are not selling Co
directly so I do see really high quality
how to start a business content on
YouTube but generally speaking there is

[1:47:00]
YouTube but generally speaking there is
a direct correlation between how kind of
ugly a business is and how much profit
you can make from it whereas there's
also direct correlation between how sexy
and passive a business looks and how
much money you're likely to lose on it
uh because of the fact that people are
simply incentivized to make riches look
very easy as the hook so they can sell
you course and then once you bought the
course they don't care what happens to
you they don't care if you win or lose
so those are my thoughts on
that all right well I think that's a lot
of content for today so thank you for
joining us on the K the ker office for
all of you that were tuning in Live on
YouTube I appreciate you you and
um do you know about fill by Tik Tok
someone on YouTube is asking do I know

[1:48:00]
someone on YouTube is asking do I know
about fulfill by Tik Tok I really don't
honestly I'd love to be able to spat off
some facts there I do think that the
e-commerce days in Tik Tok are very
young very early and there's room
there's still a lot of room to make
money there whereas Amazon is like it's
tired at this point so anyway thank you
to all that were live streaming and we
will see you next
time
