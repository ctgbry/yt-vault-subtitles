[00:00]
welcome to the ker office this is part
two of the hold C Bros episode that we
started last week Nick and I we're going
to talk about a kind of weird funky
trampoline idea business mattress idea
building the Brookstone of the 21st
century that weird store in the mall
that has viral stupid impulse five
products then we're talk about using
creators to grow your business which
we've talked about before but in a
different way and I think you'll like it
so please subscribe leave me a review
share with your friends go check out
Nick onomics that's Nick's podcast as
well and we'll see you next time
okay I have an idea that is a it's a
stupid idea I'm tell you right now so
don't make me feel insecure because I
know it's stupid okay but I I don't feel
insecure that doesn't happen anyway I'm
really secure but I want you to try to
make it better okay yeah have you ever
seen a video of trampoline so us you
know snowflake Millennials the
trampolines that we buy nowadays have
the big walls on them and because we
don't you know heaven forbid we fall off

[01:00]
don't you know heaven forbid we fall off
the trampoline right and the trampoline
my backyard has a protective wall around
it they they all come standard that way
you ever seen a video of those like
going airborne and just like completely
flying away yeah they're like big sails
that just sit there in your backyard
okay okay true story I have 20 acres of
vacant land to to the east of me 20
acres of vacant land to the west of me
owned by other people and the land to
the west of me you know the wind is
always blowing when there's a big storm
it'll blow to the West has exactly two
trampolines on it right now from
me because the wind yeah the wind picked
him up carried him over to the trees on
the other side of my property and one
time we got home from vacation and then
we're like oh our trampoline gone oh
it's in the neighbor's yard okay I guess
we'll get another one and I just never
picked it up it's still there it's like
an old Relic from 2017 oh because it was
completely trashed and
broken so like one day I'm going to have
to get those things

[02:01]
to get those things
because it's not my land and it's still
there yeah here we go here we
go what up I was asking like why didn't
you go get it off of your neighbor's
land and you were like you thought my
question was why didn't you get it so
you could use it again and your answer
was oh because it was trashed and
broken yeah if I could still use it I
would go get it right right but since
his trash are broke just like leave it
on your neighbor's land no no foul I got
to quote George ganza right now in the
episode where he has inappropriate
relations with his the janitor of his
office okay and his boss finds out and
he goes is that wrong was I wrong was
that wrong so that's my question is that
wrong should I go get those trampolines
oh
my Somewhere Out There my neighbor is
listening to this and he's like what the
heck what the I got two trampolines back
there be renting those out for $30 a day
you how much money I could be
making I mean that land's been vacant

[03:00]
making I mean that land's been vacant
for decades and no one's ever there so
I'll get them eventually who's it
hurting anyway my point is those things
went airborne and the second one I had
Stak down and it still went Airborne
okay so here's the idea and it's it's
not a business it's a product and I
think it would sell but it wouldn't be a
big business and I think it's dumb on
the
surface I think you could there's a
world where you could sell like a
trampoline safety kit okay where it's
like I'm picturing a flag like a little
flag that you attach to the top of the
the sidewall that's just heavy enough to
where you know if it's blowing in the
wind then the wind is too strong and you
should freaking get your kids inside or
they're going to be airborne too does
that make sense totally so it's like if
it's 20 m per hour wind or more the flag
is waving and no one should be on the
Lane watch out whereas if it's not
it's a little windy then whatever or it
comes with that it comes with a tie down
kit maybe $50 maybe $100 and it's just
peace of mind for a parent to feel like

[04:00]
peace of mind for a parent to feel like
their investment is safer and that their
children are safer and I think it would
sell because you could use short form
video of trampling going airborne right
you could even make it a little funny or
you could Photoshop some kids in there
or something and I think the fear would
sell really where well so we're goingon
to brainstorm on this I'm freaked out at
the moment though because like is this a
real problem I me like are there like
dozens of kids who die a year because
the trampoline got picked up moved to
the other yard well let's find out like
that is just crazy to
me because my first thought is I don't
need to help them have like a flag to
say It's windy I'd be like help them
move out of
Texas a moving
company all right so here's my first
idea I'm on board with the flag here's
the problem with the flag the flag is a
reactive mechanism you need to see it
and then it tells you to do something
what if instead the trampoline maker
charged since apparently it's a problem

[05:01]
charged since apparently it's a problem
in Texas I don't know 50 cents a month
for an app and all the app did was send
them notifications when the
weather was outside of a certain
parameter let's say when hit at okay
okay or like lightning right from like a
thunderstorm or hail storm was coming so
and everybody's been sitting in church
when all of a sudden you just
hear and it's an amber alert I would
think that there's some way to allow
your phone to notify you if something's
happening but that would be I think
something that parents would be really
interested in it's like okay I'll pay a
buck a month 12 bucks a year I don't
even I don't know what it would have to
be but let's just say it's a buck a
month 12 bucks a year for the peace of
mind that this app's going to notify me
when there's inclement weather so that I
can go pull my kids inside all right can
I level that up with a distribution
strategy ABS
aoly to me this is like a white whale
business because you build an app I
don't think it would cost that much or

[06:01]
don't think it would cost that much or
take that long and then you just need
one customer you need one or two
customers and you say listen we're not
going to pay you anything um but your
trampoline is now going to be better
than all the other trampolines out there
because it's going to come with this app
and to be fair there like how many
competitors are there in the trampoline
market right yeah right maybe you go to
Springfree right because they're like
the premium option and you say do your
customers not have to pay but you're
going to pay us a licensing fee so
basically anytime anyone downloads that
app you're going to pay us a dollar a
month or a dollar one time or $50 one
time or whatever and that's going to
enable you to sell more trampoline
because it's going to come it's going to
be Tech enabled I think it's going to be
hard to get a consumer to pay for this I
think it would be easier to find one
decision maker that would pay a little
bit for this for everyone that downloads
the app and actually uses it interesting
I just like it because it's like sell to
one to sell to a million right you got
to get that one decision maker you could
do that before you even build the app
right yeah because almost ready I can't
imagine the app's really hard to build
you just tap into existing I don't know

[07:01]
you just tap into existing I don't know
weather reporting sources and then
notifying people after it exceeds
certain parameters that you set for it
you could even sell the app to other
like outdoor kids product type companies
right where it's like you're all right
you're going to be the you know pay me
this much and I'm going to sell it to
all the trampoline companies or pay me
this much and you're exclusive to the
trampoline companies there could be a
premium model for a physical product if
you were able to like way out of my
depth here but install some component to
the trampoline itself that was that
could easily recognize that it's
airborne and then
immediately again this would cost a lot
of money I don't know how much it would
cost but like immediately disengage all
the Springs so that the mat itself just
drops out so it doesn't become a saale
does that make sense what I'm saying
like the reason it becomes a sail is
because it's lifting up from underneath
I think if you ignore physics it makes
sense
why I I don't know how you disengage all

[08:00]
why I I don't know how you disengage all
the Springs like technically speaking
well like you put together a trampoline
they come fitted with little slots and
so the Springs are hooked on the one
side to the metal base and then they're
hooked on the other side to the canvas
whatever you want to call
it like I could see a scenario if you
built it out that there's a mechanism
that
disengages on the metal side right like
it just elongates I don't even know what
how you would do it but just disengages
and then makes the trampoline so that
tarp or whatever the canvas just drops
to the ground and yeah you probably lose
the canvas but at least your kids are
not Airborne in the neighbor's yard I
could see it being more of something
like where the walls like if the walls
have enough wind pressure they would
just like
collapse right and so they can no longer
catch wind because I bet you anything
it's the walls that are making these
things really fly a lot more than just
the trampoline all by itself well the
problem with that is like the point of
the wall is you don't want your kids to

[09:00]
the wall is you don't want your kids to
fly out of it right right and so if it
was if the walls were weak enough where
the wind pressure would cause it to
collapse it's probably not going to
catch your kids if they're flying off of
the trampoline yeah I'm thinking I'm
picturing like a hinge like if the walls
were on like a hinge that only collaps
when enough pressure was put on them so
even if the kids were like jumping on it
and like the wall starts to cave in on
them it's like oh geez yeah better go
inside you know what I'm saying dude
someone's gonna be listening to this
yelling at their I know we sound so
stupid right now we need stop the point
is the point is and I think there's a
business idea here is finding things
that parents are willing to spend money
on in order to give themselves peace of
mind I would spend like if I lived in
Texas and that was a problem I'd spend
money on that because it's like yeah I
want you to notify me if there's a
twister period right and that's probably
applicable sort of framework to use to
find other business opportunities what
are parents going to spend money on
another way you could do this I like a
year ago I talked to the owner of

[10:00]
year ago I talked to the owner of
trampolines.com randomly from Twitter I
don't know how he found me or I found
him okay but what they do is they
sell they sell ingr trampolines which
are not susceptible to being blown
around and then they sell the install
and so I think he actually paid for a
Consulting call with me to figure out
like how to build a nationwide network
of installers because that was their
their problem wasn't selling ingr
trampolines their problem was Finding
reliable people nearby to dig the
freaking hole to bury the things there's
probably a place there where you could
like refer business to these guys or I
don't know yeah that's interesting
because they've already got a network of
people who they have actually sold to
yeah and it's like oh actually for
everyone else that you go out to do this
install and it may not work for them
right because they're doing inground
trampolines they're not going to be
airborne but like the idea is there are
probably networks of these people who
are doing installs of the Treehouse or
kids play kit or like the swing set or
other trampolines and that could be an
add-on service where it's like

[11:00]
add-on service where it's like
here's the distribution channel for you
to sell and you'll get X percentage of
whatever we sell this is reminding me of
another dumb idea that I had from oh 13
years ago remember when the tornadoes
came through Alabama uhuh what
[Music]
happened I'm kidding yes I remember I
know geez Louise you bring it up like
every
week oh gosh don't embarrass me in front
of my friends okay mouhammad edit this
out Muhammad if anything sounds me makes
me sound bad edit it out anyway so this
is a dumb idea but I think you could
make it good so tornadoes came through
Alabama what does everyone say when
tornadoes come through probably don't
know because you've never lived in an
area like and your wife same person get
in the seller is that not what they say
seller seller all right you get a
mattress you get a mattress and you you
like get in the bathtub you get a
mattress you put it over you okay or you
get under a mattress somehow really yeah
okay yeah that's the thing so when this
happened like you live in Alabama
everyone's heard that but then the

[12:00]
everyone's heard that but then the
tornado actually comes and it's like all
right let's we know what to do get the
mattress have you ever tried picking up
and lifting a mattress over you
yeah I'm trying to think of an analogy
like that's like saying all right if you
get in a car wreck you're about to get
in a car wreck just hold on to the wheel
real tight you won't go anywhere it's
like um hey if if there's a hail storm
outside grab a sack of potatoes and
you're going to run in the street for
three miles in order to protect yourself
it's like one of those things you
actually think about how it's going to
impact you anyway I get it if you're in
a hail storm just don't get hit by hail
it's not that hard oh what the hell I
saw that coming a mile away had to do it
all right if you are watching this clip
right now you are watching this on
YouTube and if you are a fan of podcast
please check out my podcast while you're
at it because sometimes I have podcasts
that aren't on YouTube and sometimes I
have YouTubes that aren't on podcast so
check out the ker office on any podcast
platform or you can go to TKO pod.com
also my newsletter will throw that in
there there are no ads It's weekly it's
different content than my podcast and

[13:01]
different content than my podcast and
YouTube newsletter. chrisj cerner.com
You'll see the link and we'll see you
there anyway so I thought I wonder if
you could like patent this very simple
technology and license it to a mattress
manufacturer where it's like literally
just straps underneath a mattress like a
carrying strap it's like okay for movers
it's easier to carry and if for some
weird reason you're in a tornado it's
easier to pick up and protect yourself
just like a simple strap and you get it
patented and then you license it it's
like for every match that you sell give
me five bucks that would be interesting
here's a problem with it it's like think
about it like this in an airplane let's
say that of all the airplanes in all in
in the United States there are you
combine all the seats from all the
airplanes and let's just say there's
like a million seats I'm just guessing I
don't know I have no idea how many seats
there are and then you said hey let's
just increase the length of the seat Bel
by 6 in each you're okay that's 6 in

[14:00]
by 6 in each you're okay that's 6 in
times a million fets like it very
quickly adds up to a lot and these are
like really low margin businesses so I
do wonder if the mattress company would
be like dude in order for us to add the
handles you know how much that would
cost like this is how many mattresses
we're producing each year it's going to
cost us an extra like $10 million and
that's like all of our bottom line but I
don't think it's a bad idea I think it
would be more suited like there's got to
be like a shark tank product have you
ever seen those have you ever seen those
commercials with the guy who's like this
to anything like water's gushing out of
this tank and he like stops the leak MH
so I would think maybe you have those
and you buy them aftermarket and it's
velcro and it just is really consumer
exactly right and it's really sticky and
it just attaches to the mattress itself
and so then you don't have to worry
about convincing the mattress company
you just sell it directly to the
consumer and it's like make this a part
of your tornado kit don't forget about
your handlebars I don't know what you
would call them Tor tornado handles
there's someone right now saying oh my
gosh tornado handles.com I have to buy

[15:00]
gosh tornado handles.com I have to buy
that I have to buy
that I wonder if the play is to go
direct to
Consumer a to make money B to show how
much demand there is or not to a
mattress manufacturer and say hey
there's something to this we've done the
research it's going to cost you an extra
$7 per mattress you can pass that on and
we'll give you an exclusive to this
technology that's a cool product it's
not a terrible idea it's not your
worst thanks thanks Mom next
so you posted something I can't remember
if it was this the week or last week
whatever and I didn't read the whole
post I just saw like the hook and it was
like this video got 80 million views I
think there's a business here and this
is what I would do if I was like trying
to take advantage of it was that the
mini Jeeps it was not the mini Jeeps it
was like the guy in a river and you
would buy a bunch of inflatable stuff I
can't remember who it was anyways like
the point of it was that you were
finding viral video and then you were

[16:00]
finding viral video and then you were
telling people how there could possibly
be a business based on this and I
thought that was really interesting to
me of and this isn't necessarily novel
right like anytime something goes viral
the hawk to a girl
or founder mode or like anything like
that a product magically appears so
there there's obviously people who are
looking at the internet and just like
looking for virality in order to trigger
a business idea and they're just like
trying to make money it's like similar
to the idea that we were talking about
earlier where it's a fad like Nikita
beer and he made really good money in
the short window of time that's like
these people's whole business model I
think that's stressful that I'm not like
advocating for that but what I do think
is interesting is there are these
businesses or moments in time that you
can take advantage of perfuma is one of
those you posted this video it got a ton
of views people started reaching out and
asking about it and so we're we're
building a business off of it I
think there have been some attempts at
this I can't remember the name of the

[17:00]
this I can't remember the name of the
app but who's the guy that's always like
are you on Tik Tok Gary ve Gary ve Gary
ve talked about this app where it shows
what's trending and like Twitter has a
trending Tab and there break break the
web break the web that's what it is
there's like break the web Twitter has
the trending Tab and it shows you like
the trending topics I think if there was
somebody who just like really loved
social media they could build a
community
that very similar to the way these let
me back up you're in crypto and you've
been in discords on crypto many of these
Discord groups are like kind of pump and
dump where it's ain't no kind of about
it it starts in the Discord group it
gains momentum and like if you're a part
of the right Discord group you can make
$2 million because you caught the wave
early and everybody else who's buying
later like has missed out on that wave I
I think there could be something like a
a group that you could build that is
just around verality so like you find
out about founder mode in the first 12

[18:01]
out about founder mode in the first 12
hours not four days later you find out
about Haka in the first six hours not
three days later and you don't
necessarily act on every single one of
these ideas but maybe you own a a a
printing company and you see the HW Tu a
girl and you I don't know throw up a
landing page really quickly and start
selling some banners I think there's a
bunch of different ways that small
businesses could actually take advantage
of some of these viral Trends if they
were able to catch them early like
that's the biggest thing is you have to
catch it early because if you're
catching it when everybody else sees it
there's already a landing page somebody
else has already like staked out that
opportunity so creating a group that you
charge for people to be a part of where
essentially you're curating viral
content and then sending out updates
really quickly when something is
trending or like when something you're
like hey this has all the markers of
something that's going to go viral I'm
sure there's like a science to it that
some of these companies do take a
lookout for this and so again you're not
acting on every single one of these
but if you're like you and I it's like

[19:01]
but if you're like you and I it's like
oh I think I could do this business
because of this infrastructure that
we've built boom you jump on it and you
make $100,000 what do you think I like
it so are you saying that you make money
by arranging the community and charging
for access it could be both-sided right
like I but I just don't know of the
community that currently exist like if
there was a community that currently
existed that we could join that would
tell us
something on the uptick of it going
viral I think we would join that I just
don't know that it exists it kind of EX
exists with Twitter or Instagram just
because it's shown to you in your feed
but something that's like hey this just
passed 400,000 views and it's passed it
in less than two hours I think this is
something that's going to hit 80 million
you guys you know you should hop on it
so I'm speaking more about creating the
community that sends out those signals
as opposed to joining a community I like
it this must exist right there's got to
be people out there may maybe the play
is to find the WhatsApp the Discord the

[20:01]
is to find the WhatsApp the Discord the
Facebook groups the Twitter groups that
are already doing this to aggregate them
into one like the community of all
communities because it's it's got to be
happening right we really haven't spent
any time looking to basically be a
secret shopper in each of these
communities and to use an API to just
push all the messages into one place and
then instead of it being act an actual
Community it could just be like a SAS
product 10 20 bucks a month where you
just get a feed of what all these people
are saying
or you could curate it and pay a little
bit to people who are already
known not influencers but people who
like see viral Trends early and they
submit the viral Trend to the group
right so it's almost crowdsourced in a
sense it's not just oh we own the
community and we are going to send you
the stuff that's going viral but the
community itself is also sending things
that they're finding that potentially
could be viral that would be hard
because then it's like quality control
and like how do you make sure it's not
too spammy CU like how are you supposed
to keep track of all these things that

[21:00]
to keep track of all these things that
could go viral but yeah that could be a
way as well to to get viral content I
think you're spot on with the
non-scalable human aspect of this
because I've looked for tools that do
this and I've paid for some and I always
churned a month or two later because
they don't work or they don't work well
like even that break the web app you
pull it up and it's like Paris Olympics
Paris Olympics gymnastics it's like I
know that's trending but that's not what
I'm looking for like I want to find the
to a girl right like I want to find
something that's Niche and trending edit
that out
M no so I think there's something to
that because I've been looking for that
and I haven't found it there are
companies you go Google it and they like
SAS products they claim to do this and
it's just not what we're looking for
like you did something similar to this
seven years ago when you built the agor
rithm when you partnered with McAfee
right like you were essentially
predicting where the coin was going to
move based on social sent
that you were mining from Reddit that

[22:01]
that you were mining from Reddit that
was Bas maybe Reddit and Discord I can't
remember all the groups so it's like if
you were doing that 7 years ago there
has to be something with AI
agents that could be crawling the web
and finding this stuff like it isn't
necessarily even have to be all human in
its input but anyways I think why the
human aspect is important is because
everyone's on social media many people
are on multiple platforms but everyone
has their one favorite
right that they just know inside and out
especially if they're creating on that
platform Twitter for instance if you and
I see a tweet Pop Up by Isaac French and
we see in the first hour it has 300,000
views to 99% of people that means
nothing to us that's like holy crap this
is g to get 20 million views right and
they do we just know what to look for
because we're addicted and we're
degenerates right and our wives present
us silently and our children don't we
are like we would be great I just heard

[23:01]
that we would be great candidates to
contribute to a community like this
because we know what to look for right
right and like of of course you could
find software that could say you know an
if then simple formula where if 100,000
views in the first hour push it forward
but I'm not seeing anything that's doing
that you know what you know what would
be really interesting
like what if there was like a social
credit ranking system
where Chris submits
something and you know it's at whatever
100,000 views but it goes to 10 million
and it's like okay Chris gets X number
of points because that was a successful
early viral post but then you submit
something the next day and it's like you
submitted it and it was at 10,000 views
and it goes to 50,000 it's like that
wasn't viral so some type of a mechanism
to be like here are the best individual
predictors of
virality MH so when they like when Chris
posts something oh shoot I'm gonna go

[24:01]
posts something oh shoot I'm gonna go
like take a look at that more weight as
a sign to it yeah maybe yeah I think you
could even get very creative with this
and if this actually became a real
business the people that submit the
stuff that ends up being the most
accurate they could actually get equity
in the product in the community in
whatever it's like rebuilding Reddit
you're you're building a social credit
system getting people to up vote down V
yeah yeah interesting can I take that
idea and it add to an idea that I
already had that's very similar okay
okay so there's this guy on Instagram
Mick I think he's European maybe Serbian
mik dozon Mick Xenon okay and he has 2.1
million followers and all he does is
post these viral viral viral videos of
dumb stupid products from like Alibaba
and AliExpress okay these videos get
tens of millions of
I don't know if he's filming them if he

[25:00]
I don't know if he's filming them if he
has a studio if these Chinese companies
know him because he's so popular and so
they send him stuff and then he has a
little home studio where he films the
the usage of these dumb products or if
the company itself is giving him the
videos I I think he's filming them
because they all have a similar theme to
them they all look about the same for
instance handsfree canopy 17 million
views some of them only get a few
hundred thousand or a floating cooler
right a floating cooler like for your
pool or for the like Yeah okay or let's
see a shoe and boot removal tool stuff
that like if it showed up at my house I
would look at my wife and be like what
are we spending money on this is so dumb
like you wouldn't be
surprised right and' be like you bought
this again you bought a back scratcher
again we have 17 of them this so an
instant trailer lift product that's like
41 million views and it's relevant
because I have a lawn mower a riding
mower now and to lift that thing up and
the lifts are like $300 and I Amin about

[26:01]
the lifts are like $300 and I Amin about
to spend that right but this plastic
thing is like 20 bucks and it
accomplishes the same purpose so here's
the idea okay okay I say you literally
take these products you find the ones
that are the most popular based on how
many views or how many comments they
getting and you build a Brookstone of
the 21st century you know what
Brookstone is yeah of course stupid
stores in the mall yeah describe it
though yeah it's a store in the mall
that basically sells all kinds of dumb
products like these that are like very
viral very visual they sell really well
now you could say well let's make an
e-commerce store and just do the same
thing people are doing that that's
played out that's really hard because
you got to use Facebook ads I think this
needs to be an in-person business where
you stock your store with 20 to 30
products it's very small footprint less
than a th000 square feet and but you
just have these products that you know
people love and they're Visual and you
could have a screen out front of the
store like it could be a store in the
mall right yeah and the screen is just

[27:02]
mall right yeah and the screen is just
showing Loops of these products and the
margins are stupid just stupid margins
and it's just like it's the new brook
stump what do you think I really like
that
idea like I really kind of surprised by
that well because we know there's a
market for it right and people want to
go and see and test these products out
like remember going to Brookstone I was
like I want to sit in the chair that
massages and I want to play with the
helicopter that also functions as a
pizza oven and they're just like r crap
that and they're impulse buys they're
total the mall is perfect for they're
total impulse buys do you know what a
popup shop is MHM okay I've heard of
them but I don't know how they actually
work yeah so do you know yeah tell me
okay for instance we went as a family to
a popup candy Museum in Dallas a year
ago and it was next to a foga dacha
restaurant and they're typically put in
like high income High traffic outdoor
retail areas that are that already do

[28:01]
retail areas that are that already do
really really well they're put in spaces
that are currently vacant but probably
won't be vacant for long so they're able
to sign short-term or month-to-month
leases they pay a little more but they
don't have to lock in and you can
introduce a concept that might be
temporary like by Design like a a candy
Museum or an ice cream Museum or you
could just be testing the concept and
then once it works you say okay we'll
sign a 10year lease please we this is
good so like I don't think you could
have described it any better to fit like
this like this would seem like the
perfect pop-up shop it would be right
like it would be what's the capex you
need shelving a desk shelving like a
couple of products that you buy from
Alibaba so people I like this idea this
is a good idea isn't it I know it's a
freaking great idea I like to say yeah
like there's a place go ahead it's an
Impulse buy and this goes against the
impulse buy like you wouldn't
necessarily have to carry a bunch of
inventory if if it's the Amazon
delivered same day type of business they
go they see it they test it out make a

[29:00]
go they see it they test it out make a
purchase and it's like delivered to
their house by the time that they get
home which true really cool so like you
probably need to do it in one of the
bigger markets first to test it in
Dallas or LA or new like whatever one of
those markets actually have a bunch of
fulfillment centers from a company like
Amazon but you could just name it the
viral pop-up shop and it's just like
every viral thing that you've seen is at
that shop and you can just go play
around with it the viral store the viral
store it could be a mall kiosk it could
be a mall cart those are month-to month
it could be like there's a shopping
center in Plano called Legacy West and
there's a Tesla store there's an Apple
Store there's a pelaton store pelaton
stores are not doing well they're
closing them left and right I can see it
working perfectly in the repurposed
pelaton store because they're like 800
square feet and if it doesn't go well
you could bounce in one to three months
and I like the idea of not carrying any
inventory because if like you're a
Brookstone you got to carry the
inventory there they buying it at the
point of sale and then they're walking
out with it if you could do it in a way
where you don't have to carry the
inventory costs people can come and just
play with whatever the samples and then

[30:02]
play with whatever the samples and then
they order it and hopefully within a day
it gets to their house it's achieving
the
same almost the same right there is some
trade-off right because you some people
do want it right away and maybe you lose
some of those but I think you'd more
than make up for it in the fact that you
don't have to outlay all this Capital to
buy a bunch of inventory to have on hand
in order for the store to be successful
you could just have it and like people
could literally just they come to you
and they're like hey I want to buy this
okay cool here's the the QR code like
you don't even need to set up a payment
processing system just have it processed
through Amazon with the with a s seller
that you have an agreement
with to me what the unknown that with
that model is once you tell them you're
going to ship it how many back out is it
one in 100 is it 10 out of 100 because
some people might want it right then I
agree that that's why I'm saying the
trade-off would be then you don't have
to carry the inventory that's the
downside of the other model that's true
is you have significant inventory
carrying cost
especially if you're a pop-up shop you

[31:00]
especially if you're a pop-up shop you
might not have much room in the back
right or you're just like I want to test
this for six months anyways or even one
month I don't want to spend $200,000 on
inventory so in my mind the pop-up would
be the perfect test model and then you
can track like okay yep 10% of people
back out because I tell them they're not
going to get it same day cool now you
have like just more data if you actually
wanted to open up a a store that offered
that stuff and you know what's crazy to
me this guy behind the Instagram account
he do doesn't have an e-commerce store
he makes money he probably makes a lot
of money from affiliate links because
that's his it is a business he has like
an Amazon storefront but I feel like you
could make a lot more if you had a
Shopify site that just where everything
was drop shipped on the back end I
wonder if you could make a deal where
you build that you put all of his
products on there and just say hey link
here instead and I'll just give you a
cut of everything it would have to be
more than the affiliate link but that
would be you know what that's like a
really interesting business model to
think about everybody's talking about oh
malls are dying people aren't renewing

[32:00]
malls are dying people aren't renewing
their leases and there's all this empty
space What do we do with this empty
space what if the empty space just
became
showrooms cool no no inventory carrying
costs you want to go check out the
latest golf equipment cool here it is go
check it out right and that online
seller leases these spaces for probably
well below Market but you can go and
check out the golf clubs or oh you want
to go and check out other sports things
pingpong paddles pickle ball paddles
cool
here's the pickle ball place it's still
in the mall like you're still going to a
centralized place the economics for the
mall obviously change you're probably
having to charge a lot lower rent but
people want to they want to feel stuff
they want to test it out they want to
see how it
works and then that would eliminate a
lot of the overhead and inventory
carrying costs that companies would have
that they typically have in the mall
because I mean there dude there's so
much think about how much inventory is
tied up in a Foot Locker in the Mall
like so much that they've got stashed on
that story that you don't need you don't

[33:00]
that story that you don't need you don't
need all that space
inventory I like that I had a cool idea
dude while we're on the subject of
Instagram I found this interesting
Instagram account called clean girl
while you're looking for that on the
subject of Instagram do all of your
Instagram like reals are they all just
like half naked girls working out in the
gym you already made this joke you
already made a joke dang
it okay so there's this girl on
Instagram called clean girl and she has
this foaming spray that's bright pink
and her videos are in front of a dirty
gravestone in the cemetery or something
dirty and she's like hey watch me clean
this gravestone and she's grown millions
of followers yes and I feel like she
could be like an industry plant because
she's selling this cleaning solution now
and it's not even ready yet goclean
girl.com and I feel like the there's
some guy in San Francisco that had this

[34:00]
some guy in San Francisco that had this
idea that's like all right let's take a
generic cleaning product let's white
label it let's put a really attractive
packaging on it let's go find someone
that's already on Instagram and let we
know that the before and after videos
sell really well we know that the
pressure washing videos sell really well
we'll take all of these innate Concepts
that just go viral cute girl before and
after a progress video of something
getting cleaned and we'll tie it to a
product that's very generic but looks
really special something that's already
made we don't have to develop it we'll
put it on a landing page and we'll sell
a ton of them I don't even think that's
like a theory I think that's absolutely
what the what some of these people do
cuz like on the surface this girl was
just has an Instagram account and she
just cleans stuff and she's like I want
to monetize so I should get this product
develop developed and sell it on my
website I think that's the story right
yeah if I was a big corporate company
and I had $10 million in my annual ad
budget obviously I'm going to go
traditional routes I'm going to go
television radio internet payperclick

[35:02]
television radio internet payperclick
SEO Etc but of course I'm going to start
allocating a part of my budget to
creating in-house content with
influencers and if it's like if it's
Proctor and Gamble you you can't do that
with a proctor and gambled new cleaning
solution like yeah the I think the only
not the only but a big potential I don't
even know what the right word is you
have to disclose if you're selling
something
if it were a big company you you would
see more hints you're saying you'd have
to disclose but I could see these
companies being like we're not selling
anything yet we're just going to pay for
you to develop this Instagram account oh
you want to take a trip to Bali here you
go oh and you want to like it's an
investment in that person or that brand
that they're helping to develop over
time but you know when Papa Warbucks
comes calling they're like all right
it's time to monetize sure they'll say
paid promotion by by Proctor and Gamble
but it doesn't necessarily mean that

[36:00]
but it doesn't necessarily mean that
everything else before that and them
helping to create the
account has to be paid promotion why
wouldn't they do that I don't like that
would be actually a really good idea we
also have to assume that someone like
Proctor and Gamble is creative and
they're they're like growth hacking like
this which that doesn't sound like
Proctor and Gamble so I think it's more
likely that it's just like some 34y old
in San Francisco with a good idea or
like a tech startup like I could see
someone have a thesis they're like I'm
going to buy a bunch of micro
influencers Brands and then turn that
into a marketing agency because I have
distribution I could see that yeah it's
just it's this is so smart and it goes
to what we talked about a couple months
ago on this podcast where like starting
a home service business it's very visual
right like mowing lawns like pressure
washing and then selling something
around that that's exactly what they're
doing here totally I wonder how else you
could do that it's just so smart like
the on the surface it's like I'm going
to go find an influencer and have them
promote my product okay cool everyone's

[37:00]
promote my product okay cool everyone's
doing that or I'm going to go find an
influencer that's not very big a micro
influencer and you say hey keep building
your account we're not going to touch
your account we want you to be the face
of this new account this new genre new
Niche we already know you're good we've
seen all your stuff but we want you to
sell XY or Z product through this new
account we'll give you 49% of the whole
business and you can be an owner of
something and not just do sponsored
reals all day that would be actually
really smart of them it takes away the
leverage of that Creator a year from now
when they come to negotiate with the
brand right because a year from now when
they come to negotiate with the brand
they've got the audience and they're
like all right well this is my price
take it or leave it but if the brand is
investing upfront and is like Hey we're
gonna give you $50,000 this year and
this year you're going to be a
consultant for us but it's to grow your
account and a year from now we're going
to launch a product we don't know what
it is yet we're going to see what works
but a year from now you're going to
launch a product and you're going to get
15% of that business oh my gosh are you
serious you're giving me $50,000 now and
I'm going to get 15% yeah you're going
to get 15% if it works out it's a

[38:01]
to get 15% if it works out it's a
no-brainer right because they just don't
know any better right and also to be
fair they're going to have to spend the
$50,000 in order to grow so like the
brand is really investing in this person
being successful that could be like a
search fund
model why AR there like influencer
Searcher search fund models where you
just that's your thesis I'm going to
raise a million dollar and I'm going to
find 20 influencers and I'm going to
give each influencer
$50,000 and they're going to spend the
next year like it's a venture BET right
they're going to spend the next year
growing their accounts and they have a
contract with us that we decide how they
monetize their account and so in a year
from now when they've gotten to X number
of followers we're gonna figure out the
monetization model and this is the
payback so that's being done at a later
stage Kevin ispir to the the plant Daddy
yeah Kevin aspu has the Epic gardening
YouTube channel it's multiple channels
he's doing eight figures in Revenue Vue
as far as YouTube creators go that's a
big business churnin invested like 17.5

[39:02]
big business churnin invested like 17.5
million do in him in anything he does
right so if you want to go buy a
Botanical Seed Company we're gonna own
20% of that you want to go buy this
company we're goingon to 20% that
YouTube ad Revenue we're gonna 20% of
that so there's chernin is like one of
three to five companies doing this what
you're talking about but maybe what
you're talking about is just doing this
earlier because churnin is making the
bet on a somewhat known entity whereas
yep it's almost more of a private Equity
model as opposed to to a venture model
whereas what I'm talking about is you
find people who are like sub 10,000
right and just fit the profile and it'
have to be somebody who actually knows
and has an eye for talent and then
invest in multiple of those because it
is going to be like a venture fund
probably eight of them are not going to
hit but two of them are just gonna Crush
of the girl who was having like hair
loss issues and her whole Instagram
account was centered around the hair
loss issues she was on MFM I think they
interviewed her I don't remember her
name but she started a business selling
this hair loss cream or hair thinning

[40:01]
this hair loss cream or hair thinning
cream or something and she hit eight
figures in 3 months it's insane because
she had perfect product audience fit
like 80% of the people that followed her
were like struggling with the same hair
loss issues as her and watching her
struggle through it and find these home
remedies so when she launched it was
huge from day one so to reverse that if
I'm developing some product similar to
that maybe it's like an acutane
competitor right me I'm going to go find
people like her that are talking about
that but would never launch an Accutane
competitor just not on their radar and
loop them in give them some equity and
say hey go listen to this podcast of
this girl that did this with her hair we
want to do that with you but we'll do
all the manufacturing we'll invest
millions of dollars you're going to get
10% Equity you're going to be the face
of it okay what' you think next Friday
we'll see you for the next hold C Bros
have a good week
