my friend Isaac and his dad found this
disgusting abandoned train car in a barn
that was collapsing it's 120 years old
and they renovated it to look like this
and today they charge $350 per night for
people to stay in it and it's fully
booked here's exactly how they did it so
4 years ago during covid they came
across this in a barn and the farm owner
sold it to them for only $2,000 it had
20 Stray Cats inside of it they had to
pay 10 grand to get the thing out of
there cuz it was up in the mountains on
these windy roads and and then they
spent 5 months and
$140,000 renovating the thing today it's
beautiful they've since added a caboose
it's fully booked on Airbnb and these
guys make 120 Grand per year on this one
unit it just goes to show that you can
see opportunity in everything
