thank you for joining episode nine of
the ker office I'm having a lot of fun
today was great I think you'll like it
we had four callers and then four
presubmit questions and you may notice
my voice sounds buttery silky smooth
much like you're listening to NPR talk
about uh tribal Heritage on the tundra
or something really weird like they talk
about but I'm proud of this microphone
and I'll stand by that so here's how
everything went today we had a guy ask
about his supplement business in
Oklahoma and Texas he has two retail
stores and he is struggling with racism
it's actually hurting his business next
person uh wants to start a trailer
business with his sons next person has a
dad business he encourages dads to cook
but he just got laid off and so he's
wondering is this ever going to make any
money should I buy a business what
should I do here fourth person has a
sales aai chatbot that he wants to sell
to storage businesses of all things and
then we had four presubmit questions the
first one

[01:00]
first one
asked about how to buy a home in a very
small community that never has homes for
sale next one asked about filing a new
entity third person asked about a stone
quarry that wants to that should be
repurposed as a different type of stone
quarry that would be more profitable
that was interesting and the fourth
person asked me if the vending machine
business is oversaturated and I went on
somewhat of a rant which was kind of fun
but unusual so I hope you enjoy today's
episode and I hope you join me next week
for for episode 10 anyway enjoy the
[Music]

you're just joining us for the first
time this is where you call in and ask
your business questions maybe it's a
failing business maybe you're crushing
it maybe you have a bad partnership or a
good partnership or you want to quit
your job I don't know ask me anything

[02:00]
your job I don't know ask me anything
let let's see how this goes so I am
going to let in our first guest and he
is
anonymous but I think I'm about to let
in this specific person so let's see how
this goes hello how are you good how are
you I'm good man thanks absolutely so
you are the one asking about a
supplement business is that right yes
correct yeah okay let's hear it man so
uh we have uh two locations I'm in North
Texas and Southern Oklahoma and I've
been in business in Texas for 10 years
and Oklahoma for five years the first
few years growing the business
everything went according to plan things
were going great Co hit and Co actually
skyrocketed our business we had more
people than ever wanting to be healthier
taking care of their Health Fitness
stuff like that now real quick why don't
you why don't you back up and just tell
us about what your business is what you
do what you sell yeah so we're uh retail

[03:01]
do what you sell yeah so we're uh retail
stores and we do any kind of workout
supplements vitamins like proteins
pre-workouts stuff like that all sorts
of pre-made meals healthy snacks and
then inside both locations we have a
full Smoothie Bar as well okay so you're
selling uh other company supplements not
your own in these correct yeah yeah okay
okay so a Supplements store SL Smoothie
Bar two locations one in north Texas one
in southern Oklahoma yes what are the
populations of the towns that these are
in and what are their locations like
within those
towns uh so they're uh both going to be
right around the the town and
surrounding areas about 30,000 people
okay and uh are you asking for the
location specifically no is it on a busy
road yeah the first location we are
right on the main Highway pretty prime
location couldn't ask for really a
better spot the second location is in a
a newer up and coming spot the last

[04:01]
a newer up and coming spot the last
probably two or three years a lot of
businesses a lot of new developments
have come to that area a lot of older
businesses from the same city have
relocated to this part of town and in
that one that Oklahoma location I'm in a
shopping center with about uh 15 16
other businesses there okay just like a
normal outdoor strip mall correct okay I
actually pulled up your locations here
so without revealing you I'm looking at
where you are okay so sorry let's back
back up you were saying you what year
did you open so Texas opened up in
2014 okay and then uh Oklahoma was
2019 and you said Co skyrocketed your
business yeah it was crazy man we about
doubled a little more than doubled our
normal foot traffic everything was great
absolutely just like I said Co affected
a lot of people in a lot of different
ways and we were one of the businesses
that really benefited from it okay what
made you want to open that second store

[05:00]
made you want to open that second store
5 years in honestly man it's the
locations are about 40 mil apart and as
far as direct competition from the
original location there was nothing even
remotely close and I had a very regular
crowd from the city up in Oklahoma that
came down about once a month as a big
group and spent a good amount of money
with us and that was one of the the main
complaints was from people of that area
is that they wished we were a little bit
Clos closer so we went looking around
and and it took about 8 months almost a
year of looking before we finally
decided to go ahead and finalize on that
spot or that location but that was the
main reason I wanted to open up a second
location after about 5 Years anyway that
was in the original plan and we had such
a good consistent following from that
Oklahoma region that's why we selected
that location which stores doing better
and what are their sales numbers each so
as of right so as a whole so the Texas

[06:01]
as of right so as a whole so the Texas
location definitely does better and then
as a whole we do on the month the Texas
location does about 30k a month and the
Oklahoma location is floats around that
18 to 21 a month okay what are your net
what's your profit like we glow gross
month after month we stay between 25 and
30% gross or or margins sorry gross
margins yeah what are your net profits
like so we're in Texas we stay around
seven to 8K a month and then Oklahoma is
going to be honestly closer to that 3K
Mark okay how many years left do you
have on each lease Texas is now in a
month-to-month and Oklahoma has the last
part of a year I think there's six
months left on it okay and what are your
sales like today compared to at their
Peak during Co significantly

[07:02]
Peak during Co significantly
slower were what were they during covid
per month at at their Peak so the Texas
location we were 55 minimum we were
pushing close to 60k a month in the
Texas location and then we were floating
around that 30k in the Oklahoma location
okay all right so Oklahoma's always been
2/3 to half as big and that it stayed
steady during Co they each got about
twice as big correct okay now what are
you struggling with what was last year
like when did you start to see sales dip
are they flat today or are they still
dropping what's going on yeah and I
guess that's my scenario I I'll lay it
out for you and this is where I wanted
to hear your thoughts after covid
literally following the covid trend as
The Fad or the worry of covid went away
sales dipped a little bit with that kind
of followed that Trend and then one of
the biggest issues that having is over

[08:01]
the biggest issues that having is over
the last about year or so so the towns
both of the Cities I'm in I would say
are very
political and so something I've had
issues with over the last year is I
found out from very close friends of
mine that there were uh groups of people
so I I'm originally born I'm from Texas
born and raised here I've been here my
whole life my father was originally
Middle Eastern and so myself and all my
siblings we have like traditional Middle
Eastern
names and about a year ago I started
dealing with a big group of individuals
who were spreading a lot of negativity
about me and my businesses and they were
pushing this huge campaign about how we
don't support middle
easterners and that was a big hit when
when I started hearing stuff like that I
I've noticed that traffic has gone down

[09:00]
I've noticed that traffic has gone down
and in our locations we do have a
standard free and a paid like Platinum
like a membership program that we offer
and with that a lot of the people that I
had heard were spreading or talking
about those rumors about not wanting to
support me because of my background I
actually saw a lot of those people who
were involved in that completely either
deleting accounts or unenrolling from
our membership account stuff like that
and and that's been something I've
really struggled with let me make sure I
understand this correctly you are Middle
Eastern
correct yeah so my father's side is
Middle Eastern my mother's originally
from the states I was born and raised
here in Texas I just I literally just
have a middle eastern descent name yeah
your name okay now is it other Middle
Easterns that are saying this about you
that you don't support middle easterners
or no so it it's the local people a
group of local people saying that they
refused to support middle easterners
okay being racist absolutely okay and

[10:03]
okay being racist absolutely okay and
what triggered this was it co was it
something unrelated to co now it all
really started when all the the most
recent like political type stuff with
all the war and all that stuff started
happening that's when it started and
it's just stemmed from that I believe
would you say that like what is the
racial makeup of your the majority of
your customer base or is there none is
it representative of the town it it's
very white very Caucasian very
Republican so representative of the
towns where you are yes yes okay where's
this talk happening is it on Facebook is
it like what is the medium for this
racis so everything that I I've heard
like from mouths of other people has
been spread in two places and one of
them was one of our local gyms and then
one of them was in a business that one
of those people who did not want to
support me owned okay

[11:00]
support me owned okay
man first of all I'm sorry this that's I
can see why you want to stay Anonymous I
I didn't expect that coming on this call
uh threw me for a curveball there but
yeah that's that's tough man I apologize
that's happening especially minutes from
where I live yeah has it been was it all
at once or is it slowly started
affecting your sales
numbers yeah it was a I would say a
slower Pace it happened I started
noticing like the the negative talk and
the loss of Select customers and their
friends and followers over the course of
probably I'd say four months five months
maybe and then it's just been stagnant
since then the last five or six months
have been stagnant since then so I guess
if if it helps you any so I guess what
I'm looking for is your thoughts or your
recommendations on not maybe not
necessarily dealing with that issue but
trying to in a smaller town like this
where that is some hearsay that's going
on just trying to generate more sales
more traffic trying to get more foot

[12:01]
more traffic trying to get more foot
traffic in yeah what do you want to do
if we were to never talk three four six
months from now where do you find
yourself realistically speaking are you
thinking of closing or you know in in
six months from now no not now or not
from any of that in the near future six
months ideally still where I am now just
building out and growing the businesses
my original plans were to have two or
three locations and then
I wanted to figure out what my last
calling what my final calling whatever
you want to call it is and my original
plans back when I opened everything up
where I wanted to be out of retail I
wanted to be doing something else I
wanted to exit retail whether it was
close sell whatever it is I wanted to be
out of retail by the time I was
35 so that gives us about two years have
you thought of opening different
locations in in a different city Al
together you know completely different
city or in the same city in a different

[13:01]
city or in the same city in a different
location a different city third
store I I have thought about it yeah
it's I would say the biggest hindrance
is just right now with everything that's
been going on in recent times with the
decline of sales it it just I guess to
be honest scares me yeah finding other
people are more helped to to staff the
stores and me go off and do a third
location has there been new competitors
open up these last 5 years do you
compete directly with GNC not at all no
I'm I'm still in in Oklahoma there is a
GNC relatively close by but it's very
poorly staffed they have horrible
operating hours they're literally only
open when there's somebody available
they're in a not that great part of town
as far as like location is considered
and they were there before I opened up
since I've opened up both locations
there has not been any direct
competition that's opened up within okay
30 miles or so okay
have you reached out to any local media

[14:02]
have you reached out to any local media
or news about any of this I have not
I've toyed with the idea but I didn't
know which direction that would take it
I didn't know if it would help things or
if it would make things worse why don't
you test that at your smaller store in
Oklahoma why don't you test reaching out
to just the local news and just telling
them your story exactly as you're
telling me and trying to get someone on
your side I would even go so far as to
do some background research on the
person that you'll be reaching out to
and try to find someone that seems like
they'd be more sympathetic to your cause
cuz obviously you're going to fight up
against that too right like the person
the people you reach out to might be
just as racist as everyone else right I
would try to reach out to people that at
least appear to be more sympathetic to
your cause and I would just fight back
in public if you have a month-to-month
lease and you're concerned about the
viability of your business or at least
one of your stores what do you have to
lose yeah if the the town in Oklahoma is

[15:00]
lose yeah if the the town in Oklahoma is
just tainted permanently and it's okay
either I close this or I just move this
to a completely different Metroplex
altogether and just hope that this
doesn't happen again or I just fight
back I just punch back and see what
happens and worst case my sales drop
more month-to Monon lease whatever I get
out best case the community rallies
around me and says hey I'm not racist
I'm not racist I'm not RAC they all
raise their hand and say I'm sorry
that's happening to you on behalf of the
town that is a minority of us that is
acting that way and we support you the
majority supports you I could see some
sort of a ground swell happening if you
were to do that but people need to know
about it and worst case you're in the
same spot you are now maybe sales are a
little lower and you just pack up and
move
home say but what do you think about
that is that viable yeah I think like
the plan as a whole is very viable and
if it was like to come down to something
happening to one of the locations or

[16:00]
happening to one of the locations or
whatever it is I don't think that
negatively affects me or impacts me I
don't have any negative feelings towards
it like I said originally the plan was
to exit these businesses at some point
anyway no I I I don't I see it being a
very viable option and I don't have any
negative feedback or connotation towards
it yeah I would even make a video you
could write something but I would make a
video of you standing in front of your
store just pleading your case and even
be specific about your sales numbers hey
there's been no new competitors in this
area people are only working out even
more I don't like help me out here
what's going on yeah and you're going to
get some haters obviously but those
haters will just help spread the message
even further right right nothing goes
viral without haters period yeah that's
true and this is actually more likely to
go viral than a more vanilla message if
you will
okay so that's what I would do but I
apologize that's happening either way
that's it's it's tough to have forces

[17:00]
that's it's it's tough to have forces
like that um going against you that
aren't normal right that shouldn't be
there
yeah no I appreciate it absolutely and I
wish you the best and let me know how it
turns out either way I will I'll keep
you posted thanks so much for your time
Chris yep no problem we'll see you later
bye bye Brandon yes sir how are
you I'm good I am pulling up your info
now and it looks like I have two words
trailer business I want to hear about
your trailer business basically I my
intention is to copy yours and uh set it
up in a way I have five grown children
four or two boys that live outside of my
town in Corpus Christi so my thought was
how could I set it up in a way where I
get to buy the trailer on my credit them
run it where they are pay me back for
the trailer but then eventually build
their business up to where they can buy
their own trailers and

[18:00]
their own trailers and
expand okay so let's back up what type
of trailer
specifically those dump
trailers okay so you're looking to start
a hauling business with a dump trailer
with your
sons for by the day or the
week gotcha okay and you're willing to
pay for the trailer but you want to
structure it right with them so you get
paid back is that right do you want
equity in the actual business or just to
get your money back my thought would be
basically by one trailer pay me back the
cost of the trailer and then I get a
percentage every
month just like a royalty for having
lengthen the money yeah like for general
terms $100 a trailer for 10 years or
whatever it is okay now what do these
trailers cost and how many do you plan
to buy they're about 10 grand each
depending on your discount and I would
like to buy about three each to get them

[19:01]
like to buy about three each to get them
started okay and how many of your boys
are going to be in this business again
two
initially okay and do you have a plan
for marketing these or for actually
collecting revenue is there some sort of
a channel that you already have in place
is there a Marketplace that you're going
to list these for rent on or what is the
plan to rent them basically do the rent
me stickers on the back do Facebook
Marketplace and then both these two
particular signs have a number of
connections with home builders
construction and fence building firms in
those particular areas around the Hill
Country of Texas okay are they what
what's the personality type of your sons
are they sales guys introverts
extroverts hard workers sales guy and
the other one is very knowledgeable
about the construction and stuff like
that so he's a little bit more an
introvert the other one's more of an

[20:01]
introvert the other one's more of an
sales guy go out
there okay what will they be charging
for these what's an average job what
they're finding in their particular area
is most of them are going for about $150
to $200 a day my thought to get started
is $100 a day to build that kind of
reputation and then do some sort of
multi-day
discount have they have they been in
business before no what about you
yes I've started a number of businesses
over my lifetime and I've always been
the guy in the back where you do most of
the work but I fund it and then you buy
me out
essentially okay which is fine between
two people like you and I because I can
yell at you I can call you names and
your mom's not going to get mad at me
but when we're dealing with my direct
Sons there's another person involved mom
makes me be nice to them but I also want
it to be very clear and legal so there's
not disputes later on either sure okay

[21:03]
not disputes later on either sure okay
so I would start like before you do
anything I would have your sons start
marketing these trailers before you buy
anything before you spend a dime all
those marketing channels that you talked
about except for of course putting a
sticker on the trailer because there is
no trailer yet get that going put up a
website use card C to put up a landing
page and see if you can draw some
interest first assuming you do now
they're going to they're going to
actually want to rent it and then just
tell them it's not ready yet it's not
available on that day whatever we're not
in business yet however much or a little
you're comfortable telling them assuming
you do see enough interest to Warrant
buying a trailer I would start with one
I know that's tricky because you can
only rent out one at a time but I think
it's I I think you just want to head
your bets here I think you'd rather have
one trailer that you have to unload at a
small loss than three if it doesn't if
there's a downturn in the economy or

[22:00]
there's a downturn in the economy or
downturn in local construction or
whatever I would hge your bets by just
buying one and I like your structure of
you know $100 per what what was your
structure again $100 per what for paying
you back $100 per day and then multi-day
discounts for the week no for the
structure for you getting compensated
for this oh basically the trailers's
10,000 my thought was probably do $1,000
or $500 a month until it's paid off and
then drop it to 250 a month for 10 years
or whatever just for it's like your
royalty or your equity in the business
without actually having equity in the
business what is the backup plan if they
stop paying you what is there recourse
you just say because it's family it's
weird have you thought about that yeah
basically that was my plan is to set up
essentially a small contract that said
these are the payments you have
obligated to and if you don't then I
will come repossess it and then use the

[23:02]
will come repossess it and then use the
Apple tags to make sure we can find it
at all times perfect yeah I would put
some flexibility in there in case they
have a slow season slow year slow month
but I think that's great just have a
very simple payback period I think
you're on the right track a smaller
dollar amount once it's paid off in
perpetuity maybe forever sounds too
scary or five or 10 years as you said so
the only real change I would make to
your plan is put more emphasis on the
marketing and less emphasis on the
structure you want to be sure that you
can actually rent these things out
because we hear things anecdotally all
the time or oh man I can't get a trailer
oh I should buy a trailer but that's not
enough research it's just not I would
start with one even if you can get
discounts for buying multiple start with
a website start with some marketing get
some bookings even if you're the booking
is for the next day and you're not going
to have the trailer for a month just
cancel it get their name and number call
them back in a month um and go that way
that's a great idea I I like that idea

[24:01]
that's a great idea I I like that idea
of just saying hey it's not available
for the weekend you wanted how about
this weekend and if I get enough then
hey let's go get one tomorrow and we'll
put it out there totally or you could
even rent a trailer to rent to them and
just break even or even lose a little
money that's true that's a good idea as
long as I'm charging them at least what
I'm paying or close to it there's not
much of a risk yeah we were looking at
the same thing in the pet cremation
business where we were going to buy this
$100,000 crematorium and then we
realized man all of our competitors are
they're only using this thing 10% of the
time we could just rent it from them
hourly and that's what we're doing
so that makes sense and then if it gets
to a point you can always buy it but for
right now if it goes away it's not that
big a deal that's right cover your
downside Brandon hope this
helps it does very much I appreciate it
I appreciate all your help absolutely
have a great uh weekend
you too take care all right bye David

[25:04]
you too take care all right bye David
hey Chris how are you good how are you
man good good welcome to the ker office
thank you very much so you were recently
laid off and you have a side hustle that
encourages dads to cook all right let's
hear about it yeah so it's a little bit
of a The Meta thing that's going on is
that there's a lot of options on the
table and like I've been looking at
maybe purchasing a business and I've
while I'm doing that maybe also looking
for jobs I'm also just try I'm got my
kind of like fingers on a lot of
different pies right now so part of this
is about focusing uh a bit and but I've
I keep finding myself drawn to this
thing that I'm building to help dads uh
cook for their families reclaim family
dinner make it less chaotic and whatnot
at a high level curious about your
thoughts on focus and then I think in as
I'm like balancing joy and energy and
Harmony fighting with this thing that
I'm doing it's been really fun I've done

[26:00]
I'm doing it's been really fun I've done
some cohort classes I've helped a bunch
of guys and now I have a community that
I'm I'm building up and have a
newsletter and all these different
things like how would I I'm looking for
kind of creative ways to maybe grow it
while I can maybe maintain or do these
other things or maybe just stop it all
you know what I mean and yeah just yeah
love love your love your thoughts here
so how many months left of Runway do you
have would you say probably have till
maybe till the end of the year I would
say probably like maybe five or whatever
that is I can't do the mental math right
now but yeah okay and how what is your
background if you were to have to go get
a job tomorrow what do you do so I've
started a couple few companies I've been
I've been Mo primarily in digital Health
I've been building products in the
digital Health space had one company I
started bootstrapped it did a few
million in Revenue had a team but after
that company I exited that company and
worked I'm I'm technically a product
manager manager so I work with my build
digital products

[27:01]
digital products
effectively okay how is your job market
today oh have you been looking you been
looking then yeah yeah it's a about
product managers are just being dumped
and laid off by the thousands at the
moment it's a really it's a bleak market
right now okay pretty High Cost of
Living where you are yeah I live in the
LA area so yes high cost yeah what is
your Mr on your cooking project today
oh it's at it's at zero right now it's
almost at zero yeah zero yeah I did a
little research I'll admit you've got a
a a free newsletter and then you have a
$20 month product is that right that's
right yeah so have you not sold any of
the $20 month products then I haven't
been marketing them I so I or when I
first started I was doing cohort classes
and I was like sharing that on LinkedIn
and getting people to join and I was
charging like 150 I origin started at 30
and then I bumped it to 75 and I was

[28:01]
and then I bumped it to 75 and I was
discounting it and the the total price
was 150 I wasn't getting much many
people after 75 bucks to like but yeah
I've decided to go to more like
recurring Revenue model lower price
doing less of the Intensive course and
just you know once a month cook along
and some meal plans and also just have a
a community to help support these guys
okay is there a precedent for a
competitor doing what you're doing and
doing well or or are you inventing this
model yeah there are people doing this
in the fitness space quite a bit
especially there's a guy that's doing
stuff in the kind of over 40 50 year old
like fitness men male fitness space and
doing quite well there's like various
people doing this in this space like
this okay what not for dad's cooking
specifically oh yeah not for there there
are there there's a couple of guys on
have a Facebook group but they don't
really have it's not like a very like
active there's like an also a retic
group called dat at Chefs as well that

[29:01]
group called dat at Chefs as well that
people so there's some but it's free
stuff going on do you have much
experience doing like paid ads for
digital products no I don't I'm learning
about it but I have no clue very much
about that okay now tell me about the
your interest to buy a business you said
you were looking at like a backfill
business what why do you have that
interest and what types of businesses
catch your eye when you're shopping on
is by sell like we all do yeah so the
one I was looking at is called backfat
Prevention Services I like this business
because it's it's mandatory in 30 states
to for commercial businesses to get this
like test so it's a really cheap quick
fast test that's done by for making sure
water doesn't go back into the main line
uh I like that business but I'm just
that's it excites me because it's like
they have businesses have to do this on
a regular basis commercial businesses
have to do this it's not high it's high
margin when it's not like a lot of the
tests are like you get certified 100

[30:02]
tests are like you get certified 100
bucks 120 bucks for the for that so I'm
looking at business I'm trying to I I'm
just tired of tech so I'm tired of that
Tech world and I'm trying to I grew up
in grocery stores and cafes and my
family had those they had a distribution
business and things like that so I all
in food and so I've just been I like the
tactic tactile like just using my hands
and I just like the Simplicity of those
businesses they're messy because of
employees
and obviously it's a very different type
of management than like managing as a
product manager with like designers and
engineers and things like that so
there's a little bit of a difference
there but yeah like I'm attracted to
that I'm attracted to taking back a
little bit of control of my career and
also just trying to find something with
like cash flow that is Cash flowing and
profitable and things like that so it
yeah how much money like free cash do
you have to invest in a
business so I was definitely going to be
considering my own cash some portion

[31:00]
considering my own cash some portion
debt with SBA loan or some sort of loan
as well as seller financing that would
be my kind of that would be a
combination Free Cash
Plus maybe like 100 Grand I would say
around 100 Grand so you could use that
or some of that to put down in addition
of seller financing Andor an SBA correct
yeah okay so here's my gut like from
everything you've told me you're laid
off a few months ago your job market is
really tough right now
you have experienced managing people is
that right yeah yeah definitely and
you're you feel comfortable with that
like you people like you like working
with people I love people no I'm not a
jerk no definitely not very
collaborative yeah nice I try to be I'm
fair and firm yeah okay I feel like the
time the phase of life that you're in
today is not the phase of life to chase
Your Passion right the the the dad's
that cook thing it sounds fun but it
just doesn't feel like you have that

[32:00]
just doesn't feel like you have that
luxury right now and you're doing it
because you want to be doing something
and you should be doing something and
good on you for doing something you're
not just sitting there watching Netflix
all day you're building and I commend
you for that but I don't see a path for
this side hustle being enough to cover
your monthly burden right in like the
foreseeable future yeah like I would
love it if you were to tell me man I
know this guy and this guy that are
doing this and this is their model and
they're making 70 grand a month 110
Grand a month 10 grand a month anything
where it could be like okay let's take
some of that market share or okay let's
go capture these dads that they're not
even looking at these guys are they're
only doing Instagram organic and they're
crushing it but no one's doing it on Tik
Tok okay let's talk about that I it just
scares me if you're inventing a model
and it scares me that you don't already
have an audience that you could push
this to the $19 a month scares me like
I've done a newsletter before that
scares me cuz it is just a slow linear
grind to get that to be 5 10 grand a

[33:02]
grind to get that to be 5 10 grand a
month even so I feel like you should
just keep doing that as your outlet but
not expecting to rely on that as being a
form of tangible income for you and not
continuing to work in that direction I
think if the job market is crap as I
believe you say it is I think you should
look seriously at buying a business
specifically something in a niche that
you have experienced with I wrote a
newsletter about this about a month ago
I have a five or six step scoring system
of if you should buy or build a business
and one of the scores is if you have a
lot of experience then you should be
more likely to buy that business because
in my opinion the risks are much higher
when you buy a business because you have
something to lose right yeah and so if
you are a product manager going to buy a
restaurant and you're obviously not
trying to do that that would be very
risky whereas if you're from the

[34:00]
risky whereas if you're from the
restaurant industry for 20 years that
would be less risky and so I would just
shop start shopping on bis byell despite
what people say about it oh there's no
good deals left on bis byell they've all
been picked through I don't agree with
that there's good deals on bis byell and
on Zillow and on kxy there's good deals
everywhere there's a lot of Tire kickers
and dreamers and guys that just play
business on bis byell and so if you want
to get uh a broker or an owner to answer
your call or email you've got to break
through the noise and get really
creative because they're sick of dealing
with all the tire kickers and I feel
like you're serious I would tell them
that you have cash you prefer seller
financing but you're also willing to do
SBA and I would find something that can
cover your monthly burn on day one with
a lot of upside right upside in my
opinion being they're not charging
enough or they don't even have a website
or they have a website but they're not
marketing at all or they're complacent

[35:01]
marketing at all or they're complacent
like in my opinion when it comes to
buying a boomer owned business that's
the biggest and easiest to find upside
or things like that going in getting SBA
qualified finding a really good SBA
lender being willing to put in some cash
hopefully the seller can hold a note and
find any Like Home
Service any kind of boring ugly business
that is netting at least six figures a
year I would put all of your energy and
focus into that and I think you'd find
something good you're in a city with 20
million people right there's got to be
something there's a few things here do
you so what I'm like at
a what like you're worry as well is I
don't have experience like you you've
written a lot about like tree tree
trimming and things like all those kind
of Home Service I've never done any of
that stuff before so it's not like I
like I I was thinking of backf I don't
have any experience in plumbing or
backflow I have to go get like test or
go get certified in that too but I'm

[36:00]
go get certified in that too but I'm
open to things like that I just I'm is
there do you I do have most of my
experience has been Healthcare so it's
like I know Healthcare very well and I
have credibility in in the especially in
the healthcare space I've been looking
like medical billing companies coding
companies things like that so I wonder
if that's a should I be looking in that
area or should I or really just doesn't
matter industry agnostic it doesn't I
should be looking
at there's do you follow my business
partner
Nick I'm not no I I don't unfortunately
sorry so he bought he lived in La he
bought a medical billing company in
Boise for a couple million sold it two
years later for five or six million wow
and didn't really do a ton and just he
didn't even operate it he had an
operator that he gave minority Equity to
and they just made some good efficient
changes the owner was great she stayed
on it was just a great outcome I
actually invested in that business
oh wow I like that idea medical billing

[37:01]
oh wow I like that idea medical billing
I learned a little bit about that
industry when I helped him sell it and I
learned There's an opportunity I don't
know how you feel about this but it is a
business strategy There's an opportunity
in medical billing today to buy a
medical billing company and to Outsource
the labor or to use AI to cut
cost yeah it's a huge thing people using
like India Philippines using folks like
that to to do that and AI is doing
fantastic too and I know a bunch of the
AI companies that are doing that so very
maybe I should just go down that is
there a great way like to find those
because I've had a lot of trouble
finding those businesses
like I would start calling them try to
hire a VA to find the owner's info a
skip Tracer and text call email them
find the ones that seem to have been
around for a while seem to be
undercharging seem to have outdated
websites and that's the nice thing about
looking for a business to buy that is
very Niche and specific is that you can

[38:02]
very Niche and specific is that you can
hone in on 10 of them right especially
if they're not listed and you can be
pretty sure that one or two of those 10
are at least going to be willing to sell
and then you got a grand price right and
then you got to get to the closing table
so maybe try 20 or 30 but still look on
Biz by cell there's stuff on there and I
wouldn't be completely afraid of Home
Services I would be afraid of more High
skill or more high-risk Industries
manufacturing restaurants but Home
Services you could find a hundred
different Home Service type businesses
that are not very high skill where you
could become experienced in a weekend of
YouTube videos yeah and that might make
you nervous but you could learn a lot
right and
binging i' I've I've learned quite a bit
doing YouTube so that's it's my it's my
my University now okay and what was skip
Tracer again what was that that's just
what they call someone who can find the
contact info really well or they have
tools at their disposal and on upwork

[39:00]
tools at their disposal and on upwork
there's thousands of people that call
themselves skip tracers which really
just means they have login info to tools
uh that okay make that available to I
didn't know that okay so I can have them
go find and should I be localized to
California or I guess your colleague was
in LA as well and found some place in
Boise so that's um if you're willing to
move I'm a huge proponent of looking for
the best deal anywhere and just moving
there um I'm a big proponent on if
you're Beggars can't be choosers and if
you find an amazing deal on the other
side of the country then move there for
it oh he moved I I didn't realize that
so oh that was the that was a key detail
all right so he moved to Boise that's he
did yeah and they were not they were
lifers they were SoCal lifers so it was
a big deal for them to move but they do
not regret it whatsoever yeah I can
imagine with that kind of outcome that's
huge okay and then you asked about
advertising and things like that for the
dad cooking thing is that something I
should should also be doing as I'm like

[40:02]
should should also be doing as I'm like
just filling the cut like feeding the
soul a bit I don't think so I don't
think so honestly because that's a whole
nut to crack and you're going to have to
put a a bunch of money into it just to
break even on ads like the play there is
to have some sort of a $49 course that
you sell that you can just break even on
with ads and then use those leads to
sell something more High ticket to them
that's the whole Russell Brunson
Playbook there but that's I wouldn't
split your time between the two I would
just keep your newsletter going stay in
the know keep that fire lit but not
really lean into trying to grow it
because this is looking for a business
to buy is at least one full-time job got
it okay this is super helpful yeah if
and if your colleague knows any anyone
in the anyone selling in the medical
billing space that' be i' love to I'll
have him reach out to you he'd be happy
to help yeah that'd be fantastic I
appreciate that absolutely thanks for
coming on thanks Chris have a good day
yep you too see you Patrick hey Chris

[41:02]
yep you too see you Patrick hey Chris
how are you good how are you man having
a good Friday so far good all I know
about you is sales
AI yeah so I'm a software engineer by
background and have been tinkering over
the past six months or so on an AI
product basically we have a way for
people to for us to build and train AI
models to do the sales process for for
business and originally we were going
after really white collar category and
there was going to be a lot of
Integrations and a lot of other things
and that that were really complex that
needed to be done before we would really
get product Market fit in the meantime I
had the opportunity to show this product
to someone that's more of in a blue
crawler product business and one $3
million a year sales category and it was
as if I had shown a caveman fire for the
first time he got really excited about
the product feels like there's a lot of
room to run uh so obviously it started

[42:00]
room to run uh so obviously it started
me thinking about what other categories
what other areas uh could I get into and
one of the things that I'm running into
is there are many businesses in that
space whether it's a product or service
business sub3 million maybe family run
type business where we could help do
some of their inbound sales
qualification but I'm suffering with
honestly too many options and not really
knowing where to start and and then B
like how do I contact these people
because they're not LinkedIn or Twitter
people by and large they're out in the
field doing their business actually
these in my experience these are the
easiest guys to to contact and I'll tell
you how but I first want to hear about
the guy you talked to with the when you
say $3 million is that the revenue of
his business or is that the potential
size of a customer he would be to you
yes so that's the re Topline revenue of
his business he's a dealer for in a
product category what industry tell me
everything you can about this guy yeah
it's he's in portable shed storage
industry has a lot of inbound for for

[43:02]
industry has a lot of inbound for for
for his customers for product features
will it fit will it be a good fit for my
property those kind of things and yeah
so he gets a lot of inbound some of it's
really low quality or not super
qualified and but at the same time he
may get two or three a week that are
ready to move to make a purchase you
know that day or or that week filtering
through those is a challenge for him
okay so by by nature of that business he
just has a ton of questions and probably
80% of them are the same right exactly
do you need to level this like how do
you bring it in how do you get access
what stuff like that and so he's
thinking if I can just upload my FAQs
basically this AI software can just chat
with my customers and save me a ton of
time exactly and we help them do that so
we import all that data and build a
model that's really customized for their
business and they don't have to do
anything other than start to to send
customers that way and connect to their
socials start Distributing those phone

[44:01]
socials start Distributing those phone
numbers Etc what would he be willing to
pay for something like this the next
best option for him would be hiring an
employee to do it presumably either
in-house or or some type of va that
would lend me to believe that there's a
fairly high dollar amount, doll or so a
month to be able to do that being that
we're we're software obviously we've got
uh pretty good margin so we could offer
really competitive rate relative to what
it would cost uh to hire a person to do
this even if they were
offshore would this software live on the
website is it it's just a chatbot
basically yeah so it's it's Omni channel
right so it's on the website it can
answer you know text messages and phone
calls as well as as well as Facebook
messages those kind of things okay here
so chatbots are crowded right and I'm
sure you know that right but I I think
what you have going for for you here is
the owners of these bluecar businesses
have never heard the word chatbot in

[45:01]
have never heard the word chatbot in
their life so it might as well not be
crowded if they don't know that it's
crowded or that chatbots are common
place they were Common Place long before
AI right I remember there was a there
was a whole chat B chatbot craze with
Facebook Messenger like in the 2018 2019
eras but what if you took this product
and made it sms-based like with twilly
up I it is already it is already okay
yes is that like the first case use for
it or is that one of the uses for it
that's one of the uses so you can you
can call it you can text it you can chat
with it through Facebook Market or
Facebook Messenger Etc as well as chat
with it through the website so basically
any channel that you're pushing traffic
to or getting leads from with the
notable exception of if you have a
storefront that you walk
into how would you prefer to charge for
this what's Your Gut if you were to
charge how to charge for it today what
would you put up on the website yeah I

[46:00]
would you put up on the website yeah I
think I would probably charge in that $6
$700 a month recurring monthly recurring
category and do you think people would
pay
that based upon the feedback of one he
seemed really interested in doing that
and in fact is traveling it right now to
see if it's good fit for his business as
we go out of people that I've that are
in my circle maybe there's a little less
dollar amount to be had but yeah it's
funny because
the same demographic these business
owners these Boomer business owners
they're the first to say keep jobs in
America don't Outsource jobs but the
second you pitch to them hey I could
replace your employee with a $500 a
month chatbot they're in they're so in
right yeah one of the things he
communicated with me was like getting
people of quality was really hard right
he's he's Middle America and getting
people that were really driven and
motivated to do a good job was difficult
for
even at a high rate so having the abild
is automated is awesome for him yeah

[47:03]
is automated is awesome for him yeah
okay so have you sold is this live do
you have a website ready to go is it
fully built out or you still in the
fully built out we we're still working
on some additional features and stuff
it's definitely something that could be
turned on live today is this gentleman
willing to start paying for it because
there's a difference between this is
amazing where has this been on my life
first take my money yeah had a
conversation about what price point we
feel like that's comfortable and he he
replied positively to that he didn't pop
out his credit card
but okay I if I were you I would start
with this guy charge him whatever
doesn't even matter and then craft your
landing page around his industry the
shed industry literally and then I would
scrape a list of all of the shed
businesses in America or in a state or
whatever and start texting them just
different approaches hey hon honestly
you could start by texting them a normal
question that a customer would ask right

[48:02]
question that a customer would ask right
just to get their attention Okay are
like are you open or are you open over
the weekend or do you have this model in
stock and then just start a conversation
of what you can do for them and I would
get on the phone with this guy and say
hey I'm going to give you half off but I
really want to pick your brain and know
like all of the pain points in your
business so you can start using those
pain points as part of your sales pitch
to these other business owners because
this
is when your total addressable Market is
so big you really have to start so Niche
like don't name this shed buus chatbot
domcom name it something generic so it
can be anything but Point all your
branding towards the shed industry and
just for a month just for a month just
see how it goes and are you able to
acquire I like to use the 1% rule
personally so if you have 10,000 shed
businesses and you all of them let's say

[49:01]
businesses and you all of them let's say
you have 10,000 shed businesses and all
of them see your outbound right they see
it it's an email or it's a voicemail or
it's a text and you can convert 100 of
them then to me that's a scalable
business and that sounds oh easy it's
not easy sometimes it's a tenth of a
percent and I would not try to scale
that business but if you can convert 1%
of them then with additional tweaking
you can probably convert two to three to
four even 5% of them which is a great
business and then take that learning
scale it as much as you can and then if
it's not a big enough business for your
liking yet then add another industry and
just change the branding on the website
because if you're getting your first
customer to give you all this data
that's your llm and now you it's that's
less friction for customers two through
200 it's going to be much easier to
onboard them right whereas it's going to
you're going to handhold all these
different Industries and it's not going

[50:01]
different Industries and it's not going
to be efficient for you I would start
with just hey serendipitous this is what
I'm doing now I have a chatbot for shed
companies because of one conversation I
had with a guy and you're assuming that
sample size of one can scale and you
might learn on the first day after you
talk to 10 other shed guys that this guy
was a an outlier but probably not okay
yeah great feedback thank you yeah
absolutely I wish the best of luck
thanks Chris yep I think that's it for
today on the the live call-ins we had a
couple others but they weren't able to
make it at this time so I have a few
pre-submitted questions that I'm going
to answer there was one person they
didn't leave any contact information
whatsoever but they didn't want to be
anonymous they asked I'm going to read
their question
exactly how to buy a home in a very
small community under 40 homes where
there are no acceptable homes publicly
for sale now so first of all I'm going

[51:02]
for sale now so first of all I'm going
to focus on one word in here acceptable
acceptable for you I imagine it sounds
this is tough okay sounds like a pretty
exclusive Community under 40 homes the
average homeowner stays in their home
for three years if it's a community like
this that's exclusive and highly sought
after let's call it five years that
means statistically speaking under 40
homes let's say there's 30 five homes
divided by five is seven that means
every two months there should be one
home for sale so according to statistics
you can wait and check out a home every
two months or if you're not wanting to
wait which I imagine you're not the best
way to do it is just to knock all 40
homes as someone who's knocked over
20,000 homes I'll tell you that knocking
40 homes will take you one evening and a
home is a very important decision and
it's one that most people don't take
lightly and so if you really want to
live there I would spend an evening call

[52:01]
live there I would spend an evening call
it a Tuesday or a Thursday night between
6 and 900 p.m. and just knock all the
homes and say hey my name is anonymous
and I really want to live here bring
some sort of a flyer or a business card
or something and try to associate try to
get them to associate you with something
memorable yeah I'm the guy that randomly
knocked on your door that you want to
tie the memory of you to something so
maybe you wear a weird shirt or
something I'm the guy in the flannel or
whatever I'm the guy that wore a coat in
the middle of the summer it'll just be
easier and then if you can get their
phone Andor email and check in with them
every six months or so I'd love to
suggest some cool high-tech option but
this this is a personal decision it's a
big decision for them it's a big
decision for you and I would just knock
all the doors so next question we have
best service to form a legal entity for
a new business in the past I've used
Legal Zoom but there has to be a better

[53:00]
Legal Zoom but there has to be a better
way specifically I need an es Corp in
the state of California so I did not do
any research I don't know of any
websites that does this I'm sure there
are many I hate Legal Zoom I'll just
tell you everyone in the world I I don't
like Legal Zoom I don't like the way
they do business I don't like their
emails their followup there there's all
kinds of shady onboarding practices to
trick you into buying this or that so
don't use Legal Zoom if I were him I
would go to up work and post a job for a
pargal or someone to file an escort it's
going to be a lot cheaper than finding a
lawyer to do it next one is all right
this is a really good one so we just
discovered that our patented tufa stone
quarry may be ground into Pelon I don't
even I've never seen that word in my
life and of use to the cement industry
initial testing will run 3 to 10 10
grand we just put everything into a
sawmill how best to approach this

[54:01]
sawmill how best to approach this
potential opportunity all right so if
I'm understanding this question
correctly you own a stone querry for
patented stua patented Tua stone and you
think it could be used for cement and
you're assuming that could be as if not
more profitable than what you're
currently using it for and it's going to
cost 3 to 10 grand to know for sure to
me this seems like an asymmetric bet 3
to 10 grand I imagine they're are tons
of people in your orbit that would be
willing to pay that for a percentage of
The Upside this reminds me of the guy
that threw away a hard drive in the UK
that had $130 Million worth of bitcoin
on it and he wanted to go dig up the
landfill and he could not afford to do
that it was going to cost like one to
five million bucks so he raised the
money successfully to dig up the
landfill has he found it yet I don't
think so I imagine I would have heard
about it but it's an asymmetric bet you
get you find 10 guys that will each put
in 500 Grand that that's a small

[55:02]
in 500 Grand that that's a small
percentage of their net worth and
they're going to get 40 50 60% of the
$130 million Bitcoin outcome or they'll
get nothing it's a Gamble and there are
a lot of gamblers out there so this is
three to 10 grand honestly I would
probably make that bet email me and uh
if everything looks good I'd probably
take that bet if I get a a percentage of
the revenue or profits so just find an
investor if you don't have the money
last question is a vending machine Biz
oversaturated I don't think any business
is oversaturated any business in the
world that's my hot take for the day and
I'm not just trying to sound
controversial I feel
like people only look at one side of the
equation when they look for saturation
in a market for
example virtual assistant agencies
they're everywhere I've talked about it
before a previous episode every time I
get on Twitter I'm launching a VA agency

[56:00]
get on Twitter I'm launching a VA agency
and it's different it's Latin America
this one's different it's only the
Philippines oh this one's different it's
only Pakistan everyone's launching them
it's saturated it's oversaturated how do
you know how does anyone know if it's
saturated do you know how big the market
is do you know how much demand there is
you it just seems saturated because in
your little bubble everyone's launching
it now if you're launching it in that
bubble and only selling to that bubble
then there's a better chance that it's
saturated but even so there could be
more demand in that bubble than there is
Supply is anything
oversaturated you can't answer that
definitively unless you know how big the
supply and the demand sides are of that
market in that Niche and so if you go
figure that out somehow if you're able
to figure out the size of the market if
you're able to say in Roswell New Mexico
there's 10 plumbers and in every city
every other city in Roswell New Mexico
that matches their demographics ex exact

[57:02]
that matches their demographics ex exact
exactly with the same population there's
five plumbers then I think you could say
with reasonable certainty that it's
oversaturated okay that contradicts what
I said no it doesn't because if there
are twice as many plumbers in Roswell
New Mexico then there should be based on
other demographics of other cities in
New Mexico then it almost certainly
means that those guys are not fully
maximizing the potential of their
business they're not fully marketing as
well as they should have or guess what
they're not out of
business they're still in business right
so I'm assuming they all 10 of them are
still able to feed their families which
means for some weird reason there could
be something going on in Roswell that
makes the demand for plumbing much
higher than average and so I just I take
issue when people say it's oversaturated
because of their anecdotal sample size
seeing something in in their immediate
orbit that seems to be oversaturated

[58:00]
orbit that seems to be oversaturated
when maybe all 10 of those plumbers are
garbage they all have terrible customer
service maybe they're all overpriced and
you could come in there with a fair
price or with great customer service and
be number 11 and do better than the
other 10 so is the vending machine
business oversaturated absolutely not
and I don't need to know anything about
the vending machine Biz to answer that
definitively because there's room for
everyone it's capitalism and and if you
do a better job then that means the
other guy will have less business or go
out of business which means that you

worrying about if something is

the question you should be asking
yourself because there's
opportunity
everywhere so don't worry about the
other guys just worry about what your
preferences are and where you have an
unfair Advantage I think that's it thank
