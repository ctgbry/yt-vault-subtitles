look at this freaking guy right here he
did the most genius things this is a
brilliant business idea because this
post got
114,000 likes which means there is
demand for this product but Hunters
aren't going to go sourcing these
mannequin heads from hair salons it's
not going to happen all you got to do is
start sourcing these from Alibaba or
AliExpress or even get transparent
stickers that they can put on the
plexiglass which would be 99% cheaper
than a mannequin head this could and
should be a product sold on a Shopify
store at Amazon or in Cabella as their
Bass Pro Shops I made the full business
plan for this for free here
