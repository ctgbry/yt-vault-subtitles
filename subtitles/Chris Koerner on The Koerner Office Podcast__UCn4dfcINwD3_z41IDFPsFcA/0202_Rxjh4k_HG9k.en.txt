[00:00]
yeah it could even be a startup that
helps enable that right they sell you a
like a keypad and cameras and you
install them and you could use your
coffee shop or restaurant as like a
co-working space from 4 to 10 and it's
you don't even really need to staff it
because you got to get vetted to get a
membership maybe it's just a monthly fee
and you just swipe your card they know
you're in there there's a camera
watching you they know you're not going
to steal stuff or you know turn over
tables and that would be almost pure
profit
okay welcome to the ker office today I
interviewed the owner of Southern
Grounds and that is a small chain of a
restaurant SLC coffee Concept in Florida
and they're doing something really
unique in that they're succeeding on the
restaurant side of the business and
they're succeeding on the coffee side of
the business whereas usually the
traditional wisdom says pick one you can
only do one thing really well is it
coffee or is it food and he's doing both
really well and I thought that was an
interesting case study furthermore we
talked a lot about business ideas that
he's seeing in the space around the
restaurant and coffee industry that's

[01:01]
restaurant and coffee industry that's
kind of near the end of the episode half
through second or third of the episode I
think you'll really like that part
because he has some good ideas from the
perspective of a restaurant coffee owner
what you might be able to sell someone
like him because if you think about it
there are more restaurants than any
other type of small business in the
United States I could be wrong there
there's about 200,000 gas stations and I
think there's four or 500,000
restaurants and so there's a zillion
business opportunities around selling to
restaurant owners yes even though
they're not very profitable yes even
though they have a high failure rate
there's still a lot of businesses you
can build there so look forward to that
part and let me know what you think well
Mark how do you pronounce your last name
it's janicek janicek what nationality is
that it's Czechoslovakian my dad was
from Prague so it's a have a little bit
of European lineage in that it's funny
because I lived for in Budapest for two
years and some people call Prague the
Paris of Eastern Europe and some people
call budapes the Paris of Eastern Europe
it's such a beauti beautiful city for

[02:00]
it's such a beauti beautiful city for
sure European cities have a lot of gears
on us so it's been incredible yes okay
so tell me where you live and what you
do let's just get started I'm uh the
founder of Southern ground Chef driven
Coffee House coffeee house that puts
sustainable cooking at the Forefront of
its uh brand concept I live in
Jacksonville Florida and we started the
concept about nine years ago we believe
that a great cup of coffee kind of
connects People starts conversation and
creates community and we wanted the
the coffee experience to be a little
different than the national chains that
you are familiar with and we didn't want
it transactional we wanted to be a
gathering place and we created a concept
around community and a relaxing
environment with a seasonal food menu
when you first had this idea or let me
back up what first kind of sprouted this
idea in your head I was born oversees
born in in Singapore lived my childhood
in Athens Greece and I grew up up in a

[03:00]
in Athens Greece and I grew up up in a
home environment where food was
tremendously important and firsthand I
witnessed how Hospitality created joy
and memories and I think that upbringing
defined me at least in my culinary
career I always thought what is greater
than kind of being in a profession that
brings joy to others and makes people
happy on top of that I felt kind of the
coffee experience was lacking something
at least from what I saw in America
and it was mostly transactional
drive-throughs and quick kind of java
experience caffeine experience and you
didn't have a kind of welcoming
environment I wanted to create a
business that would change how the
morning coffee experience was delivered
I wanted a modern coffee house pairing a
sustainable Chef driven
menu and impeccably grown coffee roasted
coffee sourced coffee and I wanted a

[04:01]
coffee sourced coffee and I wanted a
direct trade with the farmer so the
quality of the beans was better in the
beginning we didn't know much about
coffee but we were educated by
intelligencia in Chicago who's the
pioneer of the direct trade movement and
forever grateful for all the resource
and intelligence that they gave us in
our start I'm sure you're you've read
all of Howard Schultz's books and you're
familiar with how Starbucks got their
start
from what I understand he kind of wanted
there to be a what do they call it like
a third home or a third place like he
saw in Italy but they didn't have do you
think that's similar to your founding
story but he just took it in a different
direction like a more corporate
Direction whereas you're keeping it
actually more true to your original
desires I think Starbucks we got to give
a lot of credit to what they did he went
to Italy he sourced the cafe environment
and brought it stat side and he created
this home away from home what makes
Southern Grounds

[05:00]
Southern Grounds
different from other coffee shops not
only do we have the sustainable food
program we have a chef but we have an
array of products that conscious
consumers can reach that go beyond the
cup so our brand thrives I think on
providing healthy food offerings while
building up community in a
non-transactional environment Starbucks
at least started the
conversation where the Barista could
talk about the
the Coffee Bean and the quality of the
coffee is a chef would his sustainable
food program so it allowed the consumer
to touch something differently I think
we're in a different wave of coffee
while the first wave was maybe folders
out of a cup second wave was more uh
social conscious third wave was a
pursuit of better quality kind of the
fourth wave of coffee is going beyond
that seems like one way you've gone
beyond that is by expanding the seating

[06:01]
beyond that is by expanding the seating
area and really making it more of of a
restaurant have you had to struggle with
that like do we focus on the food do we
focus on the coffee how do we focus on
both will we be known for coffee or will
we be known for food has it taken on a
life of its own or is it gone along the
plan that you envisioned originally I
think originally when we studied coffee
houses we traveled a lot and what we
were hearing was that the quality was
missing in the coffee component we
noticed I think the consumer base of
coffee was growing but there was this
kind of missing component of
sustainability and then consumers wanted
organic consumers wanted to know the
where their coffee came from consumers
wanted to know if it was single origin
consumers wanted to know the altitude it
grew at and so forth so I think the
consumers were demanding a little more
out of their coffee
shop then what we heard is that you

[07:00]
shop then what we heard is that you
could have a great coffee shop but no
food program so consumers wanted to have
a place where they could have a healthy
meal we just took that from our Chef's
backgrounds we took that and created
Chef driven kitchens here's kind of a
random question but let's say in a
hypothetical scenario a your landlord
came to you at one of your locations and
said Mark I've got someone that wants to
come in right next door to your to your
business it's either Starbucks or it's
either a highquality new American
restaurant
which would you prefer like which would
you rather compete against quote compete
against right next door to you so I
think we're in a unique spot I think if
a restaurant tour I consider both those
in that category are bringing a concept
to the neighborhood that elevates the
the dining scene in the customer base
then we can all play in the same space
typically better restaurants attract
better restaurants and more consumers to
that area so I think there's almost a

[08:00]
that area so I think there's almost a
regentrification of that neighborhood so
I would welcome them both to come next
to us we are different with what we
offer so I think we're just outside of
competition against a coffee house and
then we're also out of competition of a
full service restaurant so when you
first started your first location did
you get a lot of push back from friends
and family not that you really cared but
you know everyone thinks they're a
genius because they know the restaurant
failure rate and I'm sure a zillion
people tried to to talk you out of that
how did you manage that or or did you
whatsoever great question and I think
you've hit the the nail on the head
we've had certainly some anxiety with
our investors that said hey I don't
believe this concept will work and those
investors actually pulled out of the
concept so we had a tough conversation
among the family and said hey do we
believe in the concept do you think you
can marry a chef-driven kitchen with the
Barista bar as the focal point of a con
concept which hasn't been done

[09:01]
concept which hasn't been done
successfully and we believe that
experience was missing in the restaurant
landscape okay so the original investors
pulled out of your first location right
correct how did you replace them what
was the backup plan we actually didn't
replace them we took the Gamble and took
the risk ourselves so it was a decision
that we believed strongly that our
concept had Merit was there ever a
conversation with them afterwards when
it came time to open you know your
second or third location they they call
all the time do I like I don't know if
you're anything like me but I love that
like I have more supporters than haters
so to speak but I'm grateful for the
supporters but I don't think of them
right like the haters I keep right here
on my shoulder and they're always in my
ear and like those are the guys that I
think to every day does that drive you
at all it might not be politically
correct but I mean honestly I think
we're driven by our own Ambitions to do
something that we think is right and
something that's missing from the

[10:01]
something that's missing from the
landscape you know like I said there's
so many things different from Southern
ground so if you try to pick one point I
don't know if you can but we disrupted
traditional purchasing chain or the
Standard supply chain for coffee houses
by reducing plastic consumption by
50% a lot of people are doing it now but
way back when people weren't saying hey
how can I spend more money on paper
goods in the restaurant because it was
socially important decision but we
wanted the whole brand to move in that
direction there was not too many people
saying how can I spend more money on
organic proteins or sustainable proteins
and not pass that on to the consumer I
would think it's hard to have your cake
and eat it too right like a higher
quality protein without passing the cost
on to the consumer how do you make that
possible are you beating up the vendor a
little more or skipping out middlemen
what does that look like a little bit of
both as we

[11:00]
both as we
grew and our purchasing power with our
supplier or broadliner increased we
could
negotiate stronger deals but how I
circumvented the whole kind of process I
used our broadliner Cisco as the
distribution mechanism for our food and
I created my own relationships with the
farmer and negotiated the price with
them and then had the markup with Cisco
so we went backwards in terms of our
contract negotiation typically it
doesn't work like that for a small
restaurant tour I had a background in
the restaurant business running
multi-units so I understood how the game
was played does that look like you
basically putting in the leg work and
sourcing your own salmon and then going
to Cisco and saying Cisco you don't
carry this salmon but I need you to
carry it here it is can you distribute
this for me correct absolutely right
okay so back to restaurant number one

[12:00]
okay so back to restaurant number one
what did the economics look like to open
that what did it cost to open versus
what did you budget uh for it and what
year was this how did Co play into it if
any oh this was so nine years ago
2015 smaller store I think the general
questions on store economics it depends
on the square footage I think the unique
thing about us is and it plays into how
we were successful through Co I think
one of the unique things about the brand
we said we are okay as restaurant
operators operating in the State of
Florida with 85 9% patio space and small
interior restaurant locations so what it
did for us is reduced Capital costs
reduced running cost for the business
utility cost so forth Furniture costs
everything else was driven outside so
what were your cost to open first store
we were just north of
350,000 how what did you budget 350,000

[13:01]
350,000 how what did you budget 350,000
that's all we had yeah it's interesting
when there's no plan B you got you just
have to make it work you know obviously
March 2020 was a challenge and
government regulations changed the
industry on how many people can sit
inside and stuff indoor dining became a
challenge all our
locations thereafter were designed with
outdoor seating in mind so we had not
only this beginning Pur uit of Wellness
for our community through our food
program and great sustainable you know
supply chain but we had our mission to
nourish nurture and Inspire Healthy
Communities by this Lifestyle brand was
enhanced by having the patios so we
double down on this outdoor kind of
component so every one of our spots as
they grow and as they're continuing to
expand has a major patio component to it
all right right if you are watching this

[14:00]
all right right if you are watching this
clip right now you are watching this on
YouTube and if you are a fan of podcast
please check out my podcast while you're
at it because sometimes I have podcasts
that aren't on YouTube and sometimes I
have YouTubes that aren't on podcast so
check out the Kerner office on any
podcast platform or you can go to TKO
pod.com also my newsletter will'll throw
that in there there are no ads It's
weekly it's different content than my
podcast and YouTube newsletter. chrisj
cerner.com You'll see the link and we'll
see you there yeah I'm sure that was
just perfect for Co you're like I'm glad
we went with this and we did this to
save money but now we're doing this to
save lives now we think we this is a
viable model ongoing and obviously if a
a restaurant tour spends too much money
upfront on the capital asset there's no
way for them to one repay their capital
or to make a profit you're putting too
much demand it's some sacrifice so if
your rent structure is too high if
you're Capital costs or you have bank
loans we were fortunate we did not take
a bank loan and have no debt as of now

[15:00]
a bank loan and have no debt as of now
so with the patio concept I know I'm
getting ahead of myself a little bit
I've gota I'm like building up all these
questions for you as you talk but you're
getting started into franchising let's
say a a potential franchisee wanted to
open a location in Minneapolis how do
you manage that with having 80% outdoor
seating but I think people enjoy sitting
outside even in the winter time have you
had time to to look back and reflect on
that first location cuz I I opened a
retail business in college and I had to
sign a personal guarantee on a 5-year
lease on a a a space that had been
vacant for years I didn't know what I
was doing and looking back I'm just like
wow if if I didn't have that landlord
and that broker and this guy come
together that guy gave me 10 grand like
if one of those seven things don't come
together we don't open holy crap like I
don't know how I made that work because
I'm thinking about you like you had to
bring this brand new concept to a
developer in an ideal location he
probably has people beating down his
door to put something there and he
decides to go with you can you talk a
little bit more about that like was he

[16:02]
little bit more about that like was he
just a good guy did you really have to
sell him on the vision because a lot of
developers like they don't care about
your vision right they've got a perform
it to me in this particular case the
developer was looking for maybe
something different a luxury amenity and
was not going for the national AAA Plus
Prime tenant and that was not a
requirement now you know there is some
developers that have bank loans and Bank
ratios to contend with this person did
not and we are forever grateful that he
understood what we were trying to create
and in our city we were trying to create
something different that we were
inspired with from our travels so we saw
coffee houses of similar ilk throughout
our travels to Europe Central America as
well as the the West Coast which is the
epicenter of coffee in America and we
said maybe we can do it differently he
liked the idea it was a very small space

[17:01]
liked the idea it was a very small space
in a multi-tenant building so he
appreciated I think the Innovation and
the young
entrepreneur how do you acquire
customers outside of finding a really
good location because in my experience
if your location's good enough then you
don't really need to worry about that so
much is that the case for you or are you
doing social media and all those other
things pretty heavily so we do have all
those channels now however in the
beginning we didn't do anything and we
still have not done any advertising per
se that is formal or paid for
advertising we still believe today that
while word am mouth may be the slowest
Avenue to customer acquisition it's the
best and certainly the most robust in
terms of keeping those customers now
your food has to be good the delivery
has to be good the hospitality has to be
good and the overall experience but we
are a hospitality company first and then
we offer a great PR product yeah I love

[18:00]
we offer a great PR product yeah I love
the phrase that which is easily gained
is easily lost like you could easily you
could do direct mailers to the
neighborhood and say free appetizer at
Southern Grounds and they're probably
not going to ever come back if they come
at all whereas if you just put your
location somewhere perfect somewhere
that just fits the clientele and the
area and the climate and that's not easy
to do you can't put a location just
anywhere I assume like Starbucks might
be able to but like that difficulty on
the front end I I imagine will bring you
more long term loyal customers so I
think hospitality is how you make
someone feel our entire training program
and onboarding program is to teach our
people that the kindness that we extend
to a guest is our trademark I like that
the kindness we extend to our guests is
our trademark I like that a lot and it's
hard to replicate like a trademark it is
hard to replicate yes it's easily lost
if you don't focus on it every day but
that's what we focus on every single day
random acts of kindness that we can now

[19:02]
random acts of kindness that we can now
take to the community I like that my
family and I we do we call it rack r k
every Christmas we'll go do random acts
of kindness and it's a little awkward
walking up to a stranger in a in a
grocery store parking lot and giving
them a candy cane and they think you're
trying to poison them poison them but uh
it's we're trying to teach our kids
something but we do the same thing I
think if you can be anything in the
world you should be kind yeah I like
that when you look at your restaurant
compared to a comparable category how do
your margins look like are your food
costs higher than average on a
percentage basis your labor costs or are
you right in the the average territory
or what I think that's a great question
so we don't have a category since we
have this hybrid model of food and
coffee in an environment now if you look
at some of the national change that are
in The Breakfast category they don't
have a robust Barista bar where they're
making 40% of their revenue mixes as
Espress ESO based drinks we are 40%

[20:02]
Espress ESO based drinks we are 40%
espresso based drinks coffee and
anything out of the breea par 50 to 60%
food program gross margins for us is
revenue minus food
cost beverage cost and direct labor cost
so we try to have a goal in all our
stores of a
GP of 40% which is incredibly high for
the market net margin obviously varies
based on fact factors that are specific
to location I.E rent utility cost
insurance my goal there is 15 to 20% how
does your margin compare on your coffee
versus food so our food program cost of
goods on that 30
35% because we have the highest
specialty coffee that we can buy that
single origin direct trade and we have a
seasonal coffee house by intelligencia
where anywhere between 12 and 15% on
that if you could go back and start that

[21:01]
that if you could go back and start that
first restaurant over again what do you
think you would do differently about it
based on what you know today I think
what drives the business is Talent so we
would hire Talent quicker than handling
all the burdens ourselves but because
we're bootstrapping this thing and we
bootstrapped it to now over 10 million
um we're in a different position so
probably the answer is nothing because
those hard lessons has taught us how to
be a better entrepreneur and we
understand the struggle and through the
struggle we have become super obsessed
on our business so this is two questions
in one but let's say a younger
entrepreneur comes to you and says I
want to start a restaurant not what
you're doing but a proper restaurant how
would your advice to him differ from
someone that comes to you and says I
want to start a coffee shop would you
give him a hard dose of reality would
you encourage them how would that look
between both of those two different
questions for me uh the answer is the

[22:00]
questions for me uh the answer is the
same I would follow your dreams my dad
says find something you love and you'll
never work a day in your life and I take
that lesson to heart I truly love what
we're doing I truly love the the
hospitality we're giving the
opportunities we're giving and the
communities we're in so I would just say
Follow Your Passion what advice would
you give them more tactically about how
to open with regards to location or
anything like that costs
so the entrepreneurs left on their own
they have to find their own information
they have to be have initi initiation to
Discovery they have to be open to
failure they have to learn how to handle
stress so all these intangible soft
qualities so there's tangental kind
of businesses associated with being a
general operator in a restaurant you
have to learn about say merchant
services you have to learn about
contract negotiation you have to learn

[23:00]
contract negotiation you have to learn
about lease
negotiation I I would hire experts in
those fields immediately at least is on
a Consulting basis to get educated so
you don't make a huge mistake you shared
with me in your college days you signed
a personal guarantee right and those
things are scary so and I don't know if
young entrepreneurs know what that is
and I don't know if they know the
liabilities how how that could affect
them so I would always surround yourself
with good counsel in legal and real
estate as well as contract law and I
think in a lot of cases if we just do a
little brain exercise we have people in
our friends and family Circle that have
those have that expertise that are
willing to help us for free even for
instance in in my example of a personal
guarantee I used a broker for this base
and I remember him telling me like
you're gonna have to sign a 5-year lease
that's just standard right and this
place had been empty for years and
you're going to have to sign a personal
guarantee like everyone has half a dozen
real estate friends I could have just

[24:00]
real estate friends I could have just
picked up the phone and said hey what do
you think about this and they're like
wait what it's been empty no no no no
six-month lease option to extend no
personal guarantee like I know you're
new at this but you know what I'm saying
like just a simple phone call to a
friend or family member can make all the
difference absolutely sometimes we need
to ask for help right we don't know
everything and I think the more
resources we can get to help us in our
vision people want to help people in our
opinion I agree I think the biggest
deterrent to that is just our our ego
and our pride you know thinking we can
do it ourselves back to the young
entrepreneur example I did email you
this beforehand but are you seeing any
opportunities in this space that you're
too focused on to to capitalize on maybe
in coffee maybe in restaurant maybe in
software around coffee or restaurants
maybe in the supply chain so tangental
businesses to the core restaurant
business I think there are a few I mean
we touched on a little bit I think
merchant services I think that's a huge
category so these POS providers provide
an all one in all's kind of Step but I

[25:02]
an all one in all's kind of Step but I
think and that's how we do it we
currently purchase the merchant services
through our POS provider but if someone
could create I think a less expensive
alternative to take credit card fees and
reduce the fees to a small business
under say call three million in Revenue
that would be incredible and I think
ignite kind of entrepreneurial spirit I
think another difficult task surrounding
just startup is supply chain negotiation
so I think if there could be almost a
training center or maybe a tutorial
program that would teach contract
negotiation and food supply or contract
negotiation in Commodities coffee being
one of them
and understand the liabilities that you
have if you try to be too risky in that
approach could that help the young
entrepreneur I think that's where a lot

[26:00]
entrepreneur I think that's where a lot
of people get involved and open up their
risks because they don't know what
they're doing and then they're almost
loaded with debt at least to the vendor
they don't have good margins Street
accounts for normal broad liners are 15%
while a national chain is three and a
half% what's a broadliner like Cisco one
of these big distribution companies US
Foods US Foods PFG all those kind of
things so we had once again and
wellwishers and we believe the universe
conspires to help you but we had
wellwishers that taught us all these
things and I had a history of being on
procurement councils for my old
multi-tenancy job and I understood that
portion of it but I didn't understand
real estate so I had a very kind
developer that taught us that in the
beginning and says look out for these
certain things why CPI is even important
why is that even a clause in the
contract what does CPI increase mean so
forth so that that could be an
opportunity I think so the restaurant

[27:00]
opportunity I think so the restaurant
business has a lot of waste I'll just
talk in the coffee business we go
through about th000 lounds of coffee a
week in all our kind of shops and could
someone repurpose the spent grounds in
our coffee and not just somebody trying
to pick up 50 pounds but a coffee waste
recycling company that could repurpose
it for beauty products or gardening
supplies or fertilizer I'm just trying
to think of some of the the waste that
we can that we can make an enlightened
Circle or you know cycle of non waste
could you do and depending I mean You'
have to get with municipalities here but
could you do that on plastic waste too
California and some of these other
cities are great in recycled waste you
know on the East Coast we don't have
good recycle program so what do we do
with our plastic waste we chose an
organization to go with sustainable cups
and sugar can cup so it's all disposable

[28:00]
and sugar can cup so it's all disposable
but other companies for cost reasons are
going to plastic and does plastic harm
the environment and what could we do
with that in a a thoughtful way I like
the the coffee grounds idea it's funny
because just this morning I interviewed
a guy that owns a lawn leveling business
and he he's very unique and his sales
pitch is that he will make your lawn
look like a golf course and he has to
put infill whether it's sand or mulch or
whatever and a lot of times this infill
has large sticks in it and you can't
have a golf course like grass with Big
Sticks sticking out of it so he told me
he's inventing his own proprietary blend
of lawn leveling mixture that is mostly
coffee grounds I thought that was really
because these conversations are just a
few hours apart he's mixing it with
manure and some other things but if
there was a like an enterprising
entrepreneur that called you and said
hey I I want to take your coffee grounds
what would that how would you approach
that would you say okay great or what
are you going to do with it or what are
you currently doing with your coffee
grounds are they just going going into
the trash they are they're going into

[29:00]
the trash they are they're going into
the trash we have some people that pick
it up for their home gardens and stuff
but it's not a concentrated effort or
structured approach to it here's another
thing most coffee houses business is
from 6:00 a.m. to 400 p.m. MH and the
space is still available from 400 p.m.
to 10: right they're still paying lease
they're still paying electric they're
still paying insurance so how do you
maximize coffee houses in the evening
could you have a business just
completely surrounded as an event
marketing
business to event to promote space and
events in coffee houses that aren't busy
anyway could it help the coffee house
kind of purveyor build revenue in
non-revenue generating traditional times
I think that's a incredible opportunity
for a young startup and someone who
wants to hustle and good with the public
and wants to to get out there and make a
name for himself with very little

[30:00]
name for himself with very little
startup costs yeah it could even be a
startup that helps enable that right
like let's say a startup that sells you
and they could wh label all this they
could just buy this from existing
vendors they sell you a like a keypad
and cameras and you install them and you
could use your coffee shop or restaurant
as like a co-working space from 4 to 10
and it's you don't even really need to
staff it because you got to get vetted
to get a membership maybe it's just a
monthly fee and you just swipe your card
they know your in there there's a camera
watching you they know you're not going
to steal stuff or you know turn over
tables that and that would be almost
pure profit pure profit absolutely
there's a lot of tangental business in
our you know we struggled in the
beginning launching our own branded
beverages we thought that was important
for at least a marketing call for our
own business to to bring attention to
what we were doing so we created a Nitro
cold boo coffee but if you go to a third
party co-packer with your recipe they

[31:01]
party co-packer with your recipe they
want I don't know two three four pallets
or 15 barrels of liquid so the cost is
exorbitant we couldn't do it for six
seven years until we had the capital
that we could do it if there was a
startup that says I can do it for as
little as as a hundred cans I think
there would be a global industry on cpg
business for that the consumer package
goods for our Niche would be
unbelievable yeah and they can still
charge more right because it's more of a
niche offering like I had a company that
did something very similar it was called
send eats and we were a thirdparty
logistics provider for cpg Consumer
package Goods food brands because let's
say you had this a protein bar that you
wanted to sell well no one else wanted
to deal with you we weren't a co-packer
but we would pick pack and ship your
orders and we charge more than the big
guys but we were the only ones that
would take them right so we were able to
so if someone were to call you let's say
they had an idea for the coffee grounds

[32:01]
they had an idea for the coffee grounds
maybe it was lawn leveling maybe compost
is that an easy sell for you quote sell
it's just like like yeah I'd rather not
throw them away come get them or is
would they have to twist your arm a
little bit you know someone helped us
get where we are and I am forever
grateful for that assistance so if I
could help in any way help another young
entrepreneur or entrepreneur in this
space get to where his dreams are would
certainly do it yeah there was a company
called EOS scraps that did this with
grocery stores out of Utah they would
not get it for free they would be paid
to take all of their produce that was
going bad that the grocery Source had
been throwing away and then they just
turned it into compost and then they
sold that compost at 300% markup because
it was so good and they ended up selling
to some multinational company I love
that story I love that story every dream
very entrepreneur right yes and I think
there was someone else that did it with
like juice bars they would go get get
the pulp all the leftover pulp for free

[33:00]
the pulp all the leftover pulp for free
and turn it into compost and then TX is
like the decking company the decking
yeah yeah that's he literally just took
grocery bags from Walmart shredded them
mixed them with sawdust and he invented
this new material that never dies which
is normally bad but if you have a deck
it's pretty dang good I just love that
business model here's another question
for you
so as you're growing like what are your
plans for expansion I know you looked at
franchising you've opened multiple
corporate
locations if you go the franchising
route which I think you are what why
that over opening more corporate stores
so we have
both both Avenues in our growth strategy
the first one is 50 stores on the
corporate growth side in in our regional
market in cities that we've selected so
we have that four a year on the
corporate side and we I think that's a
good Pace to keep quality consistent and

[34:03]
good Pace to keep quality consistent and
not jeopardize the brand through
irresponsible growth on the franchise
side we want to pick select multi-unit
partners with a track record of
success understand the business buy into
our vision and want to be able to create
a wealth through franchising of a proven
system with 10 years of History right so
we think we can get to 250 stores
regionally over the next 15 years
through
picking and being very Discerning about
the franchise Partners we on board so
proven track record understand what we
do understand the kitchen environment
understand hospitality and have
Hospitality in their portfolio what do
you think a an ideal franchisee would
look like for your brand because I know
it's different for every brand if you're

[35:00]
it's different for every brand if you're
starting a pressure washing franchise
versus a restaurant how picky are you
and what does that person look like so I
think to protect our brand we're going
to be incredibly selective so the person
needs to have the capital wherewithal to
at least expand into a multi-unit
scenario the minimum amount of stores we
would sell would be a package of
three now you could put three in a
smaller Market if we're averaging auvs
of $2.3 million you're talking somewhere
to 7 million in Revenue as a small
business that is I think that's pretty
good for a small market and you're doing
something great for the community
introducing a coffee shop where you can
make the central Hub of your community
for larger markets we would sell so
Tampa for example we just sold nine to
aen operator that really loves loves our
brand speaks our language and

[36:00]
brand speaks our language and
understands Hospitality went to school
USF for college of Rosen in Orlando
studied hospitality and wants to do this
as their entrepreneurial effort so you
could have a small operator who's very
ambitious you could have a multi-unit
operator that wants to get into the
business or you can have someone that
wants to grow a hospitality company has
resources and then hires professionals
to run their B business as a way to
diversify Holdings income and so forth
okay well that's awesome I didn't
realize you had sold those territories
in Tampa that's exciting we're we're
very excited about it the first one
should open up in December they got
South Tampa and St Pete okay all right
