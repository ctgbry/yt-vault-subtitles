look at this freaking guy right here
this guy makes 15 grand a month building
custom garage shelves and selling them
exclusively on Facebook Marketplace
here's exactly how you can copy him so
he was making five grand a month doing
this part-time borrowing his neighbor's
truck and delivering on the weekends and
then one day he said hey babe I think we
could make a lot of money doing this if
I quit my job so he did and he tripled
his income here are the details he sells
these shelves for $770 and he pays $200
for materials all he needs is a chops
from Home Depot and some screws I just
spent an hour talking to him the shelves
are way too big to ship so anyone in any
local market could build and sell them
for the same prices locally where does
he get his customers where does he get
his cheaper materials full interview
