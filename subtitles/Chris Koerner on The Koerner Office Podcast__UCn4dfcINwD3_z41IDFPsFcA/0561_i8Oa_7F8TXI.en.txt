look at this freaking thing right here
so on the surface this is a cool fun
idea these guys took a used van and they
turned into a sauna drove to a cold lake
and they're doing what's called contrast
therapy but there's a business here
which I'll get to in a second now what's
contrast therapy it's basically shocking
your system to go between hot and cold
over and over two to five times it helps
with metabolism fat loss circadian
rhythm yada yada yada but look how much
money people charge for contrast therapy
but that's to do it in a big expensive
facility go find yourself a used van
that doesn't look like it kidnaps kids
on the weekends build one of these
things out and sell this service for a
fraction of the price you've got a
business on your hand full business plan
right here
