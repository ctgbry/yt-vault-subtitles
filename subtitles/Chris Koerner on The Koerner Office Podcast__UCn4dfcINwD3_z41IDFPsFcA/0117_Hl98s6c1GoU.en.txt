my good friend opened the first indoor
sledding facility in the United States
and why did he open because there was an
outdoor sledding facility that was
printing money first of all you will
never believe how much money this guy
makes indoor sledding second of all you
will never believe how he learned to
copy his competitor it was quite
brilliant so his competitor had a webcam
up where you could see how many people
at any given time were sledding down the
hill and they also had an online
ticketing system where they only sold
150 tickets a day so he had two forms of
copying them one he would use a clicker
and literally watch how many people
sledded down the hill two he would see
how many tickets they sold online every
day that told him exactly how much money
he could make if he competed against
them directly and today he owns a
sledding facility that makes $6 million
a year with over 50% net margins listen
