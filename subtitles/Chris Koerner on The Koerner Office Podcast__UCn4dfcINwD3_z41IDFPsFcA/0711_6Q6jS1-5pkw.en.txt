[00:00]
And I'm like, "Okay, there's definitely
demand for this." And I started looking
into the companies, couldn't find any.
So, I just was like, "Holy smokes." You
know, I definitely kind of stumbled upon
this industry. We're like, "All right,
let's do it." So, the first month I was
like 17,000.
&gt;&gt; What's your average job size?
&gt;&gt; It's about 3100. We've got around 70,000
on the schedule for each month up to
October.
&gt;&gt; You'll do a million next year.
&gt;&gt; The new machinery got 0% financing for
60 months. Somebody's going to kill it
with that little machine. You just have
somebody who's operating joysticks from
standing off to the side.
&gt;&gt; Had you ever used one before?
&gt;&gt; We've never used one.
&gt;&gt; Have you ever done a home service
business before?
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; So, I was scrolling on Twitter the other
day and I find this guy named Alex and
he started a brush clearing company in
Cincinnati, Ohio. And his first month,
he did almost $18,000 in revenue with
85% net profit margins. Why did he start
this? Because he learned, "Holy crap,

[01:01]
this? Because he learned, "Holy crap,
there is a ton of demand for brush
clearing in my area and almost no one is
fulfilling this demand." Because he had
just bought 5 acres and he needed brush
clearing. So, having never started a
home service or a local business or a
sweaty startup before, he said, "I'm
going to do this. I'm going to start a
brush clearing business because I know
there is so much demand for it and I can
charge $2,000 a day. You can get the
equipment financed. You can start this
for very little money and there's a ton
of markets that have way more demand
than supply. We got super tactical. We
held nothing back. You are going to love
this. Please share it with a friend,
especially someone that might be
interested in starting a local service
business with very little money and very
high margins. Tell me about how you even
stumbled upon this industry. So, I
bought a house and we have five acres.
Four of it was wooded and I was like,
"Okay, well, I have this nice yard, but
I can't even use it. So, how do I clear
this?" And I started looking into it and
I couldn't find anybody. The closest

[02:01]
I couldn't find anybody. The closest
person was over 100 miles away.
&gt;&gt; I don't want to dox you, but like what
what was the population or the size of
your city? How far are you from a major
metroplex that we might have heard of?
just to give us some bearing.
&gt;&gt; So, I'm about 30 minutes from downtown
Cincinnati.
&gt;&gt; Okay. In like a small rural city.
&gt;&gt; It used to be 10 years ago was a lot
more rural. There's a lot more suburbs
out here now, but so I'm kind of right
on the edge of the suburbs. So, the
there's like a thousand acre farm near
me.
&gt;&gt; And then, you know, on the other side,
you've got just tons and tons of
subdivisions.
&gt;&gt; I'm kind of right on that edge.
&gt;&gt; It's funny because we're very similar. I
I live 30 minutes from downtown Dallas
and I'm like right near all the major
Dallas suburbs, Plano, McKini and all
that, but I'm in like this little rural
pocket.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; Where it's the best, isn't it? You have
property.
&gt;&gt; It's perfect. We have three acres.
&gt;&gt; Not a lot of it is wooded, but I've
rented a skid steer about four times and

[03:01]
rented a skid steer about four times and
I have no problem finding someone to
because I mean there's 8 million people
in Dallas and I'm close enough. Right.
&gt;&gt; Right. Right. But you're in a much
different situation from as far as like
population is concerned.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, Texas is interesting. They're one
of the few saturated mulching markets
from what I've heard.
&gt;&gt; Interesting.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, somebody out there must be
really promoting it and doing really
well with it. Um or a multitude of
companies. One of the guys I've met is
from Texas and he just traveled up here
because there there was no competition.
&gt;&gt; Wow. Okay. So you bought five acres,
four of which were wooded, and you need
someone to come out and clear it, at
least to some extent. You can't find
anyone within 100 miles.
&gt;&gt; Yep. So then that got me thinking. I
said, "Well, you know, could could I do
this?" And and I started looking into
it. I started looking around at my
neighbors and I'm like, "Everybody needs
this." in Ohio and I'm not necessarily
sure in other states, but in Ohio in
particular, especially our area, we have

[04:02]
particular, especially our area, we have
this plant called honeysuckle. I know
it's pretty prevalent everywhere, but um
here in particular, it's really bad. And
everybody has this problem. It's
overgrowing on them constantly. What
happens if you have any sort of property
and you mow it'll over time, you know,
five years from now, you've lost 15 feet
of your property because it just keeps
creeping over and over and over. So, I
just saw that everywhere and I'm like,
"Okay, this is there's definitely demand
for this." And I started looking into
the companies, couldn't find any. I
found some owner operators that were
just promoting on marketplace. They
didn't really have like a brand or
anything kind of established. And so I
started doing keyword research and I'm
kind of learning, you know, off of X
that I'm kind of doing like this old
school version of keyword research,
probably because I I did it a lot back
in the early 2000 or mid 2000s, but I
just sat down and I said, "Okay, what

[05:00]
just sat down and I said, "Okay, what
people don't seem to know what forestry
mulching is. If I type in forestry
mulching, I'm hardly getting any sort of
results. I talk to friends, talk to
family, they're like, what is forestry
mulching?" Mhm.
&gt;&gt; So, I just started asking them. I said,
"Okay, let's say you wanted to clear
your your property. You've got this
problem. It's been overgrowing. You've
lost 20 ft. What are you going to search
to try and find this?" And so, people
were giving me ideas, you know, clear my
woods, get rid of this wild rose,
destroy hunting suckle, and I just
started taking this list into a
spreadsheet of all the different terms
that people would search for. And then I
used a a keyword tool, typing in those
and seeing how much how many results
they're getting.
&gt;&gt; Which tool did you use?
&gt;&gt; I think it was SEM Rush. It's been about
Yeah. two years since I did it. But
&gt;&gt; unlike ah refs, they actually have a
free trial. So
&gt;&gt; yeah. Yeah, that's Yep. Yep. I almost
never pay for those tools.
&gt;&gt; Oh pro. No, never.

[06:00]
&gt;&gt; Oh pro. No, never.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So I just noticed there's this
huge s search traffic. So I just was
like, "Holy smokes." you know, I
definitely kind of kind of stumbled upon
this uh industry. I don't know anything
about it and I just started looking into
the equipment and then uh my my business
partner Zach he was a part of this whole
idea process as well and I was just you
know all the time like okay let's see
this is what the search state is showing
this I think we can do this and then we
just kind of were like all right let's
do it I know how to run ads I know
marketing I I I think uh you know we can
solve this problem that I'm I'm seeing
with other companies and what I mean by
that so I actually reached out to some
tree service companies because if you're
trying to get this done, you would
think, okay, maybe I'll just contact the
tree service company. And what I found
was these guys don't know how to sell
this this service. And they also don't
have the operators. So, you can't take a
tree service guy and stick them in these

[07:01]
tree service guy and stick them in these
machines. So, they've never really
pursued this even though they got asked
about it a lot. How to sell it is
through content marketing. M
&gt;&gt; and that's I I was like, "Okay, I think
that's the answer. That's how we sell
this." And so we went and bought the
machine and we didn't have any jobs on
his schedule. I kind of cobbled together
an ad. I actually used like Bobcat's
YouTube channel where they had a
forestry mulching demo to kind of cobble
together my first ad.
&gt;&gt; You borrowed their video.
&gt;&gt; I borrowed their I was like, "Well, it's
Bobcat. I'm using their equipment.
They're pretty cool there, right?"
&gt;&gt; Sure.
&gt;&gt; I was like, "Until I at least get my own
videos." And yeah, so I mean we got
inundated pretty quickly.
&gt;&gt; Now when you say content marketing, you
mean like paid content marketing, not
necessarily organ
&gt;&gt; not necessarily. So like YouTube, I I
consider YouTube like content marketing.
It should be used as content marketing.
You know, people have YouTube channels
where they're trying to get tons of
views. And I didn't approach YouTube
that way. I don't really I don't care at
all about the view count. I needed

[08:00]
all about the view count. I needed
something that that would support the
business and support the service and
support the marketing process. So I kind
of see YouTube as a content marketing
outlet in that sense.
&gt;&gt; So are you because to me content
marketing is not the first thing I think
of when I think of a local service
business because you know the the
YouTube algorithm will spread your video
far and wide, not necessarily to people
that live in Cincinnati or thereabouts.
So how do you approach that?
&gt;&gt; So I actually use local keywords. So
when you're putting in your tags, I use
the local keywords. I'll do like
Cincinnati forestry mulching as part of
my tags on YouTube videos. And
&gt;&gt; interesting.
&gt;&gt; The reason is is because if somebody
local is searching that on Google and
you know how it shows the video results
kind of up there first, it's more likely
to show my video to them. So because
it's specifically for my area. So I kind
of use adwords keywords and ascent onto
my YouTube tags.
&gt;&gt; So here's how this works. I make you
free videos. I actually know what I'm

[09:01]
free videos. I actually know what I'm
talking about. I have no greasy sales
pitch at the end. And if you implement
what I talk about, you'll make a lot
more money and have a better life. And
all I ask for in return is that you hit
the subscribe button and maybe even the
notification bell just like that. Thank
you. So, is the hope then that someone
local to your area who needs your
service, they don't know it yet. They're
just kind of they're typing around,
they're clicking around, they're looking
for content related to it because maybe
they want to rent one themselves and do
it or something and then they see you
and then they're thinking, "Yeah, let me
just have this guy do it."
&gt;&gt; Not necessarily. So that that's kind of
the a perk of it is that if somebody's
looking for it specifically, we're going
to show up. But that's where the meta
ads come in because, you know, I see
meta ads totally different than Google
Adwords. Google Adwords is somebody's
looking for your service. You're bidding
against other people looking for your
service.
&gt;&gt; Meta to me is they're not looking for my
service. I'm going to knock on the door
and and sell this to them essentially,
right? That's the way I see meta. You're

[10:01]
right? That's the way I see meta. You're
interrupting their their flow, you know,
when they're scrolling through their
timeline. And so, we just made I was
like, "Okay, well, I'll make a cool
video." You know, highlight the problem
first. Show that you're local. Local is
the number one because people don't like
you're not going to pay attention to it
if you're not local. If if they see, oh,
wow, this these people are local. Oh,
dang. This is cool. Look at this thing
in slow motion shredding this tree. And
then I kind of introduce the service
into that ad video. And then when people
see that, I want them to say, "Well, I
have this problem." They weren't
necessarily looking for me. I just have
to show them like, "Here's a solution to
a problem you probably complain about
every spring when the leaves come back
on the trees, right?"
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And so that's the way I use meta ads.
And then I I put the YouTube link on the
ad and then they go to our YouTube
channel and they see, okay, look at all
this content. Look at this job. Look at
this before and after. these guys are
this machine is crazy. They've never
seen this before. And then they I got to

[11:01]
seen this before. And then they I got to
call them and and that's what happens.
So we essentially reinforce that ad
through our YouTube channel.
&gt;&gt; We create fans. I mean it's crazy. I
would say almost every customer has
watched our YouTube channel.
&gt;&gt; Some of them have watched every video
&gt;&gt; and they still do. Even in the ones
we've already, you know, served.
&gt;&gt; That's amazing. I'm so glad this
conversation took this direction because
I didn't know you were going to talk
about YouTube or content marketing at
all.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, but this is awesome because I own a
tree trimming business and that's not
even
&gt;&gt; on our radar content marketing.
&gt;&gt; So, I'm actually this winter I'm going
to be doing one for tree service.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Not not for my company. I'm going to I'm
going to help out somebody else.
&gt;&gt; So, you're going to be like kind of an
agency to another local tree trimming
business to help them with content.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I only do that kind of stuff
if I think it's fun and cool to do. And
I think this one, this is a big tree
service company. I think he's like six
million a year. And he's referral only.
He does not advertise.
&gt;&gt; Wow. How long has he been around?
&gt;&gt; I want to say doing tree service for 8

[12:02]
&gt;&gt; I want to say doing tree service for 8
to 10 years.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, I pulled up your YouTube
channel. You've been doing this for a
year now on YouTube.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, we we just crossed our we're
about a year and a month that we've been
doing this business.
&gt;&gt; Okay. And you started YouTube on day one
basically.
&gt;&gt; Started on day one. Yep. Because I knew
I needed the I I needed the videos. I
like photography. I like videography as
a hobby. So I just I love doing it
anyways. I knew people would think this
is cool to watch. So I I went out and
took my cameras and went out and
recorded the first job. I utilized a lot
of that footage for the ads.
&gt;&gt; So yeah, and then I just kind of kept
going. I just like doing it. You know,
eventually you'd have to pay someone to
do it, but I just like it. So,
&gt;&gt; are you editing it yourself as well?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, you're
&gt;&gt; good. But the thing is is like it
doesn't have to be that good. It just
has to show people something.
&gt;&gt; So, are you just setting up a phone on a

[13:01]
&gt;&gt; So, are you just setting up a phone on a
tripod or two phones or two cameras or
what does your hardware look like?
&gt;&gt; So, I have a like a camcorder, a 4K
camcorder. I've got action cameras. I
have a Sony mirrorless camera. I
actually just got a like a pen on camera
was the the Go 3S, the Insta 360. So
yeah, I have all kinds of different
cameras. I I used to travel the country
and go to national parks so
&gt;&gt; and record stuff. So
&gt;&gt; this is awesome. Are you able to
attribute a a specific percentage of
your business to YouTube? And if so,
what does it kind of look like? give or
take
&gt;&gt; directly from YouTube or
&gt;&gt; just like the customers that touched
YouTube in in some way?
&gt;&gt; Uh I would say most so probably around
80%.
&gt;&gt; Wow. It's not independent of your meta
ad strategy. It complements it.
&gt;&gt; It complements it. Yep.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; The YouTube is for the ad strategy.

[14:00]
&gt;&gt; The YouTube is for the ad strategy.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Basically,
&gt;&gt; that's so support it.
&gt;&gt; Are your most successful meta ads video?
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Yeah, without a doubt. Yeah.
Okay.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Image ads just image ads aren't
even worth it. I don't even run image
ads. People just scroll right past. If
you don't have like the perfect picture
that's going to interrupt them scrolling
on their feed, then
&gt;&gt; you know, so videos are videos are much
more interesting.
&gt;&gt; You're confining it to a geographical
radius and correct.
&gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. So, so okay, that's a
that's an interesting thing. I think a
lot of people get wrong about meta ads
and agencies get it wrong. A lot of
people get this wrong. So, I don't
confine it necessarily by a radius. I
specifically choose zip codes where
they're more likely to have large
property. So, because if I I don't want
to blanket an ad to people who won't buy
it because then you're at you're
spending money to people who won't buy
it. And then I target and I say, "Okay,

[15:00]
it. And then I target and I say, "Okay,
well, how do I target people who own
land, right? Specifically land." And so
in those zip codes, I'll target people
who have an interest in Tractor Supply
Company or Rural King.
&gt;&gt; And then Yeah. So I'm I'm only bidding
on people who are over the age of 35. So
they have money, they have they likely
have land, and they're within my range.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I said radius. I meant geofence,
like you're geofencing your ads. You're
not you're not trusting Facebook,
&gt;&gt; right,
&gt;&gt; to show it to to people in a certain
geographical area. You're picking zip
codes in this case. And
&gt;&gt; yeah, I don't trust Facebook's audience
algorithm at all.
&gt;&gt; I like to choose it and and you should
pick it because there's no sense in
advertising to people who wouldn't buy
your service.
&gt;&gt; So, do you do any paid stuff on YouTube
or is it only organic? No, I don't do
any. No, it's all organic. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Do you have like a particular

[16:00]
&gt;&gt; Okay. Do you have like a particular
cadence that you like to release YouTube
videos or is it
&gt;&gt; No, it's it's more so if I'm available
to do it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; I maybe, you know, I used to say record
one out of every five jobs. Now it's
maybe one out of every 10. I'm going to
be doing a lot more videos uh because
I've stopped ads. We were booked out too
far. It's hard to tell somebody on a
quote like, "Hey, uh how about October?"
Yeah,
&gt;&gt; know it's the middle of July.
&gt;&gt; So, um, and I also want to leave that
kind of last month of of heavy running
open for referrals. I want people that
that we've done work for to be able to
refer their friend and then us to be
able to put them on the schedule this
year.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, back to the research. So,
there weren't clear search terms for
this because it's an obscure service.
Clearly, people are searching for it.
They're probably just not calling it
like the official name,
&gt;&gt; right? They have no idea what to look,
right? How to look
&gt;&gt; which g which gave you an opportunity.

[17:00]
&gt;&gt; which g which gave you an opportunity.
So you assembled a bunch of keywords
yourself. This probably took a few
hours. Then you looked at the search
volume relative few days
&gt;&gt; the search volume relative to other
industries and or other markets.
Correct.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; And this was just like screaming at you
like start this business.
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Yeah. I mean it's people have
this problem. I have if I have the
problem then other people have it too
you know so other people have it way
worse I've learned
&gt;&gt; have you ever done a home service
business before like a sweaty startup
but okay
&gt;&gt; that's that's encouraging
&gt;&gt; all right so let's talk timeline 13
months ago you hadn't booked any jobs
you didn't like pre-book stuff and then
go rent a skid steer or buy a skid steer
after you had jobs booked correct you
bought a skid steer how much was it and
then what did you do
&gt;&gt; so I think it was around $90,000 and
that was used with the head. Um, and it
was a used head as well. The reason that
we didn't rent was because they were
Bobcat charges 2700 a day to rent it.

[18:03]
Bobcat charges 2700 a day to rent it.
&gt;&gt; Oh.
&gt;&gt; Oh, man.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, so I was like, that's that's
crazy. But they do that. And a lot of
times they'll only rent to forestry
companies. They won't even rent to other
people like an individual
&gt;&gt; because this isn't just an average skid
steer you you need, right? Like I rent a
skid steer. I love it. It's my favorite
Saturday of the month and it's like 450
bucks for a day and it just has a
bucket. There's no fancy attachment and
it's probably a $25,000 skid steer.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So, so these skid steers,
they have to be the large ones. They
have to have at least high flow. So,
what hydraulic flow and they have to
have the forestry kit. So, the forestry
kit is like an additional $15,000 kit.
It's got a a fall guard on the top. So
if you cut it down a tree, it's not
going to smash the cabin. It's got 3/4
3/4 inch polycarbonate screens all the
way around. So the windshield, the side
windows, the debris kit as well, so it

[19:00]
windows, the debris kit as well, so it
keeps debris from going out down into
the engine. They're pretty much once you
get the forestry kit on these, they're
purpose-built for this.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And then you need the head in
addition to that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So the head is included in the
90,000. I think we paid 15,000 for the
used head.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Okay.
&gt;&gt; We just bought a new head and it was
38,000.
&gt;&gt; Holy cow.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. For the Yeah. And we just bought a
new machine, too. I think overall we
ended up around 129
&gt;&gt; for the new machine. However, the new
machine totally worth it. We will
probably end up paying double on this
used machine because
&gt;&gt; this stuff is hard on the equipment.
It's It's definitely hard on the
equipment and having that warranty is
very, very important. And Bobcat's very
good about their warranty. Pretty much
everything they'll fix under warranty
and they'll give you a new machine. So
your your cost on the machine under a
warranty is very very low.
&gt;&gt; So one of your regrets is not buying is
buying used. If you could go back, you

[20:00]
buying used. If you could go back, you
would buy new. What do the financing
options look like on these? Both new and
used.
&gt;&gt; The new machine we got 0% financing for
60 months.
&gt;&gt; What percent down?
&gt;&gt; We had to put 5,000 down on that. That's
nothing.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Not not a lot.
&gt;&gt; Holy cow.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. They were doing some big Bobcat
sales event. So the financing I believe
is through Ducson or somebody works
directly. Ducson owns Bobcat. And then
the used machine
we're around 7.8%
at the time. So
&gt;&gt; So what does your payment look like on
both the 90,000 and the 130,000?
&gt;&gt; So the 90,000 around 1,400 a month.
130 around 1,900 a month
&gt;&gt; man. Okay. So you could pay for that in
one job.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh yeah. That's what we want to
stay under that. So we want to stay
under one job and well at least you know
the revenue of one job. We just like
that number. It makes the payment
negligible.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. So just one job a month and

[21:03]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. So just one job a month and
our overhead is zero essentially.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Are you storing this at your house on
your property?
&gt;&gt; I was. So we just got a shop space. So,
at my property, we we had a storm. My
barn wasn't big enough, right? They were
sitting outside. We didn't want that to
affect the machine. They're tearing up
my yard, too, which I didn't like. So,
yeah,
&gt;&gt; we ended up getting a shop space. We
just got the shop last month.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; And the shop is Thank you. Appreciate
the shop is 1,500 a month. So, which is
I think it's on the high end, but we got
the HVAC because we're going to run
winter as well.
&gt;&gt; And how many square feet? It's 2,000
square feet.
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's good. That'd be really good
for DFW. Okay, so day one, you've got
this $90,000 liability. I'm shocked that
you can get in this thing for five
grand. I know that's a new deal, not a
used machine deal, but that's shocking
to me. I Tyler, my stump grinding
friend, he bought a 60 $70,000 stump
grinder. I think he had to put 20% down

[22:01]
grinder. I think he had to put 20% down
on it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, I think a lot of that had to
do with We have a lot of history in
businesses. So the lenders really looked
at that. Like if if you've never started
a business, a successful business
before, they really don't like that. So
they don't like just taking the risk on
new guys. But they will, you know, they
will. Especially if your credit's good,
they don't care.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. At the end of
&gt;&gt; the day.
&gt;&gt; Or your wife's credit's good.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Or your wife's credit's
good.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So day one.
&gt;&gt; So day one, I'm just, you know, we get
the machine in. We take it to my
property to start testing it out,
getting used to it.
&gt;&gt; So, had you ever used one before? Did
you do this on your own property? Had
you rented one or was this brand new to
you?
&gt;&gt; We've never used one.
&gt;&gt; I love it.
&gt;&gt; My partner is the our main operator
right now. And he he had run some stuff
before. Not not quite like this.
&gt;&gt; Pushed a lawn mower before.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But he picked it up pretty quick.
So, and I used that opportunity of us

[23:00]
So, and I used that opportunity of us
testing it to get footage and and
things. And we also like kind of broke
it down, pull all the because it was a
rental. It was in the rental fleet. So,
we pulled all the rent stickers off of
it,
&gt;&gt; put our branding on it. When we made the
decision, I started the ads and then we
immediately started getting leads and we
basically had a job on the schedule
within two days of getting the
&gt;&gt; Let's talk tactical about your ads. So
you you talked about your your targeting
strategy geographically by zip more
rural zip code codes 35 or older land
owners tractor supply interest etc. What
about like placement are you you v video
in the Facebook newsfeed, Instagram
newsfeed, stories, reels, etc.
&gt;&gt; Yes. So I'm I let all of everywhere. So
I my goal is kind of it's a lead ad, but
I want exposure. the more exposure I can
get on it, the the more placements I can
get on it, the more people know about
this service. And so that's why, you

[24:00]
this service. And so that's why, you
know, I I've never been threatened by
another company that's starting up or
anything like that because in this
industry, we need people advertising. We
need these companies because we need it.
We're going to expand the ocean
essentially.
&gt;&gt; Yep. Grow the pie. And I think that's an
important distinction because depending
on what your strategy is, sometimes I
only do like Facebook and Instagram
reels. Sometimes I only do Facebook
newsfeed. But for something like this, I
can see the value to doing there's like
23 different ways places you can put it.
Audience network, the right side of the
page, stories, reels, Facebook reels.
&gt;&gt; So I see your logic here because there
are only so many people in six zip codes
outside of Cincinnati that are 35 and
older that own land. Like that's a very
small market. So you want to look
everything everywhere all at once to
them, right?
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; Okay. All right. So you put it
everywhere. Videos. What types of
videos? Is it just you talking to the
camera? Is it you, you know, in action?
It's sort of like a highlight reel kind
of video. So it it leads off with, you

[25:02]
of video. So it it leads off with, you
know, the machine kind of munching down
this big mulched or this big viny area.
And then it cuts to based in Loveland,
Ohio. And I've got this drone shot of
the big water tower with the with the
branding on that everybody knows about
some kind of, you know, local landmark
that I used.
&gt;&gt; And then it cuts into like a time lapse
of us just crushing through all of this
area. And then it's got just where's
like clear your land fast, you know? So
it's very eye-catching, very
interesting.
&gt;&gt; Quick cut.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, quick cut. I always look at ads
where like I don't think it's cool, then
it's not cool. Nobody's going to like
it, right? So,
&gt;&gt; yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, that's the way that I did. And and
I'm going to be doing a new one soon.
And I'm actually going to be doing a
like an old ' 90s infomercial style. You
know, I'm going to have some dude on a
mower that's like some branch hits him
in the face.
&gt;&gt; Oh, it's like black and white.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.

[26:00]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; It's like the commercial, the Tupperware
commercial where like the woman opens a
cabinet and like 8,000 Tupperware fall.
&gt;&gt; Right. Right. Exactly. except I'm going
to have brush hitting a guy in the face
on his lawn mower because that's the
number one complaint we get is like I
can't mow over there anymore. You know,
this keeps hitting me in the face.
&gt;&gt; So, I'm going to use that as like an
attention grabber. Very overly animated.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Quick question. What if there were
a private community out there of people
that were building businesses based on
this podcast? Well, I just made it and
it's only for business starters and
business builders. It's called TK owners
and it's basically like having me and
100 other business geniuses as your
business partner, but you give them 0%
equity. Also, there's going to be
exclusive new trends, growth hacks,
business ideas, and a database of
everything I've ever talked about.
You'll find thousands of startup case
studies. You'll have weekly ask me
anything with me while I'll answer your
questions directly. You'll be in my
Slack channel where I'm hanging out
every week and helping members
one-on-one. We've got exclusive guest
speakers including some names that

[27:00]
speakers including some names that
you'll recognize. And if you're building
something cool, I'll introduce you to
anyone you need. TK Owners is the
fastest way to plug into a smart,
ambitious group of builders and
accountability partners that are sharing
wins without the fluff. And it's 99
bucks a month, about the cost of an
energy drink per day. You can join now
at tkowners.com. Link in the show notes.
So really like one video ad has been
your stalwart.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean I've run other ones. So I
did a fence line one. So particularly
people looking to clear fence lines.
We've gotten really into the horse
community from that ad we did. The horse
community is a very tight-knit community
and these people all own land, right?
&gt;&gt; So, once you kind of get into that that
community, they start sharing your
information. We get a lot of referrals
from that
&gt;&gt; and their number one issue is keeping
the stuff off of their fence. They need
to be able to walk the horses around the
fence. We did that ad. I tested other
ones, but not for very long. Our bread
and butter has been the the one lead ad.
It is time for it to be changed though,

[28:00]
It is time for it to be changed though,
so it'll be changed because it does
decay over time.
&gt;&gt; Okay. When you say lead ad, you're
keeping them within the meta platform
and you're getting their name, phone,
email.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; And then do you have automation set up
to reach out to them soon as possible?
&gt;&gt; I wish. So we use House Call Pro. They
charge you. It's like $350 a month if
you want access to their API,
&gt;&gt; which is crazy.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You have to go with their max plan. And
I'm like, I don't need anything else on
their Max plan except this API. So,
yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, I haven't set up an automation for
it. I do have like if somebody fills out
our lead form, I do have automation set
up to where it'll send us an email, send
us a message on Telegram,
&gt;&gt; but yeah, I don't have it with House
Call Pro because of their cost of their
API.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I just don't I don't I can't justify it.
&gt;&gt; So, you start getting leads like
immediately. What what does your close
rate end up being?
&gt;&gt; 49% right now.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Oh, wow. It's very high.

[29:00]
&gt;&gt; Oh, wow. It's very high.
&gt;&gt; You can't quite close half of them. It's
too bad.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know. I was at 44% for a while
and then uh I got up to 49 and I'm like,
come on. You just got to get that 50,
you know.
&gt;&gt; And then what is your cost per lead?
&gt;&gt; So cost per lead average $23.
&gt;&gt; Holy cow. And then what's your average
job size by revenue?
&gt;&gt; So it's about 3,100.
So, $46 to convert a $3,100 customer.
&gt;&gt; Yep. That's why it's infinite.
&gt;&gt; That's outrageous.
&gt;&gt; Basically run it to peak market size.
&gt;&gt; That's why Wow. That's why you're booked
out. That's why you're in business.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; That is beautiful. Okay.
&gt;&gt; Also, there's a lot of pent up demand.
That's That is something I think about a
lot is because
&gt;&gt; the CPL will probably go up over time
just because you're you're competing
with yourself, right?
&gt;&gt; Right.
So someone fills out the form, you give
them a call. Is that the process? And
try to get over there or quote it in
person.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So I give them a call, try to set
up a time to quote in person. And it's
pretty easy. Like as soon as I call

[30:02]
pretty easy. Like as soon as I call
them, they know, you know, sometimes
though they fill out the form. They're
like, "Who's this?" They just gave me
their information. But yeah, I'll call
them and then I set up a time on the
schedule to go out and give a quote.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Do you ever try to close over the
phone or have you ever been forced to? I
have closed over the phone. I don't try
to I
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; it's it's
&gt;&gt; the close rate is not as good. I mean
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I I don't know. To me, it's
we're
&gt;&gt; It's an expensive service and people
want to put a face to it.
&gt;&gt; So, to me, it's just I don't know. It
doesn't I don't feel comfortable just
trying to close over the phone. I I have
had customers tell me that there's
another company that's charging for
quotes. They charge $50 to do a quote if
they want them to come out or they'll
just, you know, hey, what's your
property? They'll give them some rough
quote off of a satellite image.
&gt;&gt; And even even well-intentioned
customers, well-intentioned leads that
are interested in your service, can't

[31:01]
are interested in your service, can't
afford it, and don't appreciate that.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, $3,100 average job size. How
many hours does that take on average?
&gt;&gt; 31. I mean, that would be about a day
and a half. So,
&gt;&gt; okay. We have we typically would do by
day, half day, multi-day.
&gt;&gt; 3100 is the average because you get some
that are booking for four days, five
days, some are half days.
&gt;&gt; So that's kind of how you run the
calculus in your mind when pricing is by
half day, day, multiple days.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; I don't love that, but it's for some
reason customers like it. I've tried to
switch to quoting by square acre or
square quarter acre and doing like brush
density, something that's kind of
scalable,
easier to where if I bring another sales
rep in, they're not relying on just
experience of looking at it. It's a very
hardline thing. Even though the pricing
came out to be the same, customers
didn't like it. My close rate dropped in
half for a couple years,
&gt;&gt; and I'm not really sure why. I think

[32:02]
&gt;&gt; and I'm not really sure why. I think
they kind of like that day service where
oh if I can just I could just extend it
another day if I want them to keep
going, you know?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I feel like it's just when it
comes to pricing in any industry, it you
just want to remove friction and
confusion. And if they have to run any
math or numbers in their head, which is
second nature to you because you own the
business in the industry. To them, it's
like if you're there that day, I want to
know what I'm paying for that day. I got
to have you come back. What happens if
you quote like a full day service, call
it 2500 bucks or whatever, and it ends
up taking like two hours? How long did
it take you to learn that? You know,
like, all right, this will take us days.
&gt;&gt; I'm still learning it. U I'm I'm a lot
better now, but that does happen. And I
mean there there's jobs where I quote
them a day, it took us three hours. We
end up charging them a half day or if it
took five hours then it's within that
day scope. So they still pay for a full
day. I've been off before by a couple
days. So I've been short or long a

[33:00]
days. So I've been short or long a
couple days before because it's a large
area.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And sometimes you don't really
know until they start cutting into it
what it actually looks like a 100 feet
back into the woods because a lot of
these you can't even walk through them.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So you've got your cost on the
machine every month. You have your
variable cost for gas which probably
isn't much. You've got a budget for
repairs. I'm sure you're stocking some
away.
&gt;&gt; 15% for repairs.
&gt;&gt; 15% right off the top. Yeah. For
repairs. Other than that, like these
margins seem pretty juicy. Like
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, they're pretty good, actually. So,
yeah, our gross margin is 69.75.
&gt;&gt; Jeez Louise. Okay. Does that include you
putting 15% away for repairs?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Or no. Okay.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, if you're not saving for repairs,
it's 85%.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Just gas and travel cuz you're you're
not really paying employees yet. You've
got an operating partner and he owns

[34:00]
got an operating partner and he owns
equity in the business, right?
&gt;&gt; Right. We are paying for one. So,
&gt;&gt; one employee.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. One.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; So, he's he's gets about 300 a day for a
full day job.
&gt;&gt; Okay. What's the max diameter of these
trees that you're able to mulch?
&gt;&gt; 6 to 8 in depends on the species of
tree.
&gt;&gt; Geez, that's pretty.
&gt;&gt; It's like a really hard wood, it'll be
on the lower side. If it's soft like a
evergreen, be on the higher side.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Now, are you ever having to get
out of the of the skid steer with a
chainsaw and take care of business?
&gt;&gt; No. I mean, we've done it before, but we
typically would tell the customer if
it's too big, they have to tree service.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Do you ever get referrals from other
tree services or do you refer business
to tree services?
&gt;&gt; Uh, yeah, there's uh Yeah, it's all the
time. We actually kind of worked out a
deal with the tree service for a while
um where they would give us like a
commission for referring trees to him. I
think I ended up selling him about 80%
of his schedule.
&gt;&gt; Wow.
&gt;&gt; But he never paid it. He never paid.

[35:01]
&gt;&gt; But he never paid it. He never paid.
&gt;&gt; I could tell in the disgust in your
voice that it's not been a good
experience.
&gt;&gt; So now I don't really refer anybody on
on tree services. I just kind of tell
him like, hey, you know, here's a few
good companies. I could refer a tree
service every other job.
&gt;&gt; Wow. I I come into something where they
want it gone, but it's 20 in wide, you
know, 20 in diameter.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; What about inbound? Are you getting are
you starting to get more inbound calls
and leads? And how has Google business
profile served you?
&gt;&gt; You mean as far as outside of
advertising, like organic? Our organic
has gone up quite a bit. Our organic is
now on our web traffic, it was around
36%.
&gt;&gt; Wow.
&gt;&gt; It's hard. the my ex profile kind of
just took off. So, I'd have to go back
and look at the the data.
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; it's going to have the a weird data
point in there, but yeah, our organic is
growing pretty pretty rapidly. And
that's another reason I turned off ads
because I've only got so much time and I
still have organic leads coming in.

[36:01]
still have organic leads coming in.
&gt;&gt; That's encouraging. A lot of times
people count on organic from day one and
yeah, you just can't you've got to go
out and find the business,
&gt;&gt; right? I did not count on organic at all
because I knew that Google wasn't really
going to serve us up quite yet because
they
&gt;&gt; the forest stream mulching isn't even an
a service on Angie's List or any of
these service sites.
&gt;&gt; So thumbtac and all that that's not even
an option for you.
&gt;&gt; It's not even an option. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Okay. It's a smaller industry. It's very
niche, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But I think it's bigger than most
people realize. But
&gt;&gt; which is why you're doing so well. One
reason, right? You're clearly like just
doing the business well. Like you're you
seem to be running it well. You have
five star reviews.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; This is you, right?
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; It's not it's not easy to have all five
star reviews in in home services, but
&gt;&gt; people ask me all the time like there
are thousands of home service niches and
I always say, you know, look for the
supply demand imbalance. In fact, I did

[37:01]
supply demand imbalance. In fact, I did
a whole hourong YouTube video where I
live streamed myself researching an
industry and I say, "Find something high
ticket." You know, something in the
thousands of dollars range.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm selling expensive service to
wealthy people.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Basically.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; More recession proof that way I kind of
look at it because wealthy people always
have money.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, they do. All right. Let's talk
about your sales numbers from like month
one to 13 to today. What did that look
like? And how seasonal is it? two
questions in one.
&gt;&gt; So the first month, I mean, I pulled up
before it was like 17,000.
Second month was a little higher in the
20s. It's been a while since I looked at
last year, but we only running one
machine then. So we basically maxed out
that one machine around the third month
and then we ran all the way till the end
of November.
So that one machine could do about with
one one person running it, we're doing
about 30,000
per month. until the end of November. It

[38:00]
per month. until the end of November. It
it varies quite a lot for weather.
&gt;&gt; So this year we got the new machine. We
got that middle of May.
So we've only been running two machines
since then. Since middle of May. I
basically we were getting so bugged we
didn't really have a choice. It it was
funny when we were looking at it because
we were like, "Oh my gosh, should we
take the risk and get the new machine?
We'd have to turn up a little
advertising, you know, and then now we
got it and it's like, "Oh my god, I I
could run 10."
&gt;&gt; Well, what's stopping you? Eight more
machines.
&gt;&gt; It takes time to build cash flow, too.
So, we're we're brand new. We're
investing everything we possibly can
back into it. And we'll get another
machine. I think we could probably get
two machines a year or two machines next
year.
&gt;&gt; So, two machines can afford to buy two
more machines next year. And then that
kind of expands from there. The
challenge we have right now is that one
one truck can move two two machines not

[39:01]
one truck can move two two machines not
at a time, but he's going and drops it
off the job site, picks it up, and just
goes to his job site right now. However,
a third machine, it's just not feasible.
You'd have to you'd have to have him not
running equipment at all, just dedicated
to moving equipment around. So ideally
what we need is to get a larger truck,
something that can and a larger trailer
that can haul two machines at once.
&gt;&gt; So that would drastically reduce our
costs on on running equipment around and
our time investment.
&gt;&gt; So which is also
&gt;&gt; your first employee, is that the guy
running the second machine while your
operating partner runs the first?
&gt;&gt; Correct. Yep.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And then we have a part-time operator
that'll help, but it's it's my business
partner's father-in-law. He's he retired
as an equipment operator.
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's perfect.
&gt;&gt; So, he just steps in every now and again
when you know he wants some money.
&gt;&gt; We have a little bit of work for him.
So,
&gt;&gt; Right. What do you pay your employee? Is
it per hour? And if so, what?
&gt;&gt; So, we're try we're paying him on the

[40:01]
&gt;&gt; So, we're try we're paying him on the
day. So, we give him the Okay.
&gt;&gt; So, 300 for the full day.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; We're kind of treating him at this
moment as a subcontractor.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
So that won't be forever though. So
we'll be we'll end up bringing him on.
&gt;&gt; I mean that that's 100 grand a year if
he worked every business day.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; That's not bad. Especially considering
other like harder cuz he's air
conditioned in there, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Air condition.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean if you go does landscaping
or something you'll probably make about
the same if not less
&gt;&gt; and have a much harder
&gt;&gt; joysticks all day basically.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Listening to podcast music.
&gt;&gt; And how let's talk about how fun it is.
Like how fun is land clearing? Like that
is like so enjoyable.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. You know, it's actually
surprisingly rewarding, too. There were
some things that,
&gt;&gt; you know, we had our our very first
customer, she took over her parents'
property. Her parents passed away. The
property had been completely overgrown.
And we cleared it all. And she was just

[41:00]
And we cleared it all. And she was just
like, she just started crying. And I was
like, "Uh, I wasn't expecting that."
She's like, "This is what it used to
look like when I was a kid." You know?
&gt;&gt; Wow.
&gt;&gt; So, like it really brought a lot of
memories back for her to see it. the way
that it used to be.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, it is cool. It's very rewarding.
&gt;&gt; When she started crying, your mind went
from, "Holy crap, why am I in this
business? I really screwed up." to this
is the best business ever.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. It was cool. I was like,
"Wow, I didn't realize it would have
that kind of impact on people." So, but
it does, you know, not most people are
like that, but there's definitely some.
&gt;&gt; So, what are your monthly sales like
today, and what do you project them to
be, or is it just based on how many
machines you have? So last month we did
54,000.
It's been a very very rainy spring. I
think we're like the seventh most like
seventh highest rainfall in recorded
history out here right now. So if it
rains a lot, we we'll sink into the mud
and we won't run. So but we're entering
into the summer months. So we've got
around 70,000 on the schedule for each

[42:01]
around 70,000 on the schedule for each
month up to October. 70,000 next month.
Good for you. You'll do a million next
year,
&gt;&gt; probably. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, video is cool, but you know what's
better? Long form audio via podcast and
my newsletter, tkopod.com.
Go there to subscribe for free to my
newsletter. It's one email a week. Very
tactical. And then go to my audio
podcast. Three episodes a week. Stuff
like this. You're going to love it. All
free. No sleazy sales pitch. tkopod.com.
&gt;&gt; If we get a pretty normal year, you
know, we're projecting to be around
500,000 with two machines. then what's
running nine months. So, however, as we
get more known and especially with these
horse farms and stuff, these horse
farms, they don't care about ruts on
their property. So, you're talking be to
run large jobs all winter as well, which
is something we didn't do our first
year. We just kind of supplemented with
our time with snow clearing.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But,
&gt;&gt; so it doesn't it doesn't have to be
seasonal if you find more horse
customers or the right types of
customers.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. any large farm farm

[43:02]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. any large farm farm
property, you know, they don't really
care about ruts on their property. A lot
of them just want to open it up. They're
going to bush hog it twice a year. But
yeah, any like residential kind of
stuff, they they do typically care if
they've only got four or five acres.
They don't want it torn up. They just
want it opened up so it's usable.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Put 8 inch ruts in people's property,
that's, you know, right problem. Now,
when you when you run like the search
traffic numbers and you look at what
your TAM, your total addressable market
is in your local area without having to
really expand out much to other
metroplexes, what do you think the
ceiling is for your business or or what
like what is the total market share for
the whole industry in your area?
&gt;&gt; We could probably run about 10 10
machines. So, and that's if we took over
a majority of the market share within
our immediate area.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Um, if we started traveling out,
we could do more. We don't target
commercial. We'd get contacted by

[44:00]
commercial. We'd get contacted by
commercial, but there's a lot of
commercial work out there. It's hard for
me to say because it is kind of a a
lesser known industry and it is hard to
get a lot of this data. So,
&gt;&gt; well, if you're doing 2,000 a day per
machine and you're booked five, six days
a week, that's six million a year at
like 70%. Your margin will probably drop
a little bit as you hire more people.
Call it 50 only 50%.
&gt;&gt; That's a $3 million net profit business
in one local market. Like that's
outrageous.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; It's incredible.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; And if anyone's listening in Cincinnati,
don't even think about it. He's going to
crush you.
&gt;&gt; He's just I'm not worried about it. I
want him to start, you know.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I want him to I want it because it
increases the size of the market
entirely.
&gt;&gt; It really does.
&gt;&gt; More people who knows about it. It's
it's a educate the customer kind of
business.
&gt;&gt; Yep. That's a very m like mature
insight. I'm not trying to sound
patronizing, but yeah,
&gt;&gt; it's like the default is to have such
like this limiting mindset. Like Elon

[45:00]
like this limiting mindset. Like Elon
said the same thing about electric cars.
Like bring on the competitors. I need
electric cars to be normalized. You
know, that's what's happened, right?
Like Tesla 10, 15 years ago, they never
thought they would have been selling
Well, he did, but no one else, none of
the analysts thought they'd be selling
millions of cars per year because it was
so niche. They wouldn't be if it weren't
for all of the other electric automakers
out there, you know.
&gt;&gt; Y
&gt;&gt; what a beautiful business. Is there
anything else that you'd like to mention
or talk about that we didn't cover that
people might find helpful or
interesting?
&gt;&gt; So, I had this idea there's a uh a
machine that's called the Green Climber.
I made an expost about it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And
I really want somebody out there because
I'm not going to do it quite yet. I do
want somebody to take on this this
business. So, it's basically a remotec
controlled machine. You know, very low
risk. You just have somebody who's
essentially just operating joysticks
from standing off to the side.
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; It does
&gt;&gt; to the side, not below it. Right.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. A 45 degree angle away from

[46:01]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. A 45 degree angle away from
it. That's the
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But it's relatively affordable. It's on
the expensive side for what you think it
would be. But it does stuff that we
cannot do. So, it'll do like steep
hillsides, ditch lines. It's perfect for
cutting paths. And that's a there's a
lot of work out there for that kind of
stuff, especially commercial where
commercial buildings in particular, they
have stuff that grows up into their
edges of their parking lots and they and
like it's the perfect machine for that.
I think it could be sold doortodoor, you
know, not like selling a pressure
washing service almost.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I really want somebody to do that.
And if they do that, let me know how how
it is. It's just a really cool thing
that I I want I've never seen before and
I don't think anybody does it in the
whole country
&gt;&gt; because you're turning down business
because it's too angled in in places.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's it's too steep for the skid
steer. So, typically what I'll do is
I'll offer them the option of the Green
Climber because I I can rent it

[47:01]
Climber because I I can rent it
&gt;&gt; and it's expensive though. We charge
like 3,000 a day to run the Green CL.
It's a specialized machine.
&gt;&gt; It costs us We have to go pick it up.
Now, the good thing about it is you can
just pull it with a regular truck.
&gt;&gt; It's not like a skid steer where you
need a one- ton truck.
&gt;&gt; And how much does it cost to both rent
and buy?
&gt;&gt; Rental is about a thousand a day to rent
it. Buying See, that's a tough one
because I've asked the the for some
reason these equipment dealers are very
weird about the private about their
pricing. I've been told 150,000 for a
machine and I've been told 70,000 for
the machine.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So huge huge difference, but it
could just be the different machines. I
think the smaller ones around the 70,
the larger ones around the 150.
&gt;&gt; You know what business this reminds me
of? Last summer I interviewed some
teenagers that started a pond cleaning
business and they use expensive
equipment to they go to lakefront homes
that have docks that are just completely
surrounded by seaweed and it looks gross
and their grandkids can't swim in it. A

[48:01]
and their grandkids can't swim in it. A
business that 99% of people didn't know
existed, including myself, until I saw
these guys on Instagram.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. and they they have one expensive
piece of machine, but they're able to
charge ridiculous amounts to go scoop
out and like scrape off the the floor of
the lake all this seaweed. And what I
love about it is they can I like calling
it fish where you know the fish are,
right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; They're only knocking on doors sometimes
literally of homes that are lakefront
and homes that they know that all their
neighbors have the same seaweed. And so
if they can get one customer, they can
get 10. And I see this as very similar
of like, hey, I see this ditch.
Everyone's got this ditch. It's ugly.
It's going to look kind of worse almost
if only one or two people get it done.
&gt;&gt; Oh, it happens all the time. I mean,
what happens? You you clear somebody is
at at the property line
&gt;&gt; and then you you make this neighbor look
brush, right?
&gt;&gt; And then now the neighbors looks
ridiculous.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Because it it's not all just one
congruent area anymore. The the the
neighbor just had it cleared and it
looks so nice. And so then the
neighbors, we end up doing the neighbors

[49:00]
neighbors, we end up doing the neighbors
property. The same thing would be true
with this machine. It just does smaller
stuff, but a majority of the work is in
the smaller stuff.
&gt;&gt; That's a very interesting business. I'm
sure you could get these financed as
well, right?
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Definitely can get these
financed. Yeah, there are other
companies that make uh a similar piece
of equipment, but primarily these are
sold to like city workers or highway
workers where they clear the hillsides
on the edges of the highways. And so I
think that this company in particular,
they they really only ever market
towards government, but the average
person needs this machine as well.
&gt;&gt; And you know, I quote these jobs, but
typically for me, it's it's a larger
hillside. If it's small enough, I'm I'm
kind of like, I don't even want to. It's
not even worth me doing like a half day
on this because I got to rent it. I got
to bring it up.
&gt;&gt; But there's so many little half day,
couple hour things that can be done with
that machine. And you could literally
door knock and sell this. So yeah, you

[50:00]
door knock and sell this. So yeah, you
can put flyers up, you know, it's it's
somebody's going to kill it with that
little machine one day. Yeah, it's just
that nobody's targeted it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that that is some great insight.
Thank you. Well, Alex, this has been
amazing. Where can people find you if
you want them to find you?
&gt;&gt; So, you can uh find us on YouTube. It's
Brushworks Co. on YouTube.
&gt;&gt; Brushworks Co. Okay.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. We're trying to hit to a thousand
subscribers just because it opens up the
next level for us. But
&gt;&gt; well, when we publish this to YouTube,
we'll tag your account and I'm sure we
could get you there.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I appreciate it. And then our
website is brushworksco.com.
&gt;&gt; That's a great name. Okay. All right.
Please let me know in the comments if I
should do more deep dives on sweaty
startups, high ticket home services like
this. I've done one on stump grinding,
junk removal, dumpster rentals, pond
cleaning. I love these industries and
I'll do more if there's demand. Please
share the Kerner office with a friend
and we'll see you next time.
