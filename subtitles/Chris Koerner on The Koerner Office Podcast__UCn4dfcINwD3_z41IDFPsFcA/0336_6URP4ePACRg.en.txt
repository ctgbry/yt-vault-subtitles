my friend Sam installs these ugly stock
tanks for Millennial families here in
Texas here's how much money he makes and
how you can copy him he takes pictures
and videos of each job and posts them to
Instagram Tik Tok and Facebook that gets
him a ton of leads when he gets a job
he'll go to Tractor Supply and buy
either an8 or a 10-ft stock tank the 8
foots are 550 and the 10ts are $850 then
he buys all his pool fittings and
equipment from Amazon for about 350
bucks so he's all in about $1,200 per
pool and he charges about $2,800 and
only takes an hour if the yard needs to
be leveled he'll charge an extra 400 to
$600 to level it out he did about 880
pools last year for $100,000 in Profit
just in the summer he gets about 80% of
his leads from Facebook ads but his
$3500 in ad spend brought him those
$100,000 of profit it's perfect because
Millennials love it to hang in and kids
love it to play in the hard part is
scaling because Tractor Supply will
limit how many pools he can buy from
them so he's working on importing them
in bulk from the manufacturer which will
save him a few hundred full business
