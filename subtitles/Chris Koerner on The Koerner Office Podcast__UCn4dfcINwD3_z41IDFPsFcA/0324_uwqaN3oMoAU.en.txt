look at this freaking thing right here
behind every brilliant craft idea is a
brilliant business idea here's exactly
how I take this cool product and turn it
into a sixf figureure business and how
I'd find customers and then I'll tell
you what all these products are called
so you can go to Home Depot and buy them
I would start by making a few of these
of varying sizes and putting them on my
front porch and hire a professional
photographer and videographer to take
pictures and videos to post in every
local Facebook mom group and on
Instagram that will get you your first
10 or 20 customers I mean come on if
this awesome lady can start a seven fig
porch pumpkin decoration business you
can do the same thing for Christmas this
is even better than the porch pumpkin
business because people spend more money
on Christmas your products aren't super
heavy they don't rot you can reuse them
every year and your gross margins are
90% next step I would document before
and after pictures of every porch I
decorate what would I charge between $3
and $700 depending on the size of the
porch and the value of the home but
here's the kicker I would offer a 10%
discount if they let me take the
products back at the end of the season
this would enable me to recycle them and
the brilliant part is you can take the
cardboard boxes and break them down for
Easy Storage in the off se you can get

Easy Storage in the off se you can get
the wooden dowels from Amazon the pot
that the boxes sit inside are called
resin earn Planters you can get them

are extra cheap if you go to Uline and
get them in both you're looking at about
$150 to 250 per box and some wrapping
paper you've got a business on your
hands follow me for more business ideas
