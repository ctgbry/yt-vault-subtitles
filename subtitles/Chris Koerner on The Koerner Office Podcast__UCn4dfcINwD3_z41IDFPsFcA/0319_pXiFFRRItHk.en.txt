[00:00]
welcome to the ker office I'm going to
do something a little different today if
you go back and listen to episode number
14 and number 21 they are called part
one and part two of every business I've
ever started and I never did a part
three or part four of those so I wanted
to do that but with a Twist I wanted to
take each idea each business that I've
already
started and try to add some ideas of how
you could start a business similar to to
what I did because I firmly believe that
almost any business idea could be
executed at any time certainly sooner is
better bias for Action is a good thing
but most ideas don't just go away or
they don't become too competitive or too
crowded but some of these ideas did only
kind of exist in a vacuum based on what
I was going through at the time so if
that is the case then I'll try to put a
spin on it so you could copy this today
in 2024 or 25 or whenever you're
listening to this so part two of this
series was on May 17th and I finished by
talking about 10 and $20 unlocks which
were domain names $10 unlock.com and $20

[01:02]
were domain names $10 unlock.com and $20
unlock.com that enabled people to unlock
their iPhone so it could sell for more
money and I'll remind you that these are
not in a specific timeline or sequential
order it was as I remembered them and so
the timelines are a little
wonky but the next business this is
number 40 this was the tree Biz boot
camp and so over a year ago we launched
a tree business a tree trimming business
called Fast tree care and we launched it
with James and he's awesome and we
learned a lot about the tree business
and this was the second tree business I
had launched because I had helped a
friend named Jordan launch one about
four years ago so we felt like we knew a
good bit about the tree business and we
wanted to sell a boot camp to teach
others how to start a tree business as
well and we had never done a course or a
mastermind or a boot camp or whatever
you want to call it so this was new to
us I say us this is me and Nick heski my
business partner and so we wanted to do
it in person in Dallas we felt like it

[02:00]
it in person in Dallas we felt like it
would be the highest quality and you
just can't really replace inperson
instruction and so I tweeted about it a
couple times and I sent one email about
it to my newsletter and we got about 20
people about half of them maybe 60%
decided to join in person and the
remaining 40% attended
virtually and so what this was was two
full days of instruction in Dallas
really mckin about 15 minutes from my
house and we taught people how to start
a tree touring business and we had guest
speakers that were marketers and
accountants and James did a bunch of
instruction and Matthew my good friend
SL partner employee that helped with
this business as well we went out to job
sites we showed them different types of
trees in different neighborhoods we
showed them jobs we had already done we
talked about equipment and checklists
and hiring subcontractors because the
whole point of this boot camp was to
start a tree business or any home
service business without performing the
work yourself by Outsourcing all of the

[03:01]
work yourself by Outsourcing all of the
work because we don't own a chainsaw we
just have a truck and then we have Crews
that we$ 99 and subc contract out all
the jobs too so this business was a
success I still have the virtual copy
that every now and then someone will run
across my old tweet and say hey can I
attend that and we say well we're not
doing it in person anymore but you can
buy the virtual version so we still sell
the virtual version every now and then
but the feedback we got on the course
both virtual and in person was amazing
we got like a 9.7 out of 10 Anonymous
feedback score from all the participants
it was really high quality we spent a
lot of money to to make it good and I
think we had like 45 or $50,000 in gross
revenue over a couple days not including
the prep time and about half of that was
profit so about 20 grand profit for two
days worth of work plus a good week's
worth of work U on the front end to plan
things we had really good food we ate at
a good Steakhouse good catered food I
love food so I take it L but anyway that

[04:00]
love food so I take it L but anyway that
was a good business and so you could
start this business by monetizing your
knowledge whatever you know about
business or about life and selling it in
a boot camp or a course or if you come
across someone online that already has
an audience you could piggyback on their
audience and you could put together
content for them and help them launch an
inperson or virtual boot camp and take a
percentage of the revenue so the next
business is fast Tree Care and I kind of
did this in the reverse order but we
started fast treat care in the summer of
2013 me and Nick and James and James was
a hungry college student or recent
graduate from Bowling Green and he moved
to Dallas with nothing but a plan and
hopes and dreams and he stayed at my
house for the first few nights and he's
incredibly hardworking and awesome and
respectful and I gave him my truck my
2011 Tundra to use for the business and
I gave him the Playbook that I used to
help my friend Jordan launch this
business years prior and I said hey call
me if you need anything let's meet in
person every now and then text me call
me here's the plan here's the funding we

[05:01]
me here's the plan here's the funding we
paid him a flat salary every month and
then he went out and did his thing and
he's been doing it ever since and he's
crushing it I love the tree business
because it has what I call a binary
outcome as opposed to a lot of other
Home Service businesses and here's what
that means we get a call for a removal
or a trimming that's basically all we do
with some stump grinding after removal
and it's very clear they need this tree
gone or they need this Branch or
branches gone sometimes multiple trees
some times one we remove them we either
put them by the curb or take them away
depending on how much they pay and then
we get a five-star review uh period and
it's so nice to have a business like
that especially in the context of having
a bunch of other businesses that are so
complex and difficult and nebulous and
you might get a one star review or a
three star review or five star review
you might have Angry customers you have
they're just operationally complex this
one is not because we are subbing out
the work so so in my opinion if you were

[06:01]
the work so so in my opinion if you were
to start a home service business you
should start one with a binary outcome
other examples might be pressure washing
lawnmowing you know what my brain is
failing me I had a whole tweet about
this let me pull that up appliance
repair window cleaning HVAC Plumbing
these are Services where they have a
specific problem and you fix it and
their problem is gone an example of a
business that is does not have binary
outcomes would be like a custom home
building business or a house painting
business oh this isn't the shade that I
chose or this shade looks different in
the Sun or you missed a spot or how much
primer did you use or there's just so
many things that a customer could be
dissatisfied by and it makes your job a
lot harder so that is a framework I love
and I wouldn't have that framework if if
it weren't for fast treat care because
we had an a third-party logistics
company we had an e-commerce company and
those are very very hard to do a good
job and they don't do not have a binary
outcome okay next one this is blue

[07:00]
outcome okay next one this is blue
metric blue metric is the company that I
am a co-p general partner for that buys
RV parks and campgrounds around the
southeast I didn't start this business
so maybe this shouldn't be on the list
so this is somewhat of a stretch well
it's not a stretch at all to say that I
started it because I did not start it
but it was a new Endeavor for me at
least it is very entrepreneurial I have
to go out and find potential investors
that are interested in these parks and
then sell them on it I also have the
task of helping to find the parks um
using my audience to find off-market
deals I also help write investor updates
and help with marketing this takes
decent chunk of my time today and it's
one of the few ideas here that I'm still
doing because I've only been doing it
for about a year now in this business I
am compensated by investors that I bring
into a deal it's not a fund in the sense
that we raised one big amount and then
we're using that amount to buy a bunch
of parks it is a syndication in the
sense that we raise one to $8 million at

[08:00]
sense that we raise one to $8 million at
a time on a park by- park basis and so
if I raise a million dollar of a deal
then I get a small percentage of that
deal in equity over time and then I also
get a small percentage of our
acquisition fee at the closing table so
this is a great Endeavor because it
enables me to have some free cash flow
um every month or every couple months as
we close parks and also build my net
worth by establishing Equity Stakes
small Equity Stakes in these parks
around the country number
43 was a company called busy and in the
early days of co-founders when our
thesis was to partner with college
students or recently graduated college
students I partnered with a guy named
Sam out of BYU Sam is an awesome guy I
hope he's listening to this right now
and we started a company called Busy B
iy use busy.com was the website I think
it's still live we're not still actively
running this but I think the domain name
is still live
and busy aggregated businesses for sale

[09:02]
and busy aggregated businesses for sale
around the internet from dozens of
different websites we scrape them and
then we put them all together we put
them in a Google sheet and then we email
them out once a week so this was never
monetized and there are quite a few
other companies doing this in a much
cleaner way they're striving to be the
Zillow for buying businesses we did this
in a much more low Tech way for people
that are more data nerds and want to see
everything in one place where they could
sort and filter and crunch numbers but
what's cool is that people actually
acquired businesses from these lists
that we sent out and we never charged
anything for it it was just kind of an
experiment and we thought ah let's
monetize this one day but we kind of
shut this down because Sam got another
internship and I was juggling 1,800
things at the same time and it's just
one of those many things that we never
monetized and there wasn't really a
clear path to monetization there's lots
of ways you could monetize you could
charge a percentage referral fee from
the brokers for referring them a buyer

[10:02]
the brokers for referring them a buyer
or you could charge a monthly fee it
could be a SAS product more broadly
speaking we slowly just started drifting
away from ideas that did not have a
clear monetization path now our thesis
at co-founders is to only start or buy
things that can cash flow very quickly
we don't care about building a ton of
equity we just want free cash flow as
soon as possible for the least amount of
dollars invested so if you wanted to
start something like this pick an
industry pick an industry that is highly
distributed and aggregate data for that
industry into one place and send it out
to people that are invested either
literally or on a Time basis more
specifically I think there's a massive
opportunity for anyone listening that to
this to reach out to Main Street
business owners right maybe it's a
restaurant owner maybe it's a dentist
maybe it's a SAS company in a in a small
town in the Midwest and to find owners

[11:00]
town in the Midwest and to find owners
that are interested in selling their
business and then to connect them with
highly competent business brokers for a
25% referral fee because business
brokers charge 5 to 10% 10 is not
uncommon for a good business broker so
let's say you you built this HVAC
company to $500,000 in profit per year
you want to sell it for $2
million it took you 30 years to build
this you sell it for $2 million a broker
is going to take 200 Grand of that as
his fee to find a buyer
but if you connect that broker with the
business owner you can take 50 Grand of
that up to right 25% is like the top of
the market but most legitimate good
business brokers are willing to pay
between 10 and 25% of their fee if you
bring them a client now the hard part
about this business
is the sales cycle is so long it takes
weeks or months or
years for a business broker to get a
listing under contract and then it could
take weeks months or years for it ever

[12:01]
take weeks months or years for it ever
to sell and it's common for deals to
fall out of the pipeline like picture
home sales times 10 on a difficulty
scale and timeline nevertheless this is
a huge opportunity playing Matchmaker
between Brokers and sellers so that is
the idea that I would execute today if I
were you next business number 44 no
greasy no greasy is a website I'm very
proud of I think the domain name is
still live the idea is to sell a very
high quality restaurant Degreaser in
powdered form to restaurant owners I
love the idea of selling something to
gas station owners or restaurant owners
because there are hundreds of thousands
of either one I was talking to a friend
one day who has a business in a
different field and they started selling
this powdered Degreaser to restaurants
which wasn't their core product or
service and this powdered Degreaser was
so good the restaurants were loving it
they're used to buying Degreaser in
liquid form so they have to pay for all
that shipping of water which is
unnecessary instead he was selling a
powdered form to them much more highly

[13:01]
powdered form to them much more highly
concentrated and they can put it in a
spray bottle add water and it was very
very potent and so I was able to find
the manufacturer of this powdered
decreaser and we placed samples at like
50 plus restaurants by texting the
restaurant owners and saying hey we have
the best degreaser you'll ever find we
sent them a sample and then we tried to
get them to order we did this was James
and I actually James from Fast treat
care we did this together before we did
Fast treat care and we had some success
we sold some Degreaser and the margins
are really good and if you go to the
website nog grey.com I'm proud of this
website because I worked really hard at
the copywriting I know that a rest I've
been in the restaurant industry a bunch
before I ever started business as a
teenager and as a college student I
worked in restaurants as a bus boy and
as a server and restaurant owners the
culture of restaurant owners is they're
a little irreverent you could say and so
I made the copy on the website
reflective of that and it's funny I
think it's funny but I wrote it so I'm

[14:01]
think it's funny but I wrote it so I'm
biased but I'm a firm believer that good
copyrighting can really really sell this
opportunity is still out there for
anyone to crab it's a beautiful business
because it's recurring if you find the
best degreaser in the world you're going
to buy it every month what's hard about
this business is that restaurant owners
are used to buying all of their supplies
from one to two sources there's two or
three massive companies out there US
Foods in Cisco in particular that sell
food and supplies to go containers
cleaning supplies degree sir so the hard
part is breaking restaurant owners out
of that pattern from ordering everything
from the same place it's possible but
it's hard so if you're a restaurant
owner or you know a restaurant owner or
the owner of a chain of restaurants send
them to nogg grey.com or send them to me
Chris co-founders decom and maybe we'll
sell them some really good degrees here
because we still have access to it and
it's a great product but if you're
listening to this and you want to start
something here then find find something
you can sell to restaurant owners you

[15:01]
you can sell to restaurant owners you
can get them on the phone by calling
them before 10:00 a.m. or between 2: and
4:00 p.m. when it's less busy now it's
still busy because they're prepping for
the next shift but it's less busy in the
sense they're not juggling a ton of
customers but it's a great business even
though they have low margins even though
the failure rate is high it's a great
business because the reorder rate is
super duper high sell them something
that they're buying anyways that is a
superior product the next one is lead
texter lead text can you imagine what
lead texter does it was a lead
generation service that I launched with
my friend Jared in 2019 2020 or so and
we would help home service business
owners find more leads roofers in
particular and we found them leads by
texting and then selling them the leads
and this was a great business and it
worked but the difficult part about this
business are the regulatory hurdles you
can't text people that don't opt in you
can't text people that are on the Do Not
Call List it's tough to get around these
things there are some ways similar to
cold emailing you can't just add someone
to your newsletter but you can cold

[16:01]
to your newsletter but you can cold
email someone so we did find some ways
around this but we were concerned about
the scalability of it so in general I
would apply this business today by just
looking at Cold SMS as a different
marketing channel that you might be
ignoring today because the open rates
are what 97% as opposed to 20% on email
the response rates are double digits as
opposed to you know 5% for email more
broadly speaking I'm very bullish on the
home service industry and in selling
marketing services to them because a lot
of Home Service businesses are busy
they're doing great they're doing fine
so you'd think well they don't even need
marketing Services why would I start a
marketing business because the ones that
are in that sweet spot they're not too
big to have a hard time finding the
owner but they're big enough to where
they want to scale and they have the
infrastructure to scale and they have
the budget to pay $1 to $4,000 a month
to get more more business those guys are
ready to be sold to and when the economy
turns whenever that happens people are

[17:00]
turns whenever that happens people are
going to have to get a lot more creative
to find more jobs and you'll be able to
fill that need we have a kind of a
stealth is Project going on right now
called repeat leads where we're doing
this we're helping home service business
owners find more leads and we're having
a ton of success and it's been a great
business so far and they've been very
happy with us so the pie is big enough
for everyone there's over 30 million
small businesses in America alone that's
10% of all Americans on paper that means
one in 10 people you pass on the street
are is a potential customer more
realistically speaking most of those
business owners don't even have any
employees so they don't have a budget
for something like this but there are
certainly millions of potential
customers out there Google business
profile management Google LSA management
paid Google ads paid Facebook ads lead
magnets we talk about this stuff all the
time on this podcast all right if you
are watching this clip right now you are
watching this on YouTube and if you are
a fan of podcast please check out my
podcast while you're at it because
sometimes I have podcasts that aren't

You'll see the link and we'll see you
there number 46 easy MLS easy MLS was a
flat fee MLS listing service for people
that had already listed their homes for
sale by owner so we built an automation
my friend Jared and I that would
automatically text Andor email fsbo for
sale by owner Sellers and say hey no one
can see that your properties for sale I
know you're trying to save 6% I respect
that I'm a cheapo too but for 100 bucks
you could list this on the MLS with us
now you're still probably going to want
to pay 1 to 3% to the buyer agent but to
get 10 times more eyeballs on your
listing by getting it on Zillow on the
right category on Zillow and on red fin
you're going to want this to be listed
on the MLS do it with us for a flat fee

[19:01]
on the MLS do it with us for a flat fee
for 99 or $3.99 it was low hundreds of
dollars and it was automated it was
beautiful and so people would get an
automated text then they could
automatically pay and then they would
automatically get a type form to submit
their description and their pictures and
today you could do this with AI you
could have ai write the listing for them
you could remove 80% of the friction
which was the big problem with this
business five years ago with all the
friction that it takes sure you get them
to pay great but they're not going to
get any value out of the product if they
never take the time to take professional
pictures and to list the pictures and to
write a description and to think of a
description and to answer the phone when
people call it's a lot to ask in
exchange for only $1 to $400 the price
that you charge is not reflective of the
friction they have to go through to use
your service and to have a good
experience that was the big Pro problem
with it but today you could use AI to do
most of this work for them so I'm much
more bullish on this idea today than I
was when I launched it four or five

[20:01]
was when I launched it four or five
years ago number 47 my favorite number
this was I just have rocking chair
because one day I was shopping on bis
byell and here's a great framework for
you if you're short on ideas not just
ideas of what business to to buy but
what business to start if you're short
on ideas then just start window shopping
on Biz by sell because there are a
plethora of ideas tactical financials
everything you want you'd ever want to
see about a small business is listed on
bis byell don't just look in your market
look
Nationwide go to bis byell and look at
the homepage before you even log in
because those are going to be really hot
listings that bis byell is putting in
front of you because other people are
naturally clicking on them and seeking
them out that's another good framework
is on any platform that is somewhat
sophisticated like a Twitter or any
social media platform or a big website
if you really want to see what's hot
check it out in an incognito tab or when

[21:01]
check it out in an incognito tab or when
you're not logged in and it will show
you like the most popular things really
really good for generating ideas so
anyway I was on bis byell one day and I
see this business for sale in Texas that
was an e-commerce business that made
these old-timey wooden rocking chairs
rocking horses actually where it would
be just like a horse head combined with
kids rocking chair and someone in Texas
was making these and selling them and
their margins were like 70% they were
selling a ton of them and I got the info
packet from the broker and they had
insane margins and they were getting
100% of their business from Paid
Facebook ads which is both bad and good
it's bad because it's only one channel
to receive all your customers it's good
because insert $1 get back six or
whatever it is and so what I did was I
tried to reverse engineer this to see if
I could recreate the Facebook ad success

[22:01]
I could recreate the Facebook ad success
that they were having because I thought
man I might not start a rocking horse
business but I could sell a similar
product to a similar demographic AKA
mom's age 25 to 45 at a similar price
point and so I did so I put up a website
and I took some pictures from Google
images and I started pushing paid
Facebook ads to it to see if they would
convert and then if they converted I
would just refund their money and said
say hey this is just a test I'm just
trying to I'm trying to test something
here and it worked I was I was able to
acquire customers now this was I don't
know how long ago this was six seven
years but more broadly speaking what you
could learn from this is go to Biz by
sell see what people are doing request
an info packet and just learn read the
synopsis read the executive summary look
at the financials and think where is the
asymmetric bet is there something here
that shows there's more demand and
Supply is there something here that has

[23:01]
Supply is there something here that has
outsized margin something that just
surpris you makes you kind of sit up on
the edge of your chair and go huh this
is interesting and then take that data
and do something with it okay the next
one is this the Kerner office podcast
newsletter I've had my newsletter for a
little over a year now I'm on Edition
number 55 or 56 and it is weekly so it's
a little over a year and the podcast I
launched in late February of this year
2024 and it is a business I'm monetized
by YouTube YouTube pays me between I've
been monetized for almost three months
exactly on YouTube and it's climbing I'm
make between 50 and $150 a day which is
awesome it's like two to three grand a
month not life-changing for me but it's
sizable it's significant that's a
vacation every couple months for my
family if I wanted it to be really I'm
just putting it back into equipment I'm
using a $300 camera right now which is
quite cheap as far as cameras are
concerned I'm using $59 lighting from

[24:00]
concerned I'm using $59 lighting from
Amazon which you might be able to tell
if you're watching this on YouTube I'm
cheap and sometimes to a fault literally
to a fault because I could have a higher
quality production here if I spent more
on equipment but I'm starting to use
that YouTube Revenue to pay for more
editing I'm going to do more inperson
one-on-one style interviews ride alongs
diving deep into Home Service businesses
with the home service business on site
kind of like a dirty jobs meets Diners
Drive-Ins and Dives with better hair
hopefully in this case but I've never
had a paid ad on the newsletter or the
podcast not to say that I never will I'm
just very very very picky and I turn
down almost everything that comes my way
because I don't want to just shill
things on behalf of people just because
they happen to give me money I value
your time and attention just like I turn
down most people that want to have a
zoom with me I wouldn't blame anyone
else that does the same with me time is
the only thing we can't buy back and
so if I feed you guys irrelevant dumb
ads then I'm wasting your time and

[25:02]
ads then I'm wasting your time and
that's not fair to you so I love running
this podcast I love business as you can
tell I could do this until I die because
it is my hobby and my profession and my
passion it's everything rolled up into
one And So It comes naturally to me so
the business idea for you here is talk
about what you're doing go do cool
things and then talk about it on the
Internet or on a podcast very few people
will care or listen at first but the
better you get at portraying those ideas
either through copywriting or through
the spoken word the more people will be
interested and share it with their
friends my next business is Consulting I
do advising every now and then very
rarely with business owners we speak
once a week they pay me on a monthly
basis and I help them grow their
business and or operationalize it this
is a tricky one because it can be decent
money but often times it doesn't give me
a lot of energy because there are so
many things that I want to be working on

[26:01]
many things that I want to be working on
in my businesses my passion is zero to
one not just business like I just said
in the last segment but specifically the
zero to one phase of business going from
idea to execution to first dollar in the
stripe account I love that and so if I'm
helping other people do that that's
enjoyable but it's not as enjoyable as
doing it myself and so I I say no to
almost every opportunity that comes my
way but nevertheless it is a source of
revenue for me even today I haven't been
doing for that long but it is really
cool to see a business owner Implement
an idea that I give that I give them and
then see the fruits of that come to life
so the next business is called speed to
ship and this is a domain name that I
still own
today and it is a piece of software that
my brother-in-law Justin developed for
both my old company send eats which was
a thirdparty logistics company and for
my current company Texas snacks which is
our bues resale business so we had a
very specific software need with Texas

[27:01]
very specific software need with Texas
snacks and we wanted to rate shop as in
we wanted to scan a package and then put
it on the scale and then we wanted a
piece of software to tell us okay
between UPS FedEx DHL and USPS here is
maybe not the cheapest but here's the
best shipping option All Things
Considered so for instance maybe the
person pays for overnight but they're
already in Texas so we don't want to pay
for a $25 overnight label we would
rather pay for a $6 label because we
know that they're going to get it
overnight you also have packages with
dimensional weight now you've got weight
and dimensional weight let's say you're
shipping a balloon it weighs almost
nothing but the dimensional weight is
quite big so this software takes that
into consideration so I still think that
this is an amazing piece of software
that we should be selling a lot of times
the best businesses are built within
another business to solve that
business's specific need and then you
learn oh wow this actually could be res
sold to other businesses so we're not

[28:00]
sold to other businesses so we're not
reselling speed to ship we don't even
have a mechanism for that but we
actually have a couple big competitors
today that are doing the same thing but
at the time we developed this no one was
doing this and it changed the game we
saved thousands of dollars a month on
shipping so credit to Justin for
building this and for maintaining it
because we're still shipping thousands
of packages a month through this just
for Texas snacks but one day we need to
resell this as a SAS product to other
e-commerce businesses so if you own a
business look for the problem that
you're having develop a solution for
them and then start seeing if other
business owners have the same problem
okay the next is Mexican baseball about
a year ago I got approached by a guy in
LinkedIn that said hey I read your Bucky
story and I think it's awesome and I'm
connected with many of
the baseball team owners here in Mexico
and believe it or not baseball is the
second biggest most popular sport in
Mexico behind
soccer and it's growing even faster than
there's a winter league and a summer

[29:00]
there's a winter league and a summer
league and millions of Mexicans watch
baseball and he thought wow why is there
no mlb.com for Mexican baseball the
individual teams have websites where you
can buy the merch but there is no
central place that sells all the merch
so he wanted my help in creating this
and in promoting this and so we talked
for a while about it we're still in
touch we wanted to launch before the
last season but we ran out of time and
so this is still kind of a work in
progress if anyone's going to do this
it's this guy that reached out to me
because he's so well connected he owns a
team himself and then he's connected to
the other team owners as well and then
he's also connected to one of the major
sports streaming companies so there's
another opportunity to stream this these
Mexican baseball games as well so how
could you copy this idea I have no idea
I'll be honest maybe find another
country that has a sport that's growing
quickly try to find a decision maker
there and do the same thing next one is
better Parks better Parks is the entity

[30:00]
better Parks better Parks is the entity
that Nick and I started to buy an RV
park now this RV park is outside
entirely of blue metric the parks that
I'm raising money for this was just mine
and Nick's thing and it's a park in Waco
Texas and we started better Parks as an
entity to buy this RV park turn it
around and one idea that we had for
better Parks was to be kind of a
consulting firm that helps other RV
parks increase their occupancy where we
would come in and say hey we'll make all
these changes for you we'll convert Park
owned homes to 10 owned homes we'll be
the bad guy that raises rents we'll
install cameras we'll do all these
things and you pay us one flat fee or we
get a percentage of equity in the park
we never ended up going through with
that so this entity is just used for
that Park in Waco which we successfully
turned around but then had issues with
the city and we are trying to sell the
park right now because it has been a
headache to be honest so we are selling
the park with all of the issues with the
city front and center and Our Deck
saying hey this isn't something we want

[31:00]
saying hey this isn't something we want
to manage right now so we're willing to
take a hit on it for you to manage this
product this project and capture the
upside so how could you copy this buy an
RV Park start an RV park easier said
than done obviously I don't recommend
building an RV park especially if it's
your first 4A into the game but
obviously firmly believe they are great
Investments which is why much of my time
is spent raising money and investing in
RV
parks next idea is busy juice so if
you're an OG to the Pod you've probably
heard me talk about busy juice in the
past maybe you even saw a video of me on
YouTube with a massive one gallon
stainless steel container with a busy
juice.com sticker on the side busy juu
is a drink that I invented to fill a
need my own need I wanted to drink a
gallon of water a day I also wanted
caffeine but I didn't want to drink a
gallon of garbage I was drinking moo
like that little drink enhancer you get
from the grocery store the squirt
bottles I was drinking a gallon of water

[32:00]
bottles I was drinking a gallon of water
a day and mixing in moo so it wasn't
just boring old water then I thought
geez I should not be drinking a gallon
of red dye number 40 a day this is this
cannot be good under any circumstances
and so I started ordering products to
make my own drink a drink where I knew
what the ingredients were and it would
give me energy and would hopefully not
kill me and that was busy juice and it
has three ingredients and I drink it to
this day every day and it gives me
energy and it's clean and I know what's
in it and one day I'm going to resell it
and so I put up a website I bought the
domain name busy juice.com and I put up
a a landing page but there's nothing for
sale yet and this is a physical product
it's an industry I have very little
experience in developing a physical food
product and so it's just on the back
burner right now but one day I will make
this and I will sell it and it's in
powdered form so it's not expensive to
ship it's obviously a crowded category
but I don't care because guess what we
all need to drink liquids every day to
survive so I don't care how many
competitors I have if it's a superior or

[33:01]
competitors I have if it's a superior or
a decent product people will buy it and
if they like it they will keep buying it
every month until they get sick of it so
the last business that I will cover
today and then I'll do a part four and
that will be the last segment but the
last one is Sunbeam ABA Sunbeam ABA was
my attempt to buy an autism clinic with
my two good friends and business
partners Stephen and Nick we found an
autism clinic to buy in Tucson Arizona
we spent a lot of money what 12 Grand
putting paperwork together to acquire
this business we flew out to Tucson
which no offense to anyone that lives in
Tucson but it's not a great place and we
met with the business owner we took him
out to dinner we spent a couple days
with him it's great business after
flying there we decided yeah yeah we
really want to buy this but there were a
lot of red flags during the due
diligence process the owner was not
willing to disclose all of his
financials he was really dodgy about

[34:00]
financials he was really dodgy about
some things it was difficult the owner
was being really difficult and we didn't
feel comfortable with it and we were
going to raise money to buy this based
on a tweet that I put out there in the
world based on information that Stephen
gave me about an autism clinic deal that
he did while working for his last
employer and so I tweeted about this it
got 500,000 views received a ton of
interest from accredit investors I put
together a list we had a couple webinars
we basically had the money raised we had
the deal targeted but the deal fell
through because it didn't look good and
then we lost energy on the deal you know
time kills all deals and we moved on so
we never raised money we never bought an
autism clinic we thought seriously about
starting one we looked at another one in
Texas to buy a much smaller one but it
just never came together and so we took
that energy and interest and ended up
putting it into our pet cremation
business so I guess this is kind of a
two-part mini segment to end this
segment sunbe pause all right Sunbeam
the name came from a song that we have

[35:02]
the name came from a song that we have
in our church which is called Jesus
wants me for a Sunbeam and so we were
optimistic with our autism clinics that
we would be able to help children with
autism treatment plans and so we named
the entity after a children's song as
part of our religion so we kept the name
Sunbeam and instead of Sunbeam ABA it
was Sunbeam
pause and we launched it we now own a
pet cremation business in the greater
DFW area and this is a great business
because it's very operationally light we
have a refrigerated van and we pick
up deceased animals mostly dogs some
cats some
hamsters and we deliver them to a
cremation facility so we're basically
the logistics provider between the
veterinary clinics and The Cremation
provider and it's profitable it's been
profitable from day one and we're
working on acquiring more C customers
right now customers being veterinary
clinics in the DFW area so that

[36:03]
clinics in the DFW area so that
concludes this third part of every
business I've ever started I think I'll
change the name because you're more
likely to listen to it if it's more
relatable to you but if you found this
interesting please share with a friend
leave me a five star rating and I will
see you next time
