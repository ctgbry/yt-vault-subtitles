[00:00]
I literally quit my great office job to
learn how to build fences I joined a
crew and I was making 15 bucks an hour
the magic is where you find low barrier
to entry plus really ugly manual labor I
came across the idea of a stock tank
pool I just loved how it looked so I put
one in my backyard I could probably sell
some of these I like to call this a
piggyback model you see a new Walmart
opens and a Game Stops right in front of
it if you don't have $100,000 for an
inground pool this is super easy I was
buying so many of them from Tractor
Supply from other feed stores I'd buy
out their inventory in a few days
welcome to the ker office you are going
to love this episode because it's a
hybrid episode I've never done one like
this I found an entrepreneur that's a
lot like myself that started multiple
things and went deep in all of them so
today you get the benefit of three deep
Dives in one episode from the same
person Sam did a fencing SL pergola
business so we went into that he has a
stock tank installation business where
people can spend you know two to five
grand to install an 8 to 10 foot
diameter stock tank in their backyard

[01:01]
diameter stock tank in their backyard
that's perfect for Millennials just
hanging out or kids this is a booming
industry that most people would never
believe or maybe even think should exist
but it's very profitable and anyone
could do this and then lastly but
certainly not least Sam talked about his
sauna cold plunge business which is
inside of someone else's gym that's
grossing over 10 grand a month and is a
really unique concept that you're going
to love three deep Dives one episode one
awesome entrepreneur Named Sam please
share with a friend and we'll see you
next time Sam tell us who you are and
what you do yeah so my name is Sam unart
I'm from Fort Worth Texas essentially
went to school at Texas Tech got a great
normal job after college I worked for a
company named Alcon for four or five
years and always found myself wanting to
own my own business you know I had that
entrepreneur mindset I could tell from
from the start I just wasn't happy in my
in my corporate job so four or five
years went by and basically I I decided

[02:01]
years went by and basically I I decided
I wanted to get in the construction
industry I had some friends who were
homebuilders and both commercial and
residential construction and basically I
wanted to learn from the ground up so I
literally quit my great office job to
learn how to build fences so I joined a
crew and I was making you know 15 bucks
an hour just burning through my savings
and I wanted to learn how to do the work
myself and then start my own fencing
company essentially did you tell them
that or were you just like I'm looking
for a job
I told when I was being hired because
the guy looked at me like you know I was
probably overdressed for the interview
and like yeah I mean Sam you're wearing
a Patagonia event right now let's go
come on I and I had like you know I have
a college degree on my resume he's like
you know what what you applied for and I
was like yes sir I do I'll be upfront
with you you know I want to learn how to
do it myself because I want to open up
my own business and he said you know we
need the help and I'm happy to you know
very open he we helped me on the
business side as well you know if I ask
questions he would answer it he did not

[03:00]
questions he would answer it he did not
see me as competition and which was
great yeah I mean I worked for him for 6
months and literally was out digging
holes you know driving a trailer around
and in the spare time when I was in the
truck with my boss I'd ask him questions
about the business side of things and
learn the business that way did you tell
them you wanted to start a fencing
business or home service or any business
I said fencing so I told them I had
buddies who were home builders and that
you know my goal is basically to learn
the business get a crew together and
then get some contracts through them and
he did more Custom Fencing some
elaborate Gates like nice Ranch fences
so maybe that's why he wasn't too
threatened but also just the market I
mean there's there's more work than than
workers so that's what I told him I told
him from the very start and what was it
about fencing that turned you onto it a
conversation you had with a home builder
or yeah my home builder buddies you know
one the contracts they sign them for the
entire neighborhood so you get 60 houses
all at once so that's a good thing and a

[04:00]
all at once so that's a good thing and a
bad thing because they expect the work
to be done you have a short window once
the house is done to run the fence but
also it's low barrier to entry you can
YouTube how to build a fence and after
an hour or two you can feel most people
can feel pretty comfortable doing a
fence in their backyard doesn't require
a lot of crazy power tools you know it's
not you're not framing a house you're
not Plumbing doing electrical work it's
digging holes setting posts and screwing
in fin Sports essentially it's kind of
given me a framework as you talk about
about it like I'm opening a sheet right
now to take note of this so of like low
barrier to entry like on the surface is
like oh that's bad because I'm gonna
have a lot of comp competitors but it's
good because you can get in easily right
but I think the magic is where you find
low barrier to entry plus like really
ugly manual labor that's like the the
magical sweet spot like I interviewed
these guys that have a a pond cleaning
business and the barrier to entry is
buying a $20 rake from Home Depot nobody
wants to like go waste deep in a pond

[05:01]
wants to like go waste deep in a pond
step on a snapping turtle and like rake
weeds up and like lift them up that are
water logged and put them on the shore
like nobody wants to do that so it's a
great business yep it sounds like
fencing yep it is and I mean after a
week I could pretty much build like
three different types of fences pretty
comfortably like I I knew how to do it
myself so it's it's very it's very quick
and easy but you hit it you hit the nail
on the head like who wants to go out
there and dig holes to set post you're
working with concrete bags it's heavy
it's bulky you know you're driving a
trailer all around DFW which is like Mad
Max with traffic out there so it's not
fun but it's easy to get started it's
just hard to stick with it but there's a
lot of money in it so did you launch the
the fence business and if so how did it
go I got burned out on fencing I did
like woodworking so I switched to sort
of pergolas and decks so same concept
outdoor woodworking and I did do that
for I'd say not not even a year I'd say
six to 8 months

[06:00]
six to 8 months
did you start the fence business or did
you get burned out while working the job
I got burned out while I was on the job
and I said I am go start a business but
I don't want to just focus on fencing
yeah you saw you saw too much I guess so
yeah I saw too much also having more
conversations with my home builder
buddies they talked about you know we'll
give you the business but here's what we
expect and I would have to get you know
it'd be zero to 100 I mean I'd have to
have like five Crews all at once okay
and I was more wanting to just you know
have myself and one or two Crews and
we're starting on these small jobs to
get my feet running and if I let my you
know this my good friend from childhood
I don't want to say yes do this and let
him down and cause drama so so so it's
not just like the conversation opened
your eyes to it the conversation was
like you go do this and I'll sub my jobs
out to you because I don't have a good
fencing guy I need a good fencing guy
exactly exactly and then it when push
came to shove it's like he's like okay
here's a job go hire five Crews you're
like whoa this is risky this is

[07:02]
like whoa this is risky this is
dangerous it essentially he he got a
bigger neighborhood than we originally
thought he got and he also got a
promotion so I mean he was over like a
subdivision now wow three or four
neighborhoods in there and in order to
beat the current bid like this guy's
been doing it for a while and it just it
was just too big you know I'd be it'd be
I could have done it but it'd be yeah
yeah so you still you still really like
the business especially if you start
small and yeah you know start getting
residential jobs and that's completely
different from like all right here's a
here's a subdivision yeah for your first
job you know and these subdivisions they
nickel and dime I me they they give the
offer to it's really really cheap which
I didn't like as well so there's still I
mean it's always in my back pocket I
think to go and do the the private jobs
and the the nicer Ranch jobs you know
those sort of things but those
subdivision those home builders I mean
they don't mess around and it's such a
tight the way home building works you
know the frame goes and the it goes and

[08:00]
know the frame goes and the it goes and
there's like a three or 4 day period
where the fence needs to be done and
that's times 100 homes so you're on
their time having to you know I got to
do a fence on this street okay now we're
waiting a day now 40 homes just opened
up now you need five Crews activated
some weeks just need one activated so
that sounds crazy it's a crazy thought
so that that pushed me back but I went
and started building pergas and Pera
business yeah let's talk about that
which low barried entry somewhat there's
you have to have some carpentry skills
you have to pull permits from the city
it's a lot more you know detail planning
than a fence which I like I like
woodworking so I fit right in I have
that mindset of you know I know how to
do the marketing I know how to run ads
acquire customers and I also know how to
you know saw cut design a Pergola
structurally so it's safe work with you
know electrici to wire in ceiling fans
things like that so I did that for six
months and how did that go how did you
find your jobs what were your margins

[09:01]
find your jobs what were your margins
like I did Yelp ads I ran ads on Yelp I
signed up for Angie's List you know all
the basics Google ads put videos out
there on social media I have a somewhat
I think I do like unbiased obviously but
a creative side on social media so I'm
pretty good at filming the progress like
the Tik Tok style when it comes to
construction so I did that and you know
once you get one or two of those jobs
and get some content you know I just
really reuse that content film it from
different angles to build a portfolio
and then slowly surely jobs started
coming in for
pergas I I did for six months I probably
did eight to 10 jobs and they were all
you know when when I say perlot it's a
wooden struct it's just wood I mean it's
it's Cedar Wood I'm not putting brick
I'm not putting siding windows it's just
a structure to put shade over a patio
essentially what's an average job size
like both top and bottom line yeah so it
cost it's really just wood and some
screws and materials cost you anywhere
from 3 to

[10:00]
from 3 to
4,000 and then I was charging anywhere
from eight to 10,000 are you buying a
kit or is this all custom this is just
from a lumber yard and they they would
deliver it and Wood's so expensive
Lumber's so expensive especially Cedar
Wood some of these post cost $400 for
one and you know multiply that by six
and then you got you know wood running
on top and wood running to the side and
it adds up quick and then the hardware
is another four or 500 bucks so Wood's
expensive especially Cedar were you
doing it yourself or did you have a a
crew both so I started with myself and
then I had a buddy that whatever he was
off work he'd come help me we do I think
we did five or six ourselves and then I
was at Lowe's and I saw a guy loading up
a bunch of wood in his trailer and I
just said hey you know do you build
perlos he said yep followed me to the
job site said yeah we can do this for X
number of dollars I said let's go P what
did he charge you it wasn't unreasonable
I mean I was probably making you know

[11:02]
I mean I was probably making you know
before I would make 5,000 I was probably
I probably paid him like 2,000 in labor
you didn't have to do it I didn't have
to do it yeah it was the best day of my
life not having to do it you know okay I
loved doing it but Texas it was he of
Texas summer other things going on it's
near impossible to run the business side
and do the work yourself unless you're a
mad man so is that kind of why you got
out of it no so started I built a few
decks as well wooden decks and someone
said hey do you install above ground
pools not to go off another tangent
that's another whole business is just
installing above ground pools those come
in a kit and if you can assemble
furniture and you're somewhat handy you
have two or three guys you can assemble
them above ground pool so I said yes
we'll do the deck we'll assemble the
pool was the deck built around the pool
correct yeah it was a you a deck
specifically for a pool and the person
said hey you know they just said hey do
you have any interest in you know
installing this pool for me I'll give
you I it's like 500 bucks and I looked

[12:00]
you I it's like 500 bucks and I looked
at the box and I youtubed it I like I
could knock this out in half a day with
a buddy so we'll do it videoed that got
two or three more pool jobs and that's
what kind of launched me like you you
set up a a camera and like a time-lapse
video or um I don't know if I did time
lapse I just I just film different
angles and okay and I have that sort of
you know Millennial marketing eye where
I can make a nice kind of Tik Tok Style
video so and that got you more jobs it
did 100% that got me more jobs I ran
where did you post it like sorry did you
post you push paid ads to the video or
you posted it to your personal socials
or I I posted my personal ones and I'd
ask friends to share it and then I post
it to my business social and then I ran
it as an ad as well so I used it an ad
which worked and then I on like Angie's
List I put that I was an above ground
pool installer that's like one of the
service options and got a couple of jobs
that way it's not glamour but they're
not that hard to do and there's a market
out there for people who want above
ground pools or cheaper pools it's 105

[13:01]
ground pools or cheaper pools it's 105
degrees in DFW for five months out of
the year if you don't have $100,000 for
an inground pool here's a $5,000 option
and most people don't believe the
inground pools cost 100 Grand but they
absolutely do yes it is that's where I
come in yeah okay all right so you
started doing pools you did a handful of
them and then what made you pivot away
from that so you know I learned about
what a stock tank pool is I saw it
online somewhere and I actually I wanted
a pool in my backyard after doing this
my wife's like you're building all these
pools now let's get in the abovegr pool
so I did the research on what I wanted I
didn't want anything high maintenance
and came across the idea of a stock tank
pool which I guess for for listeners out
there you know it's essentially you look
like a cattle trough it's those silver
round you know things you see on ranches
that horses drink out of people are were
converting those into pools and I
thought that was just such a cool idea
it's trendy looking um you know it's
real aesthetic and there's a company
down in Austin Cowboy Pools pools yeah

[14:00]
down in Austin Cowboy Pools pools yeah
and they are amazing at their marketing
and how they position it they actually
they do a lot more than we do to their
actual pool that with different
equipment there's more expensive but
there's as much more of a luxury set up
than the things that they do and I just
loved how it looked in the idea so I put
one in my backyard uploaded a video same
thing videoed it I was like I could
probably sell some of these and that
just took off did you ever see the
Instagram really I posted about this by
chance I did I did okay yeah I saw I
thought it was so cool yeah I saw that
and then I saw your whatever post about
interviewing for your podcast so yeah
yeah you're like Chris likes this yeah
it's funny because all the comments on
that are like you're so stupid no one
would pay $5,000 for this it's like I'm
not inventing this idea this is a thing
already I saw that I read all those
comments and I was like I can't believe
how much backlash this is getting I know
I'd get it on my ads too funny enough
people are just there's no way that
that's going to be so hot this and that
and they're just I'm like why are you
taking your time out of your day to
comment yeah on it I know business ad

[15:00]
comment yeah on it I know business ad
but it's part of the it helps the ad do
better yeah yeah keep engaging yeah so
are you buying these from like Tractor
Supply and then the pool equipment from
like Amazon yes so pool equipment from
Amazon and then the tanks themselves a
number of suppliers so Tractor Supply
has them there's like store Russell feed
in Supply which is might be local to
Texas there's a few of them and then a
couple other Farm and Ranch stores but
primarily Tractor Supplies where I where
I get them okay and what are the unit
economics on this business the tanks
they come in they come in a bunch of
sizes but the the ones for pools they're
either 8 foot diameter or 10ft diameter
and the 10 foot one from tractor supply
cost like 850 bucks 900 bucks sorry the
10 foot cost 850 to 900 and then the 8
foot cost around like 600 550 that's
just the tank itself from Tractor Supply
they change between location location
and then the pool equipment everything
the fittings there's a few Plumbing
pieces I buy a few extras a few things I
make it so the just easier maintenance

[16:00]
make it so the just easier maintenance
on the pool is like $3 to $400 three
it's called 350 so you know if you're
looking for a 10- foot pool with all the
pump with everything set up it's around
$1,200 I'd say for you the cost all that
the cost not including labor nope if I
was going to put one in my backyard
today went to buy everything $1,200 buy
everything you need now how many hours
of Labor are we talking an hour or less
wow drill some holes screw in some PVC
set it and forget it yep we offer ground
leveling so that the tank needs to be
level there's a lot of companies the
most of the companies I see out there
don't do that why would you not do that
it is tough you know sometimes you show
up and there's a like because it's hard
CRA huge incline especially in BFW if
you know the area like if I'm in
Glenrose it's Solid Rock I know the area
so I I ask the homeowner like hey you
live here how's the digging how much of
an incline are you on I I know that
beforehand and if I asked for a picture
and if it's a high incline I say we're

[17:00]
and if it's a high incline I say we're
going to upcharge you for digging more
than 4 in essentially I just use a
tiller and shovels and you know some
some days we've done some that took four
hours to level and it was just back how
much of an upcharge on average usually
it was like $300 and I say if if it's 4
Ines or more of an incline then we upch
charge you for the digging and then
there are a few that were just crazy
inclines and I would charge you know
five six hundred bucks for that yeah
okay but it it it wasn't hard and so we
we level the ground you know we deliver
the tank obviously we position it we
drill the holes you know install the
equipment we fill it with water and wait
for it to get to the right level and run
everything to make sure there's no leaks
everything's running properly walk the
homeowner through
everything and then you're done so
there's no continuous water source setup
you literally are just filling it up
with a hose right yeah you fill it with
a hose and then you run the pump and the
pump that we use is made for a pool you
know an above ground pool that's the
size of a tank so they stay really clean

[18:00]
size of a tank so they stay really clean
they're low maintenance super easy to
work on you know if you don't any
chemicals chlorine it's chlorine so you
buy little you know the rubber ducky
floaters and you put a little chlorine
tab in there and that's it less is more
you don't want to do anything crazy with
the chemicals because it's a steel tank
it's galvanized steel so if you put some
you know heavy harsh pool chemicals in
there it could cause rust it could cause
other issues to the tank yeah is it just
like for sitting like just just to like
chill have a drink get out of the hot
sun like you're not swimming in that
thing right definitely not you don't
want to dive into it but I'm you know
I'm 6'2 unless you're at a unless you're
at a circus and you're 50 feet up yeah
no I I'm 6'2 and I can E I have an eight
foot and I can put my arms up you know
crack a beer kick my legs all the way
out spread out and fully relax with my
wife and I have a kid one kid that's old
enough to get in so yes I'd say it's
it's like a lounge pool and then great
for kids as well and how deep it's 2
feet deep which is I found the perfect I
mean again I'm a little taller but my

[19:00]
mean again I'm a little taller but my
wife is I don't know 5 eight and we both
can sit there with our arms up and it's
not you know you're not too far down
you're not too far up it's a really it's
a nice depth to to sit in it's like a
cool hot tub it's like a cool tub it's
it's a hot tub that you can get them you
can get them with heaters but it's like
a hot tub that you sit in the lounge and
I mean it's again it's DFW it's so hot
in the summertime yeah I find I want to
mow the yard after I'm done mowing like
it's just so nice to go just dip in for
30 seconds like get all the grass off me
wash off cool down instantly there's
nothing like it I mean it's it's perfect
I think this is just the more I think
about it the more I think this is just a
brilliant product idea yeah like I feel
like if if you got those haters on the
phone and we actually had this
conversation like okay I could see why
you know like do you live in Texas do
you know what 106 plus 80% humidity
feels like for four months straight like
geez last week it was still 93 degrees
in mid October like what are we doing
yeah no it's it's hot summers if you

[20:02]
yeah no it's it's hot summers if you
don't have $100,000 for an inground pool
or if you don't want a giant abovegr
pool which has a lot of Maintenance this
is super easy and if you want to get rid
of it drain it flip it over put it on
Facebook Marketplace roll it to the dump
I mean it's can't do that with any other
pool no no man it's like it's perfect
for Millennials because Millennials want
it for themselves because they want to
you know crack a beer in the hot sun and
then their kids want it it's perfect for
the whole family is that your your
target market or are there like Boomers
in there too there's Boomers in there
too you know we worked with a lot of
older couples who used it as a you know
Lounge they're retired they just want a
place to cool off but they don't want to
invest in some Giant pool and then I had
plenty of families that had kids who
were you know five or six years old who
were sitting out there watching me fill
it with water saying can I get in now
can I get in now can I get in now
because it's it's not a kitty pool but I
mean it's it's a perfect size for for
kids to get in Splash play it's a my
daughter she's she's not even three and

[21:00]
daughter she's she's not even three and
she gets in and splashes and she loves
it she it's yeah it's awesome for kids
so all right so outside of the upch
charge for leveling it what do you
charge for these things your cost are
1,200 an hour of Labor whether it's you
or an employee what are you charging 8
foot I charge around $2,200 and then the
10 foot I can I charge 2400 to 26 I
Chang it I upart I went to 2600 last
season and was fine are they both two
feet deep they are okay and then what
are your primary customer acquisition
channels social media yeah so social
media paid Facebook ads I think I spent
around I spent like 3,500 bucks last
summer on Facebook ads that was the
primary driver was Facebook that I found
worked best for this business do you
know how many jobs that directly brought
you that $3,500 I don't I'm not off the
top of my head majority of them you know
80% I'd say came from that and
you know what was cool to see last

[22:00]
you know what was cool to see last
summer is I started to get a few
referrals people would post post me on
their social media tag me and then a few
days later i' say hey my friend you know
shared your story I'm in so and so
outside of Dallas wanted to get a quote
from you which was cool to see that
snowball effects start to happen the
Facebook ad acquisition Channel scalable
like could you really ramp that up yes
yeah I want to spend more this year for
sure but it definitely is I just have to
have you know it's just me and it was me
and my helper this last season yeah but
there were days where I could very
easily had two Crews you know I was not
turning down jobs but I was saying hey I
can get to you in eight to nine days and
some customers fell through the cracks
because of that I definitely can scale
it you just have to have I just need the
right things in place before I start
spinning more but I i' I'd pull back the
ad spin some days because I was booked
out you know 14 days and I didn't want
to lose business absolutely scalable now
is there a world where you could change
your ads up a little bit and add the

[23:00]
your ads up a little bit and add the
heating element add a few hundred more
dollars and make it like an allseason
hot tub cool tub yes and I thought about
that going into this off seon I I did a
few actually on the tail end whenever it
started cooling down which it cooled
down like yesterday it's been pretty hot
the last few days but there is you
absolutely can and there's a few other
things you need to do to make it a true
I wouldn't even say hot tub but Texas
summer is somewhat mild this wouldn't be
for every Market if you're up in the
north and you want a hot tub get a hot
tub you don't want to get this and then
because it's just not insulated well
enough it's going to cost you a lot of
electrical or propane there's basically
there's a steel tank and there's a poly
tank it's plastic you essentially have
to buy both put the plastic in the steel
so it's better insulated you can even
spray foam on the insides of the two to
make it a true hot tub but if you want
to go all season and you and you pay for
the ads and you you know Market as that
you absolutely can especially in this
market because we have mild winners and
you can get the water warmer rather than
yeah 10 degrees you know for a month all

[24:02]
yeah 10 degrees you know for a month all

music festivals they bring out a tub
they set it up Austin City Limits yes
yes sir yeah okay I don't think they're
part of that I'm just saying I've seen
them they were at some music festival I
just to Austin City Limits but it's
Austin there's you know one a festival a

[25:01]
Austin there's you know one a festival a
week but they just do really cool stuff
like that I mean they they they have
some really cool marketing so I know
they're doing well they also ship
Nationwide Pools which blows my mind how
they can do that but wow I wonder if you
could fit that on a pallet I mean
pallets are 4x4 they have a box truck
I've seen it that they jeez Louise I
don't know the logistics behind it how
does that work they have a video and
it's a box truck and these people are
you know unload loading it I don't know
where they're at they're outside of
Texas so I don't know if they're just
driving it from their warehouse in
Austin or what but it's it's cool it's a
interesting idea that that's possible
okay so this is something that you're
actively doing it's kind of going into
the off season but you're going to scale
it up even more next year right correct
so the the big I'd say the big
differentiator I want to do is buy the
tanks from the manufacturer the minimum
order it's around it's like $35,000 for
the purchase and you get I don't know
the number I've top my head it's like 70
to 80 tanks so you get you get a big

[26:01]
to 80 tanks so you get you get a big
Supply but that's the biggest headache
of this job for me last season was
getting the tanks finding them because I
was buying so many of them from Tractor
Supply from other feed stores I I'd buy
out their inventory in a few days and
then they wouldn't have any so now I'm
driving up to West Fort Worth and I have
a job in East Dallas so I have to go get
the tank drive across the Metroplex just
a hassle to get the tanks so that's my
next goal for next season is to get the
tanks you have to buy them all up front
and then you have to have a place to
store them all they're huge they take up
of space but once I have that I mean
that's just it's so much easier to to do
this yeah because I imagine you're like
you get a job then you go to Tractor
Supply and buy the tank so it's kind of
hard to scale under that system yes and
you know if if Tractor Supply had tanks
I'd buy them all when I started a month
into the business and saw that hey this
is working I had no problem buying all
the tanks I could could when I'd find
them storing him in my yard but they

[27:01]
them storing him in my yard but they
don't carry more than you know five or
six so it's tough to know and there's
two sizes you know and so some places it
happened all the time tractor suppli
said they had a 10 foot I drive an hour
and a half to go on site and it's an
eight foot or it has a huge dent in it
because it's been sitting in the yard
and someone hit it with a forklift so
yeah that getting the tanks was a pain
but buying them from the manufacturer
it's a hefty build but it's a
GameChanger to have it in your Warehouse
go pick up what you need and go yeah I
mean you could have a big storage unit
even right yeah that's that's what I'm
going to do is just have a storage unit
and fill them super easy and and
whenever I did the math I mean it saves
me several hundred a job like three or 4
hundred bucks and that's just the cost
of the tank not the time not the
headache to go get it from tractor my
margins go up first of all I love
talking to you because you're doing all
these little things like you're very
ADHD like myself which that's a
compliment like I know to some it's not
but yeah no it is it is like it could be

[28:00]
but yeah no it is it is like it could be
bad but I'm biased about myself so I
think it's good so I think you're
good all right so tell me about the
sauna business because this you've got a
brick and mortar business there in curn
which is south of DFW I'm very curious
about that as well so it started out
there's five of us total five partners
and I wasn't even on the trip it was a
bachelor trip with some of of that group
of guys and they all party too hard the
night four and they found a place I
think they were in Louisiana they found
a contrast therapy place which is a
sauna sauna and cold plunge contrast
therapy facility so basically you know
you get in the cold water you get in
sauna you can go back and forth and it's
supposed to alleviate hangovers they did
that and loved it and basically you know
had the conversation of we should start
one of these and you know back home in
DFW and this was two three years ago
that they originally talked about it and
they very seriously put the work in they
talk to you know building owners to find
a spot to lease they you know put a
proposal together did 90% of the work
but they struggled to find the right

[29:01]
but they struggled to find the right
location I'm in CL Texas the gym I work
out at World Gym had a office or a build
a you know it's probably two times you
can't see my room two times as big as as
a bedroom and it was fleas inside of the
gym and I snapped a picture to my and
said hey you know what about in here
like we're inside of a gym absolutely
they loved it you know I was you know
doing the pools at the time so that's so
lucky sorry I got to interrupt you not
like you didn't do any hard work but
like it's just like the perfect location
in your backyard in your gym probably
stupid cheap and it's like the perfect
audience you're not going to compete
with the gym they I'm sure they have
this isn't even on their radar so they
don't care is it is just was it just
perfect or is that just me it was and
that's why that's why it worked out and
that's why you know I got to be cut in
as you know partner and all the stars
aligned but on top of that everything
you just said you know I was the guy who
was going to run it manage iter
trustworthy you know we didn't have to
hire out and we could save money by

[30:01]
hire out and we could save money by
using me who I work too much and don't
get paid enough for it so it all worked
out it's like the only gym there's a
Planet Fitness in town this Gym's you
know 10 times better it's nice it's
clean there's awesome equipment it's
always packed and you know that's our
perfect audience I we do run ads but we
don't have to because the gym brings in
people naturally if anyone moves down
here they want to join a gym they go to
World Gym and we're right inside the gym
which is awesome before we get too
deeply into it I want to know what they
saw in Louisiana that like was the light
bulb moment for them I don't know the
name of the facility but they they went
and did it themselves and how great they
felt afterwards so you know and what is
it exactly I I'm not familiar with the
concept yeah so it's a a cold plunge is
basically it's a big bathtub okay sorry
it's it's a cold plunge yeah and it has
a filter on it it's running it's
chlorinated it's running 247 it's like a
$10,000 piece of equipment one of them
but the water gets like it gets down to
30 I think these get to 35 36 okay which

[31:02]
30 I think these get to 35 36 okay which
is it's colder than the ice bath that's
that's cold yeah if it's literally
colder than ice yeah so I mean you think
you know ice water Frozen is 32 degrees
if you get in water that's 32 degrees
what happens when you sit still your
body forms like a heat barrier around
your body and it actually keeps you a
little warm the way these cold chares
work they circulate water so it's
constantly running so your body doesn't
no no warm for you not at all you don't
ever warm up so so it's it's tougher
than an ice bath I get a lot of athletes
that say you know I did Ice baths and
football in high school this is not like
that it's but it's that and then in
combination with the sauna so it's a
it's a in sauna that you sit in we have
four of them they get really hot and
that that it's called contrast therapy
going hot cold okay does a lot the body
you're riding like every Tailwind every
Title Wave right now Andrew huberman is
like your best friend Joan every every
Tech bro every podcast every tweet is
all on your on your side they're all

[32:00]
all on your on your side they're all
your business partners yeah whenever I I
hire a new employee and I kind of work
with them on their sales pitch you can
get really scientific with what it does
for the body you can also say you know
pro athletes take ice ice fast for a
reason right like yeah it's it's proven
it's already out there yeah if you can't
remember these scientific words you know
on day one talk about how your favorite
athlete takes ice baths yeah Dak
Prescott uses it you're good to go where
do we sign exactly so and yeah the
demand's out there it's a really cool
upand cominging thing this contrast
therapy are the infrared saunas are are
those like the more affordable ones yes
and no they're probably more expensive
than a traditional SAA because a
traditional SAA you just need a little
electric heater and you can put it in a
I wouldn't do this but you can put it in
a closet and heat the room up yeah but
you need like you need it insulated you
need you know floors to be able to
handle moisture these are we buy I mean
it's a kit and you basically assemble
the sauna and there's two infrared
heaters and it has like red light
therapy and it's it's a it's a nice it's
a nice unit and they cost us like 7 to

[33:01]
a nice unit and they cost us like 7 to
8,000 each okay okay yeah not that's not
very cheap I mean cheaper than like a
purpose-built you know Cedar sauna but
not cheap no some people convert their
closets and you can go buy cedar planks
from a hardware store you know insulate
the room then you just buy the electric
heater which can cost okay 500 bucks um
so you can you can get away with a cheap
sauna okay it's the same thing you just
have to know how to do it I imagine you
got one cold pledge and four CU they're
spending four times as much time in the
in the sauna yeah we have two cold
plunges four saunas okay okay so twice
as long yep yeah so the way our room
it's set up is our facility is set up we
have a cold plunge that's in a private
room so if you know people are you know
put girls getting in a swimsuit or guys
taking a shirt off you know they want
some privacy they're gonna scream at the
shock make faces you know they can have
their own time we have a sauna same
thing it's in a private room and then we
have a cold plunge that's like as soon
as you walk in it's right there under
our neon sign you know for that visual

[34:00]
our neon sign you know for that visual
effect oh man you're just taking your
Tik Tok brain and and imp planting it
there huh exactly like this has to be
sharable exactly is there a different
price for the private versus public and
I think it's so brilliant that you did
both because like me I'm an introvert I
don't like people watching me believe it
or not I'm on a podcast I don't don't
like that yeah so if I go on a cold
plunge unless I'm with like my best
friend I don't want I don't want any
eyes on that I'll go in the private one
but a lot of people or just like the
shock aspect of it and the the viral
aspect of it like or it's there's like
the Dare aspect the challenge like you
really need to have a public and a
private yeah you do we have just
membership levels and if you buy the top
membership then you get access you can
download our app and you can book ahead
of a time which got an app it's so it's
not we didn't develop the app it's our
right it's a software we use it's like
white labeled or yeah we just like put
our logo on it and when someone logs in
they see our in still I mean to the
general public that's your own app
cool for sure so they can book ahead of

[35:00]
cool for sure so they can book ahead of
time with the app and then we have a you
know the lowest membership level you
can't book ahead of time you can still
use the private stuff but if it's booked
ahead of time like you're out of luck
you just got to wait or whatever so
that's how we structure it is basically
pay for the highest membership and then
you can book and have it whenever you
want what are the membership prices and
levels unlimited if you want unlimited
access it's a 45 minute session $75 a
month and that gives you access to the
sauna and the plunge and if you look at
our competition
we we're half I mean there's there's one
up in Fort Worth if you're in Dallas
you're looking at like $1 150 to $175 a
month they use the same equipment we do
yeah might have a nicer built out you
know Standalone facility in Downtown
Dallas but they have the same exact saas
we use and the same plunges we use wow
okay so unlimited 75 bucks a month is
that private or public both that's where
you can book the private and then you
can we also just have walk-ins so if you
want to walk in use a sign use the

[36:00]
want to walk in use a sign use the
plunge Walkin how much is I thought the
private was more expensive it's not more
expensive it's only available for the
people who pay
75 if if you don't pay that 75 then you
don't have access to book those the
private ones gotcha and then how much is
just a Walkin like a one time a one time
is $30 if you're just walking in 30
bucks and you get you know a full
session okay and are most people doing
it just after their gym session or are
they coming in just for that majority
are after their gym session a few people
come in use the C plunge go work out
lift and then they come back for the
sauna because C plunge wakes you up
gives you a ton of energy dopamine then
they go work out after that you know
they must love it I bet you get amazing
feedback it's crazy it it is I mean we
have people so we offer a first time's
free and we did that because people
would come inart they get hooked I I've
never done it before the first time I
did it I was hooked yeah so we do that
and then people just just come back
naturally and say hey I need to do this
again let me sign up oh man okay so is

[37:00]
again let me sign up oh man okay so is
there like a funnel like a physical like
a physical funnel where they walk in the
gym and there's like some signage like
how much leeway do you have to like
funnel people towards your door yeah I
mean the gyms they work with us you know
we we bring in customers for us that
naturally join the gym and vice versa so
yeah we have signs out front we have you
know posters on our windows and our and
we're right by the water coolers so I
have some signs right above the water
coolers you know the gym helps us out
they also
like share our social media they help us
with like their our email list you know
they gave us their email list they us
which was huge they're they're very
helpful I mean such a beneficial
relationship with a Jin and there's no
like what do you pay them in like in
rent 2,000 a month okay yeah but outside
of that there's no like Financial it's
just kind of like you scratch my back
I'm scratching yours we can't really
measure exactly but we just both trust
this is very symbiotic yes yeah we we
explored you know being included in
their gym membership and working with
them like that but it gets a little

[38:00]
them like that but it gets a little
hairy it does it gets a little hairy and
we you know we we open December 1st this
year so we're new we were just figuring
it out so we're we're completely
separate in that you know in that regard
but we share the same building and we
both you know beneficially bringing
business to each other you said December
1 so like the end of last year last year
end of last year okay yep and how has it
gone so far like what are your numbers
like how many customers yeah so we're
we're close to break even we just paid
off all our equipment so which is huge
cuz we we did a one-year note
essentially a little less than that
we're right at like 130 monthly
recurring members with insurance you
know what we pay our employees and rent
and you know we do Facebook ads and all
our other little Rinky Dink things we're
close to break even after within the
first year which is great yeah including
paying off your equipment outside of
that okay okay yeah so saunas are like
what 30 grand for all those cold plunge
20 grand yeah 50 Grand essentially for

[39:01]
20 grand yeah 50 Grand essentially for
all the equipment I know insurance was
we're trying to work on getting
Insurance lower because you know it's a
big liability to have water on the floor
someone get out of the plunge slip out
of the plunge so we have a pretty high
insurance bill but we're working on
getting that lower but also it hasn't
been a year and we haven't done a lot of
marketing outside of the gym itself and
Facebook so that's part of what I'm
doing now is getting more involved with
the clav community and surrounding
cities to to do a little more like
guerilla marketing type stuff I mean I
think January is GNA be massive because
I'm sure you you wanted to capture that
New Year's Tailwind but nobody knew
about you yet right but now it's like
you've got thousands of people that know
about you that have never signed up that
January 1 rolls around it's like okay
let's do it I'm excited for January and
it works out you know being in the pool
off season is I'll have more time for
but and also naturally you know DFW
summer it's 105 degrees out who wants to
go sit in sauna some do I do after my
workout I mean I still go you know cold

[40:01]
workout I mean I still go you know cold
plunge feels nice but there's a dip June
July with just member activity both new
and current members but we're really
picking up now especially with this cold
front that just came in what's Like Your
Capacity with your your four saunas and
your two coal plunges what could your Mr
be at full capacity our goal has always
been 200 members that's not the capacity
by any means you can fit three people
comfortably in each sauna oh you have
the private one so three that's 12 on
the or that's sorry that's nine on
people on the outside in the sauna and
then one in the private so that's 10
people in the sauna at once and then two
people in the cold plunge you know 12
people in there that it'd be crowded
it'd be a little hectic we haven't
gotten there but we've had you know six
eight people in there at once
comfortable W but 200 has always been
our goal but that's not capacity we
could yeah I mean cuz you could serve
like if you divide it up like a customer
every five or six minutes really yeah if
it's 45 minutes and I'm sure it's like
morning and afternoons and like dead in

[41:00]
morning and afternoons and like dead in
between right yeah there definitely are
some LS where you know one or two people
come in during the work day but your
your spot on mornings are very busy and
then you know once people get off work
they go work out if they're coming into
us after they work out at six o'clock
range gets real busy for us how often do
you cycle out the water in the cold
plunge is that a concern that's probably
the the my least favorite part of this
job because I do it myself every two
days so I go in there and we didn't buy
a drain so we'd have to like Jackhammer
through the floor through the concrete
so I have to pump the water out through
a like through a pipe so I go in there
with the pump and hose I did it this
morning I was up at 5 a.m went to drain
you regret not getting a drain I do
that's gonna be my first purchase once
we you know start making some money off
this thing is a definitely have a drain
but it's not that bad but you do have to
stay on top of that the saa's super low
maintenance you know we wipe them down
every like I did it at the six Monon
Mark I sanded it and I put this clear
coat to protect it from wet stains and

[42:01]
coat to protect it from wet stains and
stuff but the water the cold plunges are
the the most maintenance for for the
physical space how has everything gone
according to your projections because
like you and I have been in this seat
sometimes alone sometimes with Partners
you put a spreadsheet together and
you're like everyone's on Cloud9 you're
like this is amazing we just need to get
this many customers we'll break even
yeah how is it gone compared to how that
conversation went it's good I'm not the
numbers guy in this equation so you know
if I was ever worried I'd get but you're
wearing a Patagonia vest like what are
you doing I know yeah it's for my old
corporate job I didn't buy it it was
given okay but he's all smiles when we
get on the calls and he talks the
numbers and goes through the giant
Finance list and he like this is all
good I mean steady upwards it's a slow
burn and I always have to remind myself
it hasn't even been a year yet like yeah
we're in the gym I I work out there
almost you know probably five six times
a week and I see people who I know have
not came in yet and I have people the
shoulder and I say hey have you tried us
out yet no why not I just you know

[43:01]
out yet no why not I just you know
haven't gone in there I you know people
are just hesitant or afraid to come try
us out so there's still a ton of
opportunity just being in that gym which
is awesome yeah but it's just a slow
burn but it's a steady upward Arrow
which is nice we're I wonder if you
could do like if you could like work
with the gym to do like a cold plunge
day maybe you could do like a free day
and and you're already doing free but
like like a day dedicated to everyone
doing a cold plunge or you could even
test it where it's like hey $20 Amazon
or Starbucks gift card for for doing a
free cold plunge like literally paying
them if if they're really getting
addicted right off the bat like why not
we've done some interesting marketing
things nothing like a c plune day the
one I've been thinking about for
Christmas is we'll match your not match
your donation we'll donate on your
behalf for you know if you're in the C
plunge for X minutes that's X dollars oh
that's cool so we're going to donate to
to I have to find
where Have You Ever Seen Those prank

[44:00]
where Have You Ever Seen Those prank
videos where someone walks up to someone
on the street and they're like hey for a
dollar would you save a child have you
ever seen that and they're like what huh
like for a dollar we say okay here's
five doll and then the van rolls up five
kids Sprint out and they're like what
you can do that for every minute that
you don't stay in the cold plunge
someone in Africa is starving
yeah some people yeah what's the plan to
scale this or is your scaling plan just
like let's double our customers in this
one location or do you really want
multiple locations we want multiple
locations we want to do a couple more
you know under our you know partnership
and then we want to franchise so again
that's where I probably wouldn't have
started this business if I didn't have
the partners that I do the finance guy
that I do that's how his mind works he
knows to side he knows how to franchise
he knows you know how to go out and get
a loan you know raise money but we want
to get this one profitable and then we
want to pull the trigger on one or two
ourselves and then after that we want to
just open the door hey let's get 10 more

[45:00]
just open the door hey let's get 10 more
this year yeah I look at it as very
similar to the Float Spa concept but
probably less trendy which is a good
thing like more sustainable right you
just have high fixed cost you got one
employee at the door checking people in
and out not high fixed cost High upfront
onetime costs then you got your set
overhead that literally does not change
every month and you once we hit this in
mrr we're good after that it's all gravy
kind of how you look at it I do yes and
that's what all excited it's it's an
interesting business model I just
monthly recurring revenue is just it's
an amazing beautiful yeah I just I I
love it and every time I sign someone up
or get a new member you know I don't see
it it's you know yeah we just got 75
bucks how long are they gonna stay I
mean every month now we're getting that
it's just it's it's aous feeling yeah I
like to call this like a a piggyback
model like you see a new Walmart opens
and a Game Stops right in front of it
you see a Starbucks open and there's a
Chipotle right next to it and then more
specifically an LA Fitness opens there's

[46:02]
specifically an LA Fitness opens there's
going to be a strip mall out front with
like a GNC and like a Jamba Juice and
it's like you the hardest part about
this in my opinion is going to be
finding that space that's small enough
for your need I used to open iPhone
repair stores and we wanted to be in the
best retail locations like the best
because it was an upscale store but we
only needed four 500 sare F feet but no
nobody builds under a 12200 really
square feet in a strip mall that was
always the hardest part is finding the
small enough space for this yeah yeah I
mean it's the location location location
very important and the fact that we're
in the gym you know we wouldn't we
wouldn't be in cland Texas that wouldn't
be our location if for that spot and
I've driven around to other gyms I I I
pulled a big list of gyms in DFW and I
drove to like 10 of them to see if they
had any office space like one did but
they weren't interested they were using
it for something else but it's a go if
you find a spot like that so this gym

[47:01]
you find a spot like that so this gym
there's a barber shop next to us that is
slammed and I go I go there when I've
joined the gym I said that's amazing
they have a barber shop here completely
separate entity like the gym just like
us but it's packed out the door I talk
to them every day they stay super busy I
know the owner I mean they crush it
there so it is what you said that
piggyback aspect find the right spot a
gym with an office in it yeah it's a
Gold Line If other than the that you
know adding the drain with a jackhammer
what would you have done differently on
on day one or day negative 10 I'd say
Focus so our employees you know we
wanted the place to be clean and
presentable that was what we drove home
during the interviews and hiring process
I would shift that mindset to you're not
just a front desk associate you're a
salesperson your your job is to sell
memberships and on this you know the
back burner I don't say back burner but
this the second half is you know keeping
the space clean you know making sure
it's presentable but you're a
salesperson that's your job title
membership sales associate is what we

[48:01]
membership sales associate is what we
call them focus more on that so I've got
a customer acquisition idea for you I
don't want to tell you what this was
being used for because a friend told me
this in confidence so I don't want to
tell you the industry but I'll just tell
you that it's working very I would tell
you off the podcast but I'll tell you
it's working very well in a different
industry dming people locals on
Instagram specifically finding people
that are checking in in local areas you
know they live there you know they're
millennial you can see their pictures
and offering them a discount to join it
seems like very unscalable but it it's
very scalable and it's a very similar
demographic to what you're doing in a
similar service kind of similar price
point in everything yeah that's
interesting this is an awesome business
I feel like 5 10 years from now we're
going to see these all over there's a
few big players out there and some nice
nice areas around DFW and around the
nation but it's it's grow fast well we
don't want to say their names cuz you're
going to be the one doing this

[49:00]
going to be the one doing this
franchising it yeah drip social SAA curn
Texas what's your website
drip.co I primarily I run the Instagram
and we have this guy at the gym he has
like 200,000 followers he's a fitness

slow season I mean we're not not doing
any but when it warms back up I'm
planning on you know my goals 100 plus
next next season so man that's a good
business yeah I'll hit you six figures
in profit yeah it was a crazy crazy
summer for us was that your first full
summer or first summer period First full
summer I I did the the one before you
know I did I was focusing more in The
Woodworking and I did a couple of them
and then I said you know what how quick
this was I'm going to hammer I'm going
to change all my ads started working and
then I just shifted my whole business to

[51:00]
then I just shifted my whole business to
we're Texas tank pools now and that's
what we do yeah see this is just like my
call right before this was a guy that's
doing trash can cleaning and he's being
very diligent and he's focused and he
quit his job for this and it's growing
and it's it's go it's going well but
he's saying no to a thousand things and
that's one way it's not right it's not
wrong that's just one way that works you
and I are different we're chasing
rabbits right we're pivoting every 6
hours 6 months whatever it tends to be
but it's like it doesn't matter like
we're constantly refining down all right
okay I don't like that I like this I
like that oh this is a cool acquisition
Channel let's try this one over here
let's try this like people get so hung
up on Focus or not focus and it's just
like just stay in the game just I love
that stay in the game advice you know my
wife tells me the exact opposite quit
starting businesses quit doing that yeah
and you always hear that but I I'm GNA
switch to your thinking I like that yeah
well I'm gonna I'm gonna one day I'm
going to sell a T-shirt and it's just
going to say compounding doesn't care

[52:00]
going to say compounding doesn't care
like we're not in we're not interrupting
compounding when we switch business
ideas because we're still in the game
like we're still in business like if you
quit business then yes compounding is
interrupted it's like selling a stock
but it's like our experiences our
failures they all compound and our wins
get more exponential as we go I love
that I'm the most biased person that
will ever give you that advice but play
this for your wife I'm listening to it
yeah I'll see what she says there you go

appreciate it and this is going to be
awesome likewise thank you Chris I
