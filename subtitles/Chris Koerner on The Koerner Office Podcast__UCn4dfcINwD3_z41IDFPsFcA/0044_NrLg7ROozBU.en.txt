every single day people call my show and
ask me the one same question I have X
business idea but is this Market
oversaturated and my answer is always
the same no it's not oversaturated
nothing is oversaturated and here's why
you first need to know the supply and
the demand of that idea in that market
and you probably haven't done that
research yet here's how you do the
research let's say you want to start a
pressure washing business in Roswell New
Mexico I'm going to go scrape all the
pressure washing businesses in cities of
the same size of Roswell so I know how
many can a market support and then I'll
go do the same research in Roswell and
see is it over or under saturated here
let's say it's oversaturated oh I don't
want to launch no because then you need
to do more research how well are my
competitors marketing do they have
Google my business profiles are they
doing SEO are they doing pay-per-click
and I bet you they're not which means
even if it looks oversaturated on the
surface it's not follow me for more
business ideas like these
