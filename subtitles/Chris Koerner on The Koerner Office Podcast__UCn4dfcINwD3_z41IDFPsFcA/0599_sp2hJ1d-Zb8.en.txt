[00:00]
so I was recently introduced to this guy
named Brian now Brian has kind of a
crazy story because he was living with
his family in Utah and he picked up
everything took his startup and moved it
to Puerto Rico why would he do that well
it turns out there's some pretty crazy
tax advantages to moving your startup to
Puerto Rico and he wanted to save some
money after selling that startup Brian
now works for a nonprofit called invest
PR is in invest Puerto Rico and so I
wanted to learn what kinds of cool
startups are there in Puerto Rico what
exactly are the financial benefits of
running your company from Puerto Rico is
Puerto Rico part of the US how do taxes
work yada yada yada super interesting
stuff hope you
[Music]
enjoy I'm Brian bourgery I live here in
Puerto Rico been here about seven years
um I work with invest Puerto Rico
currently which I'll get more into in a
minute but basically put I'm a tech
entrepreneur and ecosystem Builder by
Nature uh so most of my life I've
started different companies ever since I
was little whether it's on the side of
the street selling magic cards or

[01:01]
the street selling magic cards or
something or whatever it is but I really
started getting into a tech when I was
younger I think I got grounded for most
of a summer one time and started
building janky websites and stuff but on
that path I've kind of been following a
lot of new opportunities and I tend to
gravitate towards less common paths for
whatever that might be whether it's
schooling or business or something else
long story short after working through
some technology companies with companies
like qual tricks and crowd engine and
being deep in like the crowdfunding
space and other things like that I ended
up in Puerto Rico with the tech company
we were running that company we made
like plug- andplay home servers we're
really early in developing like we're
blockchain ties into into secure
Hardware things like that really focus
on security privacy ownership control of
your data that sort of thing did some
firsts in that regard especially on the
capital raising side where it comes to
like we the first one of the first reg
CF companies to have raise Capital
successfully first one to do that with a
concurrent Indiegogo product pre-order
and had a whole Strate around there for

[02:00]
and had a whole Strate around there for
converting customers to investors
investors and customers so that was
great so that's a company we were
running seven years ago when we ended up
stumbling upon Puerto Rico which is
where I've been since so we had moved
our company here for a number of reasons
the two biggest ones were the ecosystem
and Community were by far my favorite I
had ever been in especially for those
who maybe like a little bit of ambiguity
or 21 century Frontier if you will and
and also in part because there's
phenomenal tax incentives for business
owners especially entrepreneurs here on
the island as well for those who don't
know Puerto Rico yes part of the United
States you don't need a passport some
currency just jump on a plan fly here so
yeah that's one aspect and I've been
here ever since so that company was
actually acquired just a year into
living here in early 2019 and I jumped
into economic development after that
well I promised my wife I wouldn't
plunge all of our money and everything
into another company for number of years
so I thought what am I going to do that
won't drive me insane that's regular and
stable and that ended up being working
working with invest Puerto Rico which is

[03:01]
working with invest Puerto Rico which is
a public private partnership so it's
mandated by the government to be in
charge of new business and investment
attraction but it's not government we
work hand inand with the government to
bring new investors new Innovations new
companies to get set up new
entrepreneurs on the island and that's
something I've been passionate about I
run an ecosystem in a group with about
5,000 members and the entrepreneurial
space as well on the island so that just
kind of fit always kind of leaning in on
Tech and some of my stronger standpoints
but it also opened my eyes to
a whole different way of doing things
because I was in Utah before this and
I'm from Minnesota I've lived in other
parts of the world too so it's just very
interesting
seeing how the environment of wherever
you're living really can unlock I guess
unthought of opportunities um that that
you would have come across otherwise so
what first tipped you off about Puerto
Rico like were you reading something or
seeing it and what makes one go from oh
that's cool that's interesting or I
could save some money there to let's
move my whole family there on that note

[04:00]
move my whole family there on that note
I've been aware of Puerto Rico my entire
life I actually have uh some family who
lived on the small island of vus and I
had come here when I was a kid although
I never thought I'd live here never
thought about it from a business
standpoint so I was aware of things I
knew there some tax incentives hadn't
gone deep but it wasn't until late 2017
there was some news articles and we were
talking to different people in the
decentralized technology ecosystem and
there's already a lot of people
congregating down here so we're like I
think we should go down there and check
it out see what's happening but it it's
funny cuz I remember I was just talking
to my wife in the living room shortly
after having a little kid I think I
think she was maybe one at the time our
first and I just told her I'm not gonna
be gone all the time doing all these
crazy hours of different stuff and as
I'm telling her that my business partner
calls me and he's like hey we have to go
to Puerto Rico there's some
opportunities here and you got to be
there to make sure we make a good
decision I'm like when he's like tonight
I already bought your ticket I'm like oh
crap so back room oh as yeah same night

[05:00]
crap so back room oh as yeah same night
so like six hours later uh flying out of
Salt Lake and I'm like oh shoot um so I
walked back in and to I think it's
probably a miracle how all this happened
but I'm just like hey hun how would you
like if company fleed to California to
hang out with your family for a few days
and luckily she took me up on that so it
worked out we ended up bringing our
family after that trip because within a
few hours we had plugged into amazing
people service providers accelerators
things like that and just kind of like
fell love with things even though it was
right after a major hurricane and things
were still developing I'm like if
there's this much like energy and
opportunity and things happening now
it's only better when things are back on
its feet and I really opened my eyes to
not just the ecosystem and the unique
aspects of a US territory that make
doing business advantageous but really
into incentives and how you could
structure things appropriately to
minimize your taxes and maximize profits
without having to do anything too

[06:01]
without having to do anything too
outrageous now in our case we moved to
an island some might think that's
outrageous but we've loved it still here
had three more kids sense so hopefully
that says something but that really
opened my eyes to from the individual
side being able to pay zero taxes on
capital gains dividends interest was
huge I was also someone who had gotten
into cryptocurrencies early on so I'm
like oh well if those ever go up that
could be beneficial being a Founder I
was willing to bet on myself and our
team and say hey if we're successful
this will pay off then on the business
side there's all these different
incentives you can have at the time like
a zero to 4% corporate tax rate and for
those who aren't familiar like there are
no federal income taxes in Puerto Rico
for US citizens so you're really just
paying zero or four two four% depending
what you're doing and that's great now
it's a startup not making profit yet
that doesn't matter as much but what did
matter was for those who do like
research and development and things like

[07:00]
research and development and things like
that is you can get 50% of all of your
expenditures back in sellable tax
credits you're so we were very R&D heavy
creating new technologies so we spent
about a million dollars that first year
uh that would qualify for half a million
dollars in tax credits now as a startup
losing money you don't necessarily need
tax credits but there is open markets
that you can sell them on anywhere for
like 92 to 96 cents on the dollar very
healthy Market to do that there's even
funds that will lend on those credits
the government will buy them back for 90
cents on the dollar so like there's a
very healthy Market in that regard for
cycling those credits which obviously
can PL plunge right back into your
operations of your company which it's
phenomenal minimizes Equity or anything
else that you got to give out so what
was the specific circumstance where you
had to leave that night yeah just bought
the ticket already and there was there
was a couple events that he heard were
going to happen to meet some key people

[08:00]
going to happen to meet some key people
who are within the technology space that
we were in and just knowing my partner
too he likes he liked to act quick so
there's that as well I was like all
right well let's just do it so we did
and here we are never turning back y yep
yep was there any like culture shock to
you or your your family uh when you
moved there that you had to overcome
yeah yeah I mean there's definitely
differences to me I was like oh it's a
very good Mash of Latin America and the
us there is a really good mix it's a
bilingual Spanish first but a lot of
people speak English they teach English
K through 12 in all the schools and
stuff so people at least understand it
even if they're not speaking it much
there some things are going to be the
same I we have CostCo Walgreens but then
you also have a lot more Street cart
vendors and and think think more Latin
American and Caribbean mix so you have
that in there school system although
it's part of the US school system it's
still a little different some things
will function differently healthc care
is going to be outrageously cheaper like

[09:00]
is going to be outrageously cheaper like
outrageously cheaper but you also don't
have any bells and whistles like when
you have your kids they bring your own
um depending where you're at maybe bring
your own extra blanket or bigger towels
because they'll have like cheap little
chiny ones but on the flip side we had
twins here like four years ago and after
insurance I think we paid
$152 so there are definitely
expectations you need to set um if
you're not used to being far from home
find a community to plug into and
there's definitely phenomenal community
local Puerto Ricans are amazing people
and friendly and everything and of
itself So that obviously made thing
really things really nice and easy as
well and there's just a lot of smart
people too so you really get your eyes
open to a lot of things that that you
wouldn't have really thought of before
what kind of people have you met since
living there that also not necessarily
cool businesses or cool entrepreneurs
but people that specifically moved to
Puerto Rico for the startup ecosystem
and what kind of things are they doing
so we have a lot of people who move down
they're just service based businesses

[10:00]
they're just service based businesses
like like exporting of service so
something more digital or they're
Management Services so so that I'll
break that into two trunks so you have
those are maybe running a digital agency
well actually have a lot of different
podcasters and people who live here too
but people are producing something that
they don't have to physically be out
somewhere else that's a almost a
no-brainer very L barrier to entry
digital Nomads things like that that I
would also break into owners so that
could be one of my friends he owns a
bunch of gyms in the southern part of
the us a chain of those so he manages
everything exports his Management
Services to a Stateside company things
like that from the island and is able to
pay 4% tax rate and still fly back
whenever he wants it's not a hassle
because it's still in the same country
and everything and there's been others
like that who own maybe other franchises
or restaurants or construction companies
who the management might move here to
the island and manage things and just go
in as needed so that's very common a
very low barrier to entry we have a lot
of very tech for people so I mentioned

[11:00]
of very tech for people so I mentioned
research and development um obviously on
the tax and and capital side it's a
great spot doing R&D and that could be
software Hardware agriculture any type
of research and development discovering
something new set up very good for
especially with IP being part of the us
and things like that but then not having
to pay federal exit taxes when you sell
it or anything even internationally then
you have a lot of the people who are
investors who are moving down so maybe
they're fund manager
it's like panta capital is a very big
one and and some others their management
teams moved down here for both personal
and Company incentive reasons but then
they're also with a bunch of other fund
managers and investors who have moved
down which helps them find new LPS and
investors and things like that so it's
kind of grown really interestingly so
video is cool but you know what's better
long form audio via podcast and my
newsletter TKO pod.com go there to
subscribe for free to my newsletter it's
one email a week very tactical and then
go to my audio podcast three episodes a

[12:00]
go to my audio podcast three episodes a
week stuff like this you're going to
love it all free no sleazy sales
TKO pod.com in that regard and to this
point after I mean seven years for me
being here full-time and more than that
that Puerto Rico's kind of been
increasing I'd say almost exponentially
in like its ecosystem growth from like a
startup Innovation standpoint now
there's just like a spattering of
everything there's people who move here
and have no clue there's tax incentives
so they're here for other reasons or
they want to have a beach life or they
want their family to be close and have
Adventure but they still want to be
close to their family in the states so
they don't want to leave the country so
there's a lot of different pockets and
mixes which I kind of like and that's
what helped this start our group
uncommon entrepreneurs which is just
full of uncommon entrepreneurs as the
name says is people from all walks of
life from all parts of the world locally
born born in Asia born in the states
wherever coming together and just being
able to meet and see what's going on so
that's really opened my eyes to so many
different business opportunities
investment opportunities I never would

[13:00]
investment opportunities I never would
have thought before and it's super
accessible one you have a naturally
awesome population that's really smart
locally already and then you have some
of the smartest most well-resourced
well-connected people in the world
moving down and in this case is I it's
an island so you can only get so far
away so there's just a lot of natural
connections that happen so I I hear
about people connecting and creating
businesses or starting things all the
time many times safe side it doesn't
even have to just be on the island um
just from the the connections that
they're making so for me that's like one
of the most exciting if not the most
exciting part of living here yeah now I
don't know if it's you're able to answer
this question but let's say I have a
business in the states that does a
million dollars Topline two 200,000
bottom line and I can run it anywhere in
the world and I'm seriously considering
Puerto Rico like what does that look
like on a real dollar value uh for me if
I'm making $200,000 a year in profit
let's just assume I pull it all out as
my own personal net income what does

[14:00]
my own personal net income what does
that look like on a real dollar basis
yeah yeah so that'll depend on a couple
things so those would be if you're just
applying for a business incentive and to
run and essentially manage your business
from the island or if you're also
applying for the individual investor
incentive which is the zero tax on
capital gains dividends interest I'll
set that aside for a moment yeah so
let's just say you're setting up the
business not worrying about the
individual investor incentive at all um
that case you'll come down there's a
couple different ways you can structure
things but one common ways you'll set up
a Puerto Rican act 60 um tax
incentivized company that will be a
Management Services Company let's say to
service your already existing state side
company so anything that you do as the
owner and as much as you can can come
through that now that might just be your
Management Services but if you do
anything else back office do any
accounting or or or anything customer
support sales if you can do anything
from Puerto Rico that's great because

[15:00]
from Puerto Rico that's great because
that's going to give you a lower tax
rate overall but if it's just the owning
and and and providing the services if
you're making let's say 200,000 like you
said that's not going to be high enough
to trigger a lot of the employee
requirements so you don't have to like
hire other people when you're like over
three million and stuff then you might
have to have two or three or how many
employees but in this case you just have
yourself um you could pay yourself a
modest salary so maybe 30 or 50 or
whatever thousand I'll leave that for
your CPA to tell you specifically what
you should do but pay yourself a mod
modest salary that's going to be taxed
at regular rates here which depending
how much you're making can be comparable
to your state and federal combined since
we don't have Federal we have a higher
tax basis but the nice thing is that as
an owner of an x60 incentivized company
all your distributions you take are
taxfree so I do this exact same thing
with with one of the companies I run so
I pay myself a salary for for what I'm
doing especially for research and
development because I get half of that

[16:00]
development because I get half of that
cost back which is great and then the
rest I just take is a tax redistribution
so you're G have a really low tax rate
and you could be paying be taxfree maybe
on 150 of that 200,000 and then just
paying you probably still be in a lower
bracket at that point at 50 Grand so
whatever that might be maybe in the
teams so that can pencil out quite well
and then when you take any other aspects
of the business that could be done from
here even just having your billing
coming and invoice in coming from from
Puerto Rico and structure things
appropriately that's just going to give
you more bottom line at the end of the
day because you're going to pay a lot
less taxes than you would anywhere else
in the states for those services that
can be performed from the island so
that's a natural thing that we'll see is
owners will come down it's already great
but then they realize oh well if we hire
accountants customer service assistance
whatever marketing do all that from
Puerto Rico then they're actually saving
a lot more money and viously as an owner
can take more out if they want to or

[17:01]
can take more out if they want to or
reinvest it so if I'm paying 30% federal
income tax then that just goes away so
yeah 60 Grand a year let's say that goes
away and then in addition I'm able to
bring my 200,000 a year in net profit to
say at 250 because I'm saving
money right so then effectively you're
saving $75,000 dollar a year yeah then
you can add on that if you applied for
the individual incentive
then as the owner if you ever think that
you'd exit from that
company the nice thing is from the time
you become a Bonafide resident here in
Puerto Rico um until the time you sell
that time let's say you were running the
company for five years and then you ran
it for five more years living here half
of that from the time you move just kind
of like a half split half of that sale
price of whatever you sell the company
for would also be taxfree to you so
if you have an Exit Plan that's a huge

[18:02]
if you have an Exit Plan that's a huge
thing to also take into account many
people will think oh well I'll wait
until I'm about to have my exit in the
two days before I moved that's not how
it works like you do need to actually
have time here living and things like
that so the sooner you get here the
better especially if you have that so I
do have a friend he just had I think it
was like a nine figure exit rolling up
services businesses and other things
around the world like Consulting
practices and stuff like that I don't
know if there's much physical businesses
or not but so he had moved here and been
to structure things and I think at the
end of the day even though he had
started at State Side he like 70% of all
of his stuff he was able to get taxfree
instead of like 50 or 40 or whatever it
would have ended up being so that's like
phenomenal yeah so it if you're willing
to think and plan ahead you can you can
structure things appropriately and have
a really good setup um and and we had
that on our end but we had sold to a New
Zealand organization so out of the
United States but because for tax

[19:01]
United States but because for tax
reasons only Puerto Rico is considered
foreign for everything else we like a
state but for taxes foreign we have our
own tax code things like that so for
that specific instance we didn't have to
pay like a federal exit tax for selling
out of the US or anything because for
taxes we were already out of the us so
we had all the benefits of having like
IP protections and patents and
everything in the us but we didn't have
any of the downside from the federal tax
burden so that I didn't actually fully
under understand that when we were first
setting it up so it just kind of like a
bonus that they also didn't know we'd
sell to a New Zealand organization
either but but when I I found that out
I'm like oh wow this is great and then
when we sold that that was just taxed as
like a regular um business activity so
if you have a 2% or 4% tax rate um it
would just be taxed at that so not even
at any capital gains tax rates or
anything just at like your really low
rate which is one last thing I'll say on
that front because I think this is
useful for a lot of the business owners

[20:00]
useful for a lot of the business owners
and in this case you're talking about
well let's say a million Topline um
200,000 bottom line there's when you're
applying if you know what to do it's not
in your face but if you know what to
reference in the incentives code and
you're making less than $3 million a
year in your business um you can
actually secure a 2% corporate tax rate
for the next five years so 4 perc's
already good that's the Baseline but you
could secure a 2%
um as long as you're not making more
than three million that first year when
you move and set up on the island so
that's another great one that most
people Overlook and don't even find out
about till after the fact and then
they're annoyed wow geeez Louise now
what what about like the potential
downsides are there any cost of living
increases that you could expect or just
cultural differences that are like way
outside of the norm yeah so so some of
the biggest things cultural is going to
be something I think a lot of it can be

[21:00]
be something I think a lot of it can be
overcome and again not everyone's going
to move their family or business to an
island those who tend to tend to be of a
different breed I say a little more open
to collaborate higher risk tolerance
more willing to network things like that
it's really important to kind of find a
group and also know that all over in
Ireland there's still 3.2 million people
that's more than like 20 different
states so like there's different pockets
and areas you want to go to you can't
just assume oh I'm moving here because
my friend said that's a good spot and
then that's how all of Puerto Rico is so
I've had friends who have actually moved
off the a or moved here maybe not
listened to advice we gave them to maybe
find a community or spot first got like
their dream home in the mountains or on
the ocean or something but then realized
that wasn't a good fit their kids didn't
like it because there wasn't anyone to
play with or whatever so I I I would
prioritize finding and and testing out
the different areas what type of
lifestyle you want because there are
different groups and Beats life Mountain
life suburbs City all the other stuff

[22:01]
life suburbs City all the other stuff
just like anything so that's one the
other on the cost side Dairy like milk
is more expensive here than most of the
State Side areas and yogurt and things
like that cars are going to cost more
since we're an island there's import
taxes essentially cars cost probably 15%
more here uh than State side because we
have to handle we have limited space so
we don't want too many cars just riding
around on the island but um so that's
one thing that will be more you're going
to again a lot will depend where in the
country you're coming from uh we're
going to cost more in the metro area
than maybe some of the cheaper parts of
the continental US for housing and
things but that's just going to be again
the more more populated popular areas
but we're going to be way cheaper than
most major cities as well and if you go
just outside of the metro area you can
get phenomenal deals like real life
example the first house we got we're in
guabo which is right next to San Juan
but we were in the mountains like a

[23:00]
but we were in the mountains like a
block into the rural part which still is
six minutes from crispy K cream and 8
minutes from Costco but we we rented a
house with an acre had a big pool
gazebos nine different fruit trees
chicken cooped all sorts of stuff
two-bedroom two bath upstairs
two-bedroom one bath downstairs with
separate entrances so it could airb and
be I had that whole thing I think it
after like paying for the pool and the
yard cleaning and everything it was like
1,600 bucks a month um
which was phenomenal it's more now
admittedly prices have gone up since
seven years ago but you can still find
some really good deals especially
outside of the metro area and if you if
you don't have to live right on the
ocean front because of course that's
going to cost more and we have locks of
ocean fronts are there any cities or
neighborhoods that are good for expats
to live yeah although technically we're
not expats because it's still the us but
but those who are transplanted here
there are some some different ones again
depends what you like I live in a
community it's gated not like super
ritzy or anything like that it's called

[24:01]
ritzy or anything like that it's called
Camino delmare right along the coast has
a probably like only like 10 maybe 15%
of the people are maybe from the states
but there's a good mix and there's of
different professionals very Community
Centric we have two parks and kids can
freely play outside and and it's safe
and things like that higher end areas
like Dorado that's also where like Ricky
Martin and Peter Schiff and a bunch of
other people live so depending where
you're looking that's definitely an
Dorado that a lot of people go to of
course in San Juan there's different
neighborhoods kandado sour especially if
you want more of the up andc coming
start upy artsy type area Miramar is
nice hatto is a business dis District
then you have on the Southeast side
palus delmare is like a mega Community
with a bunch of smaller communities of
all different types within it and they
have their own like Marina and grocery
stores and school and things like that
those are good those who love surfing go
to the West Side so everyone has their

[25:01]
to the West Side so everyone has their
own thing but there's a lot of different
spots but you definitely want to look
around um and and know that just Landing
one day for a vacation or something does
not tell you the story of Puerto Rico or
how like half of our econom is
manufactured most people don't know that
or that we make more biomedical than the
next two states in the US combined and
stuff like that so there's actually a
very robust ecosystem here especially
for an island yeah okay well this is a
lot like this is is a lot of really
really valuable info Brian thank you for
sharing where can people find you or or
