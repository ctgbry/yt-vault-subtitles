[00:00]
a lot of times people get one idea and
they just get fixated on it cuz like
they don't get a lot of business ideas
naturally and so when they do get one
that's good and I do think this is a
good idea they obsess over it and they
go all in on it but they're just
obsessing over it because that happens
to be like their idea it doesn't mean
that it's the best idea that they should
[Music]
start Corey hey Chris how are you good
how are you man I'm doing pretty good
good thank you for coming on and as I
understand it you're curious about a
kayak rental
business yeah just that business model
in general I was intrigued by the tweet
that you posted and I had some ideas
about just that business model in
general so yeah I got intrigued by the
Tweet you posted I'm a sucker for ideas
so let's hear them absolutely yeah so
there's you can buy those pods and
typically right now there's these pods
that are used you've probably seen the
Amazon pickup boxes or

[01:00]
Amazon pickup boxes or
things like that they're used at
apartment complexes and places like that
but they also have the ability to be
used in other ways they're just not I
guess being used that way in my current
role we sell them to apartment complexes
but the manufacturer has talked about
wanting to find other ways to use those
type of
PODS so my idea is there's two ways you
can take it you can put things in or you
can take things out so you can put
things in at the gates of baseball
basketball football games concerts
anywhere they have restricted access for
bag size so for for example you go to
the gate and they're like oh your bag's
not clear it's too big it's whatever
then you walk over to a kiosk you rent
uh a thing for $10 for example you put
your bag in it because I used to work
the gate at football games at University
of Kentucky and at those games we would
have people with thousand Louis Vuitton
purses and they would just hide them
behind a bush and hope they were there
when they came out of the game what and
then they would come out of the game and
security had dogs going around the
stadium the whole time so anytime they
found a bag they would just pick it up
and throw it away so there thousands of

[02:00]
and throw it away so there thousands of
dollars a bag getting thrown
away see I thought I was crazy I went to
the the Six Flags water park I forget
the name of it but we forgot our
sunscreen and it was like $23 for a
bottle of sunscreen I was so angry but
we didn't want to and all of the lockers
were full they had lockers they were
full and those were like $20 but I hid
it I hid the sunscreen in a bush and
felt like a mad man hiding $23 worth of
sunscreen in a bush I can't imagine a
thousand purse these would be like girls
that going into the game like college
girls and they would just be like oh
I'll just hide it and I'll come back and
get it and I'd be like it's not going to
be there and they're like well I'll take
the chance and then security would just
come around pick them all up and throw
them all away and I was like well I told
you that was GNA happen so that's one
way you I would think that most places
like that like already have lockers like
why doesn't the stadium at University
did UK yeah we never had lockers I've
been to other stadiums that don't I've
been to lot stadiums that do but the
nice part about these is they're
automated as well like I went a Boston

[03:00]
automated as well like I went a Boston
Red Sox game this summer or earlier this
year and they had a truck parked in the
parking lot it's some third party
company like a box truck that just said
store your stuff here and you just
rented something from them I didn't use
it so I didn't go up to it where was
that at again in Boston in the Red Sox
game and then last year I went to a
Nationals game in May and they had like
old gym lockers rolled out and then they
had like people stand there working say
to walk up you give them their stuff
they'd go put it in a locker for you and
then the end of the night you came back
nice part about these is they're
automated so then somebody could just
type in a code find their locker it pops
open they put their stuff in it close it
and they access it with the code when
they come back do you have any idea how
much these this truck or these old
school lockers are
charging I don't know I I didn't stop by
the truck just because it didn't click
with me until I got inside and then when
I came out it was like a mad rush to get
out of the place so yeah I haven't done
too much research on what they're
charging but even if you charge $10 a
person if you

[04:00]
person if you
take in 1% of 60,000 people that need it
then you're still making you know decent
money yeah so fans who arrive I'm
looking at the Fenway parks's website to
an enterate for a game with a non-p
permitting bag will have the option of
storing their bag for a fee with a
third-party Locker company this Locker
truck is located on top of the lands
down garage across from gate e so
basically any bag bigger than 12 x 12
X6 yep yeah every stadium has bag
policies they have things in place that
need to like that sometimes it's clear
bag sometimes it's size it's different
by Stadium which makes it hard but even
airports you can do in airport there's
tons of people that go through the TSA
line they have things they can't have
they have to throw away get out line put
I went to an airport once where they had
a box where you could put stuff in and
then they would mail it back home to you
which I thought was an interesting model
but I saw that that
is I'll I'll ask you the the obvious
question surely there are already po you

[05:00]
question surely there are already po you
work for one for pods or Locker
companies that offer this why aren't
they at at Fenway Park why aren't they
at UK Stadium I have no idea I haven't
attacked them that part of the model yet
since you know I started this role six
months ago we sell a wide variety of
equipment in the role I'm in that is
just one small piece of the puzzle and
not a piece that we push very heavily as
of right now I've reached out to a
couple people that I used to work with
and then have begun having those
conversations on it's just something
they'd be interested in it's just trying
to find the right person because I
worked in ticketing so then you're
trying to work your way from ticketing
to operations and finding exactly who
would be the contact
but okay so do you know how to Source
these things yeah I have I work with the
manufacturer on how to Source them so
they come from California would that be
a conflict of interest with your job
would you have to disclose that no not
really well it's a familyowned companies
then I work it's my parents so oh there
you go okay cool yeah we Source them
from a manufacturer the that we work so

[06:01]
from a manufacturer the that we work so
it's a weird system there's a a dealer
they deal all kinds of different mail
parts that we buy from them for mail
machines they work with a distributor I
would probably have to disclose it to
them but that would be a conversation
I'd definitely be willing to have with
them I have a good relationship with
them do you think that you would have to
pay someone like Fenway Park to put it
there or it's just like listen this is a
better experience for your fans we are
going to charge them you don't have to
manage anything there's a credit card
reader on the machine just direct them
there from now what put one at every
gate I they you do Revenue share I think
if you Revenue share it with them even
that'd be incentivizing I don't know if
you'd have to necessarily pay a stand
if yeah I'm just wondering if you don't
lead with that right no of course you
could negotiate to that but it's just
like listen this is going to be a better
experience for your fans they're going
to want to come back to more games and
these are really expensive so just let
us put them there and it's pretty shady
to walk over to a box truck and put your
thousand purse in it right that thing
could be gone I was thinking the same
thing the nice part is too with these we
can do we have a company that does full
custom wraps so they can wrap it and

[07:01]
custom wraps so they can wrap it and
make it look like Boston Red Sox you
know oh yeah make it wrap it to where it
looks like it is official and not a box
truck in a parking
lot yeah okay so I think you just need
to get three or four people on the phone
and it's not hard to find the decision
maker here get on LinkedIn hop on the UK
website or Fenway Park try to find like
the facilities manager or whoever and he
might not be the guy but he's for sure
going to know the guy and just have a
casual conversation with him like you
have the strength of already being being
in the industry you're not just like
some college student that like would
like to try this cool idea one day like
you're already doing this right of
course and so I would just not even make
it a sales call and just be like what do
you think man would this work would you
need one at every gate every other gate
and just get his thoughts and that could
be a really really good business like
you said you could make 50 grand every
game right oh absolutely I looked at I
did a couple quick numbers if you got if
you capture like 1% the NFL NBA college
ball MLB Market it's like over it's like

[08:00]
ball MLB Market it's like over it's like
$40
million if you just captured 1% of the
market of everybody go to game every
year and then there's also the model C
people aren doing this yeah there's the
model pulling things out you mean
pulling things out well the kayak rental
so there's something in there that you
get out the pod in my email I said about
like at a camp for example you have a
bunch of PODS there's things in there
there's a water hose if you get your
hose to hook up to the water there's
leveling blocks stairs even things as
simple as chairs yard games then there's
no one working at the camp real they
walk up rent it out of the thing and
then they're getting things out of the
pods as well there
way yeah it's like hey if you don't
return this there's we're going to
charge a card for 200 bucks period
exactly exactly if you don't return this
water hose we're going to charge you 100
bucks or
whatever
yeah yeah I travel the country in an RV
and it's like how many times did we
forget X Y or Z or firewood or whatever
exactly I definitely like your first

[09:01]
exactly I definitely like your first
idea better because there's no inventory
it's just self- sustaining you know
having to refill with hoses and firewood
and all that would be a pain still a
good business model but I like this more
so if I were you I would just I would
try to get a dozen people on the phone
and just write down everything they say
and then you'll know if this is viable
or not yeah absolutely yeah and then
just go for
it that's the point cool man well thanks
for calling I really like this this is
it's fun to to hypothesize about this
business because this is a good business
yeah it is and there's not anything
automated in the industry already so I
appreciate you taking the time and
having me on today and responding to my
email and stuff so I appreciate you
appreciate you put podcast list
to absolutely appreciate you thank you
thanks man yep see you have a good
one Alec what's up bro how are you doing
I am good I've had this idea for a
couple years
now ironically I know you've been in the
crypto space as well this is kind of
when I got the idea to start this thing

[10:00]
when I got the idea to start this thing
so it's a phone case company and I
already have some of that for the mobile
app I already have some of the code
written out but I wanted to display an
LED image on the back with nft
verification on there so you can see
with like multiple chains allow you to
have any picture you want to view of
your family even some gifs as well and
the I wanted the phone case to have two
other functions as well either like a QR
code in the corner right next to where
your cameras are or an NFC
Communications chip so like a link tree
or like a tappy card where people are
like oh what's that phone case oh let me
scan this OR let me tap your phone oh
you have all your socials or whatever
you want could be cash app whatever and
and then to also have a little small
little like clip at the bottom of the
case that allows you to charge your
phone as well so didn't know and I've
had some like I've worked with some
Engineers like third party contractors
they somewhat built some prototypes and
they just didn't fall through they were
going in school and I had other founders

[11:01]
going in school and I had other founders
with the project that I did and I would
say the project died down but you know
everyone just went their own separate
ways I'm stepping out for my tent so
yeah and I've talked to a lot of people
about it they say this is like an
e-commerce type of thing like where your
mind goes and how you just like easily
explain things so where do you see if
this was your business or your idea how
would you approach it what would you
yeah want to do a double-ended question
let me see if I understand it correctly
so it would be a phone case that you
develop manufacturer cell that has like
an integrated charger so you don't need
to take the case off to charge the phone
yes it has an NFC chip in it and it has
like did you say like a screen on it
like yeah like an LED screen so let's
say if you had a board ape or a family
of your picture or your favorite GIF or
meme that like that constantly how some
gifs gets like a little two second video
or whatever picture Y where it's like
full color full display you could see it
on the back have some like a little

[12:00]
on the back have some like a little
small cooling function in there so the
case doesn't overheat keeps your phone
cool at the same time so yeah that's
pretty much it did you say it was a SAS
business too yeah so how it would work
for you to even display your image
you're going to have to download the app
it's a free app obviously and I'm sure
there's ways we could monetize that as
well so you're going to download the app
and there's going to be like profiles
kind of like a Facebook whatever but
it's not going to be like it the main
purpose is not to be a social media
thing it's like just to connect with
other users of the case people who are
into this stuff and um you'll be able to
change whatever image you want and you
could just go there and just display
your
image okay how long have you had this
idea you said you were working on it
with Partners half-heartedly but then
that kind of fell apart now it's just
you I would say two years at least two
years okay and I just started doubling
down I'm sorry I started doubling down
more this year writing more code and I
used language models to write on my code

[13:01]
used language models to write on my code
okay so yeah so coding the app for
portion then right have you ever done
any hardware product before like this no
I have
not so I think that this is a viable
idea I think that people would buy this
and it would work I think it's
interesting and unique especially if you
were to integrate like a an extended
battery pack function to it because you
might need that for the LED screen
anyway unless you just leech off the
phone but but there's a famous saying
that goes Hardware is hard right like
it's really really hard and it's going
to cost two to six times as much as you
think it might cost I think this is too
ambitious of a project I think that you
you have the I mean we've talked for six
minutes but the fact that you're
listening to this podcast and you're
calling in on your lunch break and you
have this drive I think you have what it
takes to be successful at hundreds of
different business ideas and I think
this specific idea is one of the few

[14:00]
this specific idea is one of the few
that you're most likely to fail at
because of the fact that it's so
ambitious and it's hardware and it's
software and it's e-commerce like all
three of those things are hard and
you're putting them all together I want
you to win and be successful and I think
this idea you're less likely to do so
because it's going to take a lot of
money and a lot of time I think you'll
have to raise money and then you've got
to make sure that you can get it
developed and then you got to make sure
that you could sell it it's a yearslong
process
I'm not saying you can't do it I don't
know you very well right you could be
just an absolute killer but I'm speaking
from my own experience and when I bite
off way more than I can chew I'm more
likely to get discouraged and just shy
away from entrepreneurship altogether
whereas if I bite off something much
more manageable and then get a couple
wins in start a business start a bigger
business sell that get a couple wins in
my belt cut a little bit of money in the
bank I think this idea is still going to
be around in 3 to 5 years years I and I

[15:00]
be around in 3 to 5 years years I and I
do think it would work but I think
you're too early with it what do you
think about that I kind of get what
you're saying like I I think I've heard
that quote before and that makes a lot
of sense like you have to integrate all
three of those things and it's like
heinous when I am like kind of like
doing things I'm like okay well I need
to look up like Hardware things and I
need to see like the dimensions and how
much this will cost and this is
obviously this is I haven't seen anyone
with this before so I have to get like a
whole new mold I have to do samples I
have to do different phones I have to
it's like am I going to do e-commerce I
can also like start like you can I'm
only one person I can hustle a lot I can
go to like little U Break iFix like all
the main phone carriers or like phone
repair places and I'm like hey I got
this product we can if I can give them a
cut of the sales I'm like well people
like this if you display it we have some
displays as soon as you come in so it is
a lot and and like I said like everyone
was have hardly doing it and I'm just

[16:00]
was have hardly doing it and I'm just
like the only one who's like really just
stayed on the path just like still
working on this thing kind of yeah so
yeah it's just tough like it's tough
when you have an idea if you're not the
type of person that gets business ideas
every five seconds and that's who I am
right like it's a blessing and a curse
then a lot of times people get one idea
and they just get fixated on it because
like they don't get a lot of business
ideas naturally and so when they do get
one that's good and I do think this is a
good idea they obsess over it and they
go all in on it but they're just
obsessing over it because that happens
to be like their idea it doesn't mean
that it's the best idea that they should
start and I'm glad you said that about
different sizes of phones and phones new
phones coming out every year because you
know I had a I've had a cell phone
business for a decade 2010 to 2019 and
it's brutal there's a lot of people
making cases out there and you're going
to be at the very high end of that
market but you won't have a well-known
brand to support a price like that right
right so I feel like you're picking like
of the hund hardest things out there you

[17:01]
of the hund hardest things out there you
you've got like six of them in this one
idea you know and I just like I want you
to win and I kind of think what you were
saying with you've already done a bunch
of research like that's have you heard
of the sunk cost fallacy what's that
it's like it's this fallacy that people
have where let's say you go into the
casino and you play Blackjack and you
lose $1,000 and you're like d I'm GNA
I'm going I'm going to win it back I'm
going to win it back I'm In Too Deep I'm
I'm going to get it back that's a
fallacy you're like I've already spent
this money so let me just win it back
it's really no different than what an
entrepreneur says if they're like
already way down the line on an idea and
they're like if I quit this then I
wasted all that time so I'm GNA keep
going well that's called the sunk cost
fallacy and it's a fallacy for a reason
because you don't know how much time
this will take into the future or how
much money right so right let's say that
I know you're a couple years into this
but let's say you've worked full-time on
it as in 40 hour week weeks for a year
straight I can't quit because that's all

[18:01]
straight I can't quit because that's all
waste of time first of all that's not
wasted at all that's like an NBA that's
like a very cheap NBA that you've given
yourself so don't count that as wasted
second of all this could take six more
years to to bring to Market or to make a
profit so in that sense if you could
Flash Forward a decade and look back if
you had that luxury you'd be like man if
I would have quit at year one that would
have been really smart uh because I
still had I I I hadn't even tasted
difficulty yet right right
so hope I'm not discouraging you I don't
want to discourage you from
entrepreneurship I just want to give you
a dose of reality on this idea and how
hard it will be from someone who's been
in that exact industry you know yeah no
and I would appreci I didn't I wasn't
expecting anything I just like I knew
you were just going to give me a
different perspective and that does that
makes a lot of sense cuz I'm like mid
20s now um I live in Southern California
live with my wife so it's like do I just
keep spending time in money onto this

[19:00]
keep spending time in money onto this
thing and I'm like oh do I start the
case with just the screen first and then
build that and then keep going and I'm
like and I don't want to marry this idea
because who's to say OtterBox or case
toy or one of these other guys see it
and we like they already have the
resources they're like well we'll just
put this together and we'll just sell it
and we'll just put you out of the market
and I'm like uh it's like yeah
so yeah it's like a lot of times the
best ideas are right in front of us and
we're like looking over them to get to
the idea that we already have yeah I'm
trying to think of an example when I've
done this but you know how to code right
that is a s after rare skill that
enables you to build millions of
different products or apps or pieces of
software or websites that you could sell
for zero cost only your time right so
it's like you're using that valuable
skill that you might take for granted to
build this Hardware when it's like what
if I forget the whole hardware part and
just keep working on the software to
build something else right yeah that

[20:00]
build something else right yeah that
makes sense so yeah if I were you I
would get have you ever heard of Indie
hackers I have not I maybe what can you
it sounds like really familiar Indie
hackers I think it's Indie hackers.com
yeah Indie hackers.com is just like it's
a community of people like you that are
mostly coders entrepreneurial and just
building stuff and it's like a forum
Message Board a Blog all of the above I
would just go start consuming all the
content you can on Indie hackers and
that is going to give you so many ideas
like you're going to read about a guy
who built the Chrome extension that
helps you scrape uh Yelp for Faux
restaurants in Sacramento and you're
like dude I could do that wait he grew a
10 grand mrr in three months what if I
did that for ice cream shops in in San
Francisco it's going to give you all
these ideas and then start actively
posting in there and building a
community and a name for yourself and
then you could find like a marketing
co-founder or another technical
co-founder and it just gets you in the

[21:01]
co-founder and it just gets you in the
game and helps you start building a
community of people that are doing what
you're doing and thinking like you're
thinking and you're going to get a ton
of ideas from them and then you're going
to give ideas to them in the process as
well yeah and especially my area like I
live in Newport Beach California so this
is one of the wealthiest places on the
west coast so I'm like dude I'm like all
these people around here and I'm like
these people are just millionaires just
by net worth in their homes like equity
in their house it's not even what they
have in the bank or their assets so I'm
like how do I like get to them and just
like connect and network and just build
something for myself cuz I'm not I don't
need to be like a millionaire if it's
just like I got a couple Grand like
higher than what I'm making now then
like life would be amazing like I could
buy a house I could like just start a
family and that's just like pretty much
the goal so I didn't want to get stuck
to my business or just like married to
an idea where I'm just like stressing
out cuz I'm like a I'm a man of Fate so
I care about my family still I don't
want to like do all these things and
that's why I appreciate like what you

[22:00]
that's why I appreciate like what you
have to say too like you just you have a
a lot of knowledge in business so and I
know you're a man of faith and you've
knocked on a lot of doors I watched a
lot of your content and so yeah no that
makes sense I have to start doing more
stuff like that just getting my foot out
there my name out there and just
connecting with people yeah I'm going to
send you a video here in the chat of
this guy in somewhere in California it's
not Newport Beach it was like Beverly
Hills or something and he has a startup
and he literally just went door too at
these mansions and asked the person
there will you invest my startup and it
was brilliant and he filmed the whole
thing and now he's like going viral on
Instagram and so now people on Instagram
are like hey that guy at the door didn't
but I will that's a cool idea if you
live in a wealthy area like that you
could totally copy that and do what he's
doing yeah just put it in the chat but
you're going to win man you're asking
the right questions you're doing the
right things I would just keep an open
mind about what you actually launch hey
no I appreciate that cuz it does open my
mind cuz I did you mention it I didn't

[23:01]
mind cuz I did you mention it I didn't
now that you did like I was kind of
close-minded I'm like well I'm married
this is going to work cuz I have a
detailing C detailing business on the
side too I'm like this is going to work
I'm G to be doing this this this and
this is this and this is how I win this
is my ticket and that kind of like does
make sense and because I do talk to some
entrepreneurs out here and they it's
never the same story like they've done a
bunch of things and like you have one in
some few cases where it's like okay they
did this they hit the the lottery not
the lottery but they hit it and then
they just went with it but it's all
different so yeah okay yeah don't the
survivorship bias is listening to
stories of people that made it and
thinking like the movie uh Pursuit of
Happiness with Will Smith have you seen
that yeah yeah great movie right he
slangs these Healthcare machines barely
makes it he he sleeps on the floor I
know I know this is sick I'm like people
would love this this is going to be a
great product it's a great movie but
they don't make movies about all the
will Smiths out there 100 to one that

[24:01]
will Smiths out there 100 to one that
fail they don't make movies about them
yeah you know so that's survivorship
bias that's like all right I could do
that but like that he is the outlier
right that's the outlier so C deal
detailing is another thing you could be
looking right over right like just
looking right through something that
could be a huge opportunity that you're
already doing don't let pride get in the
way either right there's no idea that's
too small especially if you're trying to
provide for your family so okay
all right man heck yeah bro no problem
all right good luck have a good one man
thank you you too you too
bye so you are tiffany yes okay I want
to hear everything you got going on and
thank you for coming on by the way thank
you for having me absolutely we don't
get very many female callers so I always
love it when we do oh awesome
yeah so what are you dealing with yes so
I bought a business
business last summer I was looking for a

[25:02]
business last summer I was looking for a
business for a while like probably a few
years and I ended up with this one that
I bought it was supposed to replace the
income of my current job that pays very
well so it was supposed to replace my
income I did all the due diligence I had
a lawyer I had an accountant I had a
broker you did everything right yeah we
were also going through the SBA so the
SBA did all their due diligence for
months like we did due diligence for a
very long time the day after the closing
of the business we found out that pretty
much
everything the previous owner told us
was a lie there was supposed to be like
seven employees the day after the
closing of the business he told me there
was no employees anymore they walked out
months ago he never told us he even gave
us like documents like he gave my
account in documents saying here is all

[26:02]
account in documents saying here is all
the employees their salary their job
titles their start date like this is how
many hours a week they work and this was
all after they all walked out on him and
he didn't tell us real quick are were
you not able to validate this because he
was saying something like I don't want
to Spook the employee so I'd rather you
not meet them until after close was that
kind of his and that's a normal reason
right that shouldn't even be a red flag
to you right so when I originally went
to the business so we were doing du
diligence for so long I believe we
started in February and the closing of
the business wasn't until August when I
originally went to go see the business
all the employees were there they were
working everything looked smooth and
well-run and it was fine and then I went
another time like a month or two later
everyone was still there so I thought
everything was fine and then he a couple
months later he gave us all the
documents for the employees said that
they still work there and we didn't know
a month before that they walked out um
um so then that was just the tip of it

[27:01]
um so then that was just the tip of it
that was when it started the day after
and then the day after it was officially
closed and then I said to him well I
like you need to hire new people like I
bought a business with seven employees
and he was like oh no I'm not gonna hire
anyone like you need to do that and I'm
like no how am I gonna do that when you
didn't train me yet so I don't know yeah
I like and that was the other thing like
when we first the day after closing when
we had our meeting it was like the It
was supposed to start training that day
like virtually and the very first thing
he said to me was okay so what do you
want to know and I was like everything
like what do you mean and he was like
yeah but you don't need to know
everything right just like name some
things you want to know about and I was
like no like you need to show me how to
run the whole business that's what
you're getting paid for now so show me
how to run the business and he just
didn't have anything planned he didn't
know what to tell me he literally told
us like multiple times that all the
employees were there they were running
the business everything was great and

[28:00]
the business everything was great and
they were not there that whole time so C
can you tell me the industry to help
provide some context I'd love to know
the average like the just a range of
Revenue or profit that at least that you
expected in the industry and a rough
geography and be as broad as you like
yeah so it's placed in New Jersey it is
a custom merch like promotional product
business and he claimed that the revenue
was
$750,000 so mind you he gave us all
these p&l statements and and the
accountants went over it the SBA went
over it the banks went over it and
everything looked fine and then
obviously the day after closing you're
not going to realize how much revenues
coming in or out so it was probably like
a couple weeks after and then my
accountant did the first month of the
p&l statements and he sent it to me I'm
like this doesn't look right I was like
why is this so much lower than what his
always was and he was like we went

[29:01]
always was and he was like we went
through it multiple times like this is
what you brought in and this is like
everything and they were reconciling
with the bank and they had all the info
they needed yep so he didn't show me how
to use anything I basically had to
figure it all out on my own and I hired
three I was able to find three employees
that came on and he basically didn't
train them either like we all had to
figure things out on our own all he did
was set my email up to replace his email
so that if anyone emailed him it would
just go right to me and I guess he
didn't realize that means I would also
have access to his old emails so I
found emails from him and his accountant
like his accountant sent him the p&l
statements to send us and they were not
the same p&l statements he sent us he
changed them yeah the p&l statements
directly from his accountant were very
in the negative and he the ones he sent
us
were very in the positive so now what

[30:01]
were very in the positive so now what
did he change them from to what were
they actually versus what did he show
you so I don't have the numbers right in
front of me just a rough estimate so he
sent us in June he sent us the first
half of the year for well I guess it was
July he sent us January to June from
last year and he said that the cash flow
like after paying all the employees
after taking his salary like all
expenses it was positive $300
,000 and
then that's what he sent us and then
when I found the one from the accountant
after all expenses it was like negative
$150,000 oh my
goodness yeah it wasn't even a sellable
business right not at all and then
probably like a couple weeks in I found
out that he sold equipment that was
supposed to be included and then I
started getting all these calls from
vendors that he didn't pay so because
their all the employees walked out he

[31:01]
their all the employees walked out he
had to start Outsourcing everything and
so a lot of the customers he just was
ignoring he wasn't even answering he was
just like well I'm selling it in a
couple weeks so he just wasn't being
bothered but then some of them he was
Outsourcing and then he never paid those
vendors to for the work that they did so
then they were reaching out to me you
need to pay this like you already got
the stuff I've been keep putting my own
personal money into it every month and I
can't even quit my job to take over the
employees positions because one I wasn't
trained on anything and two they're were
still negative so like I the only it
wouldn't make sense I wouldn't be able
to take their income anyway yeah first
of all you got the lwuit going which was
great we won't even talk about that
because you're already working on that
what are your options what would you
prefer to do in a in a perfect world if
you could turn this around cuz you've
got run away you've got hide you've got
get a job you've got shut it all down
declare bankruptcy You' got turn it
around grow it paid marketing what do

[32:01]
around grow it paid marketing what do
you want to do and what do you think are
the options in front of you the most
realistic
ones yeah so I've tried to do some
marketing but again like I can only do
so much because we're already negative
so I can't put out a ton of money on
that I have talked to the lawyer about
bankruptcy but we're trying to go
through with the court dates and all the
lawsuit before we actually go through
with that to see if it's necessary I
just don't see how it's like realistic
to raise the revenue that much in the
amount of time that we would need it to
be raised that much so if you can't then
what do you think you'll have to do and
then let's talk about how you might be
able to so right now I'm just waiting
for the court dates and the lawsuit and
say that doesn't go in my favor for
whatever reason I don't really see how
it can't but say it doesn't I think like
my only option would be to try to sell
the business and who's going to want it
the only thing I'm thinking is if I sell
it to another similar business that

[33:00]
it to another similar business that
might want like the equipment and the
customers that we do have and they would
have to get rid of their employees
because they're going to already have
employees but it's not gonna like
someone who's not in the industry isn't
going to buy the business when it's
negative yeah are are you able in the
chat here to message me the domain name
and I'll I'll keep it private I would
really like to look at at the website
just to see exactly what you do yeah all
right there it is yep is it screen
printing mostly
C custom merch so yeah it's specialized
in screen printing apparel but we do
everything embroidery we can do pens
postcards literally anything and what's
up with the two locations
here so yeah that's the other thing with
a little sketchy so it is just in Jersey
he claimed that he was opening another
location at the other one
and it turns out like he wasn't he was
just making that up and then he also
claimed that he was franchising it and

[34:01]
claimed that he was franchising it and
then we found out that also wasn't true
so that other location does not exist
it's we keep trying to take it off and
there's like issues with the website but
it is just the one location how long had
he been in business and how did he
acquire the customers that he has so
that's the so mind you I'm just getting
this from him and he hasn't been
truthful about 95% of the stuff so this
is just what I'm hearing from him it was
he started it in 2018 and apparently he
did no marketing or anything he just it
was like Word of Mouth
his dad is in the same industry so his
dad got him customers and that's the
other like there his dad is well known
in the area and that's the other thing
both of
them I don't know what he's trying to do
yeah so he claims he he launched in 2018
it's always just been organic as far as
acquiring customers goes
that's how he framed it yeah he told us

[35:01]
that's how he framed it yeah he told us
there was no marketing so there was
plenty of room to grow and all this
stuff but I'm not sure how accurate that
is anymore yeah and what does your
average customer look like how much are
they spending is it a school is it a
what type of person is it yeah so we do
quite a few schools and like recreation
centers you that work with like team
sports and stuff and then we do
businesses a lot of businesses like
landscape bang construction workers
stuff like that and then we'll also do
like smaller things where people just
want like a sweatshirt for their
grandson or something but most of our
stuff is like bigger businesses like ice
cream shops construction places
Landscaping school stuff like that okay
and have you been able to when did you
close again like when did this all go
down last
August okay so you've been at this for a
while then so you started in February of
2023 due diligence losted 6 months

[36:00]
2023 due diligence losted 6 months
closed in August found out about all
this in August and you've just been like
trying to keep your head above water
yeah ever since so I'm looking at the
web Archive of his domain name and it
looks like it was launched in 2023 2021
it was a parked domain early 2000s the
domain was used for the tattoo shop
there was nothing indexed on the website
in 2022 for this business which is very
rare yeah yeah un I don't know unless he
just I don't know why he would just
start the website right before he put it
up for sale right I guess he did
one honestly it looks like he did I'm
looking at who is.com the URL and who
is.com and it uh so registered on in
2021 so like it looked like this domain
was active in the early 2000s someone
let it expire it was registered again at
the very end of 2021 so basically
2022 and then it wasn't really people

[37:01]
2022 and then it wasn't really people
weren't really doing anything with it
until 2022 and then 2023 is when Google
started indexing it uh and it back then
it looked like what it looks like now
but it looks like he just built this as
a front to sell it like as a frog yeah
it seemed like what we've been like
finding is that like he seemed it seemed
like he right before he listed it he
put all these things in place to make it
look more legit than it was yeah how
many customers do you have probably like
a weekly basis we might have five to 10
customers on a weekly basis okay some of
them repeat some of them not and what is
your monthly Revenue nowadays me bring
that up it varies because it is a very
like seasonal so like right now is our
slower season because it's summer so
like schools aren't doing anything so it
does vary so let me see what last month

[38:01]
does vary so let me see what last month
brought us in are any drugs involved
with this seller is he like addicted to
gambling or do you know of anything like
that not that I know of but I guess I
think possible at this
point so my guess is like you said his
dad's in the industry they probably know
the industry really well they speak the
language I bet you anything that he
started this business with the intent of
it actually being a business launch
didn't really go well he cobbled
together some customers he didn't like
what the numbers looked like and then
just being completely uncaring
psychopath sociopath just lied faked
everything he could to get some money
out of it and then was just totally cool
lying to anyone about anything because
he saw six figures coming into his bank
account in the near future yeah so last
month it was the revenue was 28,000
[Music]
owner's name start with a B yes okay the

[39:01]
owner's name start with a B yes okay the
month before was like
30,000 so I guess around that this time
of year and what are your margins
like last month our total cost of goods
sold
was
9700 okay so 65% gross margins give or
take 30 grand topl line 10 grand in cogs
basically I guess so yeah okay so then
out of that 20 grand left you're paying
employees I imagine you have your
expensive rent overhead Etc yeah okay
yeah and then we have to pay like the
vendors like monthly cost and then the
graphic design service that's like
pretty expensive monthly so payroll
itself is 10,000 a month minimum okay
wow okay so that's half your gross
profit how much are you paying the
graphic design
company they are 2,000 a month and is
like an agency yes how many different

[40:01]
like an agency yes how many different
like designs are you making are you
having them make every month so it's our
package is like 50 a month and we've
never really gone over it so it's around
like 50 a month 50 designs for
$2,000 yeah it's not a virtual assistant
it's a us-based
company yeah okay I would see if you can
find someone on upwork to do it like on
a per design basis I get my thumbnails
designed on YouTube for $7 each pretty
good okay I think you could really cut
at least $1,000 a month that might not
sound like a lot but it's something is
there an option to where you could find
a bigger competitor that is doing
literally a hundred times the volume of
you and they have much lower cost and
you can just sub everything out to them
and just keep your business going but
fire your employees just be like not
have overhead not have rent and just
basically is a common model in the
screen printing industry anyway just sub

[41:00]
screen printing industry anyway just sub
everything out just be the marketing and
the sales arm is that viable yeah so we
have
a place who does like our bigger stuff
now that like we can't handle in house
so I guess I could Outsource everything
through them but my only concern with
that is we have to every time we do
Outsource to them we have to raise our
prices just to cover cost and so that I
can cover some of the expenses that we
have and we already lose some customers
when we raise our cost but I guess if I
I can't get rid of all the employees
because I wouldn't be able to handle
that workload and work my job yeah so
you still have your full-time job yes
okay what has your lawyer said about
going public about this or talking about
this he definitely advised against it
what about talking to your customers
transparently about this situation and
pleading your cause to them
so some of them don't even seem to

[42:00]
so some of them don't even seem to
realize that he sold the business and a
lot of them seem to have only been
getting from like purchasing from the
business because they know his dad
and so I don't know if we start saying
things about the previous owner they're
going to be like well I don't want to be
involved because I'm friends with his
dad so right there's no way this guy
would even have this business if it
weren't for his dad it sounds like oh
there's yeah there's it so his daddy
just fed him these leads and he's like
all right you start a business son and
then he screwed it up he just sold it
and his dad's like yeah it's literally
in the same building that we're in and
he's right next to us so it's very
awkward now yeah and his dad definitely
doesn't want to hear our side and he
just listens to all the lies that his
son's feeding him and it's very awkward
now yeah I'm sorry how much term do you
have left on your
lease oh it's a fiveyear lease so F how
much is Left four years in the month and

[43:01]
much is Left four years in the month and
how much is your rent per month
2,000 okay and then we had to and then
the loan for the SBA was 4,000 a month
and we put that on pause thankfully they
were understanding for the time being
because we could not afford it like I
was paying that out of my pocket every
single month and like I have my own
bills to pay like I have a mortgage on
my house and everything yeah so luckily
they put that on pause until the lawsuit
but if again if we don't win the lawsuit
I'm going to have to start paying that
back
yeah okay as you having two options
right now I've been involved with
lawsuits with business partners two and
they were both terrible just terrible
one of them ended okay financially the
other one did not you can't just and I
know you know this but you can't just
wait it out right and I know you're
running the business and you're doing
everything you can but I feel like
you've either got to go hard like just
jump in fee and that doesn't necessarily
mean quit your job because I don't want
you to do that but I feel like you just

[44:01]
you to do that but I feel like you just
need to grab this by the horns and take
some courses uh learn because the the
good thing for you is the merch business
the screen printing business is very
common and there's a lot of really smart
courses out there about how to grow how
to acquire customers how to be creative
how to do print on demand how to partner
with third-party logistics companies
that sell t-shirts they don't want to
print them and you can print them and
they can ship them or vice versa I I
feel like you you could do a lot in the
way of learning Google and Facebook ads
take a $50 course follow some YouTubers
and really just try to grow hard while
you wait for this lawsuit to play out
because if you don't do that then it's
just going to languish and languish and
shrink and shrink and shrink and shrink
and shrink and your problems will get
worse so I feel like either you need to
go all in both feet with learning how to
grow this business or you need to just
sever it like today and just cut ties
walk away from the lease and just
swallow it and just be done with it or

[45:01]
swallow it and just be done with it or
else your life is just going to be a
living hell right
yeah what do you think about that we
just can't afford to put like a lot of
money into them and that's like the only
issue I would definitely love to grow it
and then it would work out but if it
can't grow significantly and like
probably by the end of the year like I'm
going to have
to probably sell it or something
okay here's what I think you should do
with regards to Growing it I think you
should look at all your customers I
think you should do a bunch of market
research on your competitors and find
out what type of customer is the best
customer maybe it's a high school sports
team maybe it's an HVAC business I have
no idea restaurant I don't know find out
that like 10 to 20 different industries
that make for really repeat high volume
customers and then I want you to go to
outscar and it costs
and I want you to scrape hundreds or
thousands of those types of customers

[46:02]
thousands of those types of customers
it's very easy I've got tutorials online
I'm happy to send you a link afterwards
and then and I'll show you how to do all
this so it's going to sound maybe
overwhelming but I'll email you all this
info and then you want to scrub out all
the landlines and then you want to send
them a mass text that to the business
owner and I was doing this yesterday not
for t-shirts of course but for something
else and it works amazingly and just say
hey this is my name here's where I am I
I I just bought this business and I
would tell them like I would tell them
in a general way like I'm in a really
tough spot due to something that is not
my fault and I'm trying to grow my way
out of it and just pitch them that story
like I know you're buying t-shirts I
would love to have your next order is
there anything you can do can I 10
shirts 10 hats 50 hats 100 hats like I
think you'll really be surprised at our
quality our prices yada y y I'll hand
deliver it what do you think now there's
a strategic way to give that pitch
that's not like your first text I would
start the text by qualifying them saying

[47:01]
start the text by qualifying them saying
hey do you still own XY or Z business
and then just try to like tell them your
story it's a unique story right like you
can use that negative occurrence to your
advantage you don't want to go shout it
from the roof rooftops because you don't
want to get counter sued or whatever um
but you can tell them that you're
dealing with something really tough
right now due to something that is
outside of your control and you're
selling a commodity right and so usually
that's looked at as a negative use that
as a positive right like oh we're just
selling a commodity so it's a race to
the bottom no we're selling a commodity
which means everyone buys it right
everyone buys my thing and so they're
either gonna buy it from me or from
someone else so you need to have at
least if not a better story than someone
else a different story that's from the
heart and I I know that some people will
resonate with it it's just a numbers
game maybe it's 1% maybe it's 30% but
you've got to put a lot more Hooks In
The Water right you got to put yourself
out there and your story out there as

[48:01]
out there and your story out there as
much as will not you know get you sued
yeah so I me and I have the employees
doing it every single day reaching out
to businesses but we haven't
tried that method of just being honest
about why we need to raise the
revenue I mean I won't be like fully
transparent about all the details but
yeah we could definitely try that method
and yeah I would if you could send me
that information on how to do use that
website I would definitely start it
today I will absolutely do that thank
you yeah I'm sorry Tiffany that sucks
I've been there but I just know you're
going to look back on this and you're G
to I would not be here if I weren't ever
there right and that was terrible and
there was no good way out of that but
because of that I learned this and now
I'm here and I wouldn't have changed
anything right it's like impossible to
see that right now and if someone would
have told me that when I was in the do
rooms I would have said get out of my
face don't talk to me right but like
it's true it's the most cliche thing

[49:01]
it's true it's the most cliche thing
ever but everything happens for reasons
like multiple reasons like not just one
not just because this is going to lead
you to an awesome opportunity but a
dozen different things and it sucks but
just take a long-term approach to it and
you're going to be more weathered you're
going to be more resilient and you're
going to this is going to force you to
learn skills that you never really want
to learn but that are really good to
learn and you'll be better off for it
but all that to be said I'm sorry like
it's terrible and it sucks and I've been
there thank you you're welcome well you
can email me anytime Chris at cofounders
decom and and I'm happy to help thank
you so much no problem have a good day
you too bye bye
