let me show you why remote work is not
the future okay every half hour or so I
have to come back to this fire and keep
pushing the coals back together pushing
them back together why because if I
don't the fire will go out if you put an
ice cube on the counter it's going to
melt if you put a bunch of other ice
cubes buy it they'll stay cold for a
long time that's the same thing with
remote work if you want to optimize for
working in your underwear grabbing
snacks anytime you want then work from
home I pay $11,000 a month to go into an
office with business owners that are in
my same sphere that challenge me that
are smarter than me and I have added a
double digit percentage to my net worth
because of things that I've learned from
them in serendipitous conversations in
the break room I would not have learned
these things on slack or in the
metaverse so if you want to optimize for
a fulfilling life for more net worth
then go into the office if you want to
work from your underwear then stay at
home follow me for more
