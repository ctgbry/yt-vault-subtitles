picture this in your mind's eye for a
moment all you own is $20,000 to your
name and a dream your dream is to build
seven Scandinavian cabins on a beautiful
piece of land outside of Waco Texas you
don't have any money you don't have a
plan you haven't done any market
research until one day that land hits
the market you go look at it the day
it's listed you fall in love with it it
has huge live oak trees you still don't
have any money you get under contract
not knowing what you're going to do a
year later you built all seven cabins
you broke your pelvis you built a spec
home to raise money for it you're open
you're crushing it everything's going
great and then Airbnb cancels you but
then you find Direct booking through
your own website but then 2 years after
that you sell this business for $7
million to private Equity you put $4.7
million of dollar in your pocket of net
profit
