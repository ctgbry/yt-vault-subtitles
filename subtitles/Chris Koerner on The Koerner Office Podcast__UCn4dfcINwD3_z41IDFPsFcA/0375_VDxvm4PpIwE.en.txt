[00:00]
I earn anywhere from like $8 to $12,000
a month supporting families when I first
started I think I charged for25 but it's
now a year two I was making just as much
money as I was in my event planning
career I have somebody he was doing
$40,000 a month if my friends need help
I'm more than happy to help them for
free I'm sure you hear all the time
parents are just like they just throw
their hands up and like yeah my kids
just don't sleep and you're like they
could they
[Music]
could thank you so much for having me my
name is Jane Havens I am a mom of two
kids I live in Baltimore Maryland with
my husband and my kids I have a former
background in event planning and
Catering sales and I left a really
successful job to stay at home when my
son was born 12 years ago I was raised
by a stay-at home mom and it was
literally my dream to just be first in
line carpool have the best snacks take

[01:02]
line carpool have the best snacks take
them to lacrosse practice and ballet
recital like that's all I ever wanted to
do and and I did it I did it for four
years and then my daughter was born and
the second time around with stay-at-home
mom life was trickier my daughter was
colicky and cranky and just not the most
fun baby to be around and at that point
I was ready to get back into the Work
World in some capacity and and I
couldn't figure out what that was going
to look like because I was just so used
to doing everything for my kids and
being the primary caregiver and being so
Hands-On that the idea of like going
back to work and hiring a nanny or
putting them in daycare just felt really
outside of my comfort zone so I was
thinking about what am I good at what
can I do from home while taking care of
my two kids and the one thing I actually
was really good at was getting my kids
to sleep when my son was born 12 years

[02:01]
to sleep when my son was born 12 years
ago he was originally a really solid
sleeper out of the gate and then he hit
what's known as the 4mon sleep
regression at about 16 weeks right when
he was four months old and he went from
sleeping through the night to waking up
every single hour like on the dot and as
a new parent I was clueless I had no
idea why this was happening and I this
was before Facebook groups this was
before there was so much information
online so I literally was sitting on the
floor of Barnes & Noble trying to figure
this out and long story short I figured
it out what was going on is I had been
rocking him to sleep and giving him his
pacifier and then he'd wake up an hour
later and his pacifier wasn't in his
mouth he'd want to be rocked back to
sleep or to pop the paci back in and so
I needed to teach him how to fall asleep
without so much help so that when he
would Rouse in the middle of the night
he could get himself back to sleep
without so much help and so that's what
I did I implemented some sleep training
got him sleeping through the night it
was really transformative for me as a

[03:01]
was really transformative for me as a
mother for my husband like we were so
sleep deprived and we were wrecked and
you know implementing a little bit of
sleep training just changed our lives
and it was empowering and amazing and
frankly all my friends were jealous they
wanted me to help them sleep train their
kids and so like for years I was just
helping friends and Friends of Friends
get their kids to sleep it was sort of
it was a hobby of mine I wasn't getting
paid to do it I wasn't formally trained
but when it came time to going back to
work that's sort of what came to my mind
was like I'm going to be a sleep
consultant so I went online I took a
certification course I really wanted to
make sure that I had the proper training
even though I felt like I was already
really good at it I wanted to make sure
that I you don't know what you don't
know right so went online took a course
got certified what was intended to be a
side hustle turned into a really
lucrative and successful career by year
two I was making just as much money as I

[04:01]
two I was making just as much money as I
was in my event planning career being
home with my two kids and supporting
families virtually through sleep
training and yeah that's how I got
started wow okay lots of questions first
of all how important is it to be
certified like did people ask for that
or was it just good to proactively tell
them that you were so there's no
governing body that regulates the field
sleep Consulting is unregulated you can
definitely work as a sleep consultant
without having formal training that
being said there's so much to learn
there's so much to know and I do believe
that being certified will make you far
better at your job so I think it's
incredibly valuable both from a sleep
perspective but also from a business
perspective you know getting certified
will teach you how to properly coach
clients successfully how to write them a
written plan how to communicate
effectively it all around I say I say
it's important and how much did it cost

[05:00]
it's important and how much did it cost
and how long did that take you so when I
enrolled in a certification course I
believe I paid about 22 $2,400 something
in there and I finished in about four or
five weeks it was a pretty quick process
okay and were you in like a community
with of other people doing it or was it
just you I was there wasn't a cohort
there was a community you know it's open
enrollment so you could sign up whenever
you wanted you got dumped into a
Facebook group you could ask questions
inside of the group and just move
through the course at your own pace I
think some people move through these
trainings really quickly and others take
longer okay so was it hard to transition
from you know the feel-good aspect of
helping your friends I'm sure that feels
amazing to help them get more sleep was
it hard to transition from that to hey I
actually charge for this now and what
did that look like yeah so I don't
charge my friends for help with sleep if
my friend friends need help I'm more

[06:01]
my friend friends need help I'm more
than happy to help them for free that
being said as I've gotten busier in my
business I do have to set some
boundaries around what it what it looks
like to help friends but you know any of
my friends who are struggling with sleep
I'm happy to get onto a phone call with
them and chat it out for 30 or 40
minutes and give them whatever advice
they need if they want actual coaching
and accountability and support then I
will treat them as a real client and
charge them for services just like I
would anybody else
but I will say that I definitely built
my business off the backs of friends of
friends so I spent years supporting my
actual friends for free just because I
enjoyed it and it made me happy to help
them and then when it came time to
launch my business all those people who
I had helped for years were more than
happy to share my name with their
friends who were people that were not
necessarily in my inner circle okay now
let's talk unit economics what is what

[07:00]
let's talk unit economics what is what
does an average I don't know what to
call it job or customer look like for
you how long does it last what do your
margins look like or is it literally
just your time and what do you charge
sure so I have two options for services
the primary service that I offer is a
virtual two- week consultation this
consultation includes a written plan
which is customized for the family's
unique set of circumstances it includes
a 30 minute phone call to onboard them
and answer their questions and make sure
they feel confident with everything that
I've proposed on paper for them and then
text message support during the daytime
I sleep through the night but they get
daytime communication via text message
and voice note for about two weeks and
then we usually do a wrap-up call at the
end of our time together I charge
$750 for this service when I first
started I think I charged 425 and then I
very quickly inched it up you know it
was 425 then it was 50 then it was 550

[08:01]
was 425 then it was 50 then it was 550
you know I inched it up over the years
but it's now
$750 I also offer a oneoff phone call
it's a quick 30 minute call I call it
and ask me anything and it's primarily
used for repeat clients people who have
been through my twoe consultation but
then either something slips or they're
going through a nap transition or they
just got back from you know a vacation
and things are hard they just want to
get onto a phone call and either have a
pep talk or quick strategy session and I
charge
$145 for that 30 minute phone call I
would say that I earn anywhere from
like8 to 122,000 a month supporting
families via these two Services I
actually used to earn a lot more monthly
than I do now but now I'm focused I
actually train other people to work as
sleep consultant so I'm more focused on
supporting my students than taking on a
bunch of clients but I'm still earning I
would say between and 122,000 a month in

[09:02]
would say between and 122,000 a month in
this business just like supporting
families yeah as far as expenses and my
margins it's a little tricky for me to
answer that because my business is
comingled with my certification program
but to support families is really
inexpensive you know I pay for web
hosting I pay for Acuity which is an
online scheduling platform I have thank
you notes that I mail out so like some
beautiful note cards and postage I send
all of my clients pajamas I send their
kids pajamas at the end of our two-e
contract I get those PJs wholesale I I
spend about n or10 per PJ set and then
the postage to mail them is another you
know $5 doll plus the packaging so you
know I have some expenses but really low
considering I mean most of it is just my
time okay and how much time like if you
were to average it out in that during
that two we Peri how many hours would

[10:00]
that two we Peri how many hours would
you say you're spending per client so
you know it's a written sleep plan which
I've gotten really good at writing these
plans because I've been doing it for
years I'm not Reinventing the wheel I
have templates and I can access old
plans and just make small tweaks if I'm
really focused I can get a plan done in
like 20 minutes so let's call that 20 30
minutes my onboarding call is another 30
minutes the offboarding call is 30
minutes so like that's an hour and a
half right there and then the text
message support really varies based on
the age of the child and the child care
situation so if it's a four-month-old
baby and mom is home on maternity leave
and the baby's taking four naps a day I
might hear from that Mom four times a
day which is a lot of text message
support alternatively if I'm working
with a baby that's in daycare I never
hear from Mom during the day because the
baby's napping outside of the home and I
actually work with a lot of older kids
three four five year olds who are in
school a full day they don't nap or if
they do nap it's Happ in at school I

[11:00]
they do nap it's Happ in at school I
prefer to work with kids who are a
little bit older and in school so that
there's not as much need for Real Time
text message support but what I will say
is like the $750 that I charge it's most
often not an incredible amount of time
that I'm putting into it it's the value
is in the the the transformation that
I'm offering to this family I assume
you're a lot more efficient with your
time and your customers today than you
used to be how many customers could you
or someone like you juggle at any given
time if you were only doing the the
coaching responsibly right so when I was
at like the peak of just supporting
families before I started training
others I was actually supporting
25ish families per month so onboarding a
new family almost every single day I
think that that's a lot I don't think
most people could handle that volume
where I am right now which is more like
10 to 12 or 15 families a month is

[12:01]
10 to 12 or 15 families a month is
really comfortable and that feels great
for me I think it really depends on the
person's lifestyle a lot of people who
do this work have other full-time jobs
some of them stay home with their kids
but they're homeschooling so they're
busy so everybody has busy lives and I
would say most people start this line of
work as a side hustle and some of them
scale it to be a full-time business in
time do you measure this to like by a
success at all or is it 100% like I'm
I'm totally I I have four kids right
like we struggled with sleep we never
used a sleep consultant it would have
been really nice I also have an eight
and a 12y old what is your success rate
like is there ever a time when the
parent just fails or are they failing
because they're not following your steps
or sometimes are kids just not fixable
yeah so I make the analogy it's very
similar to the work of a nutritionist or
a physical trainer at the gym right you
can sign on to work with a trainer and

[13:00]
can sign on to work with a trainer and
work out with them once or twice a week
but if you don't go to the gym on the
other days of the week and you're eating
pizza and ice cream all day long you're
not going to same get the same results
as if you're fully committed to the
process right and sleep Consulting is
very similar so I am only successful if
my clients are committed to the process
charging my clients a higher rate
actually helps me with being successful
because the more they invest in the
process financially I think that that
sort of holds them accountable they
don't want to waste the money that
they've spent with me so as I inch my
pricing up year after year I find that
it's actually easier to hold my clients
accountable to make sure that we reach
their goals but I would say that most of
my clients are really successful I mean
nobody bats a thousand we definitely
have situations where families I have a
family who hired me they paid me several
weeks ago and they never scheduled the

[14:00]
weeks ago and they never scheduled the
onboarding call because they probably
read the Sleep plan and they feel
overwhelmed with making the changes that
I proposed they're not ready to do it
that happens you know so you know I'll
follow up with them eventually but if
they're not ready to schedule that first
call they're not ready to do the work so
I don't want to pressure them to get
started before they're ready I'd rather
them wait and and come to me when
they're fully ready to make a change
okay so if if they do what you say like
there really shouldn't be a reason that
the child doesn't at least for like a
newborn start sleeping well so for
newborns like newborns don't really
sleep so beautifully but right we're
we're talking like once babies get to
like three four five months old yeah
they should be sleeping there are a few
situations that could come up like from
a medical perspective that would make it
more challenging for infant toddlers
preschoolers to sleep through the night
but most of what I come up against is
purely behavioral so you know parents

[15:01]
purely behavioral so you know parents
are rocking their babies to sleep
they're feeding their babies to sleep I
work with a lot of older kids so like
three-year-olds have their mom or dad
laying in bed with them while they fall
asleep and then they sneak out of the
room and then the kids wake up in the
middle of the night they're like where's
my mom right so it's a most of it is
behavioral and if it is behavioral we
can get it fixed if there's something
bigger going on then usually that
becomes more apparent once we've put all
of the behavior modifications into place
and if things are still really hard then
I like to kick it back to the
pediatrician and dig a Little Deeper to
see what's going on okay if you were to
distill like the 8020 of helping your
child sleep into one sentence like the
most important critical thing they could
do what would that be falling asleep
independently it's really that simple
like when kids can fall asleep without
support or accommodations then they're
better positioned to fall back asleep
when they Rouse overnight because all
humans wake throughout the night we're

[16:02]
humans wake throughout the night we're
not teaching babies not to wake up
that's not what's going on we are
teaching babies that when they wake up
they don't need to scream and cry and
yell for help they can just you know
roll around get themselves comfy cozy
into a new position and get themselves
back to sleep so does cry it out kind of
go in line with that then yeah so I
don't love the term cry it out I think
it makes parents feel really bad about
themselves and it has a really negative
connotation parents will often ask me
are we going to have to cry it out and
the way that I answer that question is
that most babies and kids who are
learning a new skill cry when they're
learning something new right like I
taught my eight-year-old how to ride a
bike last summer and there were
definitely tears during that process and
when I taught my kids how to use the
potty for the first time they both cried
about it all right if you are watching
this clip right now you are watching
this on YouTube and if you are aan of
podcast please check out my podcast

[17:00]
podcast please check out my podcast
while you're at it because sometimes I
have podcasts that aren't on YouTube and
sometimes I have YouTubes that aren't on
podcast so check out the ker office on
any podcast platform or you can go to
TKO pod.com also my newsletter will
throw that in there there are no ads
It's weekly it's different content than
my podcast and YouTube newsletter.
chrisj cerner.com You'll see the link
and we'll see you there so learning to
fall asleep independently always
involves tears we're not letting babies
cry or leaving babies to cry they just
are crying while trying to fall asleep
in a new way and what I do as a sleep
consultant is I help parents to
understand the difference between their
baby's cries because there's that like
panicked freakout cry when something's
totally new and overwhelming but then
there's also what I like to call the
trying cry where the baby is just
actually not looking for a parent not
looking for help just like trying to get
themselves to sleep and being vocal
about it and so you know not all crying
is created equal and I want parents to
understand how to hear their babies and

[18:02]
understand how to hear their babies and
how to understand that communication so
that they can provide support when
needed but then sit on their hands when
we need to give our kids a little bit of
space yeah I like that because I'm sure
you hear all the time parents are just
like they just throw their hands up and
like yeah my kids just don't sleep and
you're like H they could they could yeah
yeah so I hear a lot of parents use the
word like can't or won't I just had a
call earlier today with aom and Dad of a
three and a half-year-old and they were
using that language they were saying you
know Dylan can't fall asleep unless we
are X Y and Z right and and that's just
not true Dylan can fall asleep without
dad rubbing his back he just doesn't
want to right and so when we give
opportunity it feels amazing yeah right
and and you know as long as it's working
like I always say like if what you're
doing is working if you're rubbing your
back your kids back while they're
falling asleep and that helps them and

[19:00]
falling asleep and that helps them and
then they sleep through the night no
problem back rubs are great but if
you're rubbing your kids back while they
fall asleep and then they're up an hour
and a half later expecting you to rub
their back again then it's a problem
right so our kids are capable of
learning to fall asleep in new ways and
they're definitely going to express
their opinion about the change that's to
be expected and we need to show up
confident and sturdy for them and show
them that they're capable of doing
something that feels a little hard and
challenging they can do it just like
they can learn to zipper their coat just
like they can learn to ride a scooter
this is no different how much of your
job would you say is like tactical stuff
like this Nuts and Bolts versus just
holding your customers accountable to
actually doing what you say I think that
my clients really benefit from the
mindset shifts that I present for them
you know what I shared with you about
cry it out versus like giving your baby
an opportunity to try I think that
that's huge for parents I also think

[20:02]
that's huge for parents I also think
that parents are really overwhelmed with
all of the information that exists on
the internet you know if you go and
Google how to sleep train a six-month
old baby you're going to get 10,000
different answers about how to do that
and if you ask your pediatrician they're
just going to say cry it out right and
so what I think parents are looking for
is they're looking for an expert that
can help them to stift through all of
the noise and all of the opinions you
know moms have their sister-in-law in
one ear they have their mother-in-law in
the other ear they have the daycare
provider telling them something else the
pediatrician telling them something and
sometimes it's just helpful to have one
person that you're going to listen to
take their advice follow their
instructions and get it done and and
that's what I would say I do for my
clients yeah I like that so it's like
it's neither nuts or bolts it's neither
accountability it's like getting them to
approach it differently is like the best

[21:02]
approach it differently is like the best
value that you're providing I think so I
think so I mean it's different for
everybody like some people come to me
and they're really anxious about the
crying and so they need emotional
support and accountability other people
are not at all worried about the crying
they just want to make sure they're
doing it correctly you know everybody
has a different reason for seeking out
support and I try to meet families where
they are and Coach them through methods
and techniques that most closely align
with their parenting style and that feel
safe and comfortable for them because I
want to optimize the process and just
make it go smoothly so that they can
have positive outcome and share my name
with all of their friends yeah yeah like
our oldest was one of those outliers
where he would just cry through the
night and we we didn't know how to fix
it and then we learned like oh he's
allergic to milk so my wife was
breastfeeding him she couldn't drink any
dairy have any dairy products and once
she switched that he slept through the
night and then our last our next three
kids she just didn't have any dairy

[22:00]
kids she just didn't have any dairy
products while she breastfed them and
they slept great you know yeah it's
funny you mention that my my own
daughter had a dairy allergy as well as
an infant and that was I think part of
the reason for why she was so miserable
and it took us months to figure it out
as well my daughter was formula fed but
really she didn't get better until we
got her on this hypoallergenic formula
and what I will say is that Sleep
Consultants especially Sleep Consultants
with some level of experience we can we
can can sort of flag these things a lot
of the time before parents can because
parents will just say like oh she cries
all the time she's so fussy and you know
I'll say can you send me a video of the
crying I want to see the baby's body
language I want to see what they're
doing are they arching their back are
they pulling away from the breast or the
nipple and all of that Intel is really
helpful to me and I can diagnose it from
afar more often than not I've diagnosed
any an ear infection without even being

[23:01]
any an ear infection without even being
there you know I can call it before the
baby even has a fever I can tell the
parents if the child has an ear
infection yeah it's like before two
months probably cic after two months
probably an ear infection there's like
four things it's like 80% of the time
it's one of those four things how are
you finding customers on both of your
businesses today yeah so for my sleep
Consulting business I would say that
most of my business comes to me by way
of referral from past clients so the
family that I spoke to today that has
that little three and a half year-old
little boy I helped his preschool friend
a few months ago and you know the mom
had a great experience we totally
resolved her child sleep challenges and
now she shared my name with a friend of
her kids who's in the same preschool
class I would say that that's most of my
business right now is just Word of Mouth
happy clients sharing in my name with
their friends everybody has a friend who

[24:00]
their friends everybody has a friend who
has a kid who doesn't sleep so you know
when I help one family they know 25
other families that are in a similar
predicament and my name gets spread
around so do you ask for referrals I
should probably be better about it but
yeah at at the end of like when I do a
wrap up phone call I often will end the
call by telling people that my favorite
thing to do is to work myself out of a
job and I should hope that I never need
to hear from them again that being said
if they need me email me they know where
to find me but if they never need me
again the best thing they can do for me
is share my name with a friend I do I do
try to wrap up my my phone calls that
way when we're tying up loose ends at
the end of a contract but I think people
are more than happy to share my name
without me even asking just because they
have such a transformative experience
yeah a lot of the families that I work
with they go weeks or months and
sometimes years without a night of sleep
and usually in 14 days or less I can get

[25:02]
and usually in 14 days or less I can get
it resolved for them so it's it's
life-changing I don't need to ask for
the referral they're they're more than
happy to share and then as far as my as
far as my my online course to train
people to become Sleep Consultants
that's a little bit more complicated
it's a combination of good search engine
optimization
Instagram actually I'm I'm not really on
Instagram so much I don't like to use
social media
I'm more of a people person so I like to
connect with people in real life I
prefer Facebook for social media because
I feel like you can actually make a
connection with another person in a
Facebook group so you know I'll be in a
Facebook group with a bunch of moms who
are looking for a side hustle and I'll
just tell them about what I do and they
want more information I'll hop on a
phone or Zoom call with them and share a
little bit about what what I do I have
my own Facebook group called becoming a
sleep consultant so anybody who's
interested in getting into the field

[26:01]
interested in getting into the field
they can join my Facebook group learn
more there a few years ago I launched a
podcast with the same name so people can
listen to my podcast and hear the
stories of other people who have gone
through my course and started successful
sleep Consulting businesses and my hope
is that they'll listen to those stories
connect with them identify with them and
then start to feel like they could do it
too yeah thank you it's it's so
interesting the referral side of it
because I always counsel people like ask
referrals because people they want to
but they don't think to and you're
reminding them but like you said like
this is a life-changing event right like
they're going to talk about it naturally
and you happen to be the person that
helped enable that so what a what a cool
framework to build businesses around
that where it's like you're selling a
painkiller and not a vitamin people talk
about it yeah that's an interesting way
of putting it absolutely are there any
men in this field a few not many give me
there are give me a percentage
like like no there's like no percentage

[27:01]
like like no there's like no percentage
there's like you
know there there's no percentage there
are a few you know I have I think
860 people enrolled in my sleep
consultant certification course I
probably have six men enrolled in the
program those six men are not
necessarily all working as Sleep
Consultants the way that I do a couple
of them I think are sleep techs so they
deal with sleep apnea and they just came
to me for continuing education and just
wanted to learn the behavioral side of
sleep I have two dads who are doing this
work one alongside his wife it's a
husband and wife Duo and they work
together he's more techsavvy she's more
client facing but they're in business
together and then I have another who's a
stay-at-home dad and just you know he
was good Mr Mom and he's an amazing dad
and he wanted he actually hired a sleep
consultant had a really amazing
experience being coached through the

[28:00]
experience being coached through the
process of resolving sleep in his own
home and now he wants to help other
parents how well is like your best
student doing how big is their business
yeah so I have somebody the last time I
spoke to her which was admittedly a long
time ago like it could have been a year
since we've checked in she was doing
$40,000 a month with Coach I know right
$40,000 a month one to one coaching and
then also online courses sales she has a
course that she offers that's totally
passive and people can enroll in her
program and sort of DIY the process and
I have somebody else who is doing 15 to
$20,000 a month she has two or three
Sleep Consultants working under her sort
of as independent contractors so she's
running a pretty successful business I
have it really runs the gamut like
everybody's vision for Success looks
different I have people who are earning
15 to 20,000 a month I also have people

[29:00]
15 to 20,000 a month I also have people
who are earning1 to $2,000 a month and
that's lifechanging yeah it's
lifechanging I mean the person who I'm
thinking of she's a homeschooling mom
she has two kids of her own she's about
to foster two more kids and she her
first priority is to be a present mother
and she's earning you know $1,500 $2,000
a month and that is totally
transformative for her household so you
know success is Rel
and people's goals are varying and you
know it's not all about the money some
people really this is very heart-
centered work people do this work
because they love it they want to
support families they care for moms and
you know like I would I did this work
for free for a really long time like I
literally would do it for free it's
amazing that I get paid to do it but I
would do it whether I was getting paid
or not that's incredible are there any
like Nationwide franchises doing this or
do do you see an opportunity there if
not there aren't any Nationwide

[30:02]
not there aren't any Nationwide
franchises that I know of there are some
larger companies I don't know if you're
familiar with Huckleberry for example
which is an app it's an app that
basically helps parents to understand
when to put their baby down for the next
nap I shouldn't even speak to this
because I'm not entirely sure if it's AI
based or if it's just data driven what
that looks like but they have in-house
Sleep Consultants so you can like pay to
upgrade on the app and actual actually
work with a coach so there are
situations like that where you can work
for a bigger company as a sleep
consultant but I don't know that there
are any Nationwide franchises most of
the people who work in this field are
doing so part-time you know they have
other things going on in their lives I
mean I'm thinking of other franchises
like there's a franchise that it's
Nationwide it's in all 50 states and
it's like it's like Consulting but you
help business owners save money on like
there's like six pillars there there's

[31:00]
there's like six pillars there there's
payroll credit card processing office
supplies and they charge by taking a
percentage of everything they sa their
business owner clients so there there's
precedent for there being a franchise
for like a Consulting type service right
like I I bet you anything with you know
within the next five or 10 years there
will be someone doing this Nationwide on
like a very systematized franchise scale
taking eight to 10% of the revenue from
everyone that they train yeah so I will
say there are okay so there are training
programs that you go through okay when
you said a franchise I was sort of
thinking of it differently but like
there are a few training programs that
train you and then put you to work and
take a percentage of your intake right
that that is happening I will say I
don't think that model is super
successful because really what sells
this business is our personalities like
people come to me because they know me

[32:00]
people come to me because they know me
they've heard that I'm the best they've
heard X Y and Z when you try to just
sell it with like a brand name I don't
think it has the same effect because
it's really such a personal service and
a personal relationship that fuels
growth in this business that I don't
think those companies are I don't think
they're rocking enrolling let's just say
that okay all right Jane well thank you
this is great I learned a lot I'm sure
everyone else will as well
thank you so much all right thanks all
right what you think please share it
with a friend and we'll see you next
time on the ker office
