would you look at this freaking thing
right here so I've got a friend in
Alabama that sells underground storm
shelters and his business makes about 42
million bucks a year but I think this
business idea is even better day 26 of
Genius business ideas so follow from
more but you don't have to pick one or
the other you can still find a storm
shelter manufacturer and resell their
stuff and have a business on your hand
you can also sell these things and these
can be storm Sellers as well it all
comes down to packaging and framing are
there more potential customers out there
that want a tornado shelter or that want
an underground fridge underground
fridges are stupid why would you need
one because people want to be unique
they want something to show off some
people want to save the environment some
people want to double up they want a
fridge and a tornado shelter you don't
have to manufacture look how many views
this video has your demand full business
plan right here
