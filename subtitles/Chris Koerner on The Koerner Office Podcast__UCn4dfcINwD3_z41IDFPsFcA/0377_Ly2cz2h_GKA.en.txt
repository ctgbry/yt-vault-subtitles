look at this freaking thing right here
it's a robot lmow they've been around
for a few years but they're not yet
being monetized until now here's what
the future of landscaping businesses
will look like if I were you I'd go buy
a landscaping business right now for one
to three times annual profits that way
you can start with a wellestablished
customer list then I'd buy three to five
of robot lawnmowers similar to this
behind me and I'd go find a few beta
customers to opt into this new pilot
program and here's what it would look
like show up drop off your robot
lawnmowers train them to the yard drive
to the next house drop off your robot
lawnmowers train them to the yard repeat
over and over again go back pick them up
put them back on the trailer charge them
as you drive you can have one operator
running a whole route of robot
lawnmowers 80% less payroll less
maintenance less hassle this is a
perfect example of how AI are going to
make humans more productive than we've
ever seen
