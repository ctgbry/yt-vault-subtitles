look at this freaking thing right here
okay this is a cool idea which also
means it's a cool business idea but not
in the way that you're seeing right here
above me day 16 of showing you 202's
best business ideas follow for more so I
had this friend named TJ he came up with
a genius pool idea and this was years
ago but it's never been launched and
it's quite simple you build and sell
coral reef type stuff to Pool owners and
you can distribute it through pool
stores through social media or on a
Shopify site imagine like a sponge that
was in the shape of coral reef that was
weighted down and sat in the bottom of
the pool and kids could dive in there
and swim around it and feel like like
they're in the ocean that's not a thing
that's not a product what you're seeing
here is very industrial very expensive
not for the average consumer you go
start this and I bet it works go right
