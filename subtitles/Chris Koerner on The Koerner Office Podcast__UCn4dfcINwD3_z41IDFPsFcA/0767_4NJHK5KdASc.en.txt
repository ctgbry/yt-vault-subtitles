I was borrowing my buddy's truck. On the
weekends, I coordinated everything for
Saturdays. I was out and about
delivering shelves. May of 24, it got so
busy, I quit the day job and did this
full-time instead of just my evenings
[music] to this. If you think of a
$1,000 shelf, the expenses on that is
probably 150 bucks. So, there's still
[music] plenty of profit. My record is
still 100% for in-person sales. Hey, can
you come measure for me? Sure. I always
close. It doesn't cost you a thing to
make a listing, so make as many as you
can.
&gt;&gt; Use Chad GPT to come up with ideas.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you can sell anything.
&gt;&gt; What advice do you have for people
wanting to sell anything on Facebook
Marketplace?
Way back in August of 2024, I
interviewed Alex Nelson. He is my buddy
in Utah, aka the shelf dude, and we
talked all about how he's able to make
15 grand a month in net profit selling
custom garage shelves exclusively on
Facebook Marketplace. That was episode
55 and it's linked in the description
below. So, I wanted to have him back on

[01:00]
below. So, I wanted to have him back on
the podcast for an update. How are
things going? How has your business
changed if at all? What advice would you
give to other people trying to sell
anything on Facebook Marketplace, either
a product or a service? So, if you want
the full context, you're welcome to
listen to the episode link below from
August 21st, 2024. But we summarize that
whole episode in the first 5 or 10
minutes of this episode. So, please
enjoy my episode with Alex. So, tell us
what you do, Alex. We'll get everyone up
to speed.
&gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Well, I am the shelf dude. You
can see that here on the shirt. I make
the shelving units for those black and
yellow totes you can get at any of the
big box stores. You probably have some
in your garage, but they're all stacked.
But that's not the best way, most
efficient way to access them or store
them because you send the husband out.
Hey, go get me this. And he goes out and
has to unstack everything, find it. It's
a stressful situation for him. I don't
want to do this. takes them a long time
compared to, hey, just go pull the one
out directly from the shelf. So, that's
what I do. It's really worked out for

[02:01]
what I do. It's really worked out for
me. It's kind of a It's a real simple
solution to a everyday need. Everyone
has this.
&gt;&gt; And where did you first see the design
for the shelves that you make? And for
those watching on YouTube, we'll overlay
what it looks like.
&gt;&gt; Sure. So, back in November of 2023, so
two years now, my wife was just kind of
scrolling around, saw something similar
on online, just kind of a thing in the
background. And hey, you should make one
of those for our garage. So, okay, made
one because I also felt that stress,
that disorganization, everything was
stacked. And so, I made one, changed our
garage. I I immediately felt a relief.
It's like, oh, this is easy now. I don't
have to unstack anything. You know, it's
it's it's funny how many how many people
I've run into that have pulled their
back or pulled their their arm because
they've toppled over or they can't lift
it.
&gt;&gt; Do you remember where online you saw it?

[03:00]
&gt;&gt; Do you remember where online you saw it?
&gt;&gt; I want to say it was a it was a
Instagram. This for my wife. She she
forwarded it to me and she was looking
for a entertainment center.
&gt;&gt; Okay. one of the ones that you can buy
the plants to and buy or build it
yourself. And she'd seen something
similar on that guy's site. Was there
any indication on his site that it was a
popular design or a popular item or no?
&gt;&gt; Not that I can recall. It was just kind
of just something there.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. This is kind of like when I tell
my Bucky story, the first question that
people ask is what else could you do
that with? You know, like what other
stores could you do that with? And I
don't know, you know, Trader Joe's, HB,
I we've kind of dabbled with some of
them. Sometimes you just hit lightning
in a bottle and it can't be replicated.
Oftentimes, in fact, usually in my
experience, it can be replicated with a
different product or service. I wonder
if there's a way to like go find go to
Pinterest or Etsy or a site that sells

[04:00]
Pinterest or Etsy or a site that sells
plans like this and like look at the
number of comments or sort by most
popular and take your exact same
playbook with it could be a coffee
table, could be a table, could be garage
shelving that look looks completely
different and and to use Facebook
Marketplace as your distribution
platform to copy that. Just wondering
out loud if that could be a thing. I
think that there's there's so many ideas
out there. It's like, oh, just just sell
that. I don't know how. Get some
pictures, put on Facebook, and see what
happens. It's just that easy.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; If people buy it up or you get a lot of
interest, well, that's kind of you're
proving your concept right there.
&gt;&gt; So, remind me again how it all worked
out. So, you built one for your wife.
What was the triggering event that said,
"I'm going to try to sell this."
&gt;&gt; Oh, great question. So, at this point in
our lives, I was wanting to go back to
school, get the MBA, and actually
finishing that up in two weeks. We need
money to to pay for this NBA program.
And that was the actual motivation to
sell these once in the in the mix in the

[05:02]
sell these once in the in the mix in the
in the weeds. It's like, oh, this is
this could be this has some potential.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And to remind everyone, you know,
May of 24, it got so busy, I quit the
day job and did this full-time,
dedicating eight hours a day instead of
just my evenings to this. But yeah, I
was I was borrowing my buddy's truck on
the weekends. I coordinated everything
for Saturdays. Didn't see my wife or
kids for many Saturdays as I was out and
about delivering shelves.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it would go a really long way if
you just subscribe to this channel. It's
just a good way of saying, "Chris,
thanks for the value."
&gt;&gt; And all of your leads were coming from
either Facebook Marketplace or from
referrals from Facebook Marketplace,
right?
&gt;&gt; Correct. Yep. It was all that was me
when I wasn't working or building
shelves. It's I was on Messenger. Yes.
Yes. Is this still available? Yes, it
is.
&gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Are you still interested? Yes.
Are you still interested? Yes. Are you
still over and over?
&gt;&gt; Follow up as best I could with all this.

[06:00]
&gt;&gt; Follow up as best I could with all this.
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Did you then or do you now boost your
posts or are you just relying on organic
traffic to those posts?
&gt;&gt; I only experimented with boosting. I
didn't really see much success with that
just because it makes it louder. I I I
see it as this. It makes it louder to
your already friend group,
&gt;&gt; not external people.
&gt;&gt; I don't know if that's was the algorith,
&gt;&gt; but it just it makes it louder to your
own friends. But when you make an ad,
you get outside of your particular
realm.
&gt;&gt; If I were you, I would try that again
because when I filmed the follow-up to
the appliance rental video a couple
months ago, Kyler came out here to
Dallas. We posted appliances for rent on
Facebook Marketplace just as we always
do. He got a couple inquiries and then
we put like 20 bucks behind it. Now, the
lifetime value of these customers is
like 1,500. So, 20 bucks is nothing. We
put 20 bucks behind it and we got like
30 inquiries. Now, this is a big this is
a big market, but the more competitive a

[07:00]
a big market, but the more competitive a
market, like the more competing listings
there are, the more you're boosting uh
can make a difference. It can put you at
the top of the search results, right?
So, I know you have a lot more
competitors today than you used to,
which makes me think think that boosting
could be a lot more effective today than
it used to be. And you were saying
before we hit record that
&gt;&gt; you're getting undercut on price.
Boosting also enables you to keep a
higher price because more eyeballs equal
higher price.
&gt;&gt; Good point. I think it's uh time to
revisit that particular strategy.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. So, you started posting to
Facebook. Was your secret sauce on the
posting the pictures or the videos?
&gt;&gt; H
&gt;&gt; or neither?
&gt;&gt; I I believe it was it was pictures. I
didn't do a whole bunch of video at the
beginning.
&gt;&gt; Interesting. I assumed you would be
since you're so active on Instagram
reels, but
&gt;&gt; Right. Right. But near the beginning, I
wasn't as photogenic or practiced, I
guess you could say.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, it was just pictures kind of they
spoke for themselves, right? Totes
stacked up. Having a kind of a side by

[08:01]
stacked up. Having a kind of a side by
side before and after garage is
unorganized to a clean shelf. I think
that that spoke wonders.
&gt;&gt; What were you charging back then for
these units on average? I know they have
custom ones. And then are you charging
about the same today? Yeah, in our first
video I was charging $40 per per tote
per space and it's the same today.
&gt;&gt; Really good.
&gt;&gt; And so obviously there's some the with
every season there's es and flows with
that. Uh I always recommend that you
different listings have different prices
on them. Uh whether it's a different
size shelf, which is obviously going to
be a different price than a small one,
big one, but I vary it also. Maybe I
drop it down to 32.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Monster tote per space.
&gt;&gt; If I'm feeling frisky, 25, [laughter]
and just to kind of see the difference
in the different listings, I get people
for both, right? I I even get calls
saying,

[09:00]
saying,
&gt;&gt; you know, calls over the phone. I'm
telling them the price and they say,
"Oh, I I would have thought it'd be be
more." Well, I can charge you more if
you want.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. No, [laughter]
but it really depends in the eye of the
the beholder, the customer, what value
they put on this type of shelf.
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; there's obviously some that could care
less. I don't care. I can unstack them.
I'm young. Whatever it is, I'm not doing
it. My husband is. Okay.
&gt;&gt; But there's also those who understand,
feel this this need that I have to
organize it that understand exactly what
the value is and are willing to pay for
it.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So a 4x5 would be 20 totes and
that's like 800 bucks give or take.
&gt;&gt; Just to do the math here, 20 times 40 is
800 bucks.
&gt;&gt; Okay. And does that include the totes or
they have to buy those separate?
&gt;&gt; That would be separate.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So just the wood and the wheels
and just the structure.
&gt;&gt; Just the structure.
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Now I remember when we last spoke,
we were talking about ideas that were

[10:00]
we were talking about ideas that were
tangential to this, like you could do
garage organization services or garage
cleanup services. I've since seen like
videos on Instagram of people that have
that business, not related to shelving
at all, but just like a a standalone
garage cleaning business or garage
organization business. Have you dabbled
in that at all?
&gt;&gt; A friend of mine, we kind of called each
other at the same time and said, "Hey,
let's do this. Hey, I was going to call
you about this." Haven't rolled that out
yet, but how that would be set up is,
you know, just to kind of utilize the
the shelf due platform. Hey, I can
organize the space as well if you need.
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; in addition to a shelf. If you want the
shelf, great. I can come and organize
for you and kind of work in tandem with
my buddy and doing that side of the
business. That would obviously
necessitate more than just me. That
would require some employees, more man-h
hours to do that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Because every job is going to vary a lot
more than on my particular model, you

[11:00]
more than on my particular model, you
know. Stay tuned. There might be an
update on the on the website for that.
&gt;&gt; Do you have like a database of all the
customers you've ever had?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, all the purchases of plans,
all the physical install of shelves,
those customers, I got a list of all
them, everyone who's ever emailed me,
you know, I think it's all it's all been
listed. Now, let's say theoretically
you've delivered 300 shelves lifetime,
&gt;&gt; probably closer to a thousand.
&gt;&gt; Okay, let's say a thousand, even better.
and you get 10% of them to sign up for
like annual spring cleaning services,
right? 600 bucks, right? That could be
600 times 100 60,000. That could be 60
grand a year in recurring revenue where
you really have no cost. It's just your
labor, your time. Of course, your cost
would be any help that you had, but that
could be an entirely other business. And
then if you were to go to all your
competitors, build a database of all the
people on Facebook Marketplace in your
area that are doing the same thing and
just say, "Hey, I do garage cleanup as
well. Every lead you send me, I'll give
you a hundred bucks." And you could have

[12:01]
you a hundred bucks." And you could have
like this network of referral partners.
Cuz the chance of them hearing that and
thinking, "I'm going to do that myself."
It's probably pretty low. Like it's not
it's not a sexy thing to do is go clean
out someone's garage on a Saturday.
Right.
&gt;&gt; Right. Who who likes to do that,
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; right? But like eventually, you know, do
things that don't scale. You could just
you could hire it all out and you could
monetize your competitors, you know, in
a different way,
&gt;&gt; right? Yeah. As they as they undercut
you in one way, you know, not take
advantage but, you know, create a
business.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Monetize them. So, you got
to 15K a month in revenue. You ended up
getting a a shop, right?
&gt;&gt; Correct. Yep. Got a shop. Uh, I had one,
had to move out of it. Got another one
now. It's a little bit nicer. That's the
one you most recently have seen. It
really works out to have a space where
you can lay out everything, all your
tools in one spot, move from station to
station and not have to rearrange things
as I did in the garage way back when. I

[13:02]
as I did in the garage way back when. I
got to move this. Okay, tuck it away.
Got to get the cars in. It's no longer
an issue. I can just show up, turn the
lights on, and start cutting.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And today your business is more
about like working with a network of
installers and you have a course that
you sell as well and less about building
shelves directly, right?
&gt;&gt; Sure. No. Yeah, I still have shelves on
my docket uh for things to build, but
it's changed. It's it's kind of
transformed as I've kind of built up
this this following of like-minded
people wanting to organize spaces,
installers, as as you just mentioned,
that can kind of just join my my network
of installers to be able to receive
leads when they come in as people
message me, hey, I'm in I'm in Oshkosh
or I'm in Florida, I'm in I'm in
Australia, right? I can forward those
leads on through this installer network,
which kind of works out great.
&gt;&gt; Listen, Beehive has always been the best
newsletter platform for monetization.

[14:01]
newsletter platform for monetization.
Their ad network and their analytics are
unmatched. But they just had their
biggest update ever, and it's something
that all digital creators have to hear
about. It's not just newsletters
anymore. They just dropped their own AI
website builder, dynamic podcast website
feature, native analytics, direct
digital product sales, and a link in bio
capability. And let me tell you, the
podcast website feature is outrageous. I
can pull my entire podcast directly into
my Beehive site, and it automatically
creates episode pages with show notes,
an audio player, and embedded YouTube
videos. This replaces Pod Page and I've
already started messing around with
their digital products. Now you can sell
ebooks, courses, templates, whatever you
want directly to the people who are
already reading your stuff. So stop
paying for five different tools to do
all of this stuff that Beehive offers
within one platform. I've been using
Beehive for 2 years at this point, but
it's about time you got started. So
switch over at beehive.com/chris

[15:01]
switch over at beehive.com/chris
and use the code chris30 to get 30% off
your first three months. That's
beehiv.com/chris.
What do you sell those leads for? How
much do you get for referring someone
&gt;&gt; base? There's kind of a 7030 split. If
you think of a $1,000 shelf, that's
obviously 300. 700 of their 700 for that
size of shelves, roughly a 5x5. The
expenses on that, it's probably 150
bucks.
&gt;&gt; Oh, wow. It's great.
&gt;&gt; And they're 70%.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So even if they're they're they're
making 700 bucks on that, they're still
80% profit margin and which is their
time, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Aside their time and that's
that's up to them however fast they want
to build it. So
&gt;&gt; now, have you dabbled with making other
stuff for people?
&gt;&gt; Well, yeah. I often don't post those
because I don't want to build more of
them.
&gt;&gt; The process hasn't been streamlined
enough.
&gt;&gt; But no, uh most recently, I don't know
if my wife posted this one, but I made a

[16:00]
if my wife posted this one, but I made a
bed for my daughter. Mhm. And
&gt;&gt; so it's kind of the same old setup with
the totes, but just in a different
arrangement, bed style.
&gt;&gt; And so you can tuck your totes
underneath it, bed on top. It's kind of
just a different way of instead of slide
them underneath the bed, you can put
them on the shelves.
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's cool. You don't want to scale
that.
&gt;&gt; I think could work. That could blow up.
&gt;&gt; Have you tried to sell that yet? Like on
Facebook?
&gt;&gt; No, she my my I believe my wife as she's
yelling at me over here whispering. I'm
still working on the video
&gt;&gt; to be released. And also another
innovation just over time is just better
plans. I made the first plans that you
could buy online just kind of digital
download on my computer myself PDF Adobe
and they all look different. It's kind
of funny looking. But I've since
upgraded all those once purchased want
to see a different style you can go on
and see those improved version. I got a
guy now that can make plants. So he's
he's out
&gt;&gt; also making plans for that bed as well.

[17:00]
&gt;&gt; also making plans for that bed as well.
What tips do you have for people that
are selling anything on Facebook
Marketplace, a product or a service?
Facebook doesn't really like people
selling services, right? How do you get
around that? To your first question of
advice that I would give to somebody who
wanted to sell something on Facebook, it
it comes down to wanting it and your
why. Why are you wanting to sell
something? Obviously, it's for money.
You you want to provide in some way for
your family. I think having that at the
at the core of why you're doing it, it's
in it's in the why is going to help you
push forward those difficult times of it
not working. That's first and paramount.
From there, it's it's a lot of trial and
error. I believe if they you know, if
they want to sell aripas or or little uh
you know, those are the Venezuelan
treats or empanadas or whatever. I'm
thinking of lat Latin food for some
reason, but any little trinket or hobby
or or craft or whatever it is, they just

[18:02]
or or craft or whatever it is, they just
got to put it out there and see what
happens. Makes take some nice photos,
make a make an example of it, take a
photo, post it out there, and see what
happens. If you get a lot of feedback
saying, "Oh, this is too expensive." Or,
"Hey, do you have this version?" Well,
all those little details go into making
a better version. Many people don't even
reach this point. They are they're
scared of what's going to happen. That's
the most sad thing that I've seen. It's
like, oh, they're struggling for money,
but they don't know what to do. Well,
just try. You got to try.
&gt;&gt; Instead, they resort to other free
services in the community to support
themselves, which nothing's wrong with
that. Maybe that, you know, but there's
a lot to be said and a lot to be had
with just trying something trying
something new.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I love I mean, I'm doing this
right now. I'm going to share my screen.
I just pulled up Facebook Marketplace. I
love just pulling up Facebook
Marketplace and seeing what Facebook's
trying to show me on the homepage
because it's
&gt;&gt; it's always the most unique things.

[19:00]
&gt;&gt; it's always the most unique things.
Like, here we go. We got a free home
gym. Okay. Well, you could sell that
stuff. Go get it for free and then sell
it.
&gt;&gt; Free old church pews. I guarantee you
someone would pay for that. Oh,
&gt;&gt; yeah. I didn't even search anything.
This is just what the homepage is
showing me.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. This is the whole buy resell
market is crazy.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; The DI. I don't know if you have a DI in
in Dallas, Texas.
&gt;&gt; No. Do you like thrift stores?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's like a desireette. It's like
the It's a thrift store basically. But
people line up at the at the thrift
stores waiting for new goods, buy it all
up, and then go resell it. You know,
there's a business.
&gt;&gt; But it requires that mindset of somebody
to go in and be looking for that
opportunity and wanting to do that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, this guy's selling a 16ft
trailer with a tiny home on it for 9,500
bucks. Like 9,500 bucks for a house.
Like it's obviously not as nice as like
a formal tiny home, but tiny homes sell
for 80 grand. Like a trailer alone could
be 95 in the woods.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Little cabin.

[20:01]
&gt;&gt; Little cabin.
&gt;&gt; Golf cart for two grand. An 8 foot
floating alligator. Like it's just it's
so interesting to to just ideulate by
looking at these. Sourdough starter. Pay
what you can. You know,
&gt;&gt; there you go.
&gt;&gt; School bus for $4,200. You can sell
anything.
&gt;&gt; Have you come across other people on
Facebook Marketplace like selling
something interesting or unique that's
kind of made you your head?
&gt;&gt; I remember
seeing some flowers, not your regular
flowers, but kind of a crafty take, roll
it, paint it. They look like the metal
aluminum ones that are all kind of
folded up and you put them on your wall,
if you know what I'm talking about.
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; Somebody was selling those for 30 bucks.
people are just making making crafts and
people were buying them. I thought to
myself, well, how what is that what is
the work required behind that? Is it
worth it? How long does it take you to
make that? You're selling it for 30 and
it took you two hours. It's $15 an hour.

[21:00]
it took you two hours. It's $15 an hour.
Walmart pays 17. You either go get a job
or or innovate and try and make them
faster.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, I pulled up Facebook
Marketplace and someone was selling
fetucci alfredo. [laughter] Like that's
it.
&gt;&gt; There's a lot of dumplings. a lot. I'm
so curious. Like, I want to do a whole
video series where I just I buy a bunch
of stuff, have pay them to deliver it to
me, and then I just interview them on
the doorstep. Like, tell me about your
business,
&gt;&gt; right?
&gt;&gt; That'd be so interesting to me. Like, I
don't care if no one watched it. I I
would be fascinated.
&gt;&gt; There's a lot of hustlers out there,
which is cool.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. A lot of entrepreneurs. I think
you there's an article or probably a
video of Utah. There's a lot of
entrepreneurs, MLMs, influencers,
a lot of the these types here, which
create a lot of competition. Brings out
the best in us. So,
&gt;&gt; what advice do you have for people
wanting to sell anything on Facebook
Marketplace? Are there any like best
practices that they should follow?
&gt;&gt; I kind of mentioned this, but it but
it's quantity, right? It doesn't cost
you a thing. If you don't do ads, don't

[22:00]
you a thing. If you don't do ads, don't
boost anything. It doesn't cost you a
thing to make a listing. So, make as
many as you can. Use chat GPT to come up
with ideas.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Whatever it is or even just
yourself change one word. You know that
repetition, that big net that you cast
is going to help you determine which of
those is best. Then you hone in on that
one. Just kind of I don't know if it's
common knowledge, but just hone in on
the one that works and do more of that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You always have to be doing that always.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I'm telling myself this, too. I you
always have to be
&gt;&gt; selling. If you're not selling, the the
business dies.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. What do you think is next for your
business?
&gt;&gt; As we've discussed, the shelf, it's not
a repeat subscription type model.
&gt;&gt; I set somebody up and this shelf's going
to last until the second coming, I want
to say. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; I was going to say that
&gt;&gt; it's it's solid. It's not going
anywhere. And you can move it with you
because it's built with screws, right?
Move it to your next house. So that
doesn't cause a whole bunch of repeat

[23:00]
doesn't cause a whole bunch of repeat
customers. And so I've had to innovate.
And so that's where we've now
transitioned always had we've always had
the digital plans which you can buy. But
now we've kind of transitioned over to
the installer network which you got a
couple different tiers of that. You got
the free version which hey if you're
making shelves, you're doing your own
thing, great. Let's just connect and I
can send you something later on if you
need an extra shelf, right? Who who
wouldn't reject that? And then you got a
paid version which just kind of gets you
more exposure on the website that lots
of people are visiting. Hey, and get
your name listed right there, your
location, territory, exclusivity, etc.
Get your hat and shirt cuz you're a
shelf dude. Now, that's kind of what the
installer shelf dude pro program is what
I'm calling it. Once again, try
innovating is is this course that I've
developed is everything that I've
learned over the last two years, ever
growing as well of eight modules of how
to do this, how to do that, how to do
Facebook, how to, etc. If it's not
there, let me know and I'll I'll add

[24:00]
there, let me know and I'll I'll add
that in. But you can take that if you
haven't if you don't know anything about
shelves, take that, learn everything
that I've learned and have implemented
and and hit the ground running. So
that's that's also there as we've
discussed kind of the the garage
organization is a possibility that I'm
looking at as well as some other digital
assets that I'm currently in the works.
But don't want to, you know, a book for
example. I'm kind of dabbling in a book.
&gt;&gt; Oh, there you go.
&gt;&gt; of why we get so disorganized. Quick
question. What if there were a private
community out there of people that were
building businesses based on this
podcast? Well, I just made it and it's
only for business starters and business
builders. It's called TK Owners and it's
basically like having me and 100 other
business geniuses as your business
partner. Also, there's going to be
exclusive new trends, growth hacks,
business ideas, and a database of
everything I've ever talked about.

studies. You'll have weekly ask me

[25:00]
studies. You'll have weekly ask me
anythings with me while I'll answer your
questions directly. You can join now at
tkowners.com. Link in the show notes.
&gt;&gt; The point there being that Oh, yeah. You
could learn how to avoid it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I think people would like that. It's
kind of like it's like a self-help book,
right? And obviously that's one of the
biggest categories like what was the
Marie Condo show?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; It's like that like there's clearly a
demand for people to pay for that. aside
from these little things that I sell,
right? I I get kind of caught up
sometimes of, oh, and I'm just sick of
selling, just a little tired, want to
do, and I got to I got to remind myself
why why am I doing this? And it comes
back to a real that I or a story that I
shared recently of I love to organize a
space. Maybe that's the OCD in me. I
love to organize it, make it clean and
accessible, but the stress related to
that that the person has because it's
it's disorganized, it's cluttered, is a

[26:01]
it's disorganized, it's cluttered, is a
stress they don't know they have until
they have it released.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, I love bringing that piece. Not any
customer I've installed a shelf for has
said, "I hate this afterwards." They're
always ranting and raving because much
better. Thank you so much.
&gt;&gt; And those are the moments that fill me
up. I was like, "Oh, that's why I'm
doing it."
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; They feel and understand
that this is so much better. Why didn't
I have it any other way? A recent
customer, they're moving located here in
Draper, moving from house, they're doing
some renovations. So, they were staying
with grandma, but all their house 150
bins was in a storage unit. So, they
called me up, "Hey, we need some we we
can't be unstacking all these things all
the time." because they'd see my stuff.
Went over there. I set them up with five
5x5 shelves. That's 25 times. That's 150
totes with wheels. And she was is

[27:00]
totes with wheels. And she was is
ecstatic. I This is the best thing ever.
This was And it was actually his husband
her husband's birthday. Like this is his
birthday present. He loves it. I always
think back when I'm having a rough day.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; That's why I'm doing it.
&gt;&gt; That's awesome. During your sales
process, do you sell the dream of that?
like paint the picture of how they're
going to feel when you're done.
&gt;&gt; A lot of the sales kind of the how that
happens is a lot of just message over
over Facebook. And so, hey, here's the
price. Here's some pictures and
[clears throat] what's your space look
like? Send me pictures and kind of
create that professionalism there and
let them know that I'm the expert. And
there's not a lot of calls where I have
that opportunity to to paint that
picture for them.
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; that's a good point. Maybe I It's It's
hard It's always hard to ask for a phone
number. Hey, what's your phone number?
They don't want to hear,
&gt;&gt; right? People don't.
&gt;&gt; So,
&gt;&gt; it there's a trade-off, though, because
you're going to be more likely to close
them if if they do give you the number,
right?
&gt;&gt; My record is still 100% for inperson.
&gt;&gt; Oh, wow. Your close rate.

[28:01]
&gt;&gt; Oh, wow. Your close rate.
&gt;&gt; My close rate there. Hey, can you come
measure for me? Sure. I always close
them
&gt;&gt; because I'm able to connect with them
that way. I'm in the space.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. My friend Alex that does land
clearing, he he attributes all of his
success to painting the picture in their
mind of what their land's going to look
like and how they're going to feel when
it's done. And I love applying that
principle to any industry. Like tell
them how they're going to feel when it's
done. And he said sometimes when they he
clears some acreage, they'll cry because
they're like, "My property has not
looked like this since I was a kid. It
looks like a different property." And so
like once he saw that reaction in
people, which he didn't expect, now he
like tries to get ahead of that reaction
and tell them that they're going to feel
that way. And his close rate went up
even more.
&gt;&gt; Sure. Sure. And I connect the emotion to
it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, the shelfd.com, that's where
we find you, right?
&gt;&gt; It was a do company site before. Got rid
of that. Now it's just shelfd.com.
