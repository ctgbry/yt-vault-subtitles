right here's exactly how we plan to use
this ugly red Warehouse to print $1.1
million of free money so this warehouse
is at an RV park in shreport Louisiana
that we are buying in a few weeks the
original owner of the RV park built this
building it's 16,000 ft 80 X2 ft he
built it to do boat and RV storage but
then he just stored his crap in there
now that we're buying the park he's
moving his crap offsite and we're going
to go ahead with that plan to do boat
and RV storage we're right in between
two Lakes we're on the main Highway
there's no competitors around and we can
charge $200 per month for a boat or an
RV and this thing fits 50 boats or RVs
so if you're doing the math that's
$10,000 a month or $120,000 a year and
we already have a park manager sitting
in the office so our marginal cost of
adding the service is next to nothing so
$120,000 a year at an 8% cap rate equals
almost $1.5 million of equity added to
this park for no additional money or
work follow me for more RV Park
