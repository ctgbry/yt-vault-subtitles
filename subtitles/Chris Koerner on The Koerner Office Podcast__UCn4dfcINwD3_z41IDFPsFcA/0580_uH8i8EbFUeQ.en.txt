[00:00]
you're literally stupid if you don't
take me up on this there's no risk if
you're going into something and you have
no experience it's a cheat code if you
want to learn how to sell or to Market
things you don't buy any courses from
the gurus and the marketers but reverse
engineer how they're doing it if it's
working it's working for a reason Don't
Be Afraid or Jam to copy Frank Karn is
the OG internet marketer he thinks what
if I start selling pet training manuals
on the internet that's where he made his
first Millions 300,000 for $47 a piece
14 mil give or TI
[Music]
okay let's start off with a question
I've got a fill-in-the blank question
for you Nick all right I'm pretty sure I
know how you're gonna answer this but
we'll
see okay Grant Cardone and Tony Robbins
are world class at Fillin the blank
sales okay okay
marketing absolutely yeah you win you
you got it cuz like one's a motivational
speaker one's a Guru but like the

[01:02]
speaker one's a Guru but like the
overlap is marketing right M would you
believe they both learned their
marketing prowess from the same person
that most people have never heard of
really yes really his name is Frank Kar
have you ever heard that name no no
you're in the business world I'm in the
business world most people have never
heard of Frank Kern but if you're Alex
Bro mosy you love frank Kern he talks
about him every now and then he loves
Frank Kern Frank Kar is the Tai Lopez
before Tai Lopez he was the OG internet
marketer the OG Guru the original Guru
oh oh you're not saying he was an
internet marketer you're saying he was
the original Guru he invented internet
marketing gurus Frank Kern he is the
Godfather of it he's the OGG Original
Gangster
Guru yes can I tell you how we got to
start yes I'm freaking sitting on pins
and needles all right he grew up in a
trailer obviously it's funny grew up in
like a a four squ foot house in Santa

[02:01]
like a a four squ foot house in Santa
Clarita or something but but it was on
trailer Street I grew up in a trailer
okay anyway grew up in a trailer went to
college at Syracuse dropped out early
started selling things door too give me
a year sorry like when is this is this
give me year born in 73 he's born in
1973 born in
1973 started selling door Todo in like
the late 80s early 90s well he's younger
than Grant Cardone and Tony Robbins yes
he is so how did they learn from him he
trained them oh he trained them
specifically on internet marketing yeah
yeah oh got it got it got it okay okay
I'm up to speed I'm a bit of a stupid
idiot now I understand okay so because
Grant Cardone was already doing things
in life Tony Robbins was already I mean
he's been a world famous motivational
speaker for a long time yep they were
doing their thing this guy Frank karna
either C came to them or taught them

[03:00]
either C came to them or taught them
like hey this is the ultimate
distribution channel the internet
selling to the masses one to many yes
yes so let me back up so he starts
selling credit card processing door Todo
which is a very very hard sale and then
he says huh what if I sell credit card
terminals on this new thing called the
internet so he start selling credit card
terminals on the internet for 300 bucks
see some success there some success but
not a lot I don't know how his mind goes
there but he thinks what if I start
selling pet training manuals on the
internet via audio books okay that's
what he did that's where he made his
first Millions I want you to guess how
many pet training manuals this guy sold
over the course of seven years seven
years number of pet training
manuals 100,000$ 300,000 for $47 a piece
JZ Lise what does that come out to $12
million 14 14 mil give or take wow wow

[04:00]
million 14 14 mil give or take wow wow
basically 100% margin it's an audio book
okay yeah it was literally a digital
course it was literally a digital
product digital course yep and what
happens when you start selling digital
products you become Ty Lopez Jr okay Ty
Lopez was Ty Lopez he was addicted yeah
so he starts like he just invents all
these terms that Alex horos talks about
on a daily basis Alex horoi is wh
labeled Frank karna that's not a joke
like
Frank invent the term white label
probably Alex horos took everything
Frank Kar did and like packaged it in uh
like a a social media way that Frank
Kern never really excelled at he's got a
YouTube channel he's got Instagram but
he's not very big on any of them it's
why most people haven't heard of him
Alex horos put it in his books h100
million do offers $100 million dollar
leads and it's all he talks about in his
content and it's basically all built on
Frank Kern I love this because there's
like seven Frameworks I'm already
thinking of

[05:01]
keep going okay all right so Frank karna
he has an eight-step process for selling
anything okay here's a framework before
you get to your Frameworks here's mine
if you want to learn how to sell or to
Market things you don't buy any courses
from the gurus and the marketers I take
that back you do buy the courses from
the gurus and the marketers but not to
read what's in the courses but to
reverse engineer how they're doing it
okay how they sold you how they sold you
what their funnels are like how often
are they emailing you are they texting
you are they calling you is there a vssl
a video sales letter is it is it a one
landing page that's a mile long on a
clickfunnels form like there is so much
more to learn from the funnels that
these guys employ than from the actual
content that they're selling but a lot
of times you have to buy the content
content to learn the funnels right yeah
yep because they wouldn't be using it if
it wasn't working exactly okay so this
is the eight step process for selling
anything in the world world as invented

[06:00]
anything in the world world as invented
by Frank ker and I only found this Nick
on the warrior Forum message boards you
went deep I went deep 16 years old I
found this oh my gosh all right so am I
gonna be like a a 70y old woman that
you're about to sell to exactly okay
here's how to sell anything in eight
steps okay number one here's what you
get okay you list out all the products
and features okay boom boom boom boom
you overwhelm them with value number two
establish the value all right this
product is worth $3,000 but you're
getting it for 30 this product is worth
da d da so list everything out all these
components combined are $177,000 but
we're giving it to you today for the low
price of
$6.99 exactly and we've seen this stuff
but we don't really know the framework
around it or why it's a framework number
three number three bonus and you know
what I shouldn't be doing this but go
ahead and buy this now I'm I'm going to
add B so now they're like oh my gosh
this is so much value only is it coming

[07:02]
this is so much value only is it coming
out of your paycheck I'm so sorry only
for the cost of a cup of coffee per day
I'm going to get all this okay the bonus
is number three number four price then
you drop the price okay you hit them
with the price but you're only halfway
through the steps you anchor them with a
high price and then by number four
you're already dropping the price yeah
because when when you hit the value it's
like oh my gosh this is
$25,000 worth of value like he's
probably going to give me a discount and
sell it to me for 20,000 right like I
guess that would be that's a good deal
for me 20,000 oh geez okay and then you
hit him with the price and you're like
it's only $4
4997 $5,000 that's it not 20 not 25 only
5,000 automatically they're like oh gez
that's a that's a big value but you're
not done you're only halfway through the
steps here number five you got to
trivialize the price this is a Frank
Kern quote an fkq okay okay trivialize

[08:00]
Kern quote an fkq okay okay trivialize
it which is like listen really if you if
you divide that out and amortise it over
30 years like a mortgage that's that's
only like the cost of a cup of coffee
per day right that's nothing really
$5,000 is nothing because how much is
tuition at a top tier University right
5,000 a semester Bare Bones right then
you add the guarantee and you know what
I shouldn't be doing this but full money
back guarantee you're literally stupid
if you don't take me up on this there's
no risk there's no risk and I'm glad I
just said risk because that's number
seven risk reversal honestly think of a
used car salesman honestly if if I sell
you this Camry for
9,800 I'm I'm kind of worried about my
job honestly my manager is not going to
be happy about this because he told me
out the door never sell this Camry for
under $122,000 you're going to get for
9800 so really I don't even I'm kind of
changing my mind honestly this is a big
risk for

[09:00]
risk for
right you turn it around I'm feeling
like I want to buy now wait wait wait
what are we talking about I don't want
you to get fired I don't want you I want
get a deal myself this is such a good
deal risk reversal that's number seven
that's at the end okay almost at the end
number eight this is the most important
scarcity you have to have scarcity and I
went to perplexity and I dug deep on
every time that Frank Kern has put an
offer out there with scarcity and I saw
a current modern-day example of it okay
so 13 years ago in the same Warrior
Forum which is a message board for
degenerate internet marketers okay 13
years ago there was this viral Message
Board post of this angry Guy saying
Frank Kar just released his new course
but what the heck the order page was
only open for 15 minutes and then he
closed it did he actually sell out or is
this y y y and then like everyone was
arguing saying like it doesn't matter

[10:00]
arguing saying like it doesn't matter
it's genius we're all arguing about it
and talking about it because his order
page was only open for 15 minutes he
only let people buy it for 15 minutes he
might have sold four he might have sold
4,000 we don't know but he was doing
that 13 years ago and he's doing that
today and I'll give you an example in a
minute so you think there's something to
it right scarcity you got to have
scarcity why would you not have scarcity
when selling anything Nick give me a
good reason I'll listen I mean it's fomo
fomo scarcity yeah we don't do it you
have to instill some sense of urgency
why now right because it we may think
it's the best offer we may see all the
benefits we may know it may actually
help us but if we don't have a
motivation to do it now we'll put it off
or we'll forget about it or you know
something will happen in the intervening
time period so you have to build in a
mentality of urgency and scarcity does
that yeah I mean look at like
conferences conferences sell half of
their tickets the day leading up to
their event but they start selling
tickets a year in advance six months in
advance there's no scarcity there's no

[11:00]
advance there's no scarcity there's no
sense of urgency I had this name Spencer
on my podcast he has he does music
festivals Lantern festivals what's your
podcast called economics the podcast
exploring businesses anyways so on my
podcast you only allow 10 downloads per
episode right so yeah honestly that
actually might be a really cool that's a
really cool idea we should think about
just like a way to start something in a
podcast or social media it's like it's
Snapchat is scarcity right like I can
only see it once and it disappears
that's just a whole framework apply
scarcity to anything scarcity is a
service right be a scarcity consultant
Nick and you I only pick two clients
yeah I've got I sell a SAS product
what's SAS a scarcity as a
service killer
multiples anyways he was he was saying
they had I think 200,000 people that
attended their events last year and then
50% of their tickets they they sell in
in the last week and they do it on

[12:01]
in the last week and they do it on
purpose so you can you can buy for a
year but they wait till the last week
because they know that if somebody goes
to buy they're going to be okay paying a
higher price because they're like yeah I
could have bought this ticket a year ago
but I didn't know a year ago so of
course it's triple the price now yeah
makes sense like in your mind you're
already justifying it and and like it's
part of their strategy so yeah you have
to have scarcity in any model that
you're offering yeah but we don't do it
like we all know this but we break our
own rules all the time here's a couple
of I guess tactics that I saw in those
anchoring so like he anchors you in a
couple of like the price oh that's a lot
of money then he brings you down right
or he anchors you explain from a
negotiations perspective what anchoring
is oh thank you it's a great question
Chris so if I'm negotiating with You
Chris so scried and I want to buy and I
want to buy your house and you think
your house is worth a million dollar and
I think your house is worth
probably a million dollars I know that

[13:02]
probably a million dollars I know that
there's going to be some back and forth
if I offer you a million you're going to
say oh that's the floor I bet I could
get more and you're going to come back
and we're going to go back and forth and
we'll probably settle at like 1.2
million or something like that even
though we both went into the negotiation
thinking the house is worth $1 million
so what I'll do is I'll anchor you I'll
come in with a very lowball offer I'll
say $500,000 and what that does is it
reframes in your mind not only the value
of your house but my perspective Ive as
a buyer all of a sudden it goes from oh
this guy has a lot more money to he's
only offering $500,000 I guess if I move
him up to $900,000 I I just almost
doubled his offer right or even if you
get a million it's like oh well I
started at 500 but I got up to a million
so there's a psychological effect on the
part of the buyer who's like oh I got a
win here it just starts the negotiations
at a much better place because you know
there's going to be this Back in Forth
haggling and that's what he does he
anchors you at this the value of this is
$25,000 names all the benefits goes

[14:00]
$25,000 names all the benefits goes
through it blah BL and you're thinking
in your head oh man I can't afford this
and then hits you with a actually I
could offer it to you for 500 bucks and
then he reinforces it over and O I
probably lose my job oh I don't know you
know like the reverse risk tons of
emotional
manipulation tons of emotional
manipulation I'm probably gonna lose my
job for this but I think I can I think
do that I think I can get this figured
out the guarantee man you're creating a
no risk scenario for
people and and the reason the no risk
scenario is so important is not because
you're worried about giving the rebate
or the refund but you know that most
people are not going to get the refund
do you know there are billions of
dollars worth of gift cards that have
gone unclaimed MH and it's because
people have those gift cards and they
just don't spend it they just keep it
there like that's real money on a
princip yeah we're human that's not even
a refund that's just oh I had the money
there and I didn't do anything with it
so the guarantee makes you

[15:00]
so the guarantee makes you
psychologically feel like oh there's no
risk to this but you also know that a
certain percentage of those people are
never going to even call to get the
guarant yeah yeah and like I talked
about this about LCD cycle on a podcast
earlier this week we started the
lifetime return policy we were the first
company in the industry to do it and I
just assumed all right three to five% of
people are going to do that so let's
just raise our prices by three to 5% and
that's a guess I could be way wrong and
we could you know have to reverse that
decision but it was more like 2% so we
nett it out ahead and now everyone in
that industry does it well and it's
really smart from a selling perspective
because what you're trying to do in any
environment is build trust like you need
them to trust you in order for the S to
close and by offering the guarantee even
if they never use the guarantee it's
like oh they're willing to give a
guarantee oh I trust them and their
product right and many people use that
for evil I think people who have good
intentions use that a lot of times but
here are the Frameworks that I thought
sorry go ahead I was goingon to say it's
like we've talked about like to sell
anything you you need to get someone

[16:00]
anything you you need to get someone
from like they don't know who you are
they don't trust you to they're your
good friend because we buy from our
friends and family right so getting them
to trust us a little more just moves
them further down that Spectrum totally
all right so here are some of the
Frameworks that I saw as you're talking
the first one is Alex didn't reinvent
anything he just copied he took exactly
what's been done and he copied it and a
lot of times we think oh well I've got
to add my spin on this I've got to do
something new like just just go copy
what's already working like naturally
though when we copy something we're
going to add it to our personal
experience of let's say turning around
gyms right and it will become our own
naturally but we don't have to like be
deliberate and purposeful like all right
I can't just copy this I got to make
this no like copy it and then see where
that takes you and then it naturally
will become your own before I move on I
just think that there's I've fallen into
this trap where I want to do something
social media for example oh I want to
post this video okay Nick do this thing
and that's what's going to work no

[17:01]
and that's what's going to work no
everybody does that I want to do my own
thing and then you learn you're like
well there's a reason why everybody does
follow me for more because a lot higher
percentage of people actually follow you
if they read your posts right if it's
working it's working for a reason Don't
Be Afraid or ashamed to copy I think
this the second thing that I found
interesting just just hearing about that
is and I was you and I talked to James
camp this week my episode's not going to
come out for a little while but one of
the things he said was people crap on
course creators or information
sellers he's like but anybody who's
built a business anybody who's like
actually gone through the process and
scaled and
sold understands how operationally
intensive it is to build something of
value and so when you see money coming
in from selling Knowledge from selling a
course or access or coaching and you're
like wow I can do this and make this
living without having to do all of the
operational headache it's very
understandable why they sell info
products and I I think anybody who
hasn't done it just does not have an
appreciation for the decision- making

[18:02]
appreciation for the decision- making
process and yeah oh they're a guru oh
they're just selling people on the dream
like but until you've actually built
something and you understand how hard
that is you also don't understand the
appeal of this is cool I get to help
people at scale I get to sell an idea
and information this is much easier than
scaling up a business well dude like to
support your point I I forgot to tell
you in Frank K story before he sold $14
million worth of pet training manuals he
bought a course for $50 from someone and
that him skills to sell those so that
like a set the president for him selling
a course because he knew it was a thing
B helped him make $14 million I just
posted about this there's a lot of
crapping on core Sellers and I think for
good reason there's some weird stuff
that people do like I heard some of them
have have Hardline sales tactics with
they'll have you finance the course or
they're like it's only $10,000 and you
can Finance it and it's like yeah people
who can't afford it I don't know how I
feel about financing but whatever put
that put that to the side but I posted

[19:01]
that put that to the side but I posted
if you're going to buy a business you
need to either buy a course attend a
boot camp or hire a coach all right if
you are watching this clip right now you
are watching this on YouTube and if you
are a fan of podcast please check out my
podcast while you're at it because
sometimes I have podcasts that aren't on
YouTube and sometimes I have YouTubes
that aren't on podcast so check out the
ker office on any podcast platform or
you can go to TKO pod.com also my
newsletter will throw that in there
there are no ads It's weekly it's
different content than my podcast and
YouTube newsletter. chrisj cerner.com
you'll see the link and we'll see you
there and then I got some people who are
like well actually why didn't why you
should actually have a CPA and a lawyer
and it's like yeah those are table
Stakes no duh like of course I have to
have a CPA do with my quality of
earnings of course I have to have a
lawyer write up the purchase agreement
of course I need to have potentially a
broker that I pay help me understand
what's going on in this Mar like of
course I'm not saying that but if you're
going into something and you have no
experience it's a cheat code I'm going
to pay someone to teach me quickly and I
can jump the line have to go through the
iterative process I I think there's a

[20:01]
iterative process I I think there's a
real place in the market for people who
sell info products it's funny we talked
about Alex horos just copying Frank Kern
because Frank Kar he just copied this
guy named Gary Halbert remember the
national Inquirer yeah yeah yeah like
the crazy sensationalist headlines that
was all Gary Halbert and Gary Halbert
had this framework that he called The
Desperate nerd Theory which was
basically like even this freaking idiot
over here lost 80 pounds right you could
like he invented this direct response
style marketing Frank Kern learned from
him put his own spin on it Alex Heros
learned from him so on and so forth and
before Gary Halbert there was a dude
named Claude Hopkins who had this
marketing method that he called
scientific ad advertising that basically
appeared to or appealed to First
principles that Ela mus always talks
about to get people to buy more of your
stuff so like there's always been
marketers nothing's original right yeah
okay so two more Frameworks one
framework was or not framework but just

[21:00]
framework was or not framework but just
observation he went from selling payment
processors to selling what was it pet
training videos or pet training no
credit card terminals okay credit card
terminals to pet courses essentially and
you look at that on its face and you're
like the freak was that but there's two
things in there number one when you
start the process yep you you sometime
you don't know where you're going to
finish it's so you need to be flexible
I'd be really fascinated to hear how he
went from credit card terminals to pet
so because I'm sure maybe he went door
to door and it was like no everybody
kept talking about their pets and I had
this idea like there's something in
there that he saw and he was flexible
and he moved on it the second piece of
it is the only reason he was able to
take advantage of that is because he had
obviously amazing sales
skills he had this skill set he was
trying to apply it to this credit card
terminal process or whatever wasn't
working then he sees the pets and he's
like cool I can apply my skill set here
so it's like he had no Pride about it he
just saw what was working and he moved
to where it was working so I think those
two observations are really interesting
sometimes you don't know what the idea

[22:00]
sometimes you don't know what the idea
is going to be until you actually get in
the weeds and start working on it and
then two you really need to be
opportunistic about where your
particular skill set works and then go
all in it once you see something working
yeah like I bet I bet you anything he
started going door too he's probably
desperate broke he sees some success he
learns how to sell and he's like okay
there's something to this sales thing
and you know what there's something to
this credit card industry thing but
going door too sucks hm well I heard
about this internet thing so what if we
sell credit card
processors or like the actual Hardware
on the internet so then he starts doing
that oh wow internet money is pretty
cool but like shipping stuff really
sucks this is not fun how can I keep
making internet money without having to
ship stuff hm what about like an audio
book that people download and like you
in retrospect you can see the dots that
he connected but in the moment he was
just freaking trying stuff he was
testing everything except drugs maybe
drugs too I don't know there's a million
examples of this too right Amazon
started selling books on the internet
then all of a sudden they started
selling a bunch of productss on the

[23:00]
selling a bunch of productss on the
internet and then they started growing
and they're like oh crap we have demand
let's start selling these products CU so
they start adding more product skes then
they have so much demand their servers
are out of whack so they got to find
more and more server space in order to
meet the demand of people going online
and buying their products then they get
to the point where they're like the
server space is a cost center it's so
expensive for us how could we solve this
problem oh I don't know maybe let's buy
some servers ourselves let's stand up
our own server Center so then they stand
up what what has become AWS Amazon web
services and they start building it out
and they realize hm we have all this
excess capacity because we bought all
these servers we're doing it for growth
all these other companies have a need
too let's start selling our excess
server space and now the most profitable
unit of their business is Amazon web
services if you look at any
profitability from Amazon it is not from
their Core Business which is selling
things online it is mainly from Amazon
web services and it all came from this
like you start as a bookstore online to
Amazon web services doesn't make sense
but you look at the dots that connected
and Jeff Bezos was obviously
maneuverable enough to say and seiz the
opportunities when he saw them
exactly dude the whole reason I found

[24:02]
exactly dude the whole reason I found
out or I dug deep on Frank karna is
because we were supposed to bring an an
AI idea to this episode right and so I
start looking we've talked about high
level a few times they have these Awards
ceremonies every year called the SAS
preneur Awards and there they have the
silver gold and platinum award silver
award means you have over 100 SAS
customers on their platform gold is 500
Platinum is a thousand so okay if anyone
listen this Google's SAS preneur award
go high level you'll see this list
they're awarding these two affiliate
marketers customers that are white
labeling high level to build businesses
yeah okay got it and so if I'm like
looking for ideas I'll go to this
website and look at who won all the
awards for 2024 and I know I can reverse
engineer what their Mr is because I know
how many customers they have and I can
see on their website what they're
charging okay so I was doing this and
one of the Awards it's it's amazing one

[25:00]
one of the Awards it's it's amazing one
of the Gold Award winners was it was
called rain maker AI so I go to this
website and I had no idea what it was or
who was behind Rainmaker AI or what it
even did so I go to this website and
it's Rainmaker ai.com and it says rain
Mak this is the whole website there's
nothing you can click on Rainmaker AI
has done the unthinkable all what tell
me more dear dear friend and like that's
copywriting right copywriting is yeah
person get the person to the next
sentence do whatever you can to just get
them to the next sentence okay so rain
maker AI has done the unthinkable I have
to keep reading because what did they do
right what I can't even think of it yeah
so it says we have stopped accepting new
customers okay why would I keep reading
I want to know why okay all right the
reason why is we already have a lot of
existing customers who pay us every
month oh geez why do you have so many
customers that sounds nice how can I
have a lot of C to quote Greece tell me
more Tommy

[26:00]
more Tommy
more they okay they are awesome and we
really like them a lot also notice this
is very much Donald Trump language and
people have studied this he speaks at
like a third or fourth grade reading
level and that's what's the website
Rainmaker ai.com Rainmaker
ai.com let me reread this for you okay
dear friend we've stopped accepting new
customers the reason why is we already
have a lot of customers the most the
best customers who pay us every month
they're awesome we like them a lot
they're the best they just called me
yesterday they said Hey listen here AI
rain maker you're the best customer
we've ever had and I said that's
true a lot of people I'm getting a lot
of people who are coming to me they're
sending me their worst customers I don't
want those customers I want the best all
right sorry keep going he's a marketer
dude he's the freaking best he is so
love him or hate him that guy is a Sant
when it comes to Mark Mark yeah and
people anyway so
is using a third grade reading level

[27:00]
is using a third grade reading level
they are awesome and we really like them
a lot like my eight-year-old would write
that sentence
okay so true so it's like on the base
level wow this guy's an idiot he doesn't
know how to write on the C you know go a
little deeper this guy's a genius
because he's writing like an idiot okay
yep yep so next line so we're putting
100% of our focus on creating the best
experience possible for them when we're
ready to take on customers you'll know
thanks for stopping by so I'm like what
is going on here who doesn't and my
first thought was all right so they went
out of business got it okay and then I
keep diving in Rainmaker and it's like
oh this is Frank kar's company this is
like his his go high level wh labeled
CRM business dashboard that he's selling
to people that buy his course only so he
doesn't need a landing page because he's
pushing this to people on his email list
through a different URL it's scarcity
it's more scarcity and when they get it
and they click on it they're like oh

[28:00]
and they click on it they're like oh
what what is this click we're not
accepting new customers oh wow Frank's
letting me now I want it oh yeah crap
this software is only being accepted by
people he invites and he invited me oh
my gosh all right I guess I'll do it I
guess I'll give him a lot more of my
grandma's life
savings that's incredible how much money
is that one doing you reverse engineered
it how much money are they doing I don't
know what he's charging for it because
I'm not in his community but he has 500
to a th000 customers and a lot of people
are selling this same thing right and
they usually cost between 200 and 400 a
month so to the end user or to or to go
high level no they pay go high level
tiny fraction to the end user okay so
let's just say 400 for Math's sake so
400 times how many users in his
community let's say 500 so is that
200,000 a month 20,000 a month and it's
white labeled 2002 200,000 it's $200,000

[29:01]
white labeled 2002 200,000 it's $200,000
a month his go high level bill is maybe
a couple thousand dollar like with all
those sub accounts jeez Louise dude it's
all customer acquisition yeah dude we've
talked about this before when a venture
company goes and raises money and they
raise it a oh it's a $50 billion
valuation and they raised $100
million do you know where 50 cents of
every dollar
goes It goes to Facebook and it goes to
Google to acquire customers that's not
an opinion that is a fact because the
majority of those dollars are spent
getting their name out there and
acquiring customers so if you can
understand sales and marketing and you
build a distribution through social
media or this you know Frank has figured
out how to leverage the internet the
most expensive part of your business
which is the customer acquisition cost
all of a sudden becomes the biggest
profit Center of your business because
youve figured out a way to do it better
than 99% of people and that's that's why
Alex Heros is successful this Frank Kern

[30:00]
Alex Heros is successful this Frank Kern
is successful that's why these course
creators are successful like marketing
and sales I used to crap on and not
think that it was important it's as
important if not more important than any
other aspect of the business I don't
care how cool your product is or how
good your operations are if you don't
know how to Market and sell you're done
you have no business where do you think
the other 50% is going okay I'll tell
you overhead and salaries salaries to
coders and developers which AI can
basically do now and is growing by Leaps
and Bounds every day therefore the
marketers are about to have their Heyday
again so marketing is more important
than ever attention is more important
than ever because AI is taking all those
binary tasks like code and and
democratizing it so on that note I
haven't I I've been thinking a lot about
AI since our last conversation because
our last episode was just all AI ideas
which was fun it was awesome and it just
got me thinking I'm like we have a lot
of these types of ideas let's keep
talking about them I I have a framework
that I've been thinking about I want to
talk it through with you and see what

[31:00]
talk it through with you and see what
you
think I think there's two possible
investment strategies when it comes to
artificial
intelligence I think the first strategy
is a cigarette cigarette butt strategy
have you heard of this I don't think so
okay so the cigarette butt investing
philosophy strategy is what Warren
Buffett started his investment career at
where you're just trying to extract as
much value as possible out of something
that has lost a ton of value and is
probably going to continue to lose value
I think um blanking on his name Warren
Buffett was a pupil of a famous investor
and I'm anyways um at Columbia
University Warren Buffett offered to
work for him for free and the the famous
investor was like it's too expensive
because he knew how much it would cost
but this was his strategy the cigarette
butt strategy where they would see
declining businesses and they'd buy into
them so some examples of this would be
like Philip Morris well around the World
smoking cigarettes literal cigarette but

[32:01]
smoking cigarettes literal cigarette but
strategy yeah these types of of products
are consistently decreasing in their
total volume because people are getting
healthier and they're focusing on
healthier things however the business is
still exceptionally profitable and so
for the next 50 years it's still going
to make really good money but it's it's
a it's a shrinking Market over time
Warren's first investment was in an
investment butt type of a business it
was called Berkshire
haway haway was a Tex yeah it was a
textile company and the the textile
company was dein and year over year over
year and I can't remember his exact
thesis on it but it was like oh the
value of this business on the balance
sheet is greater than it's currently
worth I can get in there extract the
value and that was it was a reverse I
think it was a reverse public anyways I
can't quite remember what the
circumstances were around it but that
was his first investment and then it
changed he and Charlie merer got
together and and they decided to then
we're just gonna buy great businesses at
a fair price right and that to me is the
investment strategy number two I thought
wait I thought Andrew Wilkinson invented
that

[33:02]
oh dude I can't wait to make a video
with you where we talk about the top 10
red flags somebody says who's not an
entrepreneur that is one of my top 10
red flags is somebody who's just like I
don't know I just I just want to buy a
good great business at a fair price ah I
don't know stupid it's the it's the
non-lds equivalent of saying oh my
management style I don't know I try to
teach them principles and let them
govern themselves I don't know quirky
like that I don't I don't know where I
got that from but I probably made it up
originally by myself to me those are
kind of two investment philosophies one
is I'm going to extract as much value as
I can knowing that there's a finite
shelf life on this because there's still
value there but people are are fleeing
it because it's not as longterm or I'm
gonna buy a great sustainable business
with a moat sticky customers all of
these other parameters and I'm gonna
invest in that over time because it's a
great business so and what's the other
like let's just say long term okay yeah

[34:02]
like let's just say long term okay yeah
so I think that applies to AI I think
that a lot of businesses that we talk
about our cigarette butt businesses oh
we could implement this AI process to do
X Y and Z like we're accelerating the
transition to artificial intelligence we
are eliminating those positions but
after a certain amount of time the
ability to implement them
or the actual usefulness of those AI
tools is just going to be ubiquitous and
so starting up an agency to implement
this or a company that's just built
around coding and collections it's just
they're going to not not exist but that
market and opportunity that Tam is going
to disappear over time because there's a
short window of time where you can take
advantage of it that I think is the C
about strategy and I think there's a ton
of cool applications for it but I
started thinking about sort of this
long-term strategy where it's like what
is not going to be replaced by AI what
are the things that are going to even
with AI probably become even more
important
and so that's the investment philosophy
what do you think of the way I'm

[35:00]
what do you think of the way I'm
thinking about it yeah I'm I'm totally
with you and there's a milon things I
can say right now okay so from there I
took it a step further do you remember
in the 90s when we watched
cable I still do when I go to hotels
okay when you turn it on you're at the
mercy of whoever the cable provider is
and their and their programming yeah we
talked about remember Jerry Springer
stopped the scroll that's right that's
right that is so funny second highest
rated episode ever so over time people
didn't want that they wanted to be able
to watch what they wanted to watch when
they wanted to watch it and so we got an
unbundling mhm with Netflix and Amazon
Prime and all the other
streamers so you went from this old
model in technology to this new model
which was streaming online and now the
new model is doing what Chris they're
rebundling you've got Thursday Night
Football on Amazon Prime you've got
Sports you've got video game you've got
a million Live Events now on Netflix
they're like rebundling these things and
these streaming providers are going

[36:01]
these streaming providers are going
bankrupt and selling to the other
streaming providers and so there's
consolidation happening and I think
there's this really interesting
framework that happens where what's old
has become new again and you see it with
Trends in fashion you see it with music
you see it in the business Cycles you
sound like you wanted to say something
there's a famous famous I I don't know
if anyone that knows about this tweet
than I do but I never sometimes you see
a tweet you never forget it right rent
free in my head January 17th 2022 Jim
Gaffigan the famous comedian tweeted
they should bundle all the streaming
services together and call it
cable 1,000
retweet yes that's why I'm smiling it's
so good dude oh my gosh so so I've got
these two these two ideas that were just
popping in my head one was the cigarette
butt and the long-term investment and
then the other was
what's old again or what's old has

[37:00]
what's old again or what's old has
become new again and I started thinking
how could I apply that to Ai and there
are some examples that are already
happening in-person
events we went from Community being in
real life to digitizing it and moving it
to social social media social platforms
and now we're seeing a big shift to
community again in person events detox
events conferences experiences those
types of things and I think it's a
really interesting framework to apply to
thinking about Ai and the age of AI and
the opportuni so here's I I made my
first principles and I'm going to list
them out for
you I think prioritizing human
interaction so businesses that
prioritize human interaction healthare
gyms Fitness
conferences focus on fundamental human
needs healthare food purpose religion
scale your authen it so it has to feel
like a human have you noticed on social

[38:00]
like a human have you noticed on social
media when you read posts now like I've
written some posts recently that are
freaking bangers amazing hook amazing
post here are the top 10 reasons why you
should start a franchise today making $4
million a year like two years ago that
would have been a banger post and
amazing but now people are seeing it
it's like it's too good it's too good of
a post oh too curated yeah it's too Cur
even though you didn't use AI to write
it it just it's too good it's so like
people are are self- selecting to things
that are authentic so my daughter my
12-year-old daughter would call this
being a tryhard or a Pik me that's
that's it called being a pikme also
shout out to my daughter her and her
friend made made this at a farmers
market at least shout out shut up and
then the last two so leveraging the
human nature so like I think face Toof
face interaction ju th just aspects of
human nature that that persist over time
and independent of Technology ology so a
physical hug a handshake meeting in

[39:01]
physical hug a handshake meeting in
person those types of things that's like
my framework that I've created that I I
want to start thinking about more and
when we talk about AI ideas it's not
just going to be hey what's the thing we
can automate to get us faster to the
implementation of AI it's also the hey
what's the business that's going to be
sticking around even after AI has taken
over and we have way more free time than
we know what to do what are things that
people are still going to want and how
could you create a business around that
I just find it so fascinating how the
pie just keeps growing like like we've
been expecting automation technology AI
to take all of our jobs for years now
and the opposite is happening right just
look at people that want to start
businesses the aspiring business owner
how many of them from over the next five
years are going to go start a tree
trimming business versus an AI
app right right like anything home
services is going to be already a huge
opportunity it was a huge opportunity 5
years ago 10 years ago it's going to be

[40:01]
years ago 10 years ago it's going to be
even more so of an opportunity because
all the attention is going to AI going
to the internet and Technology more than
it ever has been so it's just a bigger
pie it's a rising tide right I'm a th%
with you we're all going to benefit more
that's it for today folks part two is a
week from today on holdor Bros I'm not
exaggerating part two of this episode is
one of the best we've ever recorded all
AI ideas super high energy I got a
headache come back a week from today to
hear that
