[00:00]
welcome to the ker office for another
episode of hold cob Bros we continue our
conversation from last week where we
talk about pricing transparency lead
generation we talk about creating
products for business owners and how to
find and capitalize on distressed
business opportunities also we talked
about the custom home building industry
a bit because I had a startup in that
space once so I think you'll find that
interesting anyway please like And
subscribe leave me a rating review five
stars only thank you very much and we'll
see you next time
okay so last week we were talking about
programmatic SEO a lot right so handed
it m here's another idea that I didn't
even connect with programmatic SEO but
you could use that uh to help grow this
business so this is a User submitted
idea this is not my business idea I will
credit to the person who sent it to me
which I can't remember his name so sorry
guy but I think it was Dragon Slayer 69
yeah yeah that was
it anyway so last episode we also talked
about custom home building a little bit

[01:00]
about custom home building a little bit
and how I wrote an ebook for that and
one thing that's very difficult about
home renovations or custom home building
is knowing what everything should cost
okay the price of a kitchen renovation
in San Francisco is completely different
from the price of a kitchen renovation
in Omaha Nebraska or building a home I
was just I saw a tweet yesterday of this
guy said hey home builders please tell
me like what you're charging nowadays
per square foot for a starter home
basically is what he said and there was
a guy in California that said $400 per
square foot and there was a guy in the
Southeast that said $98 per square foot
okay crazy and neither one included the
land and so I encountered this struggle
when we hired a custom home builder
because we didn't know what we should
pay and it's like even if you know all
right he's going to charge 130 a foot
you don't know what this tile should
cost or what the carpet should cost or
what an like do you charge extra for the
bathrooms because those cost more per
square foot or is it all included in
lumps on price you just don't know this
stuff the idea here is a glass door for

[02:00]
stuff the idea here is a glass door for
things like this so glass door is unique
because people can anonymously submit
what they make what their salary is for
a specific company a specific area
specific job specific uh degree there
needs to be a glass door for something
like this to make these costs
transparent uh by market and it's a
little difficult because you can use
programmatic to grow it for sure but you
still need the User submitted content
like it needs to be actual real content
but once you have this the monetization
angles are endless right like you could
sell ads to home builders or you could
sell leads to home like how much is a a
custom homeb building lead worth what do
you think about this I think first of
all I love it I think there's a lot of
industries that can apply to I'm
thinking in healthcare for example you
donated a kidney the cost to donate a
kidney for example that surgery is
dramatically different depending on the
hospital you go to and it's just because
there's no pricing transparency and the
government like tries to give pricing

[03:00]
government like tries to give pricing
transparency but there isn't really a
good platform or mechanism that allows
people to see exactly what the charges
are and how they compare across
different Healthcare settings so that's
just an example but then it's like every
other Home Service right what do you do
when you want to get a remodel on your
house you get three quotes what do you
do when you want to go buy a car you get
three quotes like you're doing the work
anyways to go out and find like what is
the market rate and that's where for for
the businesses on the other side of the
equation there's a lot of Arbitrage
right because they have asymmetric
information you as the buyer don't know
what market rate is and so they can
quote you anything and even if they
quote you $200 and market rate is 100
and you decide to haggle with them and
they're like oh cool I got you down to
150 they're still $50 above Market you
know what I mean so I think any of these
platforms that allow for pricing
transparency in typically opaque markets
like custom home building like health

[04:00]
like custom home building like health
is a really cool idea so yes I love the
idea I just thought of two ways you
could build this like you could build
out the content for this cuz that will
be the hardest part so I don't remember
if it was a podcast with you or or a
different one of building a moat it was
us building a moat via tedious tasks
remember that one how plaid the the
fintech company they connected all these
tiny Credit Union apis any developer
could do that but they did it for
everyone and it took a lot of time and a
lot of money but that became their
intellectual property that became their
moat right just these all these random
API Integrations that no one wanted to
spend the time to fix you could do that
with hiring a virtual assistant to call
so scrape every custom home builder in
the
country and it's great because a lot of
the phone numbers listed I guarantee you
are going to be the owner of the
business because they're pretty small
hire a VA with a script to pose as a
potential interested customer and say
hey what are you charging nowadays per
square foot to build a home and they're

[05:00]
square foot to build a home and they're
like every single one of them are like
oh I don't know it depends like would
you want hand scrap wood floors you want
there's so many things and they're going
to be trained to get through all that
noise M listen listen listen I know but
like for the average quality of build
you're doing like what are you averaging
out at 180 foot okay cool and does that
include XYZ like asphalt shingles or
terracotta or they have some like very
specific features that move the needle a
lot right and then everything else
they'll just ignore and then they're
putting it into a database and so it's
just one or two vas just hitting the
phones putting it all in a database
there's your database right now you can
use programmatic to pull users to that
or you could do basically the same thing
with a VA and just join a zillion
Facebook groups and ask the question hey
what did you pay for your home and when
did you build you right and you could
just that's a little more tedious
because you know maybe a post doesn't
get much action whereas if you call
someone you can control that or not so
you don't have to like build a community

[06:00]
you don't have to like build a community
of people to submit all this to you you
could go out and grab it from them I
like the idea and this wasn't what you
were saying but hearing you talk about
it of using
vas to almost negotiate on your
behalf where it's like I don't know
which custom home builder to go with and
again we definit figure out the pricing
but you then go to Chris's company and
like hey I have this team of vas they'll
call around for you give us your specs
we'll bring you the best prices and you
can make a decision right and then the
homeowner can take a look at that stuff
and make an assessment on what they want
to spend their money on or like which of
those home builders they want to go
after right because lot of people just
don't like making phone calls they don't
want like it's just awkward they have
anxiety a ton of people like that people
don't like public speaking they don't
like talking on the phone it's a real
thing but like in the process of that
you're also capturing that data and
putting it in a database right so you're
like it's almost like the uh Tesla
Strate y of first the road Roadster then

[07:01]
Strate y of first the road Roadster then
the model S then the model 3 where High
ticket first building a lot of the
infrastructure the knowhow and
experience that'll then allow them to
get to the model 3 which was their their
mass-produced electric vehicle like this
would be a business that kind of helps
people negotiate prices or at least get
the data that they need in order to make
an informed decision if specifically for
custom home building or for anything
let's just say customer Home Building
first right let's just say that that was
the first business that we did this with
is you tried to rank for people who are
looking to find customer home builders
and I I don't know what it would be but
it was like hey we help you find the
best custom home builder and and
basically the process was we call around
we get their prices and there's probably
a number of things that people care
about right do they help with
architecture where are they getting
their supplies from whatever you put
that all on the questionnaire and then
you aggregate this data and then you
feed it to the homeowner and they're
then able to make a decision or
determination on which one they want to
meet with and then a decision of who
they want to work with

[08:00]
they want to work with
but it's a way to be generating that
data and information but get but be
getting paid for it at the same time as
opposed to just generating the
information building the database and
then figuring out the monetization model
later I really like the concept of that
I would probably do it in a different
industry because if you did that you
would have to find people that are about
to want a custom home which is like so
Niche would be really hard to do that in
fact we Ed and I were trying to do that
when we had our business it's like how
do you find someone in that phase life
where like they're about to start
shopping around that's a really valuable
person to find but a hard person to find
so I love the idea of doing that you
basically you're doing research and
negotiation as a service for a high
ticket purchase right so maybe it's like
a car right like you're gonna because
that's the worst experience ever
everyone knows it and so maybe the VA
calls dozens of dealerships and they all
have a Toyota Sienna because that's for
sure what they want and you're asking
all these annoy annoying ticky tacky

[09:00]
all these annoy annoying ticky tacky
details like was it smoked in yada y
yada you present it all and then you
present the information to the potential
car buyer and they say okay I love these
three I don't like the other nine I love
these three I want you to pit these
people against each other so I can get
the best price and then they call him
back and say hey I was the guy that
asked a million questions about that car
okay I'm very interested but this
dealership right down the road you name
it by name they have this car which they
can see on the website you're not bsing
them they're $3,000 lower what can you
do and then the all the person has to do
is drive to the dealership and buy the
car at the predetermined price they're
it's done so it's not like a presto cars
model where you're buying cars at
wholesale for people and charging $800
fee it's using cheap Global Talent to do
this whole rigoll for someone in any
local market I like the idea of charging
a fee for that not a percentage based of
like potential savings because it's like
who knows if they're actually going to
buy the vehicle you may do all this work
and they don't actually buy the vehicle

[10:01]
and they don't actually buy the vehicle
but there are a lot of apps right like I
think true car is one of them Edmonds
CarMax is kind of that but they also
have physical
locations where they will have cars on
their app or their website and they're
listed and there's it's like it's a no
haggle process but that's the price it's
like the price is set there's a margin
in there that they're charging and it
makes sense but this is for people who
are like will you just do a for me I
like I don't want to I don't even want
to scour the internet can you just go
negotiate on my behalf this is what I
want bring me the best three options and
then we can make a determination I think
we've landed on actually a really good
idea here tell me Nick how much time
would it take for a VA to call 15 car
dealerships and have these conversations
and then present this data in a
spreadsheet to the end user and then to
call back five of the car dealerships
and negotiate with them how long would
that entire process take couple days
maybe

[11:00]
maybe and first of all a lot of the info
that they're going to be asking they
could get from the website so they don't
have to ask it but hear me like how many
hours would it take a VA to do the
research and then the negotiating
conservatively I think
conservatively four hours okay and a VA
could be like a good VA with a good
accent $6 an hour they're not selling
they're not even selling they're like a
they're like an inbound telemarketer
more than anything yes so $25 in labor
and what could you charge yeah let's
round it up and say $50 for a $30,000
car what's a reasonable fee to charge
for something like this I mean if you
could say that you save them $2,000 on
average charge them 500 bucks you know
what I mean like I was exactly I was
thinking
$500 you could also charge a percentage
of what the list price is on the website
versus what you you save them you could

[12:00]
versus what you you save them you could
yeah you definitely could do that that'd
be very alignment of Interest the sell
gets even better think about
this every time that like have you ever
gone and searched for a new car or
searched for a mortgage and then you put
your phone number in oh don't get
started I did this to my enemies I got
scammed by a guy on Craigslist once and
I put his phone number on
lendingtree.com that guy must have been
hating his life I have done that so
anyways everybody hates doing that it's
like I don't want to get my I'm going to
get hit up by like 15 different people
like hey have you made a decision yet
hey are you still on the market 6 months
later you're still getting text messages
the VA do all that crap you don't have
to give your phone number out they could
get a Google number that's in the area
so it doesn't look like you're out of
town or like or whatever any Google
number and they're the ones conversing
with the dealership and like the first
couple conversations with the dealership
anyways are over email or text right hey
this is Doug from the dealership I saw
you had an inquiry what are you
interested this weekend right and like
this I could go you know back and forth
kind of text exchange first and then you

[13:01]
kind of text exchange first and then you
hop on a call obviously you need to go
to the dealership at some point but to
me that's a big selling point as well
like hey you don't have to give your
phone number or email out to people like
I would much rather do that than oh I
could go to CarMax and I don't have to
haggle but I still have to give my
freaking phone number I still I get
emails all the time from CarMax this is
a really good idea someone should start
this I'm very bullish about this idea
because it's such a problem like we've
both been hearing for 20 years the worst
buying a used car buying a car is the
worst buyer's experience on the world
like it always has been it always will
be you're solving a real problem and
your offer is perfect hey you know what
I'm going to go buy this Sienna for you
I'm G to charge you zero dollars period
there's no deposit nothing you only pay
me based on 25% of what I save you from
the list price on the website it's a
great offer it's a real pain point that
you're actually solving and it's high
ticket and you could automate 80% of it
like you could literally set up these
zap a zaper integration to where these

[14:02]
zap a zaper integration to where these
used car sellers could be having email
conversations with AI the whole time
haggling back and forth and then you
only have the VA get them on the phone
once you've whittel it down to the last
three cars like at this point it
probably is AI just having a
conversation with AI you know what I
mean like at this point in the world you
and I are probably AI just talking take
me to the island I want to go I want to
go to the island oh I really like this
idea I do too I think that's a great
idea all right it kind of Dov tales on
my next idea before you go to that I
want to give one more idea of how to
scam a scammer okay it's it's good
content yeah so course you put their
phone number into lendingtree.com and
then Nick look at me you need to look
this is Devious so you need to look at
my
eyes you go to Facebook Marketplace and
you take the cutest picture of Golden
Retriever puppies you can find it has to
be a Golden Retriever and I have done
this and you post free golden Retriever
puppies and you put the address and the

[15:01]
puppies and you put the address and the
phone number of the person that scammed
you in there I promise you that person
will be hating their life all right if
you are watching this clip right now you
are watching this on YouTube and if you
are a fan of podcast please check out my
podcast while you're at it because
sometimes I have podcasts that aren't on
YouTube and sometimes I have YouTubes
that aren't on podcast so check out the
ker office on any podcast platform or
you can go to TKO pod.com also my
newsletter will throw that in there
there are no ads It's weekly it's
different content than my podcast and
YouTube newsletter. chrisj cerner.com
You'll see the link and we'll see you
there back to100 million doll offers
from Alex Bro mosy there is no greater
offer than a free golden retriever puppy
dude it works it's effective trust me
you are Dr Evil you're evil Chris sorry
proceed with your idea you've seen we've
all seen recently a lot of like AI is g
to do this in your business AI is going
to do that in your business automation
apis blah blah blah we've talked a
couple of times
I know you and I have spoken about it I

[16:00]
I know you and I have spoken about it I
heard you and Shannon talk about it like
of having an AI automation agency or
just having an AI company that comes and
helps businesses basically Implement AI
into their business which I still think
is a phenomenal idea but I've been
thinking about this recently as well
even having the AI automation agency
there's still an education problem they
just don't know what AI is right is it
chat DPT is it one of these llms is it
diffusion AI or it's like creating cool
pictures is it agents like I don't
really know what it is right so here's
what I'm thinking and I think it's very
simple if I was an enterprising young
man or woman I would create a five-part
short course on not what is
AI and not like how you can use AI today
in your business but also how do you
identify opportunities for AI in your
business cuz for me that's kind of the

[17:01]
business cuz for me that's kind of the
disconnect that I've seen is sure you
can educate someone on what AI is you
could even educate someone on like oh
here's all the places you could go you
could go to Huggy face to see who's the
best developer creating the best new
open source models or this is chat GPT
this is Claude this is whatever like
cool this is how AI works and these are
the tools great but how do I know what
tools to use how do I know where I
should put that in my business right
like there to me there's a disconnect
there so I think a solution to that
disconnect would be to create a little
course five videos 3 to five minutes in
length each like short these don't need
to be University level courses that just
get a business owner entrepreneur Boomer
anybody who doesn't know this stuff
educated enough to take the next step of
action is it based around tools like I'm
thinking like if this then videos right
like if this is your problem then this
tool is your answer kind of that that
type stuff not yet to me that would be

[18:01]
type stuff not yet to me that would be
the next step so this is exactly what I
would do and I even wrote this out I was
at the gym on the stair stepper and I
wrote this out
so I would go to chat GPT and I would
enter this exact
prompt I want to create a five-part
video course on how business owners can
use AI to
identify where they can use AI in their
businesses today make sure that each
section ties back to how it can apply to
their business for example when
explaining how llms work highlight the
fact that the more data they can easily
export from their businesses and feed
into these models the more tailored the
outcome will be for them part one should
be an overview explainer of what AI is
part two should be about the different
types of AI tools out there for example
chat Bots lm's autonomous agents part
three should be an explainer of how to
identify your Tech stack and how you can
export your data part four should be how

[19:01]
export your data part four should be how
to identify opportunities for AI
Automation in your business and part
five should be teaching them how to
assess the level of sophistication
needed from utilizing chat GPT to
programming autonomous agents I want
each video to be three to five minutes
in length written at a fifth grade level
please provide me a stepbystep guide to
create this course so that's the prompt
like and chat gbt will spit out an
answer for that and I like I did this
it's shocking how good the answer is
it's shocking like how specific it gets
it references exact tools it tells you
what websites to go to and even like the
explanations are really good in the
analogies that it gives for people and I
think that you could take this refine it
right you'd have to do a couple of
iterations on chat GPT and you could
create Five Short really good videos and
sell it as like a $50 product for
somebody who's like hey are you
interested to learn how AI Works how you

[20:00]
interested to learn how AI Works how you
qu your business Boom for sale is this a
video of like you like a talking head
video or like an animated explainer
video so what I would do is I would
record the video like this a talking
head
video but then I would overlay it with
animations showing them where they can
go and like I'm not good enough but I
know that there are AI tools that you
can use to create the animations for you
but I would probably go to an animator
that I know and and just like throw in
some stuff to each one of the videos and
because basically like the total length
of the videos is going to be 25 minutes
like 15 to 25 minutes and it will cost
you money it'll probably cost you if you
went like really high level with the
animations it would probably cost you $2
to $5,000 if you went really high level
with the animations but I think you
could also do it before between five to$
500 to $1,000 and I think you could
price it at like say $50 to $100 and so
if you sell five to 10 of those you've
recouped your cost essentially to create
the video but I like anyways I want to
get your take on it I'm gonna Kevin o

[21:02]
get your take on it I'm gonna Kevin o
you okay but how does it make
money that's sound a lot more aggressive
than I actually am I'm curious like what
is your monetization strategy I thought
I said that you're charging $50 to $100
for the course okay 50 to 100 what do
you think the distribution strategy is I
think you would have to be one of
obviously one of three ways either
you're somebody who's on social media
you have a social media following that's
probably going to be the hardest because
either you have it or you don't you
can't just that overnight you could find
a guy to go through though you could
find a guy little little p piggyback
Strat I think you could go to one of
these companies and we like we know one
company where they just focus on
Facebook in particular where it's like
okay you got to put some money behind
paid ads but once you get a
lead you know it's going to come in you
and you can convert it it's on a high
ticket course you could put some money
behind it to get it in front of people
so I think like those would probably be
the two ways that I would think of but
you're the distribution guy what would
you do first of all couple things going

[22:00]
you do first of all couple things going
on in my head right now I think there
should be a rule on this podcast where
it's like you can't bring up an idea
unless you bring up a way to distribute
that idea or the business right isn't
that a good because I think that's kind
of what like a true Guru like a slimy
Guru they're just like all idea no
execution no distribution right ideas
are cheap right we all know that
execution is what matters and I think
that's what's special about when you and
I talk and other episodes on this
podcast is it they're almost always tied
to an execution strategy a distribution
strategy and I've always LED with that
like I Love Thinking of a cool
distribution idea and then putting an
idea into it as opposed to the other way
around oh it reminds me of something
else we got to talk about so I'm just
saying like you did that but that should
be like a rule where if one of us brings
up an idea not a way to execute it it's
like no no no no raise your hand like
dude you gotta I need more than that bro
I don't know because I'm not as good at
the distribution side of things right
would be like I'd want to hear your idea

[23:00]
would be like I'd want to hear your idea
yeah yeah okay yeah well that counts
right that would count we just can't
gloss over the execution which you
didn't I'm just saying moving forward
all right anyway I love the idea and I'm
going to hopefully level it up right
here so I think your price point needs
to be right at what your CPA your C per
acquisition would be on a Facebook ad I
think you take that prompt you find tune
it perfectly you're good to go and then
you say all right now take all that and
make it for plumbers okay
okay perfect cool now you go run
Facebook ads to plumbers and you sell it
for let's say you start at cheap $20 and
then you see that your CPA is 40 it cost
$40 for someone to give you 20 okay now
we're going to raise it to 60 and you
keep raising or lowering the price until
your cost per acquisition because
there's no cost to fulfill it's all it's
a digital product your cost per
acquisition is right around what the
cost of the product is that way your
your cost per acquisition is effectively

[24:00]
your cost per acquisition is effectively
zero correct which means you're not done
yet and then the high ticket offer is to
get them on the phone set up automations
to where you're asking you're holding
them accountable hey did you do it did
you do the course how did it go have you
implemented anything this is these are
all automations get them to respond get
them on the phone and then you sell a
Consulting offer one hour a week on the
phone on Zoom they could be anywhere in
the world 3,000 a month and so that's
like the ultimate end game here is to
use freaking AI to create something to
compete with itself to get 10 customers
that will make you $30,000 a month and
take you five to 10 hours a week so you
would take this course in essentially
turn it into a lead magnet yeah I was
gonna tie thank you I was going to tie
it back to that last episode the lead
magnet like and Lead magnets are often
paid this is strategically introduced
friction it's C
right they're paying for themselves to
become they're paying to become your

[25:01]
become they're paying to become your
customers yeah that's interesting that
would be a really good lead I wasn't
even I I genuinely wasn't thinking of it
as a lead magnet but that would be a
freaking really good lead magnet for the
AI automation company yeah and I've been
talking to my friend Trey who I I talk
about a lot who kind of has a whole
business around lead magnets on
Instagram specifically and he he said
very very clearly the percent percentage
opt-in rate to your lead magnet is
directly attributed to how valuable that
lead magnet is and I've done this on
Instagram right where I try to get my
Instagram followers to my free
newsletter that's my whole angle here
and so if I say I had a lead magnet that
was for the perfume vending machines one
of my lead magnets was hey hit the word
guide in the comments and I'll send you
all the resources on this perfume
vending machine and what I'm sending
them is like a YouTube video of a
webinar and Cy link it's not a lot right
I just want their email candidly
but then I had another lead magnet that

[26:00]
but then I had another lead magnet that
was my cold email guide and it took me
an hour to aggregate this I took and it
was all my content I took two
newsletters all about cold emailing I
took all of my tweets about cold
emailing I took Sam Thompson's tweet
about cold emailing I put all this stuff
together in a Google doc and I then I
didn't made a video about cold emailing
and then I put a lead magnet as like
comment guide for my cold emailing guide
and my optin rate was like significantly
higher because a cold email guide can
really help you make money like it's
very valuable whereas like a YouTube
video about a perfum vending machine is
like N I can I can Google that you know
I think what's interesting there are
some YouTube accounts and Instagram
accounts that are like just showing you
how to write good
prompts in chat GB I don't know if
you've seen some of these and like you
and I have a business that we invested
in and it started out as this we thought
let's use chat TBT throw a thin skin
over it and will help healthcare
companies essentially identify things
it's now morphed into a company that's
actually building code it's a proper

[27:00]
actually building code it's a proper
technology is quite thick now yeah the
scin is a very eque but there's a lot
that goes into prompt engineering is is
the point I was trying to make and that
you have to ask it the right question in
order to get the answer that you want
and these context Windows which are
essentially the space bar that you're
using to ask the question are very very
large now like you can fit books in
these context windows so essentially
you're asking the llm a question and
you're saying hey llm using all the
knowledge that you have I want you to
read this book use it as context and
give me an answer on the top three
things I should do in order to stand out
as an applicant to my university right
like that's how people are using it now
and so I think like you're saying for
these AI automation
businesses my prompt was probably even
too thin like it I probably could do a
lot better job of creating a prompt in
order to create the training materials
for these things but even just showing
how to do The Prompt would be an
interesting business in and of itself

[28:01]
interesting business in and of itself
yeah my one prompt hack which is just
the the best prompt ever when you don't
really know how to fine-tune it is just
ask chat GPT what to ask chat GPT here's
my problem here's what I want to ask you
I don't know how to ask it how should I
ask this to you it works for everything
give me an example okay let's say I want
to take a I did a webinar a couple
months ago for RV Park investing it was
an hour long I wanted to turn that that
into I don't even remember something
outline and I I took the the SRT file
which is like the captions file the the
text and I uploaded it and I was like
Hey make bullet points of this and it
did and I was like ah I don't like it
and I was like H it wasn't what I was
looking for so I was like hey here's
what I want to do here's my intent
here's the content what should I ask you
I don't remember what it told me exactly
but I ended up getting what I
wanted okay tell her what you're
thinking and then how to ask the
question to get what you want dude

[29:01]
question to get what you want dude
that's really interesting because I
think a lot of people it's funny how
like this conversation is moved I think
a lot of people still use chat TPT like
they use Google where's the best
restaurant in California and it's a hard
habit to break right yeah because it's
like this really short question but the
Magic in chat GPT is you can ask it
questions with context you can say like
hey I had this conversation with 75
investors most of them have a media net
worth of $5 million they're all looking
to put their money to work I am trying
to buy this park down the road it's $10
million I need like 15 of them to
convert but in order for them to feel
comfortable with converting like they
need to understand what the return on
investment is I don't really know what
the return on investment is yet like you
know what I mean so you say all of that
in the prompt because that gives it the
context necessary to then answer your
question which is what's the best way
for me to present this data to get 15 of
them to give me their money right and
that's the first question and then from
there you can iterate but ch GPT is not
one sentence like it's not optimized if

[30:01]
one sentence like it's not optimized if
you're just asking one sentence it's
like here's a paragraph of things that
you can use as context now help me
answer this question it's so funny
because I probably texted you this five
years ago I'm sure you forgot but Ariel
my sister-in-law listens to this podcast
she's wonderful and her husband Matt my
brother-in-law five years ago Ariel in
the the family group chat she sent a
screenshot of something that Matt had
Googled and left up on the computer
accidentally okay
and I still refer back to to this
screenshot because Matt was ahead of his
time for chat GPT like he's been asking
Google these type of questions forever
like he was ready for chat gbt so his
Google search was all caps I don't know
if Matt's like 88 years old I thought he
was about 34 it's all caps and this is
exactly what he asked Google I have thaw
chicken and I want to cook for my
wife that's it that was it that was the
question all cap I got to put it up in
the YouTube video it's saved in my

[31:00]
the YouTube video it's saved in my
Google a question it's not even a
question oh my God it's just a statement
Google's like Sergey Bren stepped out of
the computer he like bro what do you
want from me you're just too early on
this AI stuff no no Sam Alman was doing
quality assurance and he saw that and he
was like I think we need to build
something that can answer this guy on
our team we need this guy on our
team oh so good that is so freaking
funny while we brought Silicon Valley
into the discussion so I was just
listening to another podcast it was
similar to this I don't want to name it
I don't like calling people out I think
this is funny I'm not trying to make
anyone feel bad it's a podcast you you
might not be familiar with but it's a
pretty popular podcast okay they talk
about business ideas and so they had
this guy on and I don't want to call him
out he's very well known in Silicon
Valley he's a multi-billionaire he's
built some awesome companies like very
much richer than us okay very successful
respectable
but the podcast host asked this guy this

[32:01]
but the podcast host asked this guy this
billionaire give me your two best
business ideas and I was like oh okay
I'm sitting up in my chair I'm ready to
go okay okay this is gonna be good this
is a billionaire he probably has the
best ideas ever you see where I'm going
with this right I do yeah first idea I
see some Merit in it but he he was like
I can't stop thinking about this idea
this is going to change the world I just
like I I don't even want to talk about
it cuz someone is going to build this
and I'm going to have so much fun
this is the idea you ready yeah it's an
app that where like a scratch off
lottery jet M I understand playing on
the human emotion of liking to reveal
things right there's something innate
there so I get that he wanted there to
be an app with an ad like 20% off a
bottle of Coca-Cola at your local
Walmart an ad that you scratch off that
everyone in the world scratches off at
the same time each day and it's always
going to be an ad with a coupon and it
could be like a really good coupon or it
could be a bad coupon that was his idea

[33:01]
could be a bad coupon that was his idea
that's the idea spending time to reveal
an
ad that guy's so rich he has no people
around him that tell him he's an idiot
anymore and the host bless his heart was
like yeah okay huh okay I like this part
like he was doing his best oh my gosh
the next idea you ready yeah he goes I
love drawing in the shower like I love
I've got this glass door in my shower
and it steams up up and I just love like
writing a note to my wife in the Steam
and then cuz it goes away it's ephemeral
it's ephemeral it's temporary it's
transitory it comes and goes it's
fleeting like I thought right I'm
Hamming it up a little bit yeah he's
like there needs to be an iPad app and
it's called like steamy shower door
where you can just draw things on a
steamy shower door but then it's going
to be gone it's like Snapchat it's not
going to be around
forever someone need this needs to be a
thing someone needs to build this
interesting he's a billion
like these are novelty apps you know

[34:00]
like these are novelty apps you know
what I mean like these are like yeah the
podcast host related his first idea to
HQ trivia right which was a worldwide
phenomenon The Rock hosted it they gave
away a million dollars one day a live
trivia show at the same time every day
where millions of people would all
participate at the same time and he
related and I see that I get that like
it's feeling of community togetherness
you could win real money it's fun you
feel smart if you answer the questions
but I think that is so so far removed
than what his actual idea was and so
yeah that was his idea and so it just
made me grateful for this podcast that
we discuss real ideas that are actually
approachable that could make real money
yeah dude that's really funny yeah he
has I was like screaming at my airpods
like I is am I being trolled right now
this is crazy oh my
gosh yeah spoiler alert you were being
trolled you were being trolled that's I
was I'm sorry oh oh okay I had somebody
on my podast recently she grew what's

[35:00]
on my podast recently she grew what's
your podcast name oh Nicon omics sorry
oh shoot with a ni or oh it's niik
onomics cool nomics okay her name's
Katherine I had her on my podcast nomics
and she started an Ecommerce company and
the e-commerce company sold essentially
productivity tools journals checklists
those types of things she grows it it
does like at its height it was doing 8
and5 million dollars a year in revenue
and she sells it in 2021 to a brand new
private Equity Fund private Equity Fund
runs it for a little while like every
private Equity Fund they think they know
what they're doing and they're smarter
than everybody they like did away with
the core offerings they pivoted and in
2023 I think in the beginning of 2023
basically they called her oh no was the
end of 2022 they called her and we like
Hey we're shutting this down would you
like to buy it back and so she didn't
know at first and she's like you know
yeah I'll buy it back and she bought it
back for inventory basically she didn't
tell me the exact price but
you can imagine probably a couple
hundred thousand so she buys it back and

[36:02]
hundred thousand so she buys it back and
now it's wa yes what type of product
sorry what type of e-commerce product so
these were productivity tools so
journals checklists those types of
things the the company's called
bestself.co okay anyway so she she buys
it back and in buying it back she like
is now doing everything that she wishes
she would have done the first time right
it's like so she had like two years off
and during those two years she's
processing everything the company it
dropped from 8 and half million in
Revenue to five and it's currently doing
right around five but it's way more
profitable than when it was even at8 and
a half million dollar right and she's
like I'm not worried about growing like
crazy y y so it got me thinking because
I am
obsessed with buying a business a
distressed business either out of
bankruptcy or for like Pennies on the
dollar that everybody else has
overlooked and turning it around like we
hear stories about this all the time
right and I don't know why but I'm like
that would be so freaking cool to find a

[37:01]
that would be so freaking cool to find a
diamond in the rough it's just being
given away it's being spun out and so
this is one of those things where it's
like I'm raising my hand I don't know I
wanted to brainstorm with you like how
would we find a business like that how
would we go about
systematically
identifying business opportunities like
this we've brainstorm all before it's
like well we could go to Just private
Equity Funds and Venture Capital funds
like there are so many of them and who
do we reach out to and like it's anyways
that would be just really hard and and
of itself but I'm still just keep coming
back to being obsessed with this idea of
buying something for like Pennies on the
dollar I just thought of a funny analogy
so you know how to find someone we've
talked about this before but youve
forgotten so I'll remind you okay but
the funny analogy is there's like
something in every business owner wants
to do that right like anyone who started
or bought or sold a business has this
fantasy of doing exactly what you just
described myself included and it's kind
of like anyone that played Sports in

[38:00]
of like anyone that played Sports in
high school do you remember the movie in
Invincible it was about a 30-year-old
bartender and part-time teacher from
Philadelphia who became a walk-on player
for the Philadelphia
Eagles yeah yeah that's who played V
Vince pale it's it's like the same
fantasy it's like oh put me in coach oh
I could do it I could do it like the
Rudy it's like the Rudy fantasy right
yes it's just it's innate with every
entrepreneur so
you do it by doing Outreach to one to do
Outreach to 100 to reach out to people
that are like CPAs and tax prep guys and
say put me in touch with your ugliest
customer like just the hairiest book the
guy who's about to close his doors I'm
that guy's savior I want to talk to that
guy ah that is a freaking really good
idea and qualify it be like I don't want
the guy who's doing $100,000 a year in
Reven restaurant I don't want yep I want
the guy who's like two million a year in
Revenue they've had a track record of
success
but for whatever reason they've run into
TR to trouble I think and this triggered

[39:01]
TR to trouble I think and this triggered
another thing that we've talked about in
the past how many businesses close their
doors they're just like done they don't
sell they just like they literally close
their doors most of them but there is a
lot of asset value there not necessarily
like physical assets but like customer
lists is is something that I tweeted
about this like a month ago I know yeah
and it could be the same type of
Outreach right like CPAs hey I'm looking
for two profiles of businesses ones that
have closed in the last five years that
didn't
sell and or businesses that are like on
death door that really need a lot of
help that fit this profile because you
could probably go back to like they have
clients who have just shut their doors
and just reach out to them for something
nominal and be like hey do you what
happened to your customer list what are
you doing with that i' be willing to
assign some value to it oh my gosh yes
so first of all I did this Outreach to
CPAs a while ago I was testing something
and one of the responses I still
remember I was like hey do you have any
clients that are really struggling
they're about to close their business

[40:00]
they're about to close their business
and this one guy said of course not
because I'm their
CPA was funny like that that is such a
stupid response oh my go like you're in
charge of their business it was funny
though and the other thing I'm thinking
of is when I tweeted about this it was
because I was on Facebook Marketplace
and I saw someone saying like free wood
I'm a wood shop guy I like doing
woodworking so I was like oh okay and
then the description was like my dad is
has health issues so he has to close his
Cabinetry business C tree businesses can
be insanely profitable that is a very
Niche business that can scale to eight
figures and Beyond with like healthy 30%
margins I I maybe it was a $100,000
business maybe 100 million I have no
idea I never even responded to it but
imagine going in there and saying hey I
don't want your Pine or your Oak I want
your customer list well I don't really
have a customer list well like I okay
you don't have a mailchip account that's
fine but do you have customers yes I
want to know who they are Okay cool so
you buy that or maybe you just get it
for free and then you go find a more

[41:01]
for free and then you go find a more
sophisticated cabinet company because
you're not about to start a cabinet
business right you knock on the door
this is a very personalized sale and you
say hey this guy around town just closed
down I want to call his customers
representing your company right as if
I'm an employee and say Hey you were
John's vendor right yeah yeah maybe it's
a custom home builder well I'm at soand
so now we love your business he closed
down John closed down our prices are
actually better our customer service
better like our lead time is two weeks
instead of John's which was four weeks
and then you just take a Delta on
anything you close it's very high ticket
you take 10 20% on all the revenue you
bring in from these customers that were
just going to be thrown in the trash
okay I'm gonna take that level it up
back to our distribution conversation
nobody can bring an idea up without the
distribution this reminds me well like
because I'm sitting here thinking I'm
like how would you systematize that how
would you make that into something where
you're like constantly getting inbound
you don't have to necessarily do bunch
of outbound cold and it made me think of

[42:00]
of outbound cold and it made me think of
you've driven around your neighborhood
or or your city and you've seen those
yard signs We Buy Ugly homes You' seen
those MH it's like yeah but we're not
looking for the nice houses we want the
crappy houses whatever could you do
something like that to like play on that
to say like hey we buy bankrupt
businesses or like we buy I don't know
some play there that is just like
Evergreen that people ass is like oh hey
yeah we just shut down dad's business
you know what I just saw I just saw
these guys buy ugly businesses let's
reach out to them like anyways that is
there some funnel we could create for
that is my idea like really stupid and
you're laughing at it or do you have
like an idea that you're excited to
share you tell me Nick am I a fan of
taking proven and established marketing
channels and moving it to a different
industry do I even like that is that
good okay okay are the ugly bandit signs
I know that say We Buy Ugly Houses we've
seen those around for decades they're on
billboards there's a nationwide
franchise that does it it clearly works

[43:02]
franchise that does it it clearly works
okay let me ask you this question I'm
going to softball you here you ready yep
what percentage of people that drive by
those signs are the target market not
maybe are willing to sell their price
for the price that they're asking but
have an ugly house that they could sell
at the right price it's a good
psychological trick because many people
think that their house is ugly right
like one person's ugly house is some
else's Dre home that they're to move
into so I would guess that it's actually
probably closer to like 60% but if I if
you were asking me like what percentage
of the market is actually what I would
consider to be those ugly houses or
whatever yeah I'd probably say like 10
to 20% of the market but that's why I
like it because it's like a really cool
psychological trick so first of all I've
been in that game that's really what
those signs are are wholesalers they're
not end investors they're not even
flippers it's a guy that has no money
that wants to get a house under contract
and sell the contract to a flipper or an
investor okay okay so when I hear ugly

[44:00]
investor okay okay so when I hear ugly
house I picture of driving through a
neighborhood and seeing normal nice
houses and then the isore that's
overgrown that has boards on the windows
so I'm thinking the number is closer to
5 to 10 per. let's just say it's 10%
okay okay now that number is unknown
because we haven't really done the
research but the number of business
owners in America is 100% known there's
32 million business owners in America
and 330 million people in America
therefore 10% of not adults but 10% of
humans in America is a business owner so
call it 20% of adults right and so if
20% of adults own a business and we use
that term very Loosely most businesses
have no employees correct but they're a
business none nonetheless therefore if
you were to put out an ugly yard sign
for We Buy Ugly businesses your Market
is twice as big than the owner of an
ugly house why wouldn't it work

[45:00]
ugly house why wouldn't it work
businesses are changing hands at a high
clip right now people are retiring right
I mean the silver tsunami everybody is
going Gaga over yeah why wouldn't it
work well we'll have to see sounds like
a really good test dude and I think it
would actually be even
easier because you could Target specific
zip codes like we have all the
information on income for different zip
codes so like I I want want Target zip
codes I have
$75,000 earnings and above because those
I'm going to guess that those are the
ones that are business owners MH yeah i
d That's yeah that's interesting that's
a interesting way to think about it all
right I'm on name cheap right now
okay oh I found a new domain to buy ah
TW oh oh oh twist my arm oh twist my arm
I don't want to buy another domain oh I
guess I will if I have to we bu ugly
buses.com
[Laughter]
by the time this pod goes live I will be

[46:00]
by the time this pod goes live I will be
an owner of this domain name Nick this
is gonna so
like dang it I mistyped businesses and
the real one isn't available
D any it was taken seven years ago
anyway if this would work on a local
level okay like we will see at some
point a nationwide billion doll brand
with some sort of offer proposition Like
That We Buy Ugly business Just Like We
Buy Ugly Houses is a billion dollar
franchise that you can buy into today
yeah the question is what are you doing
with those leads right to your point If
We Buy Ugly Houses is wholesaling them
what are you doing with leads for
businesses for sale this could go back
like full circle to the very first
company we talked about with a
programmatic SEO where you're building a
brokerage and you're just selling those
leads off one by one so We Buy Ugly
Houses the actual franchise they are not
wholesaling them most of the Rinky Dink
bandit signs you see are from
wholesalers but if you see a billboard
or a TV ad that say we buy all the
houses those are flippers those are

[47:01]
houses those are flippers those are
local flippers that bought into a
franchise that provided the whole system
for them to flip houses so if this were
a nationwide franchise I could see it
just being like a decision tree if a
cabinet business then sell the list to a
competitor if a HVAC business with
Million Dollar Plus eida sell the lead
to a business broker for 25% of his
commission right yep makes sense this is
a good pod we're really smart and
talented Nick so good our wives should
love us this is why our wives love us
right that's what I meant to say let's
call it time of death all right this is
a good one all right okay that's it for
hul Bros we'll see you next week
