you could think I'm stupid and that's
fine but I have an idea that I think is
brilliant and that you will love so I
used to own an Airbnb and we all know
that Airbnb properties are extremely
saturated right now why because there
are too many of them and you have to
stand out long gone are the days when
you can just buy a house and throw it up
on Airbnb you got to have a ball pit in
the backyard or freaking tree house or
house shaped like a potato you've got to
stand out or you will not get booking so
here's my idea someone needs to buy a
normal old house but fill it full of
inflatable Only Furniture I know what
you're thinking oh if it pops people
will use it yet who cares guess what
every business has headache every
business has things to work around this
is just one of them if you put
Restoration Hardware Furniture in there
you run the risk of people ruining it
and so here's what we do we buy only
inflatable Furniture we fill it with
crazy things like goldfish fake money
stuff that gets people to post pictures
cuz that's the name of the game here you
want a product that will organically
spread like wildfire will it be easy to
damage inflatable Furniture of course
but that's because it's cheap it's easy
to replace you can keep a locked closet
full of spares follow me for more
business ideas like these
