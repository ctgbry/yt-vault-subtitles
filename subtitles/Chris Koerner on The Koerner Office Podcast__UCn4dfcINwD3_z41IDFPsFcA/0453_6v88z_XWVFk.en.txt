look at this freaking thing right here
this is a story here on the prominade in
Santa Monica that brings Tik Tok shop
viral items to the physical world it's
crazy cuz a few months ago I posted that
something like this needs to exist
basically a Brookstone for the next
generation and this is it you can handle
touch and feel these viral products in
real life they have these booths where
Tik Tock live sellers can present and
they have lighting and professional
equipment where they can sell their wees
here and you can tell this isn't a
sponsored video because honestly it's
not how I imagined it should be this
walkable outdoor shopping area is
bustling with activity tons of people in
this store is totally empty here's
exactly what I think it needs to be the
location is right but the concept is all
wrong in my opinion you don't need to be
selling live in this expensive retail
store you need to buy a bunch of viral
products from Tik Tok and have people
there to demonstrate them so people can
see how they work in real life and then
buy them right there on the spot it's an
Impulse spot don't try to reinvent the
market to be Innovative take the
Brookstone model pair It With viral tick
tokish products plus demonstrations and
a walkable outdoor shopping area and
you've got a winning model follow me for
more business ideas like this
