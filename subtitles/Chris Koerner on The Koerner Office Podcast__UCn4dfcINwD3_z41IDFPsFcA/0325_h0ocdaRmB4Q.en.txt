[00:00]
Well, uh, thank you for coming. Um, I'm
excited about this park. It's, you know,
once we got that park in Montana, we
were kind of on the lookout for a second
one. And then, funny story, I'm going to
go ahead and share my screen now.
Let's see.
Also, if you do have questions, just put
them in uh the chat
anytime and then I'll I'll catch up with
them. So, I tweeted this
um on June 27th
and not thinking anything of it. It was
just something to tweet that day and I I
ranked this park that we're talking
about as number four having no ties, no
connection to it. And then a couple
hours after this tweet, I got an email
from the owners of it. And these are
guys that I had I had spoken with on
Zoom before. We had emailed a few times
about other RV park stuff and they were
the owners of it. Um, so just kind of a
crazy coincidence that I knew nothing

[01:01]
crazy coincidence that I knew nothing
about this park when I tweeted about it
and then later that day, uh, we were
talking about buying it and now it's
under contract. So, according to Chris
Kerner, uh, it's the fourth most
beautiful park in the United States, but
uh, disclosure, I did not do very much
research for this tweet. I just wanted
to tweet something. So, it is a
beautiful park though, just kind of a
crazy coincidence. So, um I'm going to
start with the broker's uh deck that
they sent us originally because there's
a lot of good info in there that is not
in our deck. So,
this park is really unique for a couple
reasons. The the biggest reason it's
unique is that it is a KOA holiday. Now,
KOA has three tiers. They have resort
holiday and then I can't remember what
was the third one. uh journey holiday
and resort. So this is like middle of
the pack um KOA which is just it's based
on how many amenities they have and how

[02:01]
on how many amenities they have and how
expensive it is. Um so it's a really
really nice park. You've got mini golf
pool uh volleyball um cabins, tent
sites, pads, um expansion plans for 64
more pads. Um and of course you can see
beautiful Flathead Lake just right down
the road. Um so in going over this it
the the um sales price was 5.8. We
bought it for 5.5 uh which is almost a
10 cap. Um
9.5 5.8. So it's basically a 10 cap. uh
which is awesome, especially considering
the fact that it comes with 10 um
individually deed pads that we have the
right that will be uh transferred over
to us at close and that we have the
right to resell. Um, more specifically,
six of the 10, which are valued at about
$150,000 each, will be included in the
purchase price and transferred to us.
And four of the 10 are not included in

[03:00]
And four of the 10 are not included in
the purchase price, but we will have the
right to buy them for around $150,000
each after close should we want to. And
so, that little quirk about this park is
the main reason why the sellers and the
broker really kept this uh on the hush
hush. They were afraid that the HOA
committee um the people that has that
either own these 10 lots or that have
the right uh to buy them would like
pitch a fit um and try to uh vote
together. So they do require a 90% vote
to basically say no, you can't buy these
from us. Um which is it would be
extremely hard to do, but it would be
easier to do if they all knew that the
park was being sold. And so although
this is listed um with a broker, it was
not listed online. Um and they were very
very very adamant to me. Um do not tweet
about this. Do not talk about this. Um
there's really only downside. So this

[04:01]
there's really only downside. So this
when I upload the recording of this, it
will be marked as private on YouTube. Um
and I act I ask that you please try to
keep it um keep it private. Once we're
out of the due diligence due diligence
phase and our earnest money is hard, um
they don't mind as much uh that we talk
about it, but I still won't be tweeting
about it and we've been kind of asking
around talking to our investors and we
don't think we'll have problems raising
money for it anyway. So, there's there's
really not a need to tweet about it. So,
anyway, this is a park and I'm sure
you'll have questions about that. So, go
ahead and ask them in the chat and I
will I will get to them. Um, so swimming
pool, hot tub, pavilion, kitchen area,
dog run, basketball, volleyball courts,
Wi-Fi, laundry. It's got um a ton of
amenities. Um, and a lot of this I can
send this to you, by the way. I don't
think you have this, but I'm happy to
send it so you can read it. I just don't
want to waste time reading it verbatim.
Um, it is an interesting park because it
is it's not seasonal. It's um it's open
year round. So, it is seasonal in the

[05:01]
year round. So, it is seasonal in the
sense that the occupancy goes way down
in the wintertime, but unlike, you know,
Moose Creek, we close for six months a
year, whereas this is open all year. Um,
so it's kind of unique in that way. And
even though it's only an hour and a half
away from Glacier, um, the climate is
actually quite a bit different here.
It's a little more favor favorable to a
year- round park. So,
want to show you a couple quick drone
videos just so you can see. um what it
looks like.
Pollson is a really nice town. Um there
is an airport right there which we were
immediately worried about, but we went
through and read all the reviews and
there's no complaints about the airport.
It's really only small planes flying in
and a very low uh quantity of planes.
So, it's it's a non-issue from what we
understand.

[06:05]
[Music]
I assume you can still uh see my screen
here.
It's just very well-maintained. Um, of
course, if it is a KOA, then it it is
held to a certain standard, which helps
uh make things easier to maintain.
There's some accountability there. And
also, the KOA rights, uh, basically the
franchise licensing rights are expiring
in a year and a half, 2026. And so, we
will have the option, should we choose
to, uh, not pay them 6% of topline
revenue and just do our own thing. So,
not sure what we'll do because we do
like KOA, but it's it's widely dependent
on the location. Uh, certain parts of
the country, KOA doesn't have as strong
of a brand name or a reputation, but
they're still there. For instance, the
park in uh Shreveport that we just

[07:00]
park in uh Shreveport that we just
closed on. Um, it started as a KOA
because they have a six-month clause
where you can you can cancel if you
don't like it. He started as a KOA and
didn't really think that they were
bringing much business to him and so he
canceled and he he's done great ever
since. Um but then we have a couple
other parks that are KOAs that do really
well and we're able to attribute a lot
of bookings from them. Um
all right, so that's just quick drone
and picture. Um nightly rates are in
line with the area. Uh there is room to
increase them a little bit but not a
ton. Um occupancy ranges uh between you
know 30% in the wintertime to 100% in
peak summer. It's not 100% all the time
in the summer every year but it has been
increasing year over year over year. The
occupancy has been getting better. Um,
the reason that the seller is selling
this park is because they have a capital
partner that does not like the idea of

[08:03]
partner that does not like the idea of
having um individually deed parcels.
They've got a bunch of other parks in
their portfolio and none of them have
that except this one and so they're
trying to clean up their portfolio.
So there's just some pictures of it and
once again I will send this all to you.
Um
trying to see on this map where Moose
Creek is. Believe it's closer up there.
Um and then this is the expansion plan.
64 pads. Uh this is already been drawn
up. And what's really nice about this is
it's all city utilities. So we don't we
don't need to do much. It's going to be
a much more affordable per pad expansion
plan than what we're normally used to.
Um because water and sewer are city. So
we're just going to be able to plug
right into that. Um, we already have the
approvals and there are no tiny home
plans in this, but we will be adding um
some more cabins and tiny homes because

[09:00]
some more cabins and tiny homes because
we've been having a ton of success with
those at our other Montana park. So,
you're right down the road from the
lake. Uh there's room to there's a place
to paddle board. Uh, and there's
restaurants right down the road. Um,
just nice area and that's too hard to
see on a screen share so you can look at
that when we're done. Those are uh amps
for rent. See, we're right here at the
top. 87 to 119 a night. Um now this one,
the Pulson Motorcoach Resort, those are
the 10 pads that are on site. Okay, so
that that is not a competing part. We
are buying both of these. And the KOA is
basically the parent in this situation
with the rights over this one. Um so
those 10 pads are very, very nice.
They're well built out. Um and so they
command a lot more per night. Um
so yeah, according to this you're like
we're on the low end uh compared to the
10 pads that are right there on site and

[10:01]
10 pads that are right there on site and
we're on the higher end compared to
competing parks, but these are quite
these are quite a ways away.
12 to 25 miles.
And um the only other one on the lake
is Eagle's Nest right there.
Um
yeah, that's just area information. So
I'll send that out. And then if we go to
I want to go to Google Maps first. So
you can see here there's two Google Maps
listings. Uh the Motorcoach Resort uh
are the 10 pads 4.5 stars out of from 81
people. And then this one is the 51
pads. Uh 4.4 stars from 300 people. So
same business, two different Google Maps
listings. Um
that's what it looks like.
Believe the resort lots are right up
here in the front. They've got a better
view of the lake. Um they have more

[11:01]
view of the lake. Um they have more
amenities built up around them. Just a
better location altogether.
Then you've got the airport right there
and the lake just right down there.
Um, this is the website for the motor
coach resort. You can see it's not KOA
branded. Um, when you click to book,
it's just kind of a a janky contact us
form. And then this is the website for
the other pads.
KOA. So, moving over to the deck. Um
this is it. So we're raising 5.5 that
includes all the funds needed for the
expansion. Um 10% preferred return uh
aiming for 24.3%
irr um and 50% uh is the estimated bonus
depreciation
um that we plan to take uh in year 2024
because that will be dropping on January

[12:00]
because that will be dropping on January
1st. So trying to get that while we can.
Um,
that's just kind of a little explainer.
Um, a lot of this is repeated in the the
deck that I just showed you. Six resort
lots. Um, expansion plans, KOA agreement
expiring in February 2026. So, two,
yeah, let's see. Yeah. So, one and a
half years.
some more pictures, expansion plans
just outside of Callispel. Um, we so
we're keeping the management in place.
They are it's a really really strong
team, but normally if we were buying a
park that was not near another park, we
would need to add our additional
management in on top of that. But since
we have uh park an hour and a half away,
which I said in the email, that's the

[13:00]
which I said in the email, that's the
perfect distance for us. Um we won't
need to do that. So you'll usually see
on our pro performas that we take a year
one hit from adding in that management
oversight, uh which will not be the case
with this park.
Um I think a lot of you have been on
previous webinars before or seen them or
read the decks. Um, so I don't like I'm
not a big fan on really pushing like the
size of the industry or the industry
growth just because I feel like that's
that's what people do when they don't
have other things that are better more
specific to that asset class to talk
about. But of course, we are very
bullish on the RV sector in general.
People are going outside more and more.
Uh, the pendulum is is swinging more
away from screen time and more towards
um outdoor time. National and state park
attendance has been soaring. Um, and
we've got good experience in the space.
This will be park number 23. Um, and we
love the we love buying campgrounds that
are near um a a destination. Um, the

[14:02]
are near um a a destination. Um, the
plan A is always short-term rentals, you
know, for $50 to $150 per night. Plan B
is always long-term rentals. uh if or
when the economy dips, you can convert
the parks to be uh more a more stable
cash flowing asset that are less
profitable uh but less headache and more
stable. Um so most of our parks are in
the southeast. There's two in south
central um Oklahoma just north of me.
Those are managed by the same person and
then this will be the second in Montana.
Um we do have a strong track record with
our investors. Uh we've never missed an
LP payment. Um the the whole strategy
with all of our parks is to refinance in
two to three years. We've never done
that yet. Uh we haven't had a need to
with rates being where they are. We have
received um refinance term sheets from
banks that are someone's trying to join.
Um that are favorable that is just it

[15:01]
Um that are favorable that is just it
financially doesn't make sense for us to
refinance yet.
Was there a question?
Okay, never mind. Um so that that's the
whole strategy is to return LP capital
uh all or most of it within 3 years uh
but keep them in the deal and stay in
the deal for a total of 5 years um or
more. Um a lot of that depends on a
potential offer a potential exit but we
don't plan to sell off individual parks
peace meal because you capture more
value when you you keep it under the
same management umbrella.
Um,
okay. This is basically what I just
said. Uh, the other terms.
Can you use your ways for me?
I got it.
Okay. Would you mind muting your mic?
Is that Tom?
Hey, Tom.
Let me see if I can do that.
All right. Tom should be muted now. Um,

[16:00]
All right. Tom should be muted now. Um,
okay. So, these are the terms of the
deal. 10% preferred return, which if
you're new to LP investing, that means
that 100% of the return goes to you up
until 10%. Um, after 10%, um, it's split
7030 in favor of you. After 15% 6040,
and after 20%, uh, 50/50.
So
these are this is just a screenshot of
the um proformas which account for
uh the value ad that we're doing. Um so
at an exit cap rate of 8% uh we are
assuming here that this would be that we
would exit this park in tandem with
other parks which would drive the cap
rate down. We are buying it at a 10 cap
today. Um so this is what the returns
would look like uh at an exit cap rate
of 8% and if we in increase the cash

[17:00]
of 8% and if we in increase the cash
flow from I think it was about 500 last
year give or take um to these. So the 64
pads would be added in here and the tiny
home/c cabins. Um and we are expecting
the the expense ratio to drop over time
as we reach more economies of scale. But
43% on day one is is pretty good from
what we've seen from other parks.
This is what distributions would look
like if you invested a 100,000. It is a
minimum of 50,000 uh accredited only. Um
so you can see it it it jumps up quite a
bit there after we add the pad sites
and then uh return of capital in this
case would be in 2027 upon a refinance
or a sale or refinance in this case a
sale in this case.

[18:00]
Um yeah so that that is basically it.
I'm going to go to the chat to see if
there's any questions. I'm trying to see
if there's anything else I wanted to
share.
Yep, that's it. All right, let me stop
screen sharing.
All right, seven questions. Let's see.
So, all right, I got ahead of myself.
Let's start at the top.
Is this park actually on a reservation?
Google Maps seems to think it is on flat
reservation. I'm not sure, Jeff, but let
me let me find out.
I do know that we've looked at other
parks on reservations um and it's not
it's not the deal breaker that people
might think.

[19:02]
All right, I will send that out in an
email.
So, the upside downside of a KOA 6% fee
is the downside. Um, upside is
theoretically more visibility. Um, you
know, it's a it's a franchise, right?
And having the the the trust, the brand
name of a KOA behind you. A lot of
serial travelers prefer staying at KOAs.
That's where they go to first. Um, like
I said, the thesis is just it's spotty
depending on what part of the country
you're in and what park uh it is. So,
what do the improvements look like for
this park? It seems pretty stable with
higher rents. It's just building out the
expansion. Yes. Um, we don't plan to add
any more amenities. There's not really
much you could add. Uh, simply expanding
the park. Explain the motor coach sites
in the HOA issue. The deal is for 10 of
the 60 sites that are there and 100% of
the KOA sites,
only some of the motor coach sites. Will

[20:01]
only some of the motor coach sites. Will
you be a minority owner there? Um, I'm
not sure, Travis. I'm going to read that
again,
but yes, the deal is for 10 uh the the
10 motor coach sites. there's only 10 uh
and all of the KOA sites. Uh what's the
risk and only only some of the motor
coach sites? I I'll get more like I
tried to answer that question fully
before this call, but it's still not
clear to me personally. So, I'll try to
get more clarity on that. Um, I just
know that four are not transferring, six
are, and that we have the right to
purchase the four uh postclo um unless
they
uh have a supermajority vote against us,
which would be nine out of 10.
After the expansion, what's the expected
Let me write that down before I forget
to ask that answer that.

[21:01]
to ask that answer that.
after the expansion, what's the expected
slashestimated increase in revenue in
the first year? Um, so I might have
gotten to that after you asked the
question. Um,
but I'm going to go back to that page of
the deck.
So, the increase of topline revenue
after the expansion would be about
$500,000.
Um
and bottom line that would at the same
expense ratio or at a similar expense
ratio uh it would be an increase of
400,000
little under 400,000.
And so if I break that down, let me just
break that down real quick. So if we're
at $100 per night, um 700. All right. So
$500,000.
Give me just a second.

[22:07]
So that's an extra on a yearly basis
that's an extra $1,300 per night. Um so
basically we're assuming 13 at $100 per
night we're assuming 13 out of 64
occupancy on a year- round basis. Um, so
what's that 20%
20% yearly occupancy assumption on the
first year on the additional pads only.
Um, and they're probably baking in some
occupancy growth on the the existing
pad. So, it's probably a little less
than that, maybe 18%. Um, it's probably
going to be closer to 5 to 10% in the
winter time um and 30 to 40 50% in the
summertime. So, fairly conservative. And
then that's the first year. And then it
goes up 450,000 after that. And then it

[23:00]
goes up 450,000 after that. And then it
it starts to stabilize
uh goes up another 70,000 and then
another uh 70,000 per year after that.
So basically big bumps on year 1 and
year two and then more stable occupancy
growth in in years uh three and four. Uh
more similar to what we've been seeing
over the last three or four years.
Closing
is late October, early November, I
believe. Um, we've got some time on
this. Um, it's uh Q4 close. Minimum is
50K. How many expansions have you guys
successfully completed to date? Any
unexpected challenges slashtaking longer
than expected?
We have done
see
Newport I believe five expansions with
like another
12 in the pipeline underway right now.
And it depends on if you're counting
like adding more units to existing pad

[24:02]
like adding more units to existing pad
sites or actually adding new pad sites.
Um I believe five, but I'm going to get
an exact number for you. Uh, and to
answer the second part of your question,
let me get to that in a sec.
Um, yes, there are always uh unforeseen
uh delays and difficulties, but our
expansion guy Joe Dykus is super super
competent, super good. He works a ton.
He's been in land development for 30
years. Um, he spent time living in RV
parks and developing RV parks. RV parks.
uh they're all he knows. So, he's he's
super good. Um we did have an issue with
our second park ever in the expansion
side of it uh because the electrical was
under capacity and so we had to spend 20
or 30 grand to fix that and now we we do
a lot more thorough electrical
inspections. Um, so

[25:02]
inspections. Um, so
you know, developing and expanding is
always tricky, but we're confident uh
with the system that we built so far.
Are you able to use the same contractors
as Moose Creek? How is the Moose Creek
expansion going? The answer is yes, we
will be using the same contractors and
the expansion is it might be the best
expansion we've done so far. We didn't
plan to do anything this year. Uh you
can go back and look at my webinar and
we said you know we don't want to do
anything this year because it is a
seasonal park so we don't want to rock
the boat too much. We were going to add
the ever rooms um which are like a tiny
home luxury concept. They're $150,000
each but we found a cheaper concept and
we actually bought more of the exact
same uh cabins that they already had on
site. They were 50 grand and we added
two in like the first four months and
they are crushing it. And then we bought
the land next door that came with two
Airbnbs. We closed on that. Those are
being rented out the majority of the

[26:00]
being rented out the majority of the
time. Um, and then we've added primitive
campsites and we're in the process of um
adding more pad sites to the land that
we got next door. Um, but that's still
very early on. So, uh, it's ahead of
schedule, but we also haven't done a lot
of the extra hard stuff yet. So,
uh, Lane, the deck, I sent the deck out
in the email. I linked to it. Um, but
I'm going to link to it again in the
follow-up email. And also, the deck I
sent out was outdated. Uh, I need to
update that. You show the proform again.
Looked like you were modeling very large
year-over-year gains in net income.
Curious what is driving those? So, I
think you answered that right before I
talked about that. Um, let me go ahead
and show it again.
See,

[27:05]
hold on.
I think I'm doing this right.
So, yes, the year-over-year gains are
large. uh after we add those pad sites
um and then they stabilize after that.
All right.
Just want to get a good look at that. Um
I'll just keep answering questions while
I leave that on the screen. Are you
personally investing in this deal as an
LP and if so, how much? Yes, Trip. Uh I
am. We invest 10% uh as co-GPS into
every deal. That varies how much we each
invest depending on how much we like the
deal. Um how much money we have at any
given time. Um so I'm not sure how much
I will be investing, but it will be five
figures. Um not six, maybe 20 or 50

[28:02]
figures. Um not six, maybe 20 or 50
grand somewhere in there. Um it also
depends on what my partners are
investing. Uh because yeah, 10% is only
so much.
Um, when we invest as COGPS, it is at
the LP terms.
Um, I skipped a question. Does KOA have
to approve any expansion plans? Yes, and
they have already approved these
expansion plans because they're already
drawn up. Um,
okay. Uh, I think I've got everything.
Do we have any other questions
before I end this? I'm happy to ask or
answer and you're welcome to take
yourself off mute now that I'm I'm done.
We could do that as well.
So, as I said before, we're not closing
for a while. There's not really a sense
of urgency on this, but um John told me
that we do have one of our big Moose

[29:00]
that we do have one of our big Moose
Creek investors that might want to take
a big chunk of this. So, it really just
depends on what other investors do. Um,
but there's outside of that, outside of
it just filling early, we're not closing
for a while. So, this could be the time
on this. That's probably not a very good
sales pitch. Should tell you that we're
almost full. We're 95% of the way there,
but nope. Um, any questions? Looks like
there's one more. Estimated expansion
cost. It is, I believe, 12,000 per pad.
So,
uh 770,000. I I could be wrong there,
but it's directionally accurate. Um
often times we see twice that or more
when we have to add septic, sewer, uh
water, electrical, all that. We do have
to add electrical here, but that's the
big expense.
And if I'm wrong about that, I will send
a a correction. And I asked Jod D that

[30:00]
a a correction. And I asked Jod D that
exact question before we hopped on this,
but he has not responded yet. try to get
ahead of that one.
Um, all right. Any other questions?
How confident are you that there is
increased demand at Flathead Lake?
That's a good question. It's interesting
because, you know, you might look at
this logically at any park and say,
"Well, why would you ever expand a park
that is not 100% full all the time?" And
what we've noticed with our previous
parks is it's kind of like a Parkinson's
law. Uh when you have when you add more
pad sites, you're able to bring the
price down on all of the pad sites. And
it you you almost always, unless you
don't meet your performance, net out
ahead. And so because of the fact that
there are only six cabins here and the
cabins at our park an hour and a half
away are doing the best, um we see a lot
of upside with adding cabins instead of
just 64 uh ads like the original owners

[31:03]
just 64 uh ads like the original owners
have drawn up. So we see more upside
there because the cabins are staying
full and we're seeing that to be true at
Moose Creek as well. Um, furthermore, it
will give us room to drop the rents um
and increase the occupancy percentage at
a a slightly lesser rent as well. So,
outside of that, um, we have done our
due diligence in calling the parks in
the area. A lot of them are full um,
with a waiting list. Um, but at at the
end of the day, anytime you expand a
park, there's going to be there's going
to be the risk of occupancy not being
what you had expected. But these park
owners haven't really been marketing it
much. Um they're not doing paid ads. Uh
they're relying on KOA. And so we're
confident that when we pull the levers
that we normally pull after closing,
we'll further be able to increase
occupancy, especially once those
additional pad sites are added.
Um
there's currently a management team in
place. How many employees do they have

[32:00]
place. How many employees do they have
and how many do you expect to add on
after the expansion? So all of these
parks are managed by Bluemetric. Um, and
Blue Metric has in Nashville 30 to 40
employees. Um, but we're we don't plan
to add any additional employees at the
park level for this park. We just plan
to keep everyone that's there. Uh, and
then our our Moose Creek manager to to
double up on this one.
Let me go look at real quick to answer
that question more fully.
So, it looks like 28 employees.
Um, do you need additional approval
since original expansion plans were for
pads and now you want to do more cabins?
That's a good question. I'm going to ask
that. I'm going to write that down.

Black Lake and Glacier Park. Yes, we
love the area as well. Uh we went to
Glacier as a family a couple years ago
and it was a highlight of our trip,
which is saying a lot because we went to
all 50 states that summer and Glacier
and Tahoe and Arches and Zans, those are
all top five for us. We love the West.
Um,
okay. So, the questions I have to get
back to you on are, is this on a
reservation? More clarity on the 10
sites? How many expansions exactly have
we done so far? And do we need
additional approval for cabins since
only pads are planned right now? Um,
okay. Well, thank you all. If we don't
have any other questions, I will send
out this recording and um I will I'll
get the answers to this question to
these questions as soon as I can. Um,
