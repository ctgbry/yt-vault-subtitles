okay look at this freaking thing right
here this video reminded me of one of
the most brilliant business ideas I've
heard all year day 22 of Genius business
ideas follow for more so my friend Kyler
worked for a guy that had a little Shack
set up outside of a cement plant a Ready
Mixed cement plant and when those big
cement trucks come back from a job they
usually overbid the job they bring more
cement than they need so they don't run
out which means they have to come back
with extra cement and they got to do
something with it or it's going to dry
up and ruin their truck so normally at
these plants they just dump it out into
a pile and they crush it up and sell it
as recycled cont but what my friends
boss did was genius he built about 90
forms that look like these here's a
Google Earth screenshot of the exact
forms I'm referring to and the cement
trucks would dump out their waist in
these forms for free and he would turn
them into these cement retaining blocks
that you're seeing right here and here's
an actual screenshot of him actually
selling these for $90 in Utah this is a
multi-million dollar business their cost
of goods sold is close to zero and he's
been running it for over a decade I did
some research and only 30 to
40% of Ready Mix factories offer this
right off to the side which means 7 to
