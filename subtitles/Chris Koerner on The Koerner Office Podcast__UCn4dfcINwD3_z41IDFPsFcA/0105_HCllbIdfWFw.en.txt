so I'm here in Athens right now that's
Greece not Georgia look at that church
it's like a 200-year old church and it
is not surprising that the economy here
is failing first of all here at this old
church there's like thousands of people
coming through here a day and there's no
Chipotle like you could easily put a
Chipotle like by that entrance or a
Starbucks over by that entrance and they
would kill it start to tax that and you
can fix these roads and churches in no
time follow me for more American advice
like this
