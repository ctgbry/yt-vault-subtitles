2024 was the most transformative year of
my life here are my five tips to make
2025 your most transformative year
number five stop caring what other
people think about you you just have to
stop there's no other way around it I
hesitated posting these cringy short
form videos for years because I cared
what people thought once I stopped
caring and I flipped the switch I went
from 60,000 to 1.3 million followers in
6 months number four we underestimate
what we can accomplish in a decade and
we overestimate what we can accomplish
in one year so zoom out a little bit be
a little more patient and take time to
get where you want to go number three
sell it before you have it start before
you're ready the conditions will never
be perfect so stop waiting for that to
happen number two find the thing that is
wor but does not feel like wor and then
find out how to make money on it that is
the most important thing you can do in
your professional life number one say
yes to everything everything overburden
yourself with tasks and be amazed at how
much you get done focus on nothing Chase
all the rabbits all the shiny objects
