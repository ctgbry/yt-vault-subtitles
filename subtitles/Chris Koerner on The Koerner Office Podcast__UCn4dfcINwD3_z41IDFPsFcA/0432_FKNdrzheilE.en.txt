look at this freaking thing right here
this guy makes crazy funky Harry Potter
likee dressers and furniture that seem
magical with embedded sensors and you
won't believe how much he sells them for
but before I give you the answer here's
how and why you should copy businesses
like this did you know that 53% of
Americans identify as Harry Potter fans
and a similar amount identifies as Lord
of the Rings fans you take that number
worldwide there are over 1 billion with
a be Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings
nerds I mean fans now how much does
someone in the 1% income bracket make in
America on average they make $820,000
per year okay so how do you profit let's
take a billion people and take the top
1% of them but we'll drop the number
because if worldwide it's not going to
be 820 Grand let's say it's $ 400 Grand
that's 10 million Harry Potter nerd that
can afford to buy outrageous things like
this that Disney or JK Rowling or
whoever owns those rights would never
think of selling because it's too Niche
but there are riches in the niches my
friend or riches in the niches as the
French might say so this dresser here is
$220,000 and they are sold out all the
time so go find your nerdy things and
profit full business plan here
