what did I even just read is this guy
for real first of all if crushing
concrete were this easy and profitable
then why do concrete demolition
companies give it away instead of just
crushing it and turning it into free
money it's as if his business plan is go
buy money tree seeds plant money trees
and then pick the money when it grows
off the tree and use that money to buy
things with your money it's like bro
first of all crushed concrete sells for
$20 a yard not $60 a yard second of all
a yard of crushed conc concrete is a
whole pickup truck's worth so you're
going to make $20 for crushing a pickup
trucks worth of concrete what a terrible
business model are you a caveman
