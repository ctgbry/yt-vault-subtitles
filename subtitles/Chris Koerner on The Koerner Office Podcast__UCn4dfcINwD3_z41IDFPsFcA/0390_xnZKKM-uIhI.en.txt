look at this freaking thing right here
it's a meat vending machine here's
exactly why this business would work and
how I would copy it so I used to have a
business called quarter cows and we ship
grass-fed beef to people across the
country and it is an amazing business
but here's the problem with the food
business it's cut into thirds onethird
of your cost is overhead or payroll one
third of the cost is the food and then
with that last third you're hoping to
make a 10% profit when all your other
costs come out of it what happens if you
took out one of those thirds
specifically the payroll SL overhead in
this case you bought a $3,000 vending
machine you have no employees and you
just set this up at an outdoor shopping
area and then you Source the meat from
local farms or vendors you would be so
much more profitable than a freaking
butcher shop and it'd be easier you
could Source everything from one to two
suppliers store it in a freezer and
refill the sucker every week I made the
full business plan for it right here for
free
