So, there's this floating golf green in
New Zealand that pays out $10,000 if you
get a hole-in-one. And it's a business
that prints money that I cannot get out
of my head. So, I'm here at Clyde Warren
Park in downtown Dallas. And I thought,
if this place in New Zealand can pay out
$10,000 for a hole-in-one on a floating
golf green and make $500,000 a year of
net profit, then how can I replicate
that in a popular park with a disc golf
disc [music] of all things? So, I'm
going to charge people $10 for three
chances to shoot this disc golf into
that disc golf basket from 65 ft. And if
they get it, guess what? I'm going to
give them a,000 bucks. IF THEY DON'T,
[screaming] I'M going to make 100%
profit. So, let's go.
All right. So, we got to buy some disc
golf discs. You'd think it'd be right
here, right? Flying disc.
Yeah. Well, it's not really. It's like a
kid's toy. [music] It's not very popular
here. We're in trouble. Got to do this
disc golf competition and we forgot. I

[01:00]
disc golf competition and we forgot. I
had [music] seven discs at home. I
forgot all of them. And now we're at
Walmart and they don't sell them. They
sell normal frisbees, [music] but we're
not doing that. That's too easy. All
right, guys. We're kind of in trouble
here. Walmart did not have the discs we
needed. But thankfully, I had an idea.
&gt;&gt; All right, it looks like right around
the corner. We've got an academy and a
Dicks. So, if they don't have discs,
[music] then we're in trouble. Discs.
Oh, you
&gt;&gt; you can just point the way.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Well, I'm grateful then. You are
the best. Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Dicks had exactly what we were looking
for, but there were a ton to choose
[music] from, so we had to make sure
that we bought the right ones so that
this challenge wouldn't be too easy.
&gt;&gt; These numbers mean something. 136 -2 $12
mid-range,
$25 [music] putter, driver mid-range.
That way, people don't have to use a
putter on [music] a three shot throw.
And if they really want to, they can use
the same for every time and we'll just
go fetch them for them.
&gt;&gt; You too.
&gt;&gt; With the discs secured, we made our
signs on the way to the facility

[02:00]
signs on the way to the facility
advertising a $1,000 cash [music] reward
for our disc golf challenge. So now, as
we head back to Clyde Warren Park, we
are almost ready to acquire some
customers. All right, we're not quite
sure how many feet this needs to be for
it to be barely attainable, somewhat
realistic, but still challenging for
people. is 40 feet 50 60. So you're at
64. This is kind of a perfect setup
though, isn't it?
&gt;&gt; We were finally set up here and we were
trying [music] to see if anyone had any
interest in participating in this
challenge, but unfortunately we ran into
some more trouble.
&gt;&gt; Just like a YouTube challenge.
&gt;&gt; Like a YouTube challenge.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; We're just having fun
&gt;&gt; to make money, right?
&gt;&gt; Well, it's 10 bucks to shoot three
shots.
&gt;&gt; So it's 10 bucks to shoot
&gt;&gt; Yeah. to shoot three shots. Yeah. No
property.
&gt;&gt; Can we do it for free?
&gt;&gt; No, you can do it for free, but you
can't get the money out.
&gt;&gt; That's what I'm saying. If we if we
don't do that,
&gt;&gt; okay, you have my word. We will not
charge money.
&gt;&gt; Yes, this was a setback, but we were
still able to use the data that we

[03:01]
still able to use the data that we
acquired.
&gt;&gt; Even if we don't charge though, we still
get a gauge for how much we could make,
right?
&gt;&gt; And thankfully, we had our first
challenger.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. 1,000 bucks right here. One throw
for five bucks. Three throws for 10. But
he says we can't charge. So that means I
want to put a little further back. You
have nothing to lose. All right. Totally
free.
&gt;&gt; You got three shots.
&gt;&gt; We just want to know the percentage
likelihood of the average person making
it. So this is 65 ft technique. Have you
ever played like disc golf?
&gt;&gt; Never.
&gt;&gt; I mean, you can throw it like a normal
Frisbee, but really the best way is to
like you put your two fingers in here
and you just kind of sling it like like
that.
&gt;&gt; And yes, of course, security returned
again. And this is proving to be a bit
more difficult than we thought it'd be.
&gt;&gt; Are we not allowed to have the signs up?
&gt;&gt; Really? Okay.
All right.
Woo.

[04:05]
&gt;&gt; You just need to be, I guess, in a place
where you can do it.
&gt;&gt; That'll be the hard part. But you want a
place that's you got a lot of foot
traffic and stuff. So
&gt;&gt; yeah,
&gt;&gt; that's why he's tough to tell us.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Well, good luck.
&gt;&gt; Cool. Thanks, man.
&gt;&gt; All right. So, they tried to kick us
out. They don't want us accepting money
or paying out money. But he said that as
long as we're not within the confines of
Clyde Warren Park. If we stand out there
on the road and hold this sign up, then
we can both give away and charge money.
So, let's go see what we can wrangle in.
Do you have any interest in throwing a
Frisbee to win a,000 bucks?
All right. We thought we'd walk around
and check the surrounding streets to see
if we could recruit anyone to
participate in this challenge with us.
&gt;&gt; Guys, we [music] have been moved to the
street. There's not a lot of people on
the sidewalk. Our security guys coming
back over. Not going well.
&gt;&gt; Okay, what did we learn? What was our
revenue? $0. [music] Our profit margin
was also $0 because we didn't have to
pay anything out. So, Clyde Warren Park

[05:01]
pay anything out. So, Clyde Warren Park
is not very disc golf challenge
friendly. [music] They don't want us
charging. They don't want us giving away
free money. He asked, I quote, "Is this
going to go viral?" Bro, I wish. I don't
know. Nobody knows. So, I don't think
this is a total failure. [music] We
learned that 65 feet is probably too
close to be giving away $1,000 for only
a $10 entry. We [music] probably need to
be more like 75 or 90 ft because we're
going to get pool sharkked by a hipster
millennial with a mustache and a flannel
shirt that plays disc golf for 20 hours
a week like my brother-in-law Justin.
[music] So, not a total failure. We had
a lot of fun. We didn't make any money,
but we learned something about data
[music] points and statistics. So, we're
going to pack up all our stuff and go to
Celebration Park up in Allen. We're not
just here for the charity. We want to
make some money. Instead of just calling
it a day, we came up with a new idea.
Obviously, most of these people didn't
even know what disc golf was. So, we
pulled up Google Maps and we found a
disc golf store in Arlington, Texas, 30
minutes away. We felt pretty confident
that here we'd be able to find some disc
golf players that would, yes, be more
experienced, more likely to make a

[06:00]
experienced, more likely to make a
hole-in-one, but also more likely to try
it. That's a trade-off that we were
willing to make. Okay, so we went to
Clyde Warren Park. We had it at 65 ft.
Most people had never heard of what disc
golf is. That just didn't work. So, we
are here at DFW Disc Golf in Arlington,
Texas. David is the owner. He was so
kind to give us the opportunity or give
his customers an opportunity to make an
ace, a hole-in-one from 95 ft. 95 ft
from right here to the disc up there.
It's going to be $10 for one throw or
$20 for three throws and we're going to
donate 100% of the proceeds to David's
nonprofit. David, could you tell us
about the nonprofit? My nonprofit is
called name HDNP International is since
2012 we start more than 18,000 homeless
people feed so far more than 6500
sleeping bag we give Christmas gift for
the homeless people our mission is very
simple who we are what we can give back
to the community and I'm so grateful to
my discount community always they

[07:01]
my discount community always they
support no matter what why we doing I
want to show you you all of you guys.
Might you do the same thing what we do
further back to the community? That is
all about HDNB.
&gt;&gt; Okay. It's beautiful. Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
&gt;&gt; So, this is Forest Ivy here. Where are
you from?
&gt;&gt; Arlington. Right here in town. And what
are you throwing today and why?
&gt;&gt; I'm throwing a Prodigy A2. It is an
approach disc. It's kind of like between
a putter and a mid. I forehand this and
it's just my go-to forehand shot for
this distance.
&gt;&gt; Okay. And you throwing once or three
times?
&gt;&gt; I'm going to throw three times. So, I
only have two discs, but uh I'm
definitely throwing three times.
&gt;&gt; All right,
&gt;&gt; 20 bucks. We got revenue. We're We're
cash flow positive so far. About to be
very cash flow negative.
&gt;&gt; Oh,
this is going to be bad. First throw of
the day was about
6 in from the basket. That was close,
Forest.

[08:00]
Forest.
&gt;&gt; Oh, man. You're scaring me.
&gt;&gt; Here goes Forest. Oh, throw number
three.
And I think we're safe. All right, 20
bucks in the bank.
&gt;&gt; Hey, my name is Barry Sailing and today
I'm going to throw a couple of judges.
That's my throwing putter and my putter
putter, but it's a little windy, so I
picked out a makeo too just to handle a
little more wind and we'll see what
happens.
&gt;&gt; All right, we got another guy here.
&gt;&gt; Would that count? That'd be awesome.
&gt;&gt; Wow. My gosh.
&gt;&gt; Pole assisted.
Oh,
&gt;&gt; that is a little far.
&gt;&gt; Oh, that was a little high.
&gt;&gt; My name is Matt Harris. I'm from
Arlington, Texas. First disc I'm
throwing is a MVP spin. Um, it's a
putter. The [music] uh next one is a
Proxy. It's also a putter. And then one
new one that I just got a hold of just
for for grins is an orbital. It's a
distance driver, but I'm going to try

[09:00]
distance driver, but I'm going to try
for it with that one also.
Oh,
&gt;&gt; Got it. Got it.
&gt;&gt; These are getting close.
&gt;&gt; All right. 60 bucks of revenue.
&gt;&gt; My name is Tristan Purleum. I've been
playing for like five weeks. And what
I'm throwing is a Dino Disc Triceratops.
&gt;&gt; Dino Disc Triceratops. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; All right.
&gt;&gt; Go ahead.
&gt;&gt; All right. Little short. Little short.
That's okay.
&gt;&gt; Blake Pum from Arlington, Texas. I've
been playing for maybe 5 weeks or so.
And I'm throwing an Inva Avatar putter.
&gt;&gt; So, one round, right? Okay. Now, I'm
going to throw it. Thank you so much. I
think Forest almost make it for 95 ft.

[10:00]
think Forest almost make it for 95 ft.
But go on the right because of the wind.
Also, I'm going to try myself. Let's see
what happened.
&gt;&gt; All right. This is the owner of DFW Disc
Golf. His name's David. He's got to be a
pro. He's got to be an expert. I have
very high hopes for him or low hopes
depending on how you look at it cuz I
don't want to lose a bunch of money. But
let's see what he's got.
Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Revenue at so far. How many shots have
there been?
&gt;&gt; I put $100 so far.
&gt;&gt; $100 bucks. All right.
&gt;&gt; $100 so far.
&gt;&gt; It's a lot. It's pretty close for only
being 10% of the way to break even.
Yeah. After this next round, we'll keep
going, but I'll pay all the the entry
fees to your nonprofit.
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
&gt;&gt; So, we'll still keep track of it all,
but you guys don't have to pay anymore.
Does that make sense?
&gt;&gt; Wow. Braden, my videographer, had the
genius idea to move the throw line up
and then push the basket back because we
were having all kinds of traffic issues
in this parking lot. We were having to
wait for cars. So now we won't have to

[11:01]
wait for cars. So now we won't have to
wait for cars anymore and it's still 95
ft. So we can keep rolling.
Hiding behind a sign here.
&gt;&gt; Too low.
&gt;&gt; Little low.
&gt;&gt; That's all right. Right on line.
Oh, too low again. Oh, that was the
hype. That was the hype. Hit the bush.
That gap is fun. I'm going to switch it
up and go with this Envy right out of
the gate.
&gt;&gt; All right, we're going to do it right
here.
Oh, that was close.
&gt;&gt; That was the line, baby.
Keep thinking I got the line and it
leaves my hand.
High low.
&gt;&gt; I'm curious as to everyone's like skill
levels. Who's like a who's a beginner?
Who's an expert?
&gt;&gt; We're both very beginner.
&gt;&gt; Very beginners.
&gt;&gt; Kind of moderate.

[12:00]
&gt;&gt; Kind of moderate.
&gt;&gt; Moderate.
&gt;&gt; Up there.
&gt;&gt; You're up there.
&gt;&gt; We play a lot.
&gt;&gt; Okay. What What is like the scoring
system?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a rating.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You play tournaments, sanctioned
tournaments, there's ratings.
&gt;&gt; And you guys play tournaments?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Okay. All right. Good to know.
130 150 160
&gt;&gt; 160 right all together.
&gt;&gt; That's it. It's all I got. Let's just
throw them all on the house now. I'll
donate and we can just throw as many as
we want. We'll just keep track.
All right. Nice Tristan.
A little too wide.
Oh,
okay. This is getting ridiculous. We
should have hit this by now. So, let's
get this over with. Send these boys
home.

[13:02]
Ah, look out.
Ah, that's terrible.
Oh, [laughter]
in and out.
Oh, man.
&gt;&gt; It's still It's still a,000 bucks to the
winner.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Awesome. No, it's way too low.
[music] Way too low.
Get it. Oh, right over the top.
do something that's going to make me get
out of my normal stuff.
That's too stable.
This one's it. Ah.
Oh,
no. Sorry, bro.

[14:00]
no. Sorry, bro.
&gt;&gt; Playing catch with Chris. That's all
we're doing.
&gt;&gt; That's right. Okay. That's how I tell my
son to make these long shots is to
pretend he's playing catch like I'm
behind the basket. We actually have
someone [music] behind the basket. This
should work, right? Be it. Be it.
&gt;&gt; Ah, that's the line though. That's the
line.
&gt;&gt; So, how many rounds is that? Nine. Nine
full rounds. You're the banker, right?
Are we at break even? What's our P&L
look like here?
&gt;&gt; A few moments later.
[screaming]
Yes.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Awesome driver. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; Good job, man. You crushed it, man. We
did it. How many shots was that? 180
shots. Oh, man. It feel good.
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
&gt;&gt; Good.
&gt;&gt; Considering it's a brand new disc.
&gt;&gt; Oh, heck yeah. That was awesome.
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Finally.
&gt;&gt; All right. thousand bucks to Matt
Harris, winner of the HDNP International

[15:02]
Harris, winner of the HDNP International
&gt;&gt; and DFW Discol Center.
&gt;&gt; That's right. Uh prize, only one Ace
Disc Golf. Well, how much do I owe you?
780. All right. How many [music]
sleeping bags is that?
&gt;&gt; Wow, this is a lot.
&gt;&gt; So, you got um 70 sleeping bag.
&gt;&gt; That's awesome.
&gt;&gt; We like to say thank you to supporting.
Thank you so much, Chris. Baseball. See
you later.
&gt;&gt; All right. It's good meeting you. Well,
thank you, Matt. Have a good trip. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Why I start this mission? I I came this
country 37 years ago in Nepal.
&gt;&gt; Wow. [music]
&gt;&gt; As a student, parents is very poor.
Sometime we have all starving something.
It's a lot of problem. 8 7 years old
little boy and thinking one day when I
grow up I want to do something for
other. I came struggle I start this
mission 2012 and we help the homeless.
We do the lot of work in right here here
as well as 10% we do the Ghana Africa
and also I do in Nepal all the culver

[16:01]
and also I do in Nepal all the culver
asks anywhere in salt lake city they
knows me anywhere in Sabana Georgia I
have a customer here people coming after
20 years and they open the door hi my
brother David they hug me I really
appreciate thank you Chris I mean God is
great but thank you so much
&gt;&gt; of course thank you for having us
&gt;&gt; thank you
&gt;&gt; well that was was an experience. We
basically went through the whole range
of disc golfers with this experiment. We
had people that had never seen a disc
golf basket before and then we had pros,
literal pros, and one of them ended up
winning $1,000. But is this business
viable? Absolutely. You need more
research. You got to learn. You've got
to learn at what skill level, at what
distance it's viable, [music] and at
what price point. There's about three
different variables here. So, I think
that a good price for this is going to
be like five bucks for one throw or 10
bucks for three throws at plenty of
enough distance with someone that is at
least somewhat proficient at disc golf
because people are much more likely to
know how to swing a golf club than how

[17:01]
know how to swing a golf club than how
to throw a disc golf disc cuz it's not
just a normal frisbee. It's something
specialized. So, I think the way to do
this business is to partner with disc
golf tournaments, disc golf shops, disc
golf enthusiasts, disc golf apps,
companies, etc. setup shop at one of the
tournaments where there are hundreds or
thousands of players and it can be kind
of like a sideeshow, like a side game or
a carnival, and you charge a money to to
try to get an ace, a hole-in-one. You
can do a pull-up challenge. How long can
you hold on to a bar? How many pull-ups
can you do? A hole in one golf
challenge, um throw a football through a
ring, shoot a basketball from half
court. The these are games of skill. You
just need to learn what the statistical
probability is of people at varying
skill levels. Once you know that, then
you can attach a price point to it so
you know what to charge. People go to
the casino and they win sometimes, but
the house always wins over the long run.
Asking if this business is viable or not
is actually much more simple than asking
if almost any other business is viable
because this is math. This is just pure
statistics. The only thing we don't know

[18:00]
statistics. The only thing we don't know
again is the [music] distance, the skill
level, the price that you can charge and
that just comes with more reps. So, if
you are going to launch a business like
this, I recommend doing it for free to
get those numbers down. Take very
specified notes of how many times people
make it, what their skill level is, and
what the distance is, and you could have
good business on your hands. If you
