do you ever drive by an RV park and
think how much money does that thing
make well let me tell you I buy these
things for a living this is the park we
bought last two months ago down in
Louisiana 135 pads sites and this is how
we increased profits by 50% while still
charging our tenants well below a market
rate when we bought it it had 135 pads
sites charging 600 a month at 80%
occupancy we bought it at an 11% cap
rate which is a great price we increased
occupancy from 80 to 90% we raised the
rents from $600 to $700 still well below
Market rents and we dropped the expense
ratio from 40 to 30% so at purchase this
park was profiting about $38,000 a month
but today this park is profiting about
$59,000 a month which is a 50% increase
we made repairs we added value we made
it a better Park we raised rents a
little bit but it's just a better place
to live
