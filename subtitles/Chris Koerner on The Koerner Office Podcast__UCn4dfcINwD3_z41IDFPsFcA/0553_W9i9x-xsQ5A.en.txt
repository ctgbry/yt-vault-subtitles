look at this freaking guy right here we
all love Frankie Leena but I love a good
business idea even more and if fly
boards are a thing and jetpacks are a
thing then this needs to be a business
this needs to be productized how many
people at a ski resort would pay extra
to go up the mountain on this thing now
they're not doing it to avoid the ski
lift they're doing it cuz it looks
freaking fun and awesome and this guy
made this to go viral and it worked good
for him but someone else needs to buy
Andor develop one of these and rent them
out as an experience no different than
renting out kayaks or paddle boards or
what have you full business plan here
