[00:00]
welcome to the ker office I'm going to
make today's episode short and sweet
because it's Christmas Eve and I'm
smoking some ribs right now and I'm
about 30 minutes away from having to put
more logs on the fire so I'm going to do
some listener submitted questions real
fast and then I'm going to give you some
pump up language for 2025 at the end and
I hope it
[Music]
helps let's start with the first
question hey Chris my name is David
Hayes I'm serious about starting that
private jet photo studio here in the
Dallas Fort Worth area but curious to
get your take on how I would decide
location I think people would drive an
hour to it so I don't think it's that
important to be in Dallas what do you
think all right David great question so
most of you probably never saw this but
on social media I posted a reel of a
private jet Studio business and there's
only a couple of these in the United
States New York La maybe Atlanta and
it's going to make you sigh and shrug
but it is what it is people pay $40 to
$200 to rent out a private jet photo
studio so they can Flex on social media

[01:01]
studio so they can Flex on social media
it's dumb it's cringe makes me a little
sad but if they're going to do it then
let's find a way to monetize it that's
what my real is about so David wants to
do this in Dallas where I live and he
said that he thinks people will drive an
hour to do that and maybe he's right I
don't know but if I were launching this
in Dallas I would first Go reverse
engineer the ones in LA and New York as
much as I can where are they what types
of locations are they if I were really
serious about this I'd probably fly to
both New York and LA and see them in
person and get a feel for the
neighborhood are people walking in
spontaneously do they have to book an
appointment what does it cost what's the
booking system like etc etc then I would
go to the web archive I'd go to who
is.com I'd look at how long their social
presences have been around their
websites have been around what does
their website look like I would do all
that first I think people would drive an
hour to take a picture in a private jet
photo studio but I think you're going to
lose a lot of people if it's far away
from a city center so I think you should
try building one of these in a 20ft
shipping container might be a little

[02:01]
shipping container might be a little
tricky because it might be a little
tight in there but I think you'll save a
lot of money and it'll be portable you
can pay 500 bucks to a flatbed to move
that around town you can go find an
outdoor shopping area like Legacy West
or Waters Creek and see if you can get
permission to post up your portable
private jet photo studio get it wrapped
with some cool branding so when people
walk by it they know exactly what it is
because I guarantee you if you take a
hundred people at random and bring an
iPad up to them and say I have a private
jet photo Studio it's an hour away you
can book it right here here you go verse
those same 100 people I have a private
jet photo studio it's right there right
next to you same price same everything
you're going to get significantly more
people and that sounds obvious on the
surface because well of course you will
it's closer but no it's not as obvious
as you think because it's the difference
between a planned purchase and an
impulse purchase and the extra
narcissistic folks out there that really
want a flex they'll drive an hour but
you don't want only them you want the

[03:00]
you don't want only them you want the
mass Market you want to get as close to
the mass Market as you can so you want
to make it as accessible as you can put
it in a walkable outdoor shopping area
like my buddy did with his 40ft shipping
container escape room business he was
able to move that around and he was able
to AB test locations guess what in
retail you can't just AV test locations
you can't you sign five year or 10 year
or 20 year leases but with this you
could so if you put it in a 20ft
shipping container and you find that
walkable outdoor shopping areas aren't
great for this then at least you can
move it you can move it inside a
building if you had to but location wins
always don't skimp on cost on location
when it comes to a retail business like
this next question hey Chris Roberto
garer here from Oklahoma City I'm really
interested in starting up the tree
trimming business idea but the only
issue is I'm currently working for a
company that I'm on calls like from 9 to
5 and don't really have the capacity to
go out to homes and give quotes to
people that want to get their trees
trimmed I'm wondering do you see any
path to stair step into that while also

[04:02]
path to stair step into that while also
maintaining like you know a high quality
service for clients in the tree trimming
business or are there any other
suggestions for business ideas for folks
that can't really commit to a second
business because they're extremely busy
and they're N9 to-5 okay Roberto great
question Roberto wants to start a tree
trimming business much like the one that
we started where we used Crews to do all
the work we didn't own a chainsaw y yada
yada you've heard this story before and
you could really copy this model with
any local home service business he's got
a full-time job at 95 he's got zooms
he's got things he actually has to do
during the day but he really needs to be
going and quoting jobs during the day
eventually you can work up to the point
where your crws go and quote jobs and
you don't have to worry about them
circumventing you for the cash because
you're the one only interfacing with the
customer but for the first few months
you want to quote jobs yourself at least
so you know how to do it and you know
the industry well enough to not get
screwed by your subcontract

[05:00]
screwed by your subcontract
so yes you can still do this of course
it's going to be harder but you can
still do this if you literally have a 9
to5 then try to book things before 9 or
after 5 even if it's in the evening with
a big mag light or try to quote jobs
only on Saturdays or try to line up your
marketing to where every two weeks you
take an afternoon off or a full day off
and you line up all your quotes for that
day that'll get you by for the first one
to three months without interfering with
your regular job and then as you're
quote working as you're on zooms you can
be playing with and list thumb Tech SMS
realtor referrals anything else you need
to do to grow the business that needs to
be done from a computer so yeah you can
get creative with it the fact that you
have a full-time job means you'll have
to get more creative with it and in a
weird way it's kind of an advantage
because it's a constraint and
constraints breed creativity as I often
repeat hey Chris I'm wondering if you're
doing an LLC for every single one of
your business ideas or do you experiment
separately before you decide that it's
worth investing in an LLC is there a way
to put all your experiments into one LLC

[06:00]
to put all your experiments into one LLC
or are you just not worrying about it at
all mostly I'm just want to make sure
that if I'm swashbuckling with some
other businesses in a B2B experiment my
only asset in my house is protected but
I'm looking at this in California and it
is surprisingly expensive for even one
LLC so I'm wondering do I even need to
care about this or is there a loophole
or a cheaper way to do things is it fine
you just go to Legal Zoom and just click
next and fill out the minimum wizard
here to get what I need thanks for your
help okay awesome question question I
have countless llc's and they're $300 a
piece plus I don't even know $50 to $100
a year just to keep it active but
theoretically if I filed an LLC for all
of the 70 plus businesses I've started I
would have a lot more llc's I don't file
llc's until a couple things are true
number one I'm sure that this is going
to be a real thing this is a thing I'm
going to be doing this a year from now
six months from now six years from now
and I already know that because the
other qualifier is the fact that I have
already received revenue for this

[07:00]
already received revenue for this
and it's repeatable Revenue it's not
just friends and family Revenue if I'm
slanging pizzas at a farmers market for
funsies I'm not going to get an LSC for
that unless I have to for regulation
reasons but if I start with that and
then I realize oh I can hire someone for
20 bucks an hour to do this for me and
still make 500 bucks every farmers's
Market yeah I'm going to get an LLC
especially when I start hiring so it's
like there's certain triggers there
right hiring absolutely generating
repeatable Revenue not recurring but
repeatable Revenue like you're pretty
sure this is going to keep going going
absolutely actually I won't say Absolut
most likely okay depending on the
circumstance am I going to be doing this
for a while is this a thing is this
going to stick around have I proven the
model there's product Market fit there's
demand then yes and it sounds like on
the surface that you might file an LLC
in almost every instance but no in fact
usually the tests don't go very well
your launch doesn't go very well I mean
that's life that's the reality of it and
you're just not that enthused by it and
you're not sure so at that point you
either don't buy an LLC and abandon it

[08:01]
either don't buy an LLC and abandon it
or you just keep going and then buy an
LLC later if you think it's something to
keep working on so hi Chris hope you're
doing real well I have funds to invest
like let's say about 50,000 and I want
to buy a fully functioning up and
running Ecommerce website and I want to
have someone else manage it I basically
want to have the passive income and I
have the funds but I'm looking for
someone who has time and expertise but
no funds and I'm looking to kind of
match up with them what you recommend as
far as finding that type of person
hiring them and just putting my excess
funds to work in a non-correlated way
with an e-commerce site that's already
up and running really appreciate all you
do man thank you look forward to hearing
your answer thanks Jim thank you for the
question first of all this format of
people recording questions and leaving
them for me to answer I just realized
another reason why I love it so much
because if I were talking to JY right
now on the phone I don't like
confrontation I don't like awkwardness I
know I would kind of dance around it be
like well you know no no and that's not

[09:01]
like well you know no no and that's not
helpful to me or to Jim that's something
I got to fix I need to be more direct
okay so with this being a recorded
Callin show I feel much more free to be
direct and no you don't have to be rude
to be direct so first of all Jim I just
don't like the phrase passive income
I've heard you know it doesn't exist it
it does exist right it with an asterisk
passive income exists after many years
of hard work of getting you up to that
point for instance if I invest in T
bills at 5% that's very passive that's
very safe but I have to have money to
invest in those T bills and I had to
presumably do a lot of work to get that
money to get to that point to where that
income is actually passive and even
though it is passive it's not a lot the
investors in my RV parks they enjoy
passive income but after years or
Decades of hard work to save up $50,000
to invest in an RV park so I would not
consider investing in an e-commerce
store passive income by any stretch of
the imagination even if you are not the

[10:01]
the imagination even if you are not the
one operating it which is what we're
discussing here I've had eight plus is
different Shopify stores some small some
big I've lived in Shopify since 2012 to
be frank with you Jim I just don't
really like this idea I'm curious what
got you onto this idea investing $50,000
into an Ecom store specifically there's
a selection bias at play let's say you
find a partner that's a great
operator okay then let's say you find a
good deal where you only have to put
down 20% maybe SBA maybe seller finance
well I wouldn't suggest SBA for a small
deal like this because if you have 50
Grand and you're putting down 20% that's
only a $250,000 business if you're going
to go through all the hassle of an SBA
then you want it to be seven figures
right to make it worth your while so
let's say you find a seller finance deal
they finance 80% you put down 20% 50
Grand $250,000 business three times
profit means it's making $80,000 a year

[11:02]
profit means it's making $80,000 a year
in net profit today and you're buying it
because a you think your operator is
great and he's going to pull some levers
to increase the value increase the
profit of the store B you believe in
e-commerce for some reason as an
industry C maybe you really like the
niche that you're buying in let's say
it's golf or pet supplies I don't know
how you would structure this deal with
the operator but there's a selection
bias because if he's really really good
then he's not going to be wasting his
time on a business that has a net profit
of 880,000 that he has to split with you
somehow if he's not really good then
he's going to be excited to do this deal
with you because it'll be a great
opportunity for him but the tradeoff
with that is he's going to have to learn
on the job with you which means this
will be less passive than you expected
so the more passive you want it to be
the better operator you need to partner
with equals the bigger of a business you
need to find equals the harder it's
going to be to find that great operator
because he's probably already tied up
either working for a big D Toc brand

[12:00]
either working for a big D Toc brand
that's VC funded or building his own
brand on Shopify so at that investment
level and the desire of passive income
it's just going to be really hard to
find what you're looking for not
impossible of course but hard where
would you find a business like this
Quiet Light flipper acquire. comom Bisby
sell.com those are the big four Shopify
used to have their own market place for
buying and selling Shopify stores but
they closed it down for whatever reason
so Jim this is tough because if you use
a 3pl for this business then there's not
going to be much profit left but if you
fulfill products yourself then it
especially won't be passive and you're
going to need a warehouse or some sort
of a facility unless it's a digital
product in which case it's probably
closer to a SAS business or an agency
business than a pure e-commerce business
which is what you want so that's my hard
truth but I hope it saves you some
heartache all right if you are watching

It's weekly it's different content than
my podcast and YouTube newsletter.
chrisj cerner.com You'll see the link
and we'll see you there hey Chris this
is Bill in Orange Beach Alabama big
follower of all your stuff I really
appreciate it learning a lot my business
is online personal training and I'm kind
of specifically targeting male high-
performing real estate agents my
question is is after the first cold
email goes out gets opened but no
replies know what's a reasonable
followup I know 3 to 5 days I'm kind of
using upticks doio for everything but
I'm just not sure once I've sort of
captured a quote unquote lead what to do
with it should it not reach out and say
hey yeah selling your product what do I
do next to kind of keep them on the hook
also got a Facebook page and opening up
a LinkedIn page just sort of curious how
you would proceed thanks again and I
appreciate your work Bill thank you for
the message thank you for being a fan
thank you for living in Orange Beach cuz

[14:00]
thank you for living in Orange Beach cuz
that's one of my favorite beaches on the
planet and if next year goes well I'm
going to buy a house down there anyway I
love that you're selling online personal
training for high performing real estate
agents oh I just love a good Niche and
I'm sure that you're in that Niche
because you found something special
there and good for you Bill because you
deserve it all right you asked about
generating customers from cold emails
specifically what does the follow-up
sequence look like okay of course this
could be different based on the industry
but what's worked well for me is initial
email with at least two points of
personalization keep the subject line
very very short two words Max first name
pitch pitch pitch yada yada yada less
than three sentences in the body end it
with a question don't put a question in
there and then end it with a comment
always end it with a question because
that question is a call to action any
question is a call to action you're
asking them to respond to you okay
always end your first C email with a
question keep it simple don't put any

[15:00]
question keep it simple don't put any
links in the first email because it
could not will but it could affect
deliverability and you don't want your
results to be tainted by some dumb
deliverability glitch it's tempting but
people aren't going to buy Cold anyway
you got to warm them up especially for
something like this so first followup
would be two days later next followup
would be 3 days after that so 5 days
after the initial one and then I would
never ever follow up more than three
times so it's like 2 days and then 3
days and then 7 days and then leave them
alone
because your chance of getting a
response or a sale with every follow-up
drops by like 80% that's what I would do
and for an offer like this I don't know
what your exact offer is but for a
service like this I would recommend just
do everything you can to get them on the
phone as soon as possible since this is
such a personal sale and personal offer
it would be a great time If This Were a
live call and show because I could ask
you followup questions like how much
does it cost what's the actual offer but
we don't have that luxury so I have to
make some assumptions thank you for
calling in hey I sound like a little bit

[16:01]
calling in hey I sound like a little bit
of a crazy person but I recently
purchased two big inflatable walls that
convention centers would use for big
events I work with an event space in my
neighborhood in Cleveland Ohio and I'm
wondering how I can use these two 25 ft
x 25 ft by 9 ft high inflatable walls as
like a side hustle to rent out either
Target like wedding planners or private
events and any ideas you have there or
any resources that you have already you
can point me to thank thank you clay I
love the question inflatable walls I
didn't know that was a thing but
obviously I love all things inflatable
bounce houses included and I love
questions like this oh I love questions
like this you need to watch the show I
think you should leave not around kids
preferably I watch it on vid Angel when
I can when I remember but there's this
one skit in the first or second episode
of season 3 where he's a driving kuner
and he's driving around and I I can't
even explain because it sounds too weird

[17:00]
even explain because it sounds too weird
and it's a lot of his skits are not that
funny the first or second time you watch
it but then they get hilariously funny
and he has a line in there that I think
of all the time and it's I gotta figure
out how to make money on this so that's
what I'm thinking of I love that
question how do I make money on two 9 by
25 by 25 foot inflatable walls so I were
you the first thing I would do when
working with like a really weird new
unique product or offer go up this
supply chain go back to the source who
did you buy this from where did you buy
it what other companies sell this maybe
they're a distributor maybe they're the
manufacturer in China get them on the
phone not email but phone as many people
as you can and just ask them who are
your customers not specifically but are
they event planners are they brides are
they Conference Centers who's buying
these how are they using them does
anyone rent these out if so how much do
they rent them out for where do they
place them up for rent are they on peer
space Facebook Marketplace the knot what
ever go up the supply chain and start

[18:01]
ever go up the supply chain and start
asking as many questions as you can and
that will give you all the ideas you
need I could give you more ideas but
honestly that's the 8020 of it that's
where you're going to get the best info
hello Chris thank you for this
opportunity my name is Leticia I'm a dog
trainer in the area of Washington DC and
I been on and off in this business for
11 years I have a good feedback from
clients they like my training to be
honest I think like this is a very small
City I want to get to every house here
with the dog I'm like this must be easy
for you guys so was like maybe I reach
out to you and see if you have some
ideas to reach a lot more people here
I'm very famous in my neighborhood but I
want to be famous in the whole city if
you have any ideas I will appreciate it
thank you so much and I love all your
videos in podcast and following you
everywhere thank you so much Leticia I

[19:01]
everywhere thank you so much Leticia I
love your question love your business
love your energy dog training business
in DC you're famous in your neighborhood
you want to be famous in all of DC how
do you do it well look at your biggest
competitors who are the competitors that
are not just big but the ones that just
seem to be doing it all right the ones
that you really look up to and respect
in any business we all have them we have
that one other company that we maybe
they were our inspiration to start it
maybe we just admire them from afar and
from the outside looking in it's how do
they just do everything right their
social media post everything their
offers they're pricing they're always
busy I just want to be more like them I
know you've got someone like that what
did they do to get there how can you
find out how can you get sneaky to find
out do you pose as a customer and call
them up and ask like what a great
business how long have you been in
business geez how do you find your
customers yet what do you have to lose
right find the people in your Market
that are doing it right that are big
enough to scale throughout all of DC and
reverse engineer you can use a app Tik

[20:02]
reverse engineer you can use a app Tik
Tok and Instagram sorter it's a Chrome
extension it's free and you install it
then you go to Tik Tok and Instagram in
your Chrome browser and you can sort by
their oldest post you can put the oldest
at the top you can put their most viewed
at the top I use it every day it's
awesome you can do that to find their
best performing post their oldest post
how have their offerings evolved over
time web archive who is look at what
their website has looked like over the
years in DC did they used to be famous
in their neighborhood and then they blew
up what did it take to get from that to
that that's going to be the most
specific and relevant thing you can do
for your market and this applies to any
local service business and I guarantee
you if your competitor has grown fast in
DC a lot of times we're like oh what are
they doing they must have made this
amazing hire y y y and a lot of times
honestly the 8020 of it it's just
Facebook or Google ads that's it and
they're not even Wizards at it they just
found a good offer paired with a good

[21:00]
found a good offer paired with a good
video or a good picture a good coupon
whatever and they just scale the heck
out of that ad and it works or it's just
for local it could just be Angie list
they give Angie list $30,000 a month
right or Thumbtack or whatever or sniff
spot right or one of those dog walking
marketplaces that's another thing you
can do is go to those marketplaces where
you can find jobs and who has the most
reviews and how did they get there maybe
they're just exploiting one or two
marketplaces and getting all of their
customers from there giving them all of
their marketing dollars and they're not
using Facebook or Google ads at all you
got to reverse engineer it all right
well that wraps up the Q&A section I
want to end with just a couple minutes
of advice for 2025 I might do another
episode it's the 24th we have another
week for like end of this year beginning
of next year I don't know yet
but I just thought of this framework
recently and by nature of my job people
come to me a lot and they're like all
right I want to do this I want to start
this SLE I want to start this business
or they come to me and they said I quit
my job I started this business like just

[22:00]
my job I started this business like just
trust me by nature of my job I hear
about people every single day that want
to quit they want to start something
they want to sell something side hustle
full-time business whatever and I will
tell you this truth I've never talked to
anyone that was on the fence about
starting a business or quitting their
job and did it and then say they
regretted it I shouldn't have done that
I should have kept my job I didn't
realize how good I had it are they out
there I'm sure they're out there
absolutely people declare bankruptcy
they feel all the time but given a long
enough time Horizon even the people that
fail don't regret quitting their job
because of what that failure ended up
turning into okay and that's just a
framework for life we don't usually
regret things that we do I'm excluding
things like terrible life decisions
right if you go rob a grocery store
you're going to regret that right so I'm
excluding that stupid stuff we don't
usually regret stuff that we do we
regret stuff that we didn't do think
back to your own life what do you regret
it's probably something that you wanted
to do or that you were doing and then

[23:02]
to do or that you were doing and then
you quit and you're like I shouldn't
have quit like I wrestled in high school
it's silly it's a silly little thing but
I've talked to so many people they're
like oh I started wrestling and I was I
was kind of good at and I quit I
shouldn't have quit or or I was really
good at wrestling but I I never ended up
play like I've talked to so many people
like we regret the things that we don't
take action on not the things that we do
take action on so take action and that
leads me into my next piece of advice I
was hanging out with this guy named
Mitchell Cohen and if you've heard of
appsumo he does all their content and
he's awesome and he was at my house
right here where I'm sitting yesterday
and he filmed a video for their YouTube
channel and we were talking about he
works for Noah Kagan Noah Kagan owns
appsumo it's a software company and Noah
Kagan had a book that came out he was on
this podcast six months ago and his book
is awesome and the first chapter of his
book is called now not how and that idea
that three-w phrase that I've come to
love over these last 24 hours came from
Mitchell their head of content who was
at my house
he gave the idea to Noah Noah credited

[24:01]
he gave the idea to Noah Noah credited
it to him in his book now not how okay
and Mitchell thought of it while he was
out for a run one day don't get
paralyzed don't have analysis paralysis
just do just take action collect Revenue
buy the domain name move forward move
the ball forward a little bit every day
in 2025 now not how thank you so much
for listening this is the first year of
my podcast it's been 10 amazing months
really really really appreciate you guys
thank you for sticking with me and we
will see you next time
