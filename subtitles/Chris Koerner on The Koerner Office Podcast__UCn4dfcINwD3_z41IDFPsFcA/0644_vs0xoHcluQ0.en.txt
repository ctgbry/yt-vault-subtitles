[00:00]
so meds SPS are growing at five times
the average rate of growth in the United
States economy those pools cost 130
Grand but of those families that have
pools how many of them have cold plunges
or saunas they're growing like crazy
they have great margins like 15 to 20%
some of them can even go higher than
that so there's always going to be
demand for these things that seem like a
trend by the time agents become usable
people like Chris and I are going to be
way ahead of you so just get educated
now bottom line is we're early start
playing around with it you're going to
make a million bucks by being detailed
and understanding every part of it
we're getting older we're Millennials
Millennials are vain but they're also
worried about their health and so we're
seeing massive explosion in Med Spas for
those who don't know what Med Spas are
they are essentially cosmetic places for
people to go and relax but they give
things like botox
injectables some of them do more health
related things so they'll do like the
semi glutide treatments right everyone's
heard of OIC that's what that's what
those are

[01:00]
those are
hormone replacement therapies some do
testosterone replacement but essentially
it's Aesthetics it's coming in you're
aging you want to get some fillers you
want to get some Botox whatever they're
taking off like crazy because our
generation in particular we're not only
obsessed with health but we're obsessed
with aging so here are some stats the
current meds bom Market in the United
States is about $4 billion but it's
growing at over 10% a year annually so
just for context the like the US total
economy is probably growing at 2 to 3 %
a year so metpa are growing at five
times the average rate of growth in the
United States economy so they're growing
like crazy they have great margins like
15 to 20% some of them can even go
higher than that and you're doing
something that's like one of my favorite
Frameworks which is taking advantage of
a current Trend like you have the
Tailwinds pushing behind you quote that
I like a quote that I like it's like my
favorite boat is a boat that has a
Tailwind so it's like cool you know how
to do a rowo really good that's great
I'm just going to go to the place where

[02:00]
I'm just going to go to the place where
I know the wind's going to be pushing at
my back so to me it's taking advantage
of like a couple of these things that
are coming into place and so I love Mets
Spas a friend of mine it has a
membership at a golf course and some
golf club and a new buyer out of
California bought the golf club they're
shutting it down they're renovating it
and they're going to be building some
new condos on like they're making it a
lot nicer they're putting some amenities
in and he approached the owner and was
like Hey what if we added a golf or a
med spa and we give a discount to the
members and the own new owner like
that's really
interesting because it allows to give
another benefit to its members it's
sticky it's high margin the people who
are able to afford the med spa or excuse
me the golf membership are probably also
going to be able to afford the metpa
hopefully we don't get a lot of hate
mail but probably 90% of golf
memberships are men golfing so this
gives an opportunity for like men to
bring their spouses to the club and give
them an added benefit so like it reduces

[03:02]
them an added benefit so like it reduces
some tension there like they're in talks
right now of developing a Med Spot that
would like go on the campus of the golf
course with this new build that's
happening so as I saw that I was like
dude that's super interesting he's
piggybacking like it's what we talk
about all the time and it just happens
to be on the local level I think it
would be really interesting if you were
if you were interested in doing the
metpa in looking at Country Club
memberships golf membership Tennis Club
me wherever and scop out spaces near
those establishments for space at a med
spa and you could test this idea a
million different ways but that's sort
of the general premise that I've set up
what do you think do you know what the
structure is like is he just going to
pay rent is it going to be a revenue
share agreement they haven't worked it
out yet according to my friend the owner
of the golf club is like not interested
in having Equity this is according to
him I can't I can't imagine a scenario
where I would do that I would think
there'd be some type of rev share or

[04:00]
there'd be some type of rev share or
affiliate agreement or something but
according to him he's like no he just
likes the idea of there being an added
benefit for his members and so I would
just come up with the money I would do
the remodeling I would provide the
Physicians and the the clinical
oversight I would do all the business
and give a discounted rate to the club
he would have no equity ownership in it
so according to him that's the current
model I don't think that's normal though
I I think that these golf clubs would
want a share and and frankly that's how
I would pitch it is like hey you would
get a piece of this because I'd really
want them bought in to the men Spa yeah
I look at it as kind of like the like a
Walmart model or a indoor shopping model
where the parent lease holder like
Walmart or a shopping mall takes not a
percentage of equity but a percentage of
Revenue percentage of your sales like
when I had an iPhone repair store inside
a mall we had to pay 2200 bucks a month
plus like 10% of all of our revenue and
that was standard that's normal so to me
would make sense because if it's like a

[05:01]
would make sense because if it's like a
if it's a big medspot company they
probably don't have a vehicle for giving
away equity in a location to some random
Golf Course owner but they probably do
have a vehicle to give away a percentage
of Revenue right yeah that might work
the other example of this are like eye
clinics I don't know what the word to
call them is but like every Walmart has
an yeah eyer Great Clip Subway inside of
Walmart and all that right CCO has these
as well so it's like it's not
unprecedented oh my members are this
demographic they all o like these things
let's put that offering in there the
golf course Med Spa is a good pairing
but I'm sure there's tons of these types
of pairings anywhere that you have
memberships so that's why I mentioned
like the tennis club Country Club I'm
trying to think of some other whatever
membership types of companies if you
look at that there is some other
adjacent offering that that current
membership isn't giving that you can
take advantage of I think working Your
Way backwards again from the
distribution are some cool ways to
identify opportunities fun fact did you

[06:01]
identify opportunities fun fact did you
know that there's a regulation that
requires optometrist to have an exterior
door and so if you find a Walmart that
has an optometrist inside you will see a
random door on the front of the Walmart
leading only into that optometrist my
friend Dan owns an optometry clinic
inside of Walmart in Washington tell me
that I mean that doesn't surprise me
like home health and hospice we had to
have separate entrance and exit doors so
like from a healthcare standpoint I
guess I could see that being the case
but no I did not I did not know that so
every Walmart eye center has a separate
entrance looks really random too when
you look for it how do we make money off
of that I got a couple thoughts kid so I
like the idea of piggybacking on golf
courses in general I wonder what else
you could do there on one hand this med
spa idea is like oh this is really
interesting because now husbands can
bring their wives to the golf course and
the wives can just go to the med spa and
the husband's going golf on the other
hand that's not a behavior you know what
I'm saying that's not a current behavior

[07:00]
I'm saying that's not a current behavior
so that makes me nervous oh oh I I see
what you're saying if it's 90% men that
go to a golf course and 90% women that
go to a med spa is that doomed for
failure men are using Botox more and
more as a percentage of the population
this particular Golf Course has other
amenities for families so there are a
lot
of Country Club yes yeah okay that's
that's the best way to say it it's it's
not just a golf club it's it's it's a
country club I don't disagree with you
right cuz you're making some assumptions
on Behavior but that's probably why the
golf course is like yeah cool if you
want to open it it'll be good good for
our members but you know they're not
necessarily taking skin of the game but
that's yeah that's a good another idea I
had a guest on my podcast a few months
ago that opened a sauna cold plunge
business inside a gym oh and it's going
great and the buildout is not that much
he bought two cold plunges for like five
grand each and then two saunas for like
10 grand each and just plopped them

[08:00]
10 grand each and just plopped them
inside this empty square footage that
the gym had right when you walk in so
like you walk in there's the desk you go
to the right to go to use the gym and
then like straight in front of you there
was this empty room that they weren't
using and he just rents it from the gym
that was his first location why not like
likey yeah golf course yeah golf courses
country clubs right that's the again
that's the perfect population those are
going to be the guys who like yeah I got
my country club membership and we have
now a cold Plunge in a sauna
well just as like a framework it could
be find a a facility that already has a
locker room showers and a bathroom and
then go piggyback your cold plunge and
sauna on top of that maybe it's a gym
maybe it's a country club maybe it's a
pool like a public pool right yeah what
do we think dude okay sh I'm gonna take
your framework bring another framework
seemingly unrelated but I think it is
related I think all of well at least you
and I have definitely had these
experiences life were like oh I want to

[09:00]
experiences life were like oh I want to
buy some Amazon stock nah it's
overvalued it's probably the high is
ever going to be I've been saying that
for 20 years right Tesla stock you could
have said the same thing Apple stock
like whatever whatever the stock is
you're like I think it's kind of hit its
peak and it's only ever continued to
grow but at some point you are right you
could be right sure so there's two sides
of that I do think that there is a point
where you reach Market saturation and
you're kind of like capped from that
standpoint but 20 years ago when we were
looking at this if we had been smart and
been like hm these are the user adoption
Trends wow 50% of the market still not
on the internet oh my gosh what
percentage of people actually order
things from Amazon oh how many people
have an iPhone like if we would have
done more critical analysis we probably
would have said yeah this is the way
that things are going and now I'm better
at doing that that's the same way I feel
about some of these Trends so you might
say oh cold plunge and saunas those are
that's oversaturated at this point MH
but the truth and the reality is we're

[10:00]
but the truth and the reality is we're
not yeah if you want to go and open a
cold smooth juice smoothie place yeah
we're probably oversaturated jice did
that 20 years ago but cold plunges in
saas no so like just finding those
things that are trends that you see
becoming more and more popular and then
putting them into places to give people
access is an interesting framework
because most of the time I would think
like C plunges and saas are
oversaturated but they're not like
they're just not like if you look what's
that graph that's like the distribution
of early adops oh yeah but it's like
early adopters adopters and like by the
time it goes mainstream it's still not
even done growing right so it's like I
don't even think Co plunges and sonas
have gone mainstream so there's an
opportunity to place it on Twitter they
have right which is not representative
but I'm thinking of the the mid whip
meme bell curve right this is more
related to like Market size in General
on one end it's like an total data like

[11:00]
on one end it's like an total data like
my friend doesn't have a cold plunge so
we're early right and then you go to the
middle and it's like yeah but that's not
inacurate sample size and then on the
other end I think that's still true like
you have to be experiencing something
that's happening in that industry for it
to be relevant or not for instance I go
to church with a bunch of people my
similar age literally and this is not an
exaggeration of like 50 60 families I go
to church with 80% of them have pools
right and maybe of those 80% more than
half were since Co and those pools cost
130 Grand but of those families that
have pools how many of them have cold
plunges or saunas I don't think any of
them right so if you can afford a pool
you have a family and you're of the
demographic that values the the benefits
that cold plunges and saunas offer then
statistically speaking all those people
I go to church with are probably going
to own a cold plunger a sauna at some
point but they don't yet adding on to
that I I know I just crapped on Jadu a

[12:00]
that I I know I just crapped on Jadu a
second ago but Jadu has proved that
there's demand for smoothies there is
probably somewhere in this world many
places in this world in the United
States where you could plop a jamb juice
down and it would do really well because
there's some percentage of Demand right
like so there's always going to be
demand for these things that seem like a
trend crumble cookies is an example
right crumble May Plateau at some point
but there's always going to be a place
that would support a crumble cookies
franchise so
just going back to it it's about
thinking through the distribution I love
the gym idea freaking love that idea of
like placing Nas I love the idea of
placing theas at tennis clubs at uh
fitness clubs at country clubs like golf
courses wherever you just need to think
through okay where are the people who
would use this going and how can I get
them access like how can I get them
distribution to this product is just a
really cool way to think about it I
agree we're so smart I had some other
thoughts on that so when you were

[13:01]
thoughts on that so when you were
talking about Med Spa and golf courses I
started thinking about other
piggybacking opportunities right and how
like this med spa is going to go one of
two ways it hasn't opened yet right yeah
no no no no in my opinion it's going to
crush or it's going to completely tank
right that's that's nothing in between
that's usually how new things go like a
medspot a golf course is a new thing
he's either going to find perfect
product audience fit or it's just not
going to go well because golfers don't
go to Med Spa okay
how far away are we from remember the
game The Sims right how far away and
this is way too Niche like not Niche for
the people listening but it's niche for
the general public where we can have an
AI enabled Sims game where we can like
play out scenarios like that on a
computer on a simulation for instance
with the perfume vending machines one
thing I said in that first video they
went viral was I wish I could take a
hundred of these things and place them
in a hundred different types of venues
gas stations medspot all different types

[14:01]
gas stations medspot all different types
and then just look at the data say wow
for whatever reason the perfume vending
machines right next to the ice cream
store just Crush just Crush every single
one of them without exception we need to
go find all the ice cream stores
piggyback and put a perfum like you
can't do that affordably you can't do
you got to spend millions of dollars and
you got to call you got to play them but
like what about an AI enabled something
where I'm thinking like a deep research
right or a chat GPT version where you
can just type in a prompt and it's going
to run simulations based on everything
it knows about traffic counts about
human psychology human behavior without
spending a dime outside of your $200
month subscription fee you can get that
question answered for you I love the
idea there's two things that you're
talking about the first thing
is you need to I like figuring
out what the demographic is of your
ideal customer uh uhuh and by
demographics I don't just mean like

[15:01]
demographics I don't just mean like
white black male female Rich poor but
like oh no 35-year-old living in this
type of City they drive this kind of car
they go to this kind of a store like
just very granular stuff so figuring out
your ICP that's one of them and then the
other one is like testing whether or not
this would actually work because you can
have your ICP and you can think oh in
this area it's going to work but then
you go to test it and it's like oh this
didn't this didn't work this is where
you were going with it but one thing I
thought would be really interesting is
this would be for someone who actually
had some money let's say how much did
these uh coal plunges cost I think five
grand or so okay so let's say you and I
are like let's let's drop 20 grand and
buy four of these so like one or two
coal plunges two saas cool MH and then
we just go to different places and for a
month test them at each place it's like
hey Jim can we just rent this from you
for a month cool and then see what
demand is like and then we go to the
mall hey Mall you have this open spot

[16:00]
mall hey Mall you have this open spot
can we rent this for you from you for a
month so there would definitely be some
upfront cost you'd have to buy theas
you'd have to pay some rent but you
would like really quickly get to be able
to test theand like that's one way to do
it or you could just do the growth hack
things that you've done in the past
which is like go to the gym and say hey
Jim can I just put a sign up here that
says in two months we're gonna have a
sauna and cold plunge sign up here if
you're interested MH just a test demand
get your first month free by giving us
fre email with a QR code yes so like
there's a bunch of different ways I
think you could go about testing demand
the question is because I'm with you on
this how do you then leverage
AI to make sure that you're you have a
higher probability of success that's
that's the piece I'm like how would you
how would you use AI for that okay I got
an idea you ready okay let's use the
cold plunge example so let's just speak
hypothetically we want to know what type
of location could we piggyback a let's
just say cold plunge no on a just cold
punch cool okay mhm all right so what

[17:03]
punch cool okay mhm all right so what
data is out there you've got ivis World
reports okay on Industries so we could
have operator go pull and now I know
that cost money right hear me out it
goes and pull pulls an IIs World Report
on the cold plugge industry and it can
tell us in what states they're trending
the most okay okay so we could Whittle
it down there then we can take it a step
further you can go to Google Trends and
you can find out which states
proportionately speaking to its
population are searching for cold
plunges the most so that's a second data
point for the same type of research and
then you can say go to the Wisconsin
franchise search because Wisconsin is
one of the only states that forces
franchisors to publish their FDD their
franchise Disclosure document freely for
the world so then you could say and you
probably won't even need to tell it it
would just do this in in this scenario
it would go to the Wisconsin franchise
search web page it would search for any
franchise that offers any typee of Cal

[18:01]
franchise that offers any typee of Cal
plunge Services it would read the entire
franchise disclosure document it would
find the locations that are performing
the best let's say Colorado is the state
where everyone's searching for it it
finds all the franchise locations in
Colorado and it finds the four best
performing stores and it learns that all
four of them are next to an LA Fitness
and like it could stop there and
automatically you know okay LA Fitness
they might have a contract with this
franchise so I can't go there but I can
go to a Planet Fitness or I could go to
a mom and pop gym in Colorado and I know
that my chance of success will be
significantly higher and it only looked
at like two or three different things
and it's it's already capable of doing
all that today what are you thinking I
freaking love that as you the minute you
started talking I had the idea do you
remember a few months ago or weeks I
don't know when it was where we were
like you need to be thinking now how
you're going to use AI this is one of
those perfect examples of in the past
man sonas are really taken off where
could I place them H I don't know Google

[19:02]
could I place them H I don't know Google
where do I typically Place saunas right
you're using Google as like this
question and answer now your frame of
ref you can go to I'm going to use AI
they're my employee they're going to
help me find this even before you go to
the steps that you said you're just like
this prompt you have PhD level
experience in the sauna industry I would
like to not only learn about the
industry but find the best locations for
this help me walk through how I would go
about gathering this information and
then all I think about this how should I
think about this and then all of a
sudden you have a two-way sort of
communication with AI and it's like
helping you think through it and then
eventually you'll get to like okay cool
cool cool yeah that's a good idea I
should look at whatever X Y and Z
criteria great now take that criteria
and you can do that with chat GPT with
20 bucks a month then you go to deep
research and operator and you can say
hey look this is what I want you to do I
want you to go to these websites then I
want you to pull this data then I want
you to aggregate it here and put it in

[20:01]
you to aggregate it here and put it in
one place then you can look at the data
and then you ask deep research to say
okay this is the data take the data I've
collected take all the data on the
internet merge them together tell me the
top five opportunities give me the
justifications and how much it would
cost me to operate in those markets like
that right there you could do probably
in a day or two that would have normally
taken us I don't know two weeks right
like it's like you find like one
subreddit and then all of a sudden you
talk to a guy and you have conversation
and it takes us a long time to kind of
like aggregate all this information but
all of a sudden you've got two employees
working for you with AI and you can very
quickly get to the point where you're
like cool now I know this is my Target
demographic these are the places I need
to look in my city this is where I want
to place them and all of a sudden you've
increased the probability of your
success by 50% just by having the right
research I like I love freaking I love
that framework so video is cool but you
you know what's better long form audio

[21:00]
you know what's better long form audio
via podcast and my newsletter TKO
pod.com go there to subscribe for free
to my newsletter it's one email a week
very tactical and then go to my audio
podcast three episodes a week stuff like
this you're going to love it all free no
sleazy sales TKO pod.com well dude
and not just that but how many times
have you heard a random podcast or
watched a random YouTube video that had
like something insanely insightful that
you've never heard anywhere else right I
interviewed this guy that has this
business inside a gym son and C and he
got super tactical in my interview and
he this guy doesn't go on podcast I
think mine was the only one he's ever
been on and he was very like this is
what we charge this is what our churn is
this is how many sales we did the first
year this is the address of the gym the
gym has two locations our second
location is not going to be in a gym
like No One's Gonna find that you're
just not but AI could find that I have a
tip for people that I think will make
somebody listening to this if they
implement it a ton of money a ton of
money I'm not and like this is not h
go to YouTube hook Muhammad make that

[22:00]
go to YouTube hook Muhammad make that
the hook is this called the is this
called the just the tip segment this is
just the just a tip my friend let's say
you find that interview right and it's
like go to Chris's
interview copy the URL then go sign up
for this software called
descript I think the free version offers
this even if the free version doesn't
it's like maybe five bucks I don't know
copy the URL paste it into descript
guess what's going to happen descript is
going to to transcribe that whole entire
conversation for you if you've ever
tried to transcribe anything from
YouTube it's a pain it doesn't give
attribution to who's talking the breaks
and the lines are like really difficult
the time markers make it weird but you
copy and paste into dript you will have
the entire transcript and now you can
take that and put it into chat GPT and
say this person talked about saas on
Chris's podcast I would like you to
summarize their business model help me
understand distribution startup costs
margins who I need to hire like any

[23:00]
margins who I need to hire like any
questions that you want and it will spit
it out for you because someone gave a
super insightful interview and now you
have the transcript that you can then
put into chat TPT or gemini or like
whatever else you use right but I've
used this so many times like just
prepping for podcasts there's a ton of
value doing this I promise you if you're
listening to this do it like you like
and thank me later it will make you a
lot of money that's a great tip just the
tip it could do all this research on
these public publicly available
databases Ibis World Wisconsin franchise
search it could look at S1 documents for
publicly traded companies it could go
find interviews with the founder of the
cold plunge. comom or whatever they're
selling tens of millions of dollar yeah
but I would say I would say everything
you just named the S1 the fdds all the
publicly disclosed documents everybody
else is doing that it's that next step
that you just said the LA very last
thing find an interview with the founder
like if you do that next step people
aren't doing that yet maybe if they're
getting paid full-time and they work at
a private Equity Fund or a venture fund
or something like that a family office

[24:00]
or something like that a family office
they're doing that but most people are
not doing that go find the interviews go
find the conversations that they've had
because they're going to say way more in
those conversations you could take it a
step further and say okay the three La
fitnesses in Colorado where this does
the best I want you to tell me the crime
data for those three zip codes the
unemployment rate for those three zip
codes the economic growth rate the
percentage of retail square footage like
people would not think to do that but
it's all just cross referencing and it
could do that you haven't messed much
with research deep research does this so
I've done this a couple times with deep
research where I've said two things the
first thing is before I even get to that
if you were looking at this
data what are some nonobvious correlated
data points that I should be extracting
and then it will like tell me oh you
should look at crime statistics you
should look at income you should look at
disposable income spent at Whole Foods
you know what I mean like things that I
didn't even think of cool and then you
take those and you say do me an analysis

[25:00]
take those and you say do me an analysis
I want you to see how correlated these
two data points are and whether or not
the correlation equals causation because
it will run a regression analysis which
is freaking nuts and it will spit out
it's like this is the r squar this is
like this is how not only correlated
they are but how much causal effect this
variable has on this variable so it's
pretty insane because like there's a
website I can't remember what it is but
like it will show you Iowa security
guards named Jim and the price of cacao
in Africa and they're like they're like
perfectly grafted over time right it's
like okay just because they're
correlated doesn't mean there's
causation there but you can get that
information by using deep research I've
used it but not for like graphing stuff
that's pretty nuts yeah it was nuts when
I asked it to do it I was like holy crap
because math just hasn't been as good
for the for these models yeah so I was
going to do a segment on Chris cron our
our favorite ridiculous Guru and can I
I'm not going to do it because it's just

[26:00]
I'm not going to do it because it's just
not good content but can I tell you what
the prompt was and what I love about
deep research please so my prompt was do
a deep dive on Chris cron his
controversies upbringing personal life
family crazy stories quotes or sayings
impressive Feats and what I love about
deep research is before it it gets going
it asks you follow-up questions which is
so nice right because it's taking like
we've been saying for months now like
ask chat GPT what to ask chat GPT ask it
how to use it it but now like deep
research it takes it a step further and
it just it asks you right it skips that
so then it said would you like a
balanced overview including both his
achievements and controversies or are
you looking for a more specific angle do
you want information public records
interviews or social media insights and
I said balance and yes to the to the
second question so it took five minutes
exactly it cited 29 different sources
and it gave me 3,700 words worth of like
really in-depth content really in-depth
well like what you're saying on the Deep

[27:00]
well like what you're saying on the Deep
research side is what I'm excited about
because typically you ask chat TPT a
question it gives you an answer and you
have to like almost think of a way to
ask it to then prompt you to ask the
right questions I don't know if that
makes sense yeah but like I did this
with these research as well I'll read it
to you hey I want to re I want you to
make me this list of these providers in
this area and I was like okay cool to
provide you a comprehensive list um I
want to clarify the following are you
looking for all providers including
small independent agencies or just major
providers do you prefer a specific
Revenue range should I prioritize data
from official sources like Medicare
State Health departments or business
directories how would you like the data
formatted in a table it's like yeah I
didn't even think of those things that's
a good question how do I want the data
prioritized do I want you to like go to
Reddit or do I want you to go to the
Bureau of Labor Statistics H like that's
what's great about the Deep research is
it it's all of a sudden a PhD level
assistant to you to then follow up with
you ask you the right question because
it knows you're going to ask them later

[28:00]
it knows you're going to ask them later
anyways if I have a really intelligent
assistant or employee in real life and I
ask them to do something like the best
of the best ask me six follow-up
questions because I'm super high level
super broad I don't give nearly enough
detail ever so they're okay do you want
this this this like I know that they're
on it and they have that attention to
detail that I don't have that's what
deep research is another cool framework
if if you're not spending $200 a month
it's just to think like from open ai's
perspective they don't want to give
super long in-depth answers because that
costs them more money but you can still
get that from it and so if I'm using the
$20 a month plan or the free plan and I
want like 10,000 words worth of content
I will first ask it for an outline like
a table of contents or bullet point and
then I'll say all right yes number one
dive like I want to I want you to be as
detailed as possible on number one okay
number two be as DET like it's a little
tedious but you will get tens of
thousands of words on That's So we've
never talked about I do the I do the
same thing which it's nice now on deep

[29:01]
same thing which it's nice now on deep
research I don't have to do that but
when you didn't have you know 200 bucks
a month before you couldn't do that so
it's like all right first how should I
do the outline spits out the outline
great let's just do one section at a
time and if you want you can even get
more granular with like each bullet
point I do dude I do the same thing
because the devil is in the details
you're not going to make a million bucks
with some highle overview or scaffolding
of an idea you're going to make a
million bucks being detailed and
understanding every every part of it so
I dude I I love that idea so in the last
two weeks open a has come out with two
what we feel like are gamechanging
additions to their product one of them
is called GPT operator what this is is
an like the first iteration of an AI
agent that will go out and execute a
command on your behalf in the past I'd
asked chat gbt a question like how would
I do something boom it returns an answer
now I can say operator I want you to
pull this data from this website and put

[30:00]
pull this data from this website and put
it into this table and it will go out
and do it okay so that's operator and
then there's chat GPT deep research
which they came out with about a week
after chat GPT operator deep research
will go you ask it to go do a bunch of
things hey research all of these topics
it then takes that information spits it
into a report
essentially that answers your question
many companies do this so I you
mentioned I world I worked at Ibis world
for a while it's like an industry report
company where you can go and purchase
industry reports from them and there's
an analyst who on the back and did all
the research and put it together there
are investment Banks large Banks they'll
put together research reports for
publicly traded companies Consulting
companies do this as well so like
there's a broad market for these type of
Consulting research reports essentially
what this is doing is is that are those
research reports this isn't the first
time this has been done Google did this
as well they have a deep research
project product as well that's really
good but anyways chat GPT introduced

[31:00]
good but anyways chat GPT introduced
both of these and if you pay $200 a
month you can have access to both and
Chris and I have been diving in to both
of them so Chris I'm gonna start with
you operator pros and cons tell me about
it I gotta get this thought out of my
head first are we worried about Ibis
world like they gota they're G to have
to drop their prices
right because if if I'm Ibis world I'm
just going to use this to generate my
reports right I'm not going to like just
go sit in a corner and cry and shut down
shop but these reports are significantly
less valuable now are they not like it's
going to take a while it's not going to
happen overnight but how do you charge
three grand for a PDF I worked at these
companies so I know this for people who
are listening Ibis world does this hey I
want to know about aftermarket parts
manufacturers in the car space cool all
I want to learn about the industry and
so companies like Ibis world will
produce a report they'll say this is how
big the total addressable Market is this
is what the typical uh profitability of
an operator is this is theow Trend these
are the major problems we see these are

[32:00]
are the major problems we see these are
the major Tailwinds that we see this is
what the next 5 10 15 years look like
ETA like gives you a holistic overview
for somebody who's interested in
investing into the space so what Chris
is saying is isn't that going to put
them out of business I actually don't
think so I think what it's going to I
don't no I don't think it's gonna put us
out of business I think go ahead no I
said not what I said Mohammad edit that
out I don't I don't think they'll have
to they they could lower their prices
but I think what it's going to do is
their reports are going to become more
granular and again this is my personal
opinion I think that the reports are
actually going to become
longer because the people that are
asking for the reports are going to have
their own AI infrastructure to say like
cool the Report was generated please
digest it and now I'm going to have a
conversation with you to ask the things
that I normally would have asked or for
you to educate me on these things so
those short answers like I don't know
but I I don't think that the pricing
will come down I think it will probably

[33:01]
will come down I think it will probably
stay the same I just think AI is going
to cause the price of almost everything
to go down why would they be exempt so
let me say it a different way I think I
think we're in agreement what I'm saying
is they will probably charge the same
price but they will give much more in
their product one of those two things is
going to have to give either they're
going to offer the same product and
their price comes down or price is going
to stay the same and they're going to
offer way more it could also be price
comes down and they offer way more
that's what I would think the last
scenario just because I I just think
there's going to be less demand for
their product they could sell it all
they want like it's three times longer
now it's like yeah I just don't need it
anymore so if demand comes down price
has to come down but anyway so it's very
hit and miss like I posted my video
about my piano experiment on about
Facebook Marketplace and tons of people
were like it doesn't work on Facebook
for me how did you get it to work I just
I went to Facebook Marketplace and
started messaging people it it did for
me and I had to log into my Facebook
account within the operator browser and
all this but a lot of people it just

[34:01]
all this but a lot of people it just
will not work for them and I I can't
explain I didn't do a growth hack or a
trick it just worked right so it's just
buggy that's one downside it's glitchy
agreed it's
clunky yeah like slow it times out it
doesn't exactly follow your instructions
like there are there's quality control
pieces that you have to implement like
it makes it does make mistakes it's slow
like you said it's literally going at
the pace if not slower than slower a
human yeah mhm he reminds me of the
Louis CK skit where he talks about being
on a flight the first time that like
internet on airplanes was invented and
they announced they're like here on
JetBlue we now have internet on
airplanes and people logged in and they
were like oh this is amazing and then it
it broke like 10 minutes later and the
guy next to him on the flight was like
this is bull crap this is bull crap and
he's like what are we talking he's like
you're sitting in a seat at 35,000 ft
you're sitting in chair in the
sky and like there were like a half a

[35:03]
sky and like there were like a half a
dozen comments on that tweet that was
like it's freaking sucks dude it's not
worth it it's so slow it sucks I'm like
what it has to go to space like this is
artificial intelligence like week two
like what are we talking about can you
be grateful I think the I think the
other problem is they there's just a
bunch of guard rails that if they had to
put on it right they could probably
release it it'd be way faster but it'd
probably be doing some weird stuff at
some point you know what I mean so yeah
I agree with you this is this is version
one this is version one if you're
listening to this that's when you should
be playing with stuff like this you can
have an edge like that's the whole point
do you have any other cons certain
websites like Facebook like the trillion
dollar companies out there it you have
to like babysit it you can't even
navigate away from the tab there are
third party tools you can use that will
like move your mouse for you to
circumvent that but most websites it
will run in the background you can you
can run six at a time I found out but
with some of the more valuable websites

[36:01]
with some of the more valuable websites
it either doesn't work at all like
YouTube I couldn't get it to work on
YouTube or it makes you babysit it so
this is the best analogy that I can make
for operator and I've told several
people
this anybody who has a Tesla on the
freeway they can do self-driving it's
amazing oh it's so great but you can't
you got to keep your hand on the wheel
like you still need to have somebody
behind the wheel you're there if your
hand off the wheel the wheel will shake
like it will it will alert alert danger
while Robinson Chris freaking bought
this like weight thing from Amazon to
put on his steer was it an ankle to put
on his steering wheel so that it was
like oh it'll trick the system into
thinking that my hand still there so
it's like that's what operator reminds
me of a lot right it's like you still
got to sit behind it you still got to
make sure that it's doing its thing it's
gonna ask you it's gonna make sure that
you're paying attention blah blah blah
however so I'm just switching from the
cons to the pros
however anybody who's had self-driving

[37:01]
however anybody who's had self-driving
on in their Tesla you've seen the future
you know what's what's coming that's
like oh this is going to happen like
yeah this is annoying right now yeah I
got to put me hand in the steering wheel
but full self driving is going to happen
when I got my Tesla two two and a half
years ago I had to do all those things I
bought it for full self-driving and it
didn't work well at all like I used it
2% of the time and my app tells me that
so it's not an exaggeration I bought an
ankle weight my friend Keith had like
this fancy little weight that he put on
it and I went to buy it it was 150 bucks
like I'm not doing that ankle weights
were 10 bucks but it's still so that got
around like the having to put my hand on
it but it still didn't work it was
unreliable but today today you don't
need your hand on it at all ever you
just need to be looking at the road
every now was that right yeah that's
gone and it works amazingly like it
works my car drives itself now the one
thing I hate about it is I can't look at
my phone it won't let you cuz the

[38:00]
my phone it won't let you cuz the
camera's watching you that sounds silly
but like I want to look at my phone when
my car is driving me around and it won't
let me so whatever do you do
self-driving not on the freeway CU there
was a time where it was only
self-driving on the freeway you can do
self- driving off of the freeway now too
yeah I I've been able to do it anywhere
since I've had the car it was just
glitchy both on and off the freeway but
now it's not glitchy anywhere really
yeah it's legit how can wh how does weo
get around it because like who posted
about the James Camp maybe he took a wh
ride the other day and there's like
there's no driver it's all autonomous
why is weo able to get around that but
you're not is it Texas is it like local
it comes down to lar weo has lar and
that's like A1 to $200,000 investment
per car in addition to the cost of the
car Elon has said from day one lar is
unnecessary it's too much it's Overkill
it's redundant when really he's biased
like he can't sell $200,000 cars so lar
has to be irrelevant right yeah I was G

[39:02]
has to be irrelevant right yeah I was G
to ask is it a pride thing is he like oh
dude it's freaking we don't need it bro
it's just a bias thing but they have
like these Benchmark tests now like now
that full self- driving is a thing and
weo is by far the most accurate like the
least amount of collisions per million
miles traveled Tesla Is Not Great
compared to so like ldar gets you the
safest self-driving car or ride possible
but wh's owned by Google right yeah okay
I was gonna say Elon should just buy
whmo integrate it into his company yeah
but Google's not gonna sell that crap
have you seen Whos out in the wild yeah
no personally no I have I live in Idaho
dude I know like I don't think they they
get like people in Idaho see a wayo they
be like oh what the heck is that thing's
driving
itself ah return to the aliens Karen get
your gun when we went to California
they're everywhere and I saw a stat I
need to look this up I knew that San

[40:01]
need to look this up I knew that San
Francisco allowed it and I thought that
San Francisco's municipality had granted
it access so I still think that there
are local ordinances that are going to
allow or disallow these self-driving
vehicles to operate so like it'll still
be a patchwork approach for a period of
time because there's going to be cities
that are like San Francisco that are
like cool yeah you can be self-driving
and then cities like Dallas that may be
like no screw this you can't have this
in our city but right I want to say
there's like 15 or 20,000 Whos on the
road today it's it's a lot more than you
think no way Mo it's a ton it's a ton
all right so like that was my analogy
with operator the Tesla thing is I've
seen the future like I can't unsee what
I've seen as clunky as it is it can
click into things it can pull data it
will go to different websites and you
can like you're you can see that oh okay
this is going to happen like this is
it's not just pie in the sky and it's

[41:00]
it's not just pie in the sky and it's
and it's going to happen faster than you
think unfortunately we're all biased
because elon's been saying FSD was
coming for 15 years and it's like still
not here bro what are we doing oh yeah
AI is probably going to be the same way
it's not going to be the same way it's
iterating at a much faster rate than we
have ever been used to so like this
15year time Horizon like shrink that
down to 18 months until this is probably
fully operational so that's how I feel
about operator all right so that's
operator deep research I play with deep
research more than you've played with
deep research you play with operator
more than I play with operator I like it
here are the cons on some things it
takes forever a week ago let me just
explain what it is you can tell it hey I
want you to do research in these areas
and bring back some market analysis for
me and you can be as specific as you
want so I gave it some parameters I'm
looking for these types of health
facilities in this State this is the
revenue size go to this website to

[42:00]
revenue size go to this website to
validate it go to this website to pull
this information put it into a table
identify who's on public who's private
this was over a week ago I still haven't
gotten the report so like I could have
put that together in probably a day or
two I still haven't got the report so
I'm like what the like how is that not
put together and I've every day been
going and like hey any update on this
it's like this information is important
and we want to make sure that it is put
in the right format
that anyways that's a con like it can
take a long time because it's it's still
pulling a lot of information the other
con is less about the technology and
more about just the user in my opinion
unless you've gone through like a PhD
program and you understand how to
conduct research and how to put together
these reports and so you're you're
pulling correlated and non-or correlated
data and you're looking at causation Etc
it's kind of hard to tell deep research
to do something in a way that's going to
give you the most value out of it so I
would like to see some type of an airace
on deep research it's it's doing this

[43:00]
on deep research it's it's doing this
but not enough where it's like what do
you want to learn okay I want to learn
about opening up saunas near gyms cool
and then it just asks you a million
questions not a few but like a lot of
questions to get really granular on what
you're looking for so I would say that's
the con from using it one thing I wonder
about deep research is is the length of
time it's taking to find your report
going to be correlated to the quality of
what's in there do you know that yet
don't know because I haven't seen it
yeah and I specifically asked it to do a
report that I've done in the past cuz
that I know takes a lot of disparate
data sources and sort of puts them
together to build what I'm trying to
build like I'm trying to build basically
all of the providers in a specific state
of health so healthcare providers in a
specific state with their revenue from
different Revenue sources and I've done
that before pulling from different
websites because and I want to know if
they're public or private because if
they're private they're more likely to
sell than if they're public so I've done

[44:01]
sell than if they're public so I've done
this before so I asked chbt operate or
deep research to do it because I just
want to know how good it is and once it
gives it to me then I'll be able to like
look this is what I did this is what it
did let's compare the two and if it's if
it's good or like 90% of the way there
my mind will be freaking blown right but
I just haven't gotten that yet to be
able to validate it I'm curious to see
how it is because I mean either it's
going to be amazing or you're going to
be disappointed for the time it spent
and it it it might have just like hit a
glitch and just stayed there for a week
you know finally getes up on it right
the pros on it
are you have an analyst like most of the
time you'd hire an analyst 50 $60,000 a
year out of college and they're just
going to do a bunch of research for you
you now have an analyst that can go and
do the research as well as a fresh out
of college analyst so and it puts it in
a format that is digestible that you can
read you can ask a follow-up questions
questions and it'll answer it really
quickly so it's it's a really cool

[45:01]
quickly so it's it's a really cool
product if you're just trying to get a
quick approximation or a quick up to
speed on how something
works so for that reason I really like
it like I could see you using it for a
ton of your content right like hey I'm
I'm researching above ground pools in
Witchita Kansas help me understand the
market like I could I could see you
using that and then going and making a
video of it you know what I mean because
you know the questions to ask it and
it's going to give you a lot more
analysis than typical JT would I asked
it to find the list of the top 10
episodes from Greg eisenberg's podcast
and my first million uh by views and who
their guests were so I can go snag them
as guests as well like that's something
I asked Kamal to do yesterday yeah and I
want to see if it can do it for me but
it's it has problems with YouTube you
know so I don't know all right why don't
you give your Pros on chat TBT operator
real quick so so it's super good for
doing like very low skill base level

[46:02]
doing like very low skill base level
research for instance I had to go I had
to travel last week and so I said find
me a hotel in city name within five
miles of this exact address with four
stars or more under $150 or not and it
did and I watched it I watched it on
Price Line and it fil it set filters it
thought of a couple things that I didn't
even prompt it to think of and boom like
that's something that an executive
assistant would do and then I just went
in and booked it and it it could have
done that for me so that plus like find
me a Toyota Tundra 2015 within a 100
miles of my ZIP code under 100,000 miles
under
$30,000 and so it will save you like 10
minutes there and then you can like and
it will go a step further and start
messaging people but the more you ask it
to do the more it kind of glitches out
but it's really really good for doing
stuff like that and then for notating
stuff like that in a Google sheet it's
great app bottom line is we're early
I think if you can afford it start
playing around with it agents are going

[47:00]
playing around with it agents are going
to be a thing because by the time agents
become usable if you're trying to get up
to speed then people like Chris and I
are going to be way ahead of you so I
just get educated now well and don't
take its answers at face value like push
back on it as much as you can like it it
solved the capture for me but then it
wouldn't submit it and I it it still
wouldn't but I kept asking like no
submit it submit it capture what do you
mean it's solved a Capa like the ones
that have the weird wordsap sorry yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I thought that
was kind of basic like I'm like At first
I was amazed I'm like oh my gosh I solve
the capture and then I went and asked it
and I was like is capture solving a
thing like because you can do it
manually there are like capture farms in
Indonesia most people don't know this
and if you're running a bot the Bots
can't get around Capas so it will
literally pay people in Indonesia like
three cents of Capa to manually solve
them remotely oh my gosh that's a thing
but I asked chat GPT 40
if like solving captures has been around
for a while like via Automation and Bots

[48:00]
for a while like via Automation and Bots
and it's like no this is brand new so it
solved the capture for me and then I'm
like okay now enter it and it wouldn't
you know it didn't it had a guardrail
all right what you think please share it
with a friend and we'll see you next
time on the ker office
