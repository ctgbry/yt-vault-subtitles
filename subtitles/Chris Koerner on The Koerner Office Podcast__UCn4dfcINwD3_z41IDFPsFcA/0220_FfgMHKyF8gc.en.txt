look at this freaking guy right here so
I just discovered this new piece of
Hardware that gave me a brilliant
business idea that I want you to copy
but first I want to tell you how this
Hardware plays into it so let's say you
want to start a business that sells
firewood or barbecue smoking wood well
you've got to cut down a tree then you
got to wait 6 months so that wood can
dry out or you can spend tons of money
to start a kiln so you can dry it out
more quickly but now this Hardware
enables you to attach a portable Kil to
a 20ft shipping container bringing your
cost down by 90% why this is cool is
because I own a tree trimming business
so I know the industry if I were you I
would scrape every tree trimmer in my
area I would text them all and say hey
stop paying to take your branches to the
dump I'll come get them for free and
this is what I call negative cogs
negative cost of goods sold because the
cost of your product you're about to
sell is zero or they will even pay you
to take it so they don't have to pay the
dump I explain this business idea in
great detail on my latest YouTube video
on the ker office it's free enjoy please
