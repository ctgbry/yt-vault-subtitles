all right I'm here in Athens Greece at
one of your stereotypical souvenir
kiosks here and it's kind of funny what
I witnessed this is your business if 101
for the day there are dozens of these
kiosks all across syntagma Square here
and they're all about the same price and
they're all selling the same crap
imported from China via Alibaba okay I
wish I owned a kiosk here at this Square
because you know what I would do I would
Market my Prices 3 to 5x with all of my
competitors were and here's why these
customers that you see here they are not
price sensitive they're going to the
first souvenir kiosk that they see based
on wherever their hotel is they're not
shopping around they don't know what the
market price is the kiosk owners sure
know where the market price is that's
why they're all cheap that's why they're
all priced the same I would be this is
350 you could probably get it for 350 at
all these places I would be $15 because
people don't know what it's supposed to
cost so you can make three to five times
as much money you might lose 10 to 20%
of the customers but you net out way
ahead and you do way less work follow me
