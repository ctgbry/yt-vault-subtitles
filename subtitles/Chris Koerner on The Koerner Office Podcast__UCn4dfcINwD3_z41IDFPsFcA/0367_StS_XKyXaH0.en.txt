[00:00]
that could be money like that could be a
really good business first of all this
should be everywhere like to me this is
a no-brainer anywhere where games of
skill are legal this would crush and I
also think this basically takes the Dave
and Busters of the world and dude this
could be a thing like this could really
be a thing you want to build the Easy
Bake Oven of record players the other
best part about this too
[Music]
is did you see my tweet about the
hole-in-one challenge business I saw yes
definitely saw the headline you tweeted
it during politics season and I think I
it got lost somewhere else dude this
went so viral like 12 13 million views
across platforms really yeah it's this
Random Lake called Lake Topo or Tao in
New Zealand that has this little kiosk
right alongside the road you got a kind
of a busy highway and then like 30 feet
and then a lake and in within that 30
feet there's like six golf tees and a
little wooden kiosk with an iPad and

[01:01]
little wooden kiosk with an iPad and
they have 111 yards out they have a
floating golf tea on a platform and you
it's about a dollar per ball and you
just you try to make a hole in one 111
yards out part three and statistically
speaking amateur golfers have a one in
12.5 th000 chance of making it okay and
like that's an amateur golfer so like a
kid or casual golf for maybe one in
20,000 and then it's like kind of weird
it's like on the water so maybe it's
moving a little bit anyway they have a
Hoin one on average once every two weeks
two week and but yeah once every two
weeks consistently interesting and so
that's 240 Grand a year uh in prize
money paid out 260 grand and I'm betting
that they do about the same in profit
what's the prize money when you get it
in 10 grand sorry yeah Grand so if
there's if it's a 100 if it's a one in
12,000 shot and we're assuming that
those odds scale up their margins are 2

[02:01]
those odds scale up their margins are 2
200 2,000 right roughly wait what do you
mean on what sorry did you say that to
hit it in it's a one 12,000
odds if you're an amateur golfer if
you're a pro it's like one and 3,000 but
is amateur is not like an off the street
golfer that's like someone who like
golfs regularly right okay which I'm
sure there are people that try this that
golf regularly but I would think most
people are like the top golf crowd so I
think I think that's the question right
like it's it's realistically probably
than what one in
25,000 that's I said one in 20 like in
my video that's what I guesstimated okay
which at that number then it's like 650
Grand a year Topline 260 of that is
prize money so now you're at 400 you pay
one employee like they're probably doing
two 300 a year not bad not bad yeah
pretty cool first of all this should be
everywhere like to me this is a
no-brainer like it probably cost $5
million to open a top golf vers what

[03:01]
million to open a top golf vers what
does this cost 50 Grand 10 grand 5 grand
not much at all you don't have to buy a
lake you don't have to buy land you
could lease this cheaply I think this
should be everywhere I'm curious if I'm
even going in the wrong direction here
what is the legality of this because the
first thing that comes to mind is like
damn every
gambling this this week alone I bet on
the the election in Robin Hood like same
I add it too R in Robinhood was the
easiest bet ever oh my God I was like
the free money but everything is getting
gamified you know like like gamified and
and able to win and I know one of my
buddies he got into a business a couple
years ago it's technically like the
legal term is called like games of skill
or something like that yeah I we just
gonna say that you know about this yeah
so there's games a chance games of skill
games a chance slots Blackjack whatever
games of skill supposedly means that
there is technically someone out there

[04:00]
there is technically someone out there
who could never miss on this on this
golf thing right and games of skill are
legal in the state of Pennsylvania which
is I think where he was doing this thing
before so I would say anywhere where
games of skill are legal this would
crush and I also think this re this
basically takes the Dave and Busters of
the world and turns them into like adult
friendly casinos right like you're
you're taking what was Vegas which is
I'm going to sit down I'm going chain
smoke a pack of cigarettes I'm going to
order 10 Diet Cokes and I'm going to try
to blow $ thousand dollars on Blackjack
and hope that I make it big and you're
saying no let's take people who want to
gamble money and want you know the the
feedback loop of that but put it into
areas where there's actually more
entertainment that isn't just the
dopamine of winning chips right and so I
think you know the the example that
comes to mind for me too here is like
fair games or like down in the Jersey
Shore like you walk along a boardwalk
and like you can you know trip toss the

[05:01]
and like you can you know trip toss the
ball on the thing you would like stuffed
animal whatever but like essentially
harder versions of that and figure out
what the odds look like and then give
yourself a house Edge every time just
use math yes right and that's what one
of the commenter said he's like this is
stupid because what if you get someone
with a hot hand and you you go bankrupt
and I'm like that's statistically
impossible it's it's literally
impossible you know like it's just it is
like there's a reason have one every two
weeks for 30 years straight now because
that's how statistics works you know I
Googled it while you were talking about
games of skill and it looks like in the
four biggest states Texas California
Florida New York it's legal and then in
like in some of the really small states
it's not and then I think everywhere
else it mostly is but couldn't you just
frame this like even at at Top Golf like
I went to top golf with my kid and you
know I paid 60 bucks for an hour and if
you give if I give Capital One my email
address and I'm

[06:01]
I get it one of the holes it was e to
get like did it and I give Capital One
my email then I have a chance to win X Y
or Z like what is the difference there
what 100% right no no I I completely
agree with you I also think like this is
where you can you want to talk about
like the nil side of things how many
athletes can you get that basically like
turn into Dude Perfect where it's like
if I can hit this full court shot with a
baseball bat I'm Gonna Win $5,000 and
everyone goes out so like I think the
thing I love this idea I think the only
downside I can see to it is you need a
lot of space if you want to make
multiple versions of this right and what
what you're saying off the highway 40
yards whatever like that's money that is
perfect every time I think I wonder if
that is the best use of it or can you
find versions that can go off of the
casino model which are still fun and
entertaining and feel sport-like but
take up less space dude I'm just so
distracted because you said something

[07:00]
distracted because you said something
that triggered me and it's like you said
off the highway like you said something
that I said but then I thought about it
in a different way when you said it and
it's like you said off the highway right
there it's money like picture all the
interstates in America you know I75 I15
whatever how many times do they go by a
big lake or a body of water that's
privately owned how many of those have
Billboards like Billboards I've
purchased Billboards I've rented
Billboards on the highway it's not as
expensive as you think it's like $4 to
$700 a month oftentimes month to month
and the vinyl banner is included in the
price okay so you could put one of these
Platforms in a lake you could lease that
that tiny slice of land and the tiny
slice of Lake from someone who probably
hasn't even seen the property in years
so he's not going to charge you hardly
anything put up some Billboards you put
a little shed or a kiosk these freeways
interstates get 30 to 200,000 cars per
day that's the whole marketing plan
that's the whole business people are

[08:01]
that's the whole business people are
primed with a couple Billboards like
bies right like they're primed for miles
and then it's like boom right here arrow
pointing down that could be money like
that could be a really good business no
I like that a lot I feel like can you
franchise it would then be my next
question I think so okay we we have the
exact game the exact system it's called
money golf whatever it looks like we'll
we'll do the full Dev we get a maybe
maybe we split at 50-50 the the cost you
manage everything that way they're they
have skin of the game and now your next
problem becomes can we find cheap land
in areas with high drive by traffic that
I like that yeah big franchise
opportunity in the games of games of uh
skill category well dude I wrote about
this in my newsletter yesterday but you
could like you could do this business as
a service you could go into a
neighborhood like an
HOA in Texas every neighborhood has a
big lake or a big pond or dozens of them
and you could literally the sounds
sounds ridiculous but the analogy I use

[09:01]
sounds ridiculous but the analogy I use
in my newsletter is you know Phil Knight
was using a waffle iron to make his
first shoes he was selling out of the
back of his Pinto so who cares you could
they have on Amazon like 10 by10
floating platforms you could go buy for
150 bucks anchor that sucker down put a
fake green down and you could do this as
a service and just charge a percentage
of Revenue you could just charge UPF
front once you could maintain it for a
monthly fee like it could be a
self-served kiosk right like put a
little vending machine up it just senses
the balls those already exist swipe your
card there's a sensor in the hole you
could buy that from Amazon when sensor
is triggered then that guy gets paid it
doesn't have to be 10 grand it could be
a 100 bucks it could be 50 bucks it
could be an Amazon gift card it could it
could be a draw that pulls people to a
neighborhood to anything you could do as
a I like it yeah I feel like golf is the
is an obvious example are there other
styles to this that are as accessible or

[10:01]
styles to this that are as accessible or
interesting
like my mind immediately jumped to a
hunting like a shooting range that
wouldn't fly dude dude no like this is
so SAS statistics is a service okay you
roll up into a neighborhood people play
basketball at this court all the time
and you say hey I've got a thousand
bucks to anyone that could make five
three-pointers in a row oh I can do that
I could do that and you just you just
use math you just use statistics that's
it okay the average guy off the street
How likely is he to make a three-pointer
say 20% twice in a row it's gonna be 5
percent three times in a row it's gonna
be 1% right so five in a row it's going
to be
0.5% of making it or whatever it is you
got to pay it's $5 to play it's just
like a carnival game it's it's 100% a
carnival game the other best part about
this too is you're combining two things
that guarantee virality it's Sports
challenges meets big money prizes every

[11:03]
challenges meets big money prizes every
time it works right meets Pride meets
like ego so I I was going to say the
famous quote I don't I don't think it's
I don't think it's a buffet quote
somebody somebody had it which is like
the lad's attacks on the stupid or
something like that it's like I wouldn't
say that this is attacks on these stupid
necessarily right like it's it's
gambling and like you think you can do
it whatever but like definitely more of
a tax on the cocky or tax on the ego but
it's great because like they don't have
to win right they're having fun right
exactly like they're they would pay
money to go play golf anyway exactly
right yeah the the activity right this
is if you take out the money that you
can make from Blackjack slots whatever
people would hate it like you're sitting
there pulling a lever you're dealing
cards and like maybe you get the rush of
winning but like if the chips aren't
real eh kind of boring like and you pass
time poker's fun because it's just an
excuse to catch up with people but like
this already doesn't have money
associated with it and now you're adding

[12:00]
associated with it and now you're adding
money so like it it makes it way more
fun yeah I think the the trick would be
finding um the challenges that sound
really easy on the surface but are
statistically very hard it's better
better fair games yeah Fair like all I'm
thinking about is like throwing a a ball
and trying to knock three blocks off a
shelf or like tossing a ring over a
bottle like stuff where I'm like ah with
a bucket of rings I could probably get
one but yeah
and the hard part would like with my
rolling up in a neighborhood example you
need volume like that's also how
statistics works right like you're GNA
roll up in a neighborhood charge $5 to
five people and then pay out $100
because one guy happens to win that
doesn't work where's where's your the
YouTube video that you made about this
again where like where was that it it
was a short it was like four or five
days ago I'm sorry I mean I mean like
was this in Texas was this in Dallas oh
like the original company doing this
it's in New Zealand oh

[13:00]
it's in New Zealand oh
see so so I would figure out what their
traffic look like and how they're making
it popular and like I like DFW suburbs
like people make money off axe throwing
so you can probably probably make more
money off this dude like when I started
writing about this every now and then
you know I talk about a lot of ideas
it's like I kind of want to run outside
and try this right now myself because
it's so is so good you can do I am
jealous that living in in DFW like like
that area you can do the more more
physical stuff I have the same thoughts
all the time with service businesses in
particular then I flip my camera around
here and you just see Manhattan Skyris
is all behind me and I'm like ah
probably like but that's it's not like
you have less opportunity in Manhattan
no no no no you definitely have more but
like the issue is and maybe this is an
ego thing too like I don't want to get
out on the street in front of my
apartment with all of the guys
definitely Department Selling Stuff
alongside the street and be like hey who
wants to buy my knickknacks and then my
girlfriend walks
she's like this is what you do all day

[14:00]
she's like this is what you do all day
and it's like I'm there's a there's
there's a misunderstanding dude funny
story about that so I did you ever see
my post about the guy in New York Ro
Time Square that has the 360 photo yeah
so I recycled that I made a reel about
it for the first time like a month ago
and I recycled it on Twitter and the
real the real did like a million views
or something and the guy in the video
someone sent it to him and he dm' me and
I didn't see it I don't I don't check my
DMs and then he found my phone number
and he called me and he texted me and
he's like bro I got to talk to you like
you got to take that down you got to
take that down I'm like what so I I
called him back we spoke on the phone
and it had been like a year and a half
since I had seen him and there was no
communication since so I'm sure he woke
up to all these DMS and like that
probably wasn't fun all right if you are
watching this clip right now you are
watching this on YouTube and if you are
a fan of podcast please check out my
podcast while you're at it because
sometimes I have podcasts that aren't on
YouTube and sometimes I have YouTubes
that aren't on podcast so check out the

[15:00]
that aren't on podcast so check out the
ker office on any podcast platform or
you can go to TKO pod.com also my
newsletter will throw that in there
there are no ads It's weekly it's
different content than my podcast and
YouTube newsletter. chrisj cerner.com
You'll see the link and we'll see you
there he's like dude you got to take
that out I'm like why like I literally
everything I said is factual I asked you
if I could post it like you loved it
went viral a year ago you loved it he's
like well because I don't want people to
know I make $2,000 a day because then
like people I'm not the owner which I
think is a lie and he he was just
nervous like he just didn't know what to
do and and so then he went back like he
completely did a 180 on the phone he's
like actually just tag me just tag me
I'm like yeah I don't mind tagging you I
don't care I I didn't know you were on
Instagram so I tagged him and then like
it kept going viral and then he dm' me
again he's like I changed my mind man
take it down like I don't like it I'm
like dude you stop man I wonder if's I
wonder if he's afraid that like five
other people are show up with the same
thing as him in Times Square tomorrow

[16:01]
thing as him in Times Square tomorrow
maybe I I did get a DM from a guy that
started it in Puerto Rico based on my
tweet and he's like I just made $1,000
today that's pretty cool I still get
messages shout out if people are
listening to this and they're one of the
people messaging me I still get messages
on The Daily about the botox uh idea
that we had talked about a couple months
ago and yeah to to anyone who's
listening to this that is still
messaging me about it I I kind of just
want to put you guys all in a group chat
because like I realized I don't have the
time to do more right now and you
guys should all still do it but it can't
be me so okay that's good to know all
right and we have your info in the show
notes here's an idea for you I'm gonna
put you on the spot so record players
you see my tweet about that
nope okay so I have a record player it
was sitting right behind me but it's in
the kitchen now and I I never listened
to it I've had it for 10 years I have
some records but for whatever reason a
couple weeks ago I pull out a record emo
record from 20 three I start playing it

[17:00]
record from 20 three I start playing it
my kids just like come here in the
office like what is that oh it's a roord
player how's it work I'm like let me
show you pull up a YouTube video it's
like what it's like there's notches and
grooves it's freaking cool it's quite
amazing that we invented this thing
first of all we invented the technology
for record player like in the 1800s or
1700s but there was no way to play the
music until the 1900s that's crazy like
yeah like this dude put a bunch of
charcoal on a piece of paper and then
blasted sound at it and like noticed a
correlation between the waves and the
sound and so like that was the big
unlock but he had no way of actually
playing that back for like another 200
years right crazy and so one kid came in
and he's like oh can we listen and like
this is music that I play on Spotify all
the time same songs and like some of
them like it some of them don't but on
the record player they're like and they
never left my office and I was like oh
my kids want to hang out with me and
then another kid comes in oh what how

[18:01]
then another kid comes in oh what how
does this work I'm like show them the
same YouTube video the other kid and
like all four kids are enamored by this
record player and it was like light bulb
there's something special here like
there's something special about music
that you can see that you can feel
that's not just on Spotify and I
realized like this is IR you know this
is no respector of age or generation
what is the opportunity here do you have
and I went to Amazon I'm like record
player for kids and there's like a fake
record player for two-year-olds to like
bang on and put in their mouths as
they're teething and that's it there's
got to be something there right do you
think that the opportunity opportunity
is record players or the Nostalgia and
like technology P because I think any of
the above I think it feels like the
latter more and I feel like even like I
remember growing up being a kid and like
my dad would take me to like the Thomas
Edison Museum in Jersey whatever and
like we to see like all these cool
inventions and like see like Alexander

[19:00]
inventions and like see like Alexander
Gran Bell like the first telephone stuff
and that was really cool to me as a kid
and I think like if you're a curious
individual and you like the building and
the stem and like how things work that's
the cool part right like if you I wonder
what the interest level would be if you
never played the YouTube video you're
like oh it's just a box that plays music
and I'm busy and I'm doing my thing
would they have stuck around no maybe
not but I think they stuck around
because you're like I'm gonna show you
how this thing works and I'm gonna walk
I think they were interested
irrespective of the YouTube video okay
cuz like once I saw they were really
curious and interested then I showed it
to them but like they're just watching
it spin and the needle and like and
they're not like these aren't like
threeyear olds 8 10 12 14 you know so H
I don't know because I'm I'm thinking
too like I I've seen stuff before that
um like there are lights I think you can
buy them on like like teu or something
like that uh definitely definitely a
Chinese product where the lights change
based on the music and this is to go

[20:00]
based on the music and this is to go
going back to your point on uh
visualizing things the lights will
change based on the music there are
other ones where it's like little water
uh fountains shoot up based on like the
base and the tempo and the beat and all
of that so I think to visualize it would
be super cool I also wonder like that
that would be my first response is like
selling visualized sounds or something
like that my second response would be
probably a subscription Box Company of
nostalgic Goods that you can introduce
your kids to and that would probably be
the the second thing I don't know I I I
also think that like just like the the
kits like I mean I'm bringing this back
to my own childhood like I just like to
build stuff whether it it's like the
pinewood derby cars or like a kit on
like connect you know connecting two
light bulbs together to figure out how
that all works and I feel like I don't
know if that happens as much with the
iPad era like you've got kids so you
wouldn't know okay you just just gave me
the idea okay cuz I I really I didn't

[21:01]
the idea okay cuz I I really I didn't
have like a I didn't have a period on
this thought I don't know if it's
Nostalgia because I don't even know if
my kids knew that it was an old thing
you know they just thought it was cool
you know and so I do know that there's
very few moving Parts in a record player
and so what if let me back up did you
know that record player sales record
vinyl sales have they bottomed out in
1987 the year I was born because the CDs
were becoming more popular and tapes
tapes were becoming more popular to
replace them they bought them out in '
87 uh and they've been climbing ever
since interesting they the same volume
do you
know I don't know about that I could be
wrong I don't know if they've been
climbing ever since ' 87 but they've
been climbing for like a decade plus now
sales going up every single year and so
there's there's something there and I
was talking to someone else about it and
like Polaroid cameras are making a
comeback like the pendulum is swinging

[22:01]
comeback like the pendulum is swinging
right we want something we can hold and
touch and feel and it's interesting
because it's like is the pendulum ever
GNA swing back to where it's like I just
want digital now I don't know I don't I
kind of don't think it will like it's
not like digital will slow down but this
completely contradicts all the nft stuff
but like I think physical and in person
is going to be seen as incredibly High
status and I'm thinking like I've been
thinking about content a lot like kind
of as we're jamming before we press
report here and this is going to
Sidetrack the conversation slightly but
I think people will find it interesting
and even this podcast right in an age
where anyone can have a podcast and jump
on the mic and send a zoom like this is
easy and it's accessible now if we were
in a room and we took the time and
energy to set up proper cameras get good
lighting whatever it becomes incredibly
more interesting the same exact
conversation but just seeing us both in
the same screen in the same space 100%
And also think like this goes to a

[23:00]
And also think like this goes to a
social media strategy in an age where
it's never been easier to conduct AI
generated text and soon to be like I
know it's kind of already here but like
soon to be AI generated video having
in-person photos of people doing things
like like just you walking around like
like vlogging even if that's what it is
whatever it gets to be really really
valuable versus just the home office
setup and the you know CLA and
perplexity to support on the text and
research side so yeah I I know that's
not where we're going at from like a
product standpoint but I do think that
in person and physical will be seen as
higher status the Polaroids people love
even like every wedding I'm going to now
people buy like 10 disposable cameras
and like just hand them out to guests
all the time so I do think that's gonna
be really valuable dude okay first of
all yes 100% agree reminds me of a
framework I have and every time I
remember a framework on a podcast I try
to say the word framework because I'm
using AI to pull out all my transcripts

[24:02]
using AI to pull out all my transcripts
and every time I say framework put it in
a spreadsheet because I want a record of
them all but it's like the harder way is
usually the better way and it's like
yeah you could think of all kinds of
exceptions that's why I say usually but
it's like the harder way is usually the
better way I think of this podcast it's
talking head super easy you hit record I
hit record pull out a mic anyone can do
it and the the ceiling for podcast
episodes like these on YouTube is very
low right you go look at my first
million they've got 600,000 subscribers
and their average video gets 30,000
views 5% me I have 60,000 subscribers
the average video gets 3,000 views 5
per. you go look at Cody Sanchez other
people that do out and about and I don't
know a better word for them where
they're out there like on a garbage
truck and and it it takes eight hours
and you have a film crew it costs four
grand to edit it and it's hard and it
gets hot outside it rains those videos
get millions of views even though it's a
video about a garbage truck business

[25:00]
video about a garbage truck business
yeah because it's harder it's so it's
better so totally on board board with
and I was even thinking about this to
because I was like damn it would be so
much fun like my I think my Ultimate
Dream goal would be some form of podcast
Series where it's almost like Anthony
Bourdain parts are known for local
businesses and it's like almost like
Marcus lonus The Profit but like maybe
traveling around a little bit more
action-based I think the I agree 100%
with your comment harder is better like
you have to learn how to act you have to
learn how to look natural on camera I
bet like you know for as much criticism
as like politicians get or people who
are on Like These reality reality TV
shows get like hard and so like it's
hard to look normal it's hard to like
think of something clever to say when
you're on the spot and it's the same way
that like people think that stand up
comedy looks easy till you're on stage
and so I agree with that entirely when
you want to take to the next level
inverse of that framework right it's
like to be good so to be good do the
hard thing to get started do the easy
thing
yeah because like the reality is it's

[26:01]
yeah because like the reality is it's
accessible right like like we're both
here saying hey inperson podcasts are
better they're better to consume like I
just watched a 45 minute video of Chris
Williamson and Mike isot working out in
a gym in Austin like and they're
basically discussing just they're having
a conversation I was like damn I kind of
feel I'm just like a fly on the wall in
this gym right now but it's cool it's
really cool and that's also hard to film
a podcast out at a gym I'm thinking
about it this way though too the on the
status side inperson stuff physical
consumer stuff is seen as high status
online probably low status in person to
a degree like if I see a girl vlogging
and like taking an excessive amount of
photos in person I'm like that sucks
that seems really annoying whereas if
they're you know very discreet about it
they do it behind closed doors whatever
like still seen as high in person maybe
like not as distributable online yeah I

[27:03]
like not as distributable online yeah I
don't know that's a random tangent but
but it's interesting to see how it's
going so one funny side note and then I
gotta actually get to the idea of the
record player because I I think I have a
good one but based on your feedback you
watch the office yes two of like the
best funniest throwaway moments or lines
came from Aaron the redhead that was
dating Andy right so she she gets the
you said disposable camera she gets it
she takes all the pictures and she
throws them away she's like I still
don't understand how this works it's
disposable so good right and my maybe my
all-time favorite non- Michael Scott
quote was when Aaron was talking about
previous jobs and she's like yeah I mean
I used to work at the express Taco Bell
but then they upgraded to a full service
Taco Bell and I just couldn't keep up
it's just so good so good that's good so
there so that's my funny anecdote now
back to the idea okay record players for
kids here's what I think it should be so

[28:00]
kids here's what I think it should be so
record players have very few moving
Parts they're very cool and sample size
of four kids put that aside I guarantee
you that this is not just a ker family
aberration that kids think record
players are cool they move they have
grooves they play music how does this
play music it's just a needle on a thing
how is that possible okay I think
there's a world where you could find a
very simple cheap record player in China
someone's already making it and you
could reverse engineer it maybe it's
it's as like grunt worksh as ordering
them in bulk taking them apart and then
repackaging them in like a package for
kids and then it's like build your own
record player and it's literally like a
few screws you know cheap disposable
screws it all comes in one package they
build it themselves so they own it and
then they plug it in and it's awesome
and they love it but here's the money
maker all right license it with Disney
maybe yes but not where I'm going with
it the money maker is they buy the

[29:02]
it the money maker is they buy the
records from you like there're a certain
size like they want Taylor Swift it
comes from you like there's something
about it to where it has to be like they
have to buy specific records that can
only come from you for the recurring
Revenue so I can I can put a title to
this segment if you want you want to
build the Easy Bake Oven of record
players oh there it is there's the hook
there it is
easy bake oven for record players record
sales are $2 2.17 billion Doll Market
kids love them vinyl enthusias are
coming back I think doing that and then
combining any form of Licensing rights
that you can with like you know I don't
know your kids but like you know you get
Elsa from Frozen on one of those records
and that is a slam
dunk dude oh that is so good like
they're going to listen to it because
they built it they're going to listen to
it it because it's cool and even if they

[30:00]
it it because it's cool and even if they
didn't build it it's cool and then
they're going to want to buy records for
it because it's cool in four different
ways and then they're gonna have to buy
them from you Yep this could this could
be a thing like this could really be I'm
not gonna lie I didn't love the idea
until we got to that final element
record for kids specifically I'm
wondering how much how valid this is
beyond your family but but like based on
the way you're talking about it I like
it a
lot yeah oh man this is good this is a
good podcast this is what I like where
it's like you just kind of you start
with like here's a thought and then you
end with something really cool to recap
we got Easy Bake up and of record
players we've got Hoin one golf good pod
yes it's good man thank you for coming
on all right what you think please share
it with a friend and we'll see you next
time on the ker office
