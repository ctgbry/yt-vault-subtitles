I just stumbled across the most
brilliant product idea that anyone could
copy look at this right here this is a
Porsche engine block rebuilt into a
coffee table it was listed as an auction
with a $0 starting price and sold for
$5500 there were $427 Watchers and it
got $300 views that means demand here's
how I'd copy this business idea first of
all people are very nostalgic about cars
it doesn't have to be a Porsche it
doesn't matter about the makan model
this is a high dollar price point but
it's also heavy which is a good thing
because you can palletize it and ship it
anywhere in the country for $200 to $500
which means you can bake the shipping
price into the cost of the product you
can get Salvage engine blocks for $0 to
$200 you can create content around
restoring the engine blocks which could
easily go viral drawing attention to
your product before you're even done
building it you could net $10,000 per
month if you made one of these per week
not to mention get the full business
plan here
