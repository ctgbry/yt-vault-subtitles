look at this freaking guy right here he
sells a product in hundreds of grocery
stores and it is the most dead stupid
simple thing you've ever heard of here's
what he does freezes grapes and then
puts them in a Ben and Jerry's type
container and sells them for 2 to 5x
what other frozen fruit costs how why
what who would pay for that I want you
to remember this phrase I'm about to
tell you for the rest of your life
tattoo it on your forehead never forget
you can just do things that's it how
many people did this guy talk to before
launching his business and they said
what are you going to do what's your
business I'm going to freeze grapes and
sell them that's not a business that's a
snack I think it'll work okay kid he
does the same thing with blueberries
mango strawberries guess what you can
already buy all this stuff at the
grocery store it's nothing new or
Innovative what's different about it is
the framing the packaging the price
point in the marketing angle he's
pitching it as a healthy alternative
crappy processed foods he's not just
pitching it as any other frozen fruit
for all those millions of people out
there that thought or still think that
this is a dumb idea because it's too
stupid too simple this guy just went out
and did things you can just do things
