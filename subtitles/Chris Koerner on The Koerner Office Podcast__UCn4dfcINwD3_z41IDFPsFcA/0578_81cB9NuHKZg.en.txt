look at this freaking thing right here
this reminds me of one of my favorite
quotes it's better to ask forgiveness
than permission when I was in undergrad
I had an iPhone repair store one day I
took 200 flyers and taped them all over
campus on the benches and the vending
machines and the walls a week later I
got an angry call from the University
and they said hey you can't do this this
pulled the pain off the benches and I
said day 52 of Genius business ideas
follow for more sorry won't do that
again but I already had thousands of
dollars worth of sales from those exact
Flyers this idea is genius because no
one's going to reach up there to take
those stickers off just like these
Bandit you see way up on the telephone
polls that stay up for years get all my
business ideas right here
