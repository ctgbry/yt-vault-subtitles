guys what are we doing here there's a
brilliant use case for AI that none of
y'all are using look how many freaking
views this video has that is demand
which side of the equation do you want
to be on do you want to be the guy
sitting in his room generating fake AI
videos and sharing them on social media
just for dopamine and clicks no you want
to be the guy generating fake AI videos
and sharing them on social media so you
can use them as market research to
launch and or build and or sell actual
products or Services we've never been
able to do research and development this
freely in the history of the world and
video generation is doing to business
idea validation what 3D printing did to
expensive costly prototype manufacturing
don't just use it to write stupid songs
use it to get rich here's all my AI
ideas for free
