all right let's learn about an escape
room business hi Chris to a quick
questions one I read that you're waking
up always early 5:00 a.m. and starting
to work already for me that would be
really a hassle do you believe in the
early birds and night Isles or how do
you see that in the work environment
second one we have an escape room based
in Belgium and I think you would have
some crazy marketing or marketing hack
IDs to make it more lively and creating
some Buzz around the city where it's
located maybe you have some ideas on
that have a great day all right I don't
know how to pronounce your name so I
won't try but awesome we've got a caller
from Europe here two questions am I a
night owl am I an early bird the answer
is yes neither one both I don't know
sometimes I stay up really late if I get
in a flow State sometimes I wake up
really early if there's a lot I need to
get done that day it's about 50/50 I'm
not super opinionated about either one

[01:00]
not super opinionated about either one
do what works for you I rely on caffeine
heavily and they say it's not good for
you I know people trying to quit it but
why would you ever quit caffeine I mean
come on I notice zero negative downsides
I don't notice any downsides to caffeine
I'm sure they're there I don't know
about them yet ignorance is bliss so I'm
going to keep drinking my 250 milligrams
a day or so next question you have an
escape room in Belgium creative growth
hacky marketing viral stunts you could
pull to grow your escape room what a
good interesting thought-provoking
question I love these Instagram accounts
I see of people hiding money across a
random City they'll take a $50 bill
they'll put it somewhere random like
under a brick and then they'll just take
a video panning just in the immediate
area and then they'll post the exact
time it'll say like Austin Texas 2:37
p.m. first to find it gets it and these
videos get hundreds of thousands of
views they get more views than people
than there are in a

[02:00]
than there are in a
Texas so you could totally do something
like that put like a QR code or a
cryptic symbol somewhere in Belgium I
don't know are you in Brussels and post
it to your Instagram page or you could
find local influencers and send them
mystery boxes where they have to do
stunts or find Clues to even open the
box maybe it's a box with a a lock box
or combination on it and don't even ask
them to post about it just send it to
them for free spend $2 or $300 making
five or 10 of these things and then see
how many of them post organically and
how much traffic does that bring to your
business or your website and then scale
it from there if the numbers work I saw
this Instagram video where someone
printed out these flyers that had a QR
code and it said I know you cheated on
me well now the secret is out it was
just that text with a QR code and then
when you scan it it just directs to a
local business's Instagram page do
something like that I feel like Escape
rooms are pretty well established at
this point there's got to be good
examples of competitors you have even if
here in America that have grown through

[03:01]
here in America that have grown through
viral methods like these great question
either way all right let's go to Kate hi
Chris this is Kate from Australia I have
a really similar combination of toxic
skills to you I'm extremely impatient I
have a thousand ideas a day I love
starting businesses but I kind of
realized after 10 years of doing this I
don't love running them I love coming up
with them I love ideation I love putting
it all together and I love thinking
about how great it could be I have
typically never founded a business with
a co-founder really I think what I need
is amazing operational people that can
sort of take the Baton for me and run
with it I really would love to have
information on how you spend your day
ideating creating I don't even know how
many PTY LTDs I have I'm from Australia
it's like I also have a toddler that I
homeschool and I do you truly believe

[04:00]
homeschool and I do you truly believe
that the the day becomes what you make
of it how do you create operational
success when you're ideating and someone
needs to run it oh Kate your question
gives me tingles is such a good question
I love it so much and I'm glad there are
other weirdos out there like me so first
of all you need a Kirk in your life
who's Kirk Kirk is my very close friend
my business partner my cousin my partner
at Texas snacks our biy business man if
every crazy wacko like me and Kate had a
Kirk in their lives there would only be
billionaires in this world okay here's
what it takes this is an interesting
framework that I I'm obsessed with no
one will love your idea like you love
your idea kind of like kids ideas are
like kids we love our kids we think
they're freaking awesome they can do no
wrong that's how business ideas are
that's why you should tell everyone
about your business idea because they're
not going to steal it cuz they don't
love it it could be an amazing idea they
might actually freaking think it's a
genius they might think the best idea

[05:00]
genius they might think the best idea
they've ever heard but there's a
99.9% chance they won't steal it because
it's not theirs they didn't think of it
they didn't give birth to it they don't
have ownership of it they haven't put in
the sweat Ed Equity it takes to really
build an amazing idea so that's both a
good and a bad thing it's a good thing
because you should share your ideas
there is a small chance it will get
stolen but I wouldn't worry about it but
the bad thing is when you go to find a
partner that's supposed to be an
operating partner you got to sell them
on your idea and they got to buy into it
ideologically maybe even literally and
that's really really hard to get someone
to do how do I know this because I have
a freaking hold Co called co-founders
decom where we partner with operators
and we say hey here's some ideas and we
give them three for that reason because
we know that we cannot force them to
love an idea so we give them an option
of three they get to pick this maybe
it's tree trimming okay awesome and they
might fall in love with this idea but
guess what James my partner in the tree
trimming business he was at my my house

[06:00]
trimming business he was at my my house
right here in this room just last week
we were talking we spent half the day
together just working and he said Chris
I would have moved here from Ohio to
start any business trees cool H fact
cool newsletter awesome doesn't matter I
just wanted to be in the game I wanted
to riff with you on ideas it didn't
matter to me so even though he picked
tree trimming he would have picked
anything okay which proves my point even
more and James I love you so it's almost
better if you find an operating partner
that already has their own idea now I
know that kind of sounds like it's
defeating the purpose because you need
someone to run with your idea that you
gave birth to and that you love but what
you can do is you can take their
business idea and you can fall in love
with customer acquisition ideas 0o to
one is not just taking a business from 0
to one it's taking a customer
acquisition channel from 0o to one a
sales Channel an employee from 0 to one
you can have different quote business
ideas inside a parent business idea if
that makes sense does that make sense

[07:00]
that makes sense does that make sense
and so you need a Kirk you need to find
someone that you know love and Trust
even if you don't know them today you
need to find them you need to seek after
them and meet them they need to be the
yin to your yang the Kirk to your Chris
they need to be the ones to take it from
1 to 10 and you need to be the one to
take it from 1 to 10 now that is hard
because I've come to Kirk a dozen times
over the last few years say Kirk let's
launch this let's launch this let's know
that and guess what he doesn't have
entrepreneurial add like I do so he's
like oh whoa Chris Texas next is
actually doing great there's so many
things I want to be doing here it's
growing but I have so many ideas I want
to implement like I am all in on this
one business I don't want to start this
random business with you because this
one's going great am I going to argue
with that no so that is kind of an
inherent problem with finding your Kirk
is they're only going to work want to
work on that one idea but it's also not
a problem because if they're still
working on that one idea it means that
idea is working quite well so tiger
don't change the stripes you are who you
are Kate don't do what I did and go give

[08:00]
are Kate don't do what I did and go give
$100,000 to TCU in an effort to be more
organizational more corporate get your
MBA lean into who you are Outsource your
weaknesses leverage your strengths say
with me Outsource your weaknesses triple
down on your strengths and that being
0er to one and find your Kirk so video
is cool but you know what's better long
form audio via podcast and my newsletter
TKO pod.com go there to subscribe for
free to my newsletter it's one email a
week very tactical and then go to my
audio podcast three episodes a week
stuff like this you're going to love it
all free no sleazy sales TKO
pod.com okay Laura next so my question
is around I'm thinking about building a
Super Hyper local Facebook group
newsletter and podcast that I can
monetize with ads and sponsorships from
local businesses who will want to get in
front of this targeted growing list so
my main question is what would you do to
WRA rapidly grow the email list Facebook

[09:01]
WRA rapidly grow the email list Facebook
group and the sponsor and AD revenue and
then as a followup an additional
question is what other service might you
suggest offering local businesses say in
the AI automation area that I can mostly
offload to the suite of tools that's in
go high level or other you know kind of
Integrations like zapier I'm tired of
working with high workload clients but
still want to be able to offer a service
that's easy to scale to local businesses
who maybe are in that Twitter AI
business bubble that we online nerds are
all in so thank you so much can't wait
to hear what you think Laura what a
beautiful question I hope by now you
listened to my Q&A episode a week before
today last Wednesday that would have
been episode number 124 I believe
because I went on a 15minute rant about
newsletters okay so go listen to that
one if you haven't already okay I might
be telling you stuff here you already
know I don't know how much you've
listened to my podcast but if you don't
already do this you need to go to

[10:00]
already do this you need to go to
Twitter and follow creating Jos
J he has a local newsletter in Edmonton
or Calgary Alberta Canada he's doing
great he's crushing it and then you need
to follow life ofor scoop and that is
Ryan sneden of the naptown scoop in
Annapolis Maryland those are the two
local newsletter Gods you may already
follow them but if you're listening to
this and you don't you should they're
much more knowledgeable in local
newsletters than I am but as I said last
week to be fair to you you left this
question like a month ago long before I
recorded last week so as I said last
week it all comes down to paid ads
Facebook ads and Facebook groups because
you're in a local area you're building a
local newsletter you can acquire
customers for free in Facebook groups
because you're one of them you're one of
your customer base therefore you have
trust and Authority see if you can buy
some local Facebook groups oh man talk
about cheap those are the cheapest
Facebook groups you can find because how
many people in the world want to buy
Connect New York's local Buy sell garage

[11:00]
Connect New York's local Buy sell garage
sale Facebook group exactly zero people
almost none of these local groups are
monetized you can use something like
group boss to collect email addresses at
the door you can sponsor yourself you
can be vertically integrated I would
definitely do that aside from that I
would just do meta ads on Facebook and
Instagram to people in your local area
you might have to pay a little more
because the market is very limited right
you might have to spend $2 to acquire a
subscriber as opposed to one if it were
a worldwide Nationwide newsletter but
that's okay because your cpms AKA your
ad rates that you can charge on your
newsletter are going to be two to four
times what a normal newsletter would be
because your Market is that much more
targeted and then you want to monetize
by offering a higher ticket service
white labeled on go high level very
smart if you go to high levelup.com
you'll be able to use my affiliate link
High levelup.com forwards to my discount
one month free what would you sell on
High level what would I sell I would do
like an AI like an automated call

[12:00]
like an AI like an automated call
service where AI answers calls on behalf
of the business owner that is a service
that high LEL can wh label for you or
just like an automated review request
automated review responder you could
build like a full Suite of Google
business profile Management on High
level charge $500 to $2,000 a month what
a good business idea like this is just
everything that a good business idea
should have you're vertically integrated
you're your own Advertiser you don't
have to be your own Advertiser but if
you are you'll make a lot more money
you're going to White Label something on
High level you're leaning into AI it's a
newsletter like you're combining all the
things I love about these business
Frameworks into one so you're on the
right track you're going to crush it all
right let's go to cat and hey can we
talk about the female representation
here come on loving it also don't forget
if you're listening to this and you want
to leave a question TKO pod.com scroll
to the very bottom you're going to see a
widget where you can hit record leave me
a question for me to answer on this
podcast you can make it Anonymous or not

[13:01]
podcast you can make it Anonymous or not
let's go to cat Kate then cat hi Chris
it's cat and I have a question about
crypto I have a bunch of cool URLs for
crypto like sin coin and Mom coin and
run coin and a bunch of URLs for nft
like the coolest nf.com in fact they're
allcom but I don't know what to do with
them and how to put them to use do you
have any ideas or resources I should
look at is there a making a crypto coin
or nfds for dummies that's worth eting
I'm just a stay-at-home mom with a lot
of Big Dreams and I'd like to do
something fun and document the story
along the way thanks for any help and if
it's appropriate to bleep out any of
these please do thanks so much cat you
are my spirit animal you sound awesome
you're a domain name collector just like
me it is so nice to know I'm not the
only one out there so I kind of have
some bad news for you I don't mean to
throw water on your fire uh and this is
just my opinion so feel free to ignore
it but that is why you called after all
so I'm obsessed with domain names and
I've kind of been obsessed with crypto
since 2016 here's the thing your URLs
are awesome momo.com Sim coin awesome

[14:02]
are awesome momo.com Sim coin awesome
love it like these are things I just
heard from Brian Armstrong CEO of
coinbase that I heard from him like he's
my friend he tweeted that a million
cryptocurrencies are being created every
week 1 million every week I distinctly
remember in 2016 2017 there were 2,000
total and I thought that was insane what
do we need 2,000 cryptocurrencies for
that is way too many and now a mere
eight years later there's a million
created every week but if you think
about it in a different way these aren't
trying to compete with the US dollar or
with Bitcoin or ethereum they're solving
all kinds of problems and honestly most
of them don't solve any problem but
they're more like a website than a
cryptocurrency right they may enable you
to stake an ownership claim in a Creator
or a business or a project or an nft or
whatever or they might just you know
most of them are just stupid meme coins
either way the problem with having these
domain names is that premium domain
names are not that valuable to

[15:01]
names are not that valuable to
cryptocurrencies okay I don't even need
to search and I know there's already
going to be a mom coin and a Sim coin
and maybe all of those other projects
that you mentioned and I presume because
you didn't mention it that they're not
reaching out to you to buy your domain
name now that could be for one of two
reasons number one you don't have it
listed on a Marketplace like GoDaddy or
dan.com or I forget all the names of
them there's a bunch of marketplaces
where you can take your domain names
with a few clicks you can just list them
for sale does you no harm you might as
well do that in fact I would do that
like today
because then you can actually start
getting offers for them now people can
offer you something for your domain name
whether they're listed on a Marketplace
or not but it's just a lot more friction
it's going to be harder for them to find
you unless it's listed so I'm assuming
that these token owners aren't already
reaching out to you and that's for a
good reason because what does any
cryptocurrency owner want they want the
price of their cryptocurrency to go up
okay and you could say well that means
they need a good website because then
more people will find them but people
aren't just Googling mom coin to buy it

[16:00]
aren't just Googling mom coin to buy it
that's not how cryptos spread they
spread in Discord channels and in
telegram channels and on WhatsApp
channels and on Twitter that's where
they're spreading and on Tik Tok even
and Instagram social media and so the
domain name is just really not that
valuable for these random
cryptocurrencies now if Mom coin we all
know there are examples of things like
ship Doge and fcoin and what have you
reaching tens of billion dollars or
hundreds of billions of dollars of
market caps so there is precedent for
Mom coin to be a big thing and if or
when that happens someone will come
knocking for your premium domain name so
I do not advise you to let these lapse
or expire or to sell them for less than
what you think they're worth but I also
don't think you should build a
cryptocurrency just because you have
domain name for them now if you had a
good domain name in another Niche like
in an AI Niche or in something that's
trending like water quality or
microplastics or longevity or something
like that then I might recommend

[17:00]
like that then I might recommend
building a domain name around that but
generally speaking that's what emds are
for exact match domain names like if you
had the domain name HVAC Dallas or Texas
roofing.com that's an EMD an exact match
domain name in other words people are
searching for that exact term which
makes you more likely not definitively
but more likely to rank highly in Google
search results because there's more
relevance there so if you want to
continue to be a domain named junkie
like I am keep looking keep hunting for
cool domain names but I wouldn't look in
the crypto Niche for those reasons but
fingers crossed for you that Mom coin
whoever owns that just takes off maybe
Elon tweets about it and they form a
board and that board sits around the
table and says we really need to own the
Doom we just got to own it so we don't
want to pay any more than 100 grand for
it but let's spend up to 100 Grand on
momo.com and when they do they're going
to come to cat and you're going to make
six figures all right let's go to Justin
hey guys love of the podcast I was

[18:00]
hey guys love of the podcast I was
listening to episode 78 where you were
talking about cloning people and
creating an AI bot around that and I was
wondering uh if you could dive into a
little bit more detail about
specifically U how you'd set up the
business around that how you would
partner with multiple people let's say
you want to clone 5 10 or 15 people how
would you go into business with them and
partner with them and how would you
structure the business that would be
really interesting to hear that episode
number 78 was a banger that was awesome
and I'd love to hear your thoughts on
going a little bit deeper Justin you're
the man thank you for the kind words you
heard it here first episode 78 which was
entitled how to make money by cloning
others using AI from October 14th go
back and listen to that here's what I
would do Justin I would go to creators
Community owners Community managers
influencers creators content creators
because that is a Persona that is
monetizing their likeness their image
their brand their content and they're
probably not doing it as in-depth as
your talk talk about doing with their
content so I would build an agent and

[19:03]
content so I would build an agent and
I'm only telling you to do this because
I'm assuming you have the skills to do
this because it just sounds like you do
okay build an agent using repet or
openai or whatever that let's say it
takes the last 50 Instagram reals that a
Creator posted takes the transcripts
from them and it turns it into a chat
bot and you find some automation to do
this to 20 different creators in the
background as you were 20 different chat
Bots I know I'm oversimplifying it but
by the time this comes out it'll
probably be really easy based on how
fast things are advancing and then let's
say 20 you want to take these 20
creators and you want to find as much
contact info on them as you can their
Strava profile their PayPal profile
Instagram Twitter everything email
multiple email phone number get as much
info as you can because they're getting
hit up in the DMS all the time so you
want to hit them on other avenues as
well and say hey I built a chat bot for
you I think you're going to love it it's
awesome okay well what can I do with
this well if they have a paid Community

[20:01]
this well if they have a paid Community
then it could be a feature in their paid
Community it could be another feature to
add to get more members to their
Community or you know what you could do
you could even go to like School SK l or
kajabi or collab go collab
koab or gumroad or Etsy go to any of
these places where people host
communities Facebook groups anything and
this the principle applies right this
could be a feature that the owners of
these communities or the creators sell
to their members maybe it's a package
deal with the community price maybe it's
extra maybe it's free but it's kind of
timec consuming it's especially time
consuming if you don't know how to use
agents because even if you're Adept at
chat GPT which many of these creators
probably are they're still going to have
to spend the time and finesse the
prompting and get it just right so it
doesn't hallucinate you got to make sure
it draws on all the data not just some
of it you're going to know things like
do I use Claude do I use perplexity chat
GPT they're not going to know these
things and this is a valuable thing and
you could sell it to them for a onetime

[21:01]
you could sell it to them for a onetime
package fee or you could sell it to them
for a percentage of Revenue that they're
able to resell it for but I mean you got
a lot of options at your disposal here
there's a lot of platforms out there
with communities that you can scrape and
I scraped the school communities it's if
you go to TKO pod.com subscribe if you
unless you already have scroll down
there do a control find on the Google
Doc for school SK and you will see
hundreds or thousands of scraped School
communities and it shows how much they
all make and you can start reaching out
to those owners in there and you could
say hey I'm going to give this to you
for free but for X dollar I'm going to
take all this other content that you
have within your community outside your
community from your emails your Google
Drive whatever and turn it into a
chatbot I'm going to clone you all right
and that's it for today we'll do more
Q&A here soon on the ker office please
share with a friend love you guys see
you next time
