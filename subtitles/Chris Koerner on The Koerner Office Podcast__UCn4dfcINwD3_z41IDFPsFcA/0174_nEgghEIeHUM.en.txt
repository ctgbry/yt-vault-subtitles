look at this freaking guy right here
this guy invented glow-in-the-dark
seethrough kayak tours and they print
money but if you really want to get
smart with it you'd sell these kayaks to
other entrepreneurs all over the world
and generate leads for them in exchange
for 10% of all bookings you profit on
the kayak up front and you profit on the
tours over time and it's a brilliant
model and would work anywhere with water
