look at this freaking thing right here
we all know how expensive eggs are but I
was shocked at how many eggs this
vending machine put out for only s bucks
nonetheless here's why this needs to be
a business here in the States look at
how many people sell farm fresh eggs
it's a big market look at what has
happened to the price of eggs lately
it's insane look at what the healthiest
food is in the world that you can eat
freaking eggs now why did they get this
many eggs for only seven bucks because
there's no supply chain there's no
middleman markup I would love to see
every roadside egg stand selling these
bad boys with no employees no supply
chain no extra markup full business plan
right here
