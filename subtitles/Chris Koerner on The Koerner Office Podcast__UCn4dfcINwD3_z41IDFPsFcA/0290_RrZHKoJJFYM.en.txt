this video reminds me of the used car
buying experience because it is terrible
but I have a business idea that costs
nothing to start that anyone could use
to launch a profitable business here's
exactly what you do go to Facebook
Marketplace and message all the people
selling private party cars cuz these
people are about to be buying a car as
well you're going to message them a link
to a Google form that ask them what type
of car they're on the market for because
you are going to do car negotiations and
research as a service you were going to
charge a percentage of the money saved
you'll ask them things like color make
mileage and how qualified of a buyer
they are then you're going to go do this
research online find 10 cars that fit
their criteria put them in a
standardized report send them to them
and have them pick three to five
favorites then you're going to get those
three to five dealerships on the phone
and haggle them on price be sure to use
the dealers against each other because
you will get a better price that way
then you're going to bring back the
winning car to the buyer and say hey I'm
going to charge you 30% of this $1,500
that I saved you that's $450 profit do
this 10 times a month and you've got a
$55,000 month side Hustle
