[00:00]
I think I can just stack a bag slinging
an AI rapper on Facebook at you put in a
dollar get back two 5 10 20 asymmetric
risk is like oh what happens what's the
worst I lose 5 grand but like my upside
is 30k in ARR in an asset that's worth
100 Grand it's like I'll make that bet
every dayb I'm like literally going to
drop ship software where I just spend
$1,000 to build a Prayer app a cooking
app productivity app like whatever I can
think of and just run ads monetize
everything
if you run a wedding planning business
what's the best top of funnel lead gen
to get the client is proposal you help
you get all these wedding planners are
trying to get the girls to be like all
right this is the wedding planner and
it's like dude n no n you go after the
guys of like hey help me let me help you
plan the best proposal humanly possible
and then when the girl is like
absolutely enamored with the entire
experience and she goes how did you plan

[01:00]
experience and she goes how did you plan
this and they go well actually this
company or this person helped me they
also do wedding planning we should talk
to them dude you know that's the play so
you're a proposal consultant and you're
zero dollars you're free free proposal
consultant what's the catch well I have
a network of expert wedding planners
they're already vetted they're proven
they're awesome and you just have to use
one of mine and they'll pay me on their
end and it's just a referral game yeah
and you can get a referral on on the top
because it's like on the on The Proposal
Part because it's like I might have gone
above and beyond but like for her I
would do it over and over again but like
there's layers to it you know there's
like the actual getting on the knee and
there's that piece but it's like you
have the ring itself you have the
proposal moment you have the
photographer you have the experience of
that then you have the Afterparty and
you have the restaurant with all the
friends and it's like you know if you
have those relationships it's like oh
like I'll get kickbacks from the

[02:00]
like I'll get kickbacks from the
restaurant we get kickbacks from
wherever I think you could step in and
be a free proposal consultant as a top
of funnel lead gen into into wedding
planning monetize everything yeah yeah
yeah if I've learned if I've learned
anything through this experience it's
one that I love Lauren more than life
itself and two that you can make money
in The Proposal
space the two most important things in
life those the those are the two things
I learned dud it's funny because when I
proposed and got married and had my
first kid this was 08 like it was
literally I got married in ' 08 when I
was 21 and we got pregnant in ' 09 and
so like yeah I mean I didn't have a
smartphone then I had a freaking Palm
prio like with like a Blackberry
keyboard with the little stylist dude
yeah and so do you know what like our
gender reveal looked like it looked like
me chilling in the OBS room while she
got an ultrasound and it's a boy cool
like that seems so Antiquated now like

[03:00]
like that seems so Antiquated now like
but that that's just how we rolled back
how old school of you dude dude I'm like
a boomer basically it's an antique geez
so funny what else is new oh you know
just pumping away on unlimited content
jamming on on everything that we're
doing it quicker making a couple a
couple little side plays that I think
are interesting okay we'll have to talk
about those we've touched on pieces of
it over the last couple of PODS I
rewatched one of the pods that we did
the one specifically about the The
Prayer app the pastor where I was like I
want an AI P yeah PST yeah the most
humble way humanly possible I really
what I said about it you know what I
mean let me translate that's you saying
you really liked what you said about it
I really enjoyed yeah thoroughly I know
you have to I Really resonated with my
own statement know what I mean okay but
yeah and so you know these micro
consumer facing apps I think is super

[04:02]
consumer facing apps I think is super
interesting especially as all these like
iOS leaning no code tools come into
existence and so you have your flutter
flows you have your thunes you have you
know there's a handful of these what are
those things what are those things
flutter flow is a no code IOS app
builder and so both of them are actually
thunkable is the other one flutter code
I've never heard of that flutter yeah
flutter
flow.io flow sponsor Chris and then
th.com maybe I don't know also sponsor
Chris these are specifically iOS
building yeah mobile first and so like
they when you go and and publish them
you publish them to the App Store and
the Google Play Store and so the
learning curve is there's definitely
like it's it's not as straightforward no
code as other tools but it can do more
that's just the trade-off right the more
userfriendly the less it can do yeah and
so they're they're cool I really like

[05:01]
so they're they're cool I really like
them I I met a dude on Twitter actually
after he watched he's been following me
but he watched the Pod and I got a bunch
of DMS being like I'm a developer I'm a
developer I'm a developer let's do
something he was like Hey I'm down like
I can I'm a flutter flow guy like I can
build this and I was like all right cool
so I bought a template I'll just spill
the secrets dude come on now yeah I'll
spill the secrets so what I'm what I'm
launching what I'm launching is a a
recipe a recipe directory app with all
these different types of recipes so
vegan healthy options keto right all of
these and then you get a you get a AI
powered Sue Chef in the app right and so
you can pop in you can say hey I only
have eggs and Thyme and bacon what can I
make right and it'll like hit you with
whatever like the recipe is going to be
and so I just think it's like a
mathematical equation of like the market

[06:01]
mathematical equation of like the market
the market size for that is massive like
in the United States it's like literally
everybody so I'm like all right that's
let's just say 300 million people I
think that I can probably get downloads
on the app for sub five on Facebook ads
okay that's the goal Facebook ads
Facebook ads all the way I'm GNA do
organic you know what I was doing with
the send prayers thing where I was just
like automating all of those posts same
thing I'm just going to launch Five
Instagram accounts that are like like
I'm calling it instant chef. a that's
going to be the domain Chef's instant
chef's kiss right there ah I'm still
trying to come up with a name for the
for the the Sue Chef I'm thinking like
Pierre you know like okay yeah yeah
something a little you know that's like
gonna be your Siri yeah yeah yeah yeah
Pierre you know something like that and
then so I think I can get downloads for
five bucks it's going to be a pay you
have to pay to access it there's no free
version on this app I do not want to

[07:01]
version on this app I do not want to
play the premium upsell game it's like
not what I'm here for I'm going to
do a 30-day free trial and then 60 bucks
a year 30-day free trial 60 bucks a year
okay so there so it
is but okay yes only way to access yeah
only the only way for you to access is
for you to authorize that payment okay
and so it'll be it'll be five bucks a
month right but charged annually and so
I think that that's a Vibe let's say I
can get app downloads at five bucks
which like feels kind of high like some
of the guys that I know that are running
iOS ads are getting downloads for sub 2
and so I'm like now is that free like
are those PID downlo all free
okay the the way that you do it is like
you're not paying when you download
right you're all hitting you're hitting
a pay wall post download and so they're
getting the download let's say for two
bucks okay let's say like easy math like

[08:00]
bucks okay let's say like easy math like
if I can get downloads for two bucks and
20% of those people start a free trial
that means my cost per trial is $10
let's say 33% of those people end up
actually converting so 30 bucks into a
PID so a$ CPA yeah CPA CAC for a $60
ARR so I double my money on a 30-day
cash conversion cycle a awesome super
stoked about that and then mobile apps
are trading at 4 to 5x and so it's like
cool I just turned like my $30 into $6
in cash returns plus the multiple the
multiple on the 60 let's just even on
let's just say it's three I also created
$180 of Enterprise Value and so I'm like
and it the market is so big in those
videos it's like we were talking about
on the last pod about like these DIY
videos that go crazy viral and nobody is
like capturing we talked about the

[09:01]
like capturing we talked about the
recipe thing where we were like yo like
no one wants to read your life story in
the middle of trying to figure out how
many grams of salt go in this omelet
like yeah no one cares and so I was like
all right cool like there's a bunch of
viral cooking videos there's huge
accounts in that space everybody wants
more recipes my mom has 18 cookbooks
right it's like people have seven recipe
apps like why am I not just diving into
that where it's like I don't need go
spend I'm paying this guy this developer
like $1,000 to build it that was my next
question bucks you send in my way
because I want I want him to build
something for me well yeah I mean you
can talk to me and I'll charge you 2,000
and pay him a th000 you know how it goes
discount I need that bro discount but
yeah I think like that model and I think
that there's so many different verticals
that you can do that in and so I'm
testing it with this to be like hey like
if I make a super simple and I might I
might just Target like 40y old plus like

[10:01]
might just Target like 40y old plus like
I'm not trying to like change the
cooking industry I just want people that
have enough disposable income and enough
desire to cook good stuff that it's like
they'll pay 60 bucks a year because like
if you run that math out it's like okay
cool I can get that to a thousand users
let's just say a thousand paying
customers right you're talking about 60k
and ARR you could probably go and sell
that for a quar million bucks 300,000
bucks and all of a sudden dude my
wedding is paid for you know what I mean
well and not just that but like
everything you're describing sounds so
fun like testing creatives testing
Facebook ads right that is that's like a
day out on the lake dude I've been
having a blast making the canva bolt
create of all the day one of finding a
healthy recipe for you day one of
finding vegan it's all programmatic it's
just scraping the highest performing
viral cooking videos that have hash
vegan recipe in it right and you just
pump those down turn it in pop it over

[11:01]
pump those down turn it in pop it over
into Hopper
HQ hashtag it up see what performs best
Hopper HQ is what I used to like
schedule out all of my Instagram content
like buffer or whatever very similar but
cheaper okay yeah yeah and so yeah I
mean that's really the model dude I'm
just like why would I why would I not
take I was talking to a buddy yesterday
about it and it's like I was talking
about the the transition that I've made
in the last year from being like I'm
going to say that I was very much a
creator of like I like to build the
products I like to like be in in the
Weeds on that into more of like an
allocator right as the businesses get
bigger it's not like not so much hey
what is Sam going to do with his day
that's still part of it but it's also
like who are we going to hire what tools
are we going to implement what change
like and so I've been seeing myself less
as a Creator at times and a little bit
more of an allocator when I think about
allocating energ time and money there's

[12:00]
allocating energ time and money there's
just asymmetric bets where it's like
okay I'm going to go pay this guy $1,000
all in all in let's say that my total
risk value is like four grand on the
high end to be honest like I will know
if ads will work after spending $100 a
day for two weeks yeah so like and I'm
really paying him 800 bucks it's not a
thousand so it's like you play that game
and I'm like all right for three 4,000
bucks what happens I get a fully
functioning app that's in the App
Store that I can go and try to run cool
if nobody signs up not a single person I
can essentially just sell the app for
parts put on go on air yeah literally a
flipa acquir any of those and be like
hey I have this recipe app someone
should go and run this here's five grand
like here take take it for five grand so
video is cool but you know what's better
long form audio via podcast and my
newsletter TKO od.com go there to

[13:00]
newsletter TKO od.com go there to
subscribe for free to my newsletter it's
one email a week very tactical and then
go to my audio podcast three episodes a
week stuff like this you're gonna love
it all free no sleazy sales TKO
pod.com are you doing like a a REV share
with the guy no straight path I told him
I want to do rev share with him on
future ones if we can get this one to
work for sure I'm like I'm happy with
that but it's like yeah why would I not
make that bet where it's like okay where
else can I put $3,000 in that has such
an asymmetric upside on a relatively low
risk profile mathematically it just
makes sense to like make those swings
and I'm not the one building it like I
will probably put in 50
hours where like either in the 50 hours
it either works or it doesn't yeah and
like at the end of that 50 hours it's
like either I can hire someone to run
the ads he's going to continue to manage
the app I just sit as a management layer
and collect my check or it doesn't work

[14:00]
and collect my check or it doesn't work
after the 50 hours and like I would have
been messing around building something
else anyways yeah like why would it not
be this thing that I think is like such
a move and so so you're telling me we're
just on the TKO pod riffing around on
ideas nothing planned nothing scripted
no shared notes we talk about this idea
you listen back to it you get inspired
by yourself and you go and build it with
a guy that dm'd you after hearing it as
well dude it's beautiful I'll send you
your 10% don't you worry no no I'm gonna
I'm gonna build my own thing I might you
know what let's do this let's do this in
public I'm gonna I'll partner with the
same guy and I'm G to launch I'm going
to do something more Niche than you but
same same genre and we'll compare notes
publicly on the Pod I'm G to do a
Sourdough companion app how about that
hey super Niche so the the targeting is
going to be totally different strategy
different yep and we'll see how about
that I'm not mad dude this is amazing

[15:00]
that I'm not mad dude this is amazing
first of all second of all what was I
going to say are you going to put it
like on the Android App Store yeah oh
okay I mean right I mean like it it's I
only have to click one button to do both
so why wouldn't I no off I mean 84% of
my podcast downloads are on an iPhone so
for the 16% of you that are offended I'm
sorry don't leave I'm just I'm a hater
sometimes yeah hey dude honestly it's
okay to hate on Android I'll join that
hate parade any day I have never pushed
Facebook ads to an app before but I've
been in the weeds of Facebook ads for my
newsletter and just having a blast I'm
converting newsletter subscribers at
a127 right now and then I'm pushing them
through spark Loop and getting like a do
four back it's crazy what are we doing
yeah infinite money glitch it feels
illegal yeah but like granted lot of Cav
caveats I'm targeting my current
audience on Facebook so there's already
some trust built in there I'm writing it
like it takes a lot to get to that point

[16:02]
like it takes a lot to get to that point
but oh man Facebook ads like it's just
the best mean I was doing it I was doing
it completely cold with more broad
entrepreneurship content like it was
it's probably been a year and a half
since I did it just pushing out like no
code tools directories and like little
like lead magnet type stuff I was
getting Subs on the newsletter for sub
150 also and it's like those were
completely cold audiences no trust my
face wasn't even on it it was like let
it ride two days ago it was 250 right
today it's 150 and I've only been doing
it for like 5 days so yeah we'll
probably go sub a dollar it's fun it's
so fun to get in the Weeds on Facebook
ads dude it's like best inventions of
all time fire the wheel sliced bread
Lauren AKA Sam's fiance and then
Facebook ads Facebook ads am I right did
I miss I mean that's that's literally it
dude oh you just put in a dollar get
back two five 10 20 yeah it's like it's

[17:01]
back two five 10 20 yeah it's like it's
like a it's a it's just math it's like
and I love that I mean don't get me
wrong it's not just math there's
creatives and conversions and messaging
and positioning and like all these
levers that you can pull but like when
you boil it down there's nothing like
some math dude I know you gotta run the
math what are some other fun things
you've done with Facebook ads we could
just kind of ride that theme for a
little bit man I mean tons in the Ecom
space like Drop Shipping you know back
in the Glory Days of Drop Shipping
like you know you just find a product
and a creative combo that just hits and
so done a done a bunch with that done
super well on on some of those we run
Facebook ads pretty aggressively now for
unlimited content right B2B service
where you're you're running it at call
book funnel right and it's all math
right and so it's like you're running
ads saying hey you know we to SEO for
small businesses at a more reasonable
price here's our approach here's what's
good they go to a squeeze page that has

[18:00]
good they go to a squeeze page that has
a a short vssl explain to everyone what
a squeeze page and a vssl is yeah so a
squeeze page would be basically a
landing page that exists between your ad
and your call booking page and so it's
like common practice is also to send
them directly to a call booking page we
found that the squeeze page you get like
a subtle secondary optin and so like the
vssl is a video sales letter essentially
abbreviated version of my sales calls
that like in four minutes basically runs
through the value problem like here's
what's good this is our approach if
you're interested if this matches for
you like click the button below they
click that button that says right now it
says yes I want more traffic they click
that button and then it goes to a a
callbook page okay and so it goes to
that callbook page and essentially what
we're trying to do is just run the math
right and so your your cost per booked
call right and you multiply that by your
show rate right and so you get to a

[19:00]
show rate right and so you get to a
figure that's essentially your cost per
seated
call right people that show up and so
like as long as run give or take for us
it ranges depending on the day between
60 and 100 bucks is kind of like where
we're at and so we our math works at a
100 right and so if I know that I can
get a seated qualified call for $100 and
then my closer Kyle shout out Kyle Kyle
can close at
20% right like and this is like me
trying to be conservative to make the
math work it's like obviously I want him
to close at 30% obviously I want seated
calls at 60 bucks if we can continue at
sub $100 qualified calls and he can
continue at 20% close rate that means my
my CPA my CAC for a new customer is 500
bucks total we charge 500 bucks and so I
break even on my ad spend on their first
month of service MH and we run on a more
fixed cost model versus uh an Ecom brand

[20:02]
fixed cost model versus uh an Ecom brand
runs on more of a cogs model right where
good sold yeah and so like our cogs on a
monthly basis per client are relatively
low because our overhead is higher and
so like I don't need to expand our
bandwidth or or increase my expense
structure dramatically for a new
customer because I already have a
full-time account manager there I
already pay for the software that does
it for all of our clients and so as long
as I can maintain
a $500 CAC and I can break even month
one my cash conversion cycle is a okay I
can start to scale that spend more
aggressively because it's not like I'm
not bleeding money from a marketing
perspective I'm just reusing the same
,000 every day because we make ,000 off
the acquisition every day and it's not
always that perfect sales like when
you're doing this in reality you're
thinking about sales cycles of like our
average sales cycle is 7 days and so
really we're eating 7,000 th000 to spend

[21:00]
really we're eating 7,000 th000 to spend
but then we start to make it back and so
like that's how we plan out all of our
budgeting but yeah I mean Facebook it's
just like an you just click buttons and
like more leads show up for whatever
reason more people don't like to make
money and so they don't touch ads and
it's like dude like I'm at the point now
and you know me like and a bunch of the
people that have listened we've been on
enough of these episodes now but like I
was always super building Public Super
like lead with personal brand founder Le
like let's use that to kind of like
spearhead and and do growth and now I'm
like I don't want an Instagram account I
don't want I don't want any of that I
don't really want to play this build-in
public game from a lead gen
perspective I just want to get hyper
effective on ads because like the
reality for most businesses is no matter
what if you're going to get a business
to be sizable you have to run ads so you
might as well just start running them
now
like yeah you're going to run ads at one

[22:01]
like yeah you're going to run ads at one
point like you're not going to go from 3
million in AR to 10 million in AR
without ad spend yeah I don't care what
kind of business you're in at least not
quickly like sure over 20 years you
could probably do it but like that's
tough to do with just like a personal
brand leading it it's like no no no I
want to play the math game and like run
it yeah good better best good is you
have one good acquisition Channel better
is you have multiple best you have a ton
that all feed each other 100% what would
you advise people to do if they want to
learn Facebook ads literally just start
running them I'm gonna answer my
question because I just have this idea
so I have an affiliate link for high
level right yeah and we we use high
level in our business and it's I
something I genuinely love so it's a
natur fit that's all of our funnels for
unlimited okay so by the way my
affiliate link automat it has a discount
and it automatically forwards if you go
to high levelup.com it will be my
affiliate link so high level up anyway

[23:01]
affiliate link so high level up anyway
it's 40% lifetime for everything that my
Affiliates pay high level right which
that's legit I look at it like this like
okay I now have a SAS business right
without having to build a SAS business
like y what's the hard part of a SAS
business fulfillment starting it running
it developers overhead that's all done
okay I don't have a SAS business that
can charge $100 a month but it can
charge $40 a month cuz I get 40% of
their 100 so one thing I'm testing is
I'm posting some highle shorts to all
five short form platforms and whichever
one's a banger and I I already found one
that has really good retention but a
really poor swipe through rate and so I
took the same video and I took five
different Hooks and I'm posting all five
because I like the harder part is the
retention that's checked now I just need
him to get to the retention so you test
it with five different hooks it works I
find a a banger then I just boost it I

[24:01]
find a a banger then I just boost it I
just boost paid ads behind it and then I
just watch the numbers and it's like
okay and these are like realistic
numbers uh let's say I get a click for
23 cents okay 10% of clicks convert to a
lead that's $2.30 for a lead 10% of
leads convert to a customer that's $23
for per customer the average customer
pays 99 a month I get 40 of that so I'm
spending $23 to get $40 a month after
average you know lifetime value is say
18 months I mean what are we talking
about here the math makes sense and I
don't even own the company
right right so cash on cash baby to
answer your question to answer my own
question go find an like an affiliate
program like that and just push paid ads
to another company literally okay ready
here you go sign up for go high level
I'm sitting up or I'm not to not to
diminish your relationship with go high
level but something even as easy as

[25:00]
level but something even as easy as
convertkit now whatever they're branded
as just like kit.com yeah they have
landing page templates both of them spin
it up say whatever industry you want to
be in doesn't matter whatever the
software tool is whatever whatever how
to grow on Twitter guide right you go on
chat GPT you say hey I want to write you
know a 10-page PDF about how to how to
grow my Twitter audience right okay then
you have a landing page that says the
ultimate guides are growing your Twitter
audience email optin sick immediately
when they sign up you send them an email
with the guide and links to Memel lord.
te I think they have an affiliate
program hype Fury or tweet hunter or he
mel. Tech is that like a me generation
to software it's so fun yeah. Jason
LaVine he's a sick dude on Twi oh that's
his yeah dud So Co I know this okay I
think they have an affiliate program you
can let a a hopper HQ you can you can
find 10 software tools in the organic

[26:02]
find 10 software tools in the organic
content creation space cap cut whatever
right that all have affiliate programs
like that and so then you have all of
these people you run the ads you make
the creatives using creative
os.com little shout out I got a shout
out the boys you know you make the
creatives you start running the ads you
see what your cost per email is and then
you see what the click-through rate to
all of those affiliate links are right
and it's like cool like now you have one
you're double dipping now you have a
newsletter of a bunch of people that are
interested in growing their content or
organic audience on Twitter right paired
with a bunch of people that are now
using these software tools that you
recommended and so like that to me and
you're not trying to like compete
aggressively in uh a direct consumer
space or a B2B service
space right like you're not you're not
playing the cost of goods thing you're
not playing con like the Fulfillment
game you're not you're just like you're

[27:00]
game you're not you're just like you're
a Content machine at that point and so
and you can do spark loop on that or you
can you know like literally your model
in any in any offer any interest like
doesn't matter you could do it for uh
LinkedIn growth for real estate agents
we help real estate agents do ABC and d
and like not for nothing I think that
that's the best kind of launch pad for
almost any business
is like email optin around a lead magnet
related to your offer backend
monetization spark Loop affiliate
program a b c and d and then all of a
sudden you know you spend a th000 bucks
on ads you have $800 in recurring
commissions and you have a list of a
thousand people that are all interested
in whatever your kind of offer is and
you can go after all of them with a
service and say you're a real estate
agent that wants LinkedIn growth dude we
actually
LinkedIn content for we make memes for

[28:02]
LinkedIn content for we make memes for
you and then you sign up for mem off and
you make the and you make the memes and
then you have a thing every time you
send the email you can make a hundred
bucks just based on a CPM because it's a
high value audience straight up oh man
oh like that that to me is like the
lowest lift I mean what you're all in
you're all in
expenses if you use high level or you
use convert kit is like A1 bucks a month
maximum then your Facebook ads and then
and your ad spend and you're GNA lose
money ma yeah you you have to understand
your numbers you have to understand what
your CAC is going to be you have to
understand what your cash conversion
cycle looks like a lot of the affiliate
programs pay on net 30 so you know
there's a little bit of delay on that
Revenue cool that chilling on all of
that spark Loop takes I think they're
net 15 like you know what I'm saying and
so there's like you have to play the
game and understand the the math but
like from an off
monetization model like asymmetric bet

[29:02]
monetization model like asymmetric bet
upside like I think more people should
just do that of like Niche and you don't
have to the craziest part is like you do
not have to put your face on it yeah I
was running all of those under the grow
faster branding using static ad
creatives from creative OS I it wasn't
my face it wasn't my personal brand yeah
I didn't even sign the emails from me
well dude if you really want to get
sneaky with it you could use AI
generated faces and if if people want to
buy from a human just chuse an AI human
you know how real they look now we're
like not even they don't even look fake
at all anymore just download the
captions app on your iPhone sorry for
the Android users my bad those 14% or
whatever 16 the 16% of Android I don't
know if they if they have the captions
app but the caption app on on iPhone
like you just load in your script and
they have like 80 avatars that you can
use and it costs like 24 bucks a month

music and then it shows like a dog like
