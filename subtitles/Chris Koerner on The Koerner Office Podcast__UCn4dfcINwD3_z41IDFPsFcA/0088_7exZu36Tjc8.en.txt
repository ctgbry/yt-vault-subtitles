[00:00]
if you're selling a $3 to $50 product
it's going to be almost impossible to
really scale with Facebook ads because
your cost per acquisition is going to be
about the same and so I would try
testing just stupid price points $30 $80
$150 and the same ads the same copy to
different price points on the same
landing page and it will just split your
[Music]
traffic hey Chris hey how are you man
doing good okay so you're a tinkerer
you're an engineer right yeah I would
say I'm a engineer transitioning to a
tinkerer probably so I worked
professionally as an engineer for about
10 years or so and I've always been
jealous of the maker space people
because they get to use that and change
their own lives and so I've been diving
into that over the last couple years and
in my uh little prompt my kind of like
moonshot idea is to come up with a
product that's sellable has a good
addressable market and then build

[01:00]
addressable market and then build
company around it and doesn't need to be
right
away but and you have a a W2 right now
right no right now I have a uh LLC and I
I consult through my LLC with a couple
of Aerospace startups okay so you're
self-employed as a consultant
basically yep and that that pays the
bills that covers
you yeah yeah it's pretty solid right
now I'm actually I have a little bit
more work than I ideally would have
because I would love to spend more time
tinkering and stuff but yeah it's it's a
super solid gig and part of the reason
that I'm not in a rush is I don't want
to jump into something that I enjoy less
which I think could be easy to do I love
talking to people like you
that I'll just I'll simplify it and say
you're a consultant is that accurate
enough yeah yeah because it's not all or
nothing A lot of times people have a W2
and they make a lot of money and they're
like I really want to do this but I
don't want to quit and I'm always like H
don't quit because I want to I don't
want to be the person to tell you to do
that but you have the flexibility of

[02:00]
that but you have the flexibility of
saying ah I don't really like this
client I don't really like that client
let me keep these three core clients
that it's the 8020 for me and really
build something on the side is that
possible totally okay yeah absolutely
and I I'm doing that a little bit now
I've done little Ventures and and even
actually the people that I work with are
they're like good friends so they'll
like let me get away with little
interesting ideas so one of them for
example I I do like structural analysis
and design stuff but I sold one of my
clients a whole bunch of 3D printed
parts that they wanted on a short time
frame and it was like a great return on
investment I got them to pay for me to
get another 3D printer so I could like
up my production rate and up to get all
the parts that they wanted and all this
stuff I decided not to do it again
though because I ended up spending an
entire weekend onboarding a new 3D
printer and just running the thing all
night um so I've dabbled a little bit
with stuff like that and trying to
figure out what are some other things
that I could yeah I super big fan fan of

[03:00]
that I could yeah I super big fan fan of
your podcast cuz yeah I love all the
like crazy ideas that you have but
thought it might be interesting to uh
see what happens if you are thinking of
that from like a tinkerer angle yeah no
I don't think I've ever had anyone ask
that question like a specific physical
product idea yeah totally yeah cuz
everyone wants to do SAS and and I get
it like yeah it's and there's a lot of
easier ways to make money I totally get
it but I just have always had a passion
for physical things and I've always also
had a passion for kind of trying to
improve people's lives in these like
little simple ways um something that I
just did that was funny is I got a like
a programmable outlet that you can plug
in and you can put like a timer on it
and I hooked it up to a space heater and
then so my wife and I have have been
experimenting with using like a heater
as an alarm clock which was I was like
At first I thought about that and I was
like maybe that could be a product idea
but you can totally build it with two
things from Amazon for 50 bucks really
solved but I still think there's

[04:01]
solved but I still think there's
definitely room for product ideas that
you can build with two products from
Amazon for 50 bucks because that's
friction and you're eliminating friction
is a whole business in and of itself
you're making it easy and you can even
make that the angle right like you can
make that the selling point whereas
there could be something else that does
that exact thing but their angle is an
alarm clock right that's their unique
value proposition your angle is you're
more of you're a better space heater
that also has an alarm clock does that
make sense you're just framing it
different yeah that does yeah and I
guess I couldn't buy it yeah one of the
things I thought it would be interesting
to talk to you about is uh a lot of
people that are in my position they're
looking at it from this angle where
they're like oh what's a technology I
could invent and then I could patent and
then I could license the intellectual
property uh but I think today the the
kind of like threshold of effort that it
takes to get into e-commerce is so much
lower that there's probably a whole
field of things that are not really

[05:01]
field of things that are not really
protectable from an IP side but you
could still move a couple hundred
thousand units before all the imitators
catch up and this that's a interesting
thought that you had cuz I discarded
that idea CU I think it would be
difficult for me to beat the bomb cost
of those two parts but maybe I could
just put a enclosure around like the two
two highly rated things from Amazon or
something and Market up yeah look at it
this way I wanted a light in my bedroom
like a programmable light that I could
in in our bedroom we have four recess
lights and I wanted the one right above
my side of the bed to be able to turn on
and off with my phone so my wife could
sleep and so my point is I went and
bought there's hundreds of these on
Amazon and I bought one and it has to
come with a hub so you had to plug the
Hub in on the wall over there and then
you plug the light in and that's a
little friction a little janky but I
know that it the technology requires it
I what is preventing you from finding a
box manufacturer that can make a

[06:00]
box manufacturer that can make a
different box that frames it differently
and has your brand and your name on it
and then just getting a plug and a space
heater and and then getting instructions
printed up and saying here's how you do
it you plug this into the wall and then
you plug the space heater into this and
it's you're just piggybacking off two
products that probably hundreds of
companies in China make both of them get
the ones that are the most generic
looking don't have any brands or logos
on them have them go in the same box
take a flyer on a container full of them
and see if you can move them H okay so
this is really interesting I I guess
like the short answer is nothing right
like I could just go for go do that so
some of these ideas if you need to like
inventory $5,000 worth of parts that's
like that I could handle that it would
hurt a little bit if it all went nowhere
it just I guess not really I'd have to
figure out what to do with all of them
so it's like stuff like that I'm I don't
have the China the like China
manufacturer connections yet I haven't
done I don't know like third party

[07:00]
done I don't know like third party
Logistics or first party Logistics like
what it it sounds like you lean towards
with this one if we did if I did try
this idea just buy all the stuff put it
in a closet at my house and then go
around and try and sell it around town
basically so if I were you I was trying
to think of this as you were
talking I would not take a flow in a
container because that's going to be way
too much money so forget I ever said
that um I would just go to alibaba.com
and just start dming manufacturers of
these two different products and get
them to send you samples first of all
they'll usually do that for free so
you're at zero Z find a space heater and
a a plug like it's just a smart plug
right that you like and get a dozen of
them most of them will probably be free
find two that you like then find someone
in the US that makes custom boxes
they'll probably be $1 to $2 a piece get
the minimum order quantity of those
printed call it 100 or two so you're at
a few hundred bucks now and then order

[08:00]
a few hundred bucks now and then order
the same quantity of each the plug and
the space heater and then just print up
some simple instructions assemble them
in your house store them in your closet
and then go to Amazon and find out what
it takes to ship them minimum quantity
of items and they're going to want you
to label it specifically it's kind of
friction it's a lot of headache but once
you do it once you can roll any product
into that same account and then you
label them correctly you ship them off
to their distribution centers and see
what happens and it's obviously you've
got some time because people aren't
going to be bu space heaters right now
so that buys you six months to really to
nail the timing on when people are
actually shopping for these things and
in the meantime list them on Facebook
Marketplace list them on Craigslist
people will be looking for used space
heaters so they'll find your just by
nature of the search term they'll find
your new space heaters on Facebook
Marketplace you can do that at any time
like you could list that right now and
see if there's demand for it and then
it's just like the Facebook Marketplace
isn't really going to be scalable
because it's it's mostly local unless

[09:01]
because it's it's mostly local unless
you it could be if you do paid and and
you boost it and you ship but I wouldn't
you're using Facebook Marketplace to get
some feedback on the idea and on the
product and then I think it would also
behoove you to make a video that you
could plant with an influencer of some
sort just like a 20 to 30 second video
of just showing how it works and I'm
picturing you could even like you watch
the
office yeah so it's like that episode
where Michael Scott puts the George
Foreman grill by his bed because he
wants to wake up to the smell of bacon
and you could superimpose that in the
video somehow and it's like that except
for a space heater and I think that
would do really well on social media but
you'll need to find someone that already
has a presence and just say hey can we
take a flyer on this video that's fair
fair use right yeah I I I don't know I
don't know but better ask better to ask
forgiveness and permission but nice and
then find one person with 50 100 200,000

[10:00]
then find one person with 50 100 200,000
followers and just say hey I'll give you
10 bucks from everyone you sell most
people will ignore you someone will say
yes and see if you can use the social
media angle as well because I do know a
lot of people that have sent a random
product to Amazon and just made a ton of
money they're also survivorship bias and
people that have never sold one you just
don't know totally have you ever looked
at jungle
Scout no I've never heard of jungle
Scout check out jungle Scout it'll
enable you to do a a ton of research on
competing products and they will tell
you with reasonable accuracy how many of
those products that that every company
that's awesome it's really cool yeah I
was literally like just wondering how to
get this data it's just basically like
sales data for Amazon products yeah I
was just I was like on Amazon and I was
just like I was like I guess they
probably don't want to like yeah I don't
know how jungle Scout figures it out but
they do that is dope that is really cool
yeah I love these uh suggestions what do
you think about combining Amazon listing

[11:03]
you think about combining Amazon listing
with social media so if we if cuz the
the Amazon Seller like approach is nice
because it's very hands-off so I just
have to get my whatever their minimum
quantity is ship it off a couple times
to get a couple distribution centers and
then and then I don't have to keep them
in my house or mail it myself or
whatever so that's really appealing but
and then it I would think that I could
still do a micro influencer campaign and
then just have people link to my Amazon
page and then additionally I think
people are pretty comfortable with
Shopify websites now as long as that's
like the payment layer and everything
but Amazon's another way to make people
feel comfortable giving their payment
information and I know at least for me I
have a bias towards things that show up
on Amazon because it feels like it I
feel like I can trust the logistics more
you're correct but forget trust for a
minute because what makes Shopify such a
behemoth is the fact that you can really

[12:01]
behemoth is the fact that you can really
push paid Facebook ads to these websites
and we'll talk about Shopify for a
second I would go to upwork find someone
that can make a one product Shopify site
and they have one product Shopify themes
too because it's very different to sell
one specific product as opposed to just
having a Shopify store that sells even
two to 2,000 products and it's a
different look it's a different feel you
want like countdown timers you need some
apps widgets so find someone don't
reinvent the wheel pay someone four or
500s
that can make a onepage Shopify site
that's optimized for specifically for
Facebook ads and then use an app a
Shopify app that can ab test your price
points not enough people do this they're
like ah it's not really a clean way AB
testing yes yeah I yeah already sold
here's the thing if you're selling a 30
to $50 product it's going to be almost
impossible to really scale with Facebook
ads because your cost per acquisition is
going to be about the same and so I
would try testing just stupid price

[13:02]
would try testing just stupid price
points $30 $80
$150 and the same ads the same copy to
different price points on the same
landing page and it will just split your
traffic and then see how that does I
wouldn't count on Shopify this can sell
well like there's so many not to offend
your product dumb items out there that
people make I threw this one out cuz
it's a dumb one I figured this one can
go in the air oh there are things like a
little little cutter that like you take
a pie and it's like a better pie slicer
and how often does anyone eat pie they
make tens of millions of dollars because
people are stupid and they buy stupid
things right and it goes viral on Tik
Tok or Instagram so this is actually a
utility like we need to stay warm in the
winter it's better than just a normal
space heater I think you could do energy
right to have it kick on only when to be
awake yeah that's one of your selling
points yeah yeah I gotta make I could
check and see if I didn't check super

[14:00]
check and see if I didn't check super
hard to see if anybody was already
selling this but you know it passed the
five minute Google test it's probably
not going to after the podcast oh I
don't know no I would do this though for
real and let us know how it goes okay
that's cool and then so what do you
think about the single product Shopify
page versus try to come up with maybe
three similar throwaway product ideas do
them all at once uh jump up into this is
like jumping into bigger scale you think
that that it's most of the effort is
getting one thing set up so that I
understand the processes or do you think
that like everything that I add is going
to be a lot of extra
complexity it just depends on what types
of products it could be a lot of extra
complexity but if you're in the same
industry or if if you're just importing
space heaters for one idea and the other
one you're like 3D printing a a model
and then you're finding molds in China
That's they're almost two completely
different things so I lean just starting
with with this just to learn and then

[15:01]
with with this just to learn and then
ideas two through three will go so much
quicker because you'll have learned so
much but if you have seven months until
winter then maybe do try two at the same
time if they're not too
complex okay yeah right now my like
prototyping lab is in storage because
I'm like house hunting and we like move
States and stuff and so it's a better
time for me to try this like fully
external type thing import a space
heater import a timer find a
company that will do a casing for it so
are actually do you know any places to
look for us manufacturers that are
interested in these types of things what
I was Googling before is I was I found a
few companies by looking for injection
molding with direct shipment but
injection molding is more High run it's
expensive did you have you were thinking
maybe of some 3D printing companies or
something like yeah have you looked at
thomasnet no I haven't I've heard of it
though yeah I would check them out
there's that's a a great resource for

[16:00]
there's that's a a great resource for
all kinds of stuff like this okay yeah
that's awesome yeah yeah yeah this been
super interesting yeah and and really
fun it's yeah it's I I've listened to
every episode of your podcast so far
this was funny out yeah I've been like
imagining this conversation for a couple
episodes so well hopefully I didn't let
you down no not at all not at all this
was really fun cool best of luck uh
Clayton and follow up please that's all
I ask is that you follow up and let us
know how it's going
yeah I will do all right man have a good
one you too see you
