a few years ago something terrible and
unexpected happened I had two business
partners we owned a business worth $10
million and we had a $50 million deal on
the line and right at the last minute
they pushed me out of the company and
betrayed me it was one of the hardest
things I've ever been through I spent
some time vulnerably telling this story
on my YouTube channel in the hopes that
it will help someone else and I didn't
just tell my side of the story I told
their side of the story against me as
well because there's always two sides so
if you know anyone that's been through a
partnership Horror Story please share
the YouTube video with them that's
linked in my bio and I hope it helps
