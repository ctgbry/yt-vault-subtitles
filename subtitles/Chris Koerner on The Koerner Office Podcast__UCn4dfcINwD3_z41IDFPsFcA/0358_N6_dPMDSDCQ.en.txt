look at this freaking thing right here
I'm going to tell you what this is
called but first I'm going to tell you
how I'd make a bunch of money with it
first of all these things cost a lot
less than you think they're on Wheels
they're portable and you could set them
up at anywhere with walkable traffic
there's nothing people love more than a
picture of themselves that's why this
will always sell underneath the machine
you could have four to six different
types of frames at the ready because no
one's going to want to buy just a burnt
leaf with their picture it reminds me a
lot of this product here which makes 3D
printed figurines after a full body scan
but I like this one a lot more because
that one costs a lot more than this
little laser and it requires a lot more
space and time and it's just very bulky
but I love the fact that they're both
similar Concepts there's basically zero
variable cost because you're just
plugging up anywhere you are it only
takes a few minutes to complete the
picture and you can charge 30 to 50
bucks for these pictures order your
frames by the box from Ali Express and
go to Etsy looking for picture frames
and sort by the ones that are the best
sellers and buy knockoffs of those that
way you don't have to guess what people
will love this machine's called a 40 wat
K40 and you can find them here follow me
