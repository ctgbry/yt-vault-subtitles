Why would you pay Salesforce thousands
of dollars a month when you can build
exactly what your business needs or your
customers businesses need [music] for a
fraction of a fraction of a cost? It's
exactly what you need for pennies. It
helps you look like a nationwide brand
for next to [music] nothing software. If
I want the Jobber account that has like
the SMS functionality, it's like 4 or
500 bucks a month. It's crazy. And the
vast majority of businesses might need
three [music] of Jobberers's hundred
features, right? They're paying for all
this stuff that they don't even use.
This could be free. This could be your
lead magnet. This could be your foot in
the door to start charging them for
other stuff. Totally.
&gt;&gt; The same logic can be applied to so many
industries.
&gt;&gt; All right, Brandon. Well, thank you for
coming back on the pot.
&gt;&gt; Thanks for having me. Excited to be
here.
&gt;&gt; Okay, so what I've done is I have asked
Chat PT, give me all of the vibe coding
tools. Boom. Done. And then I'm going to
share my screen. I just Googled random
word chooser. Okay, here we are. And you

[01:00]
word chooser. Okay, here we are. And you
can just enter in a list of words. You
click choose and it's going to pick one.
So, there's a lot of vibe coding tools
out there. A lot of them are about the
same. You and I, what we're going to do
on this episode is we're going to
perfectly randomize a vibe coding tool.
Pick that. And then we're going to
perfectly randomize an app to build with
said vibe coding tool. And then we're
going to build it at the same time. So,
the same app on the same tool at the
same time, but with our own brains, our
own background, history, experiences,
prompting, and then see who spits out
the better product at the end. How does
that sound?
&gt;&gt; I'm excited.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Cuz you and I are both vibe coding
afficionados.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; And we're okay at it, you know, and
we're not coders. We don't have a coding
background.
&gt;&gt; I don't know anything about code. I
think what this video will serve to do
for at least some people is show you
what can be done in minimal time without
expert prompting engineering, you know,
strategies.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And you know what, Brandon, I'm
just going to get on the soap box for a
minute. We see all these tweets about

[02:01]
minute. We see all these tweets about
like, "This prompt will change your
life. Be sure to prompt chat GPT just
like this." And it's like 3,000 words
with like, "You are an expert resource
for me. I'm trapped in an Iranian
prison. And it's you don't need to do
all that. Like just like garble together
a like a poorly worded sentence riddled
with typos. Ask it to do something and
then just go from there. Like don't get
hung up on how perfect your prompt needs
to be.
&gt;&gt; Hold on. Has somebody said the Iranian
prison thing? Cuz if not, that's
amazing. The only way I'll get out of
this prison is if you if you code this
perfectly for me in the next 30 minutes.
Well, [laughter] I saw one Palmer Lucky
said that like his trick to get Chad GBT
to do what he wants is to say like
you're like a university professor
that's been
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; in incorrectly accused of impropriy with
a student
&gt;&gt; like your life depends on the output of
this prompt or something, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I said that.
&gt;&gt; Those are fun sound bites. It's just not

[03:01]
&gt;&gt; Those are fun sound bites. It's just not
necessary. Just talk to the dang thing,
you know?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure.
&gt;&gt; All right. So here are the vibe coding
tools. We got bolt, replet, emergent,
cursor, chipt, and then we just click
choose.
&gt;&gt; I think what it's doing is it's picking
like the blank lines. Maybe I just need
to remove the spaces. Let's click
choose. All right. Emergent. Have you
heard of emergent?
&gt;&gt; I've heard of them. Never used them
though.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Well, let me let me ask chat GPT
real quickly for a few facts about
emergent. What is emergent? Let's see.
It is only platform in competition to
rank twice number one globally in
benchmarks for coding agents. One of the
fastest growing growth tools. It looks
like they've raised a couple rounds at
like insane valuations.
And Agentic no platform lockin. One
thing they have different is it looks
like you don't need to use like
superbase for your database. It's like

[04:00]
superbase for your database. It's like
they have their own built-in superbase.
So, I think there's like less
integrations you have to do.
&gt;&gt; Sounds cool.
&gt;&gt; Now, it sounds cool. Now, let's go ahead
and I've had chat GPT generate a bunch
of app ideas because we don't know what
we're going to build here. All right,
here are some choices that chat GPT spit
out for apps that we can vibe code.
Roofing quote bot, landscaping estimate,
dog grooming reminder app, yada yada
yada. You get the idea. We'll click
choose lawn care biz quote generator.
&gt;&gt; Sweet. Okay.
&gt;&gt; Okay. I guess that's what we're
building.
&gt;&gt; I'm going to a merchant right now.
&gt;&gt; So, we're each recording our screens,
but we're obviously looking at our
screen. Let's see who can build it
fastest and who can build it best. With
emerging, it looks like we can choose
our own model. So, that's another you
and I can decide. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. That's cool.
&gt;&gt; All right. Ready?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm using the Iranian prison

[05:00]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm using the Iranian prison
thing. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; I'm in an Iranian prison. Okay. You are
not You are free. You're in Texas. I'm
in an Iranian prison.
&gt;&gt; So, there's there's one differentiator.
&gt;&gt; We'll see how this turns out. All right.
You ready?
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Go. And this is with the free account.
&gt;&gt; I signed up. It's 20 bucks and it was 10
bucks off. So, I just signed up for the
10 bucks.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, both of us got the $20 a month
plan, but we're welcome to choose
whatever model we want to choose or
prompt it however fancy or simply that
we'd like. And uh should we go?
&gt;&gt; Let's go.
&gt;&gt; Okay. All right. Here we go. Okay. So, I
just finished my first prompt. I pressed
enter 30 seconds ago. It told me that
it's going to build it. And now their
agent is asking me a few details to
clarify what I want. So I'm going to
review those and see what I need. Okay.
So the details it asked me are pretty
good. It asks it wants to clarify what

[06:00]
good. It asks it wants to clarify what
services specifically am I offering? How
should the quote calculation be
designed? How should quotes be managed?
Whether it's instant or is it more of
like a lead form thing? And then if I
have any design preferences on how this
little web app, this little website
thing is going to look. So, I'm going to
answer and I'm just going to say mowing
and hedging are going to be my services
okay, quote calculation. How to
determine the price? Yes. Square
feet or acres.
Service frequency. Good call. Whether
that's, you know, weekly, every other
week, or monthly. Quote handling. Uh,
I'm going to do instant quote display
and a lead form below that on the
results page. Also, my contact

[07:00]
results page. Also, my contact
information so they can get a hold of me
if they want to. Fun fact, 80% of the
people that watch my YouTube videos are
not subscribed to me. And most of them
think they are. They see them in the
feed, but they're not subscribed to me.
So, please, it'll take half a second,
just click subscribe, and it would mean
a ton to me. For anyone watching, a
famous one that people like to say is
sort of like use the aesthetics of
Airbnb. Airbnb is like a super famous
Well, everybody knows Airbnb, I'm sure,
but they're well known for just being a
very welldesigned, pretty, you know, app
and website. So, I'm just going to do
that one for fun. I'm going to say model
it after Airbnb style, but with
different colors. I'm going to do greens
cuz lawns should be green. Okay, let's
see what happens. Also, the waiting
screen uh very much has Matrix vibes, so
it's kind of fun.
&gt;&gt; My original prompt is now officially
sent off and it's working. What were you
going to say?
&gt;&gt; So, I gave my prompt and then it asked
me questions. I answered the questions

[08:00]
me questions. I answered the questions
and then it's been working in the
background, which obviously if I was
doing this, I don't have to actually be
watching the screen while it's working
in the background because emergent makes
nice little noises. So I can just come
back and check when I hear a noise and
do something else, you know, check my
email, whatever, while I'm waiting. So
just a little side note there for
people.
&gt;&gt; It is nice.
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; I like that.
&gt;&gt; Okay, you go then. I'll be ready cuz
mine just gave me an output. All right,
it just asked me four clarification
questions and I just answered those. It
took about a minute to send me those
questions back. Now it's working again.
&gt;&gt; Mine gave me its first output. It looks
good. It does have the vibes of Airbnb
like I asked for, but with greens. So,
that's nice. It looks looks pretty. It
looks simple, which is also what I want.
It said that it gave me the front end.
It took some screenshots, as you can see
on my screen, to show like how the quote
process would work if I were to go
through it, which I will. It gives me a

[09:00]
through it, which I will. It gives me a
nice little recap. And then it gives me
sort of a, you know, just the details of
what it did. It says I created I won't
read it all but it said I created the
front end only version of your quote
generator using mock data that reflects
Airbnb with the green you requested and
then it shows me what is working the
quote calculator the instant quote
display the lead form business contact
info and then the site and then it notes
which is good because some people kind
of forget about this the pricing logic
is currently just with mock data and
doesn't have any you
real thing to go off of yet. So I
because I didn't give it any dollar
number of any kind. So I'm going to have
to do that and I'm going to start
testing it just to make sure it actually
works. Also, if you see on my screen, it
lets me choose as a as a user, you know,
the square footage or acres. So I can
choose either one. And then it says if I
want lawnmowing and or hedge trimming.

[10:03]
want lawnmowing and or hedge trimming.
And then it also asks if it's going to
be a one-time service, weekly,
bi-weekly, or monthly. So, it gave me it
it set it up to where the user can have
all those options.
&gt;&gt; That's pretty cool. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, is yours kind of like a chatbot and
not like a form?
&gt;&gt; No, no, it's a form.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; But it's like a dynamic form. So, that's
good. So, I just did a test and so I
just I put that my lawn size is 600
square f feet. I said I wanted mowing
and hedging. I said I wanted it weekly.
It gave me the quote, which is $7.80 per
service because it doesn't have any real
data. So, obviously, I need to change
that because I would, whoever would do
this would be losing money. It shows a
nice little breakdown of what's included
for that $7.80,
the form below, as well as contact
information.
So, I'm going to now work on adjusting
the pricing logic so it spits out
correct pricing here. Also, for anyone

[11:03]
correct pricing here. Also, for anyone
noting in the top right of my screen, I
started with 11 10 credits in my account
here.
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; With Emergent and I'm at 109.67.
So, I haven't even used one credit
total.
&gt;&gt; 67. Okay. So, on my end, it was
basically saying like, "Hey, what kind
of a database do you want?" And I'm
like, "Uh, just Google Sheets." And then
it's like, "Okay, how do you want to
integrate Google Sheets?" And like, I
mean, for the purposes of this video, we
want to launch this fast. I was like,
"Nah, never mind.
&gt;&gt; Just email me the lead." And then it was
like, "All right, do you want to use
Send Grid? Do you want to use SMTP or
whatever?"
&gt;&gt; And then I started to log into my Sen
Grid account because I have one and it
wanted two-factor and I was just like,
"Nope, too hard. No integration. Just
generate quotes. Yeah. So,
&gt;&gt; okay. I mow my own lawn, so I don't know
how much lawns cost to um mow these
days.

[12:00]
days.
&gt;&gt; Okay. I've got a quote here. I did not
give it any design specifications. Mine
says lawn care quote calculator. It's
green, I'm assuming, cuz it's lawn care.
It asks for full name, phone number,
property, acreage, and house square
footage. So, now I'm going to test it
and see how it goes. Okay.
Okay.
Interesting.
So, mine worked perfectly. It did
exactly what I needed needed it to do.
&gt;&gt; It's awesome.
&gt;&gt; Now, the math, like I need to adjust the
math, and I'll get to that in a minute,
but it works. So, I'm going to keep
tweaking it. Since I didn't do this
earlier, I just put in the pricing. So,
I just chose 50 bucks per thousand
square feet of mowing. And then I told
it to adjust for smaller or larger lawns
&gt;&gt; and to adjust for to you know change to
acres and do the calculations for that
if needed. And I said that that's for a
onetime mow. I said if they want hedging
too just add a 25% additional cost. And

[13:02]
too just add a 25% additional cost. And
then I told it that if the customer
signs up for monthly instead of one time
they get a 5% discount bi-weekly an
additional 5% discount. and then weekly
an additional 5% discount. So, it's now
adding in that pricing logic and it'll
give me the updated version shortly.
&gt;&gt; I like that. How many credits are you
at?
&gt;&gt; 108.37.
&gt;&gt; I just feel like with these vibe coding
tools, customization is going to be the
name of the game. Like why would you pay
Salesforce thousands of dollars a month
or HubSpot or whoever when you can build
exactly what your business needs or when
you can build exactly what your
customers businesses need for a fraction
of a fraction of a cost where you use
all of the features. There's no features
that you're paying for but not using.
It's exactly what you need for pennies,
&gt;&gt; right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh yeah, totally. Okay, quick
thing on my end. If you uh see my screen

[14:00]
thing on my end. If you uh see my screen
here, this is tkowners.com. This is a
community that Chris uh runs that I help
him run. It's amazing. If you want to do
anything in the world of
entrepreneurship and business, you got
to get in this community. We're doing
stuff like this every day. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, it just spit out it spit out my
pricing update, which was great. So, it
did it and it did all the ratios and all
that. And then it asked me if I wanted
to like build a robust back-end database
and stuff. And I just said, "No, just
email me the quotes, you know, once
someone fills it out. Just email me the
quotes to brandwaller media.com. And can
you also launch this on a live test
URL?"
&gt;&gt; So, let's see what happens.
&gt;&gt; It's funny because it's like in using
these tools, you kind of have to retrain
your brain, right? Like
&gt;&gt; let's say you get to this point and
you're like okay let's say we've never
used a vibe coding app before right we
get to this point where we have a
working prototype and we want it to be
on a website but we don't even know like

[15:01]
on a website but we don't even know like
how to ask it that right like all right
I've never used emergent before so like
the gut instinct is to Google like how
to deploy emergent app onto a website
but no like just use the chat interface
that you're currently using to build the
app to ask it questions about the app,
you know, okay, ready to deploy. What do
I click next? And then it will switch
from being like a coder to a customer
support agent all within the same chat
window. But yeah,
&gt;&gt; you just have to start thinking along
those lines.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, totally.
&gt;&gt; Look at my screen. Like it just asked me
a bunch of questions. Some were
technical, some not that technical. I
asked it. I said, "Email me the quotes."
And then it said, "Okay, what um API do
you want to integrate?" And then it gave
me some choices. And I'm like, "You know
what? Just put the lead forms on a
Google sheet to make it faster."
&gt;&gt; Mhm. [clears throat]
&gt;&gt; And then and it it had asked me like all
the info that I want, blah blah blah.

[16:00]
the info that I want, blah blah blah.
And I was like, just include whatever
the person enters in lead form and the
instant quote. Like I'm not doing me,
Brandon. I'm not doing anything fancy
here. To your point, I'm just chatting
with this thing and I'm like, "Yeah,
just do this." Like I'm like,
&gt;&gt; yeah,
&gt;&gt; just commanding it like a, you know,
entrylevel employee who happens to be
amazing in AI.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, I like how it gives you an
option to deploy it right within the
chat window with a big green button. You
can't miss it. You can preview it um by
clicking that. I don't want to talk you
through what I've done so far, but I
want to test it first. All right. Can I
walk you through what I've done?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; All right. All right. So, I'm not going
to tell you yet what my original prompt
was. But here's the logic of how I'm
looking at this. So, I wanted the name
and phone number because this is a lead
magnet, right? This is accomplishing two
goals at once. It's saving me time
because it's quoting a job for me
because the these guys probably spend a
lot of time on the phone. And if they're

[17:00]
lot of time on the phone. And if they're
mowing a lawn, like the average business
owner in this space at least is out
there mowing lawns all day. They're not
like they don't have a receptionist,
right? So, they're losing money ignoring
calls from people that want a price
because they're probably already very
targeted and like it's probably a very
hot lead that they're ignoring, right?
And so, if they could just have an
autoresponder say, "Oh, I'd love to
offer you a price. Just fill this out
real quick." Then, a they get the lead
and b they save time, right?
&gt;&gt; So, [clears throat] that's kind of how
I'm looking at this going into it. So, I
want the name. I want the phone number.
I don't care about email because this is
a very phone-based business. I need to
know the acreage and I told emergent or
I just reminded it like you know we're
using acreage as like 43,500
square feet per acre, right? So if they
put in 0.1 it's going to be 10% of that
and then we're using house square
footage because they're going to
subtract that from the acreage. And then
I also told it subtract 10% of the
acreage from the square footage as well.

[18:01]
acreage from the square footage as well.
So let's just say it's a 0.1 acre lot.
That's roughly 4,300 square f feet. And
let's say it's a,000 foot house.
Subtract that. We're at 3,300 square f
feet. But then we also need to subtract
10% of the lot size to account for the
driveway, which is going to be 430. So
that leaves us with uh what, like 2,600
square ft, right? And then I know based
on the last neighborhood I lived in that
like a a small house on a small lot like
that is going to be about 40 50 bucks.
So I just said multiply the the square
footage by 1.6 cents because that's
about how you get to about 40 50 bucks,
right?
&gt;&gt; So it spit that out for me and then it
worked and then I said, "Whoa, whoa,
whoa." I I tried like half an acre and
it gave me like $300. And I'm like, I
know that's way too much for half an
acre. So then I went back and I said,"I
need to scale the pricing for larger
lawns. A half acre lawn and 2,000 foot

[19:01]
lawns. A half acre lawn and 2,000 foot
house should not cost 281. Your math is
right, but that price is way too
expensive." Okay, so like do a discount
against the 1.6 cent rate of 20% for
every quarter acre.
&gt;&gt; So obviously I did a very poor job
explaining that, but don't get hung up
on doing a good job explaining it. It's
going to figure it out, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And then it spit out something
that worked and it said, "The tiered
pricing feature has been added to the
calculator incorporating volume
discounts for larger properties," yada
yada yada. It breaks it all down. Guys,
I have started dozens of businesses at
this point. And every once in a while,
I'll see some random fee in my bank
account that makes zero sense to me. And
when you're dealing with international
stuff, you see it all the time. It's not
uncommon for currency conversions to eat
3 to 5% of every transaction. It's
insane. But Airwalk fixes this with
things like multicurrency accounts
across 60 plus currencies. No double
foreign transaction conversions killing
your margin. You can collect payments in

[20:00]
your margin. You can collect payments in
euros, hold them in euros, pay suppliers
in euros. None of that converting back
and forth. Over 150,000 businesses use
them across 160 countries. They've got
corporate cards and expense management
built right in. So stop bleeding fees
and go check out airwalls.com.
your global business without borders.
And then I said add a field for asking
how many mos per month if once full
price twice equals 20% off the total per
mo three or more equals 40% off the
total per mo per mo. And then it did
that quite perfectly. And where I'm at
now is I said work in a minimum because
I I played around with it and one of the
quotes it gave me was $0. And the math
was right. Right. I did like a 5,000
foot lot and a 5,000 you know square
foot house $0. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So I said work in a minimum where it
will never quote any job less than $40
per mo. It will override all math and
then add in a check box that says add in

[21:01]
then add in a check box that says add in
weed eating for insert price more per mo
and then the price should be 20% of the
total mo amount.
&gt;&gt; Sweet.
&gt;&gt; So that's where I'm at right now. Where
are you at? Okay. So I asked it to just
house all the info on a Google sheet and
so it says that it just finished that.
So it's got all the quote generation
built. It says the backend has been
tested and all API endpoints are
responding correctly. It says it's all
ready to go. It says I need to follow
the Google Sheets setup.m MD little
thing that it gave me to create the
Google sheet basically that it will
connect with and it has that above. So
I'm going to do that really quick and
then launch it. I think one thing that's
worth noting is like depending on what
industry you're in when you're watching
this, we're building lawn care quote
generators. The same logic can be

[22:00]
generators. The same logic can be
applied to so many industries whether
you're a roofer or a painter or in
fencing or whatever like calculating fee
and you know logic and spitting out the
correct pricing y and then using this
for lead genen and spitting out a quote
right away which is not the norm these
days right the norm is me if I want a
new roof I have to call roofers and then
they say they're going to come out or
maybe they didn't even answer the phone.
So, like this is a good way to get
around that, get some instant feedback
and hopefully quick leads. And what I
would do if we had more time today or if
I really wanted to build this out once
the thing is live, I would probably also
structure it to where I get pinged or I
would for sure structure it to where
every time someone's fills out a form
and they submit their contact info that
I would get a text. I wouldn't just want
the email. I'd want to text with their
info and I would text and call them
right away saying, "Hey, I got your

[23:01]
right away saying, "Hey, I got your
thing. It's, you know, the quote says it
would be 80 bucks uh a week, but
actually if if we start this week, I'll
do it for 75." So, you're like double
overd delivering over any normal
competitor, which is transparency of
pricing upfront and speed to reply. In
the home services industry, those two
things are not that normal. So, this
strategy helps you stand out with both.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It helps you look like a
nationwide brand for next to nothing
software,
&gt;&gt; right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And one thought that I had is like, no
shade to Jobber, but if I want the
Jobber account that has that has like
the SMS functionality or a lot of these
things, it's like four or 500 bucks a
month. It's crazy.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Like the vast majority of
businesses cannot afford that and the
[clears throat] vast majority of
businesses might need like really need
three of Jobers 50 features 100 features

[24:00]
three of Jobers 50 features 100 features
right so once again I already said this
but they're paying for all this stuff
that they don't even use but with
something like this maybe like this one
little feature is a gamecher for them it
helps them close more deals it helps
them save time right not miss out on
stuff for a tiny price and then like
this could be free this could be your
lead magnet and this could be your foot
in the door to start charging them for
other stuff to start charging them for
their own version of Jobber, right?
Yeah. Or for a lead genen service or for
anything.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Totally.
&gt;&gt; Hey, quick note for some commenters out
there. You don't need to say the Malcolm
in the middle comparisons to me anymore.
Malcolm in the middle all grown up.
You've been you've been sharing that in
the comments.
&gt;&gt; I don't want to hear they're saying that
about you.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm just joking. But yeah, on
every YouTube video of yours that you
posted of me, people make Malcolm in the
Middle comparisons.
&gt;&gt; Oh my gosh.
&gt;&gt; I've never seen the show actually, but I
heard it was good.
&gt;&gt; Have you heard that before from others?
&gt;&gt; I never, but it's just in your YouTube

[25:00]
&gt;&gt; I never, but it's just in your YouTube
videos that I appear on.
&gt;&gt; That's amazing.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. Mine is live. I'll show the
URL.
MoMaster-6.emer.host.
Check it out. So, enter your lawn size.
So, I I did do it differently. So, I'm
counting currently on people knowing how
big their lawn size is, either in square
feet or acres. Lawn mowing, hedging,
bi-weekly, instant quote. Boom. 2,000
square feet, 112 bucks. Discount
applied. Awesome. What's included? Okay.
Okay. Okay, so I just entered my info to
receive the quote. Thank you. You know,
it gives me the thank you page and that
I'll be contacted shortly. Also,
business info here, which obviously I
could customize if this was real. Yeah,
it all looks pretty good, pretty quick.
Then I would just get the contact lead

[26:01]
Then I would just get the contact lead
and contact them. So, it spits out the
thank you confirmation and then that
information, the lead form just goes to
my Google sheet. And so, now, you know,
the $112.50
is there along with their contact info.
And if I was Greenscape Lawn Care, if I
was the owner of that company, I would
just, you know, call and text them right
away and I would probably offer them a
discount off this 112 to get started
this week and to close them and um good
to go.
Oh man, yours looks better than mine.
[laughter] Dang it. [gasps and snorts]
&gt;&gt; I I do like the little the blurb they
gave me and the little sub thing.
Professional lawn care instantly quoted.
Get your personalized lawnmowing and
hedging quote in seconds. Quality
service, transparent pricing. Beautiful.
&gt;&gt; Okay, so that's a little it's a little
different. It's almost like yours is
like its own standalone business, right?
Whereas mine is like a little widget

[27:00]
Whereas mine is like a little widget
that I'm sending customers that's not
meant to be like publicly facing. You
know what I'm saying?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I guess my thought
process is this. I would have like this
would be a landing page or a homepage of
a live website that I would try to drive
traffic to to get customers with.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; That was the approach I took. Whereas
the approach I'm taking is like kind of
like mis call text back right you're
mowing the lawn someone calls you or
someone texts you if and this would be
an additional automation we'd have to
build u probably outside of emergent but
if it's not answered let's say if the
phone isn't answered at all and if the
text isn't answered in 5 minutes then
auto text a link to this and say so
sorry I'm actually mowing a lawn right
now I assume you want a quote happy to
do that fill fill this out. It'll only
take 30 seconds and then I'll call you
back like in person. That was kind of my

[28:01]
back like in person. That was kind of my
intent for this.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, you could probably use Lindy
plus emergent to do that, right?
&gt;&gt; Yep. Or Zapier or go eye level or
whatever.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Maybe you could even use emergent to do
it, you know? I don't know. I don't know
it well enough.
&gt;&gt; Okay, mine is ready. So, there's mine.
There's yours. Yours is like kind of a
landing page. Looks super nice. You've
got these boxes right here are
responsive. You've got a shadow
gradient. It's nice and like it's green
but not too green. It's different
shades. It's not shouting at me. You
have two different check boxes here for
lawnmowing. Hedge trimming. Service
frequency. I like that. I like how you
have square feet in a separate box. Lawn
size, service frequency. I'm going to go
ahead and Okay, this is cool. I'm going
to do one acre. We're going to do
lawnmowing and trimming. We're going to
do bi-weekly. Get instant quote. Okay.
It was literally instant, which is
awesome. Your custom quote, $2450 per

[29:01]
awesome. Your custom quote, $2450 per
service. So, that's a lot.
&gt;&gt; That seems high.
&gt;&gt; Yours that seems high. $2,400 to mow an
acre. But on the like visual side of
things, I think yours is a no-brainer.
What's included? I like that. and then
they fill out the lead. I don't prefer
the fact that you don't get their
information until because if they if
they don't like the price, you're never
going to get their number, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true.
&gt;&gt; Contact information. That's nice. I
don't have that. So, I guess my favorite
things about yours, if I look at it
holistically, is it looks better. It's
better design. I like that you
incorporated Airbnb into the prompt,
which we'll get to in a minute. And I
like just the UI of like the check boxes
on the homepage and all that. What I
don't like is that you don't get their
information unless they like the price
and the fact that the pricing doesn't
seem quite dialed in. Whereas I spent
less time on the look of it and more
time on the math of it on the back end.

[30:01]
time on the math of it on the back end.
That's my gut take.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure. Yeah, I need to fix that
cuz I said I think I started at 50 bucks
for 1,000 square feet, but 1,000 square
feet is not that much for a lot. So
scaling that up to an acre adds up
pretty quick. So I didn't do any like
scale down pricing logic and all that
kind of stuff. I more just did ground
&gt;&gt; up and go from there. So I need to fix
that. And I think what you said on the
info on the lead information side is
everyone needs to decide like I'm
counting on the instant price in which
case I need a fix. But can I deliver an
instant price so good that they'll give
me their contact info? So, I'm I'm
willing to like lose some people that
won't give it to me regardless
&gt;&gt; because I know because the ease and
speed I'm hoping will make up for it.
&gt;&gt; Well, a thousand%. I mean, that's the
age-old
&gt;&gt; trade-off when it comes to lead
generation. The more friction you

[31:01]
generation. The more friction you
implement, the fewer leads you get, but
the higher quality those leads will be.
the less friction there is, you're going
to get a lot more leads, but your closer
rate will go way down. And there's no
right way. It depends on the industry,
you know.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, I just broke down yours. Why
don't you share your screen? Okay. Wait,
what's yours? Moid.
&gt;&gt; mobid.emer.host.
Quick question. What if there were a
private community out there of people
that were building businesses based on
this podcast? Well, I just made it and
it's only for business starters and
business builders. It's called TK owners
and it's basically like having me and a
hundred other business geniuses as your
business partner. Also, there's going to
be exclusive new trends, growth hacks,
business ideas, and a database of
everything I've ever talked about.
You'll find thousands of startup case
studies. You'll have weekly ask me
anythings with me while I'll answer your
questions directly. You can join now at
tkowners.com. Link in the show notes.
&gt;&gt; Well, I like it. It's very simple.
There's only literally one thing I can
do here. So, let's see here. acreage.

[32:01]
do here. So, let's see here. acreage.
I'm gonna do I'm gonna do 1.5.
Actually, I'm gonna do 2.2 house square
footage. I wonder how it calculates this
cuz it like is it like the footprint?
You know, what if it's two stories?
&gt;&gt; I thought about that and I did not
incorporate that into the math. So,
&gt;&gt; yeah, I don't even know. That's fair.
I'm just curious. Okay. Calculate.
&gt;&gt; That's another trade-off, right? Like I
could add that question in. I could add
that question in and I might get 5%
fewer responses because it's more
friction,
&gt;&gt; you know, right? But it could be a more
accurate quote,
&gt;&gt; you know.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, lot I did do 2.2 acres, so
it's obviously a big lot. Takes away the
house, takes away the driveway, mobile
area, 40% with 3x monthly service. I
like that cuz that's what I chose, but I
like the extra call out in a separate
color on the discount. I did want weed
eating, so it adds that 500 bucks per
cut. Yeah, that's pretty sweet. And, you
know, I didn't work in a pay now thing

[33:01]
know, I didn't work in a pay now thing
because, you know, we had different
thought process processes with what we
were trying to build here, but I like
that you already set that up because
yeah, that would if you were to, you
know, fully integrate that then that
would be uh that'd be awesome.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. One of the last prompts I gave it
was put in a blue pay now link that I
can add a Stripe payment link to.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, right now it leads to a dead
stripe link. But
&gt;&gt; yeah,
&gt;&gt; what I don't like about mine now that I
see it is it doesn't it doesn't scale
the discounts enough based on the
property acreage. 512 for 2.2 acres is
still too much. Like I know in Texas
&gt;&gt; there there have been a few times when
I've gotten two of my acres mowed and
weed eated and it was like 200 bucks.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, because I
&gt;&gt; maybe in some markets
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mow mine and I I I probably
actually have something like I have a
decently big back lawn. I I probably
have like an full acre plus of lawn that
I mow with a riding lawn mower and it

[34:01]
I mow with a riding lawn mower and it
only takes me like an hour and a half.
So like I wouldn't pay, you know, five
four 500 bucks
&gt;&gt; for an hour and a half. My time is still
worth more than that in my head. Also, I
enjoy mowing. So yeah, that's that's a
good call out. I think the only other
call out that I would say as far as how
to improve cuz I like everything else
would be include more like what are the
benefits? What are the things that are
included in the job? You know,
&gt;&gt; clean up.
&gt;&gt; Mhm. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; All that kind of stuff.
&gt;&gt; That's true. Because if I'm trying if my
goal is to save time here, then that
would help accomplish that goal,
&gt;&gt; right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; It's too simplistic.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And it would have just been an extra
sentence in one of my prompts to add
that. It wouldn't even have had to have
been its own prompt that takes time to
load and everything, you know.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, I want you to approve of this. I
don't want it to be a leading question.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; If you were a busy lawn care business
owner wanting a simple web app that
quoted jobs for you, which one would you
use? Is that pointing people towards

[35:01]
use? Is that pointing people towards
mine too much?
&gt;&gt; No. No, I don't think so.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Option A, option B, and then I
have a simple poll here.
&gt;&gt; Is that good?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; All right. I'm curious how much Twitter
suppresses it or not because it's too
late.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; But I'll just delete it once we get some
results here. All right, we got option B
right here. We got option A right here.
I mean, I'm kind of asking a lot of
people like click on two different
links, play around with them.
&gt;&gt; You're dominating me already.
&gt;&gt; I am.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Oh, interesting. Oh, you commented on
it. Did you vote on it? I voted on mine.
&gt;&gt; Look at that.
&gt;&gt; You're up. So that's your only vote
then.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. [laughter] Yeah.
&gt;&gt; What the heck?
&gt;&gt; All right. You got a couple votes.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Well, I'm going to hurry and make
a Twitter bot. Just kidding. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; When does it become statistically
significant?
That's what we need to decide on.

[36:01]
That's what we need to decide on.
&gt;&gt; It won't be until I'm ahead. So,
whatever that number is. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; Well, there's a good question. 50,000
votes.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. Well, it's not uh
statistically significant yet because
I'm not winning yet. So, keep keep it
going. It's moving in your direction. I
should end it right now. Oh, I won.
&gt;&gt; All right.
This is fun. This is good. Why don't we
take this time while we wait for votes
for you to read what your first original
prompt was and then I'll do the same.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah. So, my first prompt in an
effort to um show people that you don't
have to be a genius of any kind to to
get good vibe coding platforms going.
Mine was simple. I went off Chris's joke
about the Iranian prison. So, I typed
that in for fun. I said, "I'm in an
Iranian prison and need you to build me
an app perfectly so I can escape. I need
you to build me a web app for a lawn
care business. It will be a quote
generator." That's all I said. like
literally almost no I would say no

[37:01]
literally almost no I would say no
details of any kind and uh I worked
through it a little of course over time
but the first one was very simple and it
already you know got me going on the
journey pretty dang good so I was happy
with it I think that's great I'll read
my original prompt mine was longer I
want to build a web app for lawn care
business owners to use to enable
potential customers to quote a job it
should be a simple form with a
calculator on the back end the form
question should be one name two phone 3
acreage four square footage of the
house.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Then the calculator should subtract the
square footage of the house from the
acreage and then subtract another 10%
off the size of the lot to account for
the driveway. And I just totally made up
that 10% number. I have no idea how big
a driveway is in relation to the lot.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Then the quote it spits out should be
1.6 cents for every square foot of the
property. And once again, I got to 1.6
cents by just getting to $50 for a small
lot. For example, a 0.1 acre lot is
about 4,300 ft². Let's say the house is

[38:00]
about 4,300 ft². Let's say the house is
1,000 ft². The driveway is going to be
430 ft² or 10% of the lot size. So, the
quote should be 4592 per cut, which is
4,300 minus 1,000US 430 multiplied by
1.6 cents per net square feet of lot.
Make sense? So, I I wanted to like show
it my math just to hopefully save me
another prompt or two on correcting a
mistake. Yeah, if somebody were to judge
us based off of our prompts, your IQ
would be approximately four times higher
than mine off of our initial prompts.
&gt;&gt; Whatever. I looked quite
&gt;&gt; That's okay. I'm I'm okay though. But
yeah.
&gt;&gt; Okay. I calculated how many words I
typed in in total to emergent over the
course of my six prompts. So, six
prompts in total and 211 words is how
many words I typed in. That's very very
low.
&gt;&gt; Seems very efficient.
&gt;&gt; That's like incredibly low. I'm guessing

[39:01]
&gt;&gt; That's like incredibly low. I'm guessing
&gt;&gt; it seems efficient though.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz fewer words equals it it could
it could equal more time, right?
&gt;&gt; But it it could also equal fewer
credits, like less cost on building this
thing.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; All right. So, my count here's my final
count. I had one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine. All
right. I had nine prompts for 354 words.
What was yours again?
&gt;&gt; Six prompts for 211.
&gt;&gt; Very interesting. So, I had like
60 70% more words and 50% more prompts.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Than you. I mean, I would say both of us
with one more good prompt could make all
the changes needed that we would want to
make on ours before making it fully
live, right? Like some slight
adjustments to pricing logic on both of

[40:00]
adjustments to pricing logic on both of
ours and some other things. And
obviously we took different directions,
but in I don't know under 400 words for
you and 10 prompts and in under 250
words for me and seven prompts will have
something live
&gt;&gt; and working in the span of under an hour
as well.
&gt;&gt; So my prompts had 40 words per prompt
and yours had 35. So pretty close.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Interesting.
&gt;&gt; So it's it's almost like we net it out
the same. You know what I'm saying?
Yeah,
&gt;&gt; like same amount of time. What were your
credits?
&gt;&gt; I'm at currently I've got 51 left.
&gt;&gt; So I have 42 left. So which track? So
like I had a
&gt;&gt; few more prompts, few more characters,
few more credits, but we did them both
in about the same time.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So if we go to our poll,
&gt;&gt; Yeah. you are winning.
&gt;&gt; 64% to me,
&gt;&gt; 36% to you.
&gt;&gt; It's not statistically significant. And
I want everyone to be reminded of that
because you're [laughter]

[41:02]
&gt;&gt; I got to screenshot this for posterity
sake.
&gt;&gt; Well, should we call it?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. No, this is good. You could do let
us know in the comments which one you
think won if you want.
&gt;&gt; Yes, please.
&gt;&gt; The comments might disagree here, but
yeah, we we can put these URLs in the
the description of the video. You can
let us know which one you think won. I
won't be offended if it's not me. No
worries.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And if you're a landscaping
business owner, go to uh mob
bid.emer.host
or what was yours? Like momonster.
&gt;&gt; Mo-6.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Mo-6. Great domain names.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, great domain names.
&gt;&gt; Well, this was fun. Emergent seems like
an awesome tool. If we wanted to keep
this app on emergent, it would cost 20
bucks a month. Or we could export it and
take it somewhere else. But it cost us
about about 10 bucks to launch these
apps. Not bad. super fun, easy to use.
