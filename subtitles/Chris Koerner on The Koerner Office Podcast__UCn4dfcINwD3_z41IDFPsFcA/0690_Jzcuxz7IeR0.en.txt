everyone's hyped about Google's new V3 video
generation tool because it makes wild videos
from just one prompt but no one is telling you how
to actually make money with it So today I'm going
to show you exactly how people are using VO to
land $10,000 gigs pitch big video editing agencies
and skip hiring expensive editors altogether And
at the end I'm going to show you the same pitch
that people are using right now to get in with
video production companies who don't want to
keep paying 10 grand per shoot And as a bonus
I'm going to show you how to clone your voice
and license it out to others for passive [Music]
income But first what actually is V3 well it's
Google Gemini's new AI video generation model And
yes it is now public It's 250 bucks a month but
you can get half off for the first 3 months But
don't even worry about spending that right now
because that's why I spent it so I could show you
how to use it before you ever have to spend a dime
But I'm telling you right now this thing is
on a different level Nothing will ever be the

[01:00]
same when it comes to video generation video
production or video editing This isn't just
some midjourney clone This is Hollywood level
video fully AI generated from a single sentence
Here's a couple examples that people are making
with this Initial reports say we experienced
a magnitude 9.0 earthquake Yo I need you to
stay at the house I'm going to come get you
Where is the prompt writer to save you from
me where is he you still believe we're made
of prompts none of us is real We're here because
someone decided to write a prompt We all hate him
for it You could have written a prompt that would
make me happy Instead you wrote a prompt that made
me sick He always says my cooking is not good
but he finishes everything He knows I make the
most delicious food ever Now it's not fair to
compare this to Sora Cling Pika Runway This is
different It's in a category all of its own Cling
is good It's flashy but this stuff is mostly just

[02:02]
eye candy It's a gimmick There's no storytelling
There's no sound You get a visual but not like a
real video Sora is good It's really good but it
takes ages to stitch 8-second clips together and
it's harder to monetize than V3 A lot of these
video generation tools generate faces that glitch
movements that are choppy or robotic There's no
real cinematography but VO showed up and just
nuked the entire category You've got real camera
movement shallow depth of field sound design and
audio baked right in Voices sound effects ambient
noise straight from the prompt It's not just a
visual generator It's the first AI filmmaker And
there are so many ways we can monetize this stuff
The CEO of DeepMind said "Vo marks the end of the
silent era of AI video." Let that sink in We just
left black and white behind We've been living in
Charlie Chaplan's world and now Pixar just entered
the picture This is full-blown IMAX I mean look
at this video right here It was generated from

[03:00]
the prompt "A paper boat set sail in a rainfilled
gutter." And look at this cinematic close-up The
water's flowing the boat's tilting the reflections
are moving It looks like an A24 short film So
whether you're a creator a marketer or just
someone who doesn't want to shoot a hundred takes
on your phone every week this is your moment 250
bucks a month sounds expensive until you realize
you're getting an entire production team for the
price of a single stock clip But the question is
remember that's why you're here is how do you sell
this how do you monetize this so let's get into it
Let's talk about who's paying for this stuff or
who would pay for this stuff First of all it's
been 2 days and people are already making money
with this Look at this Reddit post right here
This guy makes $500,000 commercials for pharma
companies And he generated something just as
good for half a day's worth of work and $500
in credits He posted this It went viral Video
production agencies started reaching out to him
and he's quoting 10 to $15,000 to make commercials
just like this with VO Crazy You don't need a huge
following You don't need a big business or a lot

[04:04]
of money You just need to start tinkering You
need a laptop some strategy You need to watch
this video Let's talk about the type of people
and companies that would pay for services that
you can sell with VO Number one brands Especially
smaller brands that sell online Think ecom Shopify
stores fitness skincare supplements coaching They
all need a constant stream of video content for
their Facebook ads their Instagram reels their
Tik Toks their YouTube shorts their stories
and they're tired of filming it themselves It's
thousands of dollars a month So what do you do
you offer them AI made UGC user generated content
No paid actors no cameras no real people but it
looks exactly like real people with high-end
visuals that fit the brand You could charge1
to300 bucks a pop You could charge 500 to $1,000
a month for four to eight different videos Test
all of these pricing models until you find what
works The second is agencies This is kind of the

[05:00]
sneaky play There are video production companies
and marketing agencies out there paying real money
for reals ads b-roll product shots stock photos
So you could reach out to them and say "Hey I know
you've already got a full team but what if I could
generate assets for you without sending a crew?"
Suddenly you're saving them time cutting their
cost and making yourself more valuable Because
most of these agencies don't want to mess with
AI believe it or not They just want results They
want what AI produces You can be the AI whisperer
behind the curtain So here's how this works I make
you free videos I actually know what I'm talking
about I have no greasy sales pitch at the end And
if you implement what I talk about you'll make a
lot more money and have a better life And all I
ask for in return is that you hit the subscribe
button and maybe even the notification bell just
like that Thank you Third real estate Realtors
are paying hundreds of dollars for promo videos
or thousands of dollars You can use VO to generate
cinematic drone flyovers interior B-roll even like
neighborhood lifestyle shots They just want to
look like million-dollar agents You can help them

[06:03]
get that vibe for $200 instead of $2,000 Fourth
stock footage I like this one because it doesn't
require any cold outreach anything intimidating
If you're more the introvert type you can create
these 5 to 10 second stock videos with one
sentence prompts using VO or other AI video
generation tools like Clling and upload them to
sites like Pond 5 Adobe Stock or Art List You can
focus on hyper niche moments such as chef cutting
herbs in a rustic kitchen teen scrolling phone
under neon light elderly couple walking through
snow The more specific the better And if you don't
know how to specifically prompt out a good video
use chatbt to write the prompt for you And fifth
service businesses think roofers landscapers med
spas dog groomers tree trimming guys they never
have video content And if they do they're paying
too much for it As of two days ago they're paying
way too much for it You could make these cinematic
before and after reels with VO You could put their

[07:05]
logo on it and offer a monthly content package
You could do this in a permissionless way where
you make it and send it to them before they even
know who you are You will be the one standing out
because no one else is doing this yet The bottom
line is this tech is brand new Most people have
no idea that it exists And that's your edge The
second they catch up your edge is not as strong
So move now test fast Send a bunch of DMs Sell one
video Now you have a case study Then you can scale
it So here in a little bit I'm going to show you
exactly how to land your first client what to say
what to do how to find them even if no one's ever
heard of VO Okay Now let's talk about how to pitch
agencies and get paid behind the scenes So this is
the real unlock If you don't want to chase small
clients or post on social media every day pitch
to agencies because they're already doing all the
client work You're just piggybacking on their
book of business on their success You're just
offering them a way to do it cheaper faster and
easier So here's the play Find a high-end video

[08:04]
production agency Could be local could be national
Just start googling stuff like video agency plus
your city Or you could check sites like Clutch or
Upwork And you're going to look for agencies that
charge real money for creative work Then you
send them a message like this Hey not sure if
your team is experimenting with AI video tools
yet but I've been using Google's new VO model
and it's nuts You can generate cinematic content
from a text prompt and I'm using it to produce ads
B-roll and UGC style content for brands without
ever picking up a camera Happy to show a few
examples if you're interested This could save your
clients thousands on low-budget shoots without
sacrificing quality Better yet it could prevent
you from losing clients that are about to use
these tools themselves That's it simple not pitchy
You're just trying to start a conversation because
the goal here isn't to like replace their whole
team You're just offering to take the loweffort
low margin work off their plate so that they
can focus on the big high ticket stuff Believe

[09:01]
it or not if you're on Twitter a lot Twitter is a
bubble Most of these agencies are not deep into AI
yet They're curious but they're overwhelmed And
frankly they're a little freaked out So when you
show up with something that they don't have like
VO or have never heard of you instantly become a
valuable resource And the beautiful part is that
you can let them deal with all the clients You
just deliver the content and get paid You're the
ghost in the machine So go to their website find
their portfolio find a couple of their clients and
generate two to three VO videos promoting their
clients and send it to them just to get their
attention Make sure it looks like a commercial It
needs to be polished And don't try to overexlain
the tech because that just makes them feel dumb
and they won't want to respond because of their
ego Just show the results A lot of these agencies
have clients paying $5 to $10,000 per video And
if you help them deliver it for less you're now
saving them money and increasing their margin
Win-win One of these agency clients could turn
into $1 to $4,000 a month every month without
having to interact with their clients So take some

[10:01]
time to learn these skills Build a demo folder
Reach out Put it in a Google Drive Keep it casual
You're not pitching AI You're pitching leverage
You're trying to solve a problem All right Now I
want to talk about how you could build your VO
portfolio in just a weekend Now remember we're
talking about a very very visual product So a cold
email or text or whatever by itself is not going
to do You've got to show them something Show them
something that blows their mind And pretend like
they've never logged into Twitter Like they have
no idea what VO is because most likely they don't
You just want to generate three to five good demo
videos that prove you know what you're doing and
you can make all of them this weekend So let's
start with three niches Fitness food lifestyle
All right here's prompt number one Cinematic slow
motion of a man training alone in a dim warehouse
gym Light beams through the windows Sweat is
flying 8K moody music When it comes to prompting
with VO the more specific the better Now if I take
that prompt and put it into VO here's exactly what

[11:01]
the video looks like Pretty incredible right
here's another prompt for you Closeup of a
steaming bowl of ramen on a wood counter Cinematic
lighting Depth of field Chopsticks lift noodles
slowly Here's what that one looks like Okay here's
another prompt for you Stylized video of a woman
walking through Tokyo at night Neon lights shallow
focus The vibe is dreamlike and modern [Music]
Make each one of these in your portfolio about
5 to 10 seconds Use background music Polish it
up Upload it to Google Drive or Vimeo with no
branding Now you've got a mini portfolio Oh and
if you want more awesome prompts like these just
feed these to Chat GBT as a reference and ask
for 12 more And here's the cold DM that I would
use to land your first client or agency deal And
don't overlook DMing the owner of these agencies
on Instagram because they're getting cold emailed

[12:01]
all day long but people are not reaching out to
them through their personal Instagram account
Here's what I'd say to them if I were you Hey I
know you have insert brand name as a client I just
made a video for them Do you mind if I send it to
you to see what you think you want them to opt in
to getting pitched That is always more effective
than just pitching them Then they're going to
feel beholden to actually watching the video that
you sent them because they agreed to receive it
Keep the message short and casual Once they
respond send the link to your Google Drive
folder and then follow up like a maniac until they
tell you to go away I guarantee you if you send
this to 10 to 20 agency owners you're going to get
responses from 10 to 30% of them One's going to
ask for pricing One's going to ask how you did it
One's going to say "Wow awesome but no thank you."
In fact a lot of them will say "No thank you."
But it's just a numbers game It's okay You just
need one and you're in You're not trying to build
a brand yet You're just trying to get some revenue
What's the point of using these tools if we don't
know how to monetize them all right now let's talk
about turning VO into recurring income One-time
payments are awesome Recurring is obviously

[13:02]
better So here's the play Create a simple monthly
content offer Here's why I like simple flat fee
offers Because people want to know what their
bill is at the end of the month You could say
$50 a video and that is less enticing than $500
per month for 10 videos I promise you people just
want to know what the bill is They don't want to
have to guess or worry that they get this massive
bill unexpectedly So yeah you could AB test both
options but I guarantee you the latter is going
to win So say something like four custom videos
per month for 500 bucks No shoot days no gear
just cinematic content delivered straight to your
inbox That's it Who do you think's going to buy
this well influencers and creators They need
constant content but they don't want to film
every week You become their quiet video team
small businesses gyms med spas coffee shops
chiropractors they want to look high-end online
but they can't afford a full film crew So send
them branded reels every month for $300 to $800
And hey what if you only do VO video generation

[14:03]
for chiropractors or only for med spas then
you can recycle the same freaking content with
every customer Make a couple changes and your
work just got cut in half You can sell this to
agencies Offer them a white labeled VO content
plan and they can sell it to their clients for
double You stay behind the scenes and collect
recurring checks They interface with the annoying
customers And if you want to scale it fast you
productize it Make one offer one deliverable one
price For instance 750 bucks a month for four
generated reels delivered on the 1st and 15th
Build a landing page use Stripe and just start
sending that link to people who already pay for
content You don't need to upsell them Don't even
think about that yet You don't need to do strategy
calls You don't even need to talk much Let the
videos do the talking the selling You're just
selling the outcome which is a great video done
for them Sign five clients at 500 bucks a month
You've got 2500 bucks a month for a few days of
work All from a tool that costs 250 bucks a month

[15:03]
And the best part is that the deliverables don't
change Once you know what works you can reuse
prompt structures across industries So start
this business only for chiropractors then only
for coffee shops then only for influencers only
for roofing companies etc etc You can literally
copy and paste the landing page especially if
you use something like card or web flow We're
building leverage here So now let's talk about how
to bundle your prompts into products that you can
sell Here's how to monetize video without clients
So video is cool but you know what's better long
form audio via podcast and my newsletter
tkopod.com Go there to subscribe for free to
my newsletter It's one email a week Very tactical
And then go to my audio podcast Three episodes a
week Stuff like this You're going to love it All
free No sleazy sales [ __ ] tkopod.com Let's say
you hate working with clients The high ticket just
isn't worth it for you Even the recurring isn't
worth it for you You'd rather do low ticket and
interact with no one You don't want to deal with
revisions or send invoices or collect payments or
all that Here's how to do it with VO prompt packs

[16:04]
You already know that most people have no idea
how to write a good prompt So you sell them the
solution Pick a niche like weddings fitness travel
luxury products Create 10 readytouse prompts Show
an example video for each prompt Bundle it up and
sell it on Gumroad or Notion for 29 bucks Sell it
on Etsy You can niche down even more if you want
10 viral VO prompts for luxury realtors or eight
high converting video ad prompts for skincare
brands Now let's talk about stock footage This
one's a little slower but it compounds over time
You can use VO to generate clips that feel like
modern stock footage Upload them to Pawn Five Art
List or Adobe Stock The more specific the better
Think of something like cinematic drone shot over
wheat field at golden hour or barista pulling
espresso in moody cafe lighting or teen in hoodie
scrolling phone under neon street light That's the
kind of stuff people buy when they're making
ads or music videos Just because you're not a

[17:04]
customer doesn't mean that customers don't exist
And the third way to do this is through courses
and tutorials There's going to be a gold rush of
people trying to learn VO people like you So you
get ahead of them by teaching it Do you think
Google's going away do you think Google's going
to stop doing video AI generation anytime soon of
course not Google is out for OpenAI's throat So
do something like launching a micro course Call it
how to create ad ready videos using VO in under 10
minutes And the beautiful thing is you can create
multiple of these businesses You could start with
the agency business and make recurring revenue and
then take everything you learned and put it in a
course and start that business too We're not about
having one business at a time right i mean come on
Who are you talking to here while you're learning
these things record your screen Why would you
not document everything you're doing Even if
you never publish it at least then you have
it Show them your best prompts Break down what
works Charge 49 bucks Or even better bundle it

[18:00]
with your prompt pack together and offer both
for 79 bucks You don't need a big audience or
any audience You just need 50 people to trust you
The fourth way to do this paid newsletter This is
a long game A newsletter is a slow burn but they
are somewhat straightforward to grow with Facebook
and Instagram ads My newsletter grew to 154,000
subscribers over the last year and a half You
could build an audience by sharing one crazy VO
video or weekly prompt breakdowns or new use cases
or anything If one of those goes viral you're off
to the races If it doesn't go viral then you put
paid ad spend behind it and you put it in front of
your target audience You could call it something
like the AI video drop or VO Vault or Vio Vong
Keep it short visual and helpful And once you've
got a few hundred readers drop a paid tier get a
couple percent of them to opt in and then we can
talk about community Because if you really go deep
on this you could start a small private Discord
or Slack group Charge 10 to 20 bucks a month Give
people early access to prompts critiques feedback

[19:02]
tools and then you can upsell them on anything
you want hourly consulting advisory services You
can take equity stakes in their businesses to help
them grow The options are endless because you're
not really selling info you're selling access
No clients no scheduling just leverage That's
how you turn VO into an income stream without
having to talk to people So if I had to start
all over gun to my head and use VO to make money
and I only had 250 bucks no clients no audience
here's how I'd do it Step one I'd buy access to VO
That's really your only cost 250 bucks a month and
it's half that for the first 3 months So really
we're talking about starting a business with
$133 including tax That gets you in the game If
it feels like too much this probably isn't for
you But if you're serious about making this work
that's your seed money Step two I would generate
three killer demo videos Not random clips stuff
that looks like it could be a paid ad And here's a
secret for doing exactly that Go to sora.com Click
on the explore page filter it by top month and

[20:06]
then video only And look exactly what Sora shows
you Not only does it show you these incredible
videos but it shows you the exact dang prompt that
people use to generate that video You could copy
those prompts More importantly you could learn
from those prompts You could paste those prompts
into ChatGBT a dozen at a time and say "What
are the first principles that cause the video
output of these prompts to be freaking amazing?"
And then ChatGBT will teach you what it is about
those prompts that make them amazing and specific
because you're probably not going to be able to
discern that on your own Look at these incredible
videos on the Sora Explore page Don't look at
the videos look at the prompts that generated
them and there is so much you can learn there
So use this trick to generate a few videos It
could be a paid ad I'd start with three niches
that spend money on content already today Fitness
food fashion The three Fs Prompt number one slow

[21:02]
motion of a man training in a gritty warehouse
gym Sweat dust 8K moody lighting intense music
Prompt two cinematic close-up of a chef plating
upscale food warm lighting shallow depth of field
clean textures Prompt three stylized montage of
a woman walking through a luxury retail store
Gliding camera classy vibe I would render those
trim them to 5 to 10 seconds and upload to a
clean Google Drive folder That's my portfolio Step
three I would cold DM 30 people 15 agencies and 15
small brands My message would be simple Hey this
is going to blow your mind I made this with AI
It's a fraction of what you're already spending
to make stuff that doesn't even look as good
Do you mind if I send you a couple examples once
they respond attach your three demos Even if they
respond and say no attach your three demos No long
pitch Let the work speak for itself And then step
four follow up with anyone who replies and offer a
test video for 100 bucks No meetings no contracts

[22:04]
Just ask them something like "Tell me what vibe
you want I'll send it back in 48 hours Once I
land that first 100 bucks I'm going to reinvest it
straight back into the next 30 DMs This time I'm
going to target by niche coaches realtors local
businesses with ugly videos And step five when I
hit two to three paid videos I'm going to package
it all up Now it's a $500 a month offer Four
videos per month branded scheduled done for you
And if I keep this cycle going I've got recurring
income within 30 days And I've never posted once
No audience no cold calls no editing no camera
just ideas prompts and delivery You see VO is a
tool but your offer is the product But now let's
talk about using VO as a foot in the door to sell
way more than just video So here's how to upsell
your current VO clients into bigger retainers
Let's say you just landed a client You're
sending them VO videos 300 here 500 there Cool Now
let's stack that into a real business because VO

[23:02]
is your foot in the door But what you're really
doing you're positioning yourself as their go-to
creative Now you have to kind of make this mindset
shift Most business owners hate content It's a
distraction but they know it's important and then
they feel guilty for not doing it They don't want
to think about scripting branding captions
thumbnails repurposing none of it They just
want someone else to handle it but they don't want
to pay too much That's where you come in So the
moment someone actually pays you for a VO video
you ask them one simple question Hey you want me
to handle the rest of your content too that's it
Short direct no pitch deck no funnel You've earned
their trust So now you're going to take what
you're already doing and add a few things that
you know they already need Here's a sample offer
you could use Four VO videos per month repurposed
into Instagram reels Tik Toks YouTube shorts
Facebook reels branded thumbnails captions plus
optimized posting format And then optionally you
could add one landing page or email per month And

[24:00]
the price thousand bucks a month And your pitch
you're contrasting this against a social media
manager that might cost two to four times that
You've got to pitch your offer against something
that they might use that's way more expensive It
can't stand alone by itself And as you earn their
trust and show your value you can scale that
1,000 a month to $2,000 a month and beyond And
no you don't have to do all this work yourself
You could outsource the captions You could use
Canva templates Cap Cut virtual assistants You
could automate things with Chat GBT with Gum Loop
with Lindy You're trying to become the creative
director here not the virtual assistant because
you're trying to move from freelancer to partner
because at the end of the day most of your clients
don't just want videos they want results they
want attention they want more money they want
more sales they want someone who can think for
them So you're just using VO really to open the
door throw your foot in there and then sell the
full package All you need is one client and your
VO license is paid four times over Five clients
you're quitting your job 10 clients six figures a

[25:02]
year Now let's talk about how to get ahead of the
wave because once VO goes mainstream this is going
to get a lot more competitive Okay so now you know
how to take VO from just a fun tool into real cash
Whether it's one-off projects monthly retainers
prompt packs stock footage or agency work you've
got a plan But the longer you wait to execute
on this the less attractive the plan is going
to be because more competitors will rush in Every
tool that gives people leverage eventually becomes
saturated And VO is no different Content's
insane right now Everyone's freaking out and
the competition is basically zero There's never
been a better time to launch something like this
Will this still be around in 5 years yeah it'll
just be harder Right now you have the benefit of
no competition and everyone is shocked by this
Okay in six months to 12 months people won't be
shocked and you'll have more competition So if
you're going to make a move make it now Start
with one demo one DM land one paid video That's
it You're in Now you got a case study Now you got
a track record So let's pivot a little bit Almost
no one knows about this but if you go to 11labs.io

[26:05]
io and record your voice You can license out your
voice on their marketplace and make money A little
bit of work on the front end recording your voice
and then passive income It's not going to be a lot
You're not going to be making many thousands
per month but it's very common for people to
be making hundreds per month and some are making
over a thousand per month for an hour's worth of
work Well if you have a weird accent or kind of
a weird voice even better any language any accent
any tonality the weirder the better because
anything normal sounds AI generated ironically
enough So you're gonna record some clean samples
of yourself If you've already recorded yourself
talking or something you could use that You could
just upload an existing file The trick is to read
in different tones excited nervous agitated and
then upload all of those voices into 11 Labs and
train your voice profile Then you can list it
in their licensing marketplace People use this
for audio books YouTube support channels customer
support bots and more You can price it per second

[27:04]
or per project And if you really want to lean in
you can build niche versions of your voice like
a high energy Gen Z narrator or a calm Christian
meditation voice or a luxury brand explainer tone
Once it's live you do nothing They use your voice
you get paid And then you can even pair that with
VO and you have AI visuals and AI voice without
lifting a finger And it's this is just the first
time in history that creative people can scale
without hiring filming or editing So use it Please
