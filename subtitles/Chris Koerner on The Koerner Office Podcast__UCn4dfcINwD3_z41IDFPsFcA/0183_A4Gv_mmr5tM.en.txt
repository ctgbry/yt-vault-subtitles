my professional time is split between
two passions starting businesses and
investing in mobile home and RV parks I
have invested in 31 mobile home and RV
parks in the last six years alongside
investors and here are the 18 levers
that we pull to increase the value of a
Park post purchase number one signage
many parks have either no or small
signage we'll have a massive sign
prepped by closing on day one so we can
install it many of these parks are on
roads they get 10 to 30,000 cars per day
driving by and we don't want to waste
that traffic number two local paper yes
newspaper ads for vacancies work great
in rural towns number three Landscaping
we will spend 10 to $20,000 in
landscaping on day one so we can justify
a small rent increase a $50 rent
increase across 50 pads equals
$450,000 in added value at a 7.5% cap
rate I'd say that's a good use of 20
grand number four roads similar to the
last one we will go in and fix all the

[01:01]
last one we will go in and fix all the
roads there's almost always something to
fix potholes especially if it's gravel
roads and upgrading to concrete or
asphalt is never really penciled for us
number five adding portable Self Storage
I used to be against this but it's grown
on me almost every park has extra space
to put down 10 by 10 they're
self-sufficient and it really boosts the
value and makes tenant stickier and you
can even use a service like square foot
before you spend a dime to gauge if
there's extra demand for self storage in
your area because it might be
oversaturated number six backfilling
vacant pads we buy used RV and mobile
homes and seller finance them out to the
tenants to make movein more frictionless
while still not having to maintain them
because think about it if you're waiting
for someone to pull in with their single
or double wide mobile home to get a new
tenant you're going to be waiting a
really long time you need to remove the
friction for them and please note that
seller financing these units the
legalities of this very state by state

[02:01]
legalities of this very state by state
sometimes you have to be a mortgage
broker and that is not a fun thing to do
number seven we will convert Park owned
homes to tenant owned this also varies
state by state but is fairly
straightforward in Texas Oklahoma and
across the southeast you don't have to
maintain them that's the whole point of
this game is to not maintain the units
and just maintain the infrastructure
under the ground number eight we will
post these listings to Facebook
Marketplace and Craigslist we will often
do this before we even get the property
under contract not before we close but
before we even get under contract
because we want to gauge how much demand
there is for these vacancies in the
local area we don't want to guess and
almost no Parks do this believe it or
not go look on Facebook marketplace
right now and see how many mobile home
or RV pads are listed for rent almost
none you will have inquiries on day one
or day negative 60 if you do it before
you get under contract and it takes 30
minutes to do number nine we will add a
billboard sometimes we once bought a
park in East Texas that already had a
billboard we parceled them off and sold

[03:00]
billboard we parceled them off and sold
them to someone else but often times
these Billboards will rent $400 to
$33,000 per month without any
maintenance whatsoever raising rents
number 10 yes we will often raise rents
in year one and then a few years later
um but we only do this after adding
value to the park and giving people
plenty of time to move out usually 90
days we don't do it yearly like many of
the big players uh you can do it
respectfully um or like we can do it
respectfully or a big real estate
investment TR TR a Reit can move in buy
a park and be jerks about it number 11
website Wix is our favorite Squarespace
also works well what's nice about
websites is that you can get all the
widgets on there and then every time you
buy another Park you can literally copy
and paste the website and just swap out
the pictures the sitap the name the
address Etc um number 12 We'll add
online pay we use AppFolio uh rent
manager was too clunky for us we don't
have any affiliation with either of them
that's on the mobile home park side on
the RV park side we will use campspot

[04:01]
the RV park side we will use campspot
which wasn't even around five or 10
years ago but it is taking the World by
storm today uh we also show tenants how
to submit complaints and applications
online as well and we convert them to
online pay it's tough depends on the
park it can take several months many of
these tenants do not have a bank account
um so we'll provide them with reloadable
debit cards number 13 we will not have
an on-site manager believe it or not
this doesn't work for parks that are too
big or that have a lot of amenities but
for smaller Parks sometimes we'll buy a
park that has an on-site manager that
doesn't need one um and so we will
replace them with handyman from
Thumbtack and with checking in every
month or every quarter depending on the
size of the park number 14 be available
answer your dang phone it sounds simple
but tenants need to have several ways to
get in touch with you at any given time
phone text and email especially if
you're going to be replacing an onsite
owner or manager like I just talked
about number 15 we like to send small
gifts on the tenants one year 2 year

[05:00]
gifts on the tenants one year 2 year
three year anniversaries no tenant has
ever experienced this this seems like a
luxury but it doesn't cost much and so
it really helps retain not just tenants
but good tenants and it helps attract
good tenants as well because good people
are attracted to good kind gestures uh
we'll often do an Amazon gift card or a
fruit basket or something like that
number 16 we will trim the trees on
month one I don't know what it is about
these Parks but they always need their
trees to be trimmed um they're rarely
trimmed by the the previous owner it's
something that's easy to overlook but
after you trim the trees in a park it's
shockingly noticeable how much nicer it
is when you raise the canopy and you
make them all look like a lollipop
instead of just a sagging tree that's
almost touching the ground and certainly
touching the tops of these units number
17 we like to find that one tenant
there's always one I call him my Bridget
because the first tenant I found like
this her name was Bridget bless her
heart find the tenant that spills all
the secrets there's always one you just
save three grand a month on a proper
property manager um number 18 give every

[06:03]
property manager um number 18 give every
single tenant an opportunity to get on
the phone with you in week one
preferably you meet them in person on
day one and you shake their hands and
they see that you're a real person but
get them on the phone as well uh just as
an added uh point of contact learn all
of their gripes uh and what they love
about the park and fix as many of the
most common occurring problems as you
can on day one and you'll learn that a
lot of these are not even that expensive
and believe it or not back to raising
rents a lot of tenants are not even
angry when you raise rents because they
know that their rent is below market
price and they're seeing it coming and
as long as you take care of them and
actually add value to the park and not
just suck the value out of the park they
will not resent you for it in fact they
will respect you for it thank you for
watching follow me if you like stuff
like this we'll see you next time
