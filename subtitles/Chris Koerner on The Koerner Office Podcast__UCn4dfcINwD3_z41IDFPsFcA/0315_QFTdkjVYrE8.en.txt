these five iPhones are worth about $110
each but I got them for free here's the
best business idea you've never heard of
so a few years ago I was a volunteer
wrestling coach we owned a chain of
iPhone repair stores and our biggest
business was buying back used iPhones
and selling them on eBay so I came up
with an idea I took a cardboard box
about like this one I printed a nice
flyer and put it on the side of it and
brought it into the wrestling room and
then I asked permission to email all the
parents of the wrestlers and it said hey
we're doing an electronics recycling
Drive bring in all your old devices that
you don't have time to sell or throw
away and our coach Chris Kerner will
sell them on eBay and give us a large
portion of the profits within 2 weeks I
had all kinds of devices in there some
iPhones and fortunately a couple
Androids as well I sold them on eBay for
thousands of dollars gave the vast
majority of the money back to the school
and kept the rest as profit I've already
done it it works you go do it much more
