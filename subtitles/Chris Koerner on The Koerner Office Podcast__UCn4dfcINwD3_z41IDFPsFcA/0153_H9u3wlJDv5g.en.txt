okay this is genius and behind every
genius product idea is a genius business
idea here's how I would use this above
ground pool to make a million dooll
business and how you can do it too I
would go to Tractor Supply and buy a
$400 stock tank like this one then I
would go to Amazon and buy a $200 above
ground poool Jet and nozzle kit I would
get them to my house I would build this
using YouTube and chat gbt I would take
professional pictures of it and post
pictures and videos of it in all of the
mom Facebook groups and on Facebook
Marketplace I guarantee you you can
build these for under 4 hours and
$11,000 of materials and sell them for
$5,000 it's not as white trash as an
above ground pool but it's 99% cheaper
than a real pool those are 120 Grand
nowadays you got a business on your
hands
