why isn't anyone out there copying
Yeti's Playbook it's clearly proven you
just find a boring ignored product offer
something three times higher quality for
10 times the price $20 tumblers nah $200
tumblers we use them every day you can
do this with Grill tools umbrellas
multi-tools flashlights camp chairs
insulated dog bowls 10x10 pop-up
canopies $500 fishing poles instead of
$20 disposable poles from Walmart I mean
Yeti's already doing this that's kind of
a problem they're doing it with other
products but they're not known for it
they've sold out they're private Equity
now their private Equity is your
opportunity a lot of direct consumer
brands are just slapping a fancy label
on something raising the price and
calling it nice but it's not good
quality who's going to be known for a
$300 camp chair that lasts forever if I
were doing this I would listen to every
podcast and interview from the yeti
Founders from their early days I mean
look at their old website I would
reverse engineer exactly what they did
and take do it with a boring product
