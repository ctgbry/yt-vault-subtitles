look at this freaking thing right here
what this guy built is a genius idea but
it's not a product he built it in his
backyard this needs to be a product look
how many views this thing has I dare you
to Jerry rig one of these together go to
thomasnet find people that are
manufacturing stuff like this get a
prototype get a patent pending and start
collecting pre-orders for this bad boy I
promise you someone will do this and it
will work look at this freaking thing
right here this guy in Thailand invented
a bike that enables him to be taken on a
walk by his dog while his dog gets
exercise this is not sold in Europe or
the states yet and in Thailand they
actually race on these things do I
condone this no but do I think there's
something you can take inspiration from
here yes now what plays to human nature
better that enables dogs to exercise and
their owners to be lazy look at this
freaking thing right here what a
beautiful life lesson these two girls
are teaching us so the girl on the left
is doing the hard part first she's
moving the cups that are furthest away
and the girl on the right is doing the
more logical thing first the easier
thing first the cups that are closest
she moves first but who ends up winning
I don't want to spoil it is this a
tortoise in the hair situation no is
this a work hardest when you're young
situation no I got married at 2 and had

[01:00]
situation no I got married at 2 and had
four kids between the ages of 23 and 29
and built businesses all along the way
and I would recommend it because of
Parkinson's law you're able to work hard
no matter what here's what this lesson
teaches us do the hardest tasks first
when you wake up and you turn on your
computer every day you've got two to
three things that are just going to suck
do those first and then everything else
will fall into place look at this
freaking thing right here they're making
and selling these things in Asia not in
Europe not in the US calculate how much
time it would take to make or to import
throw up some pictures or videos of this
on Facebook Marketplace before you even
own or build one just to gauge the
demand take note in a Google sheet how
many inquiries clicks views you get
based on what you see start selling
these things or not you either win or
you learn I freaking love this thing so
much here's what I love about this it's
a framework what did Casper mattresses
do they said why aren't people selling
mattresses on the internet because
they're so big and bulky and inefficient
to so they thought huh what if we
rolled it up wrapped it in plastic
vacuumed all the air out of that sucker
put it in a reasonably sized box and
shipped it anywhere we want and it
worked and now there's multiple billion
dollar companies doing the same thing
because they just said what if the most
incredible things in life are found at

[02:00]
incredible things in life are found at
the end of the sentence what if I tried
this guy just said what if we did this
with couches can we roll up a couch wrap
it in plastic vacuum out all the air and
ship it around the world yeah apparently
you can look at this freaking thing
right here this is the exact reason my
partners and I own $150 Million worth of
RV parks because the world is changing
people want to get outside Co broke us
we want to travel more so we're writing
that title way get more info right here
would you look at this freaking thing
right here new trend alert new trend
alert look at the price of eggs we all
know that's crazy expensive this
business business is making $17 million
a year doing what anyone with a backyard
could do and it's actually quite genius
see many Americans want to own chickens
but then they get sick of them or they
can't protect them and so this company
will lease you a chicken coup food and
chickens so you can raise your own farm
fresh eggs in your backyard without a
long-term commitment of owning chickens
and look how much they're charging $700
for a few chickens these eggs are even
more expensive than eggs at the grocery
store right now but it doesn't matter
because we want control of our own food
it's called rent a chicken this is not
an ad but anyone could cop copy this

[03:00]
an ad but anyone could cop copy this
business would you look at this freaking
thing right here everywhere you look
business ideas I cannot wait to see the
but what about insurance comments on
this video get yourself a tractor get
yourself some inner tubes and start
charging 10 bucks a ride for this thing
cuz this looks freaking fun would you
look at this freaking thing right here
so I've got a friend in Alabama that
sells underground storm shelters and his
business makes about 4 and a half
million bucks a year but I think this
business idea is even better but you
don't have to pick one or the other you
can still find a storm shelter
manufacturer and resell their stuff and
have a business on your hand you can
also sell these things and these can be
storm Sellers as well it all comes down
to packaging and framing are there more
potential customers out there that want
a tornado shelter or that want an
underground fridge underground fridges
are stupid why would you need one
because people want to be unique they
want something to show off some people
want to save the environment some people
want to double up they want a fridge and
a tornado shelter you don't have to
manufacture look how many views this
video has look at this freaking thing
right here what a brilliant business
idea and I'll take it a step further get
a piece of glass slap it over that thing
and it can be an awesome engine block
coffee table or glass often it's a fire
table this guy made this for himself but
I found a few people online selling
these things for thousands of dollars

[04:01]
these things for thousands of dollars
look right here for yourself now you can
do one of two things you can come up
with dozens of excuses about harded is
to find engine blocks cost stupid too
heavy or you can go freaking try the
thing you either win or you learn grab
