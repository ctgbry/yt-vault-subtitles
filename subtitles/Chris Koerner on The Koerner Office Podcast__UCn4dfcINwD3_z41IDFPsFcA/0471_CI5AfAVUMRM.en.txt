look at this freaking thing right here
I'm on Alcatraz the most iconic prison
in the world and here's my message to
you going into 2025 we overestimate what
we can accomplish in a year and we
underestimate what we can accomplish in
a decade just a little over a decade ago
I was in a prison like this in
Tuscaloosa Alabama as an inmate no as a
security officer working the midnight
Shi while being a full-time student at
the University of Alabama that was just
over 10 years ago and today life's
awesome so if you're in a rough spot
today just know that it won't last
forever you'll be out of it soon just
keep grinding follow me for more
