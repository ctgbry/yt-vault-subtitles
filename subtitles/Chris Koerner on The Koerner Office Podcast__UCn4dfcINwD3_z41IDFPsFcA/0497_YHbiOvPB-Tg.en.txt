you got to look at this freaking thing
right here because this hops on two
major trends that I love and this is a
business that you need to start day 18
of showing you 2012's best business
ideas follow for more number one it is a
proven fact that homes are safer and
more energy efficient when the interior
doors are kept closed norise reduction
fire safety HVAC efficiency improved Air
Quality Security on and on and on so
that's true number two cat people are
kind of maniac and I say that as a dog
person but both cat and dog people will
spend a lot of money on their pets look
at all of these Niche businesses that
you probably didn't exists that are
multi-million dollar Industries so with
this new product that I just now
discovered honestly you can charge
interior door cat door installation as a
service because how many homeowners want
to take a chopsaw to the corner of their
door none but how many cat owners want
their cats to be able to navigate their
house while keeping their door closed
probably a lot of them you can charge
for this this needs to be a thing I
wrote up a full business plan for it
