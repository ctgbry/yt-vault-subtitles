[00:00]
welcome to the ker office I am excited
about today because a couple weeks ago I
was on Instagram and I saw a video of a
guy building shelves and it had millions
of views and he calls himself the Shelf
dude and I thought this is interesting
this could be a cool side hustle for
literally anyone that can spend $100 on
a chopsaw so I posted about it on
Twitter it went viral got 1.5 million
views I drove over 3,000 clicks to the
Shelf dude's website this guy has no
idea who I am I never communicated with
him before and then so I reached out and
I was like dude come on my podcast I
want to hear about your business I think
people have a lot to learn about
starting a business through Facebook
Marketplace just on the weekends that's
approachable to anyone that they could
scale into a six or seven figure
business because that's what he did he
sells locally and he's selling six
figures uh worth of shelving per year
and it's a great business and anyone
could start any number of thousands of
businesses on Facebook Marketplace so we
talk a lot of tactics about how to
approach that specifically how to start
a shelf business because you can't
really ship these things Nationwide so
he doesn't really care about competitors
all over the country so anyway en I hope

[01:00]
all over the country so anyway en I hope
you like And subscribe and share with
your friends we'll see you next time so
how did you get going in the Shelf
business how I got into this was well
prior to all the little side projects
and things my wife and I have done over
the last few years this one started
about when I decided to go back to
school to get the MBA from here the
local University Utah Valley University
I've always been a woodworker I I have
had my tools I've done some projects put
some shelves up that type of thing house
project
but I was really struggling with keeping
the garage organized and so she came
across a similar type post on Facebook I
hate make a shelf like this okay okay
let's do that it saved a whole bunch of
back problems having to get into the
attic it was really see a need feel a
need type thing kind of forgot about it
decided to go back to school as I
mentioned but then oh how are we going
to pay for that well maybe a sale of
those shelves my wife said okay so I

[02:01]
those shelves my wife said okay so I
started posting those on Facebook shared
that around and that filled up my agenda
rather quickly and so just on your
personal Facebook account just on the
personal Facebook is a listing nothing
paid Facebook Marketplace Facebook
Marketplace and whether it was a a
really trending type Shelf at that
moment it's it's still kind of there
it's really popular it just blew up and
so I had a full-time job at the time um
9 to5 and I would just do this on the
weekends as installs borrowing my
buddy's truck didn't have one uh just to
be able to take the shelves to and
from pick up wood and such but then
after a little while you know probably
May 10th I finally quit the day job and
dedicated to the Shelf dude yeah you
gotta buy a truck then I had to buy a
truck on the Shelf dude was able to

[03:01]
truck on the Shelf dude was able to
afford that monthly cost and yeah just
going full steam ahead trying to now
dedicating those eight hours that I was
at work not doing this trying to
dedicate those eight hours to Growing it
in every other which way yeah cre
content or talking to more people making
more shelves so what happened or what
was it what metric or conversation or
sales number that gave you the
confidence to quit your job you would be
okay doing this great question yeah it's
it was many conversations with my wife
here at 11: 1200 a.m. writing on our
little whiteboard here in our room of
okay what's our numbers okay if I sell
this many shelves that's this much okay
now minus taxes let's we're going to
save this much from it this cost
obviously materials what's left over now
is that more or less than what we're
making now then we played with that
number oh I need to sell this many
shelves to get this number right just

[04:00]
shelves to get this number right just
that little Excel problem playing with
those numbers it was a conversation just
like that where we decided okay I we can
continue on like we are making a little
bit extra money but you're getting super
tired you're going to get burnt out
trying to you're you're burning the
candle at both ends working and working
till 12 and doing it it's not
sustainable healthwise at least or even
just it was getting super hectic with
life and the kids I'd come home and be
in the garage and
it just wasn't very conducive to good
relationships and things and so that was
a huge Factor but going from there to
pull this trigger it felt good let's the
numbers were there let's just risk it
and so we decided to to pull the trigger
now was there a marketing channel that
you weren't fully exhausting that you
knew all right like I'm gonna have to
pull this lever once I quit or did you
already have enough demand at that point
there was enough demand just through
Marketplace start prior to quitting the

[05:02]
Marketplace start prior to quitting the
day job we did start that Instagram so
if I was doing if I started this or I
did start this november-ish of
23 work through getting 20 plus shelves
a month okay and then in I think it was
January or February 2nd is when I
started the Instagram account that grew
to what is it now 56,000 followers
pretty quick that that was a huge Factor
as well but those were really the only
two channels we had that time when when
we decided to pull the trigger and then
a lot yeah yeah so that to answer your
question it was just those two but yeah
what was left over is we really hadn't
explored any of the ads Facebook ads the
Instagram ads I we created a Tik Tok
account but we just really haven't given
it our full attention which I'm sure we
could more even do what you're doing of
just talking about business and such via

[06:00]
just talking about business and such via
Twitter Youtube haven't even
touched I've had a lot of people request
that of hey do you have a a video to
show me how to do this there's videos
out there but I I you know it's just a
matter of time I guess now are you only
making that one model or different
variations of the model with
configurations or are you doing all
kinds of shelves at this point no it's
really just that shelf just for the 27
gallon totes sorry there is some 17g the
12 gallon
variations but it's just a smaller
version or just a shrunk down version
for those smaller totes same concept
though so sometimes you do them wider
sometimes
taller correct yeah as as on my website
and as in my videos like four High by
five
across 11 by whatever number 6 by 15 and
and what's what size tote you want yeah
so okay so can you break down the unit
economics of an a average shelf are you

[07:00]
economics of an a average shelf are you
buying it in bulk or just from Home
Depot what's your profit and all that
once again for all those listening and
wanting to do something similar
obviously you have some tips and tricks
that you learn along the way places that
you can find different prices obviously
if you buy in bulk it's going to be
cheaper for you but it's just a matter
of getting to that point right if you're
just doing one or two it doesn't make
sense to buy a whole bunch that being
said I get all the wood from Home Depot
I you you know buy a bundle of that it's
about 300 2x4s at a time we've made a
contact over in China for the
wheels Amazon get a whole bunch of stuff
just bulk for like screws and things
like that four High by five across on
wheels cost about $200 in material and
that's obviously with those bulk
discounts and then I charge
770 for the sh it's a good profit margin

[08:01]
770 for the sh it's a good profit margin
there yeah obviously not including any
time sure right how much time are we
talking time to make that shelf
obviously for a new newcomer that's just
buying a DIY DIY plan it's going to take
you three to four hours right if you
have everything laid out no
distractions and just following the
instructions probably go a little faster
but that's a conservative number right
now because I'm doing multiples at a
time probably takes me about
two hours to to out a couple shelves
making multiple and are you batching
like your Cuts you have like an assembly
line you know what I'm saying yeah yeah
yeah so I have my order of what I cut
first cut the verticals then cut the
rungs cut the bases after that I have a
little in my garage this all out of my
garage right now we actually getting a
warehouse here at the end of the month
so nice so we won't have to move around

[09:00]
so nice so we won't have to move around
yeah I try to have stations just kind of
move it down the line got an employee
that helps me just go faster cut and I
tend to do more installs he tends to to
be the Shelf Builder I'll do the install
with with the
clients do you offer any customization
for an upcharge or you try to keep it
you like the the Model T you any color
as long as it's black we can paint it
any color most recently been you know
we've obviously done the black and white
white comes out super slick especially
in a nice white storage room just go
mixes right with the wall any yeah any
color whether you want plywood on top
plywood on the sides I got a couple
other little hooks and things on that
are in the in creation so you can put
your chairs like your folding chairs
lawn chairs on the sides just mm even
doors on the front so it looks like more
of a cabinet Stu mhm just to hide the

[10:01]
of a cabinet Stu mhm just to hide the
bins I personally like the look of the
the bins visible but you also can't deny
the the cleanliness of everything just
covered up you can't see it yeah like in
your kitchen right so everything's
tucked away what is your volume looking
like nowadays and how has that grown
over time it definitely felt busier when
I had the day job right it's like oh man
super busy but now that's spread out
over just more time and I can deliver
throughout the week
I'd say it's roughly the same volume but
I mean it's less stress there's a couple
things that we could be doing that
whether do based on time we don't do or
just other priorities hey you got more
time now let's spend a little more time
together right there's been that kind of
tradeoff it hasn't
necessarily not equivalent but that's
not a word but it hasn't necessarily
translated into a 8 hours exactly shelf
dude it's it's just it's kind of
transformed a little bit but it back to

[11:00]
transformed a little bit but it back to
your question it's volume straight about
the same but that's also giving us some
time to work on some other projects too
that we've wanted to do yeah all right
if you are watching this clip right now
you are watching this on YouTube and if
you are a fan of podcast please check
out my podcast while you're at it
because sometimes I have podcasts that
aren't on YouTube and sometimes I have
YouTubes that aren't on podcast so check
out the ker office on any podcast
platform or you can go to TKO pod.com
also my newsletter will throw that in
there there are no ads It's weekly it's
different content than my podcast and
YouTube newsletter. chrisj cerner.com
You'll see the link and we'll see you
there are you doing much business
through your website selling the plans
or delivering stuff or like on a
percentage basis how much of it is just
you selling shelves there locally versus
stuff that comes through the website
percentage wise I'd say it's still
Facebook all all plans go through the
website which are still you get those
dings every few minutes which is cool
those notifications I'd say it's about
50 50 maybe you know 6040 through

[12:02]
50 50 maybe you know 6040 through
Marketplace it's more heavily and then
the website's 40% we're currently
working on a new website make a little
easier for you to make your shelf a
little clunky right now so that's one of
those projects I mentioned but yeah
Facebook market place and just chatting
with people that's the the bulk of the
business there it's just spending time
once you get that contact hey I'm
interested just spending the time with
them to to convince them on a shelf yeah
I guess like as far as the percentage
between selling physical versus digital
products plans gotcha no i' I'd say it's
still physical physical products are
still just because the vast majority
yeah yeah it's the vast majority the
plans are are just a minimal they don't
cost as much right so sell a couple
shelves and I'm beating what the plants
are so it's yeah back to your yeah
probably still that
6040 with just more physical products
okay what do you say to people that are
like why don't you just go buy these at
Costco that's what a lot of the comments

[13:01]
Costco that's what a lot of the comments
said right like this is 150 bucks at
Costco oh yeah and so my qu my answer to
all of you if you choose to watch this
is mine's going to hold a lot more
weight than the Costco one now Costco
recently came out with or at leas
displayed next to those 27 gallon totes
the metal one I don't even know the
brand there's a little it's silver round
tubes that you can adjust the height
like all the shelves yep yep have one of
those in my garage on Wheels as well
that I'm those are terrible they're kind
of flimsy if you get a lot of weight on
them they going to tip over so they came
out with one for those bins so one
across by four
high and yeah it's not going to hold
nearly as much weight they're selling it
for
$70 but yeah if you only put you know 10
lounds in each bin you should be fine
but mine's going to hold up a whole
bunch more probably last forever as in
the comments how much weight can this

[14:00]
the comments how much weight can this
hold I'd worry about the bin breaking
before the the Shelf m 50 lbs in a bin
well that's probably too heavy for you
to lift yeah so you wouldn't want to put
that in there anyway because you can't
lift it yeah so that's the biggest Point
aside from Aesthetics what people are
looking for you can paint mine any color
the metal you really can't even even not
that metal one but the plastic shelves
for the 27 gallon tote sure they're
cheaper but as most people where I'm
installing shelves and the reason why
they're switching over is because yeah I
have this 5 in gap above the tote that
is wasted space and I can only fit three
because the other like three and a half
but it just doesn't fit well because
it's not made for a tote taking a step
back and looking
at this whole Niche which is just
specifically for this shelf right it's
very specific everyone has storage
everyone has stuff empty space gets

[15:01]
everyone has stuff empty space gets
filled it's another book idea I have
hopefully nobody takes
that but yeah it's just stronger right
and with the wheels you can wheel it
around Costco doesn't have that or any
other one doesn't really have that if
it's wood you can screw other stuff into
it right yeah fight any which way are
you doing Facebook Marketplace boosted
posts at all or just like organic free
ones but prior to getting in contact
with this marketing agenc
that I mentioned we I did do a couple
boosted Marketplace listings not the ads
but just the listing boost I saw some
activity from that really not
noticeable and whether that was I didn't
pay enough or I didn't really give it
enough time to really the the ROI on
that well it seems like the boosted
listings are are specific to certain
things whereas you're selling is so
specific that they can't give it any

[16:02]
specific that they can't give it any
more visibility than it already gets
from an organic search right right
currently not paying for any of those
but with this marketing agency kind of
changing topics there with an actual ad
put them on Google and Facebook it'll be
more like what you see other places so
yeah what about competitors are you
seeing guys start to creep in on
Facebook Marketplace and undercut you
what are you doing about that yeah there
has been some undercutting that's been
the the challenge as of late is just
more people due to my popularity and
everyone seeing this oh I can do that
too well when you're in Utah where like
the land of
copycats I mean it is yeah yeah and so
we've had a couple of those instances
where people are using my photos on
their listings hey that's my photo take
it down or do your own whatever even
some that have bought my plans I see
them say hey what's going on this is my

[17:00]
them say hey what's going on this is my
photo oh hey the Shelf dude I bought
your plans I thought I'd give it a try
too right on man right on use you know
use your own
photo yeah do you worry about that just
inviting more competitors or is it such
a global business I don't know if that
was on our minds at the very beginning
of this that yeah people are going to
copy us not to say that we necessarily
copied anyone at the beginning because
you had plans out there you have DIY
plans out there for every
might as well might as well sell some
yeah there was really wasn't anyone
turning around and providing this
service I'll make it for you right so
that's where I feel we jumped in and
grew because there was no
competition yeah now yeah people have
caught on want to do the same thing make
a little extra
money good for them you know there's a
million fish in the sea right there's
plenty to go around I'm not by you doing
the same thing it's not to
say I can't find something of my own

[18:01]
say I can't find something of my own
right yeah have you thought about like
in in an effort to scale this having
because of the fact that you have a
pretty good Instagram following doing
like a paid community of people doing
the same thing around the world maybe 50
bucks a month put them all in the same
Facebook group or something where you
can trade secrets or here's a good
Lumber supplier or even being like a
like arranging a bunch of bulk Lumber
orders and then marking it up a little
bit and you being like the funnel to
that and then having other shelf dudes
out there buying it I haven't come at it
from that angle we have on the plans and
what's happened we're just flushing out
some wrinkles is not necessarily to do a
franchise model because that's legally
expensive to for that whole whole deal
to go down but more so an installer kind
of model where like I went out to
Florida and trained a guy to make
shelves out there currently with this
marketing agency were putting ads out

[19:01]
marketing agency were putting ads out
there m to create business they're
talking to me hey I'm in Miami I want a
shelf great this is how much it
is do the purchase through me and then I
just send the Shelf order to him he'll
make it install it we got a split
going now that times 50
states and break out at the states in
different areas that's the model we're
shooting for to be able to grow and
expand this totally aside from or we'll
get that first and then we'll work with
Home Depot saying hey we're going to
give you so much service give me an
extra
discount right for all the materials
things they'll be
buying so still in its infancy I'd say
here's what I would do if I were you
unsolicited you might think it's a bad
idea but since you have the Instagram
following I would make like a course or
something even if it's just a PDF
doesn't have to be fancy just like your
whole business plan basically it

[20:00]
whole business plan basically it
includes the plans it includes
everything and that's just like a lower
tier offer and then I would also offer
an inperson training course so I know a
guy that that sells in-person epoxy
flooring training in Pennsylvania and he
ends up he ended up making a ton more on
the training business than he does on
the epoxy flooring business so he
literally has a retail store for epoxy
flooring he installs it himself and then
he has a training business or at least
he did originally but at this point he
only does the training business and so
basically the second Tuesday of every
month he'll have a couple dozen people
fly in from all over the world they'll
spend two or three days there and he'll
charge them like five grand to show them
how to install it all the ticks the tips
and tricks all the things to avoid and
then they'll go back home and then
they'll start their business and it's
not a franchise it's not even a
licensing agreement so he doesn't have
to worry about those expenses or
legalities they'll start their business
half of them don't even start start a
business cuz human nature but he still

[21:01]
business cuz human nature but he still
collects his five grand and then when
they buy their epoxy they buy it from
him they don't have to but most of them
do because it's a good price and they
know and trust the guy and they shook
his hand and they met him right and so
I'm thinking of a situation where you
could have a quarterly in-person
training there in in Utah people could
fly in you could post about it and for
all the people that yeah it's a lot of
friction it's a lot of money it's you
know travel cost for all the people that
don't want to do that you could sell
them the $100 course or $500 course but
you could say listen for the people that
fly out here in person they're going to
be like authorized installers for me
because of the leverage that you have
with your Instagram account you will be
getting leads in skty and Seattle and
Tacoma all over people that want shelves
and if you had a guy come to your
training and gave you $5,000 by default
he can be like an authorized installer
and if you have another guy in Seattle
that just gave you $200 for the course

[22:00]
that just gave you $200 for the course
he's on his own right because he he
didn't pay you as much and you frankly
you don't know how good of an installer
he is because he didn't go to your
training so that could be an incentive
for someone to spend the two three four
$5,000 because you can send them jobs
and you don't have to guarantee them
jobs you could say listen I might not
get a lead in SKC for a year but when I
do you're my guy and then you can take a
cut of the lead you could process the
payment you could pass 90% of it on to
them so you can make money training them
and then you can make money on installs
happening all over the country that you
don't have to manage and then if you can
even work into your contract where if
they screw something up a complaint
comes back to you you could cut them out
of the network if they're not doing a
good job right I love it thank you what
would you say to other people that want
to do like a similar business based on
Facebook Marketplace it might not be a
shelf business but I always tweet about
the power of Facebook Marketplace and
how people sleep on it they don't have
any idea how much opportunity there is
there and you picked one of 10,000

[23:01]
there and you picked one of 10,000
different verticals what about the other
9,999 what advice would you give to
people that want to at least validate an
idea or fully fledged launch a business
on Facebook Marketplace well one step
prior to Facebook just any idea just for
any of those that are looking to do
anything any business I think the
biggest hurdle that you can
overcome is the fear of what's going to
happen happen you know mhm many of
people make excellent pastries or
cookies or they have a little hobby that
oh this is so cool and it's just whether
they oh what the fear of rejection
nobody's going want it or it's could to
be hard they don't want to take the risk
Fe you know fear that of the change or
what could happen I think that's the
biggest hurdle not to say we necessarily
had that it was more of let's just see
what happens we jumped we we'd already

[24:01]
what happens we jumped we we'd already
had that practice right but for anyone
just wanting to do something I'd say
that's the biggest thing now a solution
or a way around that
fear aside from just do it see what
happens what's the worst that can happen
think of it this way when I made the
first
shelf I got the money up front right I
got the deposit up front that paid for
the materials right then I just had to
deliver right what whatever fear or
nervousness of showing up and hey I'm
the Shelf dude let me make this shelf
for you was over in an hour as I made it
and boom I'm done and then my confidence
was boosted right after that first time
but fear I guess I don't know if this is
a fear fear of not having enough money
well you know make a good one sell it
get a couple orders and that then pays
for
the way you can it pays for itself right

[25:01]
the way you can it pays for itself right
you don't necessarily have to go out and
take a a $110,000 loan to do a business
you can start with one and you grow it
how many shelves are you installing per
month right now the average is about 20
nice kind of all ranges but most popular
is at 4 by five just because that's good
it tends to handle all the variation of
bins that people have collected over
their many years that's roughly what it
fits into into okay have you thought of
offering ancillary services like uh like
garage organization as an upsell I have
thought about that and whether or not
because I've tried to not tried but I've
contacted a couple garage cleaning
organizing services to offer my shelves
as part of their offering just so I can
just provide more shelves I do like the
membership or just the service model of
cleaning that's just compared to what
I'm doing the shelf's going to last

[26:00]
I'm doing the shelf's going to last
forever unless you buy other house or
want more storage we one and done right
and so it's not necessar the best
business model it's it's just a
different business model than the
membership service type thing definitely
have thought about it but just haven't
really acted on it yeah you could
Outsource it to someone that's already
doing it and just take a cut I'm I'm
even thinking of the idea of like is
there an industry that you could invent
that's like quarterly garage cleaning
right kind of like what you referenced
where not house cleaning not weekly not
monthly because it it doesn't need it
that much but I'll clean my garage and
six months later I I have to do it again
I wonder if people would pay for that
and at least you have a database of
customers that care about their garage
you could at least send an email and ask
sure sure no yeah I there's been a
couple of companies that I've I've done
that with do that specific thing so it's
goes back to you can sell anything you
can sell anything right yeah people are

[27:00]
can sell anything right yeah people are
willing to pay for for anything if it's
hard if it's difficult they don't want
to do it you know I always think of that
that the what was it a Pixar movie
Robots see a need feel a need well any
other thoughts or questions I appreciate
your time I where can people find you if
they want to like buy your plans or
anything the shelf.com is the best place
to find us or Instagram the Shelf dude
it's kind of the old logo but it's now a
circle with a shelf did in it you should
recognize me obviously I'm the face of
that as well as the website my phone
numberers there available as well give
me a call we can chat about any
solution find the plans if you want to
DIY it yourself it's not that hard but
you know whether you don't have time
that or or the money or the tools that's
where you'd reach out to me I can
service you that way but yeah that's
those are the best places to find me and
I really enjoy making shelves for people
I I love the creation part of it the

[28:01]
I I love the creation part of it the
building part of it and whether it's
building a house or building something
that just has some use it's really
satisfying yeah and it all happened all
this happened because you saw a video of
someone making these shelves and you
thought I could do that that's how it
always starts right like what if I what
if I did that got to be a little curious
and and a little confident so yeah a
little willing to risk it and see what
happens yeah okay well thank you Alex
appre appreciate your time I appreciate
it Chris thanks so much all right what'
you think that was Alex Hansen you can
find him at the shelf.com and we'll see
you next time
