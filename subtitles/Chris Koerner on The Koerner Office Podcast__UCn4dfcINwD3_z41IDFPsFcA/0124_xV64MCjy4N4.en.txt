so this British guy bought 200 Land
Rover defenders in 2015 right as they
stopped being manufactured he paid about
40 Grand each for them and they've been
sitting in storage ever since now today
he's making modifications to them and
selling them for 200 Grand each fortune
favors the bold and I love to see it
