[00:00]
I post on Facebook Marketplace all the time to
try to validate ideas I posted a simple ad that
said rent a washer and dryer month to month I went
on a cruise for 7 days and I came back and there
was a lot of interest I went and bought $330,000
worth of washers and dryers I just want all the
haters to listen up what about insurance what do
you about this you going to have a contract what
just freaking buy it throw it on your porch and
people will venmo you like that's probably the
reason that 90% of people would never start this
didn't know what I was doing just figured out as
I was going and that's what business is you're
just solving problems big [Music] deal my name
is Kyler Liston I live in orm Utah I'm 23 and
one year ago I started a washer and dryer rental
business I don't do anything full-time but that is
one of the major sources of money in my life right
now okay what was the triggering event that made
you say huh there there could be something here
I'm a big believer in taking off opportunities
and creating your own luck so I'd say it kind

[01:03]
of started my grandparents own a lot of rentals
did a lot of Maintenance they slowly said we're
not doing any washers and dryers so I knew there
there was at least 30 apartments that didn't have
washers and dryers then I also started delivering
third party for some companies in Utah County
delivering appliances and kind of learned how to
install them how to change the plugs the common
issues with them and how to fix some of them and
then I mean I'm a pretty observant whatever person
and I just started thinking that there's probably
a lot of people that there's a lot of apartments
that don't offer washers and dryers but the main
thing was I I mean I I I've done this a thousand
times but I just posted on Facebook Marketplace I
post on Facebook Marketplace all the time to try
to validate ideas I posted a simple ad that said
rent to washer month to month I went on a cruise

[02:02]
for seven days and I came back and there was
a lot of a lot of interest okay I want to get
hyp specific go back to your grandparents what was
the conversation what happened when did you first
learn that this might be an opportunity I don't
know if the exact moment my very first business
idea when I got home from a mission was I started
renting nine squares if you've seen the N9 Square
in the air games that are like the PVC pipes I
was like if I buy a if I buy a legit one which
cost $800 could I rent this out so I posted it
for a week got a lot of hits and I bought it and
everyone's like you're never gonna make your money
back which I made my money back times times a lot
there's a business there there's a n first of all
I think most people outside of the church don't
even know that exists I've only seen it in the
context of church so big in Utah County okay so
it's a PV C Contraption that's nine it's 3x3 nine
squares and people stand in it and they're like

[03:06]
hitting a ball over the PVC pipes right yep and
there were people renting them out but they were
all homemade PVC ones and there's one company who
makes legit like fittings that lock in and they
don't unconnect and it is pricey but I bought that
one which made me stand apart from everyone else
and then yeah that was my first thing and then I
always just liked I was just always thinking like
what else could I rent out so I got some paddle
boards from Al Sporting Goods rented out lots
of paddle boards and then I was always looking at
websites of like what could I rent out because you
have to be you have to be different from everyone
and at some point whether I saw it somewhere which
I don't think I did but at some point I was like
oh I wonder if I could rent a washer and dryer
back to the nine square how much did you rent them
for I I started renting them like between 30 it

[04:00]
was like $30 on a weekday and $50 for a weekend
around around there okay and you got your money
back yeah I mean I don't know how I mean it would
make several hundred dollar a month it got to the
point where it like paid itself completely times
a couple times and then I was just like I don't
really need to do this so I kind of have stopped
I mean I rented it a couple times this summer but
like I literally I would leave it on my porch then
they'd come get it they'd Veno me and I never did
like I never did anything no contracts no they
never signed anything and it never got broken or
stolen or anything beauty of living in beautiful
Utah oh I just want all the haters to listen up
not that there are any haters listening to this
but like what about insurance what you about this
who's who's you got to have a contract what just
frecking buy it throw it on your porch and people
will venmo you like you've had one set of washer
and dry are stolen in a year that's probably the

[05:01]
reason that 90% of people would never start this
and it's it's a nothing burger oh exactly yeah
there's a lot of pessimistic people that are like
well what I mean so exactly one Thanksgiving ago
like we have our big family Thanksgiving and at
that point I had put out one set and I like my
family knows me as like the entrepreneur kid or
whatever and I was like telling everyone like I
think this is going to be awesome and my parents
do support me but there was a lot of people that
were like that sounds like a ball in chain like
good luck like you're never going to be able
to leave again what if this happens what if this
happens or whatever I'm just anytime I bring any
idea to anyone it's a bunch of hate I feel like
it's like well what if this happens worst case
scenario and I'm just like hey well every business
sucks so like just figure it out yeah every time
I tweet about a business idea I hear the same
things and it's like yeah that's an obstacle to
overcome that's a problem to solve that's and
that's what business is you're just solving
problems big deal okay for sure yeah like that's
such a critical framework when starting a business

[06:03]
like I really feel like you you do yourself
more harm than good when you solicit opinions
from anyone because everyone's biased you tell
your friend or your buddy and he's jealous he's
going to tell you it's dumb because he's jealous
he doesn't want to succeed and or he wants to copy
you if you tell it to your mom she's going to
tell you it's amazing because she loves you and
you can do no wrong like how do you actually get
real feedback there's only one way you post the
Facebook Marketplace exactly does the market tell
you what does the free capitalistic Market tell
you that like the first step is almost always try
to get a customer go to Facebook Marketplace go
validate it put up a landing page wait for your
first dollar and then everything else can follow
yes I agreee 100% I like to do things and then
and then tell people about them like you don't
have to tell me about what could be wrong because
I already am doing it and it's not happening yep
that's why like of all these businesses
I've built I never ever ever talked about
on my Facebook page like 10 years ago I would post
a Facebook about normal family stuff I would never

[07:05]
talk about businesses and outwardly my excuse
was well I don't want to have to start a business
that's reliant on my friends and family I want
it to stand on its own but yeah the real reason
honestly the real reason is I was insecure about
what people would think or say and I was insecure
that the idea would fail and then I'd have to come
crawling back to my Facebook friends as if I have
as if I owe them anything thing it's like hey
that thing I posted about it failed like first
of all no one ever no one would ever remember that
you started it in the first place no one cares no
one's thinking about you you just do your own
thing whether you post about it or not for sure
and I guess my biggest thing is I've heard you
say once that like people think you're a big risk
taker but it's like a very calculated risk and
I think it was the same way for me I was doing
the math and saying worst case scenario I'll make
my money back and I don't actually see any risk
I did Summer sales I took my money and I went and
bought $30,000 worth of washers and dryers I gave

[08:06]
it to some guy and I was like order me a bunch
of sets and I was like I I didn't even have 30
customers or whatever I just like I based off the
one week of demand I've seen there will be enough
to get those all rented out and these were brand
new sets who's a guy what guy do you give 30 grand
to who was this guy you find him on Craigslist
there's like three or four wholesale places in
Utah and I mean would always just say hey like
I'm a property manager like I'm looking for like
50 sets what's the discount and I found a guy that
had a had a a good price and I I mean eventually
he he knows I'm not a property manager when I
walk in 20 years old yeah and so I so I bought
those and what I'm trying to say though is that
in my mind it wasn't a risk at in my mind it's
always I was gonna break even at least yeah it's
like the the guys that take the huge risks right

[09:01]
like Elon mus sells Tesla he gets 140 million
bucks he pushes it he sells PayPal gets 140
million pushes all into Tesla that's a massive
risk that makes the headlines we all know about
him but the Average Joe's like you and I everyone
listening that are starting businesses most of us
are much more calculated than people like to
think we're just better at doing research and
when I say doing research we're posting stuff
to Facebook yeah exactly and I there was always
the fear of like what if someone steals it but
then it's just I just don't think you should live
your life thinking that cuz like you could say
that about a lot of businesses why don't people
just go around like stealing and killing people
because people have morals and most people have
morals yeah so you bought 30 sets for $30,000 it
was a little bit more than 30 sets I would think
so do you remember how many it was so the very
first one like I got home from the cruise and
I had like people that wanted them installed I
bought those on from RC Willie which is like a

[10:02]
box store in Utah for everyone pretty it's very
pricey I knew that was not the route I wanted
to go but I had to I wanted to like get those I
think I did three you're validating the idea yeah
I wanted to do three from RC Willie I did three
from RC Willie and then I was trying to figure
out how to get them cheaper how much were they the
ones from RC Willie they were like I want to say
like $1,100 gez were they used or new they were
brand new and they come come with a warranty were
these like high efficiency or like your ugly white
ones no these are like the I mean they're pretty
nice they have a glass top they're LG uh machines
I mean they're the they're basic but yeah they're
they look they look really nice real quick is
that like a freeze dryer over your shoulder yeah
I'm like this is the most LDS household I've ever
seen in my life yeah I all of my family lives on
one pretty much one street and I I'm at I met my
grand grandparents and they're big my grandma's

[11:02]
a big freeze dryer live I wish I had one of those
that looks awesome it looks like a washer all day
every day she's she's freeze drying fruit and food
I believe the the new ones were around $800 so the
way I did my math was okay so my in my head my
ideal client was someone moves into an apartment
they sign a one-year lease they don't have a
washer and dryer and I wanted to make my price
for renting for a year a little bit cheaper but
the same cost as like buying buying one I want it
to be a little bit cheaper so they could in their
head be like I'm I am saving money so that's how
I came up with like the60 to $85 because at the
end of the 12 months they had paid off off the
machine after I did install the 30 brand new ones
I was like why don't I do used ones and the used
ones they are probably a lot better business model
in my opinion it doesn't seem like people demand

[12:02]
them any less like they're still in high demand no
yeah I think it's so all I did was like I changed
what I was doing the new ones for up like $25 and
I just did the used ones for the same price and it
was the same same de they just want to they they
just want a washer and dryer that that works and
cleans their clothes yeah period okay let me back
up real quick you got 30 grand from Summer sales
what percentage of like your savings was that at
the time I think I had like maybe 60 Grand so it
was like half half of the savings just all just
just giv up yeah half of your life savings on some
used washers and dryers Based on data points from
one Facebook Marketplace post and I'm not making
fun of you I would do the same thing and it worked
so hindsight is 2020 well the other thing is like
the whole time it's like if this fails all I
did is I lost to Summer knocking doors like
worst case scenario that worst case I lose three
months of my entire life in the hot sun selling

[13:03]
things that's kind of bad but no I mean worst
cases you just you sell those sets individually
on Facebook Marketplace and you probably make a
profit yeah you just sell them there's a lot of
different ways I looked at it yeah yeah okay all
right so you started with the more expensive ones
and you learned there's no point in this people
just want reliable ones that work even if they're
ugly 60 bucks a pop what did it look like to go
from those first 30ish units to the next best
what did scaling look like like what different
kind of tiers did you hit in your business along
the way I completely like bootstrapped it or
whatever like my first one I heard and made
a Google doc made a contract and it was like pay
me through venmo PayPal PayPal or zel or whatever
and then they would Circle which one they'd pay me
and I would text them like hey today's your time
to pay or whatever and they would pay me and
I was like if I want to scale this I need to
not text a whole bunch of people so then I got
stripe so it's all through subscriptions it's

[14:08]
collects their credit card I tried to start
collecting two credit cards so if one fails
I can just charge the other card well it's funny
because that's usually that's not something that
most business owners have to even think about
if this card fails then we need a backup but in
this demographic that's fairly common I imagine
yeah more common than average yeah probably yeah
and I mean the whole entire time I mean I was
kind of scared of like it was kind of a very hard
balance of like this is an experiment and do I
keep scaling it and going bigger or do I find out
if this works and so I think the first like four
or five months I was still like really like how
much bigger do I want to go before I find out like
if this is going to work like how long are these
machines GNA last and how much of a headache is it
and going into it the whole entire time I was like
if I can make 10 grand a month I don't care how
much of a he headache it is in my 23 23 year old

[15:05]
mind it was like if I could make 10 grand a month
I don't care if I'm working all day on this and it
has I I don't thankfully have to work all day how
much are you working on this business would you
say not very much maybe five on a busy week maybe
10 hours a week two out of the six days I mean I
do work on Saturday sometimes so maybe two out of
the six days I will go install one or go pick one
up or go clean one or go knock on someone's door
or something if you really wanted to to scale it
you could spend all you know full time on it so
what's interesting I mean I don't think it's any
secret the guy I was talking to you about he so he
has seven over 700 sets he has no employees crazy
zero employees and according to him it is not
that big of a a pain time so I would go to some I
I started going to Property Management places and
saying like hey will you pass these out like can
you put these in the welcoming envelopes to your
new tenants or whatever and one or two of them

[16:04]
were like oh we already used this guy that's how
I found about this guy because I he doesn't have a
huge presence online so I I mean I called him and
just asked about his business and that was another
validation of like okay this guy's been doing it
for 10 years he has 700 sets after I heard about
that I was like okay this is kind of I think this
is going to I think this can work a lot of my fear
went away after I learned about a guy who was
doing it and he was making money I did not know
about this guy at all before I started it though
and then it turns out he was tell me about the the
time that you spent what was it delivering units
for the the warehouses yeah I want to hear how
people could emulate that in their local market
yeah so there's you have your big box stores like
loen Home Depot and then and I would say in most
cities there's probably a scratch and dent place
at least in or where I live there's probably
three or four pretty big ones within 15 or 20

[17:03]
minutes they buy Scratch and Dent from like Costco
and all of these big places but they don't want
anything they don't actually really know anything
a lot of them don't have a ton of knowledge about
washers and dryers they're just buying buying them
and they do not want to have anything to do with
the install so what I did is I just went to those
places asked if I could put my phone number there
then when someone goes and buys a fridge they
buy a washer and dryer they don't have a truck
or anything but they would like to have a cheaper
option then going to Lowe's or whatever so they
go to the scratch and dent then they would call
me and I would deliver them and it was honestly a
very in my mind it was a very good side hustle
once again didn't have insurance or anything
didn't know what I was doing just figured out as
as I was going no trailer just a pickup truck I
kind of lied to you when I told you I have a truck
my I mean my grandpa has three trucks so I used

[18:00]
his trucks a lot I did all of the installs in a
Toyota Highlander that I put a hitch on so not
even a truck just a Highlander with a trailer yep
no truck jeez and so you literally just went to
a a a washer dryer store and said let me do all
your deliveries and like okay they are actually
pretty open because they want to give their
customers as many options as possible so at
one of them I was like the first one to kind of
do it they don't want you to the their sole guy
really they want their customers to have as many
options so they they were all welcoming of like
yeah you can put our phone number here and then
as if you if you actually pick up your phone and
you put your prices there you will get most of
the work because a lot of people won't pick up
their phone and don't actually want to do it I
mean they're appliance repair places that are
doing repairs all day and they don't actually want
to deliver them I mean here's what I'm thinking
Plano Texas 250,000 people go to outs scraper run
it for Furniture Appliance anything that could

[19:01]
have big items run a scrape get all their phone
numbers call them up as if you're a consumer say
hey do you look at her couch deliver couches no
you got to arrange that yourself okay and then
just check a box on the spreadsheet for everyone
that does not deliver and then you drive there
to only those ones show up in person with a flyer
hey I do this is all I do you could have a dozen
stores referring business to you all day every
day oh yeah and I guess my biggest thing is is I
think there's a lot of levels of Entrepreneurship
and like there's probably a lot of people that
are doing way cooler and way more glamorous things
than me you maybe even at my age at 23 but there's
also a lot of people that are get that I know
that are my friends that are getting paid like
$14 an hour and hate their life the appliance
delivery I was charging between1 and $200 and
install and doing I mean there was a lot of days
where I'd make $400 or $500 and I was working for
myself and it was like in my opinion a lot better
than a lot of other people's reality some people

[20:02]
maybe don't think that's glamorous or whatever but
like in my mind it was like I would rather go do
one delivery for $200 and it takes me two hours
than go work for someone for $20 an hour all day
so yeah if there's I think that it's a good hustle
for someone who is like gets paid minimum wage and
they hate their life and they want to do something
and they have a dolly then they can do this
business and make I think you could make several
hundred dollars a day during the summer we did a
lot of fridges and I just did my little brother
who's 15 now and we just go deliver fridges and
every every fridge that was a French store was
like over $200 and they're already paying like
$1,200 for the fridge so it's nothing I'd give
my brother like 50 bucks he was making or $75 he
was making over $25 an hour as a 15-year-old he he
loved to take him to Chick-fil-A every every time
is good all right if you are watching this clip
right now you are watching this this on YouTube
and if you are a fan of podcast please check out
my podcast while you're at it because sometimes I

[21:03]
have podcasts that aren't on YouTube and sometimes
I have YouTubes that aren't on podcast so check
out the ker office on any podcast platform or
you can go to TKO pod.com also my newsletter will
throw that in there there are no ads It's weekly
it's different content than my podcast and YouTube
newsletter. chrisj cerner.com You'll see the link
and we'll see you there I don't even think this is
like a good option for someone working a crappy
job or minimum wage like anything can scale like
I will go to saying that anything can scale some
things are harder to scale uh but like the more we
move towards AI the more people enterprising
entrepreneurs like us are going to be moving
away from the sweaty startup that are outside that
means that we're going to be able to charge more
we're going to have fewer competitors it's just
going to get better the pie is getting bigger for
everyone as technology advances for sure yeah
that was the appliance delivery and that was a
that definitely helped me before I did that I mean
my Appliance rental business I had already inst
at least 100 washers and dryers okay and so with
the appliance delivery business you're charging

[22:06]
to both deliver it and install it almost always
yes that was my like upsells like a lot of some
people did like garage drop off but I'm like if
it's an old lady you drop it off of their garage
you did almost did them nothing they still have
no way to get in their house so I I would I would
put them in their house with the rental business
has there ever been a time when you felt unsafe
in these areas personally me no I mean where was
your mission again I was in Argentina and then
Co hit and then I was in California that's stuff
doesn't scare me at all I took my older brother
to some of them and he was he was sketched out
but I'm like this is this is West Valley yeah
we I did one install like two weeks ago in Rose
Park which I had always heard like Rose Park is
so dangerous and it was like the nicest couple
ever and they're like we want to run this for
the rest of our lives and I was like sounds good
so do most people end up having them for longer

[23:00]
than 6 or 12 months I mean I've only done it for a
year so I can't exactly say that but kind of back
to like being observant like I think most people
have the mentality of I'm going to only rent here
for one year but I think a lot of people end up
staying there for five years I don't know what
the percentage is but out of the 30 Apartments
my grandparents had there's probably 15 that
have been there for 15 years and yeah there's some
overturn for the other ones but there's a lot of
them that just they think they're going to rent
there for a year and then they raise their whole
family and and die in the apartment and I think
there are some people that from day one say I
will be renting this until I I die and I'm like
okay cool with me sounds good to me most people
listening to this or many people listening to this
they're thinking oh man that's that's that's sad
that what a waste of money because the alternative
to that is they could own their own unit and they
would just pay for it once but really the
alternative for them is the LA the laundr
map which is expensive and onerous and you're
carrying laundry all over the place and it's timec

[24:06]
consuming and most of the time depending on how
much laundry you have it's more expensive than $60
a month so yeah I mean that was the big response
from your from the Twitter was just like these
people are idiots for for renting and honestly
I think there's like five or six reasons why the
business works or like reasons why people do it a
I it is cheaper than the laundry m i mean multiple
people have said I spent over $100 a month and and
people in the Twitter was like well that's if you
have four kids I'm like yeah I'm in Utah everyone
has four like all of these people have four kids
it is cheaper than the laundry M even this week
I've had two people call and say I just bought a
washer and dryer off Facebook Marketplace it was
$400 it broke the next month and the guy blocked
me they're like oh jeez can you I mean a lot of
people do that they'll they'll sell a washer and
dryer and they don't want to be responsible for
whatever happens to it so those people are out

[25:04]
$400 and they don't have a washer and dryer and I
am just catering to the people who don't have any
trucks they don't have any way to deliver and they
just would they would rather have a working washer
and dryer and pay a monthly fee and know that it's
always going to work and if it breaks down that
the maintenance is is free in an ideal world like
they should all be able to get a be able to have
really good credit and be able to do a financing
option and buy their own and maybe have a similar
thing but like that's not reality not everyone has
good credit and they they can't do that and I mean
what's funny to me after because I thought about
it a lot is like every business you're buying
something for more than what it's worth so like I
sold Pest Control why does anyone do Pest Control
the chemicals cost $5 chemicals we used yeah
average treatment with the truck and the employee

[26:00]
and everything was $32 and you would charge that
person $150 or $180 that's every business the the
chemicals for a pool cleaning cost $5 too I bet
and I guarantee you pay $100 so like yeah I'm I
own a business you're gonna pay me honestly it's
for the convenience yeah it's for the convenience
of having washing dryer free install and people
that yes Sly there are people that that live month
to month but their other option is just spending
more money at the laundry map so anyways that's
my that's my Soap Box on like why it works well
the fact of the matter is financial education is
terrible in America and so because of that we have
a large percentage of Americans that make poor
financial choices Honestly by no fault of their
own they grew up with parents that did the same
thing they didn't learn any better in school and
that's the hand that we're dealt right and so you
can do one of two things you can say say I'm not
going to be in affordable housing I'm not going to

[27:00]
touch that I don't want to be a slum Lord like you
could say that the reason is for ethical reasons
or just for headache reasons or you could say h
the less good guys there are in this business the
higher percentage of bad guys there are in this
business making bad decisions that are in their
best interest the higher percentage of people
that are taking advantage of people that live
in poverty right yeah and so we can either just
throw our hands up and say ah it's a shame no one
knows any Financial education no one even knows
what a credit score is they make dumb purchases
people are so dumb people are so dumb why do they
do that well they don't want to do that right like
they're born into that situation they're kept in
that situation and we can either turn our heads
or we can donate to Charities or we can start
a business in that space and commit to being a
good guy right maybe an RV park maybe it's your
business and we can not be a piece of crap and
take good care of people and treat them like
we would treat any other customer and any other
industry I was going to pull up a picture on my
phone because I think a lot of people think I'm

[28:01]
renting to like the hood which I don't even know
what the hood in Utah looks like but I would say
almost 50% of them are one to two year old brand
new town homes in either Vineyard Eagle Mountain
in Saratoga Springs like these are brand new
people these are brand new homes I bet the people
are paying over $2,000 a month in rent they don't
want to deal with they don't want think about it
dryer and I mean even on Facebook Marketplace like
it was a little a bit discouraging like I'd say
for a while once a week IID get someone cussing
me out saying you're you're an idiot you're a
[ __ ] who's going to do this and I was like all
right but like I'm already doing it and people
are are doing it my other thing was I only needed
1% of Utah County to to do it for it to work and
yeah I mean there's yeah I only needed less than
1% really for it to make sense to me it's funny
because Nick my business partner he he always
buys new vehicles brand new off a lot and I've
never done that well I did with my Tesla but other
than that I I would never do that it's the worst

[29:03]
decision ever right you want to buy a car that's
like one to four years old still under warranty
but it's already depreciated I've been telling
him this and his excuse is his reason is really
good he's like I grew up poor my dad was always
tinkering with cars our car was always breaking
down it was unreliable broken down on the side of
the road stressful walking home and I don't want
to ever deal with that I don't want to ever think
about that so yeah I'm paying a premium to buy a
brand new car off the lot it's a poor financial
decision I know it is but I don't want to have
to deal with it I don't want to think about it
so there's literally no difference between that
decision and the decision that your customers are
making this is going to sound maybe controversial
of what I said before but like it is surprising
how how do I word this without being offensive
people okay this is just an example so dryers
they have two different types of cords there's
a three-prong cord and a four-prong cord I think
anything any house built after 1996 has to have

[30:05]
the new the new chord anything before that has the
old chord if someone bought it's a very easy what
I'm trying to say is if someone bought the wrong
cord I would say like maybe 60% of the population
would have no idea how to unscrew the cord and
put the the new one on like that's the kind of
people I'm dealing with they have no idea how
to like grab a channel and put the hose on they
don't know how to clamp anything like they don't
own a drill they don't own anything so those are
the people that are just like yeah I I'm not
a handy man I'm not going to install my washer
and dryer to me it's Common Sense yeah I I get
it and I'm on that Spectrum somewhat because I
don't I'm not super handy but at the end of the
day I learned like it's a lot more convenient to
be handy like I I have a couple bikes you know
a mountain bike and a road bike and they break
down and I'm driving them back and forth to the
bike shop and then I just learned how to do it
and it just for convenience sake you know oh
yeah I want to ask some nuts and bolts about the

[31:03]
business but before I do how would you address the
common haters in the comments that say like why
this wouldn't work we had talked about before
the call like what are the top four top five
reasons that people think this is dumb and what
are your rebuttal to those we kind of went over
the first one the first rebuttal is just like no
one's going to do this and I mean the rebuttal is
they they are it's the simple reasons that yeah
I already explained that part second rebuttal
is probably like okay well what if something
happens for some reason there's a misconception
misconception that insurance costs like tens of
thousands of dollars which it doesn't someone on
your Twitter said like this guy's for sure not
legal he's not insured yep I wasn't insured for
two months I got three quotes I have a $2 million
policy 1 million is like if someone steps on a
screw and wants to sue me and the other million
dollars is if I flood a whole apartment complex
and I'm responsible for it the whole policy
for the whole year is like $600 yep so that's

[32:05]
my rebuttal to like well what if you flood
something okay well I have insurance and also
you own Apartments if someone like this happened
to my Dad's apartment last week like they didn't
they installed the washer dryer themselves they
didn't hook up the hose or tighten it it flooded
the apartment and what I'm trying to say is like
I I will take responsibility cuz I installed it
but like also the tenant is responsible for if if
something got flooded in your rental you wouldn't
it would most likely you would look back at the at
the renter and they wouldn't even be responsible
you would just do it okay so that's the second one
is they think that I'm G to burn a house down or
whatever you just buy insurance that's my simple
rebuttal it's not that not that expensive yeah
third one is someone's going to steal it we kind
of went over it like yeah someone could steal it
there's a ways around it you could put air tags
in them you could put tracking devices in them

[33:00]
you could do more creative things or you could
just say they're not going to steal it and if
they do it's the same exact model what I'm doing
is the same exact model as single family homes on
a different on a really small scale if you have a
100 of them that's great 90 five of them are going
to be awesome five of them are going to trash your
apartment and you're going to lose a lot of money
but as long as you have enough if someone steals
them then you have enough that it it doesn't
matter you just added into your business math that
one's gonna get stolen or two is GNA get stolen I
don't know fourth robutt let's see what else do
people say I mean a lot of people were saying
like oh they worry about like the deliveries
I sent you that video of the cart that was
the best $800 I ever spent on Amazon so for the
first six months me and my brother would install
them after school after he was done with school
and anything over the Second Story I couldn't
do by myself and so I'd always ask him like are
there stairs in your house if so I have to do it
at five o'clock there's a something called a stair
climber Dolly and it just has rotating things it

[34:03]
can lift 800 pounds you just push a button it
lifts them all up and I use it for every single
install I've done every install by myself since
then for the last six months beautiful those are
the main rebuttal I can't think of any others
right now I mean there's a lot of like I guess
some of the pains are you are dealing with some
maybe lower class people their credit cards do get
declined some people do change their phone numbers
and don't let me know there's a lot of ways you
could get around that but everyone I've dealt
with you just text them and say hey your credit
card was declined like do you want to add another
card or can you stop or are you like done renting
or what's the deal and everyone has responded
and has been easy to easy to work with and then
another thing I'm going to mention is that I
am not the slum I've never charged a late fee
on anyone they're supposed to pay at first it was
like $10 if they had a late fee all I care about

[35:04]
is if they communicate with me I'll never charge
a late fee some people are a month behind like I
would rather than pay it's easier for them for me
to just wait and pay than it is for me to go get
their washer and dryer so as long as they are
committed to keep paying I will never charge a
late fee they're also supposed to rent it for
six months if they rent it for two months and
say they're done they're supposed to pay $50 I've
never charged anyone that like I've never charged
a late fee in the mobile home park business either
like and I don't tell them that up front we put
late fees in the contract if they ghost me I'm
like all or nothing right if they ghost me they
won't answer their phone they're late they're not
they're not making any communication then I have
to evict them I have to exactly I'm not in the
late fee business that's not how we make money
we just we charge rent that's that's the same same
model as long as they communicate when they start
ghosting me then I'm like I'm going to come knock
your door but as long as you text me then I don't

[36:02]
care when when you pay as long as you you pay yeah
because ghosting almost always means they're not
going to pay right yeah lightning round what what
are the tools you need to run this business as far
as like Hardware I mean you need probably like a
hundred maybe not even 100 maybe like $75 worth of
tools for blows probably not even 75 maybe like 50
$50 you need some basic tools screwdrivers channel
locks some type of moving cart uh way to transport
whether that's a truck or a trailer most cars can
actually pull a trailer they have a capacity of at
least a th000 pounds which that's all the washer
and dryer weighs they only weigh a couple hundred
so you can put it hitch on most cars for $400 and
buy a trailer for probably a thousand as far
as other things I mean you need some type of
contract you need some type of payment processor
I would say some place to store at least two to
three sets the storage facility is typ Al just
the apartments you're renting in but there is

[37:00]
sometimes some overturn of between four and five
machines that they're done renting and you don't
have someone rented out so you need some space
and that's really it I mean it's a pretty pretty
basic business is there anything you would have
done differently if you could start this over
from scratch again I would not have bought as many
new ones probably well okay yeah I bought a lot of
I bought a lot of new ones and I think there's
pros and cons the new ones are going to last a
lot longer without about needing maintenance I
used a lot of money when I could have probably
scaled I probably could have scaled to the point
I'm at with like half the money how often do you
have to fix these things or how often can you
just walk someone through it over the phone the
used ones do have more maintenance because you're
buying so there's like a lot of weird stuff about
washers and dryers they're actually like made to
break now I guess like they are not very very good
but the square ones that Whirlpool made they owned
all of them they owned like May tag and everyone

[38:02]
and they made the same washer and dryer they're
all interchangeable parts those ones are really
easy to work on and what's really nice is there's
two websites there's one called Repair Clinic and
one called applian repair.com I think you type in
the serial the model number it has every single
model number that's ever been created and it has
like 30 videos for each one of like okay if it's
if the if it's not here's one of the nine problems
it can be and then it has a part number you copy
and paste that part number into Amazon and it's
like a third of the price as the website and you
can fix you can fix everything I I probably get
maybe maybe it would average out to one call a
week but I don't think it would even be that much
WoW out of a 100 units there's not that much that
can go wrong like a dryer if you actually take
it apart it's literally just a motor that spins
the barrel with a belt so as long as your motor
is working and the motor turns on the heating

[39:00]
element so there's only like two things that and
the heating element's like $12 on Amazon jeez so
they're pretty there's not a lot of Maintenance
and back to the ball and chain thing I like I
lived a completely normal life this year like I
went to Colombia in April I went to California
for a week I went and picked pine nuts for three
months all all this business was was doing this
and if anyone wants to scale it like all you have
to do is find on Facebook find someone who sells
a lots of washers and dryers they're most likely
no how to fix them as well and just contact them
and say hey like build a relationship with them
and say hey like I are you someone I can call to
come go fix these when I'm not there so I have
a really good relationship with someone in Utah
that when I'm not there they'll and they'll fix
machines replace machines and do everything and
they charge me maybe $75 to $100 per thing but
I wouldn't do anything for less than $100 so

[40:05]
yeah yeah so they they shouldn't either okay
Kyler this is great I think people are excited
about this I just got an email an hour ago
from a guy that was wanting to know when it
would be released where can people find you
I'm gonna make a a landing page but at the
moment I have a really really ghetto website
that is okay it's called Utah appliance rental
and my I mean my cell phone number is the cell
phone number that's on the business and also
there's a form that you can fill out it'll think
you're renting a washer and dryer but there's also
a ad comment so you can add whatever whatever
you want there Utah appliance ral.com beautiful
website beautiful business half of it doesn't
work but the other the other half does it it's
good enough where people can fill out a form and
they actually do fill out fill out the form and
I've gotten quite a few few leads from it okay all
right well thanks man awesome thank you Chris all
