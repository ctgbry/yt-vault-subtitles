here's exactly how to make 240 Grand a
year with no money and no experience now
you tell me where my logic is flawed
every day in America 2,000 business
owners are retiring and they need
someone to sell their business but guess
what you don't want to be a business
broker cuz that is a sucky job you want
to be a business broker's broker here's
what I mean by that when a business
owner goes to sell let's say it's a
million-dollar business a broker will
charge him 8% to sell that business but
he will pay as a referral fee 25% % of
his commissions which is 2% of the total
purchase price so if you find business
owners in Facebook groups cold calling
cold emailing cold texting that are
ready to sell their business then place
them with a broker get them to sign a
referral agreement and you will make 20
grand just for making the connection
make one deal a month and you will make
$240,000 a year how do I know this is
viable because I've done it myself
