You could make 10k a day doing the 100
bucks a pop for 100 people. The worst
one I've done made 40 grand. This will
probably bring us between 25 and $45,000
of net profit and we're subbing
everything out. This was an idea that we
talked about on the podcast and we're
totally cool with people copying us
because law of abundance and all that.
Please go look, go copy me. Also, if
anyone wants to buy my treeming
business, fasttree.com, I'm selling it
because James is doing this now. that's
simple to build. And
what if you were forced to make $10,000
in a day, a week, a month, or a year?
What if you didn't have a choice? Well,
today my friend Brandon and I break down
a bunch of ideas that we would launch if
we had to make $10,000 within each of
those four time frames. We also talked
about things that we're building and or
launching and or tinkering with right
now. This is a certified banger. Please
share with a friend. All right, so I've
got Brandon here, my friend, my business
partner. We recorded two months ago and

[01:00]
partner. We recorded two months ago and
the audio failed and it was a banger and
it was so good we're taking the time to
sit down and re-record the whole thing.
Isn't that right, Brandon?
&gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah, that audio was my
fault. I apologize.
&gt;&gt; Okay, so there's also been an update.
One of the ideas we spoke about back in
August. I've actually launched. I liked
it so much I launched it and I'm going
to share my screen and show everyone how
I'm getting leads, how we're treating
the leads, and I'm really, really
excited about it. So, that is a 10K in a
day idea. So, we'll cover that at the
end. And let's start, Brandon, with how
some awesome ways to make $10,000 in a
year. Okay. So, I was trying to think of
how could you capitalize off of existing
audiences that are super dieh hard. So,
I thought of a few ideas. One would be
board games. So, there's a big cohort of
people that love board games. I love
board games. There are people that are
absolutely obsessed though. They love to
play. They love to track. They love to
track who played with who and when and

[02:00]
track who played with who and when and
who won and all that kind of stuff. They
love to rate them. You can find large
subreddits of people that are just, you
know, dedicated to board games, not to
mention endless Facebook groups. So, I
think that one could vibe code an app
for board game lovers that is just the
sort of CRM, personal CRM of everything
board games where they can do all the
tracking. They can set up, you know,
game meetings with their friends. They
can do whatever. It wouldn't be hard to
vibe code this app and, you know, charge
10 bucks a month. And you don't need
that that many people to hit 10K a year
to do that. So, what do you think of
that one?
&gt;&gt; I love it. Why don't you explain to
everyone what you understand vibe coding
to mean?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sorry. So, for those who don't
know, vibe coding would be using a a
tool like Replet or or Claude or Chat
GPT where you use natural language, the
way you just speak to code app. And then

[03:02]
way you just speak to code app. And then
it could be a web app or it could be an
actual like iOS, you know, iPhone app.
But the rate that these tools have been
improving, it's like I don't know how to
code at all. I don't even know HTML. And
I already have an app that's live in the
app store. So it is for sure doable with
some effort to get apps live, even if
you don't know how to code at all.
&gt;&gt; I pulled up a subreddit for board games
that has 533,000
members. Woo. So, not to mention Board
Gaming, which has another 54,000 weekly
visitors just in that one. So, there are
600,000 dieh hard people that love board
games so much that they're in a
subreddit just for that. I love this
idea. It's simple and it has a very,
very passionate audience. And I think it
rides the title wave of AI because it's
anti- AI. It's in person. It's physical.
It's, you know, and I'm very bullish on

[04:01]
It's, you know, and I'm very bullish on
that stuff and I'm I've talked about it
a lot, so I won't go into it. And it's
simple. It's simple to build. And I was
just reading about Reddit advertising,
how much better it's gotten. They have a
new CEO and it's gotten a lot better.
It's got because it's Reddit advertising
has never been effective. Like that's
always been its downfall. And I think
they've gotten a little more innovative.
And so this could be your opportunity to
find two subreddits like these and just
go hard on ads.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And if you lean into the ad as
well, the ad could be like, "I hate it
when my friends don't remember the score
of last week's game."
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; Like something like that and everyone's
every because that would resonate with
everyone in that subreddit.
&gt;&gt; It's funny because a lot of times we
build little apps like these and we add
these little random cute little features
that we think, "Oh, people will people
will think this is cute and then like
the feature ends up becoming the main
thing."
&gt;&gt; Yeah. You know, Slack started as a video
game and they built this amazing
interface, this chat interface to use as
you were playing the video game and then
the video game just sucked. But everyone

[05:01]
the video game just sucked. But everyone
loved the chat and so they're like,
"Whoa, whoa, whoa. We let's do something
with this chat chat. Like, let's let's
unbundle this and make it its own
thing." And now it's a billion dollar
company.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's amazing. one note that you
said this piggybacks off of dieh hard
communities and then it's anti- AI right
like you could do this same idea but for
quilting patterns for quilters
&gt;&gt; they're also die hard anti-AI you could
do this for gardeners a gardening
journal where people are tracking you
know how well did their tomatoes grow
this year how many feet how many did
they produce what box did they plant it
in you know how much dirt or manure
whatever what was that, you know, sort
of combo that they did so they can
better know what to do next spring
that's also anti-AI and a dieh hard
group. So, there's lots of lots of
niches within this general idea that I
think you could attack.
&gt;&gt; I love it. I'm going to bring up an idea
that just came to mind that is not on
our list because we talked about Reddit

[06:01]
our list because we talked about Reddit
and Reddit, I said they have a new CEO,
that's wrong. They now have their
co-founder back at the helm as the CEO
and that triggered this memory because
the Reddit stock has been crushing,
right? Right. I don't own any, but I
know it's been crushing. It got it took
a big hit this week because there was an
SEO update, yada yada yada. We won't go
into that. But my idea, right, your idea
is this app. I have an app idea that I
think could make $10,000 a year or a
month in this case, but we're on the
year category, so I'll respect that. It
was all based on the thesis that stocks,
investing in stocks that have network
effects and are founderled outperform
the market by a significant margin.
Okay. For those listening, network
effects is the more people that use your
platform, the more valuable your
platform becomes. Bitcoin is network
effects, right? Like millions of people
hold Bitcoin and the more people that
hold Bitcoin, the more valuable Bitcoin
becomes because people are less likely
to sell it, right? Facebook network
effects, right? Like you all your
friends and family are on Facebook, so

[07:00]
friends and family are on Facebook, so
you're you know it's more it's more
valuable. Everyone's there, right? eBay
network effects. It's a marketplace
two-sided.
&gt;&gt; Etsy. Yeah,
&gt;&gt; Etsy. I don't remember where I learned
this, but a company that is founder-ledd
does better because it's incentives.
Like it's their baby. They want it to do
better. And then a company that has
network effects, it's a moat, right?
It's an impenetrable moat that only
grows as more people use it. So when you
put the two things together, you know, 1
plus 1 equals 10. So I vibe coded an app
called Neil, Network Effects, founder.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; And it was just for my own use because I
couldn't find a good system. Like I was
prompting chat GBT what are all the
stocks that are network effects founder
le but it's a spectrum right like maybe
&gt;&gt; Jeff Bezos isn't leading the company
anymore but he has a he has a lot of
control over the board that should be
somewhere on the spectrum and Amazon has
network effects right whereas Mark
Zuckerberg
&gt;&gt; that's a 10 out of 10
&gt;&gt; he's the founder he's the leader and it
has network effects right
&gt;&gt; and so I vibe coded this app that was

[08:01]
&gt;&gt; and so I vibe coded this app that was
very tedious that pulls from like Yahoo
Finance data where you can like there's
a slider on the spectrum of network
effects and founder led and then you can
back test it against the S&P 500 over
the last month, year, 10 years, hundred
years, whatever to say like, all right,
on the day that you know this company
that today is founder led and has
network effects, on the day they went
public, what would my returns have
looked like if I spent $100 on their IPO
verse $100 in the S&P?
&gt;&gt; And it's pretty like sophisticated. It
will, you know, you can back
&gt;&gt; That's awesome. Yeah,
&gt;&gt; it is. Let me You mind if I show you
real quick? I'm excited to see it.
&gt;&gt; Real quick, please subscribe to my
channel. I know it's kind of lame to
ask, but it means a lot. Thanks.
&gt;&gt; It would be cool if it would be good
enough eventually because I know you're
just you just only recently started
messing around with this. if it could
find and maybe it already can
opportunities in like industries that
you wouldn't normally think of like is
there an a network effect founderled
construction you know publicly traded
construction company that not

[09:02]
construction company that not
Caterpillar you know but something
smaller that I'd never heard of but that
it would be really appealing you know.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. That that is interesting.
&gt;&gt; All right. So this is it. There's 502ish
companies in the S&P 500. Seven out of
10 plus network effects. Seven plus out
of 10 founder le and it says 25
companies match your filters. All right.
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's a lot.
&gt;&gt; Look at this. So the top green line is
what my portfolio would have done.
&gt;&gt; Dang.
&gt;&gt; And the bottom one is the S&P. And the
S&P is crushed. It's not great. So 29%
return versus 8.4. And then there's
weighted and unweed, which is basically
like time weighted based on the
individual dates of these IPOs versus
like what the S&P has done over the last
10 years per year.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. This is a massive massive
outperformance.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Like 3x, right?
&gt;&gt; So, a I think this is rad. I've started
investing in these stocks. Robin Hood,
StubHub just went public. They're

[10:01]
StubHub just went public. They're
founder and has network effects and I'm
just going to hold them forever, right?
So, I'm using this for myself. B. back
to the original purpose of this podcast,
like anyone could take any little
investment thesis and build a little web
app around it, right? Yeah. And there's
so many ways I could charge for this.
Like you want So,
&gt;&gt; oh yeah, you totally should.
&gt;&gt; On average, a company goes public about
every day for a week. And so it's like
you want a notification when one of
these stocks goes public. You know,
you're not going to be tracking it every
day. Five bucks a month. You know, you
want to be able to back test. Oh, do you
want small cap stocks? Do you want
NASDAQ and NYC? Like
&gt;&gt; there's so many ways. And this is just
one thesis, right, of thousands of
thesis. So use Replet Lindy or whatever
Bolt, build a web app with your
investment thesis and sell access to it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I don't know if this is 10,000. I
know you didn't say this is 10,000 a
day, but I It's for sure 10,000 a year.
I would say it's for sure 10,000 a
month. Honestly, this could probably for

[11:00]
month. Honestly, this could probably for
sure be a 10,000 a week side gig.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; People pay a lot of money for good
financial data. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, it's it's just fun and it's fun to
mess with and this is not investment
advice.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's awesome.
&gt;&gt; But now that I'm talking about it, I
think I'll just I'll throw a landing
page up and make it free.
Neilstocks.com. Netocks.com.
And anyone can use it. Don't go buy
these stocks cuz I don't know, but do
your own research, but play around with
it.
&gt;&gt; I mean, don't go buy them, but you can
take a look at those graphs. You
probably should have bought them,
&gt;&gt; dude. I mean, let me just tangent just
for a second here. I like that you want
to give people free value, but anyone
who is watching this video already got
the free value because they can
screenshot this and buy. So, I say
launch it and do like a $1 free trial
and then just have it be 10 bucks a
month after that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; It auto renews 30 days later at 10 bucks
a month
&gt;&gt; or like lifetime access, you know,
&gt;&gt; or that. Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And then and then you could pay monthly
if you want recurring alerts or
whatever.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But dude, like these are the
stocks in my portfolio that fit these

[12:00]
stocks in my portfolio that fit these
criteria. Okay. And these are some of
the best performing stocks of the last
two decades. Coinbase, Tesla, Nvidia,
still founder.
&gt;&gt; Robin Hood.
&gt;&gt; I'm hitting the Jim Kramer. I'm hitting
the Jim Kramer. I think
&gt;&gt; Robin Hood's up like 4x since like
April. Yeah. Bye.
&gt;&gt; Meta, StubHub, Airbnb, those are all
founder network effect companies.
&gt;&gt; That's awesome. I did screenshot this. I
told my friend about this and he works
for Fidelity and he's like, "Hey, like
we already have a Fidelity offers a
mutual fund for this. It's called
Fidelity Founders Fund." And I looked at
it and it's like it's very much not that
like Microsoft is one of them. That's
not led by Bill Gates. Amazon, Alphabet,
most of these. They're just like, "Well,
the founder has an influence." And I'm
like, "That's not good enough for me."
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Back to you.
&gt;&gt; So, yeah. 10K a year. We talked about a
few 10K a month. I think I think
quilting could be 10K a month because Al

[13:02]
quilting could be 10K a month because Al
Don who have you had Al Don on your
podcast, haven't you?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Am I?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I just I spent a few days with
him.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. He has like, you know, this whole
quilting empire in Missouri or whatever
doing nine figures a year. Correct me if
I'm wrong. It is.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. There are quilting subreddits who
have that have, you know, like 100,000
members, but there are endless quilting
Facebook groups in different categories.
And I know this because my mom is an
obsessive quilter. She's actually
amazing at quilting. Like, she's made
all of my kids beautiful baby blankets.
And now that they're older, bigger kid
blankets, and they're awesome. And she's
always looking for new patterns. She's
always buying new new samples or
whatever. She's always looking for new
ideas. And that's just a run-of-the-mill
quilter. And we know that also the age
demo that my mom happens to be in, the
like 60 five year old woman is easy to

[14:02]
like 60 five year old woman is easy to
get to on Facebook ads. They have a lot
of discretionary income to spend. So,
vibe coding again, some sort of app that
helps them track their favorite patterns
or or it's their wish list of patterns
or it's the samples they want to get or
whatever charge 10 20 bucks a month. I
think that's a money printer.
&gt;&gt; Ooh. Or or it could just be a Chad GBT
rapper that's like a quilting chatbot
that's like, "Hey, like I can't get this
pattern quite right or what color would
go well in this corner, you know?" Yeah,
&gt;&gt; I'm totally ignorant to quilting. So,
&gt;&gt; but
&gt;&gt; yeah. No. Yeah, that would totally work
too.
&gt;&gt; Chad GBT rapper. That's that's actually
I mean you could build that into what I
was saying or just have that be a
completely separate idea cuz that would
work really well too because I think
that age demo is still a little hesitant
to use chatbt or believe Chad CBT. But
if you called this app, you know,
whatever the quilting sensei

[15:01]
whatever the quilting sensei
companion
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, that's better. or the
quilting companion and they could just
chat like you were saying and ask them
any questions about quilting at all.
Yeah, they would pay for that. My mom,
every time I'm on vacation with my mom
like at a family reunion, she lives in
Utah now, but before when she lived in
California and would visit me here in
Utah, she would all she always has a
list of quilting shops that she needs to
go to.
&gt;&gt; When I was in Europe last year, she
asked me to stop by specific quilting
shops like in Scotland. And she's like,
"Can you get me this thing from there?"
I'm like, "Mom, my bag's already like
overweight."
&gt;&gt; Trying to go to castles, Mom.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Sorry to stereotype, but they're
all like this.
&gt;&gt; Oh, man. You could have a little
directory in there. You could have a
chatbot in there. You could have
patterns in there. POD, little pattern
of the day.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's good.
&gt;&gt; Alone, if you're listening to this, my
brother, help build this. You're the guy
to do this.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, totally. A Meetup organizer. Yeah.

[16:02]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, totally. A Meetup organizer. Yeah.
Yeah. everything. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; All right. I got one for you. For 10K in
a month, I think you could run
geoargeted Facebook ads in your local
area to business owners only and host a
an in-person AI boot camp. Call it in
like a holiday in conference center. You
rent it out for $400 for an afternoon.
You get business owners to pay 75 bucks
to show up. You get a hundred of them.
Maybe that's ambitious, 7,500 bucks.
Maybe you get 50 of them, three grand,
whatever. You make decent money doing
this and you're gonna have you're gonna
have Facebook ad spend. That might take
half of your revenue, but that's aside
from your, you know, your conference
center rental or whatever it is. That's
all of your overhead. And you just like
do a PowerPoint, you do a Q&A at the
end, maybe it's two hours long, an hour
of instruction, like general like here's
how to create an AI voice agent, here's
how to create yada yada yada. Now, the
real idea here is the meet my friend at

[17:02]
real idea here is the meet my friend at
the back of the room for the high ticket
offer, right? The classic like Tony
Robbins upsell
&gt;&gt; and you sell these guys on one to $5,000
packages either monthly or one time. If
it's a $400,000 a year landscaping
business, it's probably going to be a
onetime low,000 charge. If it's a $5
million a year HVAC business, it could
be 2500 a month for 12-month contract.
And so you basically use this as an
opportunity to pay for your meta ads and
add a little cherry on top of some
profit. Hopefully you close five to 10
guys at three grand each and make really
good money for an afternoon. What do we
think?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's awesome. I mean, that could
be something that you make 10K a month
in or 10K a week in or 10K a day in
because I think you could make 10K a day
doing the 100 bucks a pop for 100 people
where you're just, you know, it's the
seven-hour seminar with lunch in the
Holiday Inn.
&gt;&gt; It's true. Yeah.

[18:00]
&gt;&gt; It's true. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But you do maybe break even because you
know that you've got those upsells
coming in at the end.
&gt;&gt; And then you have two upsells. You have
like the monthly, the 2K a month, 3K a
month type of thing where you give them,
you know, some systems or whatever that
you found or that you've built. But the
10K a day version is, hey, I'm going to
go in with you all day. I'm going to see
every I'm just going to be your shadow
the whole day. I'm going to see how you
do your email, how you talk to your, if
it's a contractor, how you talk to your
subs. I'm going to see how you bid your
leads. I'm going to see every single
thing you do. I'm going to see how you
talk to your secretary. And then the
next day, you make it sound longer. Then
I'm going to take the next month and I'm
going to build out all the systems to
automate all that. 10 grand onetime fee.
It actually only takes you a day because
you already have it prepped. And here
you go. I bet a lot of people would do
that, too.
&gt;&gt; 100%. And I think it's important you
name it something like Minneapolis AI

[19:01]
name it something like Minneapolis AI
experts, right? Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Like local city AI expert.
&gt;&gt; Expert or experts. All right. All right,
I want to pause here just for a second
to tell you why I've used Beehive for 2
years. And I just actually sent my 100th
newsletter edition. I love Beehive. And
you see, email's different from other
platforms because social media platforms
own your audience. In fact, YouTube just
banned me for a week because they didn't
like one of my videos even though it was
perfectly compliant. If Instagram
changes their algorithm, your reach
tanks. Same with Tik Tok, Facebook, and
anything else. You're building on rented
land. But with Beehive, I own my list. I
own my audience. I'm not at the mercy of
some nameless, faceless algorithm. Every
time I hit send, they just get my
emails. And Beehive makes this simple.
Growth tools, monetization, and a free
website. And I can't get enough of their
analytics and the data I get from
Beehive. This is data that I can
actually use and share with potential
sponsors. It's everything you need in
one platform. The smartest creators out
there are the ones that own their own

[20:01]
there are the ones that own their own
audience. So go to beehive.com/chris
to get 30% off your first three months.
That's beehiv.com/chris
and start building something you
actually own. I think the local aspect
is very important. They don't want to
think you're some traveling salesman
rolling in and rolling out of town with
everyone's money. Like you're local and
if you want to scale this like
&gt;&gt; whatever there's there's still going to
be 100,000 business owners in
Minneapolis, right? Yeah. Like just
&gt;&gt; an easy number for me to remember is 10%
of basically every human in America is a
business owner, right? There's 33
million business owners. 33 330 million
people, right? So Minneapolis has a
million people. You got 100,000 business
owners. Now granted, most of them cannot
afford this, right? Most of them. But
that's okay. 20,000 of them probably
can. Can you get 50 of those 20,000 to
show up with your Facebook ads?
Especially if they see the same Facebook
ad 10 times over the course of a week,
you know.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And then they're going to bring a

[21:00]
&gt;&gt; And then they're going to bring a
friend.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And build that in. Have a refer a
friend thing to get discount or
whatever. But they're all having
conversations now. And these
conversations are only going to
accelerate. The topic being how do I
implement AI in my company? I don't
know. I don't know how to do it. I don't
know where to go. Right? And then they
Google something and then they see who
knows what they see all different. They
see like ads from IBM talking about AI
in it. Like IBM's not actually wanting
their business, but IBM is just
spending, right? Because they're
spending all things related to AI. So
yeah, and anyone I know lots of people
are enjoying going down the local
newsletter
rabbit hole. I have a local newsletter
that I don't spend much effort on at
all, but I recently I only do like two
sends a month with this thing. I need to
do more with Beehive. Use Chris's
affiliate link below, please. Thank you,
Brandon.
&gt;&gt; But, uh, I started putting after our
last call that we had to re-record, I
started putting a Google form in the
newsletter

[22:01]
newsletter
pitch saying that I'm going to do an AI
seminar for small business owners and to
indicate interest and then with some
questions about like topic ideas and
length of time. And I have like 27
responses so far saying that they're in
for the $100 on a Saturday. So,
&gt;&gt; whoa.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Whoa. Okay. So,
&gt;&gt; big time.
&gt;&gt; Plot twist. Chris brings up a random
idea and you tell me you're doing it.
&gt;&gt; That was not an audience plant here.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. That's true, actually. Yeah.
So, I just thought, "Oh, I'll just do
that. I'll just have that link in my
newsletter until I get to a hundred and
then yeah that'll be the trigger where I
actually send where I book something and
you know maybe I don't get a hundred who
actually follow through but they all
know that I'm going to do it for $100
and it's going to be on a Saturday and
here's the topics you know maybe half
convert but then I'm now I'm going to go
down your rabbit hole of okay now I I'll
use chat GPT to help me plan the seminar

[23:02]
use chat GPT to help me plan the seminar
then I'll do the seminar I'll use chat
GPT to help me think of the upsells for
different sizes of companies and what's
the monthly and what's the one day, you
know, whatever. And you know, you're
using AI to do stuff with AI and it
works,
&gt;&gt; dude. Amazing. We got to do 10K in a
week now, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. 10K ideas in a week. You had a
good one last time recorded. You should
do this one again. Shipping container
storage rental.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, just for those listening, you
have not heard this already. I recorded
it. we never published it. The 8020 of
it is you go on Facebook Marketplace,
you find someone selling a 20 or 40 foot
shipping container, you buy them for $2
to $5,000 each, and you rent them out as
storage as an alternative to a 10 x10
storage unit. They're much much bigger.
Just crunch the numbers on that. Like a
10x10 storage unit in any market is
going to go between 85 and $185.
So that's 100 square feet. Whereas a 40

[24:00]
So that's 100 square feet. Whereas a 40
foot shipping container that you pay
$4,000 for is eight by 320 square feet.
I think I have that right. 8 by40 and 8
feet tall. So it's three times as big.
And if you charge 150 bucks a month for
it, call it the same price. You make
that money back in two years, two and a
half years. or you split it up into
fourths and you rent it out for 75 bucks
a month and you're effectively making
$300 a month and making your money back
in a year. It's portable storage. And
I've got a buddy on Twitter who does
this. He will find a plot of land that's
on a busy road and he will do a lease
purchase agreement where he says, "All
right, Mr. Owner of this land. I want to
put a storage facility here. They won't
be permanent. They're going to be
portable. I don't know if it will work.
So, I'll pay you $2,000 a month for the
next 12 months. If my business goes
well, let's agree that you'll sell it to
me today for $400,000. If it does not go
well, we're just going to, you know,

[25:00]
well, we're just going to, you know,
shake hands and go separate ways. And as
far as I know, he's never had a deal not
go well. It's just a way of him proving
out the model and starting a business
and de-risking and getting investors on
board and banks on board. He has a whole
year to do that before he ends up having
to buy the land. So that's kind of like
two ideas in one. But
&gt;&gt; yeah,
&gt;&gt; what did I miss?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's awesome. Well, I feel like
cuz I've actually looked at storage
containers. You can always get them for
remarkably cheap, these big old things.
So yeah, I think I think that's a really
good idea.
&gt;&gt; Well, and how do you make 10K in a week?
A, you can charge a year up front for a
discount. B, you can resell them. C, I
don't know. How can you? How else can
you? Um,
&gt;&gt; I think
&gt;&gt; I don't know how else. But
&gt;&gt; why is this in the in a week category?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Maybe it's in a month.
&gt;&gt; Oh, or you can you just buy multiples,
right? You buy multiples.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. That's why. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And then you sell a week.

[26:00]
&gt;&gt; And then you sell a week.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I really like that. Okay.
Here's another one. As a week in a week,
a garage sale as a service service. So,
garage sales are big. There are lots of
people though who could make lots of
money with garage sales but don't want
to do it. Maybe they don't want to do it
at their house or maybe they just don't
have the time because maybe they're
upper middle class or higher. So the
idea and this does exist but it's
actually quite rare. Like there's a
place in SoCal that we found. There's
not that many places though. Go to the
specific larger neighborhoods in your
general metro area that are higher
income. pitch your service. You take you
charge a fee and then you get a cut of
all the proceeds and go to the go to the
luxury, you know, more luxury
neighborhoods and then all they have to
do is the only thing they have to do is
just put everything
&gt;&gt; whatever on their driveway that they
want you to sell. Your job then is

[27:01]
want you to sell. Your job then is
you're going to take it, you're going to
put it wherever the garage sale is going
to be. You're going to price it. You're
going to obviously try to maximize the
value because you're getting paid on
commission basically.
And I think you could for sure make 10K
in a week because I guarantee you in
where I live in Utah, there's a city
named Alpine. There's a lot of people
who have a lot of money who live in
Alpine. These are not the type of people
that are like thinking, "Oh man, what
should I when should my next garage sale
be?" But I guarantee you, they have lots
of stuff that's worth a lot that they
can't fit anymore because they keep
buying more stuff.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And you know what they're going to
do if they never have a garage sale?
They're going to rent a dumpster for
$500 and throw it all away.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So that's your that's your BATNA.
Your best alternative to a negotiated
agreement is them just throwing it all
away and making losing $500, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And you could tell
them that you could take you could do it
offsite if they don't want to be, you
know, exposed for selling their old
stuff from a um ego standpoint or or
image standpoint, right? Or you could do

[28:01]
image standpoint, right? Or you could do
it at their and that would be an extra
fee, you having to do it somewhere else
versus their own driveway. But you you
handle all the advertising. And
simultaneously though, especially if
you're obviously geoargeted, if you're
just in like if you're in specific
county or two, then you, this person
should be building an email list and a
text list that you blast out the next
time you're doing a luxury garage sale.
So you can come to these homes, these
homeowners, and say, "Hey, I already
have a list of 3,000 people that love
buying from luxury garage sales. So, I
promise you like the worst one I've done
made 40 grand.
&gt;&gt; Oh jeez, dude. It It's like uh in TK
owners, our community, right? We had an
AMA yesterday and a guy buys pressure
washers and you know,
&gt;&gt; furniture, you know, outdoor furniture.
And he said, "Chris, how can I decrease
my reliance on Facebook Marketplace?"
And I said, "Build an email list." Like,
run Facebook ads to your local area in

[29:00]
run Facebook ads to your local area in
Sacramento. Build an email list and send
out daily deals. And then people just
love a good deal. Like they don't need a
black stone.
&gt;&gt; They need a black stone for $100 off,
you know?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And then they can feel special like
they're in on a secret. So what you're
suggesting is basically a version of
that, but for garage sales, right? You
build your own list and own your own
audience.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Dude, that gives me a secondary idea
that we didn't talk about last time
based on a conversation I had with a
friend a week ago.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So this guy, his whole business,
you're going to love this. He doesn't
really have a family. He travels a lot.
He's kind of a vagabond. His whole
business is traveling around the
country, going to estate sales once
they're basically done and buying all
the leftover crap for pennies on the
dollar. Okay.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; That's he doesn't care about estate
sales when they launch. Like let's say
an estate sale is is Friday to Sunday.
He goes Sunday night. He's like, "Oh,
what you got? We got this furniture. You
know, this couch that was six grand at
retail that we tried to sell for 500

[30:01]
retail that we tried to sell for 500
bucks. We've got this, you know, it was
three grand for retail. We tried to send
for sell for 200 bucks. And that's the
thing with selling any of this stuff. I
don't care how good of a deal it is. A
lot of times people just don't want it,
right? Especially if the estate sale did
not market well and there wasn't a big
enough audience. So he comes in and back
to a BATNA, best alternative to a
negotiated agreement, the heirs of the
person that likely just died. What they
have to do now is go rent a $500 rolloff
dumpster, maybe three of them, and throw
all this crap away because the house is
sold. They got to get it out.
&gt;&gt; And they're probably in a bad mood
already or not.
&gt;&gt; They're in a bad mood and they don't
want to throw this stuff away, right?
They don't want to, you know, throw away
grandma's old china cabinet that was
from World War II. And so he comes in
and let's just say I'm making this up.
The price the individual price tags of
all this stuff which is already heavily
discounted is $5,000 left, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; He comes in and says, "I'll give you 500
bucks for it. I'll have it gone by the

[31:00]
bucks for it. I'll have it gone by the
morning." And they're like, "Done. That
means I don't have to spend 500 bucks to
throw it away."
&gt;&gt; And then he goes and and resells it.
That's all he does, dude. He's like
&gt;&gt; he's buying
&gt;&gt; They say in business, you know, sell
your sawdust, right? All the leftover
stuff. This guy's buying sawdust and
then selling it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's awesome. That's amazing.
Okay. Well, I have an idea for 10K in a
day and then you got to you got to drop
the mic with your last 10K in a day one.
Quick question. What if there were a
private community out there of people
that were building businesses based on
this podcast? Well, I just made it and
it's only for business starters and
business builders. It's called TK owners
and it's basically like having me and
100 other business geniuses as your
business partner. Also, there's going to
be exclusive new trends, growth hacks,
business ideas, and a database of
everything I've ever talked about.
You'll find thousands of startup case
studies. You'll have weekly ask me
anythings with me while I'll answer your
questions directly. You can join now at
tkowners.com. Link in the show notes.
Okay, so here's mine. It's a popup

[32:01]
Okay, so here's mine. It's a popup
headshot
booth. You do you do this at
&gt;&gt; either at business events or at like a
office. And what your offer is is you
you have all the camera, you know, the
nice camera setup, all that kind of
stuff. People can come in and just
schedule, you know, 10 15 minute slots
and get whatever they need done, but
it's only 10 to 15 minutes. So, you can
still charge high because you're going
to provide a lot of value and give them
the fully edited versions. But if they
need head shot, if they have an
e-commerce brand and they need product
shots, if they need some quick UGC
videos, if they need a good studio,
you're just a studio but for a day and
you have everything ready and you give
them everything they need. And I think
you could you could do this at different
studios around the city or or state or
whatever and or go to conferences and
have a nice setup that are business
conferences and say, "Hey, you need to
update your headsh shot or you
&gt;&gt; all day."

[33:00]
&gt;&gt; all day."
&gt;&gt; All day.
&gt;&gt; I think you can make good money.
&gt;&gt; This reminds me, you just asked me about
Main Street, a conference in Missouri.
When Nick and I went to Main Street last
year, one of the, you know, the tickets
were like $1,500, but one of the
features that were included were free
head shot. And so Main Street was paying
them. And then I get in line to get my
head shot. You got like make a 10-minute
appointment. And it was sponsored by
Open Phone, right? Which is like, you
know, it's a it's a great company.
They're Silicon Valley funded. And I'm
in line just talking and one of the Open
Phone representatives is like just
talking to me. She's super nice. And
then later I look her up and it was the
founder and of like this big company and
she was at Main Street. And so, not only
that, like I think I'm making an
assumption here, Open Phone paid the
conference to pay photographer, a local
photographer to take free head shot. And
that headsh shot is my picture
everywhere, like on all my socials. I
got it for free, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And so, this is like a modern-day
corporate version of the J C Penney like
glamour shots, right? And so let's say I

[34:02]
glamour shots, right? And so let's say I
worked in a high-rise in downtown
Dallas, you know, 67 stories, 67, and uh
I I walk in from Chipotle through the
lobby to the elevators and I see like a
big hab over to the right, someone
taking head shots like, "God dang it, my
LinkedIn headshot is four years old.
This will probably take three minutes.
There's a QR code to the girl's Venmo
for 25 bucks. I'm going to do that all
day." Right.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I love it. Okay, drop the
hammer. All right. So, when we had this
uh call two months ago, I talked about,
you know, taking all these
subcontractors I'd found for building my
own sport court and built you like
starting my own sport construction
business. I've told the story a couple
times, so I'll just go real quickly. We
built a sport court in our backyard. I
got quotes. The quotes were between $50
and $60,000. That's not worth it to me.
That's too much money, and I'm cheap.
And we're talking about four things
here. We're talking about cement pad,
surfacing, a fence, basketball hoop, and

[35:02]
surfacing, a fence, basketball hoop, and
electrical. So, that's actually five
things. Five subcontractors, right? And
so, I just started reaching out on
Facebook Marketplace, friends and
family. I have like three friends that
have just got sport courts put in. Long
story short, it's almost done. I'm
getting electrical done today. I'm
getting the surfacing done next week.
The fence is in, the hoop is in. It
looks amazing. I'm paying like $29,000
for it for everything.
&gt;&gt; Nice. And on one hand it's like, "Yeah,
but what about the value of your time,
Chris?" Listen, I swipe Instagram for an
hour a day, two hours a day.
&gt;&gt; I do hate that comment.
&gt;&gt; I watch Love is Blind with my wife every
hour.
&gt;&gt; Do I value my time highly? Yeah. But
like that logic only works if every
second of your day is fully optimized to
the health, right?
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; So, if I hire a guy to do it, I'm still
going to have to go out there and tell
his subs to move that thing over there
that he did that wrong. I still have
headaches. It's just headaches plus
21,000 extra dollars.
&gt;&gt; So it's like why not keep the headaches
and keep the money.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So anyway, so James, my friend partner

[36:03]
&gt;&gt; So anyway, so James, my friend partner
at fasttreecare. So I go to James and
I'm like what do you think? I love it.
So we buy the domain name backyardf
funhouse.com he uses Verscell to build a
beautiful website. Like it does not look
like a vibecoded website.
&gt;&gt; Put a website on it. I take six videos,
selfie videos, no script, in my backyard
saying like, "Look at this freaking
sport court. It's still under
construction, but do you want your kids
to be on screens all day or do you want
them to be playing on a sport court?
They're on screens because they don't
have anything better to do outside. Give
them something better to do." I kind of
took that angle and I posted six videos
to Facebook ads, $100 a day budget per
video, each ad in its own ad set. And I
will share my screen and show the proof.
And here are the results. So far, I
started around October 1st. I turned off
one of the five ads because it was not
performing. I was spending $150 per
lead, but you can see after 7 days of
data, I'm spending between $23 and $36

[37:01]
data, I'm spending between $23 and $36
per lead.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's amazing. You're doing the
the form fill out within Meta. Is that
what's happening?
&gt;&gt; Instant form within Meta.
&gt;&gt; Then they can click through to my
website once I get their data, but I'm
just asking for their name and phone
number. So, in the spirit of
transparency and being tactical, this is
what my ad looks like. It's not fancy.
It's just me talking. I edit it myself
in Cap Cut. I just have captions. It
took me five minutes to edit each one.
Pools are lame. I use
&gt;&gt; pools are lame. I love I love that hook.
&gt;&gt; It's like basically pools are old news
now. Sport courts. That was just one.
And I'm jumping on a trampoline because
we also sell ingground trampolines. And
um I use chat GPT to generate my
headlines, my primary text, my
description. I don't even know the
difference between all of them to be
honest. I learned it and then I forgot
it. And then I just have this instant
form that just asks for for their name
and number. And then if you go over
here, my leads are pushing through to a

[38:00]
here, my leads are pushing through to a
Google sheet through Zapier. And these
this is the name. This is the phone
number. This is when it came in. This is
the name of the ad. Because maybe you
spend $100 to get a lead, but they're 10
times more likely to close. Maybe a
different ad only cost you $10 to get a
lead. So you're like, "Oh, let's go all
in on this." But those people are less
likely to close. So
&gt;&gt; I want to know which ads are are
converting and to leads and which leads
are converting to closes.
&gt;&gt; So as you can see to those watching, and
I do recommend you pull up the video of
this, 80% of these ghost us. And that's
the game. You know, when I knocked on
doors in Hungary,
&gt;&gt; 99% of everyone ghosted me. And that's
the game. But that's okay because we've
already given out like four quotes. This
is how James is scoring him from 1 to
10. And then this is this isn't updated
right now. That's just a placeholder.
But long story short, like this $2,500
in ad spend thus far will probably bring
us between 25 and $45,000 of net profit.

[39:04]
us between 25 and $45,000 of net profit.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And we're subbing everything out.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, this was an idea that we
talked about
&gt;&gt; on the podcast and it's like it's not
like we only talk about ideas that like
we don't really like that much. Like, we
talk about all of them and some of them
we like so much that we start and we're
totally cool with people copying us
because law of abundance and all that.
And also, if you're in DFW, check out
backyardfundance.com. We'd love to take
care of you.
&gt;&gt; I'm going to start this for for Utah.
I'm going to I'll do a slightly
different approach. I love the way you
did your video ad, though. I'll do the
meta lead thing still. I don't have a
James though. I guess I could try to
find a James because I was thinking
maybe I do it without a James. And I
just say I'll show what I've done and
I'll say, "Hey, I vetted five
contractors for each of all these things
I did. My sport court, my pool, my
putting green,
&gt;&gt; etc.
&gt;&gt; I already vetted five for each. I'll

[40:00]
&gt;&gt; I already vetted five for each. I'll
just give you the info of the best one
who's still affordable for each one.
Just pay me a flat fee of a thousand
bucks and then I'll separately try to
get those subs to pay me a cut for each
job that they actually get hired on. So
maybe I'll take that approach. But I do
want to do this because I I love the
idea, which was yours, by the way.
&gt;&gt; I can't wait to hear how that goes. It's
going to be awesome. And if anyone wants
to see those ads, like just go to the
meta ads library, type in the Kerner
office and they're live today as of
today. They might not be live forever,
but please go look, go copy me. Also, if
anyone wants to buy my treeming
business, fasttreecare.com, I'm selling
it because James is doing this now and
it's going to be cheap and it's a good
business and all the goodwill and assets
are there and uh you'll get support
directly from me and James. So, if you
want to buy Faster Streetare, email
chris@cofounders.com and let's talk.
&gt;&gt; Also, if you want to join a community
with hundreds of active entrepreneurs,
