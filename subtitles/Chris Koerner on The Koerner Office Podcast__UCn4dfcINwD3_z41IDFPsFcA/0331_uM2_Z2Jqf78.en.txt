first episode of the margin is right I'm
going to ask this fine gentleman a bunch
of questions about his business and try
to guess what his profit margin
percentage is if I'm within 5% he's
going to give me free jerky if I'm not
I'm going to buy jerky from him sounds
like a plan name's Tim usri with tchi
jerky mom got me a dehydrator for
Christmas a couple years ago I started
making jerky for friends what type of
cut do you use I use eye of round you
buying your ingredients wholesale or
from the grocery store I buy them from a
restaurant supply store do you have any
employees nope I'm going to have to
guess on like a price per pound
wholesale eight bucks a pound actually
don't answer because this is going into
my math don't answer no cheating but
then you got to dehydrate it you're
going to take like 80 70% of the weight
out 4 o
$15 probably going to be 16 to 20 ounces
call it a pound I'm going to say your
gross profit margin not including your
time packaging meat seasoning I'm going
to say
