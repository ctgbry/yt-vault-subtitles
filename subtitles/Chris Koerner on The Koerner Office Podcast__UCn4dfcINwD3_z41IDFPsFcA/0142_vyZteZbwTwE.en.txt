okay I promise you'll never believe how
much this bad boy makes every week so I
rented this skid steer here to clear
some land here where I live in Texas and
I had to Pepper the guy with questions
when I rented it how do you find
customers how much did that bad boy cost
how much do you charge and nobody he
charged me charged me 400 bucks for half
a day and it was worth every penny he
gets all of his customers from Facebook
Marketplace guys don't overthink it free
organic Facebook Marketplace post he
rents this thing out six to 10 times a
day and he has four of them that is a
six fig your profit business from buying
a $10,000 skid steer that's really
really fun to drive I will add anyway
don't overthink business okay buy a skid
steer put it on Facebook Marketplace see
how it goes buy it at a discount if it
doesn't work out sell it for a profit or
break even
