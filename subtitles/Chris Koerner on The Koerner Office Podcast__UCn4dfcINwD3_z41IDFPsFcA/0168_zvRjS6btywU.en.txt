Okay, so I own a tree trimming business
and I saw this post, so I wanted to
comment on it. First of all, right idea,
wrong execution. These machines cost
$50,000, not 2,800. Second of all, you
got to buy a $10,000 trailer and drive
all over the place. So, it's much more
than 10 minutes. But if you go directly
through the landscapers and the tree
trimmers and not to consumers, this is a
really, really good business. Especially
because you can rent an expensive
machine for the first month to hedge
your risk just in case it doesn't work
