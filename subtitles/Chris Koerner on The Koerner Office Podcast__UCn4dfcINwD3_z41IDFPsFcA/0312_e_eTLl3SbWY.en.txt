[00:00]
welcome to the ker office if you hear
any background noise on this intro today
it's because I'm recording from the
Kansas City Airport because the show
must go on today is another episode of
hold Co Bros with me and my business
partner Nick heski and we talked about
several pretty interesting things we
talked about the treasure hunt business
we talked about electronic recycling and
the electronic fundraiser business which
isn't really an industry but it's a
business that I've done in the past that
I loved and worked really well and I
think one of you guys should copy then
we talked about a couple kind of hacky
kitchy Chrome extension is type ideas
that I think you'll love so please like
And subscribe share with a friend and
we'll see you next
[Music]
time all right we doing this Nick let's
freaking do this dude okay so our good
friend will sent me an idea not an idea
this is a business that's pretty
interesting and I think people could
copy it in different ways okay you ready
you ready Born Ready dude okay I never
heard of this until yesterday it's
called project Sky Drop okay okay what
is Project Sky Drop I'm going to read
this from the website project Sky Drop

[01:00]
this from the website project Sky Drop
is a real world treasure hunt a precious
object made of 10 troy ounces of 24K
pure gold has been placed somewhere in a
circle that starts out 500 miles in
diameter over the course of three weeks
that Circle shrinks day by day at the
end of The Hunt The Circle will shrink
down to a single foot pinpointing the
exact treasure location people who join
the hunt receive daily clues in the form
of aerial photographs of the treasure
taken from higher and higher altitudes
half of each each entry fee contributes
to an additional cash Bounty that grows
over time as more people join the first
person to locate the treasure and take
it wins the hunt and claims the cash
Bounty how genius is this dude that's a
freaking that's amazing how much is the
entry price I don't even know I'm
looking right now and is it an All or
Nothing is it like oh second place gets
this third place gets this or is it like
look you're first or you're last like
Ricky Bobby's dad would say listen Ricky
if you ain't first you're
last well that don't make no sense

[02:00]
last well that don't make no sense
there's second there's third heck
there's even fourth okay so it's
$27,000 worth of gold which is about
it's 10
o join now it is $20 so if you join for
$20 you receive an exclusive members
only clue each day by email and text
message each clue is I love this I can't
even read I'm just so excited right now
we need to get these guys to pay us each
clue is an aerial photograph of the
treasure location taken from higher and
higher altitudes Clues are sent between
9 and three each day and first joined
first sent order by joining today you
will get your Clues earlier in the day
than someone who joins tomorrow gain
instant access to Clues from previous
days is there a pricing tier is it just
$20 or is it like for 50 you can get
early it's just 20 looks like it's just
20 bucks dude that's amazing and the
website smart is so simple there's
nothing really to click on it has a
proof of appraisal showing that it's
real gold it has uh pictures of where it
is and then it has a a USA member ZIP

[03:00]
is and then it has a a USA member ZIP
code map and you can see that most of
the members are happen to live in an
area that's close to this the pricing is
so smart cuz it's like why would I not
pay 20 bucks like it's a YOLO type of
purchase right like oh yeah $27,000 just
for the gold yeah I'll spend 20 bucks
have you ever seen those videos on
YouTube of the guy who's where they're
like find out where I am and it's like a
woman and she's she might be sitting at
a table and there's like almost no other
Clues and he just reverse Engineers it
and he's like okay well looks like
there's a t if I like the contrast yep
there it is right there it's this
restaurant and if I go to Google and he
like finds it within five minutes this
is that this is like that on steroids
yeah that guy would crush it at this
they need to ban him for life from this
what you're saying is like first days
pictures is like an inch from the gold
second day is a foot third day is 10
feet like those might not be the right
distances but that's how it works like
each additional day you get a higher and
higher level view of where this gold is

[04:01]
higher level view of where this gold is
yeah I I believe that's right I'm
looking at
923 yeah it just keeps zooming
out when did it
start I think just a couple days
ago D that is freaking smart so there's
another company doing this Utah treasure
hunts.com they do this a couple times a
year so one of the podcast listeners
named Parker shout out to Parker sent
this to me and he said a couple of
Realtors have been doing it for a couple
years now now they get some exposure for
their companies and whatnot but it's
more of a passion project long story
short they hide a treasure chest
somewhere in Utah and then release a
cryptic poem with clues that lead to it
they supposedly don't make any money
from doing this the only return I can
see them making is growing their email
list and social media voling they do get
some sponsors to help with a cash prize
but their costs are increasing with
their growing email list and server
needs yada y y can we talk about any
time I hear someone's like we don't even
make any money from this we've talked
about this just like okay we talked
about this on this pod yeah either like

[05:00]
about this on this pod yeah either like
they're dumb and they don't know how to
monetize or they're lying I refuse to
believe
otherwise they're lying most of the time
they're lying and and they're like doing
all this mental gymnastics where they're
like well technically like the treasure
box costs us $1,000 and to pay to find
it we get a 100,000 but each of us spent
a Year's worth of our time planning this
on an hourly Bas Cal and so like
actually actually it cost just 160,000
we lost money on it mhm I freaking hate
that that's so stupid it reminds me of
the Calico cut pants skit from I think
you should leave he's like you got to
donate because he's totally underwater
he's only eating hamburgers to survive
right now like like keeping a website
active is so expensive gosh so how could
people copy this I think it's fairly
simple if you have something of
intrinsic value right not like oh I have
a marketing agency and I'll do a month
free for you like no I have this gold

[06:01]
free for you like no I have this gold
bar or I have this 67 chel chevel that I
want that's in mint condition anything
that you have that's in that1 to $30,000
price range and then you you put the
dollar amount the entry fee at that 20
bucks I think you could do this with
I've assigned baseball from so and so I
have a like I'm trying to even think
what else you could auction off but you
could even say like one Bitcoin right
like you could have the cold storage
like right you print it off and then you
hide it somewhere and somebody has to
actually go and find it and literally
the first person who finds it gets that
Bitcoin because it's a piece of paper
that they can then scan to their wallet
but I think you could do it with a lot
of things the hard part is a getting the
momentum because it's such a high
price like to win and it's such a low
barrier of Entry the 20 bucks I would
assume it catches Wildfire pretty
quickly but you probably want some type
of an audience in order to get a
launched and the second thing is you
can't do a bad job of hiding it like
yeah I have a friend in high school who

[07:01]
yeah I have a friend in high school who
there was this radio contest and they
were I can't remember what it was but
they like hid something and they would
give Clues every day on the radio of
where it was hidden and it was supposed
to be like this
30-day event and in day two my friend
who's super smart Jimmy Riley shout out
I don't know if he's listening he found
out where it
was and he wrote Into the the radio
station he's like yeah yeah it's in this
Water Tower in Chicago or something like
that and so they like had to stop the
you know the competition because you
found it in day two but like totally
ruined what they were trying to do which
was like create Buzz around the radio
station get more people to listen right
like so I would think if you are
somebody who has a business and you want
to have a guerilla
marketing event or tactic then I would
find something that is of value like we
could do this with our businesses we
basically say we're going to put $30,000
to marketing this year and so this is
what it will be and then the treasure
hunt is essentially MH the marketing the

[08:00]
hunt is essentially MH the marketing the
buzz around the the treasure hunt comes
back to us I think that people could
partner with local influencers to do
this in any local market and it doesn't
need to be 26 Grand it could be five
grand in DFW right you partner with a
couple Instagram accounts that focus on
DFW restaurants or travel or airbnbs you
partner with them and you could do it
every quarter or every month this is
really interesting you could go and find
like 10 local businesses or
more and say hey we're doing this
marketing thing here's the cost and they
have to throw in something free maybe a
restaurant is like free pizza for a year
and it's like one pizza every single
week for your family for a year and then
the nail salon says like whatever free
nails for a year whatever and they like
you combine all of those contributions
from these businesses and say this
treasure chest is worth
$30,000 right and then because you're in
this local market you hide it and then
like the local market gets into it I'm
sure you could leverage some face
Facebook group Twitter Instagram local

[09:02]
Facebook group Twitter Instagram local
local influencers like you're saying but
then it could be small businesses
participating in this they get free
publicity you would charge something to
them obviously and it would just like
that would just be so much fun could you
imagine having this there be like a
treasure hunt with your kids remember
dude remember 10 years ago I can't
remember when it was I came out to
Dallas as when Pokemon go was really
popular and we drove to some outlet mall
I don't even know what it was I this was
you must be
I've never played Pokemon go you Carson
like we get to that mall and like you
look over and you see somebody with
their kid and they're like on their
phone and I'm like what the freak are
they doing he's like oh my gosh they
found a Pokemon Carson Carson what
what's here I was like I think it's a
it's the r It's the rler dad is that a
Bulbasaur is that a Bulbasaur right it
was like but it created this cool
environment where the dad and the son
could actually go and do something
together like a family could actually go
and do this treasure hunt that would be
a really cool component to it is make it
family friendly I like the idea of

[10:01]
family friendly I like the idea of
partnering with businesses because it's
the same value but without having to
spend $30,000 it's like a negative CAC
customer acquisition cost you go to like
10 different restaurants maybe like a
Velvet Taco like a regional chain not
like a Chili's but like something that's
native to DFW that has a budget for
something like this you find five of
them you get them to pay a few grand for
this attention in promotion and then
free tacos for a year and so like the
literal value of this is 10 20 $30,000
but you got paid 10 20 $30,000 to do it
and then you partner with the
influencers and then they promote it and
instead of having to buy a $30,000 gold
bar and hoping that people buy $30,000
worth of tickets to offset it like a
lottery you're profitable on day one do
you know what I would do if I if my kids
team was like we're gonna do a
fundraiser and they all like do the same
fundraisers right like we're selling
cookies or they sell those little
booklets or whatever it is this would be
a really cool test of a fundraiser
wouldn't that be freaking cool it would

[11:01]
wouldn't that be freaking cool it would
be unite the community in a way yeah
girley posted about this recently where
he's like I have a friend of mine who
makes over a million dollars a year
making pancakes for nonprofits and he
works like 80 days a year and basically
his business model is anytime that these
nonprofits have like a pancake breakfast
or like something for the community they
hire his friend's company his friend has
like 50% margins and he goes and just
makes pancakes right that's his business
you could do this in your local
community like you could be like hey
Church hey High School hey soccer club
Hey Girl Scouts whatever it is you could
do multiple this is the thing that I do
is I coordinate these treasure hunts and
I get local businesses to contribute and
this is the way we create the buzz on
average this is how much money we raise
and this is my fee Etc but like that
could be a business locally is creating
these sort of fundraising
nonprofits with the treasure hunt
component to it I love it and while
we're talking about about school school

[12:00]
we're talking about about school school
fundraisers let me go off script for a
minute because I did one of these and
some business ideas that just like I
execute and it works and then I move on
and then years later no one else is
doing it and it's like why isn't anyone
doing this this works so school
fundraisers I used to coach wrestling at
Bob Jones High School shout out Madison
Alabama and we have
fund no that's not what I said we have a
fundraiser every year and we would sell
cheesecakes we'd Buy for like $15 and
then the wrestlers would go door too in
the neighborhoods and sell them for like
$45 $50 okay and it it's a good business
like in order to have any fundraiser you
have to have a lot of margin because
there's so many middlemen involved
right and so the year after we did this
I was like hey guys how about we do a
different fundraiser I own a company
called phone restore we recycle iPhones
Let's do an electon Electronics Drive
remember I'll bring in a box I'll brand
it I'll leave it in the wrestling room
you send out an email to the parents
and they bring in old electronics and

[13:01]
and they bring in old electronics and
just put them in the box and then I will
list them on eBay sell them and give you
guys a cut of the money and so it's like
it's a perfect business because people
just donate for free stuff that they
already have and maybe it's a keyboard
that really has no value maybe it's an
iPhone worth $150 well that's worth like
six cheesecakes and no one has to spend
any money except some Rando on eBay on
the other side of the country everybody
does the same fundraisers it's the same
thing every time oh yeah we'll have the
parents bake some cookies and then we'll
sell them off or they're going to raise
the money because people are like they
want to support that kid right or that
cost not because oh I really want this
food or that product but if you could
pair a very appealing product or
offering with these fundraisers like you
did with Bob Vance refrigerations High
School
wrestling that's a win for everybody
right like it's not just oh give little
Timmy 20 bucks because he's raising
money I could actually use getting rid
of a lot of these old electronics yeah

[14:01]
of a lot of these old electronics yeah
we also did a point system a lot of like
the fundraisers have like a a
competition where it's like yeah all
right kids whoever raises the most money
gets free Olive
Garden but so I had a point system where
it was like however many dollars your
device is worth that's like a point to
you so that incentivized people to not
just bring in an old keyboard or
something that they knew was worthless
they would want to bring in a Nintendo
switch or an iPhone I don't even
remember what the prize was but what's
great about this is you don't have to do
it with one school you could do it like
with every sports team at a high school
any organization in your community that
ever does fundraisers like off the top
of my head Girl Scouts Boy Scouts high
schools churches elementary schools yep
and there's probably dozens more than
I'm not even thinking of yeah that are
always looking for cool ways to
differentiate themselves and get and
raise more money this is a public call
out so oh I want to hear someone do this
and what's great about this business is

[15:00]
and what's great about this business is
a lot of the people listening have kids
and even if the kids in preschool could
have a fundraiser there High School it
doesn't matter if this idea excites you
I want you to go out and do it and
approach your elementary school or your
middle school your high school at
whatever it is your church and just pose
this idea and see if you can gather some
Electronics sell them on eBay or
Facebook Marketplace and report back and
we'll have you on and talk to you about
how it went because this is a business
that anyone could do like what you just
said is key there's a no downside to
this test
the downside is you're left with a bunch
of electronics that you don't know what
to do with because you couldn't sell
them on eBay right but you didn't come
out of pocket and buy all of this
stuff that's right I like it yeah all
right if you are watching this clip
right now you are watching this on
YouTube and if you are a fan of podcast
please check out my podcast while you're
at it because sometimes I have podcasts
that aren't on YouTube and sometimes I
have YouTubes that aren't on podcast so
check out the ker office on any podcast
platform or you can go to TKO pod.com
also my newsletter will throw that in
there no ads It's weekly it's different

[16:00]
there no ads It's weekly it's different
content than my podcast and YouTube
newsletter. chrisj ker.com You'll see
the link and we'll see you there you
know why the treasure hunt idea works
like this treasure hunt idea will always
work because I can't speak for women but
it is ingrained in the male DNA to want
to treasure hunt period end of story I
don't care who you are that will never
go away yeah we hunt and they gather
right edit that out Muhammad me man you
woman all right should we give the
people what they want a perfuma update
let's do it why don't you go go ahead
quick summary for those who don't know
the long and short of it is Chris posted
a real to Instagram and YouTube two
months ago at this point two and a half
months ago at this point we got a bunch
of inbound and the real was of a perfume
vending machine people found it very
interesting and so because we had so
many leads that came in it was like 2500
leads we decided let's talk to the
manufacturer negotiate a relationship

[17:00]
manufacturer negotiate a relationship
and sell these things in the United
States and so we started doing that two
months ago and
in August yes in August we did $61,000
of sales so far in September we've done
$52,000 of sales but we are on track to
pass our August numbers which is awesome
we have we are in the middle of
negotiating the exclusivity rights to
North America with the manufacturer
which has been awesome we've built out
hired and built out a sales team that we
have actually
qualifying these leads and having
conversations with people and quick plug
we are hiring for two sales positions so
if you're someone who either has been a
Setter or a closer in the past to work
the phones you're good with people and
you want to come work with Chris and I
email us Chris or Nick coof founders.com
anyways so we've been working on
building this infrastructure it's like
anything that you do right it always
takes longer than you think and it
always costs more than you thought but
I'm like Chris and I are both well maybe
I won't speak for you I'm really really
excited about the progress that we've

[18:00]
excited about the progress that we've
made we've got like real systems in
place we've got real follow-up processes
perfuma which is the company that we're
working with has they run on balona time
but we're learning to work with them and
work through it and I'm just stok for
what happens in Q4 oh the last thing is
for the first month we didn't have our
prices dialed in so our gross margin was
like 34% I just crunched the numbers
we've now fixed our pricing and our
gross margins are 43 % so not quite the
50% that we were hoping for but they've
been much improved and I'm stoked it's
awesome I love it I love how you said
fixed our pricing because it reminds me
of whenever you get an email from a
company that's raising their prices they
never say they're raising their prices
they always say like there's a price
adjustment or like we're correcting like
it's just like I I I know what you're
saying our prices were messed up because
we weren't upcharging at all the
accessories so I get what you're saying
but it's also funny let me just explain
it like so there is this perfume vending

[19:01]
it like so there is this perfume vending
machine and then there are accessories
that you can pay for to add on to it
accessories might be a coin or Bill
acceptor credit card acceptor there's a
stand that's an accessory there's a TV
that you can have on it it's an
accessories like all of these things
cost more money the only thing that we
were marking up was the original machine
Any accessory that people purchased we
were just passing through like there was
no markup on that margin which was
insane CU some of these things were an
additional th or500 I think even $2,000
in some cases so we ended up fixing that
where we ended up creating the same
margin on those accessories as we did on
the original unit but that that's what I
mean by fixing pricing because otherwise
it was it was not working did you just
admit to price fixing yeah I did edit
that out
Muhammad what you're saying doesn't make
sense in it because it sounds like we
kind of launched something too fast and
then really screwed up something very
fundamental so I don't think that was up
us are you sure that was us this this

[20:02]
us are you sure that was us this this
has been a fun project though
because I think this is the first time
that you and I Soup To Nuts are like
really in the Wheats together launching
something most of the time we've
launched something it's been like oh
Chris is launching it and I'll come in
and out for a minute or oh Nick's
running this spot this business Chris
will come in and out for a minute but
this has been this has been fun I'm
really excited about the infrastructure
we're building and what this means for
the next
thing that we do because the flywheel is
going my friend it is gaining momentum
it is it is
indeed all right I got a couple little
hacky ideas for you I want you to grade
them I you to grade them they're kind of
similar so I'm going to pair them
together all right I love this because
this is something that like an indie
hacker could build I don't know how
they're going to make a lot of money so
I'm saying that up front it it would be
a fun project and either one has the
opportunity to go viral because of what
they are number one we all order stuff
on Amazon in fact the average American
spends $1,600 a year on Amazon about 10

[21:04]
spends $1,600 a year on Amazon about 10
yeah yep and about 10% of those orders
are late late being all right we expect
it to arrive between 7:00 a.m. and 11:00
a.m. and it arrives that afternoon so it
doesn't have to be the next day just
late yeah now Nick have you ever had
something arve late on Amazon and
complained via like a chat or customer
support I have not my wife has okay well
your wife and I are similar we're both
very frugal MH and we've gone full Caren
on an Amazon associate at some point or
another and Amazon is what is Jeff Bezos
obsessed with the customer experience
the customer experience they are always
wrong the customer is always right okay
and so basically if something arrives
late and you complain about it they will
bend over backwards to make it right
sometimes they'll refund you and let you
keep it I'm sure they have an algorithm
based on the price of the item and what
type of thing it is but basically they

[22:00]
type of thing it is but basically they
will make it right more than they need
to
so at LCD cycle about 10 years ago we
used to use a service called 71 pounds I
don't know if they're still in business
anymore 71 pounds yep yep okay and I
love this business because they would
they had an automation that would
dispute FedEx packages if they were
late from like the shippers perspective
so we shipped a ton of FedEx pack
every day and FedEx has a guarantee in
their terms of service if it's late
we'll give you a refund but you have to
fill out a big form it's a bunch of
paperwork and most of these packages
cost $15 a ship it's just not worth a
business owner's time so they had an
automation that would fill out the form
and send it automatically and their
revenue model was they would take 40% of
everything they saved
you it's a great offer like what do I
have to lose I'm not doing this today
why not right so it is the same model
with Amazon just on a consumer basis so
it's a chatbot basically that is free
and it just logs in your your Amazon

[23:03]
and it just logs in your your Amazon
account through an API which is
currently available and monitors to see
if something's late or not and if it's
late it hops on the chat and goes full
Caren with a customer associate and
saves you money or makes you money back
and it monetizes by taking a percentage
of the savings so whereas 71 pounds was
from the shippers perspective this would
be a chat bot for the consumer yep free
to use because I've never done it on
Amazon you and Jess have obviously you
never talk to anybody it's literally
just a chat bot no it's a human over
chat well that that's what I mean sorry
that's what I mean you're just chatting
with somebody yeah yeah why would you
not make that there's a fairly big
company I forget the name that does this
for like Comcast and AT&T and it will
negotiate your bill it'll say hey I'm
cancelling no no no and it knows what
their script is so it uses that against
them and saves you money so this is like
already an established business even for
consumers why not for Amazon well I mean

[24:02]
consumers why not for Amazon well I mean
it's interesting because if you think
about it broadly a lot of companies make
money because of the friction that they
introduce in their processes
strategically introduced friction we
talked about this last week Healthcare
companies dude lots of healthcare
companies will just blanketly deny
claims to a provider like if I'm a
physician and I build a Healthcare
Company they'll just get an automatic
rejection and then you have to rebu it
and magically they pay you because they
just assume that some percentage of
those Physicians aren't going to rebuild
that claim so they keep it right or
they're like very technical with what
they asked for and maybe something
technically was missing but yeah that's
on the healthcare side of things I read
a statistic once that gift cards there
like 10 to 20% of all gift cards go
unused which is like there's a whole
industry around that right right so it's
like there
are in my mind the Amazon example is an
example of sort of the friction that

[25:00]
example of sort of the friction that
exists with and I don't even know what I
would call it with claiming your full
value basically you know what I mean so
that's an interesting framework to think
about these opportunities from I'm
picturing a reel that could promote this
and that could go viral you ready the
first part is just clips of Jeff bezo
saying the customer our focus is the
customer the customer we're obsessed
about the customer obsessed about the
customer that's like 5 seconds and then
the next 5 seconds are just screenshots
of late late like screenshots from
Amazon or from your email from Amazon
late late we're sorry we're late late
late late late making it seem like it
happens a lot more than 10% because
they're actually quite good at not being
late sure sure and then it's just like
stop getting screwed over with late
Amazon packages disput Ison there it is
disput Ison disput Ison it's the worst
name crap do you going to name cheap
going to name Che I like that I like
that idea I think that's an interesting
idea you're essentially you're
advocating on behalf of the consumer it
could be for Amazon it could be for

[26:00]
could be for Amazon it could be for
Walmart deliveries it could be probably
a service for like disputing credit card
transactions as well cuz yep dude okay
funny
story when I had my first real liquidity
event I didn't buy anything I wanted to
buy something I really wanted to buy a
Lincoln Aviator because they're freaking
super sick cars but I didn't I waited I
didn't buy anything for a year which is
kind of the advice that I heard it was
what it was but I did get one thing you
know what it was you're like it's kind
of the advice that I heard from like the
grown woman that lives with me in my
house No the grown woman that lived with
me said you can't buy anything so oh not
even food all right so the one thing the
one thing that I
got was this card and I know it sounds
stupid American Express for those
listening this was the American Express
Platinum Card and it's metal I mean it
feels super cool in your hand so you had
a a seven figure year liquidity event
and the your one Splurge was a credit

[27:02]
and the your one Splurge was a credit
card with what a $500 annual fee
750 okay and you call me
cheap what anyways so which my wife
hated she's like $750 a year what are we
even getting for this and I was like
it's a metal C Jessica it's a credit
cardal do you hear it I don't what do
you mean I don't understand when I hand
hello hello you're knocking theard when
I hand it to people and they go oh wow
that's what I'm going for here dude
anyways when I decided and I'm doing air
quotes when I decided to cancel that
card before it auto renewed I had to go
I had to cancel it but I didn't talk to
anybody I freaking spent an hour I spent
an hour canceling the stupid freaking
credit card now when you got to go full
Guru and be like and my hourly rate is
way more than $750
I spent probably close to

[28:00]
I spent probably close to
$177,000 just canceling that credit card
worth of time yeah yeah time equals
money anyways because these sales people
are all trained on the same or the
whoever it was on the other end is all
trained on the same thing they like are
you sure we can give you this new promo
rate oh we could actually give you this
XYZ thing to to entice you to stay with
us and it takes forever because they
gotta like get through their script if
you could have a chat bot that like goes
and cancels subscriptions I think they
have that but what we could do is make
like some of these you have to call them
and do it and the technolog is already
here where you can use AI an AI voice to
have that same conversation like we used
to only be able to do over chat so it
could just be the same thing but just
phone calls only I love it take a
percentage of what they save you yeah
overall I love the framework though of
like okay what can we automate or use AI
to take friction or uncomfortable
situations for the consumer because
there are a lot of people you and Jess
you're fine calling up Amazon be like
hey this package was 14 minutes late

[29:01]
hey this package was 14 minutes late
right and whatever you get some refund
me I'm going to be like n that guy's
probably having a hard day it's not
worth it beta you know what I mean yep I
am a
beta you better not call yourself that
you're worth more than that oh Chris
thank you couple weeks ago I had her
name is Lauren rothberger on my
podcast and it was a Nicon omics for
those who don't know my podcast is
called Nic economics and she has a
company that owns commercial real estate
Self Storage ever since that
conversation I have just become not ever
since for a while now I become obsessed
with commercial real estate it's a big
reason why we bought the park in Waco
because I was like dude I want to I
really want to buy some commercial real
estate let's get into this space and
everybody talks about how cool it is and
I've always just thought it'd be so nice
to have a business like a mailbox
business right a mailbox business where

[30:00]
business right a mailbox business where
you just get a check in the mail triple
net lease it's taken care of whatever I
I always view that as like the dream so
to speak anyways so she came on to my
podcast and she talked about the space
and I'm just gonna like do some
overviews do you know what like the
average net margin is for Self Storage
42% yeah it's close it's supposedly it's
between 30 and 40% okay it's like the
average of margin okay now there are
some major Pros to commercial real
estate and I'll list them out Pro number
one it's a real estate back asset so
you're not buying a service as business
that can go down 100% in value because
you lose all your customers like there's
a limited they ain't making more real
estate there's a limited supply of real
estate and that's what's backing this
asset there's a it's a limited Supply so
that helps maintain the value it's got
predictable cash flows which are amazing
it's got fairly High barriers to entry
unless you have some Capital to put down
you can't just buy a self storage it's

[31:01]
you can't just buy a self storage it's
recurring Revenue right everybody in the
SB space loves o it's recurring oh
that's a SAS product and it's not labor
intensive if you have one of these large
self storage facilities you don't have a
bunch of Labor that you're managing so
there's a million things why it's
attractive you get cash flows over time
the asset appreciates it's a very safe
investment there are a lot of cons to it
though right the cons are very limited
upside in that particular facility maybe
you increase rents but you're not going
to like triple your noi every single
year it is capital intensive to expand
so if you want to buy other facilities
you've got to put money into buying more
real estate it's slow and it's steady
getting in is hard right like the first
deal is the hardest because you don't
really know anything about real estate
and you've got to find someone who does
know and if you're going to put $200,000
into a piece of real estate and you're
going to take a million a half dollar
loan like that's a big swing for someone
who doesn't know about the real estate
space right so it's hard to get into and

[32:01]
space right so it's hard to get into and
for the most part in these Self Storage
deals there are no deals right like
everybody wants to look at and be like
oh I want to get it for as cheap as I
can because then there's lots of upside
like no people are paying like four five
six caps for these purchases and what
the cap rate essentially means is that's
the rate of return on the asset value so
it's a little bit above just a treasury
which you're getting 5% at to go buy
real estate these self storage
facilities you're going to purchase them
at a 6 seven cap maybe you'll get a much
better cap but what I'm saying is like
buy and large the deals that you're
seeing that are brokered are kind of in
that space right did I miss anything
with the pros and cons of Self Storage
commercial real estate no I think there
are still deals out there Connor friend
of the Pod he buys Self Storage only off
market and he gets really really good
cap rates there's fewer than mobile home
and RV park storage
but more than people might think off if

[33:00]
but more than people might think off if
off Market that's where I wanted to go
with this like a lot of times we're
focused on the side hustle oh I could
spend this business up and I'm making 50
Grand a year or I could do XYZ thing and
make
$50,000 a pop but I don't think what
people realize is you can do the side
hustle with real estate it doesn't
necessarily produce the same amount of
consistent cash flows but what I mean by
that is Lauren has like a very
predictable process and basically what
she's done is she's become an expert in
her local market she only Buys in her
local market so what she's saying is
like I know where the good areas are the
bad areas are I know what a good price
is and what a bad price is I know what
Market is I also know what people will
pay I
know what developments are being put in
place around them like she knows it so
well that she's able to take a bigger
swing maybe than she other wise would
have to buy something that isn't
necessarily a deal so she becomes an

[34:02]
necessarily a deal so she becomes an
expert in her local
market and then the first property that
she buys was with her money but also she
went and raise some outside investor
money and she did a seller note but the
step three she does some value ad she
rais rents and then she ended up selling
that property and rolling it into
another property right but the piece I'm
trying to take from here is like I think
we spend a lot of time looking for the
side hustle and you can do that that but
I also think that commercial real estate
is a proven way to make anybody a
millionaire over time and if you just
started looking in your local market for
deals and familiarizing yourself with
deals then when the right deal comes
across your plate you can pounce on it
and start getting into the real estate
game the reason I wanted to bring this
up is because I wanted to talk to you
about how would you Source off-market
deals because I'm a big believer in get
your experience on market and then buy
off Market because you're going to get a

[35:01]
off Market because you're going to get a
better deal you probably get better
terms with the seller you'll probably
have a better chance of actually closing
than if you go on Market otherwise you
got to work through a broker Etc but I
also don't think you should go off
Market without having experience first
because that's just a recipe for
disaster so what would you do or how
would you go about looking for that
first P piece of commercial real estate
off Market I think the part about like
looking in your local market is one of
the most important things that you said
there that's just like the big risk is
that you can completely screw something
up because you're looking at something
on a spreadsheet and you're like oh wow
this deal over here in Washington it's
killer deal look at these numbers but
you might not know about zoning
regulation changes or a new employer
coming or leaving town whereas every
single local in that area will know
those things so I I can't emphasize that
enough I don't think it has to be your
local market I think preferably it is
but it has to be the same Market your
first deal at least or a market that you

[36:01]
first deal at least or a market that you
know better than average yeah it's just
too big of a risk right especially if
you're trying to do it as a quote
unquote side hustle once you've got some
experience under your belt maybe you go
into other markets that you don't know
as well because you know what risks to
look for but yeah local market sorry go
ahead I think the biggest benefit of
buying on Market is you've got a third
party hopefully one that you trust that
like blesses the deal maybe it's the
listing broker maybe it's your buying
broker but at least you have someone in
the industry this isn't always the case
there are a lot of terrible Brokers out
there someone in the industry putting
his reputation his or her reputation on
a deal so you can at least feel safe
knowing okay this is listed on the
market other people are looking at it
I'm not crazy whereas if you go find an
off-market property you might have just
called that person on the day that they
found out that they had a massive
environmental issue and they're very
much excited about selling and you don't
know the question questions to ask
whereas if a broker was listening that

[37:00]
whereas if a broker was listening that
he would know so for your first deal on
Market makes a lot of sense how would I
find an off-market deal like driving for
dollars is by far the the least
efficient but most effective which is
just driving around finding a piece of
real estate and talking to the owner
face to face there's always a trade-off
between efficiency and Effectiveness
driving for dollars you can't get any
more efficient than talking to someone
face to face but it's
sorry effective but it's very very
inefficient timec consuming on the
complete other end of the spectrum
effective most efficient is texting
people just saying hey like I love your
property I'm here in the area do you
have any interest in selling and then
getting them on the call as soon as
possible and then getting them in person
as soon as possible that's like both
ends of the spectrum there and I've
actually started doing this is just
getting to know people who let's say
they're at my church or my kids school
and parents of other kids at the kid
school and I hear that they're in real
estate or they're in commercial real

[38:01]
estate or they're in commercial real
estate I just start getting to know them
and asking them questions and and just
saying like hey I'm open if you ever
find a deal in this area you've got to
get your reps in even going and talking
to Brokers and just understanding what
is a good cap rate what do I look at and
due diligence what makes sense when the
right deal actually does come your way
you're going to screw it up you're gonna
think oh I gotta get a better price oh I
gotta get better terms oh I got to get
whatever because you don't actually know
what Market is and I see so many
first-time buyers so many first- time
buyers is f up because they just don't
know how the deal process works like
they think something's way more
important than it actually is because
they just don't understand it they're
scared they don't know all the risks or
all of the non- risks that look like
risks that actually go into the deal
process so I think just getting started
and starting to look and just saying
okay a year from now I'm going to buy my
first property but this first year I'm
just getting my reps in I'm just getting
my reps in because if you can get into
that a self storage facility and you can
get into these with $100,000 down there
like I'm not saying it's easy to get

[39:00]
like I'm not saying it's easy to get
$100,000 but given enough time and
enough self-discipline you can get
$100,000 and once you get into that
first one and it's cash flowing then you
start building Equity then you can take
the equity from that and roll it into
another one again it's not g to make you
a million dollars overnight but it is
the most proven and consistent way to
make you a millionaire over time yeah
the hard part is like The Listener base
of this myself included cuz I listen to
my own podcast is the opposite bias for
action let's start now let's sell it
before you have it let's buy the domain
name right this second that's the
opposite advice of what is needful in
commercial real estate if you want to
get into commercial real estate like I
do you can still have a bias for Action
bias for Action is just starting to talk
to people like getting to Deals like
understanding the process right it's
hard to direct that the right way
because I think most people in like they
translate that to me I want to buy a
park or yeah because there's not the
same soon as I can yeah yeah yeah
there's not the same dopamine hit like
seeing the results yeah all right what

[40:00]
seeing the results yeah all right what
you think if you end up starting that
electronics recycling fundraiser
business please let us know and we will
feature you on the show we want to know
how it goes share with a friend see you
later
