[00:00]
welcome to the ker office where I
primarily do two things I talk about
business ideas and execution strategies
and then I go deep on different
industries that are approachable for
most people today I wanted to talk about
ATMs because ATMs are like vending
machines and everyone loves vending
machines except ATMs are even more
passive than vending machines so what
better guy to talk to about ATM machines
than the ATM guy from Twitter Mitchell
he's great and he has 900 ATMs across
Los Angeles that make him
$864,000 per year in net profit and
didn't cold call to get all these
locations he bought them and the
multiples are much much lower than you
might think this is an approachable
business for anyone it's wellestablished
industry lots of room for disruption and
then at the end of the episode we talk
business ideas that have nothing to do
with the ATM industry one in the AI
sphere that I think you will find
interesting and you probably haven't
heard of so please like And subscribe
share with a friend that might be
interested in businesses like these and
we will see you next
[Music]
time so why don't you tell us who you
are and what you

[01:01]
are and what you
do yeah first of all thank you for
having me on really appreciate it my
name is Mitchell I am the ATM guy on
Twitter and I've spent the last three
years kind of spending all of my time in
the ATM business L rewind took a little
bit spent most of my 20s building
internet businesses a polar opposite
world and at some point in my late 20s
decided I wanted to buy a cash flowing
business I just fell into the world of
SMB Twitter just started reading about
search trying to like soak up as much
information as I could and kind of
randomly purely out of serendipity
stumbled into an ATM deal and the seller
originally was selling like 400 machines
it was a much larger deal than I wanted
to do and my brother was my partner in
the business I told him why don't we
just go and ask this guy if he'll just
piece off a few machines to us and we
can say like this is our way of getting
our feet wet and we'll come back to you
for a larger acquisition afterwards it's
a good idea and to my surprise he said
yes and so we ended up buying three
machines the deal is
36,000 for 1K a month in cash flow so

[02:01]
36,000 for 1K a month in cash flow so
it's basically exactly a three-year
multiple and there's some details about
the way that people present ATM deals
that we can talk about later but that
was how we perceived the multiple at the
time and end up being slightly higher
than that but yeah so we bought those
three machines we ran them for about
five weeks maybe six weeks we fell in
love with the business and we ended up
buying 20 more a few months later then
another 40 and then we did a bunch of
smaller deals and now we're up to over
900 machines okay okay amazing I want to
back up you were in the tech world and
then you said I want to buy a cash
flowing business which is a great idea
were you just like window shopping on
bis by cell or how did you get from that
thought to ATMs more specifically
originally we were just like shopping
around we made like a short list of
qualities that we wanted to avoid and
the main one was like high labor
intensity so in other words we decided
that we did not want to buy a
landscaping or an agac or a plumbing
company and have to manage like 30 or 40

[03:02]
company and have to manage like 30 or 40
people we just want to remove like the
keyman risk out of our acquisition and
my brother is really good at managing
capital and so it was just kind of like
we'd rather remove that unknown of of
human capital out of the equation as
much as possible and so that led us to
launder mats and self-served car wash
and vending and like businesses that
fall into that camp how we stumbled on
an ATM deal specifically was we
originally were looking at a vending
deal and I think my brother asked the
seller why he was selling the guy said
oh I want to focus all my time on my ATM
business and so that kind of like piqued
our interest that we started going down
that rabbit hole that sounds like Quinn
Miller right you I'm sure you follow him
yeah yeah he's a good friend of mine
that sounds like his story you mean it
sounds like his preference because I had
him on the podcast a few months ago and
he's got all these vending machines and
a few ATM machines and one of the
questions I asked him was what's next

[04:00]
questions I asked him was what's next
and he's like
ATMs interesting so yeah he's bullish on
those I didn't know that he was that
I knew he liked it but he must
be like really focusing on that more now
than he was previously I think he's
carving out a niche with ATMs in hotels
specifically he's finding some good
success there yeah yeah I mean Quinn is
a beast at cold calling so like his yeah
his whole growth strategy is completely
different than ours in a lot of ways
like I'm jealous that he just sits there
and pounds the phone and I think he'll
build a big business that way when it
came to you requesting from the broker
to peel off a few machines why do you
think it was that they said yes because
I could see this one of two ways they
say no because it's messy it's hairy
it's too small for us they say yes
because it's been sitting for a while
better than nothing had it been sitting
for a while or why do you think they
said yes the guy that we bought from is
actually quite known in the city as the
guy who builds routes and sells them I
think we got really lucky that he listed

[05:00]
think we got really lucky that he listed
it as 400 machines but in reality he was
willing to sell one or 80 or 180 right
so it was less that like I convinced him
to sell three instead of 400 and more
that that's just kind of his business um
the cool thing about ATMs is that you
can piece off a part of your portfolio
and it's not like there's specific
overhead that comes with that right so
you can have 15 machines or you could
have,
1500 and really it's just more admin
work but it's not like the labor
intensity doesn't scale with the size of
your portfolio if that makes sense which
is probably rare right for any other
industry that would probably not be the
case yeah maybe software what city city
are you in again I'm in la la okay now
when it came to the seller one thing
that might worry me is if I ask him to
peel off three out of 400 he's going to
give me the three dogs and save the best
for the the big seller but on the other
hand he could say you know what I'm

[06:00]
hand he could say you know what I'm
optimistic this guy's going to come back
and buy more I want to make sure that he
has three good machines or at least one
or two really good locations because I
imagine the location matters quite a lot
in this business it does but thing is
ATMs are incredibly predictable in terms
of looking at their historic performance
and then projecting that you know six 12
18 months out so we looked at the last
two years of transaction history on
these
machines and that is what we based the
multiple off of and so you don't really
care whether it's like good locations or
bad locations because you're just paying
a multiple on that ATM's performance
right so there are some details there
where it's like you know it's probably
riskier to buy a location that does a
thousand transactions a month than it is
to buy 10 locations step back for a
second it's definitely riskier to buy
one location that does a th000
transactions than 10 locations that do
100 each just because of customer con
concentration but then also the

[07:02]
concentration but then also the
locations that are really busy are
incredibly competitive and the owners
know that they have really high value
real estate and so they're constantly
trying to get better deals and so I I
kind of like veered off the path there
but yeah well I do that all the time I
have ADHD so it's gonna happen like 12
times this interview so I would also
think that like the location matters
based on price sensitivity right maybe
some locate because part of your
strategy which I'd like to touch on at
some point is increasing the fees and is
that less possible at certain locations
compared to others it's definitely less
possible and not because of price
sensitivity and only because of the
owner of the location so it's actually
like one of the most annoying and
frustrating parts of this business is
handling like depending on how many
machines you have obviously but like
dozens or hundreds or thousands of micro
relationships with these store owners
and these guys who own a nart that

[08:01]
and these guys who own a nart that
probably makes like 3540 Grand a year
and they are the employee and the
bottleneck in the business and they just
sit there all day you know they will see
you raise the ATM fee from 3 to 350 and
they'll call you and tell you that
nobody's going to come to their store
anymore because it's 50 cents more which
is complete nonsense but it doesn't
matter because it's their call correct
it's not their call most of the time if
you're smart about the way that you
draft your language and your contracts
but when you inherit a location when you
buy it you're inheriting whatever the
contract was previously or if there is
no contract then it is their call
because they could just tell you that
take your machine if you're gonna raise
the price so yeah well like in any
business deal even if contractually you
can do that you still want to maintain
the good healthy relationship right yeah
of course of course okay all right so
how much due diligence were you able to
do on those three locations did he let
you talk to the owners did you even need
to did the talk to the owners what did

[09:00]
to did the talk to the owners what did
that look
like yeah so typically it's just looking
at transaction history from the
processors it's looking at the contracts
and the language in them when they were
signed when they're going to expire and
whether they Auto renew or not I'd say
that's like the bulk of the diligence
especially when you're just buying three
machines or eight machines or whatever
in terms of talking to the owners you
actually don't really want the owners to
know at all that it was sold because
again it just opens up this situation
where they now want to demand a higher
commission or they start saying like
where's the other guy I liked him he
took care of me are you GNA pay me on
time so in an Ideal World when you buy
an ATM location nothing changes the cash
loader is the same because you're third
party Contracting it if you're going to
start loading it or your employees are
and the cash loader changes then ideally
you ask the guy who owned it previously
to tell him hey I'm bringing in these
other guys so if you see this guy coming
in he's just helping out or whatever at

[10:00]
in he's just helping out or whatever at
the end of the day like 99% of ATM
contracts if there are contracts that
you're purchasing don't say anything
about assignment so if it's silent On
Assignment it can be reassigned and so
yeah that that's typically the way that
you want to structure it okay and did
you have any Hang-Ups with this first
deal as far as assigning things no we
still have those three locations today
it's been almost three years we did have
an issue with one of them where one of
them demanded a higher commission we
ended up giving it to him and then I
think one of them um the transaction
volume fell off for whatever reason
there are lots of risks that are like
completely out of your control when it
comes to like a neighborhood changing or
gentrifying or they open up construction
on the street and for six months like
nobody goes to that store anymore
there's all this kind of stuff okay so
what did it look like post acquisition
how long did you wait to change anything
or to raise fees and then what did the
next three years look like compared to
your projections how long did we wait to
raise fees I don't remember exactly I

[11:01]
raise fees I don't remember exactly I
know that for the first like two or
three months we definitely didn't touch
anything on those three locations when
we bought the next batch which is like
another 20 machines I remember we we had
like two or three really low stakes
locations that did like maybe 15 or 20
transactions a month and we started
raising prices on those first and we
basically just made more money it was
like 15 20% increase in net and we were
like okay let's just start doing this on
all of the machines okay
and then we started to learn the issues
with like negotiating with the store
owners and so we bought those three then
another like I said it was about 20
maybe 18 or 20 from the same guy and
then we bought another 15 or 20 from him
again in total that route today is down
on transaction volume but is up in net
so it's down in transaction volume for a
few reasons one is like those kind of
out ofy control factors that I just
mentioned a minute ago and another is
like we lost locations to places just

[12:00]
like we lost locations to places just
like shutting down going out of business
selling to somebody else the guy just
kicking us out whatever right I don't
know the numbers off top my head but I
do know that if it was supposed to do
like 5,800 or 6K a month in cash flow
when we bought it it does like 6,500 to
7K a month today on 20% less transaction
volume and that's all just a function of
us raising prices okay so take me back
again to the timeline in number of units
so three years ago you bought three then
you added 20 from the same guy and then
take me from there until today after we
bought the next two batches from that
guy we basically stopped for like maybe
four or five months we had gotten to a
level where it was like slightly
overwhelming we were loading everything
ourselves and so we were like driving
around fixing machines loading cash we
were like okay let's take a breather and
get accustomed to this and then I think
like maybe early that summer or mid that
summer I don't remember the timing
exactly we had this broker reach out to
us
and we bought like one of the best deals

[13:02]
and we bought like one of the best deals
that we've ever purchased to date it was
Tiny it was 30k but it was doing like
206 or 2700 a month wow yeah and all of
the sear charges multiple yeah less than
1X but on top of that all the search
charges were like 225 and
250 there were no contracts and the guy
was like really old and so that's why I
sold it for so cheap because he was like
no contracts I'm running out of time so
so he just he basically dumped it and we
raised all the prices to 350 and that
route still today makes like 4500 a
month that we bought for 30k that was
like the Home Run of home runs
unfortunately for 30k instead of 3
million but that was the next one we did
and then we just like overtime started
buying small routes here and there as
they popped up and then last year we did
our two biggest Acquisitions that added
the vast majority of the 900 machines
that I mentioned on the beginning of
this call and we brought in LPS for that
rais most of the money on Twitter and so

[14:02]
rais most of the money on Twitter and so
I don't know if that answers your
question but that was kind of like the
trajectory all right if you are watching
this clip right now you are watching
this on YouTube and if you are a fan of
podcast please check out my podcast
while you're at it because sometimes I
have podcasts that aren't on YouTube and
sometimes I have YouTubes that aren't on
podcast so check out the ker office on
any podcast platform or you can go to
TKO pod.com also my newsletter will
throw that in there there are no ads
It's weekly it's different content than
my podcast and YouTube newsletter.
chrisj cerner.com you see the link and
we'll see you there so you're at 900
today give or take yeah correct there's
a cave out there that like a big portion
of that is processing locations and I
don't know if you're familiar with the
difference between loc okay so there's
kind of two camps in ATMs one is
locations that you own and load and then
the other is locations that you process
so that means when you process a
location it means somebody else owns the
machine somebody else loads the cash in
it they keep all of the sech

[15:01]
it they keep all of the sech
charge but there's an additional form of
Revenue on on ATM transactions that's
called interchange and interchange is
basically this payment that's made from
the networks to the processors so visa
and Mastercard or pulse or any of these
networks pay the processor for basically
allowing the transaction to happen and
interchange like gross interchange
that's paid out is anywhere between 25
and 40 cents per transaction
and it depends on what kind of card was
used the type of story you're in like
there there's like a bunch of different
factors nobody really it's kind of a
black box that I think is by design made
that way it's really confusing you talk
to people who are like 20 years into the
business and they don't fully understand
interchange a lot like processing the
same issue correct correct but
regardless there's that like 25 to 40
cents of gross interchange that's paid
out and then the processor keeps some
and gives the rest to the ATM operator
and as you get bigger and bigger you

[16:00]
and as you get bigger and bigger you
negotiate more and more of that back and
it becomes this like middleman above a
middleman above a middleman and so
processing portfolios are basically just
smaller ATM operators under you you give
them 80% of The Interchange and you keep
20% of it and so it's like fully passive
machine breaks it's on them machine runs
out of money it's on them so okay so out
of those north of n 900 machines that we
have I want to say like around 50 it's
basically Bally 50-50 own and load and
and processing okay and what does that
represent in monthly or annual revenue
Andor iida so our Revenue across all the
entities is around 180k a month it's a
little bit comp like I mentioned to you
on the before we hopped on the call it's
like a little bit complicated talking
about the flows of the revenue because
we have our entity and then we have that
we brought investors in for but our eida
margins have been in the range of 40% on

[17:00]
margins have been in the range of 40% on
our wholly owned entity since day one
I'd say that that's like relatively
standard in the ATM business because the
way that you really think about it is
like if there's a $3 search charge a
dollar goes to the a dollar goes to the
cash loader a dollar goes to the store
owner and you keep a dollar and our
surch charge is higher than that and I'd
say most ATM operators that are smart
about their portfolio have raised prices
beyond that and so like when you just
look at a gross margin perspective
that's the math there okay so wow those
are amazing margins and it makes sense
like you said because it's very cut and
dry like it's you don't have to have a
ton of overhead do you even have like an
office or a warehouse that you
need we do we do have an office and we
have a storage unit we have two storage
units actually and then we have one
office admin that basically runs like
all of the back office stuff okay now
have you acquired any locations by cold
calling or or on your your own or have
you acquired them all acquired 95% of

[18:04]
you acquired them all acquired 95% of
them yes I have in the beginning I as I
was driving around and loading machines
myself I would like stop into a place
and say hey how come you guys don't have
a machine I probably placed like maybe
15 or 20 locations in the three years
I've been in the business not
surprisingly at all all of the best
locations that I've placed have come
from Twitter it's just like
inbound like we we got like one of one
of the most incredible actually the best
location in our entire portfolio came
from Twitter like six months ago but
driving R is just kind of like a bad Roi
ATMs are a very mature Market they've
been around a long time it's incredibly
unlikely that you're going to walk into
a place that doesn't have an ATM and has
never had one and place one in there and
it's going to be an amazing location it
would have already had an ATM in there
so that's not to say you can't go out
and grind and pound the pavement and
build the route you can it's gonna take
a very long time and you were saying
earlier you're pretty as long as you
stick to Los Angeles you're pretty

[19:00]
stick to Los Angeles you're pretty
Supply constrained right you can't just
scale as much and as fast as you want
yes again it's it really or not again we
haven't talked about this but it really
depends on how you're cash loading the
machine so if you yourself are loading
them or your employees are loading them
then your route density matters a lot
right so if you have 20 machines in like
a 10 square block radius it's going to
be a lot easier to load that than
something that's like scattered all over
the place would be spending all of your
time driving and so in that sense you're
limited in scalability but if you third
party load it and you have other guys
loading your machines then it's
infinitely scalable it doesn't really
matter but you still have to find deals
to acquire in that case right yeah yeah
correct okay would are you more
interested in scaling to a different
geography or like if you had to choose
between a different geography or just
stay where you're at you can't scale at
all anymore what would you prefer
I think it really depends on your goals

[20:02]
I think it really depends on your goals
like I think if you want to build a big
ATM business you really have no choice
but to go outside of your local
geography there's just not enough deals
there's not enough people selling and
even if there are a lot of people
selling most of the deals are going to
be pretty bad overpriced seller you
can't really trust etc etc okay I'm
curious about the deal that you got from
Twitter that is your best location I'm
sure you don't want to spill all the
beans there but I'm more generally I'm
very curious about locations that you
just wish you could copy and paste right
or locations that are surprisingly or
unexpectedly high volume or very
profitable and what those look like and
and why you think they're like that I
don't mind talking about it at all I
actually tweeted about it when it
happened because it was a hilarious
story I got a call from this guy and he
said he needed an ATM like what kind of
location is it he said it's a dispensary
it's like okay how'd you get my number
he said oh
the rabbi from my synagogue referred you

[21:03]
the rabbi from my synagogue referred you
what what are you talking about he's
like I don't know I'm like okay well
when do you need the ATM and he's like
now I'm like what do you mean now he's
like today like right now like you've
never gotten a call that had any of
these elements in it and this one had
all of them yeah and so I look up the
address I I happen to have an ATM in my
garage I was like how many transactions
does it do he's like probably about a
thousand a month and like you know your
audience is have any context on that
right now but that is anything that does
a th000 transactions a month is like
anything above that is probably one in
5,000 ATM locations or one in 10,000 H
so I was like okay fine I went in my
garage I programmed it I'm Russian also
this guy ended up being russan we really
hit it off and so anyway that that ended
up being the best account that we have
it when we first installed a machine it
did do a th000 transactions a month in
the first month and then the second
month it did like 1,400 and then 1,600
and today it does like almost
2,000 wow so then sent answer or like

[22:02]
2,000 wow so then sent answer or like
the second part of your question what
are the best locations and the ones that
I would like to copy paste I'd say that
and then you also mention surprising
yeah I will say that the best ATM
locations are not really surprising it's
going to be casinos and strip clubs and
cannabis dispensaries right probably the
most competitive as well I imagine
correct right so like strip clubs
completely dominated casinos mostly
owned by the casino owner ERS themselves
or just outsourced to these like Mammoth
companies so really hard to get into any
of those SL just
impossible
dispensaries more doable but
dispensaries have like on a timer
because I don't know if you know
anything about like the safer Banking
Act and them trying to push regular
payments into the Cannabis industry but
like as long as cannabis is federally
illegal visa and MasterCard is not going
to process payments so you can't just
walk in and swipe a credit card at a
dispensary
and it's very likely that's going to

[23:01]
and it's very likely that's going to
change at some point and so if you put
an ATM in a strip club that's never
going to change like people are going to
be using cash at strip clubs probably
forever but it's not the case with the
dispensaries so yeah I guess that was my
way of trying to answer all the pieces
of that question when you grew so fast
at that dispensary were you growing in
step with his growth or were you taking
more of his market quote if that makes
sense yeah no it's a few things and this
is just me guessing but I'm almost
certain that I'm right about this just
from having experience in the business
but usually what happens
is when a store owner loads the machine
thems which is the which was the case
there and I'll I'll I'll explain what
happened there in a second but when a
store owner loads a machine themselves
usually they do a pretty bad job they're
just focused on running their business
the ATM runs out they don't have enough
20s on hand they scramble to get the
cash they end up uploading it a day
later when people keep showing up to

[24:01]
later when people keep showing up to
your store and the ATM is constantly out
of service they just know that like oh I
need to go I need to go get cash before
I go to this place because or I'm gonna
go to a different place or I'm gonna go
to a different place yeah exactly so I
suspect that that's what was happening
there um especially because it was so
high volume so like a location like this
you need to have you just can't have
less than 10K in there at all times
basically and really should have like 20
or 30k in there and so unless you run an
ATM business and you have an armored
truck that'll get you the cash or you
have an ATM program with your bank it's
really hard to get your hands on that
many 20s and so we took over we put in a
brand new machine we kept it loaded all
the time slowly people started to know
that it was just always in service and
the volume grew that way so yeah I mean
just you having a a workable ATM a
reliable ATM grew his business because I
there were a lot of people that started

[25:00]
there were a lot of people that started
coming regularly because they knew that
they could count on that
ATM it's possible I'd like to think so I
don't know if that's exactly true but
maybe yeah how much like cash
outstanding do you have at any given
time and how do you manage that so again
as I alluded to earlier there are a few
different ways of loading ATMs and it's
either really there's three ways the
first is you load with your own cash the
second is you Outsource to a third party
which is usually what's called a fter or
a cash loader so that's just another
local ATM guy that's going to put their
cash into the machine and the Third Way
is an armored truck and the armored
truck borrows the money from the bank
you pay interest on the cash from the
bank you pay the armored truck per load
so every time they come to each store
they charge you 80 90 bucks or whatever
Plus the interest on the cash in
scenarios two and three the cash is not
yours so the money you don't have the
Vault combo to the machine you don't
have any access to the Cashman machine

[26:00]
have any access to the Cashman machine
and when somebody comes and withdraws
$200 the cash is pulled from the
customer's account and sent to the vter
and the search chares split between you
and the vter total cash sitting across
all of our machines and let's remove the
processing because that's like machines
we don't even own so it's kind of
cheating to even talk about that number
total cash sitting in all of the
machines at any given time I would guess
is in like the 5 million range I'm just
like throwing at a number I don't really
look at that number because it doesn't
mean anything to me let's just say it's
probably in the range of four to six
million
okay but a big portion of that is
volters Cashers it's to get into that
business you have to have that much on
hand no absolutely not for 900 machines
yeah no no is there a location that you
placed that that did just surprise you
like a gas station that just had crazy
volume yes not a gas station generally

[27:00]
volume yes not a gas station generally
what happens is like you place an ATM or
actually it's mostly that we've
purchased
ATMs where like we looked at transaction
history and it said you know 250
transactions a month or 300 transactions
a month which is like a solid good
location and you're like oh this must be
like a fairly successful liquor store or
whatever and you show up and you're like
how could this place possibly do any
business right we have some locations
here in La where like first of all I
can't even tell you what the business
cells right like you walk in they'll
have like mops and diapers and like a
generator and like you know what I mean
you're just like how are you selling all
these things at once they can't tell you
what they sell they're they're not
allowed exactly and there's just like
stuff everywhere and the Machine is like
buried under like a pile of stuff that
they sell so I'd say that's the most
surprising but mostly it's like pretty
straightforward right like really really
busy liquor store in La is gonna do

[28:00]
busy liquor store in La is gonna do
really well really busy dispensary is
gonna do really well some like Chinese
restaurant in the kind of shady part of
town probably not going to do well so
like if it has a lottery machine inside
typically it does well because those are
cash only so people will come withdraw
from the ATM put it into the scratch
ticket vending machine or whatever so
I'd say it's pretty straightforward it's
rare that you're a surpris is a risk or
liability a big issue for you or you
just send a check to the insurance
company every month and you have you
ever had a stolen or damaged machine
yeah machines get stolen quite
frequently I mean if you have a lot of
them if you
have if you it's just like a law of
numbers right like if you have if you
have 10 of them it's probably going to
be pretty unlikely that one of them gets
stolen but if you have a big route
you're going to have like three four
machines a year stolen at least we don't
have insurance on the machines and the
cash inside of the machines it's like
prohibitively expensive it's just kind
of dumb to have it it's better to

[29:00]
of dumb to have it it's better to
self-insure we have cash and Transit
insurance for when our employees drive
around with our cash you know knock on
wood nothing has ever happened there but
we're covered and then we just have like
general liability if a machine like tips
over and crushes someone's leg or
something interesting so just a cost of
of doing business something you have to
eat yeah yeah we did my brother did
really early on pull into like a
McDonald's parking lot to use the
bathroom and accidentally left the
backpack in the car and he came out the
window was smashed and we I think he had
like four four or five grand in there so
that was like our first that was our
first
help what is like surprisingly difficult
or hairy or complex about this business
that you didn't foresee going into it I
think managing relationships with the
store owners is by far the hardest part
especially when you acquire it's my job
for portions of the route where I was
the one that was introduced like so
especially the stuff early on now it's
just like our office admin handles all

[30:00]
just like our office admin handles all
of it and he's just like the friendly
guy that picks up the phone there's tons
of locations I would say vast majority
of our portfolio I've never met the
owner never spoken to them never been to
the store right so there's a decent
amount of that where it's like it's
actually not a headache when you're just
like oh this guy owns seven gas stations
he could not care less about the ATM
right it's mostly the guys that just
have one store they're in there all day
but yeah I would say that's by far the
most difficult part of the business
you're managing like so many different
cultures people have different
backgrounds ethnicities everyone has
different preferences of the way that
they like to do business they have
different ideas around pricing and what
matters and what doesn't so you have to
have very thick skin and you have to be
really good at just like killing people
with kindness like you know somebody's
like swearing at you and yelling at you
and you're like hey man come on like I'm
just work with me here you know it's
like you got to just like continue like
you can't it's a hardened demographic
right and
yeah just by nature of the job yeah yeah

[31:02]
yeah just by nature of the job yeah yeah
for sure and you can't blame these
people like a lot of them are in really
rough areas they're constantly being
harassed by their customers and so yeah
what would you tell someone that's star
eyed that wants to buy an ATM business
what's like a an optimistic take for
them and then like a hard cold dose of
reality take for them optimistic take is
you're talking about buying one yeah
someone wanted to do it what you're
doing in their Market yeah yeah
optimistic take is that a lot of ATM
operators are extremely
unsophisticated they might sell you
their portfolio at a massive discount to
what it's actually worth they have very
likely underpriced the search charges
and there's a ton of upside there for
you to come and raise prices it's very
scalable so if you're good at the
qualities that are required to run this
business you could go and just keep
buying more of them and the returns are
really good if you pay the right

[32:02]
really good if you pay the right
multiples and run the business correctly
that's the optimistic
take the the other take slap in the face
or whatever you you called it is it's
not passive income it's there's like
tons of like ATM courses selling like
you know passive income from ATM it's
like no it's not it's actually really
really difficult for all the reasons
that I talked about unless you're
willing to get your hands dirty and like
Drive around and learn the business and
do like all like that first like six to
eight months for us was really really
important and so yeah I would say be
prepared to do a lot of like really kind
of blue collar work you don't get to
just click a button and sit in an office
and print money yeah it seems like it's
a good business for someone who's thick
skinned who's like high emotional
intelligence a good people person and
someone who's like systems oriented who
likes and can enjoy building and
following following a good system yeah I

[33:00]
following following a good system yeah I
would agree with that what's next for
you like where would you like to be in
five years in your business I would like
to keep growing I'd say the bottleneck
for us is there's really a shortage of
good deals out there and when I say good
deal priced correctly or underpriced
upside with the sear charges a seller
that you can trust is really important
on the bigger deals that's much less
important if you're buying like five or
six I'd
say but if you buy 400
machines and that guy's been running the
business for 18
years and he's a bit of a jerk and then
you buy it and he's just like oh you
know like see you later like have fun
and then they call these Merchants call
and they're like where is Bob and you're
like I don't know where Bob is I'm
Mitchell like please work with me like
you need to be able to lean on the
seller in these bigger Acquisitions to
to help you with the transition so
finding like a really good person to buy
from and then fairly priced lots of good

[34:00]
from and then fairly priced lots of good
like contract High contract coverage on
the route and good language in the
contracts really hard to come by and so
there's like a shortage of good deals to
deploy large amounts of capital so like
when we find those I pounce on them and
I'd like to do as many of those as
possible and then the stuff that I
mentioned to you in the beginning where
like the route that we bought for 30k or
whatever that was doing 3K a month stuff
like that occasionally pops up that was
the best example of that there's stuff
that's like slightly worse but still
amazing where it's like 15 months or 18
months when stuff like that pops up we
just like write the check immediately
like almost do zero diligence because
it's just like you know you can't fake
ATM processings right you get them
directly from the processor and so yeah
I I think in five years I'd like
to I'd like to have as many of them as
possible but it's just remains to be
seen how many of those deals that we'll
get
why do you think it is obviously it's
not a passive business but I would say

[35:01]
not a passive business but I would say
it's more passive than like a plumbing
HVAC or electrical business why are the
multiples so similar we're looking at
like two to 4X for something like this
and something that's like a really hard
to run business why do you think that is
I'd be lying to you if I told you I know
why I really don't know I think that ATM
multiples are where they are
because there's a lot of fear around the
future of ATM there's a lot of fear
around having to drive around with cash
and load them it seems incredibly
dangerous and I think that if somebody
listed an ATM route for six or seven
years it just nobody would ever buy it
so I don't know I guess that's that's
what I would say that's interesting
because I think I would agree I'm seeing
a lot of parallels in the mobile home
park space like the prices are good
because people think that mobile home
parks are ridden with crime they're not
like some are but some neighborhoods or
apartment complexes are ridden with
crime right so there's that false

[36:01]
crime right so there's that false
perception there's just the ugly
perception that people just can't get
over there's like a pride there there's
an ego thing that people can't get over
I just love little Industries like that
that are overlooked right maybe that's
the only reason that the multiples are
so good is because it's overlooked and
we can talk about it all day but as long
as people have pride ego and fear like
these innate human Tendencies then
they're probably both going to stay good
Industries for the first future so we
talked about this a little bit this is
primarily an ideas podcast are you
seeing any business ideas that are
tangential to your space that look
interesting or exciting to you I had in
the beginning having somewhat of a tech
background like I had some tech ideas
around rebuilding software for ATMs
because like anybody who has ever had
even One ATM and has opened up their
processor like mobile app or or web app
will tell you it's like a peak into like
the late 90s Internet it's hard to
explain how bad it is and so in the

[37:01]
explain how bad it is and so in the
beginning I was like man somebody could
just put out like a nice piece of
software that actually works and scoop
up like all of the processing and the
more I learned about the business the
more I learned that it's just like
that's a pipe dream and you're solving a
problem that your customers don't
actually your potential customers don't
actually care about right like because
as bad as the UI is on these processor
apps they will print the reports that
you need they will show you how much
money is in the machine and that's all
that these ATM operators care about
and it's hard enough to get somebody to
move under your processing by telling
them hey I'm going to give you five
extra cents per transaction or okay
maybe that's a bit extreme let's say
three cents extra per transaction and
you do 100,000 transactions a month
that's three grand a month for you like
just move over and I have like probably
a list of 15 guys that I've been working
on for the last like 18 months trying to

[38:01]
on for the last like 18 months trying to
get them to move over and it's a
relationship building thing where you
keep following up hey how's it going you
talk about business hey have you thought
about moving over and you just keep
following up like once every three
months nobody is move like I I haven't
really been able to get anyone to move
and every time I'm like hey you know
like in the last six months you've lost
like 14 Grand by not moving over like
you could have just and so when I see
that I realized it's just really really
hard to sell anything to ATM people and
so I don't have many ideas that are
tangential to ATMs where it's just like
I think the more mature a market the
harder it is to sell into it but then
once you do the stickier they are so
it's like is that a battle you want to
fight uh or not and it sounds like from
someone in the industry it's not so what
other business ideas are you seeing out
there that might not be related to ATMs
at all because we started geeking out
before I hit record and I want to hear
more about that yeah sure so I've

[39:01]
more about that yeah sure so I've
recently gotten completely obsessed with
a open- source software called comfy UI
and for anyone
who doesn't know what that is basically
if you've heard of stable defusion or
flux or any of these image generation
models comfy UI is this goei that was
built that allows users to play and
manipulate these models in all sorts of
different ways and so I think like the
best way to think about it
is think of a Photoshop that allows you
to play with these models right so like
Photoshop you put a photo in there and
there's like the Clone tool if you've
ever heard of that so you like you know
you like Circle let's say like let's say
this screen that you see right now you'd
like Circle this window shade and then
you'd click somewhere else and start
painting and it would start painting
whatever is here right so there's like
code on the back end that is doing that

[40:00]
code on the back end that is doing that
but Photoshop abstracted away all of
that nerdy technology on the back end
and gave the user like a userfriendly
tool called the Clone tool same exact
thing is happening here with comy UI and
so you can build these things called
workflows that do all sorts of things
for you and I was telling you I was like
excited to tell you about this because I
think like a guy like you is just going
to watch like a 20-minute video on comfy
UI and instantly just have a hundred
different ideas and I think like there's
for every single vertical whether it's
B2B or B Toc there's like some
application out there that can be built
with this thing and so I'm just like
spending all of my free time learning
the software because I think once you
understand the
tools it's going to be really really
easy to just like put out micro SAS for
basically any industry with this thing
yeah you were talking about virtual
staging right and I'm thinking since the
cost to generate these images is so much
lower than it's ever been is there a

[41:00]
lower than it's ever been is there a
world where you could go scrape Zillow
or realtor.com scrape existing listings
and then have the workflow Auto stage
virtually stage some of the rooms send
it to the realtor as like a kind of a
cold C very customized cold email that
costs real money right but it's kind of
like the equivalent of you go get your
school pictures and they have a big
watermark on them and then you can buy
them you send them with a big Watermark
and then instead of paying 200 for them
like they're used to doing they could
pay 20 for them is that Bingo an
opportunity correct yeah that's that's
exactly right and copy paste in any real
estate Niche like it doesn't have to be
residential yeah it doesn't have to be
real estate either like what about like
Cosmetic Dentists for example or like
veneer clinics like they could scrape
images of you smiling put new teeth on
you cold email hey this is what it would
look like if you had new teeth right so
it's just like and that you just like
literally take that idea copy paste it

[42:00]
literally take that idea copy paste it
into any number of
Industries yeah I'm picturing like
scraping you know because every state
has like a Dental Board website where
they list all the Cosmetic Dentists or
dentist assuming there's head shots
there scrap this would be creepy but
creepy is good in this case scraping the
head shot putting like this Big Bright
Beautiful Smile on them which they
probably already have because they're
cosmetic dentist but it's different
they'll recognize that's not their smile
cold emailing it to them and saying hey
like you could white like you could wh
label this through us to your end
customers you could charge whatever you
want for it or it could just you know
will charge you for it and it could be
free to your end customers yep or like
tattoo shops like right now tattoo shops
good friend of mine I was asking him he
has a bunch of tattoos I'm like when you
go and you're exploring like whatever
tattoo you want to buy do they show you
images of it on your body he's like no
of course not they just show you like a
template of course not dude it's
possible they could yeah I know
look that's too good an idea of course

[43:01]
look that's too good an idea of course
not that makes too much sense yeah I'm
super excited about this thing there's
companies nowadays that all they do is
paint uh brick Holmes white like that's
all they do and I mean you could just
blanket yeah you could just blanket a
neighborhood I mean in Texas literally
every home is like a maroon red brick
you could just blanket a neighborhood or
these companies could with a picture of
their home white with like black trim
really modern snazzy looking and then
it's like it plants a seed in their head
was like I kind of like that you know
yeah and it's personalized yeah yeah
yeah oh man we could talk we could talk
for hours just about this like you could
do it with pools you could do it like
here's what this pool would look like in
your backyard and only send it to people
with million dooll homes wedding
planners kitens wedding planners
Landscape Architects painters like it's
literally it's endless yeah and like the
other thing is
there there are more and more tools
coming out every single day for comy UI

[44:01]
coming out every single day for comy UI
because it's open source and so like
these nodes are all just built by
independent developers they have nothing
to do with comfy UI and you can yourself
go and build custom nodes as well and so
yeah I I just think it's only going to
get better and better there's just going
to be like more and more capability
within the program and so yeah what are
some good resources for people to learn
about how to do what you're talking
about so I've gone like down such a
rabbit hole now but I would say that
Reddit is a good place to start so if
you go to the subreddit r/ comfy UI it's
quite small for now I think there's like
30 or 35,000 members in it but there's a
ton on YouTube there's a guy called his
channel is called latent Vision he's
really good guy named Mato from Italy
and he's also developed a bunch of
custom nodes and so he has videos
explaining each custom node and then he
also has like a beginner video just
explaining what comfy UI is the one
caveat is that
it does take a lot of compute like it
takes a lot of GPU to run complex

[45:02]
takes a lot of GPU to run complex
workflows and so like if you try to do
this on like a basic Chromebook or
something it's just going to crash and
so if you really want to maximize the
utility out of this thing you have to
get a virtual machine and just be using
like a really strong graphics card
that's like sitting in a server
Warehouse somewhere what are some good
companies that offer that so we use a
company called comfy deploy but it's not
very cheap they have like a lot of
additional features that they offer that
I was willing to pay for while I'm
learning this thing but it's like $1,000
a month so that one's not cheap
but if you know anything about VMS like
you can use like I'm pretty sure you
could just use like digital Ocean or
thin link client is another one that I
use basically like you just look up any
you just go and look up GPU VM okay
virtual machine yeah exactly and it's
cheap like you can get access to like a
really nice graphics card and all of the

[46:01]
really nice graphics card and all of the
compute power that you need probably for
like 50 bucks a month wow okay and you
don't have to have much technical
knowledge you don't have to be a
software engineer to learn this no I
will say you have to be decent with
computers like sure you know or at least
know how to use chat GPT quite well or
yeah exact you have to be resourceful
you have to be good at Googling stuff
and looking it up on Reddit and
following instructions but yeah
I will say the learning curve is steep
like I'm I'm not g to sit here and tell
you that like comfy UI is super easy to
use I think that that's going to change
over time and it'll become easier but
yeah as of now you don't need to be a
coder but you need to have some computer
savvy yeah imagine like the deadly Trio
skill set of knowing how to scrape leads
knowing how to do cold Outreach to those
leads and then knowing how to do comfy
UI and just putting those together yes
endless opportunity
ities well I'm gonna I'm going to dive

[47:00]
ities well I'm gonna I'm going to dive
down a rabbit hole as soon as I hang up
here I'm sure you will I'm sure you will
okay that's awesome well Mitchell thank
you for your time where can people find
you if they want to find you I'm on
Twitter as the ATM guy my handle is
Mitchell sorin my email is Mitchell
sorin ATM and that's pretty much it
sorin atm.com
yeah okay all right how do we feel about
the ATM Biz please leave me a rating
review and just thanks for listening
even if you don't you know what thanks
for being here I appreciate you
