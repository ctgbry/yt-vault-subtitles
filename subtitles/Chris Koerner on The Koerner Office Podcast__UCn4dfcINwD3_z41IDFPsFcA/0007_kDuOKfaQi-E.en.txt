okay I'm convinced my new favorite
billionaire is the raisin can's founder
and here's why first of all he owns a 66
milliony Old Triceratops school also he
named the business after his dog um he's
worth $7.2 billion he owns 90% of Raisin
canes the idea for raisin canes came
from a business plan competition in
college at LSU and guess what he got a
bad grade on it um he worked at an oil
refinery total bro he hates expanding
the menu he keeps it dead simple crinkle
cut fries Texas toast and chicken
tendies no salads they have no
franchises they're all corporate owned
which is why you get really good service
think Chick-fil-A and he's a big
philanthropist he gives away a ton of
money and he loves his community so Todd
Graves I want to be you when you grow up
