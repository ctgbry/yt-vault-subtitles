[00:00]
and we can do a 3,000 foot house in 20
to 25 minutes start to finish set up
tear down everything that's a$ four to
$500 job so the economics is they're
just
[Music]
incredible what's going on everyone
welcome to another episode of the ker
office today is my first interview so
I'm obsessed with both franchisees and
franchisors and how that whole business
kind of works and I'm also obsessed with
pressure washing I think it's a cool
business and so I talked to my friend
Aaron Harper he's the CEO and founder of
a franchising company called rolling
Suds and they have a couple hundred plus
territories they just launched like a
year or two ago they're growing like
crazy and I thought this was an
interesting conversation because a you
get to learn how a 100 plus million
dollar businesses run he's not quite
there yet but he's getting there really
fast and B you get to learn how a
$500,000 business is run so you get the
best of both worlds because most people
run $500,000 businesses and not $500
million businesses I'm interested in
both and so I got to hear about the

[01:01]
both and so I got to hear about the
pressure washing business from both a
franchisees perspective and a
franchisor's perspective we broke down
some numbers talked about his origin
story and I think you like it so let me
know what you think and we get into the
conversation talking about how he got
started in franchising so enjoy and so I
called A buddy of mine that I went to
college with and he was like you should
get into franchise development and I was
like what's franchise development
because like many of the people who are
watching this listening to it I thought
that franchising was just McDonald's and
Chick-fil-A and I had heard horror
stories about like Quiznos and Subway
and stuff like that but he opened my
eyes to like this whole Home Service
realm where you can bu into a service
company and I love the idea of helping
people become business owners and so
emailed his boss every three weeks for
six months until he hired me that worked
at the largest Carpet Cleaning company
in the world helped grow that you were
selling territories for them yep and
what was wild man is I would sell a

[02:02]
what was wild man is I would sell a
territory or sell a franchise you'd buy
two three territories or whatever and I
would call him a couple weeks after and
just see how his ramp up processes are
going and he'd be like no one's
contacted me yet and I think I'm
supposed to train in two weeks holy cow
and he just dropped 50 Grand per
territory 780,000 uh on like startup
expenses so I would push back obviously
on the network and be like what the heck
and they be like oh blah blah blah
whatever and and it just it was brutal
then eventually this organization was
like yeah if you don't get in line we're
you're not going to rise up in this
company you need to make make right with
the other because I I care about
franchisees these people are taking very
seriously they're giving us you have to
develop a relationship to sell something
for 60 Grand right it's and then you're
kicking them to the curb or at least
your bosses yeah and it was I think and

[03:02]
your bosses yeah and it was I think and
this is one of the challenges that I
just see in franchising is like we had
our sales arm and then operations and
then there was like marketing and no one
was talking to each other and so I'd go
in to be like hey anyways so it just
drove me crazy I still believed in the
model of franchise and there were still
people who did well despite it all and
they had support that they wouldn't have
otherwise had and that company was then
purchased by a private equity-backed
Restoration company that does a couple
billion a year and they wanted to deploy
capital and build a portfolio of
Brands and so they bought the company I
was working for cash said this isn't a
buy and flip type situation we're buying
and holding for and so I was encouraged
by that they bought a brand in the
drywall repair space they bought it from
a Founder who exited immediately there
were 100 locations sold 40
franchises and I was the first full-time
employee on the business that after the

[04:02]
employee on the business that after the
acquisition I was like I'm not putting
anyone in this system we don't have a
system we got to fix it we got to figure
out ugly needed yeah like it
was think about it if you've got a
hundred locations and they all need to
get profitable and you have no employees
so we basically we hired a brand
president and him and I what did he sell
for the drywall company at least I don't
know exactly but at least a few million
thanks so he was just this owner was
just slanging territories
just just people would fly to him every
month or so and he would just do this
training and say good luck call me if
you need
anything so he would so he had no
experience in franchising he had a cool
idea which was drywall holes and walls
need to be repaired and there's not a
niche company that that does that so had
a great idea was a phenomenal
salesperson and he would fly to them and
train them and and then yeah like no

[05:00]
train them and and then yeah like no
no support really yeah wow and and so
there were some franchises who were
doing well but they were doing well
because they were they persevered and
that's who they are and they would have
done well at anything so I think a good
p a big piece of being a franchise or is
being a listener so before we started
selling territories we hired a brand
president and him and I went on a
listening tour and asked everyone what
they needed from us what did they think
they were going to get that they didn't
get where is their business today where
do they want it to be in 5 years what do
they need for from us in order to help
them get there and really just let them
know that like we're there to support
them and that's what what that's why we
bought the company and we built systems
around everything the franchises needed
we reverse engineered it we put our our
first franchisee on the road this was
all happening in covid by the way it was
2020 and the franchisee was Cash flowing
his first month after training we turned
leads on for him at training he had a
full-time skilled laborer hired prior to

[06:01]
full-time skilled laborer hired prior to
to training that we helped them recruit
and he did just under $30,000 his first
month in business with a 30% just patch
and drywall holes literally and really
he wasn't even doing the work he was
growing the business but his skilled
laborer was doing everything correct
which is I think the right way to do
things yeah just in in general a lot of
franchise ERS are like no you go do the
drywall repair and my thought process
I'm I think franchising should help
people build assets and not jobs any
you're the worker be doing it like
you're the job it's hard to build the
business when you're the one doing the
job so I felt we were prepared to grow
that company at that point we didn't we
built a business not from scratch from
negative scratch you know what I mean
like we had it was a c you have been
better off from scratch 100% 100% so
anyway we we then I then grew that
company in two years by 223 locations
across the country three franchises who
bought 223 territories who became the
biggest drywall repair company in the

[07:01]
biggest drywall repair company in the
world and all those franchises opened
with jobs on the calendar and an
employee hired prig to training wow
that's awesome thank you it was took a
village we put teams in place like we
there were some things that I definitely
would have changed had I been in control
of the operations I was running the kind
of development side of things but with
the within the confines of what the what
we were given I think we did a really
good job what were the unit economics of
that business from the franchise or's
perspective what were your territory
fees did you give discount for multiple
territories what were your royalties so
they were the territories were I think
five but they finance the territory I
think 50% if I'm remembering correctly
it's like 50 or 60% would be financed so
like we could get someone in for three
territories with 45 Grand out of pocket
and then the rest would be financed
there's really no inventory or equipment
even for that business there are some

[08:00]
even for that business there are some
like sales businesses where it's a
painting business or something like that
and you just have a truck and you go
sell it was pretty similar in in time in
terms of you only bought the mud and the
putty it wasn't like high inventory so
it was good it was it was it was a good
business it wasn't like a you're going
to build a multi-million dollar
Enterprise business but like someone
leaving a corporate America job where
he's making 120 Grand a year and like
wanting to get up to that like
relatively quickly like we were able to
accomplish that yeah what does an
average repair or a patch cost and then
what are the margins look like on that
yeah so the Aver so it was either a half
day or full day job okay half day was
about 400 if it was a full day it'd be
about 800 so you basically be able to
make about $800 per technician per day
wow the average job size when I left was
like
442 and that's four hours of work so not
bad you're operating at about a 30%
margin after franchise fees on that
business wow so even if your kid put

[09:00]
business wow so even if your kid put
puts a hole in the door with the door
knob that's a half day job minimum yeah
there was a minimum so there'd be a
minimum and then that they'd go out
there and see that there's cracks in the
ceiling or see that there's okay is
there anything else because we have a
minimum is there anything else that you
you want there's always more stuff
they'd have stuff behind paintings that
their spouses did like it would get up
higher but yeah that's smart I like that
model and so you just you had a proven
like a Marketing System you knew that
you could generate leads paid ads or or
whatever they're buying into the
handholding the support the system and
you just said he follow this Playbook
and and you'll be good yeah exactly and
we were doing that all across the
country when I left we were signing up a
new franchisee and then we were training
a new we were training a new group of
franchisees and putting seven franchises
on the road every seven to eight weeks
wow and so we had it humming and we

[10:00]
wow and so we had it humming and we
basically became we became the biggest
drywall repair company in the world and
other companies tried to follow along
and there's now six or seven patch
franchises that have tried to ride the
wave so to finish your question the
company I was working for which they we
had grown them to 12 Brands so 4,700
locations 12 different brands in 55
countries and so we became the second
largest portfolio of service brands in
the world and they came to me and
they're like Aaron love what you did we
want to put you on like track for a
higher level role within the company
we're going to buy a business at the end
of the year it's not a franchise yet we
want you to franchise it we'll double
your salary we'll give you a really
fancy title and I was like wait a minute
I can do this on my own I could build a
team I could raise capital I could find
a business that I believe in and I could
franchise that business real quick when
you say do it on your own do you mean
buy a business and make it franchisable
or start a business from scratch and
make it franchisable

[11:00]
make it franchisable
so acquire the so there's two separate
businesses when you franchise there's
the franchise business and then there's
the actual Core Business those are two
separate businesses my plan was to start
a franchise or based upon a good
business so I didn't want to I didn't
want to go acquire a Restoration company
and now I'm a restoration professional
triangle a Restoration company I wanted
to say hey and that I've tweeted about
this but you have a good restoration
business or in my case you have a good
power washing business I want you to
keep running your business because it's
a good business and then I'm going to
create this other business which is the
franchise business and you're going to
have upside in that business I'll take
all the risk I'll raise all the capital
I'll build the team
and you get to keep doing what you've
done forever and so that's the way I did
it and so they keep doing what they're
doing which I imagine that enables you
to get a better price but then they do
get an upside in the franchise door side
of the business as well yeah so I I

[12:02]
of the business as well yeah so I I
didn't the way I structured the deal is
I didn't pay anything to them for the
bit like I'm acquiring the systems the
franchise rights the trademarks but the
business that doesn't have any real
value necessarily until we have
franchisees so they get to keep 100% of
their business the systems and the right
so yeah so I raised capital for that I
invested they actually also invested the
founders of rolling Suds I raised a
significant amount of capital so that I
could build the system the right way and
also put people on my cap table that I
could always bring more capital in just
from the people who are already there if
I needed it and I knew exactly when we'd
be profitable as an organization I knew
exactly how much money it was going to
cost to get us there because I modeled
out five six years of what a franchise
or looks like at a certain royalty rate

[13:01]
or looks like at a certain royalty rate
all that kind of stuff and so we
finalized I finalized the acquisition in
January of last year in 2023 we took the
brand to market end of February and then
I now have 28 employees I have turned
away 59 people who wanted to become
franchises had the capital and weren't
right for our system which is a little
over $10 million in Revenue that we've
turned down wow and then we have signed
up now 51 franchises who have purchased
187 territories in 26 States we've done
that in 15 months and on the personal
side I live in Nashville my wife and I
have been married almost five years we
have a three-year-old son and my
daughter is 18 months so if you didn't
think I was nuts after everything I just
told you how pregnant my wife was all
this time 2019 to 2021 were that was a
crazy time period for you then yeah 20
so

[14:00]
so
2022 oh 2019 to 202 so this yeah even to
2022 it's I guess it's just been a crazy
five years for you it's been nuts yeah
that's a great way yeah exactly it's
been nuts it's cool to see the effects
of compounding right like you were just
all of the 2010s you were just grinding
compounding slanging territories and
then 2019 you just saw an opening and
and then here you are 187 ter so three
to four territories per
franchisee yep we do minimum of two
because we're not looking for single
unit operators it's just a different
mindset in my experience and I'm only I
should clarify that everything that I'm
saying about franchising is from the
lens of my experience yeah and my
experience is different than a lot of
other people's and in my experience
single unit
franchisees fail more frequently they
have a different mindset they're like
let me stick one toe in and see side
hustle yeah great if I could make 80
grand a year yeah and that's just not

[15:01]
grand a year yeah and that's just not
that's not our buyer our buyer is the
entrepreneurship through acquisitioned I
want to build a multi-million dollar
Enterprise buyer that's our buyer so we
do a minimum of two and then the maximum
for most people is three territories to
start however we've brought in some
we've brought in folks who have had nine
figure exits we've brought in like the
largest fast science franchisee that
does 42 million a year like we brought
in some larger operators who have they
don't want to take any dollars out of
the business for like years or a decade
until they have 12 15 trucks on the road
so we've allowed those types of buyers
to buy more four fiveish territories six
maybe yeah because you got to find that
happy medium between someone that wants
to scale and someone that's not just
going to get crushed by scale correct
which that's hard to figure out I've
just done it long enough to where I have
a pretty good intuition and I did all of
those I think this is important for
anyone who's like listening and maybe

[16:00]
anyone who's like listening and maybe
does or doesn't understand franchising
like I did all the franchise sales
myself up until about five weeks ago so
all 51 of those franchises I
single-handedly walked through the
process and made sure that the right
expectations were aligned of like what
our responsibilities are what their
responsibilities are and and that was
really important to lay the groundwork
because candidly a lot of the
franchisees that have signed up are
similar in terms of like mindset and
goals to me
which is slightly crazy as as
entrepreneurs are yeah it's like I me
when I hire people I I tend to hire
people that are like me you know and
it's that's my tribe and that's normal
that's human nature diversity is good
but as you grow like you need like in
those early stages you need people that
are like you so you can grow and then
you get to a point where it's like all
right now you have to specialize and
either that person's going to work and
that in a specialized role because he's
been doing everything or sometimes
people just don't scale with the
business yeah and that happen s that I

[17:00]
business yeah and that happen s that I
say a company that's growing like this
if you've got employees that are just
like plateauing they're holding the
company back and fast growing company
outgrows people and there's no way
around that how much did you have to
raise to get the franchise zor off the
ground so I'll tell you I'll tell you
what I'm so a good franchise zor needs
in my opinion at minimum half a million
doll and
realistically closer to a million to2
million to actually properly
franchise a business and I should
provide some additional Clarity I'm able
to be profitable from franchise fees
because we do the franchise sales
inhouse I raised enough Capital to where
if we didn't sell franchises for X
period of time we'd be fine but I've
been profitable since April of last year
we've been able to take the capital that
franchisees give us and reinvest it into
infrastructure a lot of franchisors
Might Outsource their franchise sales to

[18:00]
Might Outsource their franchise sales to
franchise sales organizations or um and
and in those cases they could
potentially be losing money on franchise
sales because they pay the whole
franchise fee out to um the sales
organization so that would then mean
they need two to three or four million
do to do it and the reason is because
the way franchising works the business
model is we make money on
royalties but until the franchisee gets
launched and up been running and has
multiple trucks on the road and has
opened other locations like the
royalties aren't meaningful enough to
support the actual growth that it the
actual supports that's necessary on the
front end of the business because where
franchisees need the most help and
support is in those first six to 12
months now don't get me wrong they need
help and support through the entire life
franchise and my goal is to continue to
add value throughout that but if you
don't have the infrastructure rure to
support the growth which cost

[19:01]
support the growth which cost
money and you're not and you don't have
franchise fees to invest in that it's
going to be hard to get to where every
franchiser wants to get to which is
royalty self-sufficiency that is when
the royalties are paying for the that
just superar royalty self-sufficiency is
when royalties are paying for the
infrastructure to run the business and
everything else top is they need the
most support when they cost the most to
you and are providing the least it
sounds harsh but they're growing their
business and their royalties amount to
50 to 100 bucks a month and you're
investing 10x that into them correct and
that's the way it needs to be done and I
think that if more franchise or knew
that before they went in to being a
franchise or they might decide not to
franchise which honestly wouldn't be a
bad thing if we had less franchise ores
out there we'd have I think the
franchise industry in general would have
a better reputation because I don't
necessarily know that means that there's
a lot of like it's just a lack of

[20:01]
a lot of like it's just a lack of
Education they s they think they have a
good hot chicken business and it needs
to be a franchise and they don't know
anything about how to franchise a
business so it's like they're taking a
risk on a startup but there's all these
other franchisees that are also taking a
risk on them figuring out how to be a
franchise or it's crazy that there's so
many bad franchise ores out there when
it costs so much to become a franchise
or you know yeah and if you don't know
what you're doing it costs even more and
so if you don't have that Capital which
is what mostly the case is that's why
they can't be a good franchise or
because they didn't know going into it
that they needed a million or two
million dollars let's just keep it a
million to keep the numbers easy what
let's say four like what four buckets
would you put that million dollars in
what ises that there's gonna be like
legal and startup so getting all of the
franchise documents together the
operations
manual that could be

[21:00]
manual that could be
On The Low End 50 on the high end 150
and during that time you may and I'm
just talking about cash outlay I'm not
talking about the cost of time right so
that's a different that's a different
dollar amount because these people who
have a good business are now no longer
spending time on their business that's
returning them that's giving them a
return on their investment because
they're allocating their time elsewhere
so I want to be clear I'm not talking
about the cost of time I'm just talking
about cash outlay you need another
probably 200 to get to stand up a
franchise
sales either department or hire a
company to do it you're going to need an
operations team member at to start I
would not recommend bringing anyone in
for less than 100 Grand a year and
ideally if you don't have any experience
in
franchising it's higher than that like
150 plus cuz you need someone who can
operationalize a franchise or get units
open and get them profitable like it's a

[22:01]
open and get them profitable like it's a
different type of operations person than
just someone who's like a general
manager at a store and and then you've
got to assume that it's going to take
you let's just say six months minimum to
get a franchise sold and open so you
need to be able to support that whole
infrastructure of the business for those
six months at least and then you need to
know how many people do I need to get
that one unit open and then or get from
open to
profitable and what is that
infrastructure cost so all of that's
going to come out of that million and
the more units that you
sell the more people you need to support
and open the units which is going to
probably supersede that million if you
sell a ton of units right off the bat
then great but you're not going to see
any fruits from that for a year or two
and you have to have the support
necessary for them to actually speak
positively about their experience
yeah because they're gonna talk to the

[23:00]
yeah because they're gonna talk to the
other owners yeah if they're not right
like if people are that's the first
thing people want to do is let me talk
to franchisees and it's if they're not
getting the support they need or
whatever like you you struggle we I've
been directly or indirectly involved now
with 14 different residential and
Commercial service Brands and not one of
them has had 28 dedicated employees to
the brand like fully dedicated like 100%
of their time and we have 36 operating
franchisees right now we have 51 total
they'll all be open by July so we have
36 operating franchises and 28 humans to
support them at our home office it's
just the way we're building this is
different than anything else I've ever
seen before and that was a big reason
for me for doing it because I'd like to
help reset standards in the franchise
industry of no this is actually What It
Takes costs a lot of money you probably
shouldn't do it and if you do it this is

[24:01]
shouldn't do it and if you do it this is
the struggles you'll have and and that's
why I write about it all the time I
create content about it all the time
because I want to impact that in a
bigger way here's one question so I I
feel like a lot of franchises especially
the ones that grow really fast can
become victims of their own success and
the territory start cannibalizing each
other how do you prevent that and what
is like how many territories can the US
support for Rolling Subs so
realistically about 900
so we do a quar million people roughly
per territory which is larger than the
colleagues that I have in the space in
Home Services which are typically around
200 or they'll do it by like households
and it's just like a predominantly
residential business that might give
60,000 households to one person the
challenge that you get into in that
situation is if you give someone one
territory and then you sell all the
other units around them they can't grow
and so I was very intentional about

[25:01]
and so I was very intentional about
choosing the size of my territories and
then allowing people to buy multiple
territories to start so that they could
develop those territories and add trucks
within those
locations so I look at it from a
perspective of trucks versus territories
because a really aggressive operator
could have as many trucks as they want
within a 250,000 population area and our
model is not just residential power
washing it's commercial in fact the
majority of our business is commercial
so $20,000 parking garages and $4,000
courthouses that's our space the total
addressable Market when you factor in
commercial buildings is massive it's
huge so if someone comes in and buys
three territories which is the max that
your average person let's just call it
could buy they can still build a big
business within that and then what ends
up happening is in a good system
consolida happens typically faster and

[26:00]
consolida happens typically faster and
what I mean by consolidation is
franchises end up buying up other
franchises so you'll have mediocre
franchisees that perform and they're
happy and maybe they cash flow 200 Grand
on the business but they're like H I'll
just go I was making 20 grand salary I'm
gonna go work at a job again this is a
lot more work than I thought and the
franchisees next to them who now have
multiple trucks within their three
territories will buy those three
territories and so I'm I've prepared for
that in how I've built this under the
expectation that consolidation will
happen in my in my network faster than
others just due to the nature
of how sophisticated our operators are
we're already starting to see that
there's people who haven't opened yet
and they're going to training together
and they're like I'll buy your markets
for double what you pay them and I'll
pay you a quarter million dollars to run
the business for me like literally
they're just so eager yeah just like so
excited it's crazy so cool and you allow

[27:01]
excited it's crazy so cool and you allow
that right like 100% yeah yeah 100% I
want I want to help franchisees build
wealth that's why I'm doing this and so
if it's not right for someone that came
in because there's no way I can bat a
thousand there's absolutely no way like
not everyone's out for business and
that's like totally okay but if that
person who decides I want to go get a
job can get a return on their investment
even if they're just getting out for
similar to what they paid in and now
this other person can double their
potential output with double the amount
of territories all day long I'll do that
it's great what is the Persona
hindsights 2020 you sign a guy what is
the Persona of a someone that you sell a
territory to that just crushes it top
five perent top one what does that
person look like so one of the biggest
surprises for me at the beginning of
this was how heavy we were how heavy we
became so quickly on the commercial side
of the business so I went into this
under the expectation we'd be like 8020
residential commercial and In fairness
to me it was because it took our

[28:01]
to me it was because it took our
founding location 27 years to have any
real relevance in the commercial sign
they've gone in the last five years from
32% commercial to 56% commercial which
was last year by revenue or by number of
jobs by Revenue Okay so we've been 60 to
70% commercial in a lot of the markets
we've entered right out the gate month
one so a big part of the business
business is B2B we generate we generate
outbound commercial leads but you got to
be able to go out talk to the customer
develop the relationship and close the
deal it's a hard to close and yeah
they're calling because they need the
service or they're ask they requesting
information so it's still a warm lead
but there's still cold elements to it
too you got to go sit down with the guy
who has an $8 million painting business
and say hey you don't want to power wash
any of these buildings that you're clean
or that you're painting give them to me
it's is a very relationship oriented
business so someone who's comfortable

[29:00]
business so someone who's comfortable
being out in their Community shaking
hands kissing babies the person who
wants to be behind the scenes is going
to really struggle unless they have a
business partner or a spouse that can do
that role especially initially because
it's such a big part of the business it
the the way our model is you just start
stacking commercial estimates on stop of
each on top of each other every month
and then six months 12 months 18 months
later they start to drop and so you do
Residential which pays the bills you you
add trucks within those 6 to 18 months
and then when the commercial jobs start
to hit then you they're more profitable
because you have more trucks so from
like a a goals standpoint these are
people who want to build big businesses
if someone comes to me and they're like
I just want one maybe two territories
one truck G to try this out with my son
see how it goes he's just not our buyer
or she and people who align with our
core values our mission statement is
actually this is a relationship because
I believe that the relationships that we
have with our franchisees and that our
franchisees have with their customers

[30:00]
franchisees have with their customers
and employees will really help Define us
as an organization and then these are
people I I call them goalpost movers
it's a lot of the people most of our
franchisees have have come from SMB
Twitter they want to if they get to this
Benchmark then they're like that's cool
what's the next one or what's the next
one or who can I acquire to get to 20
million or how do I get to 100 million
or what other businesses do I need to
buy or what other brands Aon are you
going to launch cuz like those are the
types of people that have worked well in
our
organization it's funny because I just
tweeted about this an hour ago of
finding your white whale I don't know if
you saw that but I gave a keynote speech
on it last month and I I gave a speech
to these guys that are looking to
acquire like $500,000 HVAC businesses
right they're Searchers yeah and I just
told them like take 20% more risk feel
20% more uncomfortable and you can have
a 200% outsize outcome so what you're
telling me is like someone that's see
how goes like they're going to get what
they ask for it's just going to be okay

[31:01]
they ask for it's just going to be okay
and someone that wants to just conquer
the world they're going to get what they
ask for it'll become a self-filling
prophecy it'll be confirmation bias and
they'll they won't for sure accomplish
their goals but they're going to be much
more likely to accomplish their goals so
it's just it's funny hearing that
because it's I completely agree what are
they looking for right yeah yeah and
that's such a big piece of business's
attitude and risk tolerance I try to
stress to people who look into
franchising like it is not a get-rich
quick schem it is is not a passive
business like it's your it's when you
buy a franchise you are still starting a
business from scratch you have some more
tools than if you were to do it on your
own we provide help with marketing and
recruiting and training and systems and
we've done this for 34 years on the
power washing side and I've done this
for almost a decade on the franchise
side there is less risk but there's
still risk yeah and any franchise or
that tells you there's not or you can
just like phone it in kind of thing and
collect collect some money that's just
not that's not how it is like it's just
the same as any other business you're

[32:01]
the same as any other business you're
going to learn how it works our
franchises are not power washing we
don't that's not our like we talked
about earlier that's just not our buyer
they're going to hire a general manager
in training and a junior technician
prior to going to
training but it's still hard and you
need people who are understanding of
that and still willing to come in and
take a really big swing and if we all
know that it's going to be hard and
we're all working together to WS
marching in the same direction we can
grow a 1002 200$ 300 million plus
company yeah so you see a strong
correlation between people in sales
people that are extroverts people that
aren't afraid to get their hands dirty
even if like they're not going to be the
one power washing themselves those are
the people that are usually the most
successful yes people that are
extroverts for sure we do have
introverts as well it's not like sales
experience is necessary because we teach
that and it's not it's not like

[33:00]
that and it's not it's not like
pharmaceutical sales where you're trying
to get someone to switch from one
medication to the other like these
people have a dirty structure that they
either own or manage and it needs to be
cleaned and it's not as bad from a sales
perspective so it's what the main thing
we're looking for is grit are they gonna
are they going to do whatever it takes
and not let anything fail and had how
has that looked in the past based upon
the experiences that they've had thus
far and do we judge what the future
might look like based upon that and
we've been super selective yeah do you
see a correlation between former
business owners versus lifelong W2
owners and how successful they are it's
funny because you would think that it
would need to be business owners and
that would be the higher success rate
through entrepreneurs people who are
like me we're just going to start or
maybe like you like we're just going to
start something from scratch and it's
going to turn into this big thing
they'll actually they might struggle
more in a franchise system than a lot of

[34:01]
more in a franchise system than a lot of
push back just think about it they've
been rewarded for doing completely
operating outside the box yeah and they
have X number of dollars in the bank or
X number of net worth because of their
ability to do that yeah and while we
have operators like that we try to
remind them listen this is why you
brought us in this is why you we're
trying to skip all of those things and
it's not but let's focus on the that's
to provide the most Lage on The Bu
instead and let us everything about this
just varies on the type of buyer and how
they operate so someone who's really
good at here's the manual follow the
manual and like figures out the manual
or whatever it is or if they've been at
a job and they've just excelled and
continue to rise the ranks that person
will do really well in a franchise
system because it's just give me the
Playbook I'll just go do it and so that
yeah so that it varies though we've like

[35:00]
yeah so that it varies though we've like
I said we've got other people who have
exited businesses before we've got
people like we it's all over the board
yeah I have friends with a crumble
franchisee and he went to their training
and someone made a comment like yeah we
should try and they were just like we
don't want you to be creative yeah don't
be creative please you're gonna be a
robot and you will have the most success
just trust the process and that's hard
for a lot of people yeah that would be
really hard for me honestly it would be
hard me too it
would be hard for me but I'm like a true
entrepreneur I like to create things
from scratch conjure things up when you
buy a franchise you're buying proven
processes and systems and they're not
always going to be perfect but it's
going to be better like when you buy a
business or buy a like that's why
Searchers work really well in our that's
why a lot of our franchises have been
Searchers because they're like okay
there's this business it works which is
why I'm buying it which is why I'm
taking Tak on this loan and all I have
to do is just run the play and maybe add

[36:01]
to do is just run the play and maybe add
some value and that those a lot of those
people will say God I've been looking
for a business for 18 months and I
haven't found that perfect HVAC business
yet why don't I consider franchising
where I can pay
less come in get a similar return or get
a similar outcome for Less capital and
potentially less risk yeah even though
that's becoming more popular I still
feel like we haven't even scratched the
surface it's just they're so set in
their ways of buying something that they
just they Overlook franchising
completely completely and we're very
much scratching the surface of what the
possibilities are of Searchers and
considering franchise ownership and I
can't stress this enough though they
have to find the right brand it just has
to be the right thing because we've
talked about a couple experiences where
it clearly wasn't and that's sucked for
franchises in those

[37:00]
franchises in those
situations and but if you think about
the people who bought into like Orange
Theory Fitness they probably got seven
eight 12 Studios that are each spitting
out four to five million do or three to
five million do in Revenue like they're
good you know or like they're good like
they're fine or you think of the average
McDonald's owner as worth $22 million
like they wouldn't have achieved those
returns theoretically on their time and
capital without the right brand yeah so
it's really important to find the right
one when you talked in the beginning you
talked about how you disqualify a lot of
people more than maybe makes you feel
comfortable do you how often do you talk
to someone like me and you're just like
listen man like you've bought into power
washing clearly but I think you're just
better off doing this like just start
this from scratch because I feel like
there's going to be a lot of conflict
between us over the next couple years do
you ever have that conversation I get to
that situation because of my background
and because I have the capital not have

[38:01]
and because I have the capital not have
to worry about getting that franchise
fee which is a big piece of it by the
way if you if I didn't have that it'd be
a different mindset I gotta make payroll
which is another reason why franchise or
struggle but I will I have no problem
saying this isn't the right fit like you
not is it only that rolling studs isn't
the right fit for you I don't think you
should buy a franchise I think you
should go start something on the side
see how it works and the other thing
I'll say is a lot of people come to
franchising a lot of franchises or
perspective franchises come to
franchising and think I don't really
have to work because the franchisor will
just do it for me or they'll hire the
people or they'll generate the leads and
I don't have to do anything and that's
also not something that's true and the
but yeah I've told many people like this
isn't the right fit for you and it's
nothing it's not offensive by any means
it's just you need to go conjure
something up on your own a lot of the
time you're thinking man this guy's
going to crush it too like he's going to
crush
but it's just not the right fit for us
to crush it together it would longterm

[39:01]
to crush it together it would longterm
do more harm than good yeah it wouldn't
make sense for either of us it's not a
good return on on either of our times to
try to make this work it's just go go do
it like this franchise isn't the right
thing but the the people who are looking
and searching for a business I feel have
already recognized that they don't have
a new idea that they want to like start
from scratch or that they came up on
they're looking for something with
proven systems in place and they can go
buy that and yes there's risk associated
with a personally guaranteed loan or
whatever but they have it has cash flow
and the challenge is that there's more
Searchers right now than businesses for
sale like I think it's a considerable
difference I don't have the data to
support that but I'm pretty sure it's a
considerable difference based upon my
experience in talking to these folks and
how long it takes them to find this
business and if they could potentially
say all right instead of
the opportunity cost of spending 18 to

[40:00]
the opportunity cost of spending 18 to
24 months in due diligence and lawyer
fees and spending time researching
opportunities and not working during
that time if they found the right brand
and invested 24 months and all of the
capital they would have spent doing all
that due diligence on a franchise system
get that up promote people look at other
businesses at that point youve got a
cash flow business at that point I talk
to Searchers like yeah I've been at it
for 18 months and and I'm like what have
you been doing I like I could literally
and I'm not exag I've done this myself I
could scrape a bunch of businesses give
them a call shoot them a text and have
be discussing prices in within an hour
like there are tools out there like
publicly available literally within an
hour like all right it's 3x EA let's go
have breakfast tomorrow like what is
taking 18 months I don't understand it I
think by the time it hits the bis Buy
cell like or whatever plat form like
it's too late yeah you've got people

[41:00]
it's too late yeah you've got people
with way more resources that are
identifying these businesses before they
hit the market and so by the time it
hits bis by sell it's already being bid
on it's already there's probably already
a buyer and it's it's a seller's market
right now on business there's I still
think there are deals on bis byell like
we found one before they are harder
they're more pickr and the Brokers don't
even answer their phone but even forget
bis byell you just calling C business
owners like it's just a numbers game if
you talk to 100 there's going to be five
ready to sell and of those five there's
probably going to be a pretty good price
in there yeah and you've got I've got a
guy who does my pest like he comes here
every quarter he does the stuff and it's
just the expense I have every single
quarter I can't pay the bill and it's
not on autodraft I have to call in and
and tell him my card number over the
phone and we're wasting time
that be if I didn't have all the that'

[42:02]
that be if I didn't have all the that'
be a great place to start listen how
much are youing and what if I just gave
you three times that and then you put
like an app or like payment structure in
place like so there's creative ways to
do it but most of my franchises are
coming from the Twitter Searcher for a
lot of the reasons we're talking about
yeah in your system of all your
franchises how much is the best one
making like the highest performer so we
don't have franchisee performance yet in
our franchise disclosure document so I'm
limited as to what I can say publicly
just by the Federal Trade Commission we
our first franchisees launched in July
of last year so they just for people who
are listening to this you have to have
12 months of a franchisees performance
includ them in the franchise Disclosure
document and franchises are heavily
regulated for a good reason because
someone could just be like this is how
much money you're going to make and
there's no recourse what I will tell you
is we launched multiple franchises last

[43:03]
is we launched multiple franchises last
year and the majority of them ordered
another truck and expanded to another
truck within the first six to seven
months of
operation one of them did it in two
months we've got two franchises that
just launched last month they've already
placed their order for their second
truck so the model is working but in
terms of any like realistic data for
someone who's interested in becoming a
rolling Subs franchisee we don't have it
yet and that's a part of the reason why
it does take a special type of person to
buy into an emerging brand because
you're really buying into like me my
team right our vision for becoming the
biggest power washing company in the
world the culture we've built the goals
the FR franchisee number 150 is not the
same buyer profile as franchisee number
20 yeah it's just not now two three
years from now we'll have more data in
our franchise Disclosure document to
disclose but a lot of the territories

[44:00]
disclose but a lot of the territories
the main territories will be gone by
them yeah how much gross revenue do you
expect to get from a truck per
year yeah so I can give you that number
our our average gross revenue per truck
is
$422,000 as of last year we had a jump
from the year prior from 373,000 to
422,000 just due to increasing
efficiencies on that truck and more
commercial jobs than expected correct
and our our trucks and just our
equipment like a lot of people talk
about they're looking for a business
with a moat when I was analyzing
businesses there were two things on my
kind of checklist that were impossible
to find without with like with other
businesses I evaluated I looked at HVAC
and plumbing and solar like I I did the
whole kind of like search or Gambit and
the two things were were a difference in
product offering so something that is a
better product objectively than the rest
of the competitors and and so we power
wash stories from the ground with the
equipment that we have and we can do a

[45:00]
equipment that we have and we can do a
3,000 foot house in 20 to 25 minutes
start to finish set up tear down
everything that's a$ four to $500 job so
the economics is they're just they're
just incredible and we manufact we make
that equipment we build the trucks you
cannot buy that equipment we have a lock
on the manufacturer and the way we run
that equipment is the opposite of what
power washers are taught to do so really
we do have a moat and that that was
really interesting to me the other thing
that was really hard to find was little
to no competition in the franchise space
so in my experience in the franchise
industry there's typically a bunch of
local people that do the thing do the
service and then there's five to 10
other franchise brands that also do the
service but they have a different logo
and a different truck W and a different
name and whatever and they're all
coexisting in capturing market share
when I looked at power washing there
were local guys but there was no
National leader there was no serve pro

[46:01]
National leader there was no serve pro
no Styer no name very similar to 1800
got junk in the junk in in the like
early 2000s like there was no junk
leader they came in with a wrapped
vehicle and they showed up on time and
they built a billion dollar systemwide
sales company and paved the way for
college hunks Hing junk and Junk King
and junk luggers so anyways we're doing
to the power washing industry right now
what 1800 got Junk to the junk business
in the 90s and so we basically have a
truck that produces more revenue and
more profit than other power washing
trucks and we're the first
professionalized service offer uh
provider in the space so those were two
things I couldn't find in any of the
other businesses I evaluated yeah and it
is nice because there's some there's
going to be guys going and buying a $500
machine at Home Depot but you're not
really competing with them right there
is some barrier to entry by way of that
massive truck what do those trucks cost
about 150 Grand wow okay and then if

[47:01]
about 150 Grand wow okay and then if
I've got a truck that's doing 400 Grand
a year I'm looking at my second truck
how much of that could I expect to be
net
profit so you're operating once you have
multiple trucks right because there's
economies of scale at a 30 40% e margin
wow and we're basing this off of our
most recent franchise Disclosure
document which we released April and
it's based on our founding location so
they have four trucks that operate
full-time which full-time in the
Northeast is 205 days out of the year
which is where the founding location is
based and they're operating with that
scale at between a 30 to to 40% EA
margin and the thing that changes those
numbers is based upon the amount of
commercial work you're doing as a
business owner as a Fran Rollings
franchisees you're talking
$150,000 IA per truck once you have
three four or five trucks on the road
could a territory of 250,000 people
support four
trucks that is a wonderful question it

[48:01]
trucks that is a wonderful question it
depends on a ton of factors how many
commercial job don't have listen we've
got there's a recurring element to to
what we do that like we got a a lead for
one of our franchises because we turn on
Commercial leads a month before going to
training and it's 26 shopping centers
and they have to be cleaned every year
beautiful and that's a sixf fig contract
with a 3% renewal annually on a 2-year
contract that's one customer that has 26
shopping centers that same customer
manages other shopping centers yeah and
if he does a good job there he'll get
the rest of them and that that one
customer could theoretically become one
truck annually in terms of Revenue
performance yeah so I just don't have
enough people operating on my model in
enough markets right now to tell you
what the average is
and but it's not one yeah it when a lead

[49:02]
and but it's not one yeah it when a lead
comes in like that to corporate do you
charge the franchises to take that lead
or you're just taking the royalties and
they just so what the way we do it is we
have vendors that we've preapproved and
then we manage those vendors for
franchises and so we have six different
marketing agencies that generate leads
for
franchisees four of them are inbound
residential leads we have we have a call
center that's based in Utah and that
call center of course it is answers the
calls and books the
appointments and and then we have two
outbound lead generation companies that
do outbound reearch Outreach to property
managers facilities managers maintenance
companies and then they generate warm
leads and so we centralize all of that
in What's called the roolling suds lead
Center which where we track and
everything and then those companies Bill
L we build franchisees and then they
don't have to try to figure out where to
spend their ad dollars and if a vendor

[50:02]
spend their ad dollars and if a vendor
isn't doing well we can fire them we can
hold them accountable there's economies
of scale when we're doing that and they
don't have to sit there and say okay I
want to spend $800 this month on Google
ads instead of 700 or I'm G to spend
1,200 like we can just use data to drive
decision making so it's they build us we
build them kind of thing okay
so how much is it per territory 150 per
truck how many
what I'm GNA ask the zillion questions
you're not going to remember them all
what percentage of your customers are
are financing versus paying cash like
what is like an average ticket size to
to to get two territories and then what
are your royalty fees for two trucks and
two territories and working capital A
franchisees is going to need about 300
Grand okay you are not buying the C you
are not buying the truck so we have
financing options for the trucks okay so
basically the down payment on the truck
equipment wrap shipping being everything
to get the truck to them was about 35
Grand and territory is 549 and then we

[51:02]
Grand and territory is 549 and then we
do a minimum of two which would be half
a million people they're going to need
some working capital in there which
would be some additional startup
expenses so that gets them to the 300
number and that's going to basically get
them to their second truck within the
first six months because they have the
down payment for that second truck
included in that 300 and then our
development schedule is to add that
second truck six months in so they order
that four months in they have the truck
on the road six months in and two trucks
if operating at what our average day is
per truck is $80,000 a month if they're
operating 20 days a month at $2,000 per
day which is what our trucks do on
average per day based upon our franchise
disclosure our current franchise
Disclosure document so the goal is to
get
franchisees up to as much utilization as
possible on those trucks within the
first 12 months of operation now we've
got franchisees that are like we're GNA
have three or four trucks within the

[52:01]
have three or four trucks within the
first 12 to 16 months but that's our our
path that we're putting franchises on
each territory additionally would be
549 so because our kind of like maximum
for your average operator is about three
territories people are usually coming to
the table with about 360 and they need
to have a net worth of at least 900 I
personally don't think someone should
invest more than a third of their net
worth into a business I think it's just
too I think it just mentally doesn't
work yeah if you're investing half your
net worth or 90% of your net worth in a
business so we're really careful about
making sure that the people that we
bring in are a right for us but also B
have the kind of capital to to do this
the right way and the risk tolerance
associated with that we have not done
any SBA Loans the cost of capital right
now is like 11% and The Debt Service on
an SBA loan for our size business is
like 7 Grand month so it just makes it
just makes it a little bit challenging

[53:00]
just makes it a little bit challenging
to have Capital to then grow because
you're really not taking any kind of
things out of the business for a while
so we haven't done that we're not
entirely opposed to it but the person
would still have to have the capital to
support an SBA loan for to pay a year
anyways so it's like a a matter of what
you want how you want to use Capital um
yeah and then we've like I said we've
brought in some really high level
operators that have purchased five or
six territories and so it's just an
incremental 549 per territory from there
on from and what about your royalties or
like a marketing fee is there like a
percentage marketing fee yep so there's
an 8% royalty and by the way the numbers
that I gave the 30 to 40% that's iata
that's not gross margin and that's not
like before franchise fees yeah that is
those are numbers like after they've
paid these numbers I'm about to tell you
so 8% gross revenue goes towards the
royalty there's a 2% brand fund which

[54:00]
royalty there's a 2% brand fund which
goes towards National advertising we
don't really have a sizable enough
bucket there but once we're doing 100
million or 200 million in systemwide
sales we'll really be able to allocate
that Capital towards like National ads
and then they are required to spend a
minimum of $2,500 per truck per month on
local ad spend okay which is going to go
towards those six different marketing
vendors that we work with Okay we try to
shoot for 15 to 20ish per cost per
customer acquisition cost after a 12
months of performance and a Truck at Max
Capacity if working 20 days out of the
month is doing
$40,000 now a lot of our franchises Will
Work N they'll do weekends so that could
that number could change but if you
extrapolate out 2500 per truck to 40,000
it's still not going to get us to the
amount of money necessary from an ads
perspective so that's just a minimum so
we try to set expectation that
franchises will spend more than that and
yeah so awesome like I could probably

[55:02]
yeah so awesome like I could probably
talk for another hour I just geek out
over this stuff I've never bought a
franchise but I love the concept of
franchising both as a franchisor and as
a franchisee I think it's a brilliant
model and yeah I just love geeking out
over these numbers with you so thanks
