look at this freaking thing right here
did you know you can buy a 3D printer
for about 1,000 bucks that can print a
fully functional pair of Crocs here's
how I would take this idea and turn it
into a business making 10 grand plus a
month so first of all you can't print
Crocs directly in or you'll get sued six
ways past Sunday but here's what you can
do you can use chat GPT to give you
dozens of different designs that are
kind of like Crocs but not quite the
future of Commerce is one: one yes
people will always pay for Mass
manufacturing but we want something
bespoken to make a pair of sandals like
this would cost you between $5 and $15
in materials but you can use chat GPT
for all of these designs you can make
things that are hilarious or customized
to the person and the more custom you
get means that you can sell these for
whatever you want yes even hundreds of
dollars worst case you learn a lot about
3D printing and have some fun best case
you have a thriving business on your
hand
