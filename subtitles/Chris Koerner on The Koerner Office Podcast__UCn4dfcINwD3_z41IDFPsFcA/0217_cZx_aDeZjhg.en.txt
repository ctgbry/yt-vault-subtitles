look at this freaking guy right here
this guy makes $115,000 a month by
building custom garage shelves and
selling them exclusively on Facebook
Marketplace and I know exactly how you
can copy him I have all the details here
they are he was making five grand a
month while working a full-time job
borrowing his neighbor's truck and
delivering these on the weekend until
one day he said babe I'm going to quit
my job I think I could support myself he
did and he tripled his income he sells
these for
$770 he pays $200 in materials and all
he needs is a chopsaw from Home Depot
how do I know this because I just spent
an hour talking to him on my podcast
where does he get his other customers
where does he find materials for cheaper
how can he scale this how can people
copy him because guess what these things
are way too big to ship so anyone in any
little market could build these same
shelves at the same plan and sell them
for the same prices
