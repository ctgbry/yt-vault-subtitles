[00:00]
he ended up showing us a bank statement
that about knocked us out of our chair
$80,000 deposit on July 5th of coming in
on one day any stand that does 20 is
worth keeping pretend I'm not so busy
and I'm going to go do this is that
doable for someone like me or is it just
not the best and highest use of
someone's time he told me the number was
150,000 he's like if you go a dollar
lower I won't ever talk to you again it
can make in Revenue 100,000 a season if
you do it
[Music]
right well let's just get into it so
Daniel why don't you tell me who you are
and what you do and what business you
got on your hands there I'm a CPA and
kind operate two business Realms right
now so my main business is building a
remote CPA firm as I started building
that about two and a half years ago
about the same time I bought a firework
company which is really more of a side
hustle especially in Texas where it's
only legal to sell you know a couple
days a year and maintain my W2 job until
about two months ago so uh

[01:00]
about two months ago so uh
really built those businesses kind of
side by side but emphasize fireworks
more for the first two years of it last
six months have been emphasizing more of
the CPA firm just do the scalability and
then also having a business partner and
you know juggling the balance of
aligning our Visions while also wanting
to do what I want to do and build what I
want to build so you have a partner on
the fireworks business the CPA business
or both no fireworks only so yeah
fireworks I have a 50 50-50 partner um
silent partner he you know he doesn't
publicly share what that we do it just
because we you know want to keep it
private for him so yeah with 5050 on
fireworks but uh CPA wise 100% me okay
so tell me about this business where did
you see it for sale what did you pay for
it what was your thought process on
buying this I had a client at a CPA firm
I worked at right so I I had positioned
myself at that firm to be the guy who
was taking the new client calls and what

[02:00]
was taking the new client calls and what
that did and I highly recommend this for
young entrepreneurs is get yourself in a
position to do something beyond what
they try to cram you into a corner and
do right you know as an accountant
they're going to try to get you to
prepare as many tax returns as possible
or if you're on the audit side they're
going to try to get you to cram as many
numbers as possible I got myself in a
position where I could take the phone
calls and one of the clients was calling
about a different business but he said
hey you know yeah I'm a businessman you
know I have this firework company that I
run as well I'm like oh really like
what's that like well it's just two
little fireworks stands nothing crazy
you know I'm looking to sell it you want
to buy it he said jokingly right yeah
you're like maybe yeah that convers it's
one of those moments where I remember
driving home and I was just jazzed I was
so excited I was like man like that
would be so cool but it you know it just
wasn't going to come to fruition at that
time this is like middle of the pandemic
we had just had a third kid like we had
no money like there was no way of this
is going to happen and it would have

[03:01]
is going to happen and it would have
been a conflict of interest I was like
really loyal to my boss at that time and
like if I even indicated I wanted to do
something else I feel like it would have
like cut off the good opportunity I had
anyways I ended up leaving that company
and then after the following tax seon I
was at a new company I was like man I I
want to do something more and I
remembered the guy's email and I sent
him an email and he responded the same
day and turned into buying a firework
company what did your email say yeah so
I was like hey Mr firework you probably
don't remember me but I did some tax
work for you at this other company you
had mentioned wanting to sell your
firework business is there any chance in
heck you're still interested in that and
could I meet you up sometime to talk
about it and we had lunch two days later
how much time had elapsed between those
two
conversations a whole year had elapsed
from when I originally started doing
some stuff for him and when I reached
out to him again but then two days from
hey any chance you want to talk about

[04:00]
hey any chance you want to talk about
this to sitting down and having a lunch
meeting about it okay and then how did
the lunch go yeah so we we met at this
place I'm in San Antonio and so up on
the North side of San Antonio it's a
place called called grumpy Mexican food
this place is not Mexican food like it
is but it isn't it's so TexMex right
yeah yeah it's bad it's bad food yeah
and they sell like breakfast stuff but
it's like a niche little restaurant this
little town and that became the
headquarters of where we had all these
meetings like I always say I bought a
firework company in a Mexican restaurant
The Lunch went well my thought was that
he was gonna want like some number that
was just going to like be so big that it
you know it just wouldn't go anywhere
right I was thinking like 300 400,000
like I knew nothing about buying a
business but just in my head it was like
yeah it's going to be some big number
and there's just nothing I can do but in
that conversation he told me the number
was
150,000 he was just that's what I want
he's like if you go a dollar lower I
want talk to you again he's like this is

[05:01]
want talk to you again he's like this is
non-negotiable I know it's worth more
than this but that's my number he's like
I had one guy come in and try to lowball
me I don't want to deal with that again
I'm not going through that again 150,000
or it's no deal that's actually quite
refreshing like that takes a lot of
pressure off of you yeah right yeah it's
kind of like buying a car and you know
exactly what you need to shoot for yeah
the question you don't to worry about
that other stuff you could just focus on
structure right and wasn't worth it was
you know I had no idea how to gauge that
at that point like don't get me wrong
I'm a CPA like I've done taxes I've seen
a lot of profit and losses like I had
some idea of what it meant but like I
had never you know up to that point I'd
watched Shark Tank that was like my
education on what a multiple so no
entrepreneurship experience right yeah
at that point wow I had a little bit in
college I used to buy and sell iPhones
that was like my okay that was like my
first Venture like that got me through
school that I went to to BYU and out in

[06:02]
school that I went to to BYU and out in
Provo there's oh nice and uh out in Utah
there's a company called KSL right like
a Craigslist type company you can buy
and sell things that's what everyone
uses there's no Craigslist in Utah it's
all KSL yeah and I I bought a phone and
then sold it it took like three weeks I
made like 15 bucks I'm like yeah there's
not a business there I tried one more
time and that one I bought the phone but
before I had ever purchased the phone I
had already sold the phone smart like 50
bucks on it and that was a lot for a
young college kid with a wife and one
kid who was making like 12 bucks an hour
and so that set off a fire that's one of
my that's one of my mantras sell it
before you have it yeah yep so that was
it though I'd never acquired anything
for
sure so when he said that offand you
want to buy a business like you weren't
even really looking right then it's just
something triggered in you you know I
loved firework as a kid fireworks as a
kid uh I grew in Indiana and you know

[07:01]
kid uh I grew in Indiana and you know
every every state has weird firework
laws well when I was like eight a
governor of Indiana his name is Mitch
Daniels he's like the president of
Purdue University know so random person
might know who he is he's a fairly
popular politician but one of the things
he did to legalize fireworks right and
as a kid that was like my first
political thing like that's the first
thing I cared about like this guy was
legalized fireworks and I was like Mom
and Dad you got to vote for this guy
yeah and so he legalized them and we
went to a fireworks store the first time
they open and we went on like July 5th
and it was buy one get three free right
bottle rocket we shot those bottle
rockets all summer though we bought over
a thousand bottle rockets and we just we
fired them all summer me and my brothers
I had the time of my life so I had these
fond memories of
fireworks and I don't know when he said
hey do you want to buy a firework and
some of it was the numbers too right
like oh you can only be open the way he
made it sounds like oh you know you're
open a weekend and you make like you
know tens of thousands of dollars it was

[08:00]
know tens of thousands of dollars it was
like what like it's a lot of money okay
so let's while we're talking numbers
let's talk numbers he wanted 150 Grand
what were the revenues and profits yeah
yeah so he won 150 Grand and I said okay
you know I want to check your profit and
loss and he was like yeah I don't keep
books I was like okay is this like a
boomer like your typical yeah Texas
Boomer yeah yeah real real nice guy but
and an entrepreneur at heart you know
like 65 and still working like 50 hours
a week not because anybody told him to
but because he loves it that was it for
that meeting he just said he said look
you know it makes it it can make in
Revenue about 100,000 a season if you do
it right two seasons right so 200,000
Revenue was kind of like what he said it
could make he's like this last year it
actually did better he's like but we
we'll call it 200,000 in revenue and
that was all I had to go off of and
pretty split 5050 between new years's
and yeah yeah July he said New Year's

[09:01]
and yeah yeah July he said New Year's
was better which blew my mind I I I had
never I had seen one or two like big New
Year's things and in San Antonio New
Year's is a big firework season
everybody shoots it off at midnight it's
real cool if you're ever well because
it's not a thousand degrees exactly yeah
but he said New Year's was better I
thought that was weird it's turned out
to be fairly true after that I had to
kind of figure out how to come up with
the money right but I still hadn't seen
any any numbers or done any due
diligence but he ended up showing us a
bank statement that about kn out of our
chair once and this is once I had a
partner you know he showed a he showed a
bank statement with a $80,000 deposit on
July 5th of whatever year geez just
$80,000 coming in on one day and we were
like okay yeah that that's proof that's
proof enough for us he's like you got to
trust me the rest is cash I don't keep
track of it but you just got to trust
that the rest is Cash we were you know
that's interesting because the best
deals I've ever done involved some trust
there it's just like you know what this
could be the deal of a lifetime but it

[10:01]
could be the deal of a lifetime but it
there's some hair on it and you just got
to you got to swallow the hair or or
you're just going to deal with a
mediocre deal your spot on it there's a
lot of good businesses out there like
that too the issue is you always got to
figure out is the business the owner or
is the business the business right yeah
because you don't want to go buy a a
service-based business like that and
then it turns out the person is all the
relationships and he you you know he
sells you to the company but then
everybody's still calling him to come
out and repair their roof or whatever it
is now what time of year are you having
these conversations this was April it
was right after tax SE in 2022 okay so
you couldn't be any further away from
either holiday so you can't like you
know observe how it goes on July 4th you
kind of just gota that was the key keep
going so he he tells me in that first
conversation he's like he he he then
drive I follow him over he takes me over
to where he stores everything right you
can't store in a warehouse you have to

[11:00]
can't store in a warehouse you have to
store them and shipping
containers he shows me the operation he
says look this is the type of business
where once you know it you know it and
I'm not going to tell you anything else
unless you're showing me money by May 1
so this was April
18th and he wanted an answer with some
money behind it by May 1 I knew the
asking price was 150 I had a grand total
saved of
$0 and so the question became how the
heck am I going to come up with 150,000
in 12
days now I may have missed this but
remind me again what the profit was 200
Grand Revenue yeah so he and he didn't
have a good profit and loss but he he
basically said it's it's like a 50%
margin is what he claimed gez he claimed
1.5x multiple yeah he claimed so he
claimed that you know if if you make
100,000 in a season he's like you'll
take home about 50 of that now is that
you work in the booth that's the with
you working working the booth yeah

[12:02]
you working working the booth yeah
working there were two of them right so
working one of them there were two
stands so hindsight's 2020 in this
conversation because he wasn't wrong
about what the main stand right his main
stand and we still on the main stand and
that that is our best performer we've
grown it from two to five and what we
found is that to replicate what he does
at that main one and what we now do at
that main one is going to take five plus
years at each
location so the margin is that good at
that stand but not that good once you
create a new location you can't just
like copy and paste it you just gota you
gota people have to be familiar with you
and it takes time that main location
just has the perfect storm surrounding
it it's close to a couple of the really
big
companies it's right off of a main
Highway anywhere you go in San Antonio
if want to recreate that there's already

[13:01]
if want to recreate that there's already
a bunch of other people there he just
happened to be he he got there 10 years
ago before anybody else got there okay
is this the one by the coffe coffee shop
yeah yep okay I'm just I want to look at
it on Google Maps yeah yeah the one by
the coffee
shop North of San Antonio you got a huge
neighborhood across the street you got
like a substation right next door all
right so it's like is it a four or six
Lane Highway uh four lane Highway and
then who owns the land we rent from a
guy who rents from the owner so it's a
sublease from a suer and okay yeah so
but as far as we know it's just a some
family you know who's had the land for
years and worth a lot of money and then
what do you pay for that yeah so
fireworks stands are interesting because
you really don't pay monthly we just set
a price with each of our landlords I'm
not going to say it the only reason I'm
not going to say it is is that you know
if a landlord to go to find the podcast

[14:00]
if a landlord to go to find the podcast
I I'd hate for us to want to go get a
new location when you do a new location
you got to start low we pay premium for
that one but like a new location like
the minimum is usually about 2,000 a
season okay yeah so it's not like a
percentage of sales at least right and
somebody might want that and if it was a
good enough location you know I mean
we're usually pretty open to anything
but we've usually just settled on like a
a standard number like all right we'll
pay you this per season we try to
negotiate the pay after the season just
because it's you know we only make
Revenue twice a year a couple of the
landlords have been pretty okay with
that other ones have been like yeah no
way and and that's fine you know you
just kind of have to factor that into
saving up from the prior season could
you not speed up the process of like
making a really profitable location by
just like really investing time and
money into finding the best intersection
or location possible you probably but
the the zoning laws for fireworks are
that was my next question
yeah you can only put a firework stand

[15:01]
yeah you can only put a firework stand
they can't be inside any any city limit
inside of Texas so any incorporate city
limit you can't be inside so you can
only be in the county and unincorporated
areas Texas has very aggressive zoning
laws though right so San Antonio is one
of the largest cities just by land mass
like in the United States it's just a
massive City and when you compare the
city of San Antonio to to to the county
it's in it's like 98% of the county you
have to find the spots and then it's
just a matter of find the rent that
someone who will rent it to you and then
a lot of people don't want them their
year round our main one we're able to
keep their year round but most of them
we have to pay somebody to bring it in
and bring it out and that's usually
about 1,500 a season to to move a stand
in and out okay so two grand per season
like I know that's like a minimum it's a
range but it's a it's a single- digit
percentage of your Revenue but it's hard
to find locations they can't be in the
city limits ideally you're able to leave
it there year round but usually not do

[16:00]
it there year round but usually not do
do you leave the like how many fireworks
are left over I know they don't really
expire right you do you leave them there
on site or somewhere else no so they
have they have like a fiveyear shelf
life which is great we usually store
them offsite though because theft is a
huge thing in in the firework business
so you really don't want to leave any
fireworks at your locations and so we
don't leave any at our locations we sore
got a hide them then yeah yeah yeah yeah
because you can't put it in a storage
unit it's got to be in a shipping
container but it can't be obvious
unmarked shipping container somewhere
yeah yep and that's exactly what we do
okay so you learned pretty quickly that
one location was just amazing it's kind
of the 8020 rule right and the other one
was just new and small so we bought the
business from the guy right with the one
location for certain and then this the
second location he ran it that season
right so he brings us in July that was
the deal pay me a down payment watch me
run the business and then I'll teach you
everything from there MH and then pay me

[17:00]
everything from there MH and then pay me
the rest of it at the end of that season
and you get nothing from this first
season he had us at a location and it he
he was like up front he's like it didn't
do well and and the summer of 2022 was a
really bad drought so overall he just
didn't do well that season so like we
were pretty concerned right he did like
30% Less in sales than he had showed us
and it was like he he he like gave us an
out he's like hey if you want I can give
you money back I'm regretting even
wanting to get out of it we're like no
we want to stick with it December comes
along right and we think we're going to
have these two locations and we get in
contact with where we're going to go
back to and the guy was like oh hey I
don't want you guys back like wait what
do you mean he's like wait back up real
quick so you ended up buying it after
July then like officially yeah so we
made a down payment before July and then
and then made the second payment in like
August and then that's when CH and
everything gave us the keys and you
brought in a partner to help fund it
because I imagine it's cash only brought
in a partner to fund it and then and
then made us seller's note with the
seller oh nice okay so he he took some

[18:02]
seller oh nice okay so he he took some
seller financing but yeah I brought on a
partner for me to personally get the
money I had to do a bunch of Hocus Pocus
you know second mortgage lending getting
some money from friends and family it
was it was a stretch but I made it work
real quick I'll just say I not
understanding anything about margins I'm
really glad I didn't know then what I
know now because what I know now I might
not have I might have got too scared you
know there was too much risk but the
obliviousness and the
naivity has really profited me
super ignorance is bliss it I heard you
say about with the ATM the on the ATM
guys podcast episode you know he's like
the margins ended up being better than
they thought thankfully and there's some
truth to that interesting yeah sometimes
it goes the other way you know a lot of
times it's worse in fact usually it's it
ends up being not as good as you
forecast but sometimes it's the opposite
okay so you you you scramble all this

[19:00]
okay so you you you scramble all this
money together you close in August and
then you just sit on your hands I assume
until December yeah and at that point it
was just you know a lot of the little
things we we switched you know we he saw
inventory left over so we had to count
all the inventory to pay him for that
right he just gave it to us at cost you
know yeah and then just getting used to
things we had to do maintenance he had
some deferred maintenance he hadn't done
but yeah we we thought we were gonna
have the one that was always where it
was at and then we thought we were just
gonna
and he had even offered hey I'll move it
back to the other location for you for
one season and like we hadn't even had
the fathom like how do you move these
things they're 10,000 pound metal boxes
right like he had done all of that he
had a truck that he didn't himself right
so December like 14th rolls around right
like 10 days before the season and we're
like Hey we're going to go to that spot
and he's like yeah let me just call the
owner and he didn't call him and so the
next day I'm like you know I'm just
going to call this owner guy call him
I'm like hey I'm the firework guy yeah

[20:00]
I'm like hey I'm the firework guy yeah
we're just making sure we can move in
next weekend he's like no I I don't want
you
back what do you mean you don't this was
the more or the less profitable location
the less profitable one okay okay which
was a brand new location the summer of
2022 anyways long story short we we
don't get that location luckily the old
owner comes through he has another spot
he had once had he makes a deal with the
guy and we get into that spot but it was
like a onetime thing well what was his
reasoning why didn't he want you it was
on the property of a restaurant and he
said he felt like uh the local people
didn't like it there and we had seen
some chatter in the fa in a Facebook
group where they're like why do they
have that ugly fireworks stand there
this is a small community keep it quiet
I think he didn't want it to tarnish his
brand I totally get that like I have a
shop like a small warehouse and I said
no to 60 perspective tenants cuz it's
like no I don't want any signage I don't
want any customers like I was so so
picky it took me like 6 months which is

[21:01]
picky it took me like 6 months which is
you know tens of thousands of missed
rents cuz like I just didn't want to
mess with it you know the reputation and
just looked I didn't want it to look bad
so I get that in total respect for him
and I'm really glad it didn't work out
because it it forced us by by January
you know January 3rd
2023 you know we're six months in this
thing we now have to find a new location
before July and at that point we had
fully paid off the other guy like we're
separated from him we're on our own we
got to figure out how to move these
things so then we then we really got
into the business mode we we stopped
holding our hand and we had to just go
in and figure out everything okay so the
backup place that you got how do you
think it did compared to how the old
place would have done a little bit
better but not much better okay and we
could only be there for 3 days so we had
to move it in like December 28th and be
gone by January 1st it was like
whereas the other one we could have been

[22:00]
whereas the other one we could have been
there for two weeks so it might have
done a little bit better but it was a
decent location and he had been there
before so people knew there had been a
fireworks stand there so okay overall
that one did okay that season we were we
were happy with how it did but it was
just for one season one season and we
tried to go back later and the guy said
absolutely not we now are about a half a
mile from there we have a location and
we kept the same color stand so people
know it's us and but our first season at
the new one was our worst that was our
worst location this last season so wow
what what do you think made it so bad
when you're there for the first time it
you're you're hit or miss on on if
people are going to be receptive to you
right fireworks is like it's not like
any other business you know people don't
even really like they might Google
fireworks near me but because you pass
these places and there you know the big
indoor stores are so visible year round
most people just to go there when you
put in a popup stand you're kind of

[23:01]
put in a popup stand you're kind of
betting on the fact that people are
going to come try you maybe they know
you have better prices the the big guys
charge a lot money yeah it's kind of
like the boy who cried wolf in a way
because people drive by you for 359 days
a year and you're not open out of sight
out of mind and then their brain is
supposed to flip over to oh I need to
buy from this person yeah just it
doesn't compute yeah you you're your
spot on and I mean
I have people who drive past my
fireworks stand every day like they go
to the coffee shop and I'll be like yeah
I own the fireworks stand behind the
coffee shop and they're like oh that's a
fireworks SC it's like yeah oh I guess I
don't buy fireworks so I didn't even
realize yeah they don't even see it and
it's right there okay so then you went
to a new location and it just totally
bombed and are you thinking like we got
to move again or so this is the
interesting piece and sorry maybe there
was a little confusion there right so
January 2023 we we had done the onetime

[24:00]
January 2023 we we had done the onetime
location we now had to go find our own
location so the place that's like a half
mile from there was actually this last
season right that's when we have five
locations we go
to a place down the road from the one
that we had been kicked out of but it
it's a popular place where there's a big
bar and people are there all the time on
the weekends right it's just like in
Texas is really popular you know it's
always hot here they'll there's these
big bars that have these big out areas
and they'll have like many concerts
there all right if you are watching this

different content than my podcast and
YouTube newsletter. chrisj cerner.com
You'll see the link and we'll see you
there and we contact that owner and we
say hey we think we could be a good
firework stand location there it takes

[25:02]
firework stand location there it takes
five months negotiations and we finally
they finally said yes we had us there
and that one did pretty good what is
good like 40 Grand any stand that does
20 is worth keeping right 20 20 is kind
of like the
Baseline yeah you know if you can do 20
at a spot it's worth investing in the
spot this one did like double that and
so it was like okay but see at that
point we only I guess I said 40 I said
40 I was right nice at this point we
have two stands and one of them is doing
much more than 40 right that one just
does Bonkers and then we have one that
does 40 and it's like wow okay you know
we can repeat this and that's where we
run into our competitor when we're
returning our U-Hauls that we use to to
haul stuff we run into our competitor we
see him we go up and shake hands with
him we had heard of this guy he had
originally been a partner or worked with

[26:00]
originally been a partner or worked with
the guy we had bought our business from
we had heard a lot about it and we go up
shake hands and he says hey I'm ready to
get out of this business do you guys
want to talk about buying what I have we
said
abely like sorry but why like this to me
I'm sold I love the business I don't
care that it's seasonal why does he want
to get out of it like can't you like eat
crap for seven days a year yeah so the
issue is it goes back
to a $20,000 location one that can do
that is okay but you know just imagine
TW you know 20,000 right that's your
Revenue your product cost let's just say
is a third of that a third of the 20,000
okay so what 6,000 right so 2,000 for
rent so you're down to 18,000 6,000 for
the product all right so you're down to
12,000 your labor four grand all right
so you're down to 8,000 it's 1,500 to
move them in all right you're down to
6,000 ,500 you got to buy a U-Haul to

[27:00]
6,000 ,500 you got to buy a U-Haul to
move everything around all right you're
down 500 you're down to like four to
6,000 bucks that you make on a location
because it's you're not to scale you
need good
locations yeah and if all you're making
is that then it's just not good and his
locations used to do well there was this
Boom for fireworks during the pandemic
because everybody wanted them and he had
seen the boom and after the boom was
over it just wasn't as good and he had
started another business and he was like
hey I'm ready to get out I want to focus
on my other business I get that his
locations it started doing badly and it
reflected the fact that he had started
putting less time into
it so this was a competitor and how many
so you had two still you started with
two how many did he have he had two
operating but he had an additional stand
that he just didn't use okay so he had
three but even then it was like one and
a half operating because he he was
really only doing the work at one of

[28:00]
really only doing the work at one of
them and he had just leased the other
one out to some other firework stand
owner gotcha this at this point we're at
July of
2023 okay and he we say he how did your
season go and we had just done 40 at our
brand new location and he had done like
20 at his and he was like I'm done yeah
and then he had just let somebody else
run on the other spot for like a
thousand bucks so he he just wasn't
making the money and so we come in we
buy all three of his he has the two
locations we say we're going to run on
that other location and this is where we
learned that the business is more
difficult to scale than it really was
because the the main one we thought oh
if he did 20 we can do 30 we only did
like 23 he had just leased somebody else
that one did only did like 8,000 it
bombed we lost money on it but once
again we when we just put our minds
together and we me and my partner we're
really good at finding locations when we
put it on we that third one that he
wasn't using as all on its own location

[29:01]
wasn't using as all on its own location
and that one did really well what did it
do about 30 okay first season and we're
talking this was January
2024 basically correct yep okay and what
did you pay for these for the business
for the three locations yeah we paid
around a hundred
grand okay which was a good deal because
we needed to grow we wanted to grow it
wasn't as worth it as the first
acquisition was yeah still a good deal
not a great deal but you want to scale
and I kind of look at this a lot like
the vending industry where it's like
you're also paying for a location takes
time and money to find a location yep
okay so you've had one season with five
locations or you did and now you've you
just had your second yeah so how did
that go so so July
2024 right so three or four months ago
we get rid of the one that only did like

[30:00]
we get rid of the one that only did like
eight we just move out of there
completely and there's a whole story for
that I could tell you great story about
that the owner of the land put his own
fireworks stand right next to ours
that's why I did so
bad just because the lease was probably
like one page and didn't protect you
against that oh yeah none of these guys
are good at keeping leases we we've had
to overhaul the leases what did that one
do when he was right next you did you
leave it there that was the one that
only did
8,000 yeah I mean what did it do the the
season before before we don't know cuz
he that's where he had just leased it
out some okay yeah how did that
conversation go when you you roll up one
day and you see another one right next
door yeah you you'll love this so we
bought the we bought the the second but
like we acquired our competitor about
August 2023 right so 14 months ago on
like October 5th we get a call this is
from the guy we had been acquiring it
from and he says
hey look I feel real crappy about this
but I'm just going to tell you how it is

[31:00]
but I'm just going to tell you how it is
the guy at that one location he's
putting his own fireworks stand on there
he says that the lease is no on void
because I moved off turns out I can't
even find a copy of it and I'm sorry
he's just like look I'm sorry like if if
this is a deal breaker guys I'm sorry
like I I can give you your money back
like he he was genuinely remorseful but
we were like you know what
like crap happens like if we're going to
be business people you know like crap's
going to happen and we're just gon to
have to learn to deal with it and so
he's like if you want to make a deal
with him he's willing to offer you one
season to see how it
works you but you have to show up
tomorrow with
$3,000 like tomorrow he's like he's
giving you till tomorrow I don't
understand 3,000 this is like the land
owner that's about to compete with you
he wants 3,000 yeah to for to go away or
what no he wants 3,000 for us to be able
to be there for that
season otherwise we're going to lose
season location that that that that guy
had been operating on for five plus

[32:00]
had been operating on for five plus
years so he wants $3,000 and he's gonna
compete with you no matter what yeah now
the caveat there is is that he said he
was going to compete but he he's one of
those guys who's kind of all talk like
he didn't have a stand he hadn't bought
his license he hadn't done anything to
that point and we're in mid
October so we thought maybe it was all
talk so we went over made a deal with
him we told him exact we we forced him
though we like we want be exactly where
we've been you can't be you need to be
at least 20t from us we we got some of
the things we wanted from it enough to
say you know what like let's just let's
just do this and yeah we we had to show
up the next day with three grand and do
the deal it was do the deal now or don't
get off my property yeah and in
retrospect you would have not done the
deal yeah sure I mean in retrospect like
knowing what I know now yeah I would no
I would never I would never be on the
same proper property is another stand
again but with the time constraints we

[33:03]
again but with the time constraints we
had it's it takes a long time to find a
good location like people don't just hey
I'm going to bring my fireworks stand
over and shake hands with you like we've
found it takes an average of like four
to six months to just do a deal like you
have to approach someone they got to
think about it you got to explain it to
them back and forth and back and forth
and back and forth till they finally
agree and you write them a check or give
them cash see it's this is tough it's
tough because it's like I like making
asymmetric bets right where I can like
invest $10 and get a hundred or or lose
all 10 that's asymmetric right yeah this
is like an asymmetric bet for the
landlord in the wrong direction like
downside versus upside his downside is
you know and like this probably isn't
realistic but if they don't know the
fireworks industry they're thinking this
thing could explode I could get sued
he's thinking that's the downside and
his upside is two grand three grand like

[34:00]
his upside is two grand three grand like
it doesn't make sense so is there
anything you could do to align your
incentives better be like listen this
thing can make a 100 Grand I'm Gonna
Give You 10% of that my success is your
success is that a thing honestly it
could be it would it would be contingent
on on having a location where somebody
wants your your thing on their property
year
round and we've found the best locations
that's just very difficult so one of the
new ones we found it
we it's on the property year round and
it's great and it's a good location
but the reason they let it be on on a
year round is they're not doing anything
with that land it just happens to be at
an intersection where the owner of it is
a a company that might build a
restaurant there someday any stuff off a
main Highway there's already so much
demand there they really don't there's
just not a lot of room that they want to
bring a fireworks in and put
you know real estate everyone wants the
highest and best use this is like the

[35:01]
highest and best use this is like the
lowest and worst use yeah yeah yeah okay
so how much does a license cost and you
need one per location yeah you buy you
buy one per location surprisingly
licensing is not not bad you're getting
a state license and then you're getting
a a County license so it's only a couple
hundred bucks per location is there any
other red tape other than just zoning
ton of it any other place right like you
could most other states you can do a
popup tent right if you ever go to get
fireworks in most States you know around
Fourth of July there's tents out inside
Walmart parking lots Kroger parking lots
malls there's always places in Texas you
can only sell out of a enclosed
container preferably a shipping
container if not you have to build it
out of like a certain material it has to
fit all these things the barrier to
entry is tough you have to have certain
electric cool and then and then it's
County based right so like one Count's
Fire Marshal will

[36:00]
Fire Marshal will
have one set of rules or at least he
only enforces three rules but then we
have one County where the fire marshal
is like enforcing like all 25 of the
states guidelines and like if you don't
have everything to a te they shut you
down what are like the most difficult
things to adhere
to Ju Just that that the fact that you
have to operate out of the container
right and then moving the containers
it's just it's just not an easy business
to like dive into right yeah you know I
mean how how many people do you know who
who can pick up a shipping container and
move
it I've had it done before I've got I've
got some stories about that man yeah oh
geez I I could tell you shipping
container stories but yeah I I agree you
don't have power there on site do you or
do you you gota you gotta do it from a
generator and then you don't have
bathrooms on site for your people so you
you know do you get a porter potty or do
they go go to the coffee shop yeah the
coffee shop doesn't have a bathroom
oh wow oh it's just like a driveth
through drive-through only place okay

[37:02]
through drive-through only place okay
yeah so this last season was the best
one we've had so far just overall
operational wise we've we've got it
where we have managers running each
stand we found a good fifth location so
now we have five solid locations two of
them are year round the other three were
moving in and moving out but now we have
a a season under our belt at each one of
them this will be the first season where
we have all five locations not a single
one of them new and at at this point
we're just we're both really enjoying
just wanting to build it the way it is
we we don't really see ourselves wanting
to grow anymore because I'm very focused
on building my CPA firm uh my business
partner is very focused on his career
our families you know we both
got kids multiple kids and so for me I
see it as a as a good cash flowing asset
that I hold and then I think the biggest
key is that it keeps me true to my brand
right what I love about what you're
doing and your podcast and and and your
channels is you're true to that

[38:02]
channels is you're true to that
co-founders brand right you're true to
these Scrappy guys coming in there you
know I'm assuming from probably not much
right you know maybe a degree that your
family maybe helped you with right I I
don't know your whole story but and and
you're building the American dream in
multiple ways and you're helping others
do it and for me that's one of the
reasons I think I'll just probably keep
fireworks as a piece of my
assets put it under a holding company
for the future it keeps me true to my
brand I'm a small business guy I'm a
scrappy entrepreneur and I can look an
entrepreneur in the eye as their CPA and
say hey I know what you're going through
I know what it's like to have somebody
cancel your lease two days before you're
supposed to sell I know what it's like
to have an employee steal money from you
I know what it's like to have bad
accounting this I know what it's like to
have a landlord compete directly with
you and have absolutely nothing you can
do about it most people do not know what

[39:00]
do about it most people do not know what
that's like I don't think I've ever
experienced that yeah and I so I love it
for that aspect it's it's helping me
grow what what's going to be a small
business entrepreneurial Empire of my
own that all started with a fireworks
stand and a phone call at a CPA firm
when I was 25 years old yeah that's
awesome it's kind of like it's kind of
like the professor the entrepreneurship
Professor or business professor that
never had a business right it's like H
you're speaking from a textbook and
you're like hey I'm speaking from real
life what do you think you'll do in
Revenue this year you're like optimized
you've got five you got solid locations
what are you hoping to do in December
yeah so that season the the goal is to
get up to 200,000 for five locations
right okay thinking back to the
beginning it was 100,000 for two our
thought was oh you add two more you're
at 200,000 you add five or
250 it it's been a struggle to get the
two the goal is to get the two we want
to get 200,000 in revenue for the five
locations MH I don't know if we'll get

[40:01]
locations MH I don't know if we'll get
there this season but I would bet it the
election might affect it right if the
election goes one way we we very well
may have the best season of our life and
it's crazy to think that that could
happen like an election affecting me but
it
could what about Dali is that an
opportunity you know it's funny to ask
dwali is a cool season and we really
want to sell for it but the the state
allows you to sell but your county has
to give you permission and we were
denied by the County due to we haven't
had a lot of rain and they said due to
the drought conditions they they didn't
want to let us sell but I think dwall
could be huge like i' we've thought of
just building out a whole company being
the main one to do dwali because the big
guys don't do dwali because it's not
it's not worth it for them yeah all
right let me ask you this so pretend I'm
not so busy and I'm going to go do this
right because that's what I do I chase
shiny objects and I've been importing

[41:00]
shiny objects and I've been importing
stuff from China for 15 years been to
China a couple times doesn't scare me
let's say I I've bought shipping
containers before I'm going to go buy a
shipping container I'm going to buy some
fireworks I'm going to get my licenses
find a location is that doable for
someone like me or is it just not the
best and highest use of someone's time
it's
doable the reason that I'm not even a
huge proponent for every business doing
acquisition
entrepreneurship in this one case I'm
really glad we did it that way because I
think it would be really hard to go have
a really good profitable season just
doing it cold turkey but you might if
you can find the right location and if
you're Scrappy enough you know maybe
nobody's doing great marketing for
fireworks there's a there's a guy in
Kansas who's developing a whole
marketing company for firework companies
the marketing is really tough I mean how
do you do you can't advertise no nobody
will let you advertise fireworks because
they're considered firearms and

[42:01]
they're considered firearms and
lethal how do you advertise yeah man I
I've been literally that's been in the
back of my brain as we've been talking
like this such a such a location driven
business I would experiment everything's
a test right so it might not be
profitable but I would love to have
someone out there by the road in like
the week leading up to it for just like
Rush Hour morning and afternoon maybe
two hours each with a massive sign like
a countdown sign and it's just like
seven days until we're open six days
until we're open five days and then get
like you know you see like the
Inflatables they've got like big
Inflatables like for marketing and then
they've got like massive ones that are
like 30 40 feet tall they probably cost
a few grand I'd buy one of those things
and just like let my freak flag fly for
the week leading up to it when you
looked at it on Google there a moment
ago did you see the the van with the
arrow on top uhuh just go back and
Google it real quick and I guess any is
listening just Google big Arrow
fireworks there's a reason we're called

[43:00]
fireworks there's a reason we're called
Big Arrow because the the owner I kind
of had a McDonald's moment you know Ray
Croc seeing the golden arches when I
first saw the big Arrow it's a 23 foot
arrow that he mounted on top of a van I
don't see it I'm looking at the one next
to
Apollo Arrow so go go to the website big
arof fireworks.com okay okay I got that
ped up too I see it yeah that's massive
but it's like something has to be
dynamic about it or you just your eyes
get used to it right we've got some big
blowup Rockets we've done there's
something I've almost lost
the the the passion to go you know get
get out there and and wave signs but we
we've done some sign waving but yeah you
know there there there are some major
things you could do with marketing I
think to really bring in a lot of people
and maybe I just need to re kind of have
that that Chris Chris kerer energy and
say you know what let's let's freaking
do this let's invest some money into
just going crazy and getting to come in
I here's a couple ideas so when I had my

[44:00]
I here's a couple ideas so when I had my
iPhone repair shops my third location
was bad it was a bad location it was in
Huntsville Alabama it was the busiest
intersection in the in the county 60,000
cars per day went through that
intersection and it was like an L-shaped
shopping mall and I was in like the
elbow of the L like far from the road
tuck back my signage could only be like
so big and so like despite being an
amazing inter section it was a bad
location if we didn't have a sign
spinner out our sales in a day would be
like $200 which is like three iPhone
repairs yeah but when we put a sign
spinner out there it would be like
$1,500 it was just like night and day so
clear this is effective this works you
can also buy for like 2500 they have
like mechanical robots that you plug in
with an extension cord and they hold a
sign and they just like rotate yeah and
it looks kind of creepy you could do
something like that if I were you I
would even and I know I'm looking at the
the signage of the arrow on your website

[45:01]
the signage of the arrow on your website
and it looks very affixed but I would
find a way to weld that off remove it
like you could be doing yourself a
disservice like I know it's convenient
and affordable to be there year round
but to appear that you're there year
round you
know because it's like you want people
to be in the habit and to remember that
you're there every year which is the
strength of being there for years at a
time but you want that cue to be
triggered when it's almost time to buy
so they're not like so their eyes aren't
so used to seeing that Arrow yeah that's
a great point and and what you're
getting at there is is it's the classic
business dilemma you can
never you can never underestimate the
value of having a interaction with your
customer and that includes that the
arrow is moving versus not moving
catching those eyes I I think that's
huge and I think it's easy we've had
Five Seasons now and we've seen that
it's been pretty consistent across the

[46:01]
it's been pretty consistent across the
seasons and I think it's been easy to
kind of be like okay well you know it
just sort of happens and it does yeah
maybe we need to have a little more
faith in dude you just got to get wacky
with it adding some flavor five five
locations is like not an AB test but
it's an A B CDE e test like you could
test five different marketing angles at
all five locations and then just compare
those sales against July yeah not a bad
idea wow this one was up 5% this one was
down 5% which tells us the marketing
didn't do anything this was up 30% we
need to do that at all five in the
summer yeah you know I'd love to say
like oh you need to do Google ads you
need to do email but like no I don't
think so you can't do Google ads the
email thing that that's what this guy in
Kansas does he's he's helping companies
get good email lists and good text lists
and you know just getting back in
your that is interesting and what I've
seen people come in sometimes they want
to do a deal right if they want to spend

[47:00]
to do a deal right if they want to spend
$1,000 on fireworks they want you to
throw in a few things and I've been
wanting to teach the managers who we
have to to really get a little bit
better at the negotiating thing because
you don't want somebody who is unskilled
in negotiating like oh hey they bought a
thousand so I gave them 500 free you
know like yeah that's not good you know
yeah yeah but but at the same time like
you you want to do things that gets
people to come back and we've had it
where we got some emails of people we
sent them emails and a couple of them
came back so I think I need to have a
little more faith in that too maybe a QR
code or something like hey we have a
high Google review count because we you
know get a free firework if you leave a
Google review maybe we need to do that
for the other stuff too it's just it the
the one last thing I'll tell you about
fireworks is you you everything you
learn and everything you're like oh I
want to do that next season all that's
on your mind on July 5th and if you
don't record those feelings then by
October 25th which is today it's all
feelings you used to have and it's hard
to get get those back I'm going to

[48:00]
to get get those back I'm going to
completely walk back what I said about
email the more I think about that
because I think if you were to do
something kind of quirky like have
delicious cookies there like chocolate
chip cookies or something or or ice cold
water or soda or something it's like hey
and like don't involve the fireworks at
all you don't want to touch your margin
but it's like hey if we can get your
phone and email you can have this free
soda or free cookie and asterisk we are
only going reach out like a week before
the holiday twice we'll reach out to you
twice a year we don't want to spam you
we just want to remind you like you're
just being totally transparent we want
to remind you that you're here I bet you
that could make a massive difference
yeah and when people buy fireworks they
want to get the best quality and the
best deal you got to have faith to get
in front of them man this is good thank
you Daniel I appreciate your time where
can people find you if they want to
reach out best thing you know biger
