[00:00]
one more time if I can go live and if I
can then great if I can't then we just
won't go
live all right so we're still good on
YouTube now let's try
this I'm like about to quit going live
all together just because there's always
issues
yeah it's hard to find like a good live
streaming software I haven't found one
yes it
is yeah
um okay so I think we're good I can
still hear
you okay cool okay
um all right just

[01:00]
okay all right sa sorry about that so I
hear that you have a SAS business that
you're trying to
grow that's right yep all right let's
hear about your business I want to hear
all about
it okay cool um maybe I'll give you a
little bit of background before I tell
you about the business so you kind of
have an idea how I get into it and then
U I would love some ideas on growth
strategy and kind of where to go because
I feel like now we're like in a super
interesting spot um
anyway so uh to give you some background
I've been working with Shopify for like
eight
years um started doing development work
and ran an agency for many years um and
a few years ago I kind of decided that I
wanted
to create my own product for Shopify I
had a lot of knowledge for how the
platform works I knew kind of what
customers were looking for more or
less and um I set out to create my own
product

[02:00]
product
and it took like two years of
brainstorming um different ideas and and
all that and last year I kind of settled
on what I was planning to do and I ran
with it um and it's very different
project than what I normally do um as a
Shopify agency owner
um you know I I I've I've mainly just
worked on Shopify websites so jumping
into that whole software space you know
developing apps was like a whole whole
new realm you know figuring
out just everything as we go the design
the development the server structure
like I didn't even realize like Shopify
apps are are actually not even like
hosted on the
Shopify uh server like you're you're
hosting your own apps and it's basically
like an iframe in the site so this this
whole thing was just like very very
interesting um but I jumped in head
first I I probably should have done some
more research before going full force
but I maybe it's like you know kind of
like one of those things about you know

[03:00]
like one of those things about you know
like marriage like I had you known
everything about that person would you
actually have you know went through with
it um before you proceed so you already
own a Shopify agency or at least you did
at the
time yeah I I still run it now um and
I'm trying to transition more into
having the SAS be my my full-time thing
um very passionate about what type of a
Shopify
agency it's mainly just a development
agency so we do a lot of theme C
customization work Custom theme
development integration um yeah that
kind of stuff okay so what gave you this
idea for the app and then what is the
app and why did you feel so strongly
about it to spend a couple years on
it so uh I I really have just been kind
of bouncing around different types of
ideas
for
um for applications for Shopify and
there's a lot of stuff that c that I

[04:01]
there's a lot of stuff that c that I
noticed had already been done a hundred
times on the App Store you know there's
100 bundle
apps 100 upsal apps 100 different you
know whatever so I really took the time
to to try to identify a potential
problem you know maybe something a
little bit more unique um that users are
experiencing and um come up with the
solution to give you an idea the the app
itself um is is called clip coupons it's
uh based on and believe it or not it's
uh unique concept for for Shopify but
the but Amazon's been doing it for like
seven you know six or seven years um
it's introducing coupons directly on the
product page spelled uh K Li i p if you
want to check it out okay and um yep
and uh there's a lot of benefits behind
it first of the psychological benefit of

[05:01]
it first of the psychological benefit of
having coupons on the product page um in
addition to
that what you know it's it's a proven
concept Amazon's been doing it for years
um and the idea is behind it once the
seller is on the product page having
that coupon there kind of puts them in a
position of control you know you can
offer them a discount code where they go
to check out they forget the code they
Mis entered they get upset there's all
these issues with you know manual
discount codes the alternative is
automatic discount accounts and
discounts while they're great a user may
not necessarily even know they're
getting that discount because it's
automatic when it's getting applied yeah
I look at as like them strategic
introduced friction right like it's
exactly a little bit of friction to help
get to help them make them more likely
to get to check
out exactly um and the app itself has
has proven to be um helpful to many

[06:00]
has proven to be um helpful to many
store owners um basically it's been four
months already uh you could probably see
we we achieved built by shopy status
we're featured on the Shopify
homepage um anyways so we're building it
out it's it's actually a much bigger
project than i' anticipated the app is
uh turning into a full featured kind of
discounting and coupon system for
Shopify so there's a lot of other
features that are going to be introduced
um down the
road and a lot of lessons that I can
share you know about this whole SAS base
and you know customer service being
number one and you know building your
customer road map uh building your
development road map around the
customers and all these things anyways
but the reason that I I wanted to reach
out to you um was that first of all um
our app is free and it's a strategic
decision to make the app free um a to
gain you know a sizable chunk of
whatever market share we can in this
space um and be to get the feed back to

[07:00]
space um and be to get the feed back to
kind of put us in a position we can
where I feel comfortable charging people
for
it um with that being said it's it's a
massive investment I mean it's um you
know so every week is just money going
into development and into our VA team
and customer support team and marketing
team um so I can't sustain it
forever
um but my question to you is one at what
point do you kind of know in this space
that perhaps it is uh time um that you
can start charging for the product that
you know you've built out enough of a of
a product that has a large enough Gap
that you can start charging for example
if we if we made this paid in the
beginning um it it would be you know
very easy to make a similar app but
having um built it out already over the
course of you know months and going on
to a year I'm adding features and all
these different things it's it's
not such an easy app to develop anymore

[08:01]
not such an easy app to develop anymore
it's become you know kind of its own
animal yeah um anyway so that I'm sorry
I I should I just that's that's my
question to you and you know obviously
any advice you have for me on the
journey um it's my first software
company um my you know I thought it
through obviously the end goal is like
an acquisition if I can get it up to a
certain amount of Mr like these these
things these app companies are like at a
45x multiple which is insane um the
reason that I got into this business
um yeah okay that's what I've seen in
the Shopify space so okay do you have
any data on how effective your app is at
increasing conversion rate or average
order value does your app capture that
so I've been very I've been very
hesitant to put out precise numbers um I
think right now we're still trying to
figure out exactly what those numbers
are and how we can say it comfortably
without being like hey like install this
app to boost your you know conversion

[09:00]
app to boost your you know conversion
rate by 8% or whatever it is um but
across the
internally I have I have an estimate
yeah but it's it's very rough it's it's
only been a few months that we've been
testing this out okay and how does it
look it's definitely an increase um you
know we we've seen stores that with the
coupon it could be you know anywhere
from like a 2% increase in conversion
all the way up to
10% and what is your hesitancy to to
release that data just because it's you
have a small sample
size small sample size varying sample
size across Stores um there's a lot of
things that go into kind of the
effectiveness of coupons so for example
if you have a store that's selling an
item um that's like $15 you know and
you're offering a uh a $1
coupon okay like it's it's redeemable
but people are not going to be so
incentivized as a store that's all
offering a $500 item with $100 coupon

[10:00]
offering a $500 item with $100 coupon
for example um so that's another part
that goes into
it as well um and I think right now my
goal is to build up our marketing you
know try to get those case studies from
some of our clients try to build up um
actual data that we can present and I
just don't feel like I I'm at a point
where I can do that yet what have you
done to grow so far how have you gotten
these first
users um
we're like at a very interesting type of
growth I I can show
you uh I don't know if I if it's
possible just like block out the numbers
at some point but it's like
um something like that oh wow okay is
that mostly
organic like you just it's all organic
you this in the App Store and let it
go yeah running like some ads very minor

[11:00]
go yeah running like some ads very minor
um on the App Store and I just brought
on someone as like a full-time marketing
person so just spinning up like social
media going full-time into content I
think our main play is going to be app
Partnerships from what I understand
seems to be working pretty well okay
um but I guess it's you know we'll see
are you able to AB test pricing I don't
know how it works on the back end on the
App Store but would you be able to run
paid ads towards your app with a price
tag on it to see how they might
perform
yes and that to a
degree by AB testing you mean like the
actual pricing of the
app it would it would have to be like uh
you'd run a certain price for a month
and then change it and run another price
to be honest the the Shopify abso
architecture is not as greatest people
make it out to be um so there is

[12:04]
make it out to be um so there is
limiting and lacking a lot of features
but the data that we get is is quite
limited from it okay have you ever
thought of making your own Shopify uh
Facebook group like for Shopify store
owners I know a guy that has built a
Shopify app Crazy Fast and the way he
did it was by first starting a Facebook
group for Shopify store owners not
selling anything and then kind of
building his product in public in the in
the Facebook group even though it's
already built right like hey guys what
do you think of this feature what do you
think of that feature and he's the only
admin so he can talk about it as much or
as little as he wants and then over time
it just becomes this very organic
marketing vehicle to drive uh traffic to
the app of people that feel indebted to
you um I I know it it sounds easier than
I'm it's harder than I'm making it out
to be just oh let's just create a
Facebook group and people will flock to
it
a lot of times if you find a category of

[13:03]
a lot of times if you find a category of
Facebook groups that's popular for
instance real estate find a subcategory
of that that seems to be underserved I
started a Facebook group a couple months
ago specifically for off-market uh RV
park deals there were a ton of Facebook
groups for Real Estate a handful of
Facebook groups for RV and mobile home
parks but nothing for off Market um and
I got this idea from my friend I can't
claim it but people just come in
organically
and it's it's top of funnel so it seems
like you're kind of using the app store
for top of funnel um but what if you had
that right downline a little bit right
and you you had some sort of a community
uh that you could push down the funnel
to the App
Store yeah that's actually really
interesting do do you think
that promoting this is something that
would be promoted organically within the
group or um meaning like he would
respond you know your friend you

[14:01]
respond you know your friend you
mentioned would respond hey by the way I
think this app would work really well
for what you're doing or um is it
something that's like like part of the
group like this app is you know
sponsoring the group or whatever it is
it's really neither it's the admin SLC
creator of the group just openly post
about how the app is going right so he's
not commenting on other posts and he's
not doing sponsored post he's just
talking about building in oh we just had
this annoying customer that asked for a
refund yada y
and they just come to know this app and
then come to use it I I also think that
you should get on the phone with your
customers most Shopify app store owners
they don't think to or they don't want
to because it's high friction but they
will tell you exactly what your app is
lacking whereas even if you have like a
feedback form or I see you have great
reviews if if you get them on the phone
give them an Amazon gift card or
something they will get very specific on
what they love about it and what they
don't love about it

[15:01]
one of the things that we're running
into is like uh
actually with our customers um because I
think it's super important like to ask
for feedback and to try to understand
what's lacking um and one of the things
that we noticed is that there are some
comp
issues and doesn't necessarily have to
be because of our app but for example
like there's other apps shopified that
offer uh functionality
like um like a quantity upsell so they
have a little thing where oh buy three
get 50% off or something like that and
what happens is a lot of those apps just
the way that they work um they they
actually o because our discount takes
place in the product page those
discounts usually take place in the car
page when they apply it it just
overwrites our discount so a lot of
times people come to us like your app

[16:01]
times people come to us like your app
like um your app doesn't work like you
know and we have to be like like it's a
little bit of a problem like there's
other apps are causing like some
compatibility issues with our app so I
mean I'm curious to know if you have any
suggestions on handling those types of
things or you know maybe ways to to work
around you know those issues I guess
maybe even building those features into
our app if they're if they're looking
for them if that is a pain point then I
would suggest doing exactly that
building it into your app if it's not
too
cumbersome um have you are you able to
change your pricing model or when you do
introduce a pricing model are you able
to charge a percentage of like savings
or percentage of the um of the
cart yes but I'm hesitant to do that
because uh I've been reading online like
some people that have done that and some
customers get upset because that the
pricing isn't so clear up front so then

[17:01]
pricing isn't so clear up front so then
they get the the bill at the end of the
month and a lot of people um like wait
where did this come from right I could
see that you like usage based apps yeah
yeah
I there's a lot of apps that make a or
that charge a lot more money than you
might think on the surface because of
the usage based um pricing but if I were
to suggest three things I would suggest
either piggybacking onto some existing
Facebook groups for Shopify store owners
or starting your own and just getting it
going you can use builtwith to find a
list of Shopify stores to advertise them
to I would also suggest talking to your
users actually on the phone if possible
um seeing ask them straight up would you
pay for this how much would you pay for
and you can even tell them like listen
be honest with me and I'll make this
free for life like I just want feedback
right what would you pay for and I'll
keep it free for you the third thing I
would do is I would go ahead with your
data that shows your your increase of

[18:00]
data that shows your your increase of
conversion rate and I would put that
front and center on your app store if
you want to put an asterisk on there
fine but anytime you present data
there's a million wh ifs or variables
that could change the outcome of that
data and you can be as transparent or as
opaque as you want on that but I think
that would make a really really big
difference because as a Shopify store
owner myself I want to juice that
conversion rate every bit that I can and
any tool that I can find that will help
me do that um I want so I would I would
put that more front and
center in regards to the the third point
that you mentioned with you know
advertising the conversion rate
increase how would you go about that
would you set that up as like a case
study and then present that to someone
so they have like a reference to it or
I'm just trying to think of a way to do
it that people are not get goingon to
get upset you know like how can you
claim this number like where where are
you getting this information from I
don't think that's gonna happen I I
think it would take a a large amount of
customers to be seeing that or

[19:01]
customers to be seeing that or
experiencing something contrary to what
you're stating for there to be someone
upset I I I think you're overthinking
that um I think you should do a case
study and email that out to your current
customers and then take like the tldr of
that case study and put that front and
center makes sense but yeah hope I hope
that's
helpful yeah no I I really appreciate it
um I I guess in in your mind do you have
any feedback on the the app itself like
as as an idea of what you know do you
have any for me as it it reminds me of
when I we go to the grocery store go to
HB and they have paper coupons in the
aisle and I'm just like what are you
doing but they know what they're doing
right and my my kid always rips all the
the coupons off whether or not we're
buying the item um but it's just like
it's strategic friction and it's the
same thing but in real life you grab the
coupon and it's like okay now now now I
need to take this somewhere and hand it

[20:01]
need to take this somewhere and hand it
to somebody it's just a digital version
of that and I'm I'm pretty shocked that
it didn't exist already so I I do think
that your idea has Merit and it has legs
I would be very hesitant to hire a
full-time marketer or to really pour
resources into it because I think this
is something that you could bootstrap
fairly fairly
cheaply so to what degree do you think
you could bootstrap it I'm just curious
like like
how just by doing these three things by
actually getting on the phone yourself
with these users um experimenting with
the paid ads a little more I just have
maybe I'm too cheap I just have a hard
time understanding what a full-time
marketer would do at this stage in the
process of your of your app I I feel
like you're too early for
that full-time I would I would probably
say full-time employee part-time
marketer but um I I was the main thing
that I figured um would be really

[21:00]
that I figured um would be really
helpful with was our content so being
able to create you know um YouTube
videos uh to explain our app and
different functionalities and um social
media posts and stuff and then it turned
out that we actually had a big demand
for bringing on someone to help with
customer support because we're getting a
lot of queries and so it turned into
more like a full-time position um
helping with with that as well now
multiple roles
then yeah basically okay that makes more
sense just one person and we have our
our freelance development teams it's
fairly bootstrapped I maybe I made it
sound a little bit bigger than it is but
it's it's just it's really just me
freelance development team and this this
this one other person that I'm working
with okay that makes sense well um I've
got a jet man but thanks for coming on
let me know how it goes I appreciate it
man thank you so much for your advice
and uh I'll keep you posted how how
things go maybe could reconnect at some
point okay sounds great thank you love

[22:02]
point okay sounds great thank you love
that thank you Chris take care see
you all right we've got Michael we had
Ben Ben I'm sorry it took so long you
can come back I'll I'll put you in right
after Michael uh Michael just joined so
let's get right into
that Michael yes sir how you doing man
hey Chris I'm good how about you good so
I've had you I've had your question in
front of me for a couple weeks and it's
really interesting um you're out in West
Texas you like how many people start an
untraditional School in West Texas it's
not normal apparently just one yeah
that's why I wanted to talk to you I I
always rate the questions from one to 10
and I think you were a solid eight and a
half so awesome well thank you yeah so
tell me about uh mlo Acton Academy yeah
so it's it's a learner-driven school it
was created acon was created by gu Jeff
cifer in a about 12 years ago he has an

[23:00]
cifer in a about 12 years ago he has an
active NBA program and the the story
is why can't there be a school in the
21st century that is relevant I mean
nobody disagrees that the school system
is a joke Traditional School does not
replicate anything like what we see out
in the real world whether you're an
entrepreneur or not and uh so he built
the School kind of based on the Acton
MBA which is a no fors 12 month you know
really really fast NBA program
and so he launched the school several
people said man I I I want to do this in
my city so then he created the ability
to basically uh be an affiliate and so
we start licensing agreement um yeah I
guess so I mean they have zero they have
zero input on how we run the school uh
they they basically give us access to
materials and stuff like that and we we
uh we run the school as we see fit so
it's the exact opposite model of the
Traditional School where uh the the
young people are in charge I mean we

[24:00]
young people are in charge I mean we
don't have teachers we have sycratic
guides they're not even allowed to
answer questions in the
studio are you willing to share Revenue
numbers sure yeah yeah so how long have
you been opened and then if you could
just share like yearly or monthly
whatever is most relevant yeah we
started uh in 2020 right in the middle
of covid with like six families all
right great timing actually we had four
families we had six Learners and uh and
four families fast forward to the day we
have 20 and um we charge 8,500 a year
and so I mean our revenue is going to be
around 120 I don't know what the math is
you said six Learners or eight we we
have 20 oh 20 I say yeah you started
with six right um okay so 170 Grand a
year roughly MH okay and has that been
growing steadily for the last four
years yeah
uh it we had a few families leave uh

[25:01]
uh it we had a few families leave uh
last year um our Middle School is real
small and so some of the
families felt like hey we want we want
our kids to be around more than just
three or four other kids and yeah so we
had a few leave but was that the
feedback that there just you didn't have
enough critical mass at that age right
yeah okay but you know I I guess that's
why I'm asking the question is like well
what's more important I I my my question
question is you know how old are your
kids 8 10 12 14 okay so yeah it's like
what I I just I don't know if I'm not
getting the right message across if I'm
not communicating this correctly
everyone that I sit down oneon-one
everybody leaves a conversation going oh
my gosh this is amazing this is this is
so great you're doing you're you're
doing what needs to be done I'm like
okay great you want to apply uh I don't
know I don't I don't think so
it's just such a big change right and

[26:01]
it's just such a big change right and
yeah I want to I want to go back to the
question you just asked where what's
more important and I don't even think
that's the right question because I
don't think you're going to change their
mind if they think that having friends
at school is more
important I I would think I would say
you just attack that from a different
angle because that's just I don't think
they're gonna change their mind right
yeah um I mean you're clearly and
naturally more biased than your
potential customers because you love
this and this is your baby and you know
all about it inside and out um but to
them I think they're just looking at
this like a huge huge life change and
it's kind of like oh it's like we should
move to Europe oh that sounds amazing
let's move to Europe then it's like ah
too hard you know this is an actual
conversation that I've I've had with my
wife yeah so do you have any idea of
what your percentage Clos rate is from
people that are interested or receive
the info packet or talk to you in person
uh no it would be very it'd be very

[27:00]
uh no it would be very it'd be very
small we have a we have a a lead magnet
on our website and I get notified when
folks um you know sign up for that and I
mean we probably have three or four a
week that will request more information
and they'll go through a three email
series um all of them with a some kind
of call to action to either schedule a
call or um apply and they did they get
they run through that nothing really
happens and then I have I have assistant
I I run another company also and so I
have my assistant and that company kind
of helped me out so she'll she'll follow
up with the ones that have gone through
it after a week she'll hop in there and
email them and say hey just you know any
questions and and usually it's just
crickets now let's talk more
specifically about your funnel so they
go to the website they fill out the form
and they then they get a three email
series and then is that the order of it
yes okay and then at what point do you
reach out and try to get them on the
phone uh about a week after the last
email after the a week after the third

[28:01]
email after the a week after the third
email yes and how long does it take for
those first three emails to go out every
two days one one every so six six days
I'm gonna pull up your website
here so they're clicking request more
info specifically right
yes okay
so how many people click schedule a
phone call verse request more info do
you have any data on that
oh I would say hardly anyone schedules a
phone call I mean once a month maybe
very few people schedule a phone call
okay so when they do though are they
more hot to trot are they more likely to
close well no because what we found is
the ones that do it's it's more
like they were just you know they just
have a very specific question like hey
is this a they they didn't read through
the website they're like oh this is a
private school you charge tuition like

[29:00]
private school you charge tuition like
yeah you know they're like oh I'm
looking for a charter school sorry
thanks and they're just they're just
kind of like in a hurry not like oh my
gosh I can't believe this school is in
our city this is so amazing tell me more
about it yeah that that that hardly ever
happens how are you driving traffic to
your website
today I I'm not um just or I correct
yeah I don't I don't I don't pay for ads
um we have a really strong pretty strong
social media presence my wife does all
that stuff and so we're really active on
there and we've had people that reached
out and say man I've followed you guys
for for Years love what you're doing and
you know then then ask for more
information so really we don't have
anything that is paid that's driving um
traffic mostly because I'm just scared
of Google ads I've never used Google ads
in any of my companies I'm kind of
scared of it seems like a scam uh I
don't really know maybe you maybe maybe
I'm
wrong um with all the ECT you're wrong

[30:00]
wrong um with all the ECT you're wrong
right I'm sure I've felt the same way
and one of my business partners still
feels the same way even though and it's
not Nick it's another one and I love him
to death but even though we have seen
positive Roi from Google ads for four
years straight he's still just like uh
and I I told him like a month ago I was
like I'm gonna turn off ads just watch
and I turned off ads and traffic died
and he went and turned it back on
himself right so I get it and there's a
lot of people and I've read stories of
companies mostly billion plus dollar
companies that have just turned off all
Google ads and didn't skip a beat that
happens but that's because they're not
tracking it closely or they're tracking
the wrong thing or they're doing like
brand campaigns for brand awareness kind
of like a Coca-Cola billboard on the
highway you know like who knows if that
actually works but I don't do that stuff
ever because I'm like you I'm cheap I
don't want to waste money on ads
especially to a multi-trillion dollar
company that is happy to take it and
have they know all the tricks in the
book to take it right and so I will only

[31:02]
book to take it right and so I will only
do paid ads that show me a very clear
attribution and so I love the idea of
Google ads for this business because it
is local and because Google will tell
you exactly who in your county is
searching for terms that might be
relevant to your business um I don't
recommend that you go out get an agency
I recommend that you actually invest
some time to learn it yourself um good
Google ads is in my opinion 8020 right
like you can spend a few hours learning
the 80% of it and see a positive Roi um
and an agency they might help you scale
it better but you're not you don't
really need to scale it because you're
not looking to take over the world um
and they'll help you hone in that last
20% um while they'll really refine the
keywords and they'll add in some new
keywords but I don't think you're really
going to need that I think Google ads
could help have you spent time
interviewing or talking to other Acton

[32:00]
interviewing or talking to other Acton
um license lies to see what they're
doing or how they're doing yeah a few
and I think it amarello is a very unique
situation the other ones are mostly in
bigger cities and so in Austin there's
probably six or seven of these and
they're all on a weit list I think a lot
of it has to do with you know income
right so I mean you've got folks yeah I
mean just everyone's you know Private
School in Austin is 30 40 Grand so the
Acton Acton Acton down there are
charging 15 20,000 a year and that's the
cheap version of private school and so
that seems to be uh what what what I've
found there's not a there's a couple of
of outliers like one like in Nebraska
that has caught traction and I guess got
in with the right few families and
everybody told everyone about it and you
know they' got 40 50 Learners in their
school but not I haven't seen a lot like
uh demographic or city like Amarillo

[33:00]
uh demographic or city like Amarillo
that's just just really caught a lot of
traction yeah so you've got I'm I wish I
was a savant and I had all these
memorized but I just looked it up you've
got 200,000 people in Amarillo you've
got just under a million in Austin right
so if Austin has six or seven
theoretically if the demographics were
the same which they're not then you
could
support an Acton with a weit list right
theoretically and I believe even without
doing data I I think you believe that
too right that that it is possible to
completely fill up uh your weight list
um yeah and let me be clear like if we
had 60 out of 200 thou I mean I'm
looking for I'm looking for 60 Learners
that's it yeah if you were to take your
20 Learners um and take their parents
and how would they rate their
satisfaction with you on a scale of one
to 10 like how much are they just in
love with what you're
doing uh all in and we uh we actually
have to do a net promoter score and turn

[34:00]
have to do a net promoter score and turn
that in every quarter to Acton that's
one of the things that we do and it's
it's on a scale of five and we're we're
4.5 every time do you know how that
compares to other
locations no they don't share that with
the network I I haven't seen but you you
can't drop below a four I think before
you start getting like H maybe you
shouldn't be en acted anymore yeah if I
were you I would do several things I
would
get other actant owners on the phone as
soon as possible because you could you
could bang your head against the all
trying to learn all these things but I
guarantee you you're going to find one
person that just makes one little
comment that just sets up the light bulb
for you you know like oh well no they're
gonna be like well don't no don't do
that like you got to go through the
schools or you got to go through the
whoever and it's just going to be this
light buold moment that will save you a
lot of time and a lot of money so I
would just cold call them honestly um oh
and and they they would they would be

[35:00]
and and they they would they would be
fine with that the Network's super
generous there's only 300 actins all the
world and so they're very generous with
their time if if one calls another one
we would always help each other when was
the last time you called like corporate
and asked them for help you can't really
do that there there isn't there's one
guy that's kind of over the whole
network um it's a very very uh uh um
Skeleton Crew I guess if you want to say
um it's it's very very similar to
CrossFit that's is how CrossFit got
started right they they kind of put the
thing out there and you Affiliates you
could take it and run with it whatever
you want to do is
great okay
so that's the first thing IID do I would
talk to the other owners I would look
seriously into Google ads um because
Google is more intent like Facebook ads
are fine but you want to find people
that are searching for like alternative
schools or alternative schools near me
or unhappy with my school or something
like that it might not be as direct as
you're thinking right and where do I

[36:00]
you're thinking right and where do I
start with that because I have done that
a few times in some of my other
businesses like I I'll get on there I
have a Google ads account and I just get
overwhelmed like so quickly like and
where would you start if I had zero
experience to learn about Google ads I
would start on YouTube I I I can't
recommend anyone specific but I would
bet there's dozens of very high quality
YouTubers that specifically talk about
like the how to of Google ads you can go
take a 50 udemy course I had a friend
that did that in short-term rentals and
it changed the game form that might be a
little more structured for you um but if
not you to me then then just YouTube is
it you to me uh you to sorry UD DM y the
letter U DM y UD to me yeah it's a
course platform and another thing I
would do which I'm even more optimistic
about is I would take a page out of like
the whole clickfunnels I would go to
like the cringiest course gurus you can
find and look at how their funnel works

[37:02]
find and look at how their funnel works
because it works like there's there's
this Airbnb Mastermind and this I don't
know what it's called I don't want to
promote them but they I think it costs
like 12 Grand to like learn how to be a
short-term rental owner and this website
does like 20 30 million a year selling
these high ticket courses I would go
find one like that okay and just reverse
engineer exactly what they're doing and
treat it just like that because the
biggest red flag to me about your whole
funnel right now is that someone's
really excited about what you're doing
they fill out a form and then they don't
speak to a human for over a week I think
that you need to take your form and you
need to shrink it down and just do name
phone email that's it not kids name
nothing else name phone email and then
you or someone needs to get them on the
phone immediately and strive to get them
to your facility in person as soon as
possible I guarantee you your close rate
will just exp explode because it's just

[38:01]
will just exp explode because it's just
this is just it's just sales it's a lead
and every every second that goes by that
you don't get that lead preferably in
person if not on the phone they just get
colder and colder and especially with
such a big life decision like this you
got to talk to him faster than that
okay um yeah that's what I would do go
find a really cringey guy on Instagram
and look at what his his process is and
copy it and just put something actually
ethical behind
yeah yep cool well thanks for your time
Chris I appreciate what you do anytime
Michael let me know how it goes I will
thanks all right yep see you see
you
David hey how we doing hey good how are
you man I'm doing fantastic all right
you got a little kid
there I always have a little kid that's
just my life right now
that my youngest he's uh two his name's

[39:02]
that my youngest he's uh two his name's
Owen Owen hi
Owen he can't hear us because he's in
the headphone hope he's not too loud
there it is no no that's fine um all
right so let me pull up all right you've
got a bootstrap company that's about to
hit 10 million in Revenue right yeah
we're we're uh tracking to do about 11
or 12 run rate right now awesome good
for you and what type of company so I
know I can't get too specific but we're
in the outdoor space kind of a weird
Niche we sell small Log Cabin kits and
ship them all over North America that's
cool okay who's your Target customer so
our Target customer is 40 to 65 years
old they live in the city but they have
a rural property outside the city and
they um are generally small business
owners professionals kind of you know
middle class upper middle class people I
would say and their values are like
family they want an extra space for
their family to stay so they can have
everybody at the cottage or everybody at

[40:00]
everybody at the cottage or everybody at
the lake house or or the like okay and
how much do your homes cost so they're
really homes they're like um you know
small kind of bedrooms essentially but
uh somewhere between about 6,000 in the
low end to about 20,000 in the highend
wow super cheap and that's for a kit
that's for a kit so you build that
yourself and and part of the experience
is that you're building a bun with your
friends and family and they're they're
like a Lego kit or an um like uh link
logs for adults if that makes sense that
is awesome and it they're meant for the
homeowner to put together themselves
it's easy enough yeah but yeah about 85%
of home owners built themselves we've
got a really great set of manuals and
build videos and build support to get
people through it so so no one has tried
and failed everyone has tried to do it
has pulled it off wow now what type of
foundation do they need to put these
down depends on the area but you can get
by for as like with as little as just
put some gravel and some patio stones
down or you can make as comp as like a
you know um pad a fulling cement pad if

[41:00]
you know um pad a fulling cement pad if
you want to go nuts okay and what about
electrical and
plumbing uh doable in a lot of areas
once you stray into Plumbing you're into
permits required um so a lot of people
avoid it for that reason but uh the
electrical side of things you can just
run Conduit on the walls um it's pretty
straightforward to do
that so it's not it's not glamping it's
not a tiny home it's a it's a proper cap
you put together yourself that's 10 to
grand exactly right okay that's really
interesting and although we do sell to a
lot of glamp grounds and uh like we have
we're we're kind of trying to get the B
like our B to B Dimension is a lot of
people coming through the B Toc funnels
and still buying it for a campground or
for like a wedding venue or for a
trailer park that type of thing um and
so B2B is like n if that makes sense we
should be able to reach out to be B2B
clients but we have not really nailed
that yet okay so you're mostly doing uh
B Toc yeah exactly how are you finding

[42:02]
B Toc yeah exactly how are you finding
them so primarily uh paperclick on on
social
media uh and then we do a big promotion
every year we give a bunky away but
still paperclick feeding that funnel
into a a 30-day kind of win this bunky
and then oh you didn't win so buy one
okay what percentage of your leads are
closing side unseen no sales call vers
after a sales call um the site unseen
thing it's rare like people are usually
emailing in once or twice there isn't a
lot of randos just come in and we're not
an e-commerce store we've experimented
with having e-commerce but generally
with a larger ticket item they're going
to want to like fill you out they
usually call once or twice email in like
there's like three or four touch points
before they like feel safe enough to
give us money over the Internet um and
then we also have phys like we have a
factory where we make them and so people
come in and see we have a little village
of bunes there as well and then we're um
yeah so people will see them sometimes
in person but it's a good it's a good
minority of people that have never

[43:00]
minority of people that have never
actually like physically been there and
then we're working on a virtual tour so
we've got a virtual tour experience that
you can kind of Take A A salesperson can
guide you through a couple models and
and sell you that way that's awesome and
have have you ever done like a group
sales call or a webinar or anything yeah
I've like abysmal show up rates right
now so I've been I've been running them
by weekly and like you know 50 people
sign up and one shows up um yeah we're
we're trying to tweak that but but the
the contest we where we do the giveaway
I'm doing a series of live streams where
you know we'll do one on the foundation
one on um you know stains and so there's
like an educational Dimension to that
and if they go through that 30 days and
they're tuned into those live streams
they're they're pretty Sol by the end of
that so a big bulk of our sales come
through like the week after the contest
closes okay and what uh how big is your
email list it's about
350,000 oh wow wow that's a great yeah a
lot of that is is chaff uh there's some

[44:00]
lot of that is is chaff uh there's some
wheat in there but a lot of people that
want the free bunkey are not necessarily
going to buy a bun right so it's a lot
of yeah how often do you email everyone
as opposed to just segments um we try to
segment as much as we can but um we got
a monthly newsletter that goes out once
a month everyone okay so if you're going
to cross 10 million then you're selling
like few hundred of these things a year
uh no like the goal this year is a
thousand um wow okay yeah so like last
year did 900 roughly okay yeah the a is
around 11 11k okay yeah I guess I went
hide there okay so your original
question now that we've got all that out
of the way is at what point should you
um specialize your your sales process
vers maybe not specialize them at all
and just keep it broad right like
account manager to marketer to
salesperson yeah well like so right so
right now it's it's just a duct taped of
what's what's organically grown up right
so um we've got like people that have

[45:02]
so um we've got like people that have
been with us since day one a few people
and they're very much like oh I want the
whole customer joury I want to like you
know take them to the factory show them
the bunky I want to sell them I want to
help them with their delivery like talk
to them like they want to do all the
steps of the way I call that the sherpa
model like they take them up all the way
up the mountain that's what they want to
do um I've always been more inclined to
like I just want to sell them and then
give them to someone else and they get
invoiced and they get and want to make
sure the delivery happens and we have a
pretty good track record of delivering
on time and people being pumped um but I
can see benefits to both angles so it's
like Sherpa all the way up the mountain
with maybe a little bit of support here
and there versus like you know one
person just sets appointments one person
just uh you know does a me middle call
one person closes like that's the the
Baton method and it seems like a lot of
people go in that direction it's a lot
more measurable and you can see who
sucks um a lot easier but it's it's uh I
don't know if we're at the right size to
do something like that and I don't I'd

[46:00]
do something like that and I don't I'd
like to figure out from someone who's
kind of been there and cross that Chasm
from like you know five million to 15
million or 20 million so you're
exclusively doing the sherpa model right
now then
right uh well so right now I'll tell you
the sales person so uh we do have
outbound people to just call leads um so
they're making 130 calls a day their
whole goal is set appointments um but a
lot of times people call in so inbound
leads so you might talk to someone
they'll say hey let's go on a tour book
a virtual tour book an actual tour and
they might take them to the point of
close so it's like a weird hybrid of
both um so we have uh this appointment
Setters two of those people they're from
the Philippines then we've got a couple
people in in the factory like showing
people bunkys or doing it virtually and
then we've got um another person
remotely in in Britain that can do the
virtual tour but not uh using like a
Zillow kind of tour
um doing able to do virtual tour so my
thought my thought process is like the

[47:00]
thought my thought process is like the
more we can make it digital and not
everyone has to be at the factory the
better so yeah have you ever
experimented with an appointment setter
that was uh based here in in North
America as opposed to the Philippines
not yet I would definitely try that just
because it's such a high ticket item
such a big purchase um the amount of
savings that you get is probably neg
negligible if you can get your
appointment set rate up just a few
percent right yeah that's fair I would
AB test it as well um keep keep your
Filipinos and and add a couple and just
side by side um how many calls are they
each making versus how are they how are
they comparing because it's not even the
the and I know Filipinos have great
accents but it's not even the accent
it's just the the weird kind of cultural
quirks that might only show up one every
three or four phone calls that really
make a big difference where someone in
North America can just make off-hand
comments that are much more relable much

[48:00]
comments that are much more relable much
more relatable to the person than
someone overseas might yeah that's good
nice thanks uhhuh um all right
so you're kind of doing a hybrid model
do you know of any competitors that are
doing one or the other like who are you
looking to for an example on this like
the problem with our little niche is
like I really I struggle to find a super
analogous competitor everybody in the
like it's the kind of model is like guy
named Chuck with like a a corner lot
that sells sheds and there's hobos
living in them and like that's kind of
the model for the shed Biz um so it's
not super analogous to what we're doing
um and then there's other smaller
competitors T but we've so far in the in
the small cabin space the bunky business
were I think quite quite like probably
five or six times as large as anybody um
it's hard to say and and then you know
we we email our competitors like what
happens after that and there's no real
like I don't feel like I'm in a process
or any type of sales funnel so we're
kind of trying to lead the charge here

[49:00]
kind of trying to lead the charge here
what I what I try to compare ourselves
is like other high tech items like hot
tubs boats um like anything like that
that I could say oh I can I can learn
from that that vertical but it's not
necessarily us right or I guess Outdoor
Living Like Outdoor Living is probably
the most because they're selling High
ticket stuff sometimes too so and if if
you were to say let's just pretend for a
minute that your whole sale cycle uh not
just the Sal cycle but the whole life
cycle of a customer is 100 days and yeah
at certain point they actually
pay and then at a certain point their
cabin is completed where would you put
the payment in that 100 day timeline so
our model right now is we take
65% up front to make the bunky to help
us cash flow it and then 35% a day or
two before you get
it um so that's the but it's not 100
days like there's there's like 700 day
closes on a lot of our clients like
right so we're trying the whole point of
appointments and and let's book a tour
is like shrink that down ideally 100
would be if I was if I had 100 day
closing it would be fantastic now
sometimes it is two weeks but oftentimes

[50:01]
sometimes it is two weeks but oftentimes
it's like two weeks but like I've been
watching your YouTube channel for two
years so yeah
right what about between the time that
you first speak to someone and you
collect the 65% what would you say an
average is there an average is there it
just depends how hot they are so if
they're hot it might be you know a day
like a day to 10 days um we often give
people 10 days to pay that so you know
if they start chipping away we'll call
them in so that's yeah probably like one
to 20 days okay I feel like I feel like
you should test the specialized model I
I think that if you were to just get a
killer closer um to to get them there
someone really friendly and then just
get someone really really nice to see
them through the end of it uh because
they're not going to get their deposit
back I I assume right like if they
continue wanting to go through it yeah
it is a refund deposit uh but it's only
when you we sell your buy to somebody

[51:00]
when you we sell your buy to somebody
else so we don't to take people's money
for no buy but um we have a kind of it's
refundable as soon as someone else buys
it basically which is usually pretty
fast how many take you up on the
refund our our refund rate's pretty low
it's like uh maybe 1
in3 okay like over the course of a
season you know yeah I feel like you
should um did you hear the last call
that I was just on no I was in the
waiting room and I couldn't hear
anything
so I I gave him the advice because that
was another high ticket item
to take a page out of the cringey course
gurus Playbook on Instagram that try
selling High ticket like $10,000
masterminds and courses and just analyze
exactly how their funnel is and yes
that's like finely or like highly
refined over years and years of gurus
selling on the internet right and you've
got a Setter you've got a closer and
then you've got a third person that
actually fulfills yeah I feel like they
that is the model I'm leaning towards

[52:00]
that is the model I'm leaning towards
like that's what my intuition tells me
to do um yeah yeah that's that's what I
would do like in my uh crypto business
we have something similar because we
sell a $5,000 product and we there's a
lot of handholding that needs to go into
that product for years after they buy it
because we also host the product right
and so in that sense it's easier for us
to keep it the same person because there
are going to be a lot of touch points
along the way it it'd kind of be like if
your customers were still interfacing
with you for years after the house was
built like they had
to it as of the fact that they're good
to go once the house is built I like the
idea of specializing in your case or at
least testing it you don't want to of
course go all in on it because you've
got a good thing going yeah that's fair
so your advice is essentially like lean
like yeah get a
few like while you have the appointments
that are just set it up in that kind of
handheld way yeah that makes sense yeah
like just three Setter closer

[53:01]
like just three Setter closer
fulfiller yeah that's kind of yeah that
makes sense that's kind of what you're
doing today well I mean fulfiller like
by fulfiller it's like you know someone
invoices them and then another person
makes sure that bukey physically gets to
them and all that logistical fun yeah
the logistics is what I mean by filler
yeah yeah that's kind of I I mean kind
of the model right now we can just lean
heavier in it I think yeah okay well I
hope that helped I'd love go yeah
appreciate your time okay thanks David
okay my pleasure
bye Christian yes sir how are we doing
man I'm really sorry about you know
being late oh it's fine I tried twice
though I tried twice I was you know
giving you some chance I figured you
were pretty busy with the other you know
um people yeah we always go over so it
it worked out just fine awesome awesome
so all right you've got kind of a unique

[54:01]
so all right you've got kind of a unique
problem let's hear about it yeah pretty
simple pretty simple you know I'm having
50k
um let's say for example somebody
followed me right and I'm having like
people I guess important people
following me let's say 50k followers
100K 150k and I'm just wondering like
some of them want to you know pick my
brain
and I'm just wondering should I charge
them a Consulting call when should I do
it when should I not do it because when
should I you know do you kind of get
what I'm trying to say yeah let me add
some context for people that are
listening or that will be listening that
don't know so you're talking about
Twitter specifically right like you have
a Twitter account yep that that post
business stuff we'll keep it kind of
broad right you post interesting
business stuff and then people reach out
and they're like hey you seem smart um I
want to make money doing what you're

[55:00]
want to make money doing what you're
doing uh C can you help me and so you're
asking like what do I do with that do I
charge sell my time do I sell a product
do I sell a service is that right
absolutely yes I bet you get tons of
those yes yeah and where are you where
are you leaning today what do you want
to
do um honestly I'm I just want to if
there's if I can make
money with the Consulting calls I will
but at the end of the day I've helped a
lot of people by not you know not
charging them a lot a lot but um I mean
money but some of them are sending to me
10 15 questions in a DM I'm like dude
I'm not going to be able to answer all
of this yeah so you're better off you
know um setting up a Consulting code
with me but I also don't want to be rude
that's that's my main question here I
don't want to be rude especially for
those that might find um might find it

[56:02]
those that might find um might find it
as a rude answer if I say that to them
putting into perspective that they have
a bunch of followers you know like dude
you know I don't want to come across
like a let's say like a bot you know B
head or something like that
yeah so I've dealt with the same problem
I I think there's a to do it where
you're not rude I I think that you
should have like a cop Cy paste kind of
explainer that's like listen
statistically speaking if I said yes to
the amount of people that dm' me I would
have no time to run my actual business
so I just can't and so I think at that
point you need to put them through a
filtering mechanism I've tried several
different things I've charged for my
time before and it's actually shocking
how few people are willing to pay for
your time right yes I agree when I
started I charged like 200 bucks for an
hour or a half an hour and this is like
this is high ticket stuff like you could
find out in an hour exactly how to buy a

[57:01]
find out in an hour exactly how to buy a
mobile home park that makes you six or
seven figures but PE like the conversion
rate on that that paid cenly is tiny
tiny tiny and so I eventually took it
off because I'm like I feel like this
does more harm than good like I'd almost
rather not do any of this than make a
few hundred dollars here and there um
and then how you were go ahead sorry
yeah you this is probably what you're
about to say and then I put it at like
$1,200 per hour just to kind of weed
everyone out and guess how many people
paid for that zero like not one person
has ever paid that right which is
honestly fine because I I don't like
hopping on these calls because it's it
doesn't seem efficient and I feel in
like I don't pay for Consulting calls so
I feel indebted to them and so I always
want to go over I always want to deliver
a ton of value and make sure they're
super super happy um and it ends up
being fine but it's just it's it doesn't
move the needle much to to make a yeah

[58:00]
move the needle much to to make a yeah
and it's not yeah it's not scalable
either so I totally agree with you so I
think you should do one of two things I
think you should um you should create a
course and I say course but I mean I
really just mean a PDF just take all
your tweets that are relevant upload it
to chat gbt or do it yourself or give it
to your assistant and have them just put
it in like a coherent like an ebook
right call it three to 5,000 words
probably doesn't take that long go to
gumroad upload it to gumroad make it 20
bucks or 50 bucks or something um and
just tell them hey just have a copy
paste like listen if I were to say yes
to everyone I have no time like I I
really don't mean to be rude I just
don't have the time and so I put this
together so because I already know what
you're gonna ask and this is going to
answer 90% of your questions go ahead
and buy this if you still have questions
at that point you can say I'll just hop
on for free or I'll charge for my time
uh after that point but most people

[59:01]
uh after that point but most people
aren't even willing to pay 20 bucks they
just want something for free right y
even if they have a lot of
followers um I agree yes I think another
thing you could do which has been my
solution to this is you don't like
you've got to get people into an email
list or a free newsletter or something
just so you can touch base with them so
when you do sell something more High
ticket
maybe that's you're fundraising maybe
you're selling an agency service that's
two grand a month when you do sell that
you don't have to go blast it out there
to everyone you can only tell the people
that you feel are the most interested
that gave you their email months or
years
prior okay so would you consider any
different approach to let's say someone
that is sorry my God it's wrong um
someone that is let's say kind of famous
or influenced or something like that
would you take any different approach I
would yeah I mean I would do it on a

[1:00:01]
would yeah I mean I would do it on a
caseby Case basis um I that's what I
wanted to confirm yeah I make exceptions
all the time for this like sometimes
people reach out to me that I look up to
and admire and it's like dude I just
want to talk to you like I want to ask
you questions and then it becomes more
of a a give and take instead of just a
take you
know I got disconnected for a for a
little bit I'm back oh yeah I'm just
saying when it's PE certain people that
I admire and look up to then it becomes
more of a give and take than
anything okay well perfect hey Chris

to confirm I had that idea in my mind
