to rent one for a day renting it for $100
for an hour and you can do that 10 times a
day A viral growth hack that I've never
heard of anybody taking advantage of If
you do that to a hundred people and one of
them signs up as a customer you're adding
a quart million dollars worth of value to
our company I'm going to do it Why would I
not do it have you heard of these Tens of
thousands of women come out to these They
say good is the enemy to great So I'm
okay having good companies if my life
is great because of it You ready i'm fairly
certain I know exactly who Satoshi Nakamoto is
I've talked to a few founders this week This is
something that I always find funny and I know
you've heard me joke about it Lots of times when
you're starting a business you're like "Oh yeah
I'll buy a business I'll just hire a operator."
Right like I'll just get someone to operate the
business Or they haven't ever gotten into the
business yet And they're like "Uh I don't want to
be working in the business I want to be working on
the business I got to get out of the weeds." Right
you've we've heard all these where people say
these we've said these things Yeah So I think this
is a framework that entrepreneurs should think
about and really really take to heart There's

[01:03]
a period of time where you are the business
You're the business Sh And then there comes
a point where you become the bottleneck and the
business becomes the business And this is how I'm
kind of thinking about it You go from having a job
We talked to Tyler He's got a job right now He's
got no systems no processes It's on Google Sheets
there's nothing that can be replicated Pretty soon
he'll have a highpaying job which will be great
And then eventually he will have a business And
the way that I define a business is this is an
entity that can operate on its own generating
cash flows without you for at least 3 months
And I the reason I said three months on there is
because I really don't think any business should
be operated without its leader quote unquote right
but there's a period like it has enough systems
and expectations in place and SOPs that it can
continue to run and operate without you But it
takes time to get to that point And if you as

[02:01]
the founder are thinking about oh I got to get
out of the weeds first you're discounting the
most valuable thing about your business which is
you Because in the beginning of your business your
differentiator your product is you You might be
smarter than somebody in a certain way You might
have a specific skill You might have a innate
genius whatever it is you're the differentiator
And if you try to remove that too quickly you're
removing your differentiation and your competitive
advantage So I like to think of it in three phases
Sorry four phases Phase one where you're doing all
of the work You're the business You're the agency
Phase two where you start outsourcing things that
are non-ifferiated Payroll accounts payable admin
work Okay and then there's phase three where you
start outsourcing things that are differentiated
but that are not your zone of genius So it might
maybe your sales process is different or maybe
your marketing tactics are different but that's
not you know Chris Kerner's highest and best
use is not on the operations right he may be
doing something that's differentiated on the
operations but that's not his highest and best

[03:00]
use So you offload those things first and then the
last phase is you offloading your zone of genius
And I think what a lot of founders do instead is
they focus on oh I just got to get myself out of
the business right now And they think they have
to offload everything at first And as a result
the business suffers because of it They don't take
this measured approach of like okay first things
that don't need me second things that do need me
but aren't differentiated Third the things that
do need me and are differentiated I'll do last
I just think that's a great framework to think
about if you're starting up a business is hey what
phase am I in where can I afford to be operating
just so you have a road map for what's next and
what's coming What do you think i agree And not
only does it suffer because of the fact that
they're outsourcing things too quickly but they
don't even know that it's suffering because they
don't know what it would look like had they not
done that right it like there's no AB test for
that Let's say they're growing 30% a month They
step out and they're growing 20% a month and it's
like "Oh okay Yeah I'm okay with that." But what

[04:00]
they don't know is like they could be growing
40% a month because it was a seasonal business
and they were rounding the corner to March and
April right and so 20% a month is actually half
of what they would have done if you wouldn't have
stepped out too soon So that's the hard part is a
lot of times you don't know what you don't know
and and you can't truly AB test life outcomes
Yeah And they like fall in love with this idea of
oh I'm going to remove myself from the business
It's going to be passive income is going to like
okay m maybe when you're a $10 million company but
you're trying to do that at like $200,000 a year
in revenue you haven't built the thing yet It's
not big enough to have the things that you need
in order for it to be quote unquote passive You
need systems You need processes You need SOPs You
need people You can't have one without the other
But they're try they try to remove themselves way
too quickly We've done this I mean how many times
have you and I freaking done this hopefully we've
finally learned our lesson but probably not Yeah
we'll probably do it again I think this is true
at any scale size business I had this conversation
just yesterday with someone about Elon Musk Who's
winning the self-driving car wars right now i'll

[05:02]
tell you it's not Tesla It's Whimo Tesla should
be winning Tesla had such a head start They had
millions of cars on the road billions of miles
worth of data Two reasons why they're not winning
in my opinion One Elon said "We don't need LAR
We don't need it It's irrelevant Cameras and
sensors are fine." Well you're biased because you
can't sell Teslas profitably with LAR on the car
Whereas Whimo is like "We need LAR This is going
to be a $300,000 car but that's okay because we're
just learning right now." And now Whimo's winning
Like they're winning in the accuracy department
Right Right My question to you Nick is if Tesla is
the only business that Elon's running there's no
Neurolink there's no Boring Company there's no
Solar City anything you name it Are they still
losing i don't think so I don't think so I I think
Elon is the world's greatest entrepreneur hands
down no holds barred but the fact that all of his
companies have CEOs that he's the owner but he's
not really in the weeds because he doesn't have
enough time to be in the weeds that the CEOs like

[06:03]
they don't really feel accountable Like only the
owner cares about the business I don't care how
many shares the CEO owns or the executive team
owns they will not care about that business ever
as much as the owner ever will And if the owner
owns six businesses even if he has competent
CEOs I'm just saying it will be underperforming
compared to what it could be doing if it was their
only thing I'm going to say it a different way I
think that when big companies like that lose their
core their zone of genius that's when you start to
see the decline And I'm likening it to these small
businesses right like okay Chris Kerner's zone of
genius is growth marketing zero to one All right
and if you started a business and that was core to
that business and then all of a sudden you removed
yourself from that business it's not going to do
as well in that area as you would have because you
can systemize you can still systematize everything
but at some point it's not as good as you Apple
is a very good correlary for this It loses Steve
Jobs and what happens still highly profitable It's
still growing but they're not coming out with cool
new products They're not cutting edge anymore And

[07:04]
Tesla is probably an example of that right like
Elon moves on to to found other things The the LAR
versus camera sensors debate Yeah they're losing
on that It's because the guy who's the the driving
zone of genius in that company has now replaced
himself So it is a trade-off I think at that
scale Elon can do that and maybe he takes a
20% hit in market value But if you're like a
$100,000 business and you're an entrepreneur you
can't afford to do that yet Like you don't have I
guess flexibility to lose that much market value
because your your business crashes But it's the
same concept right like you're removing the thing
that made it what it is it's not going to do as
well Yeah And you just have to be aware of it Like
I'm not even saying Elon's doing anything wrong
Like he's netting out way ahead His net worth is
is way more that he has all these things Right And
just like owning a hold a hold or a parent company
Right Right It's like just know what you're going
into and you know what that's not optimal That's
not optimized That's not optimized But that's okay

[08:03]
because I want to own six different things and I'm
cool with that Buttally like you said if it's a
$200,000 business and this is supposed to support
your your income and you just quit your job just
just know that Yeah Because you're not you're just
not there yet You're not Elon You're not Tim Cook
You're not Mark Zuckerberg You're running a B2B
agency that does digital marketing All right Like
get to a million dollars in revenue first and then
we can start talking about whether or not you have
a leadership team and what your ethos is You can't
borrow problems that aren't your problems yet
You've got to deal with the problems set in front
of you Otherwise you're never going to get to one
five 10 $20 million Yeah They say good is the
enemy to great And my question is like what good
or great are you measuring are you measuring the
financial performance of a company or your quality
of life i'm measuring for I'm optimizing measuring
for the quality of my life So I'm okay having good
companies if my life is great because of it
Because if I have a great financial performing

[09:01]
company then it means my life is probably good
because I'm not enjoying it as much That's great
So that's the thing I've been thinking about this
week I like it I like it I got something for you
You ready all right let's do it Let's just get
back to the basics We're going to talk about good
oldfashioned business ideas You ready i'm ready
Freddie I think someone needs to start like think
of Turo Okay for those that don't know Turo is
like the Airbnb for cars You buy a car you can
rent it out to others and it's doing really well
And the best Turos are the interesting vehicles
like Cyber Trucks right if you buy a Camry put it
on Turo you're not going to do great Kind of like
Airbnbs Airbnbs are a little saturated You want
to do well you got to have a freaking treehouse
on the side of a cliff okay you got to be unique
Who out there is renting out like Cybert trucks
by the half hour or by the minute or by the hour i
think that would be a thing I think Cybert trucks
are a novelty They're really cool They're fast
They're Instagrammable People just want to see

[10:02]
what it's like It's $300 to rent one for a day You
don't need it for a day You just want to take your
girlfriend out on a date in it or something or
just test drive it Why isn't there a system for
that what are we doing okay I'll give you my
feedback I think it's hard logistically Okay
let's say you rent it Someone has it for an hour
Then someone's got to go pick it up It's got to
go to a place They've got to clean it They've got
to get it ready for the next person who's going
to be renting it So just inherently obviously the
per hour basis is going to be a lot higher than
a daily basis But but then the per hour rate
on a daily rental but I think I think that's
probably the biggest thing logistically If we had
self-driving then I think it becomes way simpler I
think it's just a a logist a logistical issue to
manage I don't think you need to clean it every
time depending on how long you take it out I
think renting it for $100 for an hour that's
a great price and you could do that 10 times a
day You could do the the Chris Kerner special
You could go and market hour usages of a Cyber
Truck and then go rent the Cybertruck for a day

[11:06]
Just like have it planned out Go rent the Cybert
truck for a day and then take it and let people
use it for an hour The hard part is insurance When
you do stuff like that obviously I'm never going
to let insurance stop me from wanting something
but imagine if you had a Cyber Truck you had it
wrapped QR code everything Drive this for a half
hour 30 minutes for $50 And you just start driving
It's like avail like if you see me driving I'm
available right now And you just start driving
around like a walking billboard wherever there's
you know downtown areas bars outdoor shopping And
it's it's more of an impulse buy than anything
And kind of like an Uber driver just kind of
drives around these areas waiting to get jobs You
do the same but you're just giving rides and you
sit in the passenger seat and they're they're
governors put on it so they can't go crazy And
there is a risk of insurance but I think someone
could make a lot of money doing this And I think
someone could make even more money if they did the
harder route raised a bunch of money and launched

[12:00]
a platform for this Your idea gave me an idea for
something else That's the whole purpose of this
show What did you think we're doing here Nick
so would would the truck have a QR code on it
yeah Okay Absolutely Here's something I've always
wondered and like I can't believe you and I have
never spoken about this cuz your mind I know would
just take this to levels It has hitherto been
unforeseen All right Moroni you ever been I was
on the plane flying by from Hawaii I took a long
video My wife's like "Oh let me get that video."
And what do I do do I text my wife that video
no Chris what do you do air drop it You got to
airdrop that shizz cuz it's too big It's too big
a file format So what I All right cool I airdrop
it I go to airdrop it There are dozens of people
who I could have aird dropped it to Mhm I've been
thinking about this and I can't believe we haven't
spoken about it but it just finally popped back up
I don't know cuz I'm not as creative as you Okay
How could you use that for the for a good bait
and switch like could you go to and I don't know

[13:03]
what the product would be but let's say you have
a product that you just want to get out or let's
let's say that you want people to go and tune
into your podcast and you just go to the mall and
you're like all right I have a link to my podcast
and I'm going to airdrop it to whoever just shows
up and you just airdrop it It seems like a viral
growth hack that I've never heard of anybody
taking advantage of We're talking about ebasses
here An ebass what's an ebass it's an ethical
bait and switch You ever heard that is that
not the biggest oxymoron you've ever heard ever
we've talked about these I've heard of a sea bass
I had never heard of an ebass So I love this I've
seen like memes and like reals about people
that have trolled others on planes doing this
right like taken a crazy ugly picture and air
dropped it to everyone on the plane But you're
right there could be something there It reminds me
of a reel that I posted a while ago of a of a guy
that posted QR codes all around the city and it
just said "You cheated on me I can't believe you

[14:04]
did that." And then anyone walking by will scan
that and when they scan it it just leads to some
guy's Instagram page which is like the lowest and
worst use of someone's captive attention But it's
the same principle So I think you need to have
something high ticket enough You got to find that
balance between mass market enough and high ticket
enough because you're not going to be able to
airdrop this to thousands of people an hour right
it's going to be like dozens of people an hour if
you're in the right place because proximity
like you have to be close enough to that many
people All right I'm going to go to me Let's say I
wanted to promote the podcast How could I do that
how could I go and find a place where many people
are gathering at the same time concert a sporting
event a sporting event a conference conference
Maybe I go to like the industry conference Like
why could I not drop a thousand links to my
podcast just walking around a conference you
could It reminds me of retention.com the software
that where you can basically swipe email addresses

[15:02]
from people browsing on your website without them
opting in People do that It's a billion-dollar
business but those optins are very very very
low intent because they didn't opt in you know
So that's your problem there is it's a low ticket
offer It's just a free podcast and it's low intent
So you can do it How many people will actually
subscribe and listen it's a spray and prey type
of an approach Like if I'm doing email marketing
or SMS marketing or whatever It's the same kind of
it's just a numbers game at that point right so
maybe I spend zero money but I go walk around a
conference and I send it to a thousand people and
I get five subscribers out of it which would suck
I wish I I got more I didn't spend any money
I guess you count my time walking around the
conference Yeah So I guess your framework would
be much better What would be a high ticket item
you could do that with and where would you go
to sell that high ticket item so let's go back
to conferences Like we're going to Holdco comp
in a month or two right a conference for Holdco

[16:02]
business owners Let's say we had a competing
conference okay that was 6 months later We
would it would make sense for us to buy a ticket
to this and airdrop this to everyone there and
say like anyone who gets this airdrop gets a 30%
discount but you have to book today Like that is
a very captive audience You like it it's captive
it's relevant it has you know they can afford your
conference because they just paid 8 grand for this
one It's high ticket Like that could be like the
sweet spot That's really interesting What are
some other like is high ticket impulse buy an
oxymoron probably is an oxymoron I'm trying to
think if there's any other high ticket like it's
an oxymoron but it's surely a thing right like
a it's a thing for people that can afford it I
think of a car brand or a maybe expensive luxury
handbag Mhm You know you go to a conference where
a lot of people Oh that would be interesting Okay
They have these bridal conferences Have you heard
of these like they're like bridal expos Yeah In
different geographies and they get like tens of

[17:02]
thousands of women come out to these cuz you
know they're getting married and they spend
a lot more time on the bridal expos You could go
to a bridal expo if you're a venue in that town
and literally just airdrop people That would be
a really cool use case because otherwise you got
to like pay for a billboard or you got to pay So
video is cool but you know what's better long form
audio via podcast and my newsletter tkopod.com Go
there to subscribe for free to my newsletter It's
one email a week Very tactical And then go to my
audio podcast Three episodes a week Stuff like
this You're going to love it All free No sleazy
sales [ __ ] tkopod.com You got to pay to be a
sponsor of You probably get kicked out but you
know who cares you'd have to pay to be a sponsor
of that conference but you just walk you buy a
ticket and walk the floor and like "All right
airdrop." Dude how about this this is going to be
very specific but you can take it to be anything
You buy a ticket to a Green Bay Packers game
Cheapest ticket you can buy Okay nosebleleeds
Let's say you have some affiliate or some let's
just pretend that you have a business that sells

[18:02]
you know Brett Favre autograph memorabilia
You got hundreds of these things cards you
know shoes balls whatever You walk down to like
the part of the field where the rich people are
right the expensive seats close to the field or
the sweets and you're just walking You didn't buy
a seat there and you're just freaking air dropping
everyone that you that you get near You can't tell
me you wouldn't sell something from that bro
$100 ticket to get in Bro Chris I have an idea
I think you're going to cramp your pants You You
might even tell Mohamd to edit this out I swear
on my life Are you ready i swear on my life You
could pay someone to go to the busiest Bies close
to you Mhm And just walk the floor or stand in
the parking lot and every customer for a week
every customer who comes in and out air dropped a
link to Texas Snacks That's your target demo dude
You're trying to get people who shop at Bies
but then you know can't buy it where they are

[19:01]
Tell me that's not a good hack dude It's a great
hack The only problem is I love Bies and I want
to stay in their good graces cuz I've thought
about many things I could do along these lines
I've literally planned out flyers on cars
sign spinners as you pull in and pull out
We literally put up a billboard on the highway
as you left the Bies in Temple Texas that said
"Buy Bies online texas.com." So I'm totally
with you and I would do that if I didn't want
Bies corporate to hate me It's a great idea It is
a great idea It's a really great idea But what do
we think about this memorabilia though come on
Okay Well I mean it's the same idea right like
you're just you're thinking about where can you
find your target demo that is going to meet in
person at at like a specific time and place like
yeah that that Green Bay Packers you sell that
me memorabilia go to a Green Bay Packers game If
you sell brand new is that your favorite band yeah
dude If you sell brand new merch go to a freaking
brand new concert and just airdrop everybody in

[20:03]
that in that place Yeah Have you tested like how
quickly can you airdrop 30 people if they're all
popping up i've never tested it I never test
people I'm gonna try it at church Are you i
won't Yeah why not you won't you won't try it Okay
I know you won't dude Cuz you're a freaking What's
that it's growing What is that thing looks like
a Why are you leaning so hard to the left weird
That's a good idea Oh I just love the idea of
brainstorming stuff like this you know like
walking through first class Those are wealthy
people What could you airdrop to them they're
traveling Maybe they're business travelers Like
I like the idea of getting even more granular
Finding an event with thousands of people going
to the part of the event with the wealthy people
because that equals the high ticket Finding
a high ticket offer product service that is
super relevant to them Oh dude Do this He's got an
idea I'm going to a conference next week Okay In

[21:03]
Boise It's in Southern California I'm going to
my brother-in-law's skilled nursing facilities
annual meeting Mhm At the annual meeting will
be every single sniff administrator He owns 60
plus buildings We have been trying to get this
product that we have into their sniffs And their
sniffs love it They do with the ones that have
seen it But it's just hard You got to get into
in front of every single administrator I'm going
I'm going to airdrop a link to Voltater I'm going
to do it Why would I not do it you You have to
do it Do it Do it in a certain way for me will
you okay I'm just thinking of this on the fly
Okay Google Doc Okay The best copywriting you've
ever put together in your life I'll help you Chad
Yeah just like heartstoppping copywriting because
heartstoppping copywriting combined with a really
interesting marketing method such as airdropping
strangers at a conference equals they will for
sure read everything in that Google doc provided

[22:01]
it's not too long So it's just like yeah this is
awkward You're sitting in a conference right now
and some stranger just air dropped you Guess what
that stranger is me Here's why I air dropped you
This will be worth your time I've been in your
shoes I've been a sniff administrator You know
what sucks about it cpt codes right yeah Or your
billing your billing coordinator is doing control
find to find things to bill Medicaid for It's the
worst What if AI could fix that for you da da da
Don't go too long And then you just put a link in
there a tracking link so you know who is clicking
and are they clicking oh I'm so excited dude Next
Friday A lot of money I'm back next Friday So we
will talk about how it went And most of these
people know me so they're going to be like "Why
am I getting a text from Nick what the freak?"
Like they're going to read it Yeah At what we
think our LTV lifetime value and our churn is
I mean $500 a month Let's say they stick around
for two years Could be much longer Okay That's
$12,000 Let's say our lifetime value higher than

[23:05]
that It's a,000 A,000 per month So $24,000 Let's
say that's our LTV Our churn is close to zero
$24,000 Our margins are they're healthy because
it's just software right but what kind of a
valuation does that add to the business i mean
this could be like a 10x revenue business from a
valuation perspective If you do that to a hundred
people and one of them signs up as a customer
you're adding a quarter million dollars worth of
value to our company I'm excited to try this dude
Say that dog will hunt Will that dog hunt hey dog
Are you going to hunt look at Chris over there So
we're done Yeah Yeah Yeah That'll do it Yeah Daddy
Will that dog hunt is that dog going to hunt Daddy
my gosh we're so stupid I love this
All right I love it All right How's
this for a hook i'm fairly certain I know
exactly who Satoshi Nakamoto is What i do

[24:04]
Okay I learned it secretly by myself from
a tweet that had over a million views Okay
Like what am I supposed to say to that
i'm so bad at this I'm so bad at this
All right If it's Jack Dorsey I'm going
to be real butt hurt It's Jack Dorsey
Why are you butt hurt cuz we read the same tweet
and I Yeah but most of our listeners have not Okay
I like many others have been wondering this and
I've I have never thought it was how Finny For
those listening that don't know the story Bitcoin
was created by a guy named Satoshi Nakamoto who's
completely anonymous There are lots of clues
pointing to about a half a dozen different
people I'm convinced it's Jack Dorsey Can I tell
you why yes Okay I read that tweet I threw away
about half of the quote evidences Yeah I'm going
to read to you a lot of the ones that sound the
most convincing to me For those that don't know
Jack Dorsey he is the founder of both Twitter and
Square the payments platform And for a while he
was running both of them at the same time At the

[25:04]
same time He's a billionaire He's a billionaire
Very eccentric Kind of weird I heard him speak at
a conference once It's very weird Of all the tech
companies in San Francisco Twitter and Square were
two of the very first to accept Bitcoin payments
Yes H okay So that's that's not in the tweet I
just find that interesting One thing that never
made sense to me and the reason I thought it was
Haline more than any other person is the fact
that whoever is Satoshi is is worth a hundred
billion dollars Close to that is Yeah like one of
the top 10 20 richest people on the planet right
it's really hard to not sell that Bitcoin That's
gonna be really hard I don't care who you are Okay
you either have to be dead like Hal Finny is dead
or you have to already be wealthy and not really
need the money Jack Dorsey is a billionaire I'm
going to go ahead for those people who are for
people who are like me that are morons and and
haven't known this stuff for forever Bitcoin was

[26:04]
invented quote unquote invented created whatever
you want to call it 2010 what was the year 2008
Okay somewhere somewhere in that ballpark And
the creator the founder of it Satoshi Nakamoto no
one has known who he is And there's been a lot of
intrigue around it Who is this guy he created this
thing and then he just bounces He just disappears
And as the price of Bitcoin has gone up because
Bitcoin is what they call an open ledger you can
verify every transaction We know whose wallet is
associated with Satoshi Nakamoto And that wallet
has just been sitting there untouched Y So every
year even as Bitcoin has gone up and down we
know oh it's it's worth hundred million Oh now
it's worth a billion dollars Now it's worth $50
bill Now it's worth a hundred billion dollars And
people are just watching it right and so that's
why the theory is okay either this guy died and
he doesn't have access to the wallet anymore or or
you know the keys died with him or he doesn't need

[27:00]
the money and he's you know doing something else
with it So there's been a lot of guesses There
was a documentary that came out recently that
pointed the finger at who did it point the finger
at i can't remember who it was but yeah there's a
there's like a small group of people that it could
be I hadn't really heard Jack Dorsey's name thrown
around until the last few years to be honest with
you I don't know why that is But this tweet that
we're referencing the evidence is Jack Dorsey has
been hyper involved with cryptography since the
beginning He was one of like 2,000 cipher punks in
1997 He wrote his graduate thesis on cryptography
and doing something that would impact the world
and then disappearing He launched Bitcoin around
the same time that he was launching these other
companies He pulled he started running Twitter
and Square at the same time that Satoshi kind
of pulled out of being an active member of the
Bitcoin community And Jack has like played up
the joke Like he talks about Satoshi all the time
He makes references to him like and he knew all
these people So I'm convinced too I wish I could
take the other side here and be like no it's not

[28:02]
him Well let me read some things I mean also he
was asked on the Lex Friedman podcast if he was
Satoshi and his answer was if I were I would never
tell you Oh okay So some more evidences He wrote
a manifesto on making a mark without leaving a
trace in 2001 Okay He made a blog post shortly
thereafter joking about that he was building
something in secret that would be a payment
network for drug traffickers Okay 2003 he posted
a blog about how he's interested in cryptography
pseudonyms hacks hacks happening at 4:00 a.m
specifically and more Post in 2003 Okay So
why the is are we going to find out why the 4 a.m
We're going to get there We're going to get there
Yep He posted in 2003 that he's trying to end
his dependence on the US dollar and creating a
barter network He referred to himself as Jack J A
K as a pirate like a sailor He had lots of sailor
references Okay Like Michael Sailor Like Michael
Sailor There you go Jack tweeted around the horn

[29:05]
and home again for that's the sailor's way back in
2008 Bitcoin was created the very next day Jack's
Twitter profile from ' 07 to09 had him listed as
a sailor Okay The original Bitcoin source code
included an old sailor's adage never go to sea
without two chronometers Take one or three There
are references to sailors in the Bitcoin source
code Multiple Okay The original Bitcoin source
code documents are all timestamped at 4:00 a.m
Jack always talked about being a hacker at 400
a.m Okay He accidentally logged in to edit the
source code without masking his IP address which
he always did And Satoshi yes Satoshi did And it
was an IP address listed in California Okay Well
California is a big state but that's where Jack
was at the time Okay The first Bitcoin transaction

[30:01]
took place on Jack's mom's birthday Satoshi joined
the Bitcoin forum on Jack's birthday and Satoshi's
last mind block was on Jack's dad's birthday Now
this is something that I find pretty convincing
Satoshi in the forum told people not to donate
Bitcoin to Wikileaks This was on December 5th 2010
Exactly 9 days later Twitter is hit with a secret
core order with a gag requirement to turn over
everything it has about Wikileaks So like this was
happening in the background when Satoshi posted
that like Wikileaks do not support Wikileaks 9
days later Wikileaks comes out against Twitter The
day before that happened before that gag order
Satoshi posted for the last time ever in the
Bitcoin forum He never came back Twitter's tech
lead a year later suggested that Twitter is going
to integrate Bitcoin payments Okay Jack Dorsey
calls Bitcoin an amazing movement in September
2012 Square publishes a book in January 2018 to
explain the legend of Satoshi Nakamoto in which it

[31:06]
makes Satoshi the Satoshi character look like Jack
Would people at Square have known that i don't
think so I don't think so But who gave someone
at Square the idea to make that book in the first
place and then the last one Craig Wright who is a
guy that has purported to be Satoshi No one really
believes it He's a total hack and a fraud There's
a big lawsuit in involving them Craig Wright's
attorneys argue in early 2024 that if Craig Wright
was not Satoshi then the real Satoshi would have
been expected to come forward to counter the
claim It did not dawn on them that the person
countering the claim was Jack Dorsey who was the
basis for this exact legal challenge to begin with
Jack Dorsey came forward to counter the claim
I guess I don't know much about the claim Why
would they have not known that Jack Dorsey had
I think Jack Dorsey was just stepping up as like
trying to be a responsible party on behalf of
Bitcoin Okay let me ask about some of those
The birthdays like his mom's birthday dad's
birthday Jack's birthday Those are incident

[32:04]
interesting coincidences And what were the
things that were done on those birthdays
like the last mind block the day he joined the
Bitcoin forum which is where all of this went down
and then the day Bitcoin was created because like
so many so many things were happening during that
period of time I'm sure that there there would
have been something where it's like you could
have chosen his mom's date and found something
that happened but those are I guess those are
pretty important things For there to be three
is kind of kind of crazy Is Jack known to be a
guy who's like into sending secret messages like
that i guess if he's into cryptography he is Right
Right people think of Satoshi as like some
really smart nerdy guy in a closet But Bitcoin
is not just code It is a business Like Bitcoin is
a business A business has to grow A business needs
to acquire users A business the best businesses
acquire network effects like Uber or Facebook
Bitcoin has all those things Twitter has those
things Square has those things right millions of
people selling products through Square Jack
is a hacker Like a growth hacker a marketer

[33:04]
a businessman a coder He's all of the above I
feel like it takes a genius like Elon or Jack
to actually get something like this out to the
world Like there are probably a lot of people
that could write the code for Bitcoin but who can
actually grow it like a business like I think Jack
has done well and if you look at it Satoshi
didn't just create this thing in his closet
and then like release it to the world There have
been a lot of people who have worked on this I
can't remember his name this guy came out and was
like "Hey you have this back door into that could
allow anybody to access any Bitcoin wallet at any
time." Oh cool So they they like you know they
fixed it Bitcoin Cash is a fork off of Bitcoin
Litecoin is a fork off of Bitcoin Like that's
why Hal Finny was so important and thought to be
Satoshi is because he was actually contributing to
the creation of Bitcoin So it yes there was like
this thesis but then over time a group of people
worked together to create Bitcoin And there's
still a group of people that manage bitcoin so

[34:02]
to speak The miners secure the network People
who are mining new bitcoins They're the first
statement in the ledger So they're making sure
that we continue to have very clear delineation
of provenence Where did it come from who did it
go to and where is it now so it's always been
a community Like it is a social network in that
sense Kind of a weird way to think about it but
it is Yeah I'm convinced Like I'm just convinced
I don't think those bitcoins are ever going to
move I think it's Jack Dorsey He doesn't need a
few more billion And I think it's amazing It's
incredible If that Bitcoin moves Bitcoin crashes
right period End of story because it's like people
that own Bitcoin or people that are in the no
It's supply and demand Like we're writing that
off And there have been a few times like with this
these court orders when we thought that Bitcoin
was about to move and Bitcoin crashed because
people just thought Satoshi's wallet was about
to move And Jack knows that So whatever he gains
monetarily he loses in the grand scheme of things

[35:01]
because the total market cap drops Satoshi's kind
of became become this myth like figure If anybody
was to be outed as Satoshi it'd be it'd be a let
down Mhm It doesn't matter who it is It would be
a let down Yeah Like oh man it was cuz you've like
built him up into this mythical like figure I mean
people have theories that he came from the future
Like oh he came from the future to create I don't
know if you've read any of those I go down all
those rabbit holes Like he came to the future
because he knows the dollar is going to crash and
so he wanted to create a currency that would was
like whoa Okay this is a well thoughtout theory
I guess I I'm more mean from the standpoint I
don't know that he wanted to sell Twitter He
could have had the money to buy Twitter if he
had gone and there are now sophisticated financial
instruments that will allow you to borrow against
Bitcoin as an asset right so he he could have
done that I guess there would have been a risk
that it would have leaked He would have had to
have moved it though You can't keep it in your
own wallet if you borrow against it because you
have to collateralize it You got to like put it

[36:02]
with an escrow service and then you borrow
against it Okay So you can't collateralize
it unless it's in a third party Mhm One of
the arguments against it was he was too busy
he was too busy founding you know Twitter and
Square to do it And it's just like that's like
saying Elon couldn't have founded you know
the boring company Neuralink like you name
it Like it's Parkinson's law These guys like
they need to be founding five things at once
That's how they operate Well I think that's part
of it but also they're complimentary all of them
and they're accelerants And like the underlying
philosophy of Twitter was that like they would
never go in and delete tweets It would be there
It's a public record It's the open ledger kind
of so to speak right and it's the network is
supporting it Same with the payments platform
that he's doing with Square or Block now The idea
was to to disrupt our current payment system which
is is still primarily a which is just nuts to
me All right Anyway I thought that was cool

[37:00]
All right What' you think please share it with a
friend and we'll see you next time on the Kerner
