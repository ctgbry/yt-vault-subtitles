do you ever go on a cruise and see those
flow Riders they kind of look like this
yeah of course you have there is an
insane business opportunity to buy those
things for 150 Grand you can get a loan
on them and put them where the people
already are forget cruise ships you want
to go find really popular malls like the
Galleria in Houston and Dallas and you
can rent space in their parking lot to
put the freaking Flow Rider in the
parking lot where millions of people are
already walking by every year go find
all these small mom and popop water
parks that could never afford one of
these and place them before you even buy
the thing get a contract in place place
it for instance one water park I went to
charges $5 to get in but if you want to
ride the Flow Rider it's $20 these guys
