look at this freaking thing right here
now if you're seeing this this probably
isn't new to you these machines have
been in every Home Depot for the last 15
years but it brings up an important
point I want to make if you ever heard
someone say something like well AI is
not going to be taking the Plumber's job
anytime soon and to you I would say are
you sure about that if you have a W2
right now and you're not solving big
problems then your job is likely to be
taken by AI the number of locksmiths in
the US has dropped from 20,000 to 13,000
over the last decade because duplicating
a key is not a big problem it's very
easily automated now getting locked out
of your car at 3:00 a.m. when it's
freezing out outside that is a big
problem those guys are still doing great
and they're charging more than they ever
have so if you're watching this video
and you're not spending 2 hours a day
learning and playing with AI I promise
you'll get left behind get my favorite
