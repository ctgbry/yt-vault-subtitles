[00:00]
and so I think there is a world where
you could this is an even much easier
sale than the stump grinding you call up
all the tree trimmers and say hey
today's your lucky day I'm going to come
get all your wood for free you let me
know where you'll be I got it you don't
even have to pay
[Music]
me welcome to the ker office the only
podcast where we discuss more business
ideas than your crazy uncle at your
family reunion I've started over 75
businesses when I first started this
podcast it was over 70 but we've started
at least five since then and this is the
place where I discuss all of them and
how to start more of them and how to
grow them all so welcome if you're new
to us then we're glad you're here today
we're going to talk about four or five
different business ideas Nick and I
holdco bro he is my partner we're going
to talk about we're going to go back to
the stump grinding business but add an
interesting aspect to it a way to get
your foot in the door with these B2B
customers integrating barbecue wood
firewood you're going to like it I
promise that's why we put it first next
one we're talking about self and how to

[01:00]
one we're talking about self and how to
chase your fat pitch and then the one
after that we're talking about the Shelf
dude a followup from the Shelf dude
episode that you just heard how you can
kind of use that idea to scale it in
your own Market with any number of
different services and then the last
thing we're talking about is licensing
different boot camps and master classes
in your local area as well a lot of cool
ideas I hope you enjoy it please please
please share with a friend and like And
subscribe and we'll see you next time
all right I'm excited about this one you
ready yes sir okay so our stump grinding
episode is now it's a hit it's a quote
viral hit viral for me she yep and
people loved it improved by Taylor
Tanner I'm sorry I forgot his name but
the guy who started a business based on
our episode of holco bros he started the
stump grinding business he made nine
grand his first 15 days doing exactly
what I said in my tweet which just like
this just feels so good let me just
pause for a second just I'm just going
to be a little cocky for a minute
because people in the coms ments the

[02:00]
because people in the coms ments the
haters and there's not a lot of them
we're going to say 5% I was like you're
you're grossly oversimplifying this
you're making this sound way too easy
what about insurance what and it's like
I am oversimplifying it yeah I am making
it sound easy first because that's how
you get
clicks no I mean luckily there is an
overlap there but because you can attest
this I'm a toxic Optimist everything I
do is going to be the next billion
dollar thing and that's why I do things
that's why I launch that's why I have a
bias for Action because I'm so
optimistic that it will work because I
don't do too much research that is a
mistake you do too much research and you
talk yourself out of it but we've all
seen the you know the trough of
disillusionment the graph where it's
like this is so easy I'm going to be so
rich like oh wow this is hard this is
much harder than I thought and then you
slowly start coming out of it and then
three years later right like I think of
like Texas snacks it took us three and a
half years mining syndicate we're almost

[03:00]
half years mining syndicate we're almost
four in now we're still learning it like
3 to six years later you're like this is
now somewhat manageable and easy and
profitable H I'm glad I did that right
and it's not every business but people
overthink it and it's like a coping
mechanism to never have to launch and so
if I oversimplify a I actually look at
the idea that way I'm conveying what I
actually believe B if I add too much
nuance and context then you aka the
reader or listener or Watcher will never
do anything and I want you to do
something about it so this guy he rented
a trailer he rented a stump grinder he
started texting tree trimming owners the
exact pitch that I told him to he
started texting all of them every week
just staying top of mine do you have
anything for me today do you have
anything for me today nine grand in 15
days his first 15 days in a seasonal
market right yeah so okay so I say all
that to bring my next idea let me just

[04:00]
that to bring my next idea let me just
really quickly please nobody is more
surprised that this idea worked than me
because we just lie all the
time you know let me take your joke and
let me add some truth to it okay we did
all this we did the research I had Kamal
hire a virtual assistant he called a
thousand tree trimming and landscaping
companies in Houston only one in five
answered their phone which there's an
opportunity in and of itself and the
data showed us about 10 % of these guys
are willing to Outsource stump gring to
us now it could have been higher if we
called if we sold it a little better if
we finessed it he was International he
probably didn't know that nuances in
culture could have been better but I
wanted to see more than that right
because that's like to me that's like
the Tam the total addressable Market is
10% basically 10% of all the tree
trimers and landscapers could be a
potential customer of ours I wanted to
see TW 20 to 50% and so we never
launched and I don't regret that the
other thing with your post is you are

[05:01]
other thing with your post is you are
very much the type of person who likes
the launch and the oh my gosh we're
going to be billionaires phase of it you
don't like the trough of disillusionment
or whatever like whatever the stages are
you don't like it when it gets hard
that's what she said and and you have to
work through it and build the stuff
around it so when you post stuff it's
very much hey this could work because
like you can go and validate that idea
but in order for the idea to be
successful it does have to have that
other half either you stay consistent
you persevere you build out the systems
like whatever it is but like what you're
say what you're saying in all of these
tweets that you do is like hey this is a
really cool idea this is how I would
start it you're like helping people just
get started and I think that's admirable
because it removes the stigma of like oh
this is going to be so hard I don't even
know where to start how do I even get
this done but you're showing people how
to generate the first dollar the first
dollar is the hardest and like once they
see that first dollar then they go in
and are willing to go through all the
crappy stuff because they've seen it
validated so yes I get it people look at

[06:00]
validated so yes I get it people look at
it and they're like oh you're
oversimplifying it but you're also like
demystifying this like first phase of
launching a business I think it's
awesome funny part SL maddening part is
when something goes viral right
something goes viral and I wish we could
predict when something will go viral we
we can't and let's say I get something
in my numbers wrong like I did a
pickleball tweet where I said I bet this
place does half a million a year right
and it turned out that this place has an
FDD a franchise dis Disclosure document
and you could actually find out not what
that location does but what that chain
of locations does and it was like 150 it
I was off by like 3x okay and then that
tweet went viral which I did not know it
would go viral I was covered in sweat as
I typed it I literally just played
pickle ball at that location and then
people hop in the comments and they're
like this is
irresponsible this is irresponsible of
you to get that math wrong because look
at all these people that are going to go
spend $850,000 on this franchise now

[07:00]
spend $850,000 on this franchise now
because of your Tweet I'm like dude dude
I did not know that was going to
freaking go viral if we were at to a
dinner party just talking and I was like
I bet that place does half a million a
year and I was off by 3x would that be
irresponsible of me for having wrong
back of the napkin math I mean
yes no I I had a post the other day that
did really well and it was like the six
things I wish I knew about the
SBA and somebody else who's like he's
like an SBA expert he's like oh look at
all the things that are wrong in this
post I'm like okay well what's wrong you
know what one of like the first thing he
named to me was well you said the max
amortization for a loan is 27 and a half
years it's actually 25 years oh my gosh
that's the first thing like you're going
to point to is I missed like I missed it
by two and a half years like the point I
was making is if you buy real estate
with a business you can amortize it over
a longer period of time but like I just
don't understand this compunction that
people have of like actually this is
irresponsible because like what are you

[08:00]
irresponsible because like what are you
talking about that wasn't the thrust of
what I was trying to post about I'm
trying to post so I can get people
motivated to act and yes you may have
been off by 3x but that's because you're
doing back of the envelope math and if
people want to go and correct it sure
help me understand where I missed come
and correct it but like we're not trying
to post this stuff to mislead people or
anyways yeah I think the the difference
here is like are we selling a course are
we selling a pickleball franchise and we
misrepresent something yes that's
a.com cofounders Nick for 10%
off that's a whole another ball game or
if you're selling a course and you're
like you can make $10,000 a month
guaranteed it's like whoa bro you're
oversimplifying like this is a lot
harder like we're not doing that we're
not do we're not selling it
anyway
so we're on like our third tangent here
our tangents are growing tangents so
back to stump gring
same industry same concept which is like

[09:02]
same industry same concept which is like
B2B Home Services different idea okay
you ready you're gonna like this you go
round up all the tree trimmers there
there are at least two ways where you
could make money here so we own a tree
trimming business therefore we know a
little bit about this tree trimmers have
to get their branches to the dump they
got to get them they got to chip them up
and haul them off that's half of the job
right one half of the job cut the thing
down the other half get it out of there
okay we're taking branches to the dump
every day at the same time Nick at the
same time there is a critical shortage
of barbecue smoking
wood same type of trees too Oak tell the
last word I had no idea where you were
going with that I we're talking about
trees and then you're like there's a
shortage of barbecue smoking hickory
wood I was like oh okay there it is
there's the

[10:00]
there's the
there is so I can't speak for every
state I'm speaking of Texas right now
but wood is sold by the cord and prices
are significantly 4X higher than they
were a few years ago what are you doing
hard to come by
okay what there's a shortage of
it it's significantly more expensive
than it was a few years ago okay okay so
we're throwing all these Oak branches
away when we could be selling it to
barbecue restaurants right or to a
distributor that sells wood to barbecue
restaurants okay now granted there's
some caveats there's some asterisks in
order to smoke barbecue wood you it
needs to be seasoned AKA dried AKA it
needs to sit I just gonna ask that yeah
it needs to sit outside for
months but there is a way to speed that
process up and that is in a kiln right
and so there is a company now that sells
a portable Kiln it's probably the size
of like an air conditioning unit like a

[11:01]
of like an air conditioning unit like a
large air conditioning unit and it
attaches to the end of a 20ft shipping
container that's it and it pumps it like
pumps hot air in there and it's a
seasoning process that like has existed
for a long time and if you if I go bar
buy barbecue wood from my favorite
supplier in Fort Worth they season
Theirs to speed up the process because
time is money but it's very expensive
and it's physical and it's on site and
it not a lot of people can do it and so
I think there is a world where you could
this is an even much easier sale than
the stump grinding you call up all the
tree trimmers and say hey today's your
lucky day I'm going to come get all your
wood for free you let me know where
you'll be I got it you don't even have
to pay me and eventually you can charge
for it and this is a beautiful business
Nick because this is what I call a
negative cogs business a negative cost
of goods sold business much like EOS
scraps the company out of Utah
that got paid by grocery stores to take

[12:02]
that got paid by grocery stores to take
their old produce that they were
throwing away so they didn't get it for
free they got paid to take it and then
they took it to a warehouse off I-15 and
they stacked it up and they bought a
bunch of sawdust mixed it in turned it
around and they made organic highquality
compost that they sold to grocery stores
all over the country and then they sold
to a major multic conglomerate okay
here's my question what's up so I get it
I get the negative cogs for that
business the eco-friendly business
because composting is just inherently
faster than drying out this wood but
there is a significant outlay of costs
in the form of Labor to go and pick up
this wood maybe you have to cut it you
can have to bring it back to somewhere
you're gonna have to stack
it and then there's a per there's a long
period of time I don't know how long it
is in between Gathering the wood and the
wood being cured I don't know what do
they call it when it's like ready to be
smoked there's a very long period of

[13:00]
smoked there's a very long period of
time if you have one of these portable
kils how long is the Kil like how long
it take with the it's like a it's like a
day or two that's the whole idea short
yeah how much do they
cost 20 grand this is significantly
faster than the composting idea because
you can't speed that up that takes
months agreed I hear that do you put the
wood in and then you take the wood out
two days later or does it have to sit in
there and until you sell it does that
make sense what I'm asking let's say you
get this a raw Branch right you got to
cut it up into log sizes and then you
got to split it and they have hydraulic
Splitters pump it through there you have
like you know chunks of wood and then
you take that finished product and it's
way too wet to smoke you put it in that
form in the Kil dry it out pull it out
and it's ready to sell to a barbecue
restaurant so to launch a business like
this you'd have to do two things the
first thing you'd have to do is contact
tree trimmers and say like hey can I
come and pick up your tree

[14:01]
come and pick up your tree
trimmings the second thing you'd have to
do is so let that be like your supplier
and then the second thing you'd have to
do is find a business that would buy
from
you
right is it any wood is it any wood are
like you no it's not any wood but I have
a I have an answer for that okay all
right if you are watching this clip
right now you are watching this on
YouTube and if you are a fan of podcast
please check out my podcast while you're
at it because sometimes I have podcasts
that aren't on YouTube and sometimes I
have YouTubes that aren't on podcast so
check out the ker office on any podcast
platform or you can go to TKO pod.com
also my newsletter will throw that in
there there are no ads It's weekly it's
different content than my podcast and
YouTube newsletter. chrisj cerner.com
You'll see the link and we'll see you
there let's say it's a pine tree okay so
I know you're not an outdoorsy guy but I
kind of am there's two types of wood out
there oh my gosh I'm sorry you're an
outdoorsy guy are you try me I've been
Outdoors today twice
[Laughter]

[15:01]
[Laughter]
two types of wood hardwood soft wood
okay
hardwood oak tree softwood pine tree
BSA sure Birch sure mahogany I get it
sure and so you're only smoking
Hardwoods by the way Hickory and pean
same thing by the way it's the same
thing that you didn't know that I didn't
know that let's say you cut down a pine
tree you put that in the Mulcher and you
chip it up you could sell it as mulch um
or there's actually a massive
aftermarket for selling like stumps and
larger pieces of wood to Woodworkers
that they can use with a lathe to make
bowls or to tables like you saying this
idea makes me excited to do it because
I'm like why would we not do that that
sounds like an amazing idea but then the
inevitable question that we always ask
is like okay well then why is nobody
doing it at scale at this point people
are doing this so we have a big tree
triming competitor in Richardson that

[16:02]
triming competitor in Richardson that
sells a ton of firewood we haven't even
talked about that a ton of firewood in
Dallas Texas of all places I don't even
think they sell like barbecue smoking
wood but they're vertically integrated
both on site they have tree trimming
business firewood business right there
the difference is this new technology
right this enabling technology opens up
a whole new industry for more people to
do this without having
a bunch of acreage a bunch of equipment
a bunch more
capex before this airs we need to get in
touch with the company who who has that
because agreed this could be a perfuma
situation I'm one step ahead of you my
friend you always are my
boy so it's not an easy business it's
sweaty you're driving around you're it's
hot like it's not passive it's not easy
but I love love love like I have like
this bucket list of business ideas that
I love right that I want like you know

[17:01]
I love right that I want like you know
I'm going to own a barbecue restaurant
one day I don't care that it's a bad
idea I don't care it's probably going to
fail I'm going to do it okay you're not
gonna stop
me I love the idea of I don't even know
if negative cogs is the right way to say
it it's a yeah it is negative cogs
that's exactly what it is it's negative
cogs because you're getting paid to take
it I want to own a business like that
where you get paid to take something and
then you sell it I also think and I
don't know if you thought about this
but you could have a
business that is just calling into
individual markets all right I'm going
to do Oklahoma City and I'm going to
find three people who could
become you know what would you call this
business Quicky wood quickie smokey all
right hey do you want to be the Quicky
Smokey guy for Oklahoma City and they
say yes and it's like okay here's the
business in the Box buy this shipping
container and then I will show you how
to go out and get all the business that

[18:01]
to go out and get all the business that
you want from all these tree trimming
companies and like you could contact a
tree trimming business and then give
them the business in a box that shows
them how to generate the leads in order
to convert them so that they can have
the quickie smoker but I think that
there would be a cool component to that
as well with the education piece and
selling these units yeah you know what
it reminds me of is LCD cycle I did not
enjoy negative cogs with LCD cycle but
LCD cycle was me
when I say me I mean three virtual
assistants in the Philippines me calling
up iPhone repair shops saying hey you
have a box of broken iPhone screens can
I have them right and it could not have
been a negative cogs business because I
had competitors and there was a market
for these if I was the only guy in town
then theoretically I could have said hey
this is e-w recycling would you like to
pay me to properly dispose of it so I
can get it back into the into the
circulation right so but that's that's
why we grew so fast is because
it's a foot in the door business we got

[19:00]
it's a foot in the door business we got
our foot in the door by giving them a
no-brainer stupid easy offer which is
let me pay you to take your trash I pay
you to take your trash who would say no
to that okay cool now we have a
relationship we have trust we've
exchanged money then you call them up
again and say hey why don't you buy
parts for me as well it's a great model
and so here we go Nick here we go I just
thought of
something you get your fit TD you get
your foot the door by
saying don't pay dump fees anymore you
know what sell your chipper sell your
trucks I would never tell a true Ching
business to do that but this you know
we're trying to make good content here
right it doesn't need to be it doesn't
need to be I mean come on it doesn't
need true or verifiable or I've got
oversimplify this for more clicks no but
it's like don't pay the dump anymore
we'll take your stuff for free okay yeah
I'm going to be at 123 Maple tomorrow
come pick it up we'll be done by 2: p.m.
cool you get their trust you get their

[20:01]
cool you get their trust you get their
relationship and then Nick it's right in
front of us look you looking at me I
need your eye contact you looking at me
oh yes hey who's grinding your
stumps did we just come full
circle who says no to that offer once we
already have a working vendor
relationship oh my gosh who's going to
say no I don't know sociopath nobody
it's a good offer Rich dmer
maybe seriously it's the it could be the
same
business yeah it's a great offer I love
it I'm telling you everyone's everyone's
talking about Home Services no one's
talking about B2B Home Services but I'm
I'm in on
it I call it homeboy
Services you know what I'm saying yeah
call up your homeboy get some Services
just moham Mohamed please edit that I
got I got that one Chris don't worry
about it okay what you got dude so I had
a conversation with beard today he is

[21:03]
a conversation with beard today he is
goes on Twitter on Twitter as the Sultan
of storage I don't even know how to say
his last name let me look it up no
nobody does bar Klein Smith oh yeah welc
oh Klein Smith that's is good no yeah
that's good and like his story was
incredible to me so he started he lives
in Durango Colorado so it's beautiful
mountains skiing mountain biking all
that stuff and he's like went to college
and the only thing I optimized for was
being outdoors so like I got a business
management degree but really I just
spent all of my time Outdoors hiking
biking skiing all that stuff he
graduates from college and he needs a
job he's like I had a degree in business
management and there just happened to be
this company in town that was hiring he
had a bad opinion of them because he's
like they always had ads so I was like
what's their deal why do they have so
much turnover but I needed a job so I
applied turns out that was like the only
tech company in Durango

[22:01]
tech company in Durango
Colorado he gets hired on there that
tech company ends up becoming more than
a billion dollar company selling
Upstream to I don't even remember who
they sold to but he ends up getting a
ton of experience over the years he ends
up being there from like 2005 to
2016 and was a part of works his way up
does exceptionally well was a part of
the team that negotiated the sale had
Equity has an exit and then he's sitting
on like $3 million of capital he decides
okay I got to put this to work I'm not
done working so he does all of his
research and he falls in love with self
storage and over the last four years
he's put $ 1.8 I think million dollars
of his own money to work and that 1.8
has
purchased $21 million of real estate now
obviously there's debt on top of that
right but he's probably after
appreciation yes no no no no no no no
that was the that was like the purchase
of the real estate amount yeah yeah his
basis so he bought really really well
well it's obviously appreciated since

[23:00]
well it's obviously appreciated since
then and he's cash flowing I don't know
$3 to $400,000 a year to himself after
debt servicing and now he's kind of
looking outside of that because he's
like I have all of these passive losses
and so I want to get passive income so
that I can offset it so that's why he
started this
latam virtual agency and and all this
other stuff but anyways he was talking
to me and he told me the story about how
he bought this facility for a 2.8 cap
$12 million 2.8 cap and I was like dude
that's fascinating what tell me about it
he's like well it was here in Durango I
knew the rents were undervalued I knew
that it was under occupied and it was
like a it's an Institutional type of
investment I don't know what that means
but it must be like big and nice he's
like so I just I knew I could turn it
around like oh really he's like yeah so
I I thought it could get to a place
where it was doing like $1.8 million a
year in
noi and if I just made some tweaks I
could kind of get get it there but it
was the biggest deal he'd ever done he

[24:00]
was the biggest deal he'd ever done he
sold another property in order to buy it
kind of like leveraged everything so he
buys it for 12 million it's a 2.8 cap
and within like the last
year this last month it did $130,000 in
noi so it's already now at like 1.6 1.7
million a year in noi there's still a
lot of room left to run on it he thinks
he's going to get to like 2 million in
noi and he's like I think it's
conservatively valued at like $17
million right now that story just got me
thinking about this concept that I
really like which is like the fat pitch
and Warren Buffett talks about it he's
like okay when you get the pitch you got
to take a swing and Warren Buffett
historically does 10 Investments a year
whereas a lot of fund managers will do
hundreds of Investments a year but his
Investments are very concentrated and he
puts a lot of money behind them because
he's waiting for his fat pitch he's like
I stay in my buy box I know exactly what
I'm trying to do but when I get that
opportunity I go big in it and be to me
was like this living example of someone
who was like okay my fat pitch came he

[25:02]
who was like okay my fat pitch came he
had generated all this experience in the
tech World he's sitting on mountain of
cash he gets some experience by buying
these facilities and then a facility
crosses his desk that is in his backyard
so he knows the market he finally has
some operational chops so he understands
what he needs to do to turn it around
and he has the capital in order to take
it down so to anybody else like you and
I was like dude you paid a 2.8 cap for a
$12 million facility it's like dude that
is so risky but for him he's looking at
this he's like no man this is my pitch
I've been waiting for this pitch he goes
all in on it he's nervous he's scared
and it is so far at least worked out
really really well for him and I just
continue to be obsessed with this idea
of when the right opportunity comes that
only you can take advantage of you
should swing really hard anyways so that
was the story with bar that's a great
story I it reminds me of our Waco Park
different outcome same entry right
because we bought that park at a one cap
knowing exactly what the Playbook is

[26:01]
knowing exactly what the Playbook is
going to be after we bought it we bought
it we executed The Playbook and it
worked period also reminds me of like
perfume adct with the or perfum
vending.com
where you have a lot of experience with
marketing and then we also have
experience with relationships with
suppliers in China and the operational
understanding of what it's like to ship
products from China and then distribute
that in the United States and then like
there was there aren't many people in
this space who would be able to do the
things that we've done with perfum
vending.com with you know to Post Drive
the interest and then have the expertise
to fulfill on the back end that's an
example of it as well I just think it's
I think more of us should be waiting for
the fat pitches as opposed to like oh
shiny object oh shiny object oh Shin
Like if you can stay disciplined it is
such a better strategy for growth yeah I
think the difference there is like what
is our fat pitch I don't know like like

[27:02]
is our fat pitch I don't know like like
I think there's a difference between a
fat pitch and a white whale like a white
whale doesn't have to be a fat pitch but
sometimes it is I'm trying to think of a
time when like I just pushed all the
chips in to me la like launching mining
Syndicate was a fat
pitch because it it was also very
similar in the sense that okay you had
to get Chinese supplier
relationships I don't know that we've
necessarily though had a true fat pitch
yet it it feels to me like the per
perfum vending.com is is one those fat
pitches where it's like we got to make
that work it's like let's go hard on it
and let's go all in and it and we have
we've been investing in it we have a
team around it we're building an
infrastructure we're negotiating with
the manufacturer like it we're doing it
and six months from now we may be able
to look back and say that was a fat
pitch I'm glad we took advantage of it
and update August we're up to 58 Grand
in
Revenue four 45% gross margins pretty
solid net margins so and we're not
pushing yeah we're just hopping on calls
we're slow playing it right now because
we're we're still trying to tread

[28:01]
we're we're still trying to tread
lightly with this stuff so yeah I can't
wait for that update in six months it's
gonna be fun one I love it yeah I love
fat pitches I love white whales it's
funny because you don't when you are
chasing shiny objects like I've been
doing you're better able to see
opportunities because of that cross
referencing right totally so Warren
Buffett got the fat pitch analogy from
Ted Williams Ted Williams was the
greatest baseball hitter of all time and
he developed it because he knew exactly
wear in the strike zone he had the
highest probability of hitting the ball
and so he was like oh that's my fat
pitch I'm waiting for my fat pitch how
did Ted Williams learn that hundreds of
thousands of reps like hundreds of
thousands of swings and hits that over
time he iterates to and he's like okay
this is my zone of Genius I know that
when the pitch comes in this area like
I'm gonna go hard on it so for you and I
yes lots of shiny object and we can sit
here and be like oh man these guys are
so distracted but there is a muscle that
you build up in kind of semi- pursuing a

[29:02]
you build up in kind of semi- pursuing a
lot of these Endeavors that allows you
then to see like oh I've done this 17
times I know for a fact this one's gonna
hit so so like you have to get the Reps
in in order to recognize the fat pitch
it's not just about sitting on your
hands dude I want to get a t-shirt made
that just says compounding doesn't care
right if you're all in on one thing
that's awesome you're going to crush it
if you're having shiny object syndrome
that's awesome you're going to crush
crush it it doesn't matter compounding
doesn't care it's like gravity gravity
doesn't care if you drop a brick or a
feather it's going to fall your
experiences will keep compounding you
just have to stay in the game like if
you stay in the game it doesn't really
matter what you do maybe outcome a you
make more money or out can be the truth
is you'll never know you will never know
you can't AB test your life no right so
just do what is fun and what pays the
bills I love that I also want to get a
shirt made that says I love fat pitches
and just like a picture of a woman on

[30:00]
and just like a picture of a woman on
there that's a little edit this out is
that not where you were going with that
we're going to power through
it it's funny because the fat pitch
there's two types there's like a
financial fat pitch and then there's
like a Time fat pitch and then you could
do both right and it feels like we're
doing a a time commitment fat pitch with
content because it's all encompassing
like content is a business that could
launch any business it's we're building
a foundation and it feels feel very much
like a time commitment fat pitch it is
costly we're a net negative on our
content we have people helping us edit
and post and all that it's a fat pitch
nonetheless yeah that's what's been this
will be the last thing I say on it is
like doing our podcasts how many
episodes have you done and release
now 40 something 50 something yeah we're
in the 50s so like each of us have done
we've had a hundred conversations with
people like we're getting so much
exposure to what is out there and what
is possible and seeing all these

[31:00]
is possible and seeing all these
different pieces that could work in
different places and building out a
network that when the fat pitch does
come because we've laid all this
groundwork people are going to look at
it and be like dude that must be nice
freaking overnight but all the hours all
the time spent researching building up
that muscle so that you could then take
advantage of the opportunity that's what
I think a lot of people Miss is they
discount the amount of reps that people
put in and then they overemphasize the
short nature of their success when it
it's neither one of those that that they
truly are understanding yeah agreed so
with that in mind I want you to help me
brainstorm something so yes my last
podcast well by the time this airs it
won't be my last but my podcast with the
Shelf dude what the Shelf dude did if
you didn't hear this episode is he saw a
Facebook ad for garage shells he thought
I need those in my garage let me build
them myself he did and he thought huh I
could sell these just like someone sold
them to me and he posted it to Facebook

[32:00]
them to me and he posted it to Facebook
it went well he made five grand a month
working 16 hour days he had a 95 quit
his job went all in now he's making 15
grand a month doing something that
doesn't scale okay because these things
cannot be shipped he sells plans for 10
20 bucks on his website he has an
Instagram account with 55,000 followers
but mostly you know 80% of his revenue
is coming from building and delivering
custom shelving benches and all that
it's like mostly garage shelves right
okay yeah cool so I love this because
it's hyperlocal and it quote doesn't
scale okay so I love the idea of finding
opportunities like this opportunities
that many if not most people look down
on because it's not something you want
to talk about at a dinner party it's not
sexy like no one wants to be delivering
a couch 30 miles away for a $200 profit
right like no one wants to do that it
doesn't scale it's big it's bulky I love
the concept
of doing this Mak making decent money in
it um documenting it on social media and

[33:01]
it um documenting it on social media and
then like being very free and open and
this is exactly what Alex did from the
Shelf dude so I'm just like copying what
what he's already done being very free
and open with everything that you're
doing hey come compete against me and
that that's kind of your hook right
that's your whole brand is like compete
against me come compete against me come
compete because like No One's Gonna want
a shelf delivered from Orum to Los
Angeles so just finding that thing
making good money at doing that thing
documenting that thing and then having
people fly to you in person and charging
them a pretty penny to show them exactly
how to do that thing where they are so
what you're saying is find something
hyperlocal
non-scalable and then document your
journey on social media that gets
awareness out there builds trust with
people and then essentially turn it into
a course is that like what you're like
yeah like something in person though
yeah I mean specifically in person I
know we recoil at the course word but

[34:00]
know we recoil at the course word but
right a training so a lot of this stuff
is like not new or Innovative right
courses are not new doing things that
don't scale is not new documenting your
journey on social media that's I'm not
inventing any of this but putting all
these pieces together look really
interesting because what Alex can do now
is he can be a lead gen source for all
of these people around the country or
world that want these shelves and so
someone from Miami reaches out he could
build a programmatic SEO s like garage
shelving.com or something someone in
Miami says Hey I want those says okay
yeah we'll give you a call he sells that
lead for 50 bucks to the guy in Miami
that already paid him five grand to
learn how to build those shelves and so
he's profiting up front and then he's
profiting over time as he sells those
leads to the same people that he taught
in person rinse and repeat with any
industry
basically there's a guy that does this
with epoxy flooring he started with an
epoxy flooring store uh just literally
selling epoxy flooring material
and then he got active on social media

[35:00]
and then he got active on social media
now he hosts these in-person trainings
of how to start your own epoxy flooring
business and so he makes really good
money from that and then he's makes even
more money over time as he sells them
the epoxy flooring they don't have to
buy from him they do but here's my
question when I hear the way you're
explaining it it sound like it just
sounds to me like kind of what we make
fun of people doing on Twitter where hey
I started a cleaning company I got it to
$20,000 a month in revenue and then you
use that credit ability to then sell a
course like the the business becomes
selling the business information as
opposed to the cleaning business am I
misreading what you're saying is that
the idea of what yeah pretty much a lot
of those like remote cleaning things the
whole angle there is like like the sex
appeal of selling something remotely
right like own a remote cleaning
business without having to do anything
whereas this is like very much unsexy
like flipping couches repairing
appliances apoc flooring it's something
where you are the

[36:01]
where you are the
operator okay yeah so you're not selling
the dream or the Allure of passive
income you're like literally teaching
people almost like a trade like hey this
is how you gather this is how you buy
back Electronics door too and then sell
it on eBay or any other of those ideas
that you could possibly do
locally it's just interesting what like
the internet has enabled you know we're
30 plus years into this and like
teaching has always been the lowest paid
profession one of the lowest paid
professions and it sucks because it's
such an important thing but with the
internet that's like flipped on its head
right with just look at YouTubers alone
they're just teaching right like Mr
Beast is teaching people how to survive
on an island by themselves for seven
days and it's there's entertainment
involved there's a lot of entertainment
but now today like teachers that have
found out how to scale their skills are
making more than 99% of the population
can I flip your
idea a little bit on its head because it

[37:02]
idea a little bit on its head because it
duv Tails into one of my ideas that I
wanted to talk about today yeah I'm I'm
done with that one do you know who
chanler Reed is uhhuh yep boot camp yep
yeah okay so for those who don't know s
SMB boot camp basically they put on
these boot camps several times a year in
I think Tampa Bay Florida and then when
people come in it's a live Workshop boot
camp and they have speakers come in who
are industry experts they'll probably
have some somebody who knows the who's a
lawyer that can help them with their
purchase agreement somebody who knows
the due diligence who can do the quality
of earning somebody who knows financing
who's a banker somebody who knows
operations that can actually help with
the transition right so they come in
they speak and they educate a lot of
these people but as I was talking to
them a couple weeks ago I had them on my
podcast and I was like why don't you do
boot camps in like Salt Lake or Southern
California or Minnesota like Florida's
kind of out of the way I live in Boise
it would probably take me 10 hours of
travel to get to Tampa Bay part of

[38:00]
travel to get to Tampa Bay part of
that's because Boise has a terrible
airport and part of that is because
Florida is just really far from Boise so
I started having this idea and it kind
of dovetails on what you're saying is
could there be a business where in local
markets you take live courses like the
SMB boot camp and say Hey I want to
license that from you I'm going to hold
a boot camp here in Boise I will find
the speaker like I have your curriculum
so I'll find the finance person the qov
person the the operations person then
the lawyer I will organize and host the
event I'll cut you a percentage because
you've already created the material but
I have the network here and then you
Market it and you get people from the
west coast to essentially come in and
and attend that SMB boot camp and then
you pay them a percentage you keep the
rest and you know that's the business I
love it I mean the hard part is having
the expertise right like the hard part
is having a life worth teaching about

[39:00]
is having a life worth teaching about
okay most people just don't fit that
mold period and the then the second
hardest part is having to grind out all
of that content once you've done that it
becomes fairly easy right easy in
quotations and so if you can find
someone like Chandler who's lived that
life he has the expertise and he's done
all the the hard work of assemblying the
content then you can leverage his
expertise and his content and give him
20% and for him it's just a bonus
because these are this is stuff that he
wouldn't have captured anyway yeah I
mean and you can think of a version of
this being done with the tree Ching Boot
Camp or cleaning company Boot Camp or a
coding boot camp like any boot camp that
you can think of that has a live
in-person component to it which I think
that many boot camps even though there
are virtual options many people prefer
the live and in
person if you could figure out a way to
build that Network locally and then
reach out to somebody who has a
successful boot camp to then license it
that would be really cool again
hyperlocal education-based content
business I love it okay what you think

[40:01]
business I love it okay what you think
of those ideas please share it with a
friend if they come to mind as you
listen to it and leave me a review I
would really appreciate that because I
don't really ask for it and I don't have
a lot on the App Store so it'd be good
to get some more have a great day
