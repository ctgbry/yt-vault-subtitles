[00:00]
so this guy has sold 20 $30 million of sugar
water on Amazon and so naturally I posted on
Twitter and then this anon account pops in
dude and he's like it's not that easy and
he put a chip on my shoulder i was like
dude it is that easy and so then I woke
up the next morning and I launched
hummingbirdfood.co i literally built
the whole thing in like 12 minutes it's
not just like a free offer to entice him
to check out $14 all AI generated 100%
i'm gonna do it and y'all can do it too
my mom texted me my mom texted me a couple weeks
ago probably about a month ago at this point and
she sends me this picture of the kitchen counter
at their house and she's got a bag of sugar and
a pot of water and a hummingbird feeder and
she goes it was like in our family group chat
and she goes "It's hummingbird season i'm making
homemade hummingbird nectar right and I was like

[01:01]
"Oh all right like what does that mean?" And she
goes "You put sugar in water and boil it and then
it is hummingbird nectar it's like super That's it
it's sugar." I was like "It's sugar it's sugar."
I was like "That's crazy." Like I if it was me I
just pop on Amazon you know and be like "Dude I'm
just going to buy some hummingbird nectar." It's
sugar water basically it's very thick kind of like
a syrup yeah yeah basically it's it's just sugar
water technically it's it's one part sugar four
parts water whatever amount you want to do that
with i pop on Amazon just to see you know as we do
just like to explore i come across a few listings
of people selling hummingbird nectar and you can
buy it pre-made in the jug you get 64 ounces of
this it's It's sugar water like let's cut to the
chase sugar water and they're selling a 60 I think
it's 64 ounces for like 11 bucks right and I click

[02:01]
on the listing and it it says 80,000 people have
bought this more than once wow okay now that's
like just Amazon is showing you that or a third
party tool just Amazon just Amazon straight up
more than once 80,000 people have bought it more
than once they have 24,000 reviews on the product
real quick they're buying it in a powdered form
so are they just buying sugar no no no they're
buying the premixed water they're buying a jug
like they're buying the premixed and it's loaded
it's crap it's loaded with preservatives and all
this stuff cuz you know sugar and water left out
just causes mold and bacteria whatever well okay
so 24,000 reviews on Amazon right on average 1%
of Amazon purchasers leave a review 24 2.4
million purchases at an $11 price point so

[03:01]
this 26 million has sold 20 $30 million of sugar
water on Amazon sugar water and so naturally I
take a screenshot of it and I post it on Twitter
and I say just an FYI as a reminder this guy and
I forget the number i think it was like maybe
10,000 people had bought it or 20,000 people had
bought it in the last 30 days and so I was like
there's somebody making a quart million dollars
a month selling sugar water on the internet mhm
and then this Anon account pops in dude and he's
like "It's not that easy." And he put a chip on
your shoulder and he put a chip on my shoulder
i was like "Dude it is that easy." Yeah and so I
outlined exactly what I would do if I was going
to launch this in that tweet right the bag the
sugar the whole thing and it just sat wrong with

[04:00]
me for like 12 hours and so then I woke up the
next morning and I launched hummingbirdfood.co
did you leave the tweet up oh the tweets up
i can find it and so I used AI chatgpt i I
designed the bag so I'm selling nectar mix which
is I'll be so real i say it on the website too
it's just sugar in a bag branded as hummingbird
neck it's just sugar i literally go down to the
Smart and Final which is the local grocery store
and I buy 50 lb bags of sugar for $39.97 i take
a scooper and a bucket and I load these bags
in my garage and then I got a little $20 heat
sealer on Amazon so I heat seal them i pack them
i've got I've got probably 120 pounds of sugar
in the back of my Jeep right now to drop off at
UPS later this is so And so I start running ads i

[05:03]
download mockup of the pouch i give it to ChatGpt
and I say "Hey generate you know a woman holding
this generate this laying on a table generate
all these different scenes all these different
product photos i turn those into ads." I use
Solo Drop to build the store and I launch the
ads facebook Instagram Facebook just Facebook yeah
just meta just like all meta products okay let's
get let's get tactical are you only in the news
feed stories just let Facebook ride just let it
ride dude i just put the just put the creatives in
there advantage placement sure i don't even really
remember i just run ABO's what is [ __ ] adset
budget optimization and so okay you can either
do an [ __ ] or a CBO it's basically like where
do you want Facebook to distribute spend and so I
generally run So here's how this works i make you
free videos i actually know what I'm talking about
i have no greasy sales pitch at the end and if you
implement what I talk about you'll make a lot more
money and have a better life and all I ask for in
return is that you hit the subscribe button and

[06:02]
maybe even the notification bell just like that
thank you i like running two campaigns each with
adsets within them that are ABOS and so I have a
testing campaign and I have a winning campaign and
then I'll go launch new sets of ads on the testing
campaign ABOS so I'll put in I don't know let's
just say five ad creatives at $100 a day on an
[ __ ] meaning Facebook will decide which of those
ads get the most spend because inherently Facebook
is incent incentivized to spend your money the
best so that you continue to spend them they want
to push the content that's performing the best
yeah just launched a quick little [ __ ] a couple
of the ads classic paro principle a couple of the
ads perform way better than the others i moved
them into ad sets in the in the winning campaign
to scale and let it ride oh my gosh okay well dude
like what was your cost per acquisition what are

[07:03]
we talking and you're welcome to share your screen
too if you want to get real nitty-gritty yeah yeah
I will so I really want to show people the ad side
because it's like this is the stuff that's super
popular so I've done about $5,000 in sales in two
and a half weeks okay people are buying them i've
spent about So that's a six figure business yeah
yeah like if I was really going to go run and gun
at this and so gross margin between the bags and
the sugar cost me about three bucks or something
around those lines to to produce a unit not
including any labor or shipping that's just
me messing around in the garage yeah so like it
yeah very bare bones like let's just see if this
works packaging labeling raw materials COGS cost
of goods sold is three bucks cogs is yeah like 351
or or something along those lines selling them
for 18 bucks you get two pounds of sugar for 18
bucks and so the math is roughly like 80% gross
margin and I'm only selling them as multiacks

[08:05]
for those listening if you want a CPG a consumer
packaged goods product to sell on a Shopify store
through Facebook or Instagram ads you really got
to start with a 70 80% gross margin you just have
to i don't care what the product is it's almost
impossible like you're not going to do it on a 30%
margin right and similarly like AOV is less than
30 just like mathematically hard like you got to
get north of 50 yeah even if you're selling like
a $1,000 mattress like Casper style your cost per
acquisition is probably going to be like 400 bucks
300 bucks so that thing's got to cost like 200
bucks yeah 100% once you get through the first two
like week or two of ads you start to get a pretty
good feel for what's good and so I was able to get
up to like a a one and a halfx rorowaz mostly cuz

[09:00]
I stopped selling single packs that was the one
big learning was like I got to I got to sell two
of these specifically because the thing that's
killing hummingbirds right now is shipping like
we should actually talk about the shipping stuff
because like me shipping six pounds of sugar from
Los Angeles to Tennessee is costing me a fortune
dude it's insane how much are you spending on
shipping average is like 12 bucks a shipment which
hurts dude what are you shipping in a poly bag box
boxes unless it's a one pack then I ship it in a
poly and how much does the product weigh one a one
pack yeah it's they're 2 lb each like 1.8 lb each
again I'm not even I'm not using a ship station
i'm not getting any discount pricing like any any
of those things but what I was able to prove is
that people will buy hummingbird nectar on the
internet that's well branded at a reasonable

[10:03]
rorowaz like I'm not mad at that it's a super
seasonal business for sure may to September like
when I did you know classic you go to Jungle Scout
and you use that to to look at the Amazon stuff
like all of the purchases that are happening for
any of the competitors on Amazon are it's May to
September for the most part right like hummingbird
season right so your cost acquisition is going
to go way down yeah presumably yeah that's the
that is the the hope and so the shipping is its
own thing but COGS will also continue to drop as I
order more volume specifically on the bag side cuz
I only ordered 250 which is if anyone is starting
to do some sleuththing the reason there's no ads
running right now is I ran out of inventory and
have to wait for them to ship me more bags that
COGS will will drop shipping i have to like if I
could even just cut the shipping expense in half
my math was You will and so I just texted Kirk to
see like what that should cost and I think it's
like as low as four or $5 and I'm open like I like
whatever needs to go down to be able to drop that

[11:07]
cost if it's moving to a 3PL in Texas like fine
like I'm in right like whatever needs to go down
you should also experiment with dropping your
product weight to like 15 ounces that way it
can still be under 16 with a poly bag because
that's 16 ounces is a cut off for first class
shipping and it's it's the difference between
like $8 and like $4 like 1.1 lb verse 15 ounces
is literally like it's twice as much so smaller
bags yeah and you even if you need to drop the
price to compensate but then your cars will go
down too yeah yeah and cuz I'm selling multiacks
AOV will go up cuz I just started doing that where
like you can't you can't buy one anymore but I've
been with that of I want to drop Yeah dropping
from cuz it's 2 lbs right now like they're heavy

[12:00]
like like dude I'm sweating walking in and out
of the UPS dude like it's it's a bunch of trips
with a bunch of weight everything you described I
could hear a hater writing in the comments "What
are you just going to go to the grocery store buy
a 50 lb bag of sugar and then go online and buy
some packaging with a $20 heat sealer and then
put up a solar drop and you Yes $5,000 of sales
in its first 21 days." Yes that's exactly what I
did dude i filmed the whole thing pop in the pop
in the the link in my Twitter bio dude and you can
watch me do it i literally filmed the entire thing
and so gosh but yeah it's literally it's sitting
there lauren thinks I'm absolutely insane i'm out
there in the garage for two hours once a week just
scooping sugar i know that's what I said dude and
then I'm on Amazon you can buy like you can buy
machines that you just pour the sugar in you press
a button and it automatically dispenses 15 ounces
out the slot and I was like "Dude it's only 1,200

[13:00]
bucks can I put one in the garage?" And he goes
"No." I was like "One might show up dude i don't
know." But yeah and then I'm just going to go to a
baking mix manufacturer or c-acker and say "Yeah I
want to do a custom baking mix." And they're going
to be like "Awesome what are you making you want
like cookies or like you know a cake mix?" I'm
like "No no no no just sugar just sugar in a bag
would be sick." And so then they'll handle that
and what I've realized is this summer is going
to be a total testing i'm only going to go direct
consumer next summer you'll see me on Amazon like
you'll catch your boy i was like "Dude I think
I can do I think I can do a million dollars a
year on this." Of course you could you would have
like 1% of the market if I can get 10 to 20% ebida
margin like for four months of the year I make an
extra 100 200k selling sugar i'm going to do it
and y'all could do it too i'm just I'm just going
to do it like I've just decided all the skills you

[14:00]
pick up in the process of optimizing your Facebook
ads and launching a Shopify store like you can use
those skills across so many other businesses
sharpen the sword dude like it's why when like
on the past episodes I've always been like "Yo you
guys should just go launch digital product Shopify
stores." Mhm like because you'll just learn you'll
learn how to run ads on easy mode with zero COG
zero shipping like you're not going to have to
deal with all the stuff that I'm dealing with in
terms of operating an e-commerce brand you just
get to send an email as your fulfillment you get
to play with offers and you get to understand
what makes things work and you like I'm in the
middle of doing one of those right now because I'm
annoyed that I got to ship units i'm like I'm just
going to launch a digital product and see if I can
do the same thing like you get more flexibility on
it i can't charge $60 for a 2 lb bag of sugar
but you can charge 70 60 70 bucks for a very
niche specific digital product that solves a very
specific painoint yeah for sure like we watch it

[15:05]
happen all the time what do you think you're going
to be able to get your cost per acquisition down
through Facebook ads too we've had days times
campaigns that I'm getting purchases for like
14 bucks which works on a because my AOV has has
been hovering at like 45 to 50 thanks to my incart
bump offer which is hummingbird attraction 101
the ebook for 14 bucks $0 cogs pushes my AOV up
56% of people so they're paying for that it's not
just like a free offer to entice them to check out
$14 $14 a generated 100% it helps well and then
you set your you set your free shipping threshold
to incentivize that add-on in cart oh my gosh
and so how many minutes of prompting did it take
to make that ebook dude I did it during like the
first quarter of the Lakers playoffs game a couple

[16:00]
weeks ago like I think I literally built the whole
thing in like 12 minutes oh my gosh the prompt is
easy dude it says "I want to write a book about
this write a detailed outline of 10 chapters 12
chapters whatever it is that's the key right then
they write the outline you got to do the outline
then you got to take it one at a time then write
chapter one sweet and now write chapter two all
in the same chat so it knows the reference and
and builds it all out i've done that a bunch
of times i got a digital product that's just
sitting in my back pocket that I got to launch
that I did that on and so Oh my gosh here's the
the reality of it is all V1s all of this is V1s
like it's not like I'm going to go sling this
AI book forever it's like if people are actually
buying it yes I will take the three days and
like actually try to make it good like for sure
but like I'm not going to go do all of that work
until I know people want it why would I let's go
if the market tells me they want it I will build
it none of this build it and they will come stuff

[17:04]
dude it's like no no no you come to me you tell
me you'll pay for it sick then I'll build it
absolutely build it and they probably won't come
sell it first and you know they are coming before
you and you know what to build because they you
know what to build yeah like I see so many people
doing it the flip dude it's crazy but the more
people that listen to this the less the fewer
people doing that look listen get rich that's
right baby you know so video is cool but you
know what's better long form audio via podcast and
my newsletter tkopod.com go there to subscribe for
free to my newsletter it's one email a week very
tactical and then go to my audio podcast three
episodes a week stuff like this you're gonna love
it all free no sleazy sales pitch tkopod.com all
right so I got a paid account for exploding topics
and anyone listening to this if you're not if
you're not watching I'll describe what I'm showing
but these are technology topics sorted by growth

[18:01]
from the last three months and they're at like the
quote exploding part of their growth cycle not at
peak not at regular first of all if you're like
an ADHD like idea addict this is like the best
thing you could do so let's brainstorm real quick
some like ebook ideas that you could generate with
JGBT and sell that matches some of these topics
that we're seeing so I'm just going to name out
loud some of the ones that look interesting to
me robotic lawnmower okay interesting let's see
i don't know what a lot of these are inflatable
screen projector cool huh that's interesting
let's see portable neck fan lovable exploding oh
yeah there you go maybe like a a $19 ebook on like
lovable hacks yeah or a $99 how to build X app yep
or maybe like a So mini portable air conditioner

the summers dude the summer stuff too i know it
is like lawnmowing and Yep air conditioning let's
go out lot of lot of SEO type searches do you see
all those there a lot of off page on page a bunch
of people searching for stuff like that let's do
that let's do this health and wellness okay let's
do time frame one year because then it won't be
seasonal let's look at growth exploding let's do
non-brands so dumbbell bracelets so weight almost
like uh Dude that's so good you know how people
have like ankle ankle weights you just rebrand

[20:01]
those as wrist weights pdrn mask a skincare
product designed to improve skin firmness and
elasticity while promoting a youthful comp you
can't tell me people wouldn't buy that anything i
like I like the rye serum eyebrow eyebrow specific
i like that a lot skinare product designed for
eyebrow i'm just going to tell some people what's
good real quick is that cool yep okay so eyebrow
serum you're going to go to suppl.com okay they
have two separate products one that is a peptide
hair serum the other is they have two different
hair serum products that you can go and brand and
essentially just white label they'll do all your

Canva put that on the template that Suppl gives

Manager bing bang boom get your ads live
oh filtered shower head dude I just bought one of
those loneliness epidemic is booming yep mop soap
we need special soap for mops now dude dude you
do you have to you never You Dude I can't believe
breathing necklace a device worn like jewelry
that helps control breath my gosh what it just
it blows my mind what people pay for lymphatic
drainage is a big one that's talking about the
massage but like a lot I dude I I spend a lot of
time talking about the difference between offers

[22:00]
and vehicles and I think people get them confused
dude right and so like dude when you think about
like an offer right I'll use B2B just I feel like
more people listening but you if if you're talking
about B2B your offer generally is we're either
going to help you make more money save time or
save money right like those are the the worlds
that you live in that's what people are paying
for at the as the end result of what you're doing
so then you back that into like a service right
or or a a a method so we'll say like we help you
automate your business mhm to save time and make
more money now that's a that's an offer right now
there's multiple vehicles that that offer can live
in right like you can launch that as a service we
will do automation for you for X amount per month
you could launch that as a digital product of
hey buy this $99 guide on how to automate your

[23:00]
business to save time and money or you could sell
it as a software zapier that's what Zapier sells
like Zapier sells automate your business to
make more money save more time right like you
could sell it as coaching like hey join this
community that will help you automate your
business so right there's all of these vehicles
that exist similarly to form factor on CPG product
right there's protein shakes there's protein bars
there's dude there's protein pop-tarts now shout
out legendary right like there's creatine gummies
creatine powders creatine drinks creat like all of
the all of the vehicles that exist and so when
I look at these and see collagen supplement I
go okay what is what is the vehicle like create
trycreate.com phenomenal like yeah amazing founder

[24:00]
amazing product like so good and all he did not
to like water down everything he's achieved he's
a great operator but he just changed the form
factor of creatine creatine historically has
always been a we need to be gummy everything like
everything it's all a gummy dude like it's all a
gummy or like it's literally whatever and so it's
like when I look at all of this I just implore
people to explore the vehicle side of the game
with different price points different requirements
of like everyone's over here saying I'm going to
launch a SAS to do AB C and D and I'm like dude
you'd probably make more money selling that as
a service a digital product a coaching program
a community whatever right fewer skills right like
you don't have to go learn just cuz lovable is an
exploding topic doesn't mean that that's the only
way for you to make money on an offer but everyone
just like wants to run a software product any
software that I've ever had success with started

[25:02]
as a service business like Creative OS was an
agency called Better Creatives three years ago
i sell the same thing that that agency sold
which is higher converting ad creatives we
were just doing it as a service then we sold
it as a digital product buy our template pack
one time then we transitioned it into
a software have sold the whole like the
same offer all the way through but the
vehicle changed and so I'm like start
with the start with the vehicle that's the
easiest software is arguably the hardest
i'm sitting here being like "Dude I might just try
to sell the book top of funnel for hummingbirds
right?" Like it proves that more people want the
thing it's not even that we're trying to do the
easier thing it's like if you choose the harder
thing then you're going to be less likely to ever
get to launch right it's just more friction right
you know like there's people that pop in saying
"Hey I want to do this as a as a software." And
it's like "Awesome have you ever sold this to

[26:01]
a human being before?" And they're like "No." I
was like "Dude I'm promise you just like go sell
it as a service first they'll tell you what to do
they'll tell you what that like what they actually
care about." And it's easier to go and update an
ebook or a service or a than it is to go and make
those product iterations on a software and guys
you'll make more money selling it as a service
like yeah at a thousand customers software makes
more sense but if you're going to go fight for 10
customers on an offer I promise you you'll make
more money doing it as a service than a software
right now so do that first and then use what
you learn and the cash flow that you got to then
invest in automation and technology that supports
that offer in the best way like what are we
doing what are we doing bro all right thanks for
joining us we'll see you next time on the Coloner
