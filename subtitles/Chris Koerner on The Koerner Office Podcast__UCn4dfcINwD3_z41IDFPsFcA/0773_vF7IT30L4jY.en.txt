[00:00]
I had seven jobs and my revenue was
46,825.
&gt;&gt; Wo. I'm showing up to these quotes in my
minivan. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; It's a beatup minivan, too.
&gt;&gt; You knew nothing about this industry
going into it. You heard my podcast. You
joined some Facebook groups. [music] And
your first two months, you've done just
under $50,000 in sales.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly. Yep.
&gt;&gt; That's incredible.
&gt;&gt; The playbook's working.
&gt;&gt; All right. Almost exactly a year ago, I
had a guy on the pod named Sinko. Sinko
started a line striping business in
Waco, Texas, and he was crushing it. It
was one of my best episodes ever. And
then just a week or two ago, I found a
guy named Hunter in Springfield,
Missouri that started a line striping
business. And what do you know? He got
inspired to start this business based on
that episode. So, this is kind of
another stump grinding situation all
over again. But Hunter leveled it up a
notch and his business is crushing it
even more. He's done $50,000
very profitably his first two months

[01:01]
very profitably his first two months
without any knowledge or experience in
the field. So, of course, I asked him,
"How are you finding customers? How do
you start this business? And how can
people copy you? Please enjoy." So, two
full months you've been active,
&gt;&gt; correct? And what is your revenue to
date? What did your monthly revenue look
like for your first two months?
&gt;&gt; I I'll go September 27th, my first job,
to October 31st. So, just over a month.
First month I had four jobs and my
revenue was 22,874.
&gt;&gt; Holy crap. From four jobs. Those are big
jobs.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And and that's something that I
liked about the industry was was it is a
little a little bit of a bigger ticket.
And then in November, I had seven jobs
and my revenue was 46,825.
So, we had a big jump. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You had almost twice as many jobs and
your average job size went up as well.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; So, Andre, I don't know if you know

[02:00]
&gt;&gt; So, Andre, I don't know if you know
this, but I'm an expert in industry cuz
I spoke to Sino a year ago about his
business. So, clearly I know everything.
I know those are good numbers. Just
kidding. I don't know anything about
this industry, which is why we're
talking.
&gt;&gt; That's what kickstarted this though was
your was your inter your podcast with
Sinko and I just thought, man, that's a
great idea. and and I'm sure we'll talk
about it, but I thought I thought I
would be 100% in striping and it's
turned out to be I like the seal coating
aspect a lot more. But
&gt;&gt; isn't that beautiful? Like the business
never ends up where it starts and it
that's how it should be and that means
you're flexible enough to go with the
energy and to go where the the product
market fit is the most.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure.
&gt;&gt; So, I'm going to get into how you
acquired those customers. That's a key
part of this. I want to talk about your
equipment, where you found the machine,
what type of machine, etc. But before we
go there, what made you flip from
primarily line striping to primarily

[03:00]
primarily line striping to primarily
seal coating? And before you even answer
that, let me interrupt myself. What is
seal coating?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so seal coating is uh you've got
some old asphalt. Think of parking lot,
but also a driveway. And over time, you
just have it it gets worn down. So it it
starts to fade. it it turns uh a lighter
shade of gray. You start to get some
cracks developing. And so seal coating
is where you are applying whether it's
uh by squeegee or by spraying just a
thin super thin layer of of asphalt to
resurface it, make it look nice and and
hopefully prevent more cracks forming.
&gt;&gt; And those videos are so satisfying.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Like watching people do that.
&gt;&gt; Yep. Yeah. very fun to watch.
&gt;&gt; So, what was it about my episode with
Cinco that got you interested in this
industry?
&gt;&gt; I was binging a lot of your content
actually and just trying to figure out,
okay, what's a good idea? I want to do
something in the service space, blue
blue collar services, home services. I

[04:03]
blue collar services, home services. I
liked that it was a lot of B2B in my
experience that that seems to be better
customers. I I don't think that always
holds true, but but in general, they're
going to pay without complaining as much
or or just they're they're used to
paying more. And then I also like that
it's uh a higher ticket item. So So
power washing, that's great, but doing
&gt;&gt; 500 bucks.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Or or less, right? A couple
hundred bucks here and there, you you
really have to get a lot of jobs.
&gt;&gt; All right, so you heard the episode.
What were your next steps? It just kind
of percolated a little in my mind. I
wasn't in a big rush. Luckily, I I
connected with with this guy who does
striping in Utah. We we were grouped to
Well, we were part of some um golf group
on X
&gt;&gt; and I I just reached out to him. We we
had a little conversation. He he's been

[05:00]
had a little conversation. He he's been
super helpful. That's what really
convinced me, okay, this is a great
industry. I've heard it from two people
now. there's a lot of potential here.
So, honestly though, after that was kind
of put on pause for a few months. And in
those few months, the biggest thing I
did was just join some of the Facebook
groups
&gt;&gt; for line striping and seal coding.
&gt;&gt; For line striping at at this point in
time, seal coding, I knew nothing, was
not on my radar. I thought 100% line
striping. Yeah. Just tried to learn a
little bit about the equipment, what
what everyone in the industry was doing.
And then in July, I ended up buying my
first my first machine, but there was a
little bit of a transition period, took
a little bit of time off, and then
really really got going in September.
&gt;&gt; What did that first job look like? Both
from a revenue perspective and a profit
perspective, and like logistically, like
how did you perform it? How did you
learn what to do? What was it like?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I I just made a Facebook post in

[06:00]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I I just made a Facebook post in
my town's Facebook page. I said, "Hey, I
want to give back. What's a good
business that I can do some lines for
free?" Completely free. No strings
attached. I just I mean, I can't put it
on my driveway, right?
&gt;&gt; Yep. Yep.
&gt;&gt; And the paint's relatively expensive. So
So I wanted to it to go to a good cause.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Please don't suggest Walmart. I
can't afford that. Uh maybe a sandwich
shop.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, well, and and my town's really
small. So, so it's a town of 30,000.
There's there's not many businesses at
all.
&gt;&gt; Sorry. What town is this?
&gt;&gt; It's called Rogers Rogersville. It's
just outside Springfield.
&gt;&gt; Okay. And then Springfield is like
170,000 people. Greater Springfield,
450,000 people, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Give or take.
&gt;&gt; Rogersville. Okay. 4,300 according to
Google.
&gt;&gt; One thing I always like to say, we don't
have a stoplight in town. But yeah,
there's not a lot of businesses. So, I I
got a lot of great comments and and

[07:01]
got a lot of great comments and and
awareness from that Facebook post and I
ended up just working with a nonprofit
in town. Uh yeah, there's a lot of green
on that map, right?
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, I I worked with this nonprofit
in town. Super small place. They do a
lot of good. And I striped five lines.
&gt;&gt; And those five lines,
&gt;&gt; that's a small job, right?
&gt;&gt; Super small. I mean, they didn't so so
they didn't have lines there to begin
with because it was too small. You know,
a lot of people it's a minimum charge of
like 500 bucks and they're not going to
pay that for five lines.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, it took me probably two hours.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; To do this,
&gt;&gt; which looking back that was way too
long.
&gt;&gt; Oh, I mean it's it's a mile from my
house. It should have taken me 10
minutes.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Max. and and yeah, so it was a struggle
and and I did it in the dark, too, which
was harder than I expected for my first

[08:02]
was harder than I expected for my first
job.
&gt;&gt; Would you be able to tell me the name of
the nonprofit?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's Safe Haven.
&gt;&gt; Safe. I want to pull it up on Google
Earth right there. Right.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; All right. So,
&gt;&gt; we'll see if the the image is updated.
&gt;&gt; It this image is from 2025. It doesn't
say the month, so it might be. Was it
this building right here? Correct. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, it's just like three parking spots
basically.
&gt;&gt; Five.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Oh, five lines.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Big difference, right?
&gt;&gt; Oh, there it is. That looks fresh. Is
that
&gt;&gt; one one to the left? So, it doesn't look
like it was it was updated.
&gt;&gt; Oh, there it is. Yep. So, they needed
it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Real quick, please subscribe to my
channel. I know it's kind of lame to
ask, but it means a lot. Thanks.
&gt;&gt; And super great people. I I wish I knew
what I knew now. I could have done
better, whatever. But but they got five
lines. I had some experience. And I
should say before I did this, I went to

[09:01]
should say before I did this, I went to
a parking lot and I just filled up my
machine with water and I just sprayed
water to at least get the feel of
pushing it and lining it all up.
&gt;&gt; That's smart. Which Facebook page was
it?
&gt;&gt; Rogersville Residents.
&gt;&gt; So it was a group,
&gt;&gt; correct? Yep. Would it be okay if I pull
up the uh the post or do you think it's
not visible to me?
&gt;&gt; I could probably pull it up. I don't
know if it would be the this the bottom.
Yeah, that one.
&gt;&gt; It's private, so I won't be able to see
it. I just wanted people to like
visualize. All right, 11,000 people in
here. It's a private Facebook group.
Every town has at least one of these. It
looks like you have at least two.
Rogersville 2, Rogersville Residents
Uncensored, etc. I just want people to
see how approachable this is. like you
you don't live in too small of a city.
You have a Facebook group, at least one,
and the fact that you did it for free,
is genius. Did did you tell people like,
"I'm an idiot. I don't know what I'm
doing. I want to practice." Or were you
just like, "I want to do some good. I
want to paint some lines." They're

[10:00]
want to paint some lines." They're
assuming that this is your business.
You've done this a hundred times.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And and in retrospect, I wish I
would have taken that approach and said,
"This is new for me. I just want some
practice. I'll even take two or three
lots." And instead I was trying to be
because I thought people voted on the
businesses and I thought, okay, I can
contact all of these who are voted on
and and try to pitch them and and
actually make some money from it, which
which I think is a good idea, a good
marketing idea, but uh I I should have
been a little bit more upfront and
straightforward and just said, "Hey,
this is new to me. I'm going to take my
time and do a good job." But it's a
there's a little bit of a learning
curve. It's not hard. It's my first time
though. So that is one thing I I wish I
would have done. And and I in fact I did
get some quotes out of it, but because I
was uh I was still holding myself out as
this is my business. This is what we do.

[11:02]
this is my business. This is what we do.
I didn't get any of the jobs.
&gt;&gt; Why do you think that is? I think it's
because I I didn't have the answers to
everything and and I should have just
and and they asked questions. They would
have been more lenient if you were like,
"Hey, full disclosure, guys. I don't
know what I'm doing." Which is why I'm
not charging, but I also want to do good
for the community. This is perfectly
free. You have nothing to lose. If it
looks ugly, I'll remove it. I'll fix it.
Right. If you go into it with that, then
people will have maybe have more grace
on these sales calls. You know what I'm
saying?
&gt;&gt; Oh, 100%. and and that's and so I did
switch my approach but uh from from this
initial initial outreach yeah it did not
did not lead to any money unfortunately
for those of the listening it's time to
give back I love Rogersville have lived
here for one year now and I want to give
back I run 417 striping and ceiling who
here has a parking lot that needs a
refresh we'll provide free striping
painting all the lines handicapped spots
etc comment with the business you think

[12:00]
etc comment with the business you think
needs it most and we'll coordinate with
the one that gets the most votes.
Community Park 69%, Taco Bell 1%, no
love for Taco Bell. Yeah,
&gt;&gt; but you know they're publicly traded.
Henderson Lodge 7%. The Library 10%
Street from Park South to Old Trailer
Parks 0% for Love of All Things 193
South Marshall 7% and Safe Haven New
Rogersville. Now Rogersville 6%.
&gt;&gt; So you can see I mean almost 200 votes.
It got some decent
&gt;&gt; Okay, I didn't see that. Holy cow.
&gt;&gt; There were seven comments.
So
&gt;&gt; So 5% of the town voted on your your
poll. That's crazy. You should run for
mayor.
&gt;&gt; So the community was I I reached out to
them. I was supposed to meet with the
town manager.
&gt;&gt; He ended up, you know, he stood me up
and and he apologized and we set up a
different time and something else
happened. So, so it just, you know, I
wasn't in a rush, but it took a couple

[13:00]
wasn't in a rush, but it took a couple
weeks. I'm like, forget it. We're just
going to go with with option number two.
&gt;&gt; You mean to say you had a hard time
coordinating with the local government?
That sounds shocking.
&gt;&gt; Exactly. Exactly.
&gt;&gt; That wanted that you were trying to
offer free services to.
&gt;&gt; I know.
&gt;&gt; We love Rogersville. We don't want to
talk trash.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we talked on the
phone. Great guy. He was really busy at
the time, but it just it it did not end
up happening. So, uh, maybe maybe next
year. Yeah, I did Safe Haven. So, that's
the story there. That was that was the
first week of September, and then I went
door todo in Springfield for some So, I
I did that. I had one job under my belt,
took some before and after pictures, and
then I went door todoor in Springfield
trying to get more business. I think I
spent two afternoons doing that, and it
was just terrible. I I've learned a lot,
but no one no one likes it. I I really
struggled to to reach the actual

[14:00]
struggled to to reach the actual
business owners.
&gt;&gt; It was usually just some $15 an hour
person managing managing the store, the
the cash register. And so it just went
nowhere.
&gt;&gt; So you're telling people to give them
hope. You don't have to go door to door
to be successful in this business.
&gt;&gt; No. And and I think I mean I think Sinko
did and and that's part of what what
inspired me to do it, but that's not who
I am. I'm not I'm not very good at that.
&gt;&gt; Well, there's more ways to win than one,
you know.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; What does the process look like for
striping versus seal coating? If if you
could get all the business in the world,
but you had to choose either striping or
seal coating, which would you choose and
why?
&gt;&gt; 100% seal coating. So, so one, seal
coating is a bigger ticket for for these
churches. When we're doing like a $1,500
or $2,000 striping job, we're we're
doing a $10 to $20,000 seal coating job.

[15:01]
doing a $10 to $20,000 seal coating job.
So, it's it's basically 10x.
&gt;&gt; Wow.
&gt;&gt; For for the most part. So, so that's
one. Number two is it's simpler. the the
material costs are higher, but the
actual equipment is is actually cheaper.
I would say it's just easier to run. I
cannot tell you how many issues I've had
with my striping equipment. And and part
of that's on me just because I bought it
used, but it's been a headache. And and
so I did I did go from one machine to
two machines recently, which I never
expected to do at this point in time,
but but I just felt like I had to
because it's been such a headache when
when some a machine goes out and it's
Saturday and I say, "Hey, pastor, your
lot's not going to be done. We'll put
down some temporary lines, but it's not
going to look great for your services
tomorrow." And I know they they've been
super nice, but I would hate to be

[16:00]
super nice, but I would hate to be
thinking, "Okay, I just spent $10,000
and you're telling me it's not even
going to look good or it's not done on
time." That's that's business 101.
&gt;&gt; I Well, I would imagine there's a lot
more moving parts. Literally, there's a
lot more precision in the striping
equipment. There's more that can go
wrong, more variables, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a ton of variables. Yep.
&gt;&gt; How does the equipment cost compare
between the two? You said it was more
expensive on the striping side.
&gt;&gt; You can deck out both of them and and
pay a lot of money. I I paid I paid
2,300 for my first striper.
&gt;&gt; It's nothing.
&gt;&gt; Nothing, right? You you did that back in
two jobs. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But if you were going to buy it new or
buy buy an upgraded version, you're
talking like 10,000 bucks. I I actually
did rent one for for a weekend and their
their setup was 25,000 for just the
striping machine for seal coating. I
know people who are doing this out of a

[17:00]
know people who are doing this out of a
big a big plastic drum.
&gt;&gt; Just freaking dumping out some tar and
spreading it around with a squeegee. Am
I oversimplifying it?
&gt;&gt; No. Exactly. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Okay. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And and if you
&gt;&gt; don't tell the EPA
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Exactly. If if you want to get a a
you know a basic setup new 3,000 4,000
put it on a trailer say 10,000 allin
max.
&gt;&gt; Oh my gosh. Okay. All right. So your
first few jobs you do four the first
month, seven the next month. What do
your profit margins look like on all
these jobs?
&gt;&gt; So on striping my first few jobs it was
just me. I actually did I don't remember
how many jobs I did out of my minivan
where I I was loading it up, seats are
down, and it it just fit with an inch to
clear, but it was just me. Paints paint
would average about like 20% of of the
of the job

[18:01]
of the job
&gt;&gt; and then um I'm pocketing the other 75
or 80%.
&gt;&gt; And you're doing everything yourself? No
employees at this point?
&gt;&gt; Uh no, just me. Yeah. And now where
we're at with seal coating, the material
costs a lot more. So the profit margins
are lower, but I would say even after
labor still 30 to 40%.
&gt;&gt; So you knew nothing about this industry
going into it. You heard my podcast. You
started doing some research. You joined
some Facebook groups. You posted in your
local Facebook group saying, "I'll do a
job for free." Um, and your first two
months, you've done just under $50,000
in sales. and about $20,000 in net
profit, which would have been about
$30,000 in net profit had you not subbed
out those first jobs. Do I have all that
right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly. Yep.
&gt;&gt; That's incredible. I mean, I interview a
lot of business owners on this podcast
and that's that's way up there when it
comes to amount of money earned in what
amount of time. That's incredible. And

[19:01]
amount of time. That's incredible. And
in a small town, nonetheless, can we
talk some more about customer
acquisition? So, what does your website
look like? What does your Google
business profile look like? Like how
much are you worried or concerned about
the little things as far as web presence
or paid ads or any of that is concerned?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, so I have not been at all. My
website I uh I paid some guy overseas
200 bucks to to build it. I've worked
with him in the past. He's a great
developer. He did a good job. I did not
give him content to work with. We spun
up some images with AI and just got
something live. It's I I don't even know
if anybody goes to it, but they at least
know that I have a domain.
&gt;&gt; You know what's even better than a
perfect website? $50,000 in sales in two
months.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly. I It's a It's a
wintertime project. We're going to We're
going to update it. We're going to make
it look good.
&gt;&gt; It's great.
&gt;&gt; There's nothing Yeah, that's not the
point.
&gt;&gt; Got me. Yeah. I launched a business this

[20:00]
&gt;&gt; Got me. Yeah. I launched a business this
year and we got to $5,000 or sorry, we
got to $500,000 in revenue and we never
had a website ever. Like it's just it
it's situational dependent, but like
&gt;&gt; well and and that was the biggest was
yeah I I didn't want to have an excuse
to say this is why I'm not I I haven't
done doortodoor or I haven't done the
emails and there were a few times in
this process where I just had to say
okay forget it. I don't know what I'm
doing. I'm not ready but just do it. I'm
never gonna be ready.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Never.
&gt;&gt; And so I don't have a Google business
profile. Google for some reason labeled
me as they they've suspended me.
&gt;&gt; Uh I'm working through that. It's a
pain. I might just rename the company. I
don't know.
&gt;&gt; But but it's not live yet.
&gt;&gt; That's frustrating.
&gt;&gt; And so the next thing I did was just an
email an email campaign. I paid someone
on Upwork five or six bucks to compile a
list of all the churches in Springfield.

[21:01]
list of all the churches in Springfield.
When we were thinking about moving here,
the the one negative thing about Spring
Well, there were a couple negative
things. One of the negative things about
Springfield was there's so many churches
and it's like a religious revival every
weekend here, which I'm like, okay,
that's great. That that sounds like a
great place to raise a family. And so
there was there was over 300 churches in
Springfield that I emailed. So 150
175,000 people in the city and uh I I've
done a little bit of cold email before.
It's hard.
&gt;&gt; No success ever before and this one just
popped off. I I think I think I was
getting like five or 7% response rate.
&gt;&gt; She and and this isn't a campaign. This
is just one email. And I would say
twothirds of the emails were to info at
the church name
&gt;&gt; catch all catch all addresses which are
&gt;&gt; going specific right

[22:01]
&gt;&gt; going specific right
&gt;&gt; like dude like three hours ago I taught
a a tutorial on cold email and I said
delete the catchalls don't even mess
with them now like it's context
dependent right and I still would have
said that based on what I was teaching
them about like the industry but if I
were doing this I would have done the
same thing because that's all I know
you're telling Keep them in there, baby.
&gt;&gt; Well, and I I know they're not as high
quality, but but where I'm I'm not
blasting it out to millions or even
thousands. It's like just hit them all.
It's worth a shot.
&gt;&gt; Did you scrub the emails first to
validate them? Make sure they're still
active.
&gt;&gt; I did not.
&gt;&gt; Okay. And no follow-ups.
&gt;&gt; Cuz all the magic's in the follow-up.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, it got busy fast.
&gt;&gt; Good.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, so I did not and and I and and
it was a little bit strategic as well
because I knew that I there was a lot to
learn. I didn't know what my pricing
should be. I didn't know I wanted to
test some different email language. I

[23:00]
test some different email language. I
wanted to hit these people up this
coming spring to say, "Okay, here's a
new offer. Here's something else." So,
so I will be emailing them again, but
yeah, not it was one and done here.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So 300 churches, let's talk like
as as exact as you can remember on these
numbers. How many did you email and then
how many responses did you get? Five to
7% of what?
&gt;&gt; I wish I had pulled these exact numbers.
I let's let's say 7% responded. So
that's, you know, and it might have even
been a little bit higher now that I'm
thinking about it because I've I've done
about 20 quotes.
&gt;&gt; Wow. And and I would say half of the
people who responded said, "Thanks for
emailing. Talk to me next year. Good
luck on your business. God bless." All
that. But but it wasn't an actual quote.
So that if we say 40, we're talking like
12% response rate.
&gt;&gt; Wow.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And and then half of those led to

[24:01]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And and then half of those led to
actual quotes.
And And I should say at this time, I'm
pretty frugal. I I don't want to put a
lot of money into something until I know
it's going to work. And so I'm showing
up to these quotes in my minivan and uh
you know
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It doesn't look Well, and it's
it's a beatup minivan, too. It's it's
it's had a better life in the past. So
So I'm showing up. It's not super
professional. I I didn't even have a
business card day one. I I just had a a
print out that I was handing out. But
yeah, the response was great and and I
realized pretty quickly that the people
who wanted a quote on just using
satellite, give them a quote fast
because part of my thesis was okay, if I
can give a quote to them fast, they're
more likely to book. But that's not the
case in this part in in this situation.
And I think it's mostly because I was
doing outbound. They weren't reaching

[25:00]
doing outbound. They weren't reaching
out to me. if they were reaching out to
me, they were probably already in the
market. But
&gt;&gt; yeah,
&gt;&gt; but uh in this case,
&gt;&gt; good framework.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I I realized I needed to be there
in person. They needed to see that I'm
not
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; some
druggy or whatever.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I'm local.
&gt;&gt; And it's a church especially like it's
like the most local type of organization
there is. Well, and I I should say too,
just show that I'm a person be because
there's a lot of scams out there. These
are older. It's an older generation for
the most part running the churches. And
so they they want to make that
face-to-face connection.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And your close rate, like all else
equal, your close rate is always going
to be higher in person, regardless of
industry.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Regardless of vehicle. Although I
I have noticed since since I upgraded to
a truck, my close rate has increased.
&gt;&gt; That makes sense cuz it's like, whoa,
dude. Like, you're laying down this
permanent paint on my parking lot that

[26:01]
permanent paint on my parking lot that
everyone in the world is going to see.
You're not signaling to me that you know
what you're doing in a van.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Exactly. Yep.
&gt;&gt; All right. So, 12% response rate, give
or take. You only emailed churches to
start.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And and I don't I don't recall
exactly where that idea came from. I
know I bought a couple other lists as
well. I bought one for uh property
managers,
for commercial real estate agents, but
yeah, I I only emailed the churches.
&gt;&gt; What What did you pay for that list?
&gt;&gt; Each one was like five or six bucks.
&gt;&gt; Each email or each list?
&gt;&gt; Each list? So So I bought I bought a
couple, but but yeah, for those 300 it
was it was literally six bucks.
&gt;&gt; So your return on ad spend it was like
a,000x. It's not even It's just stupid.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's crazy.
&gt;&gt; So, of the seven plus four of the 11
jobs you did, you did the first two
months, were they all churches?
&gt;&gt; So, I did three Taco Bells

[27:01]
&gt;&gt; So, I did three Taco Bells
and that was someone that I knew. I I
reached out to him and
&gt;&gt; franchisee.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yep. He owned all three. Yeah. So,
but but everything else was a church.
&gt;&gt; So, all of your jobs came from cold
email or a friend? Yep.
&gt;&gt; Beautiful. And you haven't even tried
cold emailing any other industry. For
all you know, transmission and muffler
shops have a 20% response rate. Like,
who knows?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I I'm sure some will be better.
Yeah,
&gt;&gt; I would think most would be worse cuz
12% is great, but it can't be the best.
Like, statistically speaking, there's
too many other industries to try. I will
say one reason I did go for churches is
because most of them have a pretty good
size lot and and I didn't want to show
up to another one like Safe Haven where
it's okay I would have to charge you 500
bucks to do those five lines. That's
just not that's not great for you. It's
not going to be great for me.
&gt;&gt; How price sensitive are churches
compared to like a Taco Bell?
&gt;&gt; Honestly, I I don't know. I would say

[28:02]
&gt;&gt; Honestly, I I don't know. I would say
from from the conversations I've had,
most churches ha want to be wise with
their money, but they also have funds
set aside because this is something that
they have to do every 3, four, 5 years,
so they're ready to spend it.
&gt;&gt; So, how big is an average church parking
lot? How do you price stuff out?
&gt;&gt; So, most of the church parking lots that
I've done have been around 200 parking
stalls. So, my first actual job that I
did, I think I charged $450 per line and
then uh 10 $10 to $20 per stencil. So, I
would do $20 for a blue and white
handicap and then $10 for a parking or a
directional arrow.
&gt;&gt; How'd you land on that price?
&gt;&gt; It's these Facebook groups have been
super helpful to me. So, I saw some info
there. I think Sino shared some pricing
info as well and and honestly a huge

[29:00]
info as well and and honestly a huge
resource has just been AI just asking
whether it's Grock or chat GPT what what
I should be at.
&gt;&gt; I have to think that most business
owners or pastors in this case don't
really know what a fair price is for
this cuz it's such an infrequent
service. Is that the case or or do they
kind of have a ballpark in mind? I think
a lot of them ended up getting
additional quotes. This is why October
revenue was so low, but November was
fantastic is because it they have to
present it to their board. They have
they have pretty they they have a
process to go through to go through
before anything gets approved.
[clears throat]
&gt;&gt; Longer sales cycle.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. And and that's something I
wish I had realized before I contacted
them first because it was a slow few
weeks getting getting started.
&gt;&gt; Those 11 jobs, you're not counting the
first free one, right? Or you are.
&gt;&gt; No, I'm not.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, those 11 jobs, you basically
closed eight cuz the Taco Bells were

[30:01]
closed eight cuz the Taco Bells were
three locations, right? Seven churches
and four Taco Bells or what was it?
&gt;&gt; Eight churches and three Taco Bells.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, you've closed nine jobs
basically. One was your friend, eight
were strangers. You've quoted 20, right?
I'm trying to get to what your close
rate is. We're talking like 40 50%.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yep.
&gt;&gt; That's pretty good, especially for such
a a high ticket item.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I I've been really happy. And And
again, it's just it's just a longer
sales cycle. I'm really excited for the
spring though because So, I'm I'm done
here for the winter right now. We are we
are shut down as of a week ago, but I'm
going to hit it hard. I've got I've got
around 200,000 in quotes that uh I've
already given out that I'm going to be
following up on and I think I'll get a
lot of them for the spring.
&gt;&gt; So, your average job size is like we're
talking like seven grand somewhere like
that. Yeah, it's it's a a little
misleading just because uh we've had I I

[31:00]
misleading just because uh we've had I I
would say my average striping only job
is between$1 and $2,000 and then
sealing.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, seal coating is a a big ticket.
[snorts]
&gt;&gt; All right. Tell me what happened during
that first job that turned you on to
seal coating.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And and so let me backtrack just a
second and say when we're talking about
my close rate, my close rate could have
been higher, but I show up to these jobs
and and I think my email was pretty
straightforward. I said, "We do
striping. I'm going to give you a
discount for striping services." And I
got, you know, all these people saying,
"Hey, give me a quote." Well, I go to
meet them in person and they say, "Oh, I
wanted a quote for striping and
ceiling."
&gt;&gt; No one wanted.
&gt;&gt; You're like, "What's ceiling?"
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. And so, I know
some of those jobs, those early quotes,
I I lost out on because I was like,
"Yeah, I don't do that." You know, I can
get you a quote, but honestly, it's I
just do the striping. And in my mind,

[32:01]
just do the striping. And in my mind,
it's like, "Okay, that's great." And in
their mind, they're thinking X, let's
get the next guy because I need both. I
don't need this one.
&gt;&gt; Which what a great lesson in being
willing to be flexible because it's like
focus, focus, focus, focus on one thing.
What if you don't? Like where would you
be today if you're like no, I only do
striping because that's what I'm
focusing on. I want to be the best in
the world at striping. And that is
there. There's many ways to win. I'll go
to my grave saying that. Right. But like
you were like, let's try seal coating.
And then it's like, holy crap, this is
the whole business.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. there there's a market for just
striping and and I think now that I'm a
few months in I I I would say that if
you if you just want to do striping
forget outreach to church forget well
and I'll add one more caveat here but
forget outreach to church forget
outreach to to property managers
talk to construction companies because
you're going to be striping the new lots
and that's about it at least in this

[33:00]
and that's about it at least in this
area and so the caveat is as Sinko.
Sinko's in Texas.
&gt;&gt; He's in Waco. Yeah. Central Texas.
&gt;&gt; Completely different. And so I'm I'm
actually going to be doing some jobs in
Texas over the winter. They don't need
seal coating for the most part. It's
it's a way smaller industry. Their their
parking lot lines fade though with with
the sun and so they just have to be
redone. It's it's a standalone service.
Guys, I hate to break it to you, but
you're not very likely to actually start
a business based on something you see or
hear on this podcast, unless you spend a
little more time with me and with other
people that are doing just that. So,
come check out TK Owners. That's
tkowners.com where hundreds of people
are launching, starting, testing,
experimenting with business ideas that
they heard from this podcast. If you
want to go fast, go alone. If you want
to go far, go together. Check out
tkowners.com. We'd love to have you. All
right. So, have you tried anything else?
texting, calling, you've done
doortodoor, you've done email, you
talked to your friend with the Taco

[34:00]
talked to your friend with the Taco
Bells. Have you done or tried anything
else to acquire customers?
&gt;&gt; Nothing as of now. So, I I mentioned
doing some jobs in Texas in winter. The
playbook's working. I got another list
of of churches in Texas where my parents
live and I emailed I think I've emailed
the first half of the list and uh we're
going to get some work from it. We've
already gotten some quotes and some of
them are going to close.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, you've done the same outreach
to two different markets entirely and
were the the metrics from the second
from the Texas campaign. Was it better
or worse than Springfield?
&gt;&gt; It was it was a little bit worse. So, I
think I sent about a 100 emails right
around 100 and uh I've done four or five
quotes. So, I think it's a little bit
lower but still like
&gt;&gt; so good. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I mean, Hunter, just promise me you'll
start following up with these.
&gt;&gt; I know. I know.
&gt;&gt; Please. You're going to triple those
numbers.

[35:00]
numbers.
&gt;&gt; This was in a small town. This was You
You've talked about Pan Plantation.
That's my My parents live 10 minutes
from there.
&gt;&gt; So, you're you're an hour out of DFW.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And uh
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I I
&gt;&gt; Yep. Exactly. I need to move closer to
DFW and and things will really blow up,
&gt;&gt; dude. Okay. All right. What about
equipment? What did you spend on the
equipment? Where did you buy it from?
How did you choose what brand or make
model you use?
&gt;&gt; So, so startup costs, I I I paid uh $800
for my stencils. So, all the arrows, the
letters, the no parking.
&gt;&gt; Where do you buy those from?
&gt;&gt; I bought them from 1800 stencil. It they
just had the best price online. I I went
solely based off price. I mean, they've
Yeah, they're a reputable company, but
it worked for me. They I I've continued
to buy from them. I spent about Oh, and
then I spent $2,300 on my machine, and

[36:00]
then I spent $2,300 on my machine, and
that was that was the extent of my
startup costs. In my email, I I would
say, "Hey, I'm licensed and insured."
And then before I did my first job, I
did buy insurance, but but I did not
have it when I sent the emails. And that
was like 230 bucks.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, all in startup costs were
&gt;&gt; 3,000. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; What is your ongoing overhead?
&gt;&gt; I pay $29 a month for uh for quote IQ
just to send out quotes.
&gt;&gt; And then insurance,
&gt;&gt; it's $9250 a month.
&gt;&gt; $93.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. [sighs and gasps]
Uh what about like uh gas like truck
insurance, stuff like that? So truck the
the advice I got was keep I I actually
do want to move it over to to be a
business truck fully, but at this point
in time I still drive more for for just
personal activities. So it's it's uh
it's not a commercial policy yet. I

[37:00]
it's not a commercial policy yet. I
think it added 30 bucks to my insurance.
&gt;&gt; Any like crazy stories or headaches from
this business yet? Something that people
can watch out for.
&gt;&gt; So So one would be just man Yeah. when
when the machine breaks down and you're
on a time crunch, it is it is tough. You
know, this this has not been just a walk
in the park. There there have been some
stressful moments. The the most
stressful part, we haven't even talked
about crack filling, which has been a
really good a really good addition as
well in tandem with seal coating. And so
with that, you're you're just putting
some rubberized tar in the cracks to to
seal them up. And uh before you do that,
you have to clean clean out the weeds
from the cracks and then also run over
it with a weed torch just to heat it up
and and help it seal better, right? I
started a fire.
[laughter]
I mean, just thinking about it, there's
a little bit of PTSD there. That was
scary. You know, in in the minute or
two, I just thought, man, I just ruined

[38:02]
two, I just thought, man, I just ruined
my family's life cuz the wind was
whipping and it started spreading fast.
&gt;&gt; I was I was 20 feet from 20 feet from a
house, 20 feet from a church.
&gt;&gt; I don't know how it started. I was being
really cautious, but uh some something
that I some some piece of grass caught
on fire blew over into a pile of leaves
and yeah, it it got up fast. So,
&gt;&gt; what did you do? How'd you get it out?
&gt;&gt; I threw I had a couple bags of sand for
the project I was using. I threw that on
and then thankfully, and we might not be
talking. I you know, I don't know how
this would have ended, but thankfully I
had a fire extinguisher that I carried
with me. Thank you, OSHA. Right. So, I I
was trying to
&gt;&gt; be compliant and uh that that put it
out, but it spread fast.
&gt;&gt; Oh my gosh.
&gt;&gt; Just just from the time it took to run
from like I notice it, I run to the
truck, I run back and it's big. Yeah,

[39:02]
truck, I run back and it's big. Yeah,
&gt;&gt; that's incredible. What would you have
done differently had you if you were to
start this over from scratch today?
&gt;&gt; I would have bought new equipment. I
didn't want to do that. I wanted to
prove the model, but but knowing that
it's proved, I would have bought new
equipment. So that yeah, just the
downtime and the headaches that would
have helped alleviate those. And then I
would have hired sooner, faster. I still
probably need to be more proactive on
this just because my value my honestly
the people I have hired, they do it
better than I do. I I am not an OCD
detailsoriented guy. And and the people
I've hired, they're amazing. They're
snapping the chalk lines. They're
measuring everything.
&gt;&gt; They're getting the angles exactly
right.
&gt;&gt; And and I'm like, let's just do it. But
but we want it to be perfect.
&gt;&gt; And so I I should have hired them day
one. I can provide way more value
getting the jobs and and overseeing the

[40:03]
getting the jobs and and overseeing the
work than than actually doing a lot of
it. But I like it. How many employees do
you have and how do you pay them? Do you
pay them like hourly or on a per job
basis?
&gt;&gt; All of them are hourly. I will hire a
couple full-time guys starting in the
spring. And that was part of my delay in
hiring too was it's like, okay, you only
have a few weeks before the season ends.
Just find some part-time guys, pay them
hourly, whatever. Yeah. So, so they were
just all guys looking to make some extra
money on the weekends or or in the
afternoons. how much per hour and where
did you find them?
&gt;&gt; So, everyone I've hired uh has been from
just from my church congregation. They
were just guys I knew who could work
hard. Uh even a couple teenagers, too,
who could work hard. And yeah, I've I've
paid the teenagers 15 bucks an hour and
my standard is 25 an hour for the guys.

[41:02]
my standard is 25 an hour for the guys.
But there have been there have been a
couple times where we've had to work at
midnight or later working till 1 or 2 am
and I'll bump it up to 30 or 35 an hour
for that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So your margins are still killer
even when you pay someone to do it for
you.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; What could I have asked you or should I
have asked you that I neglected to?
&gt;&gt; I would say like why why did you choose
it?
&gt;&gt; Why did you choose this business?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So like I said, I binged your
content. I was looking at some other
options. I thought uh doing windows in
in residential homes could be really
nice and and paid ads would crush on
that. I was also interested in in doing
well drilling, so for new homes
&gt;&gt; or or existing.
&gt;&gt; That's high ticket.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, high ticket. Super cool. Like
that. That's one that that's really
interesting to me. But the equipment
cost is just insane. I mean, it's like a
couple hundred thousand to to really get

[42:00]
couple hundred thousand to to really get
going. And so I I like this because it's
it's B2B, it's construction adjacent,
and then it's really easy to rank on on
Google.
&gt;&gt; No one no one is really focused on this
market. And so I I just thought it would
be really easy to get work uh on an
ongoing basis just from Google without
having to do any marketing. And that was
attractive. Do you compete much with
others? Like because there's a few
franchiseors that offer this, right?
Like one is famously called We Do Lines,
which is a great name. Do you find
yourself competing for jobs?
&gt;&gt; No, not not yet. And I know I know
another one's like 1800 Striping and
I've talked to some guys there and and
they do really well. But uh no, I I
think it's it's a little bit different
because most most mom and pop stores or
churches, they want you to do all of the
services, not just striping.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, what's next? How do you plan

[43:01]
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, what's next? How do you plan
to scale this business? Just more of the
same. Cold emailing, other markets, um
wait for the warmer weather.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, Google. Google's going to be huge.
Uh, so, so my online presence is a big a
big focus for me this winter, just
getting that ready to rock and roll for
the spring. And then, um, there's
there's a lot of room here. I I would
love to have two crews going in the
springtime full-time. I think we'll get
plenty of jobs. And then, yeah, with
with my parents in Texas, I I'd love to
have some sort of permanent presence
there, but uh, that's that's still in
the works.
Yeah, beautiful. Um, Hunter, where can
people find you if they want to learn
more or just reach out?
&gt;&gt; X is the best best place. Just just look
up my name, Hunter Shenwork. Happy to
give back in any way. I can help people
out and uh yeah, reach out if you have
questions.
&gt;&gt; And if you're in uh North Texas or

[44:00]
&gt;&gt; And if you're in uh North Texas or
Missouri and you need some striping or
seal coating, 417striping.com.
Are you ever going to do any residential
stuff for seal coating? possibly. It's a
big driveway, maybe a couple thousand
bucks for seal coating. So, it's it's
not
&gt;&gt; there's a lot of driveways out there at
least.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. And and so if
you have down days or whatever.
Absolutely. And that's where I think ads
could come in where it's, hey,
&gt;&gt; book on these days, we'll give you a
good deal. Like, let's just even if we
don't make money, let's just pay the
crew and and stay busy. So yeah, I I'm
sure we will do some, but haven't done
any currently. Not planning to make it a
main focus.
&gt;&gt; Love it,
&gt;&gt; Hunter. Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Thanks, Chris.
&gt;&gt; All right, what' you think? Please share
it with a friend and we'll see you next
time on the Kerner
