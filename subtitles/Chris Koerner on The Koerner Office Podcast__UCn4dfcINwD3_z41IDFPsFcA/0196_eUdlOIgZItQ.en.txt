all right I got a business idea for you
that you're going to love what do you
know about the newsletter business and
how much can you make per subscriber per
month in the newsletter business I'll
tell you at the end but first I'm going
to tell you how to get there so it is
illegal to scrape a bunch of email
addresses and add them to a newsletter
that's a no Noe that's literally illegal
but what you can do is scrape a bunch of
emails and cold email them individually
with tools like LM list mixmax or gmass
and say hey I have a newsletter for real
estate agents you're a real estate agent
what I would you mind if I added you to
it you can ask them to be opted into it
that is not illegal you there are 2
million realtors in the United States do
that to all of them now you have a
newsletter and you can charge
advertisers 50 cents per subscriber per
month so if you get 100,000 people on
your newsletter you can make $50,000 per
month with that newsletter watch the
latest episode of the ker office on my
YouTube channel link and bio for a full
description of exactly how to do this
