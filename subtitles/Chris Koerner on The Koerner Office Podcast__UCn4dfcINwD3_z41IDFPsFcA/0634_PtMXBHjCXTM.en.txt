look at this freaking thing right here I
call it the dollar hauler you got three
dollar stores right next to each other
in Alabama now anything can teach a good
business lesson and here's why this

that their target market their perfect
demographic is all right there and they
all realize that there's demand for all

Lululemon store is by the pelaton store
is by the Tesla store whether you're
selling the same product or not if the
demographics match you don't reinvent
the wheel you build right there get all
my business ideas right here
