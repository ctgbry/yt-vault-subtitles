I'm in sanini Greece right now home of
the gelato shop there is a gelato shop
basically on every corner here so let's
say you're a gelato owner and you're
like where am I going to open not in
sanini CU it's too saturated here wrong
because what matters the most in
business the market and where is a
harder market for gelato Toops there is
none it's here in Santorini so you want
to open where all the competitors are
why because people come to sanini to buy
Gelato you want to where the people are
just like Ariel okay that's your
business one-onone lesson for today
