look at this freaking thing right here
you know I love a good vending machine
concept this metal and glass box right
here can't cost more than 10 grand and
they charge you 50 cents a minute just
to go in there and have some quiet time
now as a dad of four kids I would pay 50
cents a minute for this $30 for an
hour's worth of time let's crunch the
numbers on that real quick this is day
10 of showing you my favorite business
ideas of 2025 so follow for more so
let's say this thing costs $10,000 that
means to break even on this thing you
got to rent it out for 20,000 minutes
which is 333 hours let's say
conservatively that this thing is booked
for 3 hours a day that means it'll take
a 100 days to break even on this thing
and after that it's pure profit now sure
they're probably doing a REV share with
the Seattle Airport here that's not bad
3-month payoff period for something like
this when it's only booked for 3 hours a
day I don't hate it get all my vending
ideas right here
