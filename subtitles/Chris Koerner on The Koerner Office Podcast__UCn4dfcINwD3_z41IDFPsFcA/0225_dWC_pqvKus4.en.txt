my companies send about 400,000 cold
emails every month and I've received
responses from people like John McAfee
and mark cubin from these cold emails so
here are the five best things that I've
learned in sending cold emails for the
last 16 years number one use something
like bulk email Checker to validate
these emails before sending because 5%
of cold emails go bad every year and if
you don't validate them before sending
you will get blacklisted number two use
something like instantly or mail scale
to create to use AI to create hundreds
of inboxes today so you can warm them up
over the next 21 days so you won't get
blacklisted number three use something
like upwork to buy existing email list
for like $20 instead of paying $2 per
lead much cheaper number four use as
much personalization in these emails as
possible first name and city name
preferably number five use subject line
question because it performs the best if
you want a full list of all the tools I
use for cold email just comment the word
guide and I'll send it for free I'm not
selling you anything also go watch my
latest YouTube video on the ker office I
interviewed a guy that makes 90,000 a
month with cold email
