this 30 seconds could change your life
this guy right behind me created a $30
million apparel brand by doing something
genius he thought up an amazing design
right here he knew it was good then he
went to a university Georgia State in
this case walked around with these
shirts and sold them for $5 that was his
cost he made no money why did he do this
because he wanted data he wanted walking
Billboards and he knew he'd make money
later so he sold thousands of these for
$5 each and the other brilliant thing he
did was selling on a college campus
Because that's the prime age for
influencing your peers so pretty soon
everyone on campus was wearing these $5
shirts going to his website and buying
$25 shirts which he had an 80% gross
margin on you can use this exact same
strategy to launch any t-shirt or
apparel brand you've got to start with
an amazing design that is a
non-negotiable he did that you should
also have a polarizing message or a
David verse Goliath message us vers them
that's what this shirt does and then go
spread it in an area where the people
wearing it are more likely to influence
those around them high schools colleges
workplaces Etc I made the full business
plan right here
