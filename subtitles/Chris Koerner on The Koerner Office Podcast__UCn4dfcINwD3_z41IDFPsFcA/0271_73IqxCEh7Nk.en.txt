I turned this viral video into a
business that's made 100 Grand over the
last 60 days here's how you can take
this viral video or others like it and
turn into a thriving business that'll
make you 100 Grand over the next 60 days
find a video like this know that it's
going viral because of retention AKA
people have to watch to the end aka the
platforms want to push it to more people
then find a product that solves the
problem going on in this video such as a
wheel stopper go to Alibaba find a
unique wheel stopper that has a unique
function maybe it's only for trailers
maybe you only need two instead of four
then go to card throw up a landing page
real fast to sell this product then make
a video with this same thing going on in
the background with your domain name
right there above your head if it
doesn't go viral bummer you at least
learn some skills if it does you have a
thriving business now you can go to
Shopify and make a one product template
website and actually start selling this
product rinse and repeat over and
