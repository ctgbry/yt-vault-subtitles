[00:00]
if you could take like all of your
knowledge today you're 21 years old
you've got ,000 doll to your name but
you know everything that you know right
now and you wanted to just flip stuff or
just make deals but you only have a
thousand bucks what do you think is the
biggest like most asymmetric opportunity
today to do stuff like
[Music]
that I created these two podcast
episodes was just me talking about every
business I've ever started and there's
going to be like four I've already done
two there were 35 minutes each and it
was kind of interesting because I just
have a spreadsheet but I've never really
reflected on him until I started talking
about him on the podcast and I always
like to do like an end result and so
many of them it's just like yeah and
this one it was good I just got bored
and moved on to something else and I say
that 20 times and I'm sure people are
like what are you doing yeah why
couldn't you sell it why could you
you're like well it's kind of
complicated and it's not like it would
have taken me a lot of time for some of
these companies to get them to the point
where I could sell them and yeah i'

[01:00]
where I could sell them and yeah i'
already generated a bunch of wealth with
them it was great I'm driven by energy
and those in the beginning like right
now I get a ton of energy on X and
meeting people like you so it's giving
back a lot of energy I put a lot of
energy before I've been grinding since
January to really build my account and
I'm close to 10,000 followers but it's
giving me back a lot now so that becomes
the flywheel and so those businesses
that you start and get them going like
this is totally cool and I'm figuring
this new thing out but after a while it
becomes maintenance and I don't want to
be in the maintenance business you know
and it's opportunity cost too because we
always have a zillion ideas on Deck it's
like I just I might be wrong about this
next one but I think that this next one
like it's more expensive for me to not
start this next one than to start it yes
and your business like bringing in
investors and everything like that's
very foreign to me and scares me like
I'm Fierce I know you're very

[02:00]
I'm Fierce I know you're very
independent I'm fiercely independent and
that's a different concept like I would
have questions for you about how do you
keep it how to where yeah you're just
not their horse yeah and separate
yourself to where I'm sure you're very
your whole personal being is involved
with these businesses I don't know how
to separate it I'm emotionally
connected when I fail I feel shame you
know what I mean I I don't know how to
separate it out I bet you're the same so
I would really have that it's just an
interesting concept that how do you
separate yourself out to where you don't
feel so you you already feel beholden
but anyway it's an interesting not just
that but like I'm publicly talking about
all these random things I'm doing so
aren't my investors like dude what do
you can can you focus on that Park so
I'm I I tried to get ahead of that when
I first talked to them and like I have
no operational role as a cgp like I I

[03:00]
no operational role as a cgp like I I
help Source deals through my audience
and I help raise money but like that's
it and I'm very upfront about that and
I'm sure I could raise a lot more if I
were only tweeting about RV parks that's
not fun and so that's okay F why don't
you just tell us all quickly who you are
you know I'm shann and Jean I've been
patently unemployable pretty much since
College in the sense that I always had
this idea of right or wrong that I could
do it better than maybe somebody else
not better but just I could just do it
like I could figure this out and when I
was in college my first business I had a
a landscape construction business that I
was doing great and I was shocked at how
much money I could make when it was
flowing to me directly and it wasn't
that difficult and I had a great time
working with all my friends we used to
work in the summer everything but my
first company that I really built was
called Mac rescue I fell in love with
the Mac it was life-changing for me
while I was running this landscape

[04:01]
while I was running this landscape
construction business had made me look
so much better so I could charge 20 30
40% more and I felt more confident is
confidence is just crucial in how you
present yourself and so we started that
business with a A buddy of mine and grew
it we eventually merged with the company
in the midwest business became rescue
systems and it was great you know did
really well had a huge facility did
massive deals we rode the Apple wave up
and down and you know sometimes part
when Apple had their worst years we had
our best years because we were taking
advantage of all the inefficiencies but
it was great until it wasn't and then I
got some partners that I didn't really
enjoy doing business with and so I left
and started a new company and along the
way I kept building smaller things small
side hustles meeting new people because
the great thing about being an
entrepreneurs I feel like now that I've
got more gray hair you're constantly
building this big net of overtime and

[05:03]
building this big net of overtime and
all this stuff just gets caught in it
and you get these phone calls about hey
I talked to a guy and they had this or
they want to do this deal and so one of
the things I along the way of all my
companies is I'm a product guy I'm
always looking for deals and I met tons
of people selling stuff and auctioneers
before the internet was really it got
this Au online auction stuff figured out
other than eBay
I was chasing auction auctions all over
the country flying around everywhere
buying stuff walking into companies that
the people were still using their
computers and we were bidding on them
the chair I'm sitting in right now is I
bought at an auction like 20 some OD
years ago you know what's the best like
auction flip you ever did so I went to
an auction one time in out in Kansas
when Sprint was having I don't know
people remember what Sprint was a sailor
or phone carrier they got they've been
gobbled up by some other giant

[06:00]
gobbled up by some other giant
conglomerate and I got a short notice
about hey we're having this auction
Friday I think it was Wednesday I flew
out and there was only six other B guys
that showed up so we basically walked
and bought five six I don't know 6
700,000 worth of equipment for just we
bought the whole facility it was like a
I don't know how many hundreds of
thousands of square feet but we just
walked cubicle to cubicle and they say
okay this room has 200 of these X things
X that who wants that and it just
became they weren't given the stuff away
because you only need one person to to
make an auction work or two one other
person besides yourself but yeah I think
we spent three $400,000 probably flipped
it for four or five million was amazing
wow wow how did and how did you sell
it all kinds of ways you know I sold it
to other dealers that was always we
always had a wholesale division because
a lot of times these auctions it's like
a drink of water from the fire hose and

[07:02]
a drink of water from the fire hose and
so you're just like yeah my one of my
phrases is oh yeah we'll take it all
we'll we'll take everything so I'm
immediately I say that and I'm like I
don't have the money to buy this all I I
firmly believe that you have to buy find
the deal if if the deal is good enough
you'll find the money so I would start
wholesaling it out I had a a guy or a
group of employees that were managing
eBay they pushed eBay we had a part
division they would bring stuff in and
strip it down and start selling just the
components because often times the
components were worth more than the hole
but it just took longer to sell and then
we had a repair Division and they needed
the parts for stuff and so they would be
like hey we want those power supplies or
this or we want these Laser Printers and
as you get out there you start to get a
reputation you get some credibility and
then I'd get a call from somebody that
said hey we saw or so and so at auction
house they said you bought all this

[08:00]
house they said you bought all this
stuff and for a while we you know again
dating myself a bit but Apple they built
a color laser printer and it was amazing
it was like the technology was
incredible but the problem was it had a
tray of oil inside that helped adhere
the color to the or something to the
page so if you moved it without taking
that tray out you contaminated the whole
thing so I got a call from somebody one
day that says look we've got hundreds of
these Laser Printers that have come back
in an insurance company and we need they
were replacing them for people at can
you help us out so we were buying these
Laser Printers for like 500 bucks a pop
we had an internship program they would
tear them all down clean everything out
put them all back together and we were
selling them for $5,000 and they were 10
grand brand new you know so I guess the
key is the flexibility looking at
opportunities like okay I could tear
this apart sell the components I can
wholesale some I'm not going to make as

[09:00]
wholesale some I'm not going to make as
much money but I'll let other people
make money on me I need you know I'm
going to sell we had a consumer division
that we sold to so whatever it it take
man I'm I'm just a hustler yeah yeah
what I love about you is I feel like I'm
looking at myself 10 years in the future
and you have like a house in Tahoe right
huh yeah which I'm very jealous of it's
my favorite place on Earth you're
envious jealousy is when you don't want
other people to have it you just want to
have it too yeah
I want it yes and so what I love about
you and what what I see in myself in you
is the fact that like no matter how much
quote money you've had or how much
you've made it like you're hungry for
deals in entrepreneurship and you're not
too proud to to flip something or chase
something and yeah that's exactly how I
am like I I live in this area and I'm
young for the area it's an affluent area
and when I was younger like I didn't
like I was self-conscious about these
little side hustles I was doing and I

[10:00]
little side hustles I was doing and I
think it's I think the older anyone gets
like the less they care about what
people think yeah right and I go to
church be like oh what's that thing
you're doing oh that's cute and now it's
just like I don't care like I don't care
I love what I'm doing like I'll sell
porta potties door to door if it's a
good opportunity that's right it's an
interesting deal and as you're right
getting comfortable with it where you're
like well that's kind of weird and but
like I call you know civilians regular
folks that have jobs and or employees
and they're that's awesome we need
people to to work for us and people need
to do stuff that not everybody's thinks
in their crazy brain like we do but I
don't know when it was but I would
describe people say what are you working
on I just say well I own small
businesses and I own some real estate
yeah that it's just an easy way but if
I'm talking to a person like you like an
entrepreneur I'm just like well how deep
do you want to go do you w to hear about
my 8 million side hustle selling
high-end watches do you want to talk
about $4 million business I started on

[11:01]
about $4 million business I started on
my phone and you're right it's not the
money's obviously I call it LMA money
you want to have leave me alone money
and that buys you the freedom to
experiment with other businesses and
other stuff and it also buys you the
freedom to spend more time with your
family and it's a great rubric but I'm
searching for energy I love the zero to
one part of the business it's like a
romance you know you're just oh this is
an interesting idea will it go anywhere
how much energy do I have to put in
before it starts giving me energy back
you know I love it it's a great system
if you could take like all of your
knowledge today you're 21 years old
you've got $1,000 doll to your name but
you know everything that you know right
now and you wanted to just flip stuff or
just make deals but you only have a
thousand bucks what do you think is the
biggest like most asymmetric opportunity
today to do stuff like that location is
important what what like I've had a a

[12:01]
important what what like I've had a a
lot of opportunity because I'm in the
Bay Area and I knew people that worked
at Apple I know Silicon Valley I was
close to where I was driving to these
warehouses to buy Cisco stuff or
whatever you know those kinds of things
so that I would think about what do I
have close to me am I in Nevada or is
there a Tesla plant near me that what
happens with their stuff I my
introduction to people that I don't know
is hey sell me your junk because that
gets her attention you're like what
problem product do you have that you
can't sell everybody wants the iPhone
the perfect product everybody wants the
Cherry but the way you get there is you
have to swim up streams if I only had a
thousand bucks I would look around if I
didn't have anything near me I'd go
online and I'd buy store returns from
places like Costco and maybe H Best Buy
if you if I don't recommend consumer
electronics or technology because the
margins are so thin and there's a
there's a lot of players yeah a lot of
players it's sexy so it attracts so many

[13:01]
players it's sexy so it attracts so many
people so you're better off selling
shampoo because it's so boring but
there's money there's more money so what
product Niche could you buy and if I
only had $1,000 do I would be looking
at what do people around me want to buy
what can I sell on Facebook Marketplace
what's out there and what's exciting and
even the regular Costco I can remember
going when they had they were selling
those Pez dispensers that were Star Wars
and my wife was in she's like we should
buy a few of those and sell on eBay and
I was like well let's buy the whole
pallet you know if it's a good deal for
two or three boxes let's buy 400 you
know my first line of credit was a stack
of credit cards you know I didn't have
no bank would give me any money you
think people think you're flaky banks
are even worse um so I learned to play
that game and yeah I'm a product guy now
on X you hear these guy oh I start a
digital agency or I do this and I help
people that's awesome but that's so out
of my wheelhouse yeah that I would find

[14:03]
of my wheelhouse yeah that I would find
something I could move quickly and to
make take that, make 1500 then go take
1500 and make three grand and then go
make six grand and just keep going up I
like that you bring up location like I
think that was the first word you said
because most people don't realize that
there's there are these asymmetric
supply and demand inefficiencies at play
in every little city in America Y and I
tweeted about this a while ago this do
you ever go to govdeals.com oh yeah of
course I love those yeah so you go to
gov deals and you can buy stuff to have
it Shi but in my opinion this is the
perfect example of why location is
important because if you go to gov deals
and you find cell phones and the buyer
is like I will ship these you're not
going to make any money no right because
you have everyone in the world or the
country competing for something that's
very very sexy now I'm going to take
your logic here and take something
unsexy like let's say
I'll give you a great yeah Furniture

[15:01]
I'll give you a great yeah Furniture
yeah well I'll give you a great example
if you go to the GSA general service
Administration is a government agency
that spends gazillions of our dollars
and they run an auction site GSA
Auctions and you can buy like right now
there's incredible deals on FEMA
trailers RV trailers like late model
20121 that sell I I watch these auctions
all the time I've posted about on X they
sell for five or $6,000 and these are
holy cow I might need to buy these for
RV parks yeah I mean they're all over
and modular housing that you can buy
they're all a lot of them are in
Louisiana New Orleans lot of in Florida
went to use them and I look at them just
like I'm not there so buying it to ship
to California doesn't work yeah but if I
was down there yeah I'd just be like
okay what can I buy for five or six
grand of 2020 or 2021 30 foot trailer go
to RV well you know the rvshare.com
I rent these out for or what could I

[16:00]
I rent these out for or what could I
flip them for on RV Trader you just work
the deal backwards if I can go look up
that trailer and see that it's that
people are selling it for
$122,000 and I'm local and I could buy
it for $5,000 and yeah maybe you can
have to fix a few things if you don't
like to get your hands dirty buying this
kind of inventory is probably not for
you but you could get people to go in
clean them up do excuse me do some minor
repairs and turn around and make four5
thousand a trailer and there's we're
talking hundreds of these hundreds of
these so those that's what location very
important very important so yeah forget
Furniture let's say you find these FEMA
trailers and you got two different
aspects at play one they're huge right
so they're not going to be shipped two
they're unsexy so you have two things to
your advantage so if you can get from
the Bay Area to Louisiana where these
are if you're willing to spend $400 for
a plane ticket and then as you said if

[17:01]
a plane ticket and then as you said if
you get a good enough deal the money is
there you could raise the money friends
and family like here Uncle Mike you're a
physician I assume you have money here's
a $5,000 trailer I can buy it today I
could buy 10 of them or one of them or a
hundred of them and here's the exact
same model being rented out for 250 a
night or being sold for $113,000 now I
know this trailer needs a new axle I've
already priced it out here's my research
here's three different exactly right
like you think Uncle Mike's not going to
give five grand you know right when I
was younger I was taking a cash advance
on my credit card to go buy deals like
that and that was just another column in
my or another cell in the spreadsheet
what's it going to cost me to borrow
this money some crazy amount right 28%
you're like well I'm only going to
borrow it for 30 div by 12 exactly
exactly and so you just build the model
out and see what the profit is at the
end and it's like I post deals all the
time on X I I posted this week right
like right now you can buy buy exercise

[18:00]
like right now you can buy buy exercise
equipment for next to nothing because
they were oversold during Co nobody
wants to buy them now well then I
noticed like this leag you you mentioned
furniture down in Florida truckload of
furniture store returns from Costco AB
grade so it's yeah you know decent shape
not and I feel like they're usually very
conservative on the grades because they
don't want returns so if it's a b grade
it's probably an a grade yeah and and if
there's a problem the reason I love
Costco is because they stand behind
everything they sell so if they ship you
something that doesn't match they're
very easy to work with so what I've
noticed in the last month or so is
Furniture has started to drop to next to
nothing too same with Co right like
everyone was in their house they bought
all this crap maybe yeah yeah maybe and
so there was a whole truckload of dining
room furniture and I posted when I
posted it had only four hours left in
the auction it would the highest bid was
$250 for this truckload
okay so I my post was if I was a real

[19:02]
okay so I my post was if I was a real
estate
Stager in near Okala Florida MH I I
would buy this and just put it in my
warehouse so I could use it yeah and I
got a lot of push back you can't ever
sell it don't sell it buy it use it for
something else and I I went back a few
hours later and I went and posted I said
this deal sold for 250 bucks a truckload
of this furniture and the Costco value
which is lower than everybody else's was
like
$42,000 oh my gosh yeah it's insane
imagine if you're that guy with a
thousand bucks in Okala Florida you got
right like you would have to be in Okala
looking you'd have to have like all your
feelers out there and then you find it
and then like people aren't buying that
I'm sure the main reason is because
they're going to have to spend a few
thousand bucks to get it to where they
are still probably a killer deal but
it's friction it's a headache but like
back to your lo location if you're in
Okawa or if you're willing to get there
then jeez Louise and then you just do

[20:01]
then jeez Louise and then you just do
that over and over and over that's right
that's right and it's research you know
whoever does the most
research
wins because whenever I post deals on
there I get tons of comments like that's
not a good deal that's I'm like well
somebody's buying it yeah and you can
easily talk your way out of every deal
but like shoes you know shoes are like
non sexy non-collectible shoes well they
sell for next to nothing as well and
everybody says oh it's a nightmare does
I said well maybe this buyer has a
source that's buying them in the
Philippines and they're paying them X
percentage and they're buying it y
percentage I said you just got to figure
it out what is the Delta and so my last
tech company was Tech restore I sold it
it was my iPhone business and it year
did you start that
200 six something like that
that's early yeah yeah but I was focused

[21:01]
that's early yeah yeah but I was focused
on laptops at that time we started we
convinced DHL to put our laptop box in
every DHL truck in the United States and
so what would happen is if you called us
by 2 pm DHL would come pick up it was
great timing because they had just
bought Airborne Express and they wanted
to expand into uh the us so you called
by 2m we picked up your laptop the same
day brought it in overnight we repaired
it the same day and overnight it back to
you this was before the Apple Store it
was hard to find Reliable places to
repair so it grew and we learned a ton
about logistics and managing this kind
of stuff so that business grew was great
I sold in 2017 they moved it from
California which was a terrible place to
run this business because it's all the
way in the west coast they moved it to
Kentucky which is a smart place to run
it because everything's shipping in and
after I left that sold that business I
said you know what I don't want to
anything with a plug ever again I've

[22:01]
anything with a plug ever again I've
done it so many times you know over and
over and over and so I said let's learn
something new and what do I do and I'd
never really
sold on emotion before and so I like
what's this emotional thing and I just
remember like when I got somehow I
stumbled onto a deal on some designer
handbags Lis Vuitton Prada Gucci all the
stuff and all these ladies at my office
and my wife my they were like going nuts
over these things and I was like man
there's an opportunity here but at the
same time I was having these guys on my
podcast on business brain and they were
doing this thing called social commerce
and I didn't I knew nothing about it I
don't even know what it meant and so I
just like well I'm GNA experiment and
start see if I can start a business on
my phone just using apps all this kind
of stuff and so I started swimming
Upstream you know experimenting Who is
the best in the market selling these

[23:00]
the best in the market selling these
places where is the best place to where
do I Source them where do you sell them
and it took me a year of really digging
in I started buying from everybody
seeing who's selling what how they did
it and then I found a Marketplace that
it was like I came in and I was like a
piranha and everybody else was goldfish
right and I had all the skills from 20
years in business
you know sales marketing packaging
photography customer service yeah and I
was competing against people selling
stuff out of their house and they were
just fat and happy because they weren't
competing with you yet that's right and
so I came in after all this research and
I just blew it up and that that that
market that Marketplace was Poshmark and
so I said okay man this is great and I
hit you know 500,000 in sales like my
first year and then pretty good Mar
awesome margins yeah I that business I

[24:01]
awesome margins yeah I that business I
eventually I got bored with it we talked
about before the show you know but it
did about four four million in sales but
my net was like
$552,000 out of that and it was just me
I didn't have any employees I didn't
work very much on it I worked an hour or
so a day once I got it up and running
and automated a lot of stuff but the key
is
that I guess the point I'm trying to
make is
there's just all these opportunities if
you're willing to dig and swim upstream
and try to figure it out
and you you can do it at night you can
do it as a side hustle you can do it as
a project and see how it works out and
you just don't know where this stuff is
going to lead that's why I love talking
about it on X I know you talk about your
stuff too is it attracts people and it
I'm trying to bust open the door on
reality to so many folks cuz reality is

[25:00]
reality to so many folks cuz reality is
flexible you just don't know where it's
going to lead unless you put in the time
and effort and just don't talk about it
with people because so many people just
say that'll never work they'll
discourage you yeah yeah they'll
discourage you like as as creative as
you and I are are coming up with the
ideas others are just as creative at
coming up with excuses to not try those
ideas oh liability oh Insurance oh
that's not that would never sell no one
would ever buy that like why don't you
try it actually how do you know you
don't know and
yes a lot of times it doesn't work but
how you'll never know unless you put it
out there and so that business took off
and like I said that I got their
attention they invited me to their
headquarters I met the CEO did some you
know Consulting for them they eventually
you know gave me access to their IPO and
you know got it was amazing and I wrote
a book about it and so I was like well
I've always wanted to write a book I
know how to do this you know what's the
name of the book Poshmark unlocked okay
and so it's sold like crazy up on Amazon

[26:01]
and so it's sold like crazy up on Amazon
I learned how to self-publish and do all
this stuff and then I was like well I
know how to do eBay too because I've
done it forever I've spoken at events
and all this kind of stuff for them so I
wrote a book called eBay unlocked and
that went to that was a number one best
seller on Amazon you know and it was
great are you still selling copies of
those today I get royalty checks every
month that's amazing it's the greatest
Roi it is the true passive income so
these books they make net for me what
somebody renting out of house probably
makes every month you know it's like a I
kind of consider each book like a
rental and I'm working on a new book
called escaping employment that this
whole concept of people are taught
incorrectly that it's safer to go work
for somebody else and yeah I just know
that's not true because you're at their
whim a you're talking to a guy that's
had to lay people off you know a bunch
of times when business slows down or

[27:00]
of times when business slows down or
things change nothing stays constant and
so I I'm trying to teach people that you
can be in control of your destiny it's
not that risky if you do it the right
way yeah so when you were flipping if
someone were to say I'm going to flip
handbags that sounds like a no-brainer
is it a completely different opportunity
today or is it
similar it's all about Supply you make
your money on the deal side and on the
buy side so if I researched and I it's
just it's a spreadsheet example it's
like okay I could buy this this Prada
safiano Lux handbag and I can buy it for
$500 okay go to eBay search sold
listings not what they're for sale for
not just completed not for sale but sold
yep because you want to see what they
sold for and you also need to check
velocity how many of them are selling
yeah if you buy a hundred how long will

[28:01]
yeah if you buy a hundred how long will
it take you to move those how long will
it take and so you can do this one at a
time or you can do it like during covid
one of my biggest sources was the cruise
ships because they didn't want to lose
their supplier relationships and the
suppliers were like you got to keep
buying these Handbags and the cruise
ships like well we're not we don't have
any cruises so then they find guys like
me get a phone call Shannon would you
buy 500 of these bags so it's real quick
what what do they sell for the same
thing how long is it going to take me to
sell them yes I'll take them all you
know that kind of thing so I think
there's opportunity in everything you
just have to research it and see is it
value is it worth your time and money
now I took me a year to stumble I didn't
stumble but took me a year to find just
an incredible supplier and I did have a
I would say a exponential boost because
I had that supplier I bought from them
before smaller Deals they just knew who

[29:00]
before smaller Deals they just knew who
I was being credible don't call them or
email and say I want to buy your product
or whatever it's like what do you have
that that no one else will buy sell that
to me don't think about making money at
the beginning think about figuring out
the market and making the relationship
because eventually after you buy that
garbage and I donated it most of it you
eventually you get to you have a
relationship with someone and you say
hey I'm solving this problem for you
what else can you sell me what else can
you sell me especially once you learn
that they're a good vendor right like
yeah I for eight years I sold iPhone
parts from China and all the time people
would ask me like well why are you so
special like why can't and I'm like well
first of all I had to go through 13 bad
vendors to find a good one and I'm not
telling you who he is okay second of all
I flew to China twice to vet my vendors
and to negotiate financing terms third
of all like people are they're hesitant
to order from China like I sold iPhone

[30:01]
to order from China like I sold iPhone
parts to iPhone repair stores they could
literally go to Alibaba and buy those
parts for half the price but it's just
it's friction it's unknown I'm GNA get
scammed and pro they're probably not
going to get scammed honestly but it's
just that barrier is what put me and you
in business right a friction yeah and it
only takes one time to buy especially
computer tech parts or iPhone parts from
China and get a batch that are not as
described which is very common to
realize the power of a vendor and like
right now I share on X all the time like
I buy hand well I'm not that business
anymore but I was buying handbags from
Japan because there's a a massive Market
there and that's another the average
person the consumer because this was a a
b Toc business the average consumer is
not going to buy a bag from an auction
company in Japan not going to happen but
when I come up and put it on Poshmark or

[31:02]
when I come up and put it on Poshmark or
vestier or eBay and I've got an
incredible rating and reviews that are
off the charts and I've been in featured
in the San Francisco Chronicle or
Business Insider and all these kind of
things that build my my my social
credibility that's the Delta so yeah
they could buy it for $300 from this
Japanese auction house that they know
nothing about or they could buy it from
me for $500 or $600 and they and they
definitely do yeah are there any third
party tools that you use to find like
hot items other than just going to
places like GSA Auctions and all that
like do you use any tools or or are you
just curious about something you've
start following that
Curiosity I follow the Curiosity and dig
I used to say I'm a damn good googler
you know and digging deep and deep page
18 you know this kind of stuff back in
there but I have been using AI more to

[32:00]
there but I have been using AI more to
help me parse the data and I've been
like you you can go to places that like
upwork and buy lists of companies and
but now with AI I can say hey here's
this GSA auction site go find me 50
sites that are like this and it's very
good at bringing this stuff together and
I got involved with the US Treasury
auctions based on that because I was
like oh that's similar this kind of
thing so
you can definitely use the AI but I
think it's still are you willing to put
the time in it are you willing to not
watch the next streaming thing on
Netflix at night from 9 to 11: but at
rather sit with your laptop
and research for hours and hours until
you find that one little thing that you
go what's that that's weird how do I
tease that a little bit more and then
you call and they don't want to talk to
you and then you email them and they

[33:00]
you and then you email them and they
don't want and they don't answer you and
then you just keep doing that till
finally oh okay I got Best Buy that way
they ignored us forever and then finally
I was just like hey I'm G to be I just
flew out to their place where I knew
that they were doing this and I said hey
I'm in town can I just meet you for
lunch and I just said hey I had another
appointment but I didn't I was just
there to try to meet this one guy you
know and I did the same with GameStop I
wanted their business I wanted their
return you just have to make yourself
known and sometimes you have to be a
pest a little bit and it works it works
it's interesting I feel like either your
brain has to be sick and hardwired like
ours are or like you have to somehow
learn to find joy in spending three
hours researching auction websites
instead of watching Netflix with your
wife because like I love it I'll be
doing it when I'm 91 years old I do it
today like it feels like retirement This
research is the funnest part yeah it is
fun and when you find something I'm

[34:02]
fun and when you find something I'm
always just like look check this out you
know and some people like oh that's cool
but if you're a deal person I'm just
like hey you could buy this I'm always
sending stuff to my friends I'm just
like look you could yeah like you
mentioned my our place in Tahoe well
you'd be damn sure I got a good deal on
that place yeah of course and I could
tell you a story about how I got the
deal how'd you get the deal I want to
hear it yeah so keep going you know
sometimes I'm a lowballer but we look at
all these places and and I like okay
well yeah we're going to buy this I'm
going to pay cash for this place and
I've got to rent it out because I I just
have to have some kind of return on my
investment I just go crazy if it just
sits there and yes I wanted the
depreciation and all that stuff so I
asked the agent I said what's the
opportunity how many rentals are there
oh she's like oh wow there's three 4,000
rentals well how many three bedroom two
baths and she's like oh there's 2500 of
those I like well I don't want to buy
one of those and then we just kept going
how many four bedrooms how many and then
we got to how many six bedroom houses

[35:01]
we got to how many six bedroom houses
there were and I said how many are those
for rent she looks up she's like 50 yeah
I said well let's buy one of those you
know it's another spreadsheet and so I
was like okay can we find places that
were sold that fell out of escrow it's
just another way to parse it down and
she's like yeah so we found four or five
houses and then I went to one and I I
was like can we find a place that the
people live out of state because that's
another friction point they they're not
there and they wanted so I found this
house currently own it there's people
own in Texas and it just turned out that
some you know kid had fallen out the
third story window and landed in the
driveway and just like well that's got
to be nuts you know they got to make you
want to get rid of it that's terrible
ter don't get me wrong it's they they
the kid was okay the kid was okay okay
good good good but there's your
opportunity so let's go hit let's make a
let's start the floor so I make a very
low offer this was back when you could I

[36:01]
low offer this was back when you could I
bought it in I bought in 2013 so I just
offered a low number and I like I'll pay
cash and we can close in a week and I
thought we would negotiate from there
but it turned out they just said yes wow
and then when I wanted a fishing cabin I
I love to fish I wanted a place on a
river I kept looking looking looking I
kept looking at this one house and none
of the real estate AG like oh you don't
want to buy that place it's there's a
problem there's a problem problem like
you're like that sounds like opportunity
what's the problem he like well the
government wants to buy that house I
like well why don't I buy it and I can
sell it to the government and I posted
about that on X I bought it I offered
them half what they wanted they took it
and you know I put a little bit of money
into it I owned it for five years and
then I sold it to the US government for
three times what I paid for it and I got
to fish all the time so that's amazing
if if you to your point about finding
things if you can fall in love with
problem solving
that's the opportunity what is the

[37:00]
that's the opportunity what is the
problem that we're trying to solve for
people and I I know you do it too I read
all your stuff um so it's fun I I really
enjoy it all right that's all the time
we had today for Shannon check back in
in one week and we will finish up this
conversation have a great day
