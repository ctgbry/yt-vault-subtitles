look at this freaking thing right here
what a brilliant business idea they will
pay you $10,000 if you get a hole in one
on their 110 yard floating green and
they pay people out once every 2 weeks
on average I'm going to use statistics
to break down how much profit this
business makes and then I'll tell you
how you can copy it so an amateur golfer
has a one in 12,000 chance of making a
whole in one on a par three like this
one and this company has said that they
pay out $10,000 every two weeks which
means they have 26 hole in ones every
year so if you take 12,000 tries
multiplied by 26 hole in per year you
get over 300,000 balls hit per year but
that one in 12,000 number is for an
amateur golfer not a casual golfer which
most of their customers are I would bet
it's more like 1 in 20,000 and if the
average customer hits 20 balls for about
20 bucks it means their Topline revenue
is about 650 Grand and this place is
making a net profit of $2 to $300,000
per year these should be all over
America all you need is a wooden kiosk a
floating tea and some permission Why not
start a business where math is on your
side it's better than Top Golf what do
