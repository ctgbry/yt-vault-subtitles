Elon said you can either do a lot of
good for a small amount of people or a
little good for a large amount of people
and I will tell you personally it's way
harder to do a little good for a lot of
people than a lot of good for a small
amount of people there is a reason that
Tesla started at the top they started
only selling to rich people that they
had the Roadster which is
$250,000 get in trouble because they're
they're like I have to keep moving the
goal post but if the goal post is to
play then you win by playing and so for
that re like sure we set goals for the
company but like I'm 1,000% super
motivated and at the same time if we
never hit I'm just going to be happy
that I was able to play I also know that
in three generations everyone will
forget who I
am and so one of my favorite quotes is
the work works on you more than you work
on it and so if you want to be the best
in the world at something you do the
work to become the best in the world and
the work works on you and so I mean
there's a there's a a Biblical proverb I
think it says like um there is there is
profit in all labor

[01:00]
profit in all labor
so I Define learning by same condition
new behavior and so when you go to a
video game and you battle through the
level and you battle the boss if you
keep doing the same thing to the boss
and you keep losing then you have not
learned because you have the same
condition and the same behavior if you
want to sell based on value in terms of
low
cost you need to build the
infrastructure for huge amounts of
demand because the only way that you
make money selling to poor people is
selling tons and tons and tons of them
look at what Walmart look at Amazon
these are businesses that were built for
volume day one and they win on
efficiency you have the potential to
make a shitload of money or lose a ton
of money because you didn't check your
math and so the more I've been
reinforced for thinking independently
and in the beginning it's on small
things and then you just continue to
reinforce that cycle of huh I came to
this conclusion on my own it seems
different than everyone else's but I
think I think my thing makes sense so
I'm going to do that we are all one
decision away from changing our lives
forever and a lot of us don't even know
it and the difference between the

[02:00]
it and the difference between the
decisions you make today and the ones
that you made last year if they've
gotten you to where you are right now
they were not good decisions and so if
we want to have more power in our lives
we have to first understand what power
is and second how to unlock it through
the actions and decisions that we make
my triple shift is I get I go to dinner
and I come back at 7:30 then I work from
7:30 until 11:30 or 1 or whatever right
and when I'm putting in triple shifts is
when I know I'm like really gassing it
um and that's that's when I'm like
repeatedly doing 16 17 a day of actual
productive work a lot of us surround
ourselves or at least I did when I was
starting out surround ourselves with
people who are very poor and we listen
to their advice on how to be rich and
they have no idea what they are doing
and we also listen to their judgment on
why our idea is stupid even though they
are poor so what would they know and so
this is just to visual put this in
context 90% of businesses never hit a
million dollars a year in sales 90%
doesn't look that way on Instagram but
this is the this is thead but this

[03:01]
this is the this is thead but this
person is saying you shouldn't do that
you need to be doing X Y and Z blah blah
blah blah blah and then you feel like
you need to compromise your dreams for
that person the problem is that you put
your power of your destiny in their
hands and you're asking for permission
instead of support right because at the
end of the day if you don't accomplish
your dreams and you did it because of
them who do you think you're going to
resent just because it's your mom or
it's your brother or your best friend
growing up or that guy who you hired
first has been with you since the
beginning it still doesn't mean that
they're right for the role it won't get
harder
like this is the hardest part and so if
you can just make it through this
everything else is downhill it's not
that the things that you're the dragons
are going to slay aren't going to get
bigger they are but you become so much
more equipped to slay them back and you
have so many more allies you have people
in the stands cheering for you the sign
of success is the hate that you get
along the way and what you can't do is
bend the knee to their hate and fit back
into the Conformity because it's
comfortable and it's warm because like
in The Matrix when Trinity opens the

[04:00]
in The Matrix when Trinity opens the
door when when Neo's about to go take
the red pill and he wants to get out of
the car she says Neo you've been down
that road and you know exactly where it
leads I think the like the on line
summary for me was that like I felt like
I had to let my dad's dream die for mine
to live and I felt like my entire life
it had always up to that point had been
like go to the school do these studies I
mean it's it's a common thing like it's
not like I had something that a lot of
people don't have many people and to be
fair I'm very grateful for the skills
discipline Etc that that instill if you
have a company or a business or a job
where you need to influence other people
or you need to get people to say yes or
you need people to make decisions or
most importantly make decisions for
yourself that are going to change your
life for the better then we have to
understand what the topic means
character traits if you think about this
you're like I want to become patient
patient is just a general term for lots
of little skills and so if you want to
become more patient you want to do
things that patient people do and that
means that if I can train someone to
become more patient then patience is a
skill the I think the true test of
whether you're quote perfectionist or

[05:00]
whether you're quote perfectionist or
not is if everyone else in the room says
it's exceptional and then you
say but I'll know it's not because I
don't think it's exceptional yet if you
still break what everyone else believes
is beautiful so that you can make the
thing that you make it the way you want
it to make or make it the way you want
it to be I think that is probably like
the the truest test of whether or not
you really do value your own opinion
always hiring ahead of where you're at
and for people who don't like their
current business I can promise you that
if you grow it enough you're just going
to be dealing with people all businesses
at the top are you got a marketing
person you got a salesperson you got a
product person you got Finance you got
legal you got Tech and that's that's the
business and so whether you're selling
widgets you're selling services you're
selling software fundamentally you're
just going to have a bunch of people
that are executing those things and so
at the very highest levels business is
all the same you I would definitely say
it comes down to skills um and and if
we're just defining skills as things

[06:02]
we're just defining skills as things
that you do when introduced to some sort
of external stimulus that gets them
outcome and I think simplifying a lot of
the wooow woo around mindset performance
confidence like all of that stuff if you
can boil it down to at the end of the
day even identity right all it is is a
list of behaviors that we do power is
neutral you can be incredibly powerful
and bad incredibly powerful and good and
so the idea is if we can harness power
then it amplifies who we are and if
we're shitty people then we're very very
shitty people and we're very good we're
very very good and so I hope that all of
us aspire to have more power in our
lives I would say that there's there are
absolutely trade-offs and it's just
whether or not you're willing to pay the
price for it and I think then we we can
we can take off the label of like this
is good this is bad this is healthy this
is unhealthy and just simply say like if
the Nikes that you want on the wall are
$500 that is the price you can just
choose to pay it or not but if you
choose to pay the $500 for the Nikes you
don't then say this was unhealthy or

[07:01]
don't then say this was unhealthy or
this was bad or you label it you just
make the trade so when someone says when
someone objects to something it's like
hauh that's so weird I wouldn't have
thought that tell me more about that
right and you get to be able to maintain
that childlike curiosity the same way
they train fighters to not breathe too
much during a fight through exposure the
more more times you get into these
uncomfortable high stakes closing
scenarios the less weird and high high
stakes they become because they become
what you do every day like a lot of
great CEOs are lazy that's fine um let's
use that and so let's just make working
more convenient than the other thing and
then your laziness will take over you
know I mean just like in terms of how we
can frame the problem right like as a as
an example you're saying earlier with
the iPhone um like scientific study
anyone can do this you can decrease your
iPhone usage by simply going to
grayscale it was thinking that
a requisite for success is a problem

[08:03]
a requisite for success is a problem
like you cannot become the wealthiest
man in the world and not get sued like
getting sued is a is an indicator that
you're actually is a is a requisite for
being there there's no no person has
been there without this and so reframing
what I used to consider a problem as a
as a point of evidence that I am on the
path that I originally chose I I'm a big
believer in working smarter not harder
with the massive caveat that you have to
work incredibly hard to get smart yeah
we all have to pay down the most
expensive debt that we all pay every day
which is the debt of not knowing
ignorance debt people consider like
leadership to be like a fofu or like
communication skills is like soft stuff
right sales metric you know like we have
all these metrics driven things versus
this and it's just because it's harder
to measure doesn't make it less
important and that was that was a big
realization for me is that it was just
because it was harder for me to measure

[09:00]
because it was harder for me to measure
but it doesn't make it less important
