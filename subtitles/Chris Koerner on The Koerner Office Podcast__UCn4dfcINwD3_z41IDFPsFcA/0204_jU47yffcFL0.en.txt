so 90% of human beings have a
fundamental problem that can be solved
with this one analogy so for my whole
life I hated mowing the lawn I hired a
lawn guy for the last decade and I
didn't even think about it until a few
months ago I bought a riding mower and
now I get outside almost every night to
mow the lawn even when it doesn't need
to be mowed I love it it's fun it feels
like a game and it saves me money and
it's productive and it teaches my kids
how to work and it's like it's the
perfect overlap of all these good
qualities I love it it saves me money
it's enjoyable and it's good right so
think about the relationship or the job
that you're in that you don't love cuz
most people are in that situation we
live in a world now where you don't have
to stay in that forever you can be
curious and try a ton of different
things in your free time okay so find
the overlap of something that the world
needs something that you love and
something that you can charge money for
and you won't know what it is until you
chase every shiny object and try all the
things follow me for more ideas like
