[00:00]
All right. So, I had this guy come
detail my car today, and I wanted to ask
him how much money he's making. How much
money did you spend starting this
detailing business? How much money do
you make every week? How do you find
customers? What are your marketing
costs? What can people learn from you?
What should people avoid? All of those
details and more. I got to go find out.
Let's see what we learn.
All right, man. What's your name? Joel
Cruz. And where do you live? Riverway,
Texas. What's the name of your business?
F Cruz. And how long you been in
business? Been in business since January
1st. So, 8 months. What made you want to
start it on January 1st of all base?
&gt;&gt; Due to un unfortunate circumstances, I
lost my job at the beginning of the
year. So, yeah, forced me to pick a side
hustle and a telego detailing and I just
stuck with it since. What was your job?
&gt;&gt; It was a server job at a seafood
restaurant. And why did you lose it?
&gt;&gt; I was trying to be a nice guy and give a
guy a free shot and uh fortunately they
didn't like that.
&gt;&gt; Free food is free shots.
&gt;&gt; All right. So, what kind of planted the
seed for this business? What got you
thinking along? Have had you done it on
the side in the past or
&gt;&gt; Yes. So during that server job, I was

[01:00]
&gt;&gt; Yes. So during that server job, I was
doing this on the side. The way I really
got into it is I had a BMW. You know,
it's a black BMW as you can tell. Picks
up a lot of dirt. It's dirty really
quick. So I would have to clean it every
so often, every week. And I just fell in
love with the process.
&gt;&gt; You liked it?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it was satisfying.
&gt;&gt; So what was the game plan? What did you
do on January 1st to get this business
started?
&gt;&gt; Well, I sat down, thought about it,
decided what equipment I needed, and I
just started buying equipment. you know,
little by little started building myself
building myself up from the ground up.
Started some business cards and then I
just left those business cards in
people's cars and that's basically how I
started off. Where did you leave these
business cards? I started at like
high-end malls like North Fork area
other places around here and I just left
those cards and people just started
hitting me up. Okay. So, you just go to
like Vista Print or whatever. You design
some generic business cards. Your first
thought is to go to the mall and to put
them Were you putting them on specific
cars like nicer cars? Yeah. Okay. For
sure.
&gt;&gt; Were you putting them on dirty cars or
was that irrelevant to you?
&gt;&gt; No, I I put them on all cars, but Okay.

[02:00]
&gt;&gt; No, I I put them on all cars, but Okay.
More more towards the nicer cars, the
well-maintained cars. Yeah. Cuz people,
they like to keep their stuff full.
&gt;&gt; How many did you put on cars? Do you
remember?
&gt;&gt; I want to say 250 cars, 300 parts.
&gt;&gt; How long did that take?
&gt;&gt; Couple days. I want to say a week.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Just like a little bit a day.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, just a little bit a day.
&gt;&gt; And how many calls would you say those
250 brought you?
&gt;&gt; I only got about two people.
&gt;&gt; Two people. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So 1%.
&gt;&gt; 1%. Not terrible, actually. But you were
probably pretty disappointed by that.
&gt;&gt; I was. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You're crunching the numbers like if I
only get 10% each job's $250, you know,
I make thousands of dollars. And then
you were a little disheartened. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Was it two jobs or two phone calls that
you got?
&gt;&gt; I got one job and then one phone call.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; That one job landed me some high-profile
clients, which uh scaled up my business
from there.
&gt;&gt; What do you mean by high-profile
clients? So it was in the North Park
area around the Highland Park, Preston
Hollow area. And uh as the lady that I
got, the one phone call, her house was
uh on the end of the street. So people
would walk by, walk their dogs, and they
would see my job. And then this one guy,

[03:01]
would see my job. And then this one guy,
he just walked by randomly. He was just
like, "I need my my Porsche 9/11 hand
clean." Yeah. And one day he passed by.
He didn't speak to me. But then the
following month cuz the lady was getting
the monthly service done. The guy
decided to stop by and actually speak to
me. That's when I landed the job right
then and there. From there, he gave me
other clients of his or other friends of
his that are now clients of mine. How
much did you charge that first lady and
how did you decide on that price? The
first lady I charged $100 cuz her car
was fairly clean. Okay. And uh she gets
it done every month.
&gt;&gt; Do you still charge that or have your
prices gone up? for standard like
cleaning like these or is 110 but
monthly services are 100 bucks. Okay.
&gt;&gt; For every cube. That seems pretty low.
Are you kind of on the lower end of the
market as far as price is concerned?
&gt;&gt; For say in the middle.
&gt;&gt; So, how much did you charge for that
guy's Porsche?
&gt;&gt; For the Porsche, I charged them 80
bucks.
&gt;&gt; 80 bucks?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Wow.
&gt;&gt; Cuz it's a coupe, so it was a two-seater
and uh it was hardly anything. It wasn't
really dirty.
&gt;&gt; How long did it take you to do it?
&gt;&gt; An hour or so? Hour, two hours.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Cuz that guy's probably getting

[04:01]
&gt;&gt; Okay. Cuz that guy's probably getting
quotes for two to 300 to clean it,
right? So, you quot him 100, he's happy,
and you're over here thinking, I'm
making 80 bucks an hour. Like, it's a
win-win, right? And then as you get more
busy, you can start going up on price,
right? Okay. So, two phone calls, one of
them did not turn into a job. No.
&gt;&gt; And the other one did, and then that
turned into more jobs. How did you get
your next customers after that?
&gt;&gt; After that, I started making better
business cards, and I just started
handing those out. My business was based
off of word of mouth. So, it was just
friends, family that were just giving me
jobs. And then from there I became
reliable source for them. So okay,
&gt;&gt; more people just started aiming towards
me.
&gt;&gt; When did you go list yourself on
Thumbtac cuz that's where I found you
some months ago.
&gt;&gt; Okay. How has that gone so far?
&gt;&gt; So far I've had a handful of jobs.
&gt;&gt; Just like a half dozen or so.
&gt;&gt; Half dozen.
&gt;&gt; How much do you have to pay Thumbtac for
those jobs?
&gt;&gt; I want to say $10 a lead. Just depending
on the service they pick.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Full service I know it's about
$125 for a lead and then uh just
interior only it's about $8 $10. Okay.

[05:00]
interior only it's about $8 $10. Okay.
And what percentage of those leads are
you closing?
&gt;&gt; We'll say about half of those. So like
$30 to acquire a customer, give or take.
&gt;&gt; Okay. How much did all of your equipment
cost? Give or take about I would say
$4,000.
&gt;&gt; $4,000. But you bought it over time,
right? Yes. If someone wanted to start
this with like bare minimum, what do
they have to have?
&gt;&gt; I would say pressure washer for sure.
Gets the outside clean. It's easier. A
vacuum. Vacuum and a pressure washer.
&gt;&gt; Would like a$1 to $200 I pressure washer
do the trick or do you need more than
that? Oh, what?
&gt;&gt; Yep. That's what I run. Uh,
&gt;&gt; okay. And that's still good today.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Cuz some people would say, "Oh,
that's not that's not good enough.
That's not going to get But you're
saying no, it's it's great." Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, out the door, someone wants to start
doing this. How much money do they need?
&gt;&gt; Let's say you could start off with 500
bucks.
&gt;&gt; 500 bucks?
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Okay. And then what do you think before
you having to hire employees?
&gt;&gt; Well, right now, monthly, I'm going to
say I'm making roughly $5,000 a month.
&gt;&gt; Wow. Okay. Awesome. And how how many
hours per week are you working? 40 hours
a week.
&gt;&gt; So you could scale if you wanted to
start hiring people and then you open a

[06:01]
start hiring people and then you open a
whole other can of worms right now.
Where are you getting all of your
customers from today? You're are you
still doing the business cards on cars?
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Really? So 1% was your first response
rate. What does it average over the long
term?
&gt;&gt; I mean I give out my car for the most
part. I I land that job right then and
there.
&gt;&gt; What do you mean? Like how many cars do
you have to put your card on to get one
job?
&gt;&gt; I would say about 10 cars. 10 cars.
&gt;&gt; So 10%. Why was it only 1% to start? I
guess cuz I didn't have like social
media.
&gt;&gt; Okay. You didn't have like a reputation.
&gt;&gt; I didn't have a reputation.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, now that you have like case
studies, testimonials, before and after
pictures, your response rate has gone up
10x.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; What types of cars have you learned to
target for? Like what have you learned
about targeting the right types of cars
for these business cards?
&gt;&gt; The customer base I want is high-end
clients. Yeah. I go for exotic cars.
Don't get me wrong, I still do any type
of car. My target is the exotic cars.
Are you doing just cars or trucks or
anything that's higher end?
&gt;&gt; Trucks. I do 4x4s, dies, and stuff like
that. Yeah. And then uh SUVs like

[07:00]
that. Yeah. And then uh SUVs like
Escalades and Yukons and stuff like
that.
&gt;&gt; What are some things you learned the
hard way in this business that other
people could avoid?
&gt;&gt; I would say don't take every job.
&gt;&gt; What are some signs to look out for on
jobs people should avoid?
&gt;&gt; Depending on the client, you know, you
can
&gt;&gt; just the vibe of the client.
&gt;&gt; Just the vibe of the client, for sure.
&gt;&gt; Is there a correlation between like a
really messy car and a bad client? Yeah,
you can just sort it. So, they say it's
not that bad and Yeah. Open the door and
it's trash everywhere. There's Burl with
a car.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. What's next for the
business? What's your goal for it?
&gt;&gt; I want to shoot for 10K a month.
&gt;&gt; Are you going to have to hire people to
do that?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Where are you going to find them?
&gt;&gt; Probably.
&gt;&gt; What do you hate the most about this
business?
&gt;&gt; I really don't hate anything about it.
The laundry.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Just washing towels. That's
probably the worst part about it.
&gt;&gt; It's funny. You don't mind like
scrubbing cars out in the 100°ree heat,
but you hate washing towels in the air
conditioning. That's funny. What do you
love about it the most? the people that
I meet.
&gt;&gt; Okay. For sure. Cars are cool and all,
but it's the people that I get to meet
and the relationship I get to have with
these people.
&gt;&gt; That's awesome. Any words of motivation
or advice to young entrepreneurs out

[08:00]

there?
&gt;&gt; Just get after it daily.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And just be 1% better every day.

&gt;&gt; 21. That's amazing. Good for you. How
did you afford your truck?
&gt;&gt; This is actually my father's truck.
&gt;&gt; Okay, that's awesome. What's the name of
your business again?
&gt;&gt; Clean Cruise. What's your website?
&gt;&gt; Don't have a website.
&gt;&gt; Oh, you got to you got to change that.
&gt;&gt; Not yet.
