mortgage leads are super expensive
hundreds of dollars there are thousands
of real estate investing Facebook groups
thousands you can get them for 10 203
cents and you're just middleman and you
only start buying them once you've
already sold them to someone if you're
not a mortgage broker and listening to
this which I would imagine is 99.4% of
you here's exactly how you could make
money with
[Music]
this last week I went to what is now my
favorite city in the world which is
called Nashville Tennessee really okay I
love Nashville I'm all in on Nashville
all right and I'm I'm leading into this
because it it gave me some business idea
some inspo right it gave me this shirt I
walk into this hipster shop and I see
this shirt and it had to be mine have
you spent any time in Asheville I've
never I've never been in Ashville I've
heard cool things about it like it's one
of the I think it's one of the top
cities that people are moving to in the
South it's blown up uh good economy and
I lived an hour and a half from it for
years in Huntsville but we never really
spent much time there we would drive up
there to fly out of it but I never spent

[01:01]
there to fly out of it but I never spent
much time really that's really close
it's close I spent a lot of time Walking
in Memphis oh interesting yeah walking
M I would say you're in the top 1% of
people that quote that song on a regular
basis so I went to Nashville over the
spring to meet with Aaron Harper Aaron
Harper of rolling Suds and he took me to
Broadway which is like what you do in
Nashville it's where all the music music
scene is and I loved it and we were only
there for like an hour and I just got a
little taste but I'm like I I got to
come back so Jesse and I went for three
days and let me tell you about Nashville
Nashville's got Broadway from the river
to 17th Street but Broadway Broadway is
only like four blocks and on Broadway
you've got Honky Tonk Bar restaurant
Honky Tonk Bar restaurant that's all
you've got you just got bars and
restaurants a little bit of shopping
every single bar has a stage like it's

[02:00]
every single bar has a stage like it's
state law and many of the bars have
multiple levels with multiple stages in
different bands playing 24/7 all at the
same time and so like you're a music guy
I'm a music guy for a music lover it's
just incredible because you don't have
to like like people think Nashville
Country it's just music period what is a
honky tonk I I don't know what that is I
grew up in California sure sure I think
it's just a bar for rednecks I don't
know really it's a bar for white people
I don't know how else to describe it
like it's a bar that plays country live
country music maybe like if you ask me
what a vato was it's like okay I'm in
dude I'm in Ms it's like I know what
that guy is but a freaking Honky Tonk I
couldn't tell you like what does that
mean is it a like a place where you just
honk your horn on your it's weird keep
like if you ask me what a Mexican pizza
or a Crunch Wrap gordita is you're like
naming all these Taco Bell
names like a double decker Taco it's
like my favorite is like when they wrap
the bean burrito on the outside of the
crunchy hard taco go okay any so you're

[03:02]
crunchy hard taco go okay any so you're
just walking along the street and
there's tons of people everywhere and
you just hear music coming out of every
door and window the weather's pretty
good in Nashville it was great when we
were there and it's just fun it's just a
Vibe it's just a Vibe okay okay okay and
then the whole time Broadway you've got
these party buses driving up and down
Broadway you've got one that's that
looks like it's camo one that looks like
a duckboat all these themed party buses
some have Poes on them you can dance on
yeah and people are just dancing and
they're singing and everyone's wearing
cowboy hats and cowboy boots and it's
just it's a Vibe I don't know how else
to say it okay all right it's a Vibe so
it gave me some business ideas can we
start calling it Nash Vegas that's not a
that's I mean that's already a thing
that's already what they call it oh is
it really I'm such a going I'm
sorry I hate myself you probably heard
it before okay yeah all right let me
tell you how it works when you go into a
bar or restaurant but let me back up
best two bar and restaurants on Broadway

[04:01]
best two bar and restaurants on Broadway
I'm probably the biggest sellout for
saying this it's kid rocks and it's
Justin timberlakes okay the two greatest
musicians of our time I mean can we be
real ball with the ball the bang the
bang D I mean come on Chris is there
anything better than that song yeah and
they bars are amazing yeah I facetimed
you at Kid Rock's Bar and it was a Vibe
wasn't it it was a Vibe it was amazing
here's what's funny you got two Mormons
talking about the best bars in Nashville
I know never tasted alcohol in in my
life which just goes to show that if you
do it would be even better right Nick I
tell you what the best bar in
Nashville Kid Rocks
Bar I mean he's the greatest mus
musician of our time
right okay so this is how it works you
walk into a bar any bar and the musician
is gonna have a five gallon bucket on
the stage with a QR code and it says
like hey ven Momi 20 bucks that's the
price market price I don't care where

[05:00]
price market price I don't care where
you go 20 bucks and I'll play whatever
you want and so youve got the sweet
Carolines you got the Don't Stop
Believing you've got the thunder struck
you hear a lot of the same stuff but
then you hear a lot of like really
beautiful medley like Creed you know I
mean the second greatest musician of
our there it
[Music]
is I don't know what to do while you
sing I don't know what to do I don't
know what to do with my hands dude we're
talking about we both love music I can't
sing I'm sorry I think in lyrics we
start talking about Creed I gotta sing
it I don't know what you want me to say
if that's a crime just that's a crime
I'm sorry book me
officer so okay I'm a cheap skate right
$20 that's like two Chipotle meals or
1.8 now but think about it this way Nick
everyone that comes to Nashville is a
music it's like it's like LA right you
go to La you want to act you want to do
music you also go to La but you can go
to Nashville too okay right right and so

[06:02]
to Nashville too okay right right and so
there's some real talent I did not hear
one bad band one bad singer one bad
musician not even mediocre everyone's
amazing because there's such a high
concentration of musicians there and so
to think that you can merely pull out
your phone scan the QR code send 20
bucks and you can have a private concert
you can have them play whatever you want
on demand and there's usually not much
of a Quee or waiting list for whatever
reason so you just pay 20 bucks play
whatever you want and so I had him play
I was at this first bar and I said play
Carry On My Wayward Son by Kansas oh my
gosh he
[Music]
at it's it's gonna happen every song you
name I'm just gonna have to do it that's
fine that's fine and so usually with
these songs he gets a requests he's like
all right John wants me to play Don't
Stop Believing then he plays it but this
one they have like a secret microphone
where he talks to his other band members
he's like hey guys this guy wants to
Don't Stop Believing I don't know I
don't it's like a freaking tough song
you've got a big range in there you've

[07:00]
you've got a big range in there you've
got guitar solos he's like all right
guys this is like my nightmare we got
Chris Chris raise your hand I raised my
he's like man this guy wants us to play
carry on my wward son everyone's like
yeah I love that song guys that's like a
really hard song I attempted it once
completely failed we're gonna try
it long story short he did it he crushed
it we're Instagram friends now and it
was a Vibe okay that's amazing it's
amazing so then we went to Justin
timberlakes bar and I'm not going to lie
I spent more on songs than I spent on
food okay I was just it was like 20
bucks here 20 bucks there like what the
general public does at strip clubs with
dollar bills I do with songs in Nash
Vegas done everything I requested they
play everything you know what I was
surprised you sent me a video of gosh
what's the name of what's the name of
the song the Alabama song I hadn't play
that Dixie Land Delight I couldn't
believe that and they played it well
like they knew Dixie Land Delight they
did and everyone in the crowd was
singing the Alabama Parts I know you're

[08:02]
singing the Alabama Parts I know you're
like everyone in the crowd was singing
the Alabama Parts it was just you and
Jesse it was me it was me my last dollar
on
bear never tried
it could this be a thing I'm calling at
custom concerts any city in the world
you get a band in there that's talented
they've got a whole repertoire of songs
they can just play there's there's no
shortage of them and you go to a concert
and there could be like an auction or a
bidding system where maybe it's 20 bucks
maybe it's five it depends on what the
supply and the demand is and it's like a
silent auction you the the venmo
settings are turned to private and
you're like I really wanted to play this
song and it it looks like there's a line
maybe you can see how How deep the line
is and the highest bid goes to the top
of the line and the musicians can make
money the organizer who puts all this
together can make money maybe he just
makes a percentage of the song request
maybe there's like a $5 $10 uh door fee
what do you think so first first of all
I'm in I love the idea but second it

[09:03]
I'm in I love the idea but second it
sounds like you're just describing a bar
in Nashville like that's just what a bar
is Absol like maybe maybe there's a
drink minimum like that isn't that what
it sounds like I'm describing like a
really unique concept that's hyper
localized to one area that you could
bring to another area I know what I'm
saying is I think that these exist in
every major city yeah there's not enough
of them when was the last time you went
to one to be fair this is two Mormons
talking about bars yeah I've done the
research there's nothing like this in
like the DFW suburbs I can go to Dallas
proper and go to a bar but if I had the
opportunity to go to a restaurant that
also had a live band where I could
request money and the food was decent I
would absolutely do it it's the same
concept of Studio Movie Grill like
ordering good food while watching a
movie the DFW is like a mecca for that
and it's just starting to kind of go
outside of DFW but it's just combining
types of entertainment and systemizing
it so it doesn't even have to be a
restaurant like you could just rent a

[10:01]
restaurant like you could just rent a
venue and it's kind of like they have
touring cover bands like Dave Matthews
Band Beatles All they have touring cover
bands it's kind of like that but for any
type of music you would want it's almost
the same thing it's a little bit of a
riff on it the most you and I love
karaoke fre we just love karaoke it's so
much fun you sing belt out your favorite
songs the most fun I've ever had at
karaoke is karaoke with a live band dude
that could be an aspect of it you know
what I say
uh the darkness oh okay you hit those
timeouts dude it was it was so fun yeah
I think if you combine like made it even
more experiential like okay yeah you can
pay to have them play the song but you
kick an extra
50 hey Rhonda from the back you can come
in and sing with us right like it it
makes it even more experiential I I
still kind of go back to like so
essentially this would be a feature of

[11:00]
essentially this would be a feature of
either a bar or just just a venue no no
like you wouldn't to a
bar no I wouldn't like to me this is
like a candl light concert or a bingo
Loco it's something for Millennials to
do on the weekend and you don't need to
own a venue you don't need to lease a
venue you just find a venue and rent it
for that one night right like our friend
Alex the wedding guy he he hosts candle
light concerts it's a it's a 20 30 $50
million company and all they do is they
bring in a Pianist and some fake candles
they light the candles or they turn the
candles on sit there and they listen to
piano so it's kind of like candle light
concerts but custom concerts so to your
point you'd have to find a band in each
market that is not only talented but has
a big repertoire like they know a bunch
of songs you probably have to whittle
down the catalog and then what would you
do the marketing or would you go to the
venue and say hey I'm putting this
together you do the marketing you do the
marketing so you you have to find a band

[12:01]
marketing so you you have to find a band
in a market to prove the concept but
once you find it just an amazing band
you go on tour then it's like a bingol
loco you just set up all these events
Facebook ads that's how bingol Loco
candal like concerts all these
Millennial stuff grow is just with
Facebook ads okay you keep you keep
saying bingol Loco I don't know what
that means oh you must not consume my
content it's Bingo Loco is just like
it's like a dance party combined with
Bingo neon light music food drinks super
expensive and these these guys make like
it's like 50 to $200,000 a night with
it's just Bingo I'm caught up I love the
idea here's my question is there a way
you could piggyback this idea you know
how we've talked in the past of finding
a distribution one of the ways is by
piggybacking would this be something
piggy back off of yeah you pigy back off
Bing a loco it's like hey for extra 20
bucks stay around for another hour or
two once we're done for custom concerts

[13:01]
two once we're done for custom concerts
little partnership yeah that' be super
smart we'll help cover your door fee I
love it it's music it's Timeless it's
live music and it's what you want to
hear and then you got all these people
singing what you just requested it's
just a Vibe you wouldn't get it I
wouldn't do it at a bar either because
I'd want to bring my kids you know how
fun that would be to like bring Roy and
Otto and like just listen how funny
would it be if like the bands like all
of a sudden they look down at their
phones they're like what the what the
heck I don't I don't think you're
allowed to do that Perry grip the Poo po
poooo PE PE song he just he just looks
back at the drummer and he's like all
right let's do this thing one two three
baby
shark baby
shark that would be amazing that would
be so funny it would be amazing anyways
yeah I love it all right here's four
ideas for you to choose from it's a a
newsletter idea I know we've talked
about those but I have a new one
something to do with the silver

[14:00]
something to do with the silver
tsunami reminders
recommendations let's go newsletter idea
because I've got a a newsletter idea
that I could add to okay so I know we've
talked a lot about newsletters but I
dude I'm just I'm obsessed with
newsletters I think that they're so
freaking cool I had Jaz on jazz on my my
podcast and he talked about his local
newsletter it's in a small town in
Canada and he's just freaking exploded
and the reason I'm so interested in them
is because the economics blow my mind
it's like spend $1 to2 to acquire a
customer and then the LTV of that
customer is like 50 so you've got this
50 to1 or or 25 to1 LTV to CAC ratio
when typically a 3 to1 LTV to CAC ratio
would be incredible right so I love that
part of the business model and to what
we were just talking about I love that
things are getting local and
experiential and I think that having a
local newsletter local local newsletter
accomplishes both both of those things
mhm mhm so there are kind of three broad

[15:03]
mhm mhm so there are kind of three broad
categories in my mind and you can tell
me if I'm wrong of newsletters there's a
newsletter around a brand so that would
that could be a business it could be a
person it could be a uh whatever there's
a a newsletter around a niche topic like
AI um and there's there can be
newsletters around geography and
sometimes you can like mix and match
those but did I get the three broad
categories I would add the one that I
was thinking of first is like a personal
like a Blog newsletter which is kind of
a thing like hey here's what I'm buying
here's what I'm doing here's what I'm
building yeah that in my mind that's the
brand right like Chris Kerner is a brand
like hey this is it you're more like
interested in that in that person or
that brand or that company as opposed to
the specific idea or this anyways yeah
okay we can add that so I've been
thinking about this a lot and we've
talked a couple of times about launching
an AI automation agency but two things
are happening local businesses do not
know the first thing about Ai and we're

[16:01]
know the first thing about Ai and we're
in a Twitter bubble because everyone
knows about it on Twitter but that is
not representative that is not
representative of local businesses and I
would say most local businesses are not
on newsletters they're not like oh
you're Prime newsletter subscribers so I
still think you launch the AI automation
agency but the way that I would do it is
I would launch it off of the back of a
newsletter and I would literally go
boots on the ground knock doors meet
with local businesses okay yeah yeah
right and acquire customers that way
this is where I need your help I would
have a Le idea I would knock on the door
and be like hey so and so I have this
new AI automation agency and I'm doing
this for free for everybody and it could
be like helping to show you how to write
your first contract or like Ju Just
anything to show your value for free and
then you get them onto your newsletter
and it does two things number one it
creates a newsletter and you have an
audience and so maybe at some point
you're adding ad Revenue to that by
selling ads to local
uh people who want to advertis but then

[17:01]
uh people who want to advertis but then
the second piece is then you're
capturing also the Project based Revenue
when they're like oh I'm ready to AI
automate something in my business they
call you and they bring you in and it's
local you don't have to worry about like
Outsourcing and and being remote you're
just there in your local town does that
make sense dude Nick I I just can't I
can't right now I just can't right now
okay that's an amazing idea your idea
stands on its own it's very good but
okay no but I'm going to level it up
okay okay I'm I'm going to make it more
relevant to us to me and you and Brandon
and what we're doing right now all right
if you are watching this clip right now
you are watching this on YouTube and if
you are a fan of podcast please check
out my podcast while you're at it
because sometimes I have podcasts that
aren't on YouTube and sometimes I have
YouTubes that aren't on podcast so check
out the ker office on any podcast
platform or you can go to TKO pod.com
also my newsletter we'll throw that in
there there are no ads It's weekly it's

[18:00]
there there are no ads It's weekly it's
different content than my podcast and
YouTube newsletter. chrisj cerner.com
You'll see the link and we'll see you
there and I will say there was a YouTube
commenter recently that was like I just
love this because it's like you guys are
just it's unscripted you're just saying
this on the Fly you're actually doing
things on the fly in real time and I'm
like yeah that's what we're doing you're
freaking awesome yeah someone tell our
wives please my gosh her name is our
wives have the same name can someone
please tell them that we're tight all
right I'm not going there okay so
absolutely it's an AI newsletter
everyone's doing that big deal but who
doesn't know about AI that much local
business owners home service business
owners okay yeah and so it's an AI
newsletter that is not going to monetize
by ads it's vertically integrated it's
going to monetize by charging $1 to
$3,000 a month for zapier integration AI
integration open AI API integration all
of that stuff that's very transformative
totally with you agreed stands on its

[19:00]
totally with you agreed stands on its
own but why do we need let's say we have
a hundred different markets over the
world 100 different people starting this
local AI newsletter the content is all
the same it's the same it's about new AI
happenings and you can plug in things
here and there about XY or Z City to
make it seem more personalized but it's
really all the same content so why not
like a wh labeled or a syndication of
some sort of one parent entity writing
and creating all this content and then
sending it out to these hundred local
newsletter owners and they're just
sending it out they don't they don't do
anything they're finding subscribers
that are local to them they're using our
content or someone's parent content
sending it out no one knows that it's
duplicate because it's in an inbox it's
not on there's no SEO it's not publicly
published and then they do the same
thing they have to be there they need to
interface with the customer and so for
what we're doing with repeat leads this
could absolutely be a lead gen source

[20:01]
could absolutely be a lead gen source
for the people that are white labeling
repeat leads for us yeah to catch people
up to speed we were launching something
in
January where we do all of the backend
fulfillment so lead generation in
particular but we're working with
individuals who are you know Hustlers
side Hustlers trying to launch their
business to go out and find customers
and then they wh label the services to
us so what Chris is saying is
essentially yeah this would be an
amazing funnel for what we're doing with
repeat leads they could go out they
could find the customers and we provide
the content we provide the information
and the training and then we also
provide the Fulfillment on the back end
is is what you're describing yeah yeah
and instead of them going out and
finding customers they go out and find
newsletter subscribers that they convert
to customers with the content that we
give them for free I honestly hadn't
thought of that that is very and hear
and then talking about this right now
I'm like this is actually pretty genius
that we that we brought this up I wish I
would have said that I I actually
thought of doing like that
I'm gonna add one thing to this the way

[21:01]
I'm gonna add one thing to this the way
that I would get into it is I would pick
a niche or a very very small geography
so I would either pick like CPAs and I
would really learn their business so
that I could make custom automations for
them because that's that's where the
rubber meets the road right is like sure
I could tell you that there's a Zer
automation or that that there's a make
automation but how does that help the
CPA like which part of their workflow
does that actually automate so I would
either pick a niche or I would pick a
very small geography like oh downtown
Plano I'm just going to go and hit up as
many businesses as possible because that
way you're you're limiting your surface
area you're not spreading yourself too
thin and I would go really deep build
relationships with those people get them
to join the newsletter and like again to
your point partner with somebody who's
already creating the content you don't
have to reinvent the wheel you could
Outsource all of the Fulfillment you're
essentially a lead gen agency except
you're you're back into analog right
like it's you're not just a digital Leen

[22:01]
like it's you're not just a digital Leen
agency who's sending all these emails
like you're going in knocking doors
which has kind of become a a lost art
like people aren't knocking doors
anymore they're all trying to get it
through SEO payperclick and Google ads
and all these other things yeah and it
it's funny because we're in a we're in a
Twitter bubble with regards to AI but
we're also in a bubble with regards to
newsletters I've started getting a bunch
of newsletter subscribers from Facebook
specifically and I've had a few people
tell me this is the only newsletter I'm
on I I didn't even know what a
newsletter was oh wow this is cool this
is oh this is a newsletter I'm like
Grandma I mean who subscribes to Jesse
my wife doesn't subscribe to any
newsletters you know she's on like Beth
Bed Bath and Beyond's mailing list but
like an actual newsletter as we describe
it is not really a common thing well and
you like think about it if if I'm a
business owner I own a iPhone repair
shop and somebody comes into my store
and is like hey man I started this
business we do AI automation can I just
show you thing that we do for free and

[23:00]
show you thing that we do for free and
then at the end of that even if I don't
have something right then and they're
like do you want to be on my email list
like I just send weekly updates that
kind of show you the new things that are
coming out of course I would sign up
like legitimately I would sign up
because I'm like I might not use this
today but I'd like to kind of just keep
in the loop of what's going on because I
just don't know what's going to happen I
think you would capture emails at a much
higher rate and you would have a much
higher intent customer you and I have
talked about this you have how many
total subscribers do you have to your
newsletter
41,000 is that including the people that
that that you okay so Chris Chris has
probably close to 60,000 newsletter
subscribers but a big segment of those
newsletter subscribers were like
co-registration this is thing called
co-ed where essentially if you sign up
for one thing you you also get signed up
for a newsletter those are really
lowquality newsletter subscribers those
co-ed subscribers like they churn at a
really high rate but the people who are
not lowquality those are the ones who
went out of their way to opt in so

[24:00]
went out of their way to opt in so
you're not just like building a
newsletter list to say that you have
20,000 subscribers You're Building high
quality subscribers that are actually
going to be valuable to either your
business or to uh advertisers that want
to advertise to these individuals yeah
you're going to find a direct
correlation between how hyper Niche a
newsletter is and the open rates and
click rates I'm thinking of the
neighborhood I lived in in Houston Cross
Creek Ranch 6,000 homes therefore 6,000
homeowners 19 20,000 people in it's this
one neighborhood like a proper
neighborhood why isn't there a
newsletter there now I was getting
emails from the HOA about like the pool
is closed and whatever but that's not a
newsletter right like happenings like I
live in in this small City there's 6,000
people I get a physical magazine every
month where they profile a family that
lives here and then there's a whole
article about them and they they
monetize via ads like print ads in a
freaking magazine it's a digital version
before a year ago I would have been
sitting at home and somebody who's
listening to this might be thinking the
same thing sitting at home and being

[25:00]
same thing sitting at home and being
like well I'm a part of the Facebook
group or next door I'm on next door I
get updates from them on that there is
something dramatically different about
getting updates on a social media
platform and getting an email to your
inbox it's much more intimate to get an
email to your inbox than it is to see an
update on Facebook number one and then
number two Facebook Google Instagram
Twitter they can change the algorithm at
any time and so you may not even see the
notification you may not even see the
update you don't necessarily own the
relationship with that person if you
went and created a Twitter account or a
Facebook account to communicate to these
people the only way you can you have
that direct communication is either
through a phone number a text or an
email and so capturing their emails is
incredibly valuable that's why email
newsletters right now it may seem old
school they're growing like crazy
because the value of having a direct
onetoone relationship with your customer
far exceeds the value of building
500,000 sub subscribers on your Facebook
page back to that neighborhood I lived

[26:01]
page back to that neighborhood I lived
in 6,000 homeowners 10% of Americans are
business owners there's six 600 business
owners in that one neighborhood this is
a$1 to $3,000 a month service like that
could be a big business just localized
to that one neighborhood doing that's
I'm saying like if you you either Niche
down to a geography or to like a
business type right like Home Services
CPA whatever and I'm not saying Niche
down to a geography like oh I'll Niche
down to Boise that's dude that's that's
to big you can't cover allise it's got
to be like you're saying 6,000 homes is
still probably 25,000 people is like
that's probably the max of where you
should Niche down to if you're GNA be if
you're going to be the everything to
everybody type of guy I would I would
Niche down there specifically if you're
trying to launch a business off of it if
you're just trying to be a newsletter
and and then you're going to sell ads
down the road yeah you got to go broader
but if you if you're like I got this
business idea I'm going to Niche down in
this geography I would start that small
so that's my local AI guy newsletter

[27:00]
so that's my local AI guy newsletter
idea I love it well let me take that and
give you another customer acquisition
channel for a newsletter for a current
newsletter or a future newsletter I
tweeted about this but I didn't share
much detail so there's this one app uh
called group boss and group boss will
sync with your Facebook group and enable
you to collect emails from new group
entrance in your Facebook group so if if
you are the owner or the moderator of a
Facebook group you can set what
questions people have to answer when
they join okay Facebook does not want
you to collect emails they don't want to
be any part of that but you can ask a
question this says what is your email
address and then a thirdparty app will
take that email address put it in a
Google sheet which you can use with
zapier to put in beehive or substack or
anywhere you want so idea number one do
what I did I started an RV park off
market Facebook group six months ago I
didn't push it it had zero members and
in Faceook Facebook just started pushing
people into it today it has 2,000 people

[28:01]
people into it today it has 2,000 people
and I have the email addresses for about
1100 of them because they gave it to me
they didn't have to it wasn't a required
field okay so 1100 like arguably real
estate investor email addresses for
0 and I didn't push it I didn't push ads
I didn't push it to my community I just
started it and the algorithm's like okay
yeah people are searching for this here
you go Chris all right okay so you can
start one but that's you know we're
impatient here so we just don't want to
wait for people to to come you can buy
one you can buy a Facebook group they're
very cheap because most are not
monetized and it's worth you know if you
say hey give me I'll give you a thousand
bucks for your Facebook group I would
say most Facebook group owners or
moderators would say yes to that oh my
gosh now I'm getting so excited I know
because it's in any Niche you could ever
imagine it's hyper local it's to any
Niche any country whatever you want and
then those like those are getting people
every day so you buy the group you can
do a few things to try to get emails
from people that are already in the

[29:00]
from people that are already in the
group but it won't be very successful
you just change the questions on day one
and start collecting emails for new
entrance dude I absolutely love this
idea I absolutely love like this isn't
an idea that someone would need to sit
on their hands for six months to
implement like kind of my AI automation
idea in my mind if I were to launch it
it take some time it's like okay I got
to pick the niche I got to make sure I
understand what some of these tools I
got to go knock doors whatever I could
buy a Facebook group in the next week
the other thing is to level up your idea
you're saying to just collect emails you
could have a campaign to go back and
collect emails as well I'm doing that
with my Twitter followers right now I'm
going back to anybody who followed me
and just like hey I have this newsletter
I'd love for you to subscribe and it's
definitely not going to be as high of an
op- in rate as upfront but it still
works I think you could turn this into a
service and not even buy Facebook groups
just reach out to big Facebook groups
and say hey right now email addresses in

[30:02]
and say hey right now email addresses in
order to acquire an email address costs
on average
$2 you have a 100,000 subscribers that
if you had all their emails that would
be worth $200,000 to somebody I can help
you implement a process to not to not
only collect the emails of people who
you currently have in your group but any
new members who join from here on out
can I implement it for you for 500
bucks or or
can I implement it for you for Z and
I'll pay you 10 cents for every email
that you push to me that's if you have
an idea of what to do with the emails
right right right yeah yeah yeah but I'm
just saying like if you didn't have an
idea of what to do with the emails you
could just here's a service for me
helping you create an automation that
collects the emails because the emails
are so freaking Val that's a great idea
yeah the cavey out there is they need to
have a valuable way of using the emails
as well that might not be the case
depending on what type of group it is
you know what I'm saying yeah Fair Point
yeah so may maybe instead you you sit
and you're like all right what are what

[31:00]
and you're like all right what are what
are the five most valuable niches that I
could go after so there would be some
research maybe involved and you're like
I'll pay you 10 cents for every email
that signs up that that would be and
that would be brilliant because then the
the owner of the group is like cool am I
make an extra hundred bucks a month
great if I were like a mortgage broker
right mortgage leads are super expensive
hundreds of dollars okay there are
thousands of real estate investing
Facebook groups
thousands right in one Market Plano
Texas you're going to find 20 and then
if you go one Niche say you know Self
Storage Class B industrial you're going
to find hundreds so then when you
multiply all those together probably
tens of thousands of Facebook groups for
Real Estate Investors some of those
group owners are are probably monetizing
in some way many are not if I'm a
mortgage broker I'm going to go to the
owners like you said and say hey I'll
give you 10 cents for everyone every
email and we'll both track it in the
same Google sheet you don't have to keep
me honest and then when I get an email

[32:00]
me honest and then when I get an email
I'll just have a welcome email that says
hey my name's John I do loans I I see
you're a real estate investor would love
to help you any which way people like
John people like that mortgage broker
are paying like 50 to $300 for those
leads you could get them for 10 20 30
cents I would look at anybody any
business that currently joins Facebook
groups and then just comments asking for
business and turn that into something
that goes even farther Upstream like
you're just saying local business group
of Plano Texas right there's going to be
a guy in there who's like hey I'm the
local CPA anybody needs CPA work hey I'm
the local insurance broker do you need
insurance hey I'm the local payroll
automation person whatever do you need X
Y and Z cool that's great they join the
group for free and and they're just
commenting and everybody rolls their
eyes at them or if you're the local
insurance guy you go to the Facebook
group owner and you're like I'll pay you
10 let me implement this automation I'll
pay you 10 cents for every email that
comes in and now you don't have to rely
on the merch mercy of somebody looking
at your post and seeing you say you

[33:01]
at your post and seeing you say you
offer those
Services you can just reach out to them
there probably are some implications you
know this better than me like you
probably just can't email someone unless
they've opted in I I don't I don't know
exactly how that would work in capturing
the emails but that's where my mind
would go like go Upstream if you have a
business that already provides value by
going in Facebook groups I mean freaking
Dan magazu that's his whole business he
goes into Facebook groups comments What
If instead he went to the Facebook group
owner and was like Hey I was going to
join and comment so I could drive
business but instead I'll just pay you
10 cents per
email right and it's like oh okay cool
I'll make money and I don't have the
annoying spam in my comments great yeah
and what's great about this idea is
there's a huge Spectrum on how high
quality or low quality these groups are
some groups have no moderation and it's
just Spam and there's no engagement but
you could see that before you buy it or
before you reach out to the moderator to
cut a deal and some of them are very

[34:00]
cut a deal and some of them are very
tightly moderated and tightly curated
therefore every Post in that group gets
a lot of comments a lot of Engagement
like you can do all that filtering
yourself so you don't just have to
scatter shot reach out to everyone so
okay if you're not a mortgage broker and
listening to this which I would imagine
is 99.4% of you here's exactly how you
could make money with this there a hook
that's a that's a hook right that's a
hook it's a good hook here's what you do
you go to lendingtree.com you type in
info I want mortgage info you are going
to find exactly The Lending officers and
mortgage
brokers that are paying way too much
money for leads okay now you know who
your buyers are you already know you
don't have to just randomly Le reach out
to mortgage brokers then you circumvent
lendingtree.com because it's going to
show the name of the the broker you go
find the guy in LinkedIn and say hey
you're on Lending Tree you're probably
giving them thousands of dollars a month
with mixed results here's what I do I'm
a middleman I partner with people like
you and Facebook group moderators that
are not currently collecting email

[35:00]
are not currently collecting email
addresses you tell them exactly what
you're doing and I use software I use
proprietary processes to acquire email
addresses of Real Estate Investors okay
just say just say AI that's it that's it
I use a machine learning and augmented
reality and crypto and nfts web three
have you heard of web three no but look
at it this way you you go to the
moderator of the good group you say I'm
going to give you 5050 cents per email
you don't have to do anything okay cool
then you go to this guy and you say hey
$5 per email will you buy him yeah I'm
paying $30 per email absolutely and
you're just middleman and you only start
buying them once you've already sold
them to someone you just swipe the card
every time there's a new row created in
your Google sheet okay you know the
answer to this question I don't know the
answer if I'm capturing all those emails
from the Facebook group like if I go to
lendingtree.com I am clicking yes you
can contact me and then those those
Brokers contact me if I'm signing up for

[36:00]
Brokers contact me if I'm signing up for
the Facebook group and then there's an
automation that asks me for my email and
then I give it yes or no am I allowed to
then just cold contact
them listen Nick there are some podcasts
that don't do public math this podcast
doesn't do public talking about
regulations and can spam acts that's not
for us to figure out
okay you can do it the right way you
would just have to put in the question
when you ask it like Hey I'm
I will email you once a week with you'll
just have to put that in there and also
if someone does want to use this app
that enables this please use my
affiliate Link in the show notes because
you'll get a discount thank you what's
the app Group boss okay here's my next
question do Facebook groups so like a
newsletter if I have 10,000 subscribers
and I'm sending out a Weekly Newsletter
I can get advertisers that pay me for
access to those subscribers do Facebook
groups have advertisers pay them for
access to their Facebook groups it
happens but it's not like a common thing

[37:00]
happens but it's not like a common thing
what does it usually look like is it
just a post mhm like I I've seen guys on
Twitter that have like travel Facebook
groups like I think I I met a guy once
that had like a Hawaii tourist Facebook
group with like 150,000 people in it and
he would charge like 500 to ,000 dollar
for like a local tour guide to post in
there and then they would pin it for
like a few days so there's kind of like
a a black market for that stuff but it's
not really regulated by Facebook
that actually might be a really cool way
to do it is you go to them and you're
like hey look you've got 50,000 members
in your Facebook group right yeah yeah
what's engagement like on any given post
oh I don't know a thousand people see it
they could show screenshots right It's
let's just say people right 150th of
your whole audience sees any given post
so it's like here's what you should do
to make sure that your your Facebook
group stays in the no you need to have a
Weekly Newsletter that just updates them
on like the top three posts of the week

[38:00]
on like the top three posts of the week
hey just so you're in the in the loop in
case in case you missed it that's all
it's called in case you missed it
business owners and and it just shows
you the top three posts you collect
their emails up front that's what you
tell them it's for and then you sell
advertising through the newsletter now
if I again if I'm the mortgage broker
that's a really really easy way to get
in there and be like hey look I'll make
you the newsletter it's easy I'll set
you up on beehive I'll create the
automations all I want is for your first
six months to have a free advertisement
that's it mhm right and like and then
and then you don't have to worry about
the like optin opt whatever piece
because they're opting into the Facebook
group and and their updates as opposed
to you as the mortgage broker just
contacting them and buying the lead
because I would get kind of pissed if I
was in that Facebook group and I and I
just got co- contacted by a freaking
mortgage broker I'm like I didn't give
what no I gave the group my email I
didn't give this mortgage broker my
email you have so much you want to say
right now I love you're just like no I
don't I don't it's good

[39:02]
don't I don't it's good
there's that's a lot of dopamine all
right what you think please share it
with a friend and we'll see you next
time on the ker office
