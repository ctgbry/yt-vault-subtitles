there are 957 tree trimming companies in
Dallas Texas and I own one of them we
own one truck zero equipment zero
Warehouse Zero employees just me and my
operating partner and then we sub out
all the work it's a good business mid
six figures in Revenue 20 25% net
profits per year we are great at finding
and partnering with subcontractors but
I'm really tempted to do a 180 and
become a subcontractor and only do stump
grinding here's why stump grinding is a
pain it's a loss leader no one likes it
that tree triming businesses don't like
to own a sump grinder because they don't
use them every day then they have to go
rent one and it's a waste of time and
money so what we want to do is we want
to build a referral partnership with
hundreds of tree trimming and landscape
companies in Dallas and we want to do
only stump grinding much like the patch
boys only do uh drywall patch repair and
it's a billion- dooll franchise Network
we're going to build an army of these
referral partners and build a big
business what do you think should I try
it or is this a dumb idea follow me to
see how it goes
