[00:00]
This might look like a curb. That's not
a curb. That concrete is supposed to be
level. But what you're looking at is a
$9,000 job with 40% profit margins ran
into the industry. In the first 6
months, you expect to do $100,000 of
profit.
&gt;&gt; We are just shy of $20,000. Not just
that, but you can make eight Sorry, it
needs to be leveled. You can make $800
per job.
&gt;&gt; Babe, this is too easy. I'm doing
something wrong.
&gt;&gt; Don't quit your job. No employees.
subcontract out all the work and have a
$10,000 a month cash flowing business.
We're talking about concrete leveling
today, guys. I'm meeting with Jeff. He's
doing exactly that. He has a W2. He has
a wife and two kids. And he has a
business that pays him very handsomely.
So, we're going to ask him exactly how
do you do it? How do you find customers?
How do you fulfill the service? How do
you talk about this stuff when you don't
even kind of know what you're talking
about? Well, let's dive in. Right. So,
how long ago did you start this
business?
&gt;&gt; I'm a newbie. I've been doing this for a
solid 90 days so far.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Beautiful.
&gt;&gt; Basically an expert.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. What has your total revenue been
so far?
&gt;&gt; We are just shy of $20,000 and majority
of that has come in the past 60 days.

[01:01]
of that has come in the past 60 days.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Wow.
&gt;&gt; And how much of that is profit, give or
take?
&gt;&gt; We're seeing anywhere from 30 to 40%
gross margin on each job.
&gt;&gt; What do you think your net profit will
end up being once you're more at scale?
&gt;&gt; We'll try to continue scaling. My goal
this year is to finish 250,000 topline
revenue before the end of the year. And
if we can do $50 to $100,000 gross
dollars as margin, then that would be an
outstanding success. Plan for next year
is 1 million topline revenue. Anywhere
from 20 to 40% margin, I'd be extremely
happy with.
&gt;&gt; Wow. So, you're saying brand new to the
industry. You didn't work in this
industry before. In the first 6 months,
you expect to do 100,000 of profit.
&gt;&gt; I hope too.
&gt;&gt; And you're on track.
&gt;&gt; We need to win a couple bigger jobs, but
we've seen some really good
encouragement right out of the gate. And
so the market is relatively saturated in
the sense that there's a lot of
providers, but we have found a good way
to differentiate ourselves relative to a
lot of the noise. And so my peers are
typically solopreneurs who own their own
trailer, work for themselves, and once
they hit a certain threshold of either

[02:00]
they hit a certain threshold of either
revenue or margin, they just like to
coast. Nothing's wrong with that at all.
Everything after that is just gravy for
them. What I want to do is create a
process that is repeatable and can be
copy and pasted across mid-tier, smaller
tier markets, across the Texas coast and
and along the border of Mexico in order
to own markets where there is no
providers currently operating. So
Houston has, you know, a couple million
people living there. I want to target
Port Brownsville, Corpus Christi, etc.
where there's no established providers,
population of 200 to 300,000 people and
little to no competition. you kind of go
find the solo provider who reached
$200,000 in revenue and he's cool and
you come in there and say, "Hey, I can
get you to the next level without you
having to do any additional work." So,
any additional jobs you want above that
revenue mark. I'll send your way. I'm
going to work in my margin and we can
work together. Correct. Okay. Do you
have a harder time finding good
subcontractors or customers?
&gt;&gt; It's been a huge blessing. been so
fortunate to work with the people that I
have and I am lucky on finding those
folks and everybody I've worked with so

[03:00]
folks and everybody I've worked with so
far has been honest and straightforward
and I look for some common denominators.
HMI who's the manufacturer of these
trailers typically and the main producer
of the raw materials that we looked at
earlier have a soft spot in their heart
for veterans and so typically you see a
lot of veterans that are owning their
own trailers that I found are are so
easy to work with.
&gt;&gt; What about customer acquisition? How has
that gone so far?
&gt;&gt; We have a number of channels open. I
sold my first job June 2025 and it was a
lead that I found through a Facebook
lead. My cost per lead was, you know,
$4.60 or something. And I found that
lead within an hour or two of the
campaign being approved and launched.
&gt;&gt; Now, this is a Facebook ad campaign, not
marketplace or groups.
&gt;&gt; Facebook ad campaign. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, within 2 hours of launch, you had
your first $5 lead, which turned into
your first customer,
&gt;&gt; correct? So, you're like $2,500 of
revenue.
&gt;&gt; This is so easy.
&gt;&gt; I looked at my wife00 of revenue.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I was like, "Babe, this is too
easy. I'm doing something wrong. What is
going on?" But obviously, there's some
lessons learned along the way. You know,
didn't make any margin on that job

[04:00]
didn't make any margin on that job
because it was an hour outside of town
and I needed to factor in the team's
time of driving to the job into the
overall cost.
&gt;&gt; So, Facebook ads, has that been like the
the daily driver for your customer
acquisition?
&gt;&gt; I turn those on and off. We've seen Next
Door work well. Next door ads or organic
stuff?
&gt;&gt; Next door organic. Google search
organic. We've had folks refer us. We've
had inbound leads just on the website
and through our chat bots asking about
inquiries. And then I've taken a page
out of your own playbook and done some
outbound texting campaigns to think HOA
managers, property managers, etc. that
are overseeing multiple properties. And
so by staying in front of them, that's
generated a slow trickle of volume as
well.
&gt;&gt; And a lot of times you have to like play
the long game on that and it's a little
depressing for the first month, but then
they start to come back, especially as
you follow up, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So what we're looking at here, Chris,
it's really cool. We just completed
leveling this singular slab. As you see,
the hole is about the size of a dime.
So, if the concrete is not stained, the
sealant that you use to fill everything

[05:01]
sealant that you use to fill everything
with is non- noticeable. But for stained
items, you can kind of see it a little
bit. The cool thing here is that 15
minutes after the work has been done,
you're ready for a car to drive over
this thing without any sort of influence
&gt;&gt; on the integrity of the lifting that was
just completed.
&gt;&gt; How many inches deep did that drill go?
So there's depending on the job, it
depends on how deep it'll go. And so if
you drill until you hit the bottom of
the cavity that you're trying to fill.
And so typically on sidewalks that's no
more than 24 in. There's obviously
exceptions that can be applied. The
largest I've ever seen is about 7 or 8
ft or a whole river formed underneath a
driveway. And so a job that they thought
was going to be, you know, $1,500 of
cost ended up being $5,000 of cost.
&gt;&gt; A river underneath a driveway. or where
there was a cracked sewer and it was
just flowing water downhill and so
additional complications because it was
on an incline which made things less
straightforward.
&gt;&gt; How do you know when you're to the void?
&gt;&gt; You can feel it. We'll get you to do it
in time but you can push it down and

[06:01]
in time but you can push it down and
once you hit the the bottom of it you
get resistance. Okay.
&gt;&gt; But when you go through the concrete you
assuming you get it right then you have
the pressure breaks immediately after
you break through the concrete and then
you can push through. And so if you are
dealing with a longer or a deeper
vacuum, there are opportunities to
create longer distribution straws, if
you will, to achieve the goal. But for
these, plug it in right into the cap,
which sits between the hole and the gun.
And then you saw you tighten it on at
the end of the gun. And then that acts
as the primary location where the
chemistry takes place and the foams
collide.
&gt;&gt; What do your revenues and costs look on
a job like this about this size?
&gt;&gt; On a single job, the cost will start
there. We're talking just a few hundred.
The revenues depend on what you want to
set your minimum project at. And so the
scope for this is a little bit bigger.
But if we look at this, if this were
just a standalone job,
&gt;&gt; it's a standalone job. I mean, you can
make money charging $600 to $1,000 on
this right here.
&gt;&gt; If you own everything vertically, if I'm

[07:00]
&gt;&gt; If you own everything vertically, if I'm
subbing it out, I'm going to probably
pay $600, $700, and I'd look to charge
at least $1,000 for something this
small. The market has been growing
incredibly, especially on the
residential focus and the anability to
distinguish yourself among peers within
the market, at least in Houston and and
likely in Dallas Fort Worth area as
well, is that you can stack up a lot of
small jobs on top of each other. And if
you can provide quick value to those
homeowners and you can align and
triangulate multiple jobs within the
same area, neighborhood, region, etc.,
then you can have a nice profitable day.
But rolling a truck just to do this type
of job after you look at fuel,
windshield time, etc. It just strains
your margin a little bit.
&gt;&gt; In your case, you're subbing out jobs
like this, you try to quote 1,100, pay
the sub 600, and you're done. If you own
all the equipment, you're probably going
to charge 700 or so, and make half of
that as profit. So, when you're subbing
it out, you make the same amount of
gross profit, but you do less work. The
trade-off being you'll probably close

[08:00]
trade-off being you'll probably close
less jobs cuz you you're kind of forced
to be a little more expensive.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And so we pride ourselves on two
things. We guarantee that we'll provide
a quality product and we will provide
you with excellent communication. I
don't try to get into any bidding wars.
Those customers typically be more of a
pain in the butt longer over time. But
if you're honest and straightforward
with folks upfront about the two things
that you're really good at us, we
deliver quality work and we can have
extraordinary communication with you
along the way. And most folks appreciate
that if they're just trying to buy back
time or, you know, outsource an issue or
problem at their home or along their
sidewalk, etc.
Listen, I know you're here to learn how
to get more customers for this business,
and we're going to get there. I promise.
Just be patient.
&gt;&gt; There's a few key components every time
you want to level concrete. There's a
generator which is going to power this
whole trailer. There's an air compressor
which helps push all the materials
through. We have two raw materials A and

[09:01]
through. We have two raw materials A and
B which create the chemistry reaction
which solidifies the foam. There's the
reactor which warms up the materials to
the ideal heat and then the reactor
pushes the materials pulls the materials
through the hose which is connected to
our gun. Right here at the very tip of
the gun is where the chemical reaction
takes place where A hits B plus air
which pushes into the void within the
hole in the sidewalk or driveway or
parking lot. So you said about 103 for
one, 110 for another. They come down the
hose. You could warm the hose for cooler
climates, right? This hose is warmed.
Yeah, you can turn it on or off.
&gt;&gt; And then it all kind of comes together
at the end right at the nozzle where the
air pushes it all through. Combines the
two materials. Chemical reaction
happens. Foam comes under the concrete
and expands and lifts it all up
&gt;&gt; and lifts it up. Good as new. A third of
the cost of new concrete by design
supposed to be pretty easy so that
somebody even like myself can't mess it
up.
&gt;&gt; How do you quote jobs if you don't know
how big the void is? So there are some,
you know, maths you can do based on the

[10:02]
you know, maths you can do based on the
size of the differential, but you get
upside down on a job if you don't
estimate enough foam. You know, the
quickest way to lose your tail on a job
is by undercalculating those forecasts.
And so personally, I built in a a very
conservative approach on how much foam
we need to deal. And so sometimes you
don't know until you get out there. But
t you do a thousand sidewalks, you do a
thousand driveways, there's only so many
holes that can reappear, right? So, the
good news here is that we're not solving
cancer. We're not rocket scientists by
any means, but you get enough reps in
and you can anticipate based on
surrounding items such as trees, maybe
there's water lines, maybe there's
sprinkler systems that are leaking, etc.
And so, if you ask enough educated
questions and you observe the
immediately surrounding perimeter, then
you can get within a pretty good
estimate.
&gt;&gt; Now, if someone were to not want to sub
out all the work, do it themselves, what
would a whole setup like this cost? So,
this trailer, I think this is a 20ft
trailer. You will start about at
$120,000
turnkey. And then your raw materials,

[11:01]
turnkey. And then your raw materials,
depending on the count of jobs that you
do on a a weekly or monthly basis, will
be about 2 to three grand. That's $2 per
pound for each of these 55gallon drums.
And so, that's your throughput. Your
biggest risk is your gun breaking. The
gun is probably the most expensive
product by weight within the whole
concrete leveling deal. A nicer gun will
cost you about $5,000. And so, as
mentioned before, you don't want to let
that clog up and you want to make sure
that's clear so that you can continue to
work. Without the gun, you can't do any
&gt;&gt; So, a whole 55gallon drum of materials
is like a couple thousand.
&gt;&gt; Okay, Chris, this is really exciting.
We're going to have you drill a hole
here. So, it's a powerful drill. You
already signed your liability waiver, so
thank you for doing that. But, we will
have you just turn it on. You push it
down.
&gt;&gt; So in your finance meetings when they
say, "Let's drill down on this." This is
what they're talking.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. This is what they say in Texas.
Drill, baby, drill.
&gt;&gt; This is like a smaller version of it.
Your right hand, you have your trigger
here, and you want to support it with

[12:01]
here, and you want to support it with
your left hand. And you just go for it.
Oh, yeah. There you go. Yeah. Sweep it
up. We like to leave every place cleaner
than the way we found it.
&gt;&gt; All right. So, you go black side down.
And you just want to hammer it in. And
then the the gun we showed you earlier
will connect to this. These are
single-use items, so you run through
them based on the size of your job and
the counter holes. So those are
discarded afterwards.
&gt;&gt; What are these cost you?
&gt;&gt; Quarters or less. Yeah, you buy them by
the 100. Man, I'm so proud of you. Great
job. So we have it in neutral right now.
This is not turned on. The air is not
coming through. You pull it all the way
up. That turns the air valve on and
pushes air through. You want to go from
air on to injecting the foam. What we're
going to do here, keep it in neutral.
We're going to turn it on. And then
we're going to shift it all the way down
to 6:00. Let it go for 2 seconds. And
then we're going to pull it back up to
neutral a bit of an angle and keep the
air coming through at all times.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, it's coming right back up to
the top when I'm done.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, the last thing we want to do
is let the gun clog. That's a a big

[13:00]
is let the gun clog. That's a a big
problem. Whenever you're ready, man.
&gt;&gt; All right. Let's freaking do it.
&gt;&gt; One, two. That's it. You did it.
&gt;&gt; How do you know when you're done
&gt;&gt; now? Yeah. Now, we're going to watch.
&gt;&gt; Do you always only want to do it for two
counts at a time?
&gt;&gt; No. It depends on what you're working
on. Right now, we're working on a small
lift. We're not trying to get too much
foam in. And you can see the needle will
start moving. It takes about 15 seconds
for the foam to start reacting. Once it
starts reacting, you'll start seeing
that needle start moving. Now,
underneath it here, we know we have a
big void. So, we're filling the void
before and pushing ground away and
letting the foam rise. Once we've filled
that void, and once that area is full,
the foam will start pushing up.
&gt;&gt; So, what are you looking for the gauge
to do exactly? It
&gt;&gt; It'll start spinning to the right as the
concrete's going up. For something this
small, we want it to move slow so we
don't overload. How much effort or time
did you put into your website or your
Google business profile?
&gt;&gt; I didn't spend too much time. I invested
zero dollars. I built it all in replet.
And so my goal is to just have easy
clean landing page. As I've started
seeing a little bit more volume come
through, then I've been playing with the
idea of having a professional build out

[14:01]
idea of having a professional build out
the website. But right now it captures
95% of people that are coming to my
website if they actually are interested.
Whether it's through forms, chat bots,
or other items that I've set up. Yeah.
So I try to differentiate in a few ways.
I mentioned the quality of our services
and the communication. And another thing
I do for residential jobs is I throw in
a free power wash on the area. And so I
have it structurally written in a way
that, hey, you level your driveway with
us, we'll power wash your driveway for
free. My cost for that is typically $100
or $150 and it covers the entire
property. And so that comes 2 3 days
after the leveling is done. And so then
I text the owner, especially if they've
had a good experience. I say, "Hey, our
power washing guy is going to be there
to do the driveway." I told him to throw
in your sidewalks as well for free.
While he's there, if you want him to do,
you know, your backyard, that'd only be
$100. So, it's a small upsell to
potentially cover the cost. It's already
baked into what my topline quote is.
&gt;&gt; So, you just sub that out and eat the
cost. You basically work it into the
quote and then find another pressure
washing company to do that.

[15:00]
washing company to do that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I want people to see effort and
joy in every job that we're doing. And a
way that we can very easily deliver on
that is by leaving something cleaner
than the way that we found it. And
there's a bunch of power washing folks
that will do it for less than $100. If
you're liking this video, which I know
you are, I mean, come on, just go ahead
and hit subscribe real quickly. It would
mean the world to me. Of all the things
you could have started, of all the
opportunities you saw out there, why did
you pick this one? So, one thing that
excites me about what we're doing is
that if concrete were a crop, then
Houston would be the largest farm in
North America. If concrete were a
standalone entity or country, it would
be the third highest carbon emitter
globally. Texas alone accounts for
roughly 20% of new concrete being poured
in the United States and the two leading
markets are Houston and DFW. And so in
an effort to not recreate the wheel,
choose a service or a line of work that
has already been validated for
centuries. That was something that I
wanted to bring a new and fresh look to.
&gt;&gt; Well, in Houston and Dallas, we're not
geographically constrained. We grow out,

[16:01]
geographically constrained. We grow out,
&gt;&gt; right? Not up. They're massive sprawling
metroplexes. What what did you first see
that kind of gave you the idea to even
start to look into this industry before
you knew how big of a market it was?
&gt;&gt; I had somebody quote my house a year
prior and they quoted me $2,200 and I
was like, "Oh my gosh, $2,200 to fix 12
ft of a walkway from the street to my
house." Like, that is outrageous.
&gt;&gt; And why did you want to fix? Were you
selling it?
&gt;&gt; I'm not selling. There's about an inch
dip. There still is. I'm embarrassed to
say, but there is an instill tripping
hazard that my younger son had stubbed
his toe a couple times. And so,
typically from a residential side,
you're trying to remove tripping hazards
or a liability standpoint. There's
aesthetics or vanity. You want your
house to look good or your neighbor just
got a new driveway and you don't want to
pay 30 grand for a new driveway. So,
you'll pay three grand to level your
current driveway. And those are typical
buying levers to pull.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Let's talk about job size then.
What is your average job size with
regards to revenue?
&gt;&gt; $2,500. And what's your average profit
margin on that?
&gt;&gt; A thousand.
&gt;&gt; So 30 35 40% profit. And do you quote

[17:02]
&gt;&gt; So 30 35 40% profit. And do you quote
all the jobs yourself?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So one thing that I try to be
different about everybody I'm competing
against will roll a truck to go to look
at a job site. And there is benefit from
building relationships with your
potential buyer. But my hypothesis on
doing everything remotely and virtually
is that I can crank out five or 10
quotes. You know, the time it takes me
to drive an hour outside of town, spend
an hour with the homeowner, then drive
an hour back. And so in those 3 hours,
maybe you have a 50 or 60% chance of
winning that job. I'm okay quoting it
all virtually over the phone by
collecting enough photographs. Maybe my
win rate goes down to 25%, but if I'm
doing 10 in the same time, then I'm
winning more gross revenue over time.
&gt;&gt; What else are you doing in the industry
that's kind of progressive? Like how are
you trying to change things in this
industry?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So one thing I'm really excited
about, I'm still wrapping my head around
it, but I want to provide concrete
leveling as a service. So the go to
market is going to be commercially
focused or industrial focused to
property managers, new home builders,
maybe folks that own retail properties

[18:00]
maybe folks that own retail properties
around town, multiple retail properties
around town, and I want to be an
insurance-like product that gives them
up to a certain amount of concrete
leveling at each of their properties on
an annualized basis. Or maybe you get
one free job per property per month or
something like that. and I want to sell
it as a higher ticket item that's in the
six figures that would have to be
budgeted for on an annualized basis for
these bigger companies. But that way I
can create more predictability to my top
line and I also will have higher
utilization and justification to own
more assets. If I know that I can cover
my entire fixed cost based on just this
one contract, then that creates a lot
more upward mobility for growth. And
since real estate and and these other
folks are going to be prominent in most
cities you go to, that type of thing can
be a pathway if they own equipment in
multiple cities to expand geographies
very quickly or to easily target which
areas you want to go to next based on
relationships that you've been able to
build. I think you'd have an even better

[19:01]
build. I think you'd have an even better
easier time selling that if you really
played up the liability side of it and
if you got some industry facts talking
about trip and fall lawsuits and how
much it could cost them and it's
prevention is better than the cure etc
etc. If you play into the fear side of
it as opposed to like the aesthetic side
of it I think you could have some
success there.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. What's your saying?
&gt;&gt; Invent the disease sell the cure.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Starting a business is hard so
don't start it by yourself but also
don't give away a ton of equity to a guy
that never pulls his weight. Check out
tkowners.com. It's my personal private
community where we are starting,
building, and growing businesses all
together.
&gt;&gt; All right. So, you're a father of two.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You have a W2 job.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You have this business and other
businesses.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Is someone able to run a business like
this while doing all these other things
or are you just like a superhero freak
of nature?
&gt;&gt; I don't know about that. A lot of credit
goes to my wife. She get the wife of the
year award for sure. I've just been so
blessed to have the ability to manage my
time in a way that I need to based on
whatever is happening. And so by no by
no means is this a Jeff is incredible,
but I've just been fortunate to work
with great people, be surrounded with a

[20:00]
with great people, be surrounded with a
supporting and loving wife and have two
incredible boys that are not a a
headache, but just a a joy to be around.
So if someone wanted to make 10,000 a
month of net profit in this business,
how many hours a week ongoing? Like of
course in the beginning there's going to
be more, but over time how many hours a
week do you think that would require? My
biggest week was $10,000 topline revenue
and that took three jobs and I sold
three jobs in two days. And so that was
just a bit of luck and fortune. And then
seeing those through to fulfillment is
something that I'm not personally
involved in a whole lot. And so what I
require with my sales is that uh we
never book jobs the same week. And so
we'll take 50% down payment immediately
once the sale is done and then the
remainder is due after the job is
completed. And so I hold the subs to a
higher st not a higher standard but just
to a hey we're going to be there at 10
o'clock on Tuesday and they have to send
pictures and check-ins in order to do
that. Okay. So if your average job is
2500 you said let's say 800 of profit
per job give or take. You got to do

[21:00]
per job give or take. You got to do
about 12 jobs a month to make $10,000.
So call it three a week give or take.
What what's your close rate on quotes?
&gt;&gt; On quotes. So, in the past 30 days, I've
done four jobs. Out of my pipeline has
about 30 or 35. Of those 35, only like
12 are qualified. And so, I'd say about
a third rolling average of a 33%. Would
you consider yourself a killer salesman
or average?
&gt;&gt; I It's an area that I need to be better
at.
&gt;&gt; Well, that's good. Most people are
probably average as well. So, let's say
33% close rate. You need to do 12 jobs.
That means you need to quote 36 jobs.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Work backward.
&gt;&gt; Work back. So, you need 36 leads a month
to do $10,000 a month in net profit. And
how many hours do you think that would
take to quote? Well, let's let's we'll
call it like 10 quotes a week, give or
take.
&gt;&gt; A quote, if you're asking the right
questions, only takes an hour. And so,
from the time that the lead comes in to
qualifying it, I try to have no
downtime. So, Chris calls in. I want to
talk to Chris immediately. I want to see
what he's trying to solve. I want to
understand like what's the pain that he

[22:00]
understand like what's the pain that he
wants to get rid of and help him just
come to a decision of this is something
I might want to do or not. So, I'm
trying less to sell you and convince you
to do this. I just want to understand
the pain that you're trying to avoid.
And once you understand that pain, then
you can help that person make an
educated guess. So, it's not
unreasonable.
It's not unreasonable to say that
someone with a full-time job could run
this business, if they acquired enough
leads, call it 35, 40 leads a month, in
5 hours of quoting per week, they could
make 10,000 a month of profit.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. If you have the systems in place,
for sure.
&gt;&gt; What speaking of systems, what what is
like your tech stack? So custom software
plus my CRM is high level.
&gt;&gt; Okay. High level is your CRM. You built
your website with Replet. Any other
tools like calendar widgets or apps that
you use?
&gt;&gt; No, I do a lot of texting. I see a lot
great benefit in texting the prospects
and so high level has a good text chat
AI bot or whatever it is. You can kind
of create guard rails around it. And so
the ease of a lead coming in and then
setting up automations to reach out to
that person is pretty lowhanging fruit.

[23:01]
that person is pretty lowhanging fruit.
And it goes a long way if you get a text
right after you complete a form and then
ask if they're free to connect and then
call them regardless of what they say.
If they can't talk, they'll tell you.
&gt;&gt; What are what are your ongoing costs in
this business? And how do you manage
insurance?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so each sub has to have at least a
million dollars of insurance, one to $2
million. And then the CRM plus replet is
less than $500 a month. So I have
multiple I forget what tier it is in
high level, but you have like unlimited
sub accounts. So I pay for that one. And
Replet is probably an incremental $100
based on whatever if I'm trying to build
something. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So 500 600 bucks a month. You don't pay
for insurance cuz your subs do,
&gt;&gt; right?
&gt;&gt; Uh and that's it. And it's remote.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. If you have a good understanding
of what you're trying to fix and you can
target low complex jobs, think big
parking lot for a commercial building,
then those are six figure revenue
opportunities that require little to no
complexity. And then you just need to
plan it out. Yeah. And so one thing I'm
investing time in researching is how do
I create more efficient bids and more
attractive bids for the city of Houston
and other municipalities. But I'd see it

[24:02]
and other municipalities. But I'd see it
as a big win 5 years from now if I had
know the Texas Department of
Transportation, City of Houston and
Harris County potentially as past
customers for either one or multiple
jobs.
&gt;&gt; Do you think people should even consider
getting their own trailer and doing it
all themselves or is subbing it out just
the way to go?
&gt;&gt; Really depends on what you want. I think
over time I'd love for this to be a
full-time gig. Currently, there's no
need for me in Houston to get my own
trailer. Over time, my vision is to
expand into some of the smaller markets
in Texas where there are no competitors
or providers and that at that time it
makes sense to to buy the equipment. But
your entry cost just for a van, so you
think the van this size or half the size
of the trailer that we were in earlier
is probably about $60 to $70,000. It's
not nothing, which creates and prevents
some folks from entering into the
market, but there's a lot of opportunity
on this tale of, you know, smaller
cities relative to maybe DFW or Houston
that I'm really excited about. Well,
Jeeoff, thank you for your time today.
&gt;&gt; Thank you. This has been an absolute
treat. I've enjoyed it. Been a longtime

[25:00]
treat. I've enjoyed it. Been a longtime
follower, first time seeing you in
person. I think what you're doing is so
cool. You're inspiring to not only
myself, but other folks that were within
your network. And I want to, you know,
for whatever it's worth, tell you you're
doing a great job and really appreciate
the voice that you have in Texas and
outside of that, this great state.
&gt;&gt; Thank you for the kind words. Where
should people find you if they want to
learn more?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, website is Texaslabguys.com
and love to connect if uh you're in
Texas, if you are within the commercial
real estate world. I love to pick your
brain and figure out how we're can
better penetrate this industry. And if
you're in concrete leveling, too. I love
to just meet more folks either within
concrete or concrete leveling. It's a
relatively small world and the more
folks I can meet either in Texas or
outside, I'd love to sharpen my own
understanding of the market as well.
&gt;&gt; Or if you're on the coast of Texas or in
greater Houston, you need some concrete
leveled. Texaslabg guys.com.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Portoanzis, Brownsville, Corpus
Christi, just to name a few. If you're
just looking for names, just uh Chris,
thank you so much. I really appreciate
it, man. Absolutely.
&gt;&gt; Be good. Yep.
