so laundromats are an infinite money
glitch business if you do these three
growth hacks right I'll tell you what
they are and then I'll tell you how much
laundromats make every year number one
make laundry 100% free for the first two
weekends after opening this will get
people into the habit of coming into
your laundry mat as opposed to the one
they used to go to and you'll have
customers for life number two only open
in a location with three to five
laundromats at the same intersection you
want a dense competitive area because
these are likely zombie mats which means
they're poorly ran they're dirty and
they're undercharging and you're going
to put them out of business number three
you want to have a massive grand opening
send thousands of postcards within a 3 m
radius in the weeks leading up to it
free food live band have the mayor there
the whole shebang you can make 40% net
profit margins on a laundromat my friend
