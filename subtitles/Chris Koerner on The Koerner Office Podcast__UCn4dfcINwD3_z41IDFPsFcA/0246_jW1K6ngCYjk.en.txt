this random business in California makes
60 grand every weekend just for
providing a free parking lot for people
to buy and sell cars to each other
here's exactly what they're doing and
exactly how you can copy them so they
charge 149 bucks to 5 to 700 people
every weekend to come park a car in a
parking lot and then buyers come look at
it and they buy them directly from the
seller here's what I would do if I were
you I go to Facebook Marketplace I get a
list of all the bestselling cars and
trucks in the area and I'd message them
and say hey hey hey don't meet your
buyers in a shady alley send them all my
autoare bring your car it's 100% free
have them all arrive at the same time so
there's a bidding war and then you go to
Facebook groups and say hey we have all
these cars for sale on Saturday and
Sunday at this parking lot you want 10
times as many buyers as you have sellers
so there's much more demand than Supply
don't charge anyone and then once it
works come back the following week as
sponsors charge 149 bucks each you can
copy this anywhere
