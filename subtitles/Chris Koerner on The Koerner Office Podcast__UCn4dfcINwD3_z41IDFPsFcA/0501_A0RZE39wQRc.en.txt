[00:00]
okay after 10 days of wandering the West
Coast with my family I am ready to get
back at it and talk some business with
you guys so what you see from me today
is launching business after business and
partnering with operators and talking
about ideas but I actually launched a
business in 2013 that I ran for seven
years and that was one of the biggest
most quote sophisticated businesses I
ever had and so I want to talk exactly
about what went into starting and
running and exiting that business and
what important Frameworks I picked up
along the way that you could apply to
anything you might doing in business I
plan to be short to the point packed
with high value I don't want to be more
of verbose than I have to be so you can
get on your Merry Little
[Music]
way so I can't talk about this business
without talking about the business that
came before it because they kind of
played into each other and once again if
you've heard my every business I ever
started videos you'll hear a little
overlap here but not a lot so when it
was 2010 I was a senior at the
University of Alabama long story short I
learned about iPhone repairs as a
business and I learned about these guys

[01:00]
business and I learned about these guys
in Baton Rouge Louisiana that opened a
store called iPhone MD and they were
fixing iPhones making 20 to 30 grand a
month from one store on Airport Road in
Baton Rouge and I thought that's my
business that's the one I'm going to do
and so one of my classmates gave me a
broken iPhone for free around the same
time I saw a flyer on campus that said
I'll fix your broken iPhone I remember
he lived in the Hound Tooth apartments
on 15th Street I pulled up into the
apartments I remember exactly where he
lived I went in his apartment with my
broken iPhone he had pre pre-ordered the
part from eBay and I was just fascinated
about everything he was doing what is
this part what's it called and I wasn't
asking him these questions because I had
planned to compete with him I'm just a
business nerd I love learning this stuff
so wow what's that a section cup huh
where did you learn how to do this why
did you do this how many of these do you
fix a week do you like it is it hard Yad
Yad y i peppered him with questions by
the time I was out of his apartment I
had paid him 60 bucks I had a fixed
iPhone and I knew that I wanted to start
this business so I did and I went to the
SBD Small Business Development Center I

[02:02]
SBD Small Business Development Center I
made a formal business plan and I said I
want to start this business I want to
launch it on 15th Street coincidentally
the same street that this guy's
apartment was on I found a 2200t space
it was a 4un strip mall and it's still
there you could look it up it was 1505
15th Street and there was a Subway a
Batteries Plus and then two vacancies
and I wanted to rent the vacancy right
next to Batteries Plus it was an amazing
retail location and I was fairly
convinced that I would do well because I
had learned that in retail it comes down
to location location location so I
figured I'm not going to have to do much
marketing if I can find a good location
so there's a framework for you if you're
opening a retail business do not save
money on location period end of story
and that's coming from a lifetime Cheapo
if you want to save on location you're
going to pay more than what you saved in
marketing to get people to hear about
you there's also a McDonald's next door
and one good framework for retail is

[03:00]
and one good framework for retail is
piggyback on McDonald's research if
you're close to McDonald's it's probably
a good location so I was laughed out of
this Small Business Development Center
by this Boomer business owner that said
this is a terrible idea I needed to open
in the ghetto yada yada yada 2500 a
month or 2200 a month is way too much
and I just ignored him and he put a chip
on my shoulder and I launched and it was
slow business was slow and I'm like wow
was this guy right and I remember
sitting in my Mis management information
systems class one evening on the
computer Googling how to declare
bankruptcy how do you know if you I
didn't even have anything to declare
it's kind of like Michael Scott in the
office I declare bankruptcy that was me
I just knew that things were not going
well until I got the mayor involved Walt
Maddox and I had a grand opening with a
big red ribbon and I got the crimson and
white there the school newspaper and I
just generated some buzz and so you
could say that when I opened it was kind
of a soft opening because no one really
knew about it and then I had a grand
opening a couple months later and things

[04:01]
opening a couple months later and things
got a lot better from then on out we
opened a second store I say we it was me
and my partner Andrew we were 50-50
Partners I ended up buying him out he
moved to another state took another job
and so I ended up owning that business
entirely long story short we opened four
locations I opened four locations over
the next two years I had a Wandering eye
and one day I was Manning the store or I
got a phone call from someone that said
hey I want to buy your broken iPhone
screens and that made no sense to me and
I said well why what do you want from my
broken iPhone screens and he said well
we can recycle them in China and then we
get them shipped back and then we can
sell them as remanufactured units and it
just you know sometimes you hear an idea
and just immediately you're like that is
a good idea and it's also kind of a
skill it's kind of an art and a science
but the more you hear ideas the more
you're able to immediately recognize for
whatever reason this is a good idea and
I was able to recognize it so
immediately because I knew this business
business so intimately and I just

[05:02]
business so intimately and I just
couldn't sleep I couldn't stop thinking
about this idea so I started reaching
out to manufacturers in in China which
sounds a lot more sophisticated than it
really is I went to alibaba.com I typed
in iPhone screen I got hundreds of
results I typed out a message that said
hey I own an iPhone store also I want to
open an iPhone Parts Main supplier also
I want to start buying back and selling
broken iPhone screens can you give me
quotes for all of the above and I copy
and pasted that same message to dozens
if not hundreds of suppliers in shenzen
and guano China which is in southeast
China and those are like the two
Electronics manufacturing cities so I
sent that to tons of them a bunch of
them responded I got free samples from a
bunch of them they would send me two to
four iPhone screens and some home
buttons if you remember those earpieces
and batteries those are the big the big
four and I was supposed to see how the
quality was and I guess I knew how

[06:01]
quality was and I guess I knew how
iPhone Parts quality looked because I
had been fixing iPhone screens for two
years in my business but I didn't really
know it's like oh yeah this feels kind
of solid this didn't fall apart in my
hands this must be good so I found this
guy named David David sue for whatever
reason I liked him and we hit it off and
I had sold my business and that's
another story for another day my it was
called phone restore my iPhone parts
stores sold it to a couple guys and I
had like $20,000 in disposable income
but I still owned a third of the iPhone
Parts business or the iPhone repair
business and I was expecting it to
provide me some mailbox money but that's
another story well actually that's it's
all the same story so I'll get into that
just a little bit and so I took $177,000
and I wired it to David Sue in China and
that was one of the biggest risks I've
ever taken because David you know if he
were a short-term thinker he could have
thought hm 17 grand free and clear he'd
never find me he'd never track me down
but he didn't he was a long-term thinker
and he thought if I don't screw this guy

[07:01]
and he thought if I don't screw this guy
which he probably never even considered
it because I later learned he's a great
guy if I don't steal this guy's money
then he'll pay me millions of dollars
over the next few years and that's
exactly what I ended up doing so David
and I are friends to this day and it's
been 13 years now since I first wired
him the money this month 12 years and so
that was my first initial Parts order
because my whole thesis was let's get
our foot in the door by calling up
repair shops and offering to give them
money right it's much easier sale
of here's some money I want to buy this
from you that you were previously
throwing away versus let me take your
money and sell you Parts but then once
we had their trust then we would turn
around and sell them parts that was the
thesis and so I put a spreadsheet
together in Google Sheets I probably
still have that original one and I was
just kind of guesstimating my starting
inventory and I knew what market prices
were because I had been buying prices
man what were they called like ieep I
think it was called ieep and it was like
this ugly shop if store that sold iPhone

[08:01]
this ugly shop if store that sold iPhone
parts wholesale out of Phoenix and they
were pretty garbage their customer
service is crap and there just were not
a lot of iPhone part suppliers out there
so I knew that there was a big hole in
that market as well and it's funny
because this here's a framework like if
you're in an industry let's say you own
a house painting business you look at
that industry a th% differently than
anyone else because you're so biased
it's called proximity biased you're
biased to what you're seeing and hearing
all day every day and so it would have
been really easy for me to say oh I'm
not launching another business that
sells iPhone parts to iPhone repair
shops because there's so many of those I
get hit up all the time or I could have
thought I'm too late I'm too late the
iPhone came out in
2007 it's 2013 now it's been six years
we're oversaturated at this point this
is the peak yada yada yada and that is a
framework that I love okay and that is
the fact that b basically nothing is

[09:01]
the fact that b basically nothing is
oversaturated and it's basically never
too late to do or start anything we're
always early right you heard the phrase
in crypto or in investing or whatever
it's like we're so early we're so early
and it's kind of like a meme at this
point but like if you expand your time
Horizon which I'm always a fan of doing
zooming out even further which I love
doing we're still early we're early for
e-commerce Amazon has been around since
1995 30 years years which is crazy and
e-commerce still accounts for like 15
cents out of every dollar we spend
e-commerce is still early crypto been
around for 17 years 15 years depending
on if you count it from the white paper
or from whatever it's still early AI oh
my gosh we're a newborn infant with AI
the internet we're still early with the
internet and it's been 40 years I don't
care we're early we're always early so
if you really think you're late at
starting something just be sure that's

[10:01]
starting something just be sure that's
not a defense mechanism against being
scared to start something because we're
probably early there are of course of
course there are exceptions are we early
with selling laser discs no we're pretty
late and there are other examples but
there's always a way to put a Twist on
something that seems oversaturated on
the surface so don't sell yourself short
by saying ah this is oversaturated or ah
I'm too late I missed the boat bitcoin's
100,000 I missed the boat stop we're
early on all these things okay life is
really long there's always time and life
is long okay so I get this first batch
of iPhone parts from David I put them up
on an ugly shop if I site you could go
to the web archive type in lcdcycle onew
word.com look at the web archive from
2013 and you'll see what my site looked
like and then I used what was that
software called I don't think it's
around but it was the only software I
could find that would scrape Google Maps
and I scraped every single iPhone repair
shop in the United States by every MSA

[11:03]
shop in the United States by every MSA
Metropolitan statistical area from New
York City to Carson City Nevada there
was like 242 of them at the time and it
took days and I put them all in a
spreadsheet I had like 242 different
spreadsheets because I had to export
them one at a time and then I had to
combine them all with a macro and it was
just it was a little hairy but long
before AI there was Google and YouTube
and you could figure anything out that
you needed to figure out so I put all
the in a spreadsheet 20,000 iPhone
repair shops and I went to odesk.com
which is now upwork and I hired three
virtual assistants for 555 a piece
because odesk took a 10% fee and they
wanted to net $5 an hour and they were
experienced telemarketers and I opened
Microsoft Word and I typed out an ugly
script and then I went to Zoho which was
like a CRM still is and I uploaded all
20,000 leads and then I said okay I want
you to call these repair shops and say

[12:00]
you to call these repair shops and say
I'll pay you $3 a unit for your broken
iPhone screens and we'll send a prepaid
shipping label and we'll pay you via
check or PayPal and so they did and
guess what these ugly cardboard boxes
started showing up at my house in
Harvest Alabama and there were these
boxes that always look beat to heck and
they had never packaged them well and so
you would just pick it up and shake it
and it just sounded like broken glass
because that's exactly what was in it
broken glass
sometimes the glass shards would
literally be falling out of the corners
of the cardboard boxes and we later
learned to educate them on packaging
them better and I would set them down on
my kitchen table I'd stack them high I
still have pictures of all these and we
would buy these testing units for like
$15 from China that was like a little
electronic box and you would attach the
iPhone screen to the unit and it would
basically mimic what it would look like
if it were lged into an iPhone and you

[13:00]
if it were lged into an iPhone and you
would make sure that there were no dead
pixels and if there were dead pixels
then it was worth significantly less
maybe 25 or 50 cents still worth
shipping and if there were no dead
pixels it was worth about6 OR7 and we
were paying $2 to $3 for them so we
would just make a margin we test them
all and we notate in a spreadsheet how
many were dead pixels how many had a
dead digitizer how many were perfect
great ABC and then we'd get a bubble
wrap and we'd get a long strip of bubble
wrap and we'd lay them all out and we'd
roll them all up with bubble wrap in
between each broken iPhone screen and
then we'd get these massive foam boxes
and I had to figure out how to work
customs and we would ship these 40 PB
boxes of broken iPhone screens to
shenzen China and I kid you not we would
actually ship them to Hong Kong because
the tariffs were crazy if you ship
directly into China Mainland we'd ship
them to Hong Kong and someone told me
this once I don't know that it was true
but I believe it and some dude would put

[14:00]
but I believe it and some dude would put
these boxes these foam boxes covered in
cardboard covered in yellow tape and put
them on like a literal rowboat and row
them across the Hong Kong Bay and that
was like the most cost-efficient way of
them getting across I don't know if it
was shady I don't know if that was
business as usual over there I don't
know but someone told me that once and
it blew my mind and then I went to China
and I saw how things operated and that
actually sounds quite believable from
what I witnessed over there so this
business just was Gang Busters and it
was the perfect example of product
Market fit starting a business usually
feels like pushing a boulder up a hill
and you make progress but if you rest
then the boulder roll rolls back down on
you but sometimes when you have product
Market fit if you should be so lucky the
boulder is chasing you and you are
sprinting down the hill and you can't
even sleep because you're just cash and
checks and breaking X baby and people
are beating down your doors to buy
whatever product or service that you
might be selling and that's what I had
here and it I don't normally get product

[15:01]
here and it I don't normally get product
Market fit and you don't have to have it
to launch but sometimes you do sometimes
you get it even though it was six years
quote too late even though it quote
seemed too
oversaturated so that is the framework
of all Frameworks for today's podcast is
don't be sold into thinking that
something's oversaturated and if you
really think that then at least get the
research to back it up for instance in
our tree trimming business we know that
the Baseline is one tree trimming
business in any given City for 10,000
residents so if we want to open in a
city and it's one in 5,000 then we know
it's twice as saturated as what we're
used to as what the Baseline is so we
might be hesitant to open in that City
we might be able to go one city over and
see it's one in 20,000 all right if you
are watching this clip right now you are
watching this on YouTube and if you are
a fan of podcast please check out my
podcast while you're at it because
sometimes I have podcasts that aren't on
YouTube and sometimes I have YouTubes
that aren't on podcast so check out the
ker office on any podcast platform or
you can go to kod.com also my newsletter

[16:01]
you can go to kod.com also my newsletter
will throw that in there there are no
ads It's weekly it's different content
than my podcast and YouTube newsletter.
chrisj ker.com You'll see the link and
we'll see you there so things can be
oversaturated in relation to something
else a different Market but generally
speaking even if we open in the market
where it's one in 5,000 those guys are
probably sucking in a lot of things and
we can probably do things a little more
uniquely or a little better and win over
there so this business LCD cycle it took
off like a rocket ship and we did 28,000
month one 56,000 month 2 and 150,000
month 3 which would have been March of
2013 and e-commerce is hard and in one
sense this was import export in another
sense it was e-commerce because most of
our money was made from selling parts
that's what we did we would send someone
money for their broken screens and then
we would come back and say hey we also
sell parts on our website LCD cycle.com
and it was a beautiful business because
it was 93 is% recurring if an iPhone

[17:02]
it was 93 is% recurring if an iPhone
part store bought from us they were
likely to buy from us every single month
and we kind of changed the industry in a
couple ways we were the first company to
Institute a lifetime return policy which
no one had ever done before and that's
another framework for you like it was
just marketing like if someone three
years after buying a screen wanted to
return it yeah we would take it back but
guess what they didn't that didn't
happen that's just not how the industry
worked so when you offer a lifetime
return policy or a no-brainer offer as
Alex horos likes to say sometimes it's
much better on the surface it's a it's a
better sales pitch than it is an amazing
offer because it's just framed in a
different way I know mathematically
speaking that most people will never
take me up in the lifetime return policy
and the ones that do I just work that
into the price and so it took us a
couple years to Institute that but that
was a game changer but the biggest thing
we did was free shipping over $200
because our average order value was

[18:01]
because our average order value was
about
$170 and so we knew that if shipping was
$15 then we could encourage them to
increase their average order value AKA
buy more from us and they could get free
shipping and then the biggest unlock
ever of this whole business was I just
looked at a map one day and we were in
Huntsville Alabama and I said okay where
are all my customers Chad noua where are
all my big customers Chattanooga
Tennessee Nashville Tennessee Birmingham
Alabama Atlanta Atlanta Atlanta we were
all over the southeast in this little
pocket it's like okay in a way this
makes sense because I'm in Alabama but
in a way it doesn't make sense because
most humans in America live in the
Northeast right there's 30 million
people in Florida there's 3540 in
California there's 30 million in
Florida's actually more like 20 I think
there's 30 something million in Texas
and then in the Northeast there's along
the west coast there's 150 million
people or east coast and we're calling
all of them my vas don't care who they

[19:00]
all of them my vas don't care who they
call on so I started asking my customers
and that's another good framework talk
to your freaking customers get them on
the phone regularly block out spots on
your calendar they will tell you things
that you never knew oh yeah I don't buy
from you because of your lifetime return
policy you I buy from you because your
shipping's free and I'm within a one-day
shipping radius so that means I get it
the day after ordering which means it's
like paying $50 for overnight FedEx when
I'm just getting it next day because I'm
close to you that's what I was learning
and it was a GameChanger so I
immediately I remember where I was at
the time and I thought why are we in
Huntsville Alabama again oh because I
happened to live here when I launched
this business okay well this is blowing
up we're going to do five million bucks
our second year we did 2.1 our first
year we were profitable why am I still
in Huntsville so I went to my wife and I
said hey what do you think about moving
she's like I'm done so where well I
opened up fedex.com I went to their
FedEx Ground map and I went to ps.com
looked at their ground map and they have

[20:00]
looked at their ground map and they have
a little calculator you can put in a zip
code and it will show you the you know
the overnight shipping radius map so I
looked to La Chicago hit a bunch of big
cities New York I'm not moving to New
York okay Orlando I grew up there we
could ship to all of Florida and most of
Georgia in Orlando but Ah that's only a
small pocket of people I don't want to
live there and then I looked at Dallas
and it's like Dallas 7 million people
San Antonio 6 million people Houston 6
million people Austin 2 million people
great you know Greater Austin Greater
Houston Little Rock shreport Oklahoma
City all of these cities all of Texas
were within a one- day shipping radius
it was a no-brainer to me it's like oh
oh I need to move to Dallas okay I need
to leave Huntsville open keep someone
here to manage the shop and I need to
move my family to Dallas because you
know what I wouldn't mind moving there
anyway and so 10 years ago almost 11 now
10 and a half years ago we moved to
Dallas and we bought a house and we been
here ever since and that was the thesis

[21:01]
here ever since and that was the thesis
I can acquire more customers in Texas
because I'll be able to ship ground but
they'll be able to receive overnight and
that thesis worked so that caused us to
open a third Distribution Center in
Orlando where one of my business
partners ended up living or one of my
friends who ended up becoming my
business partner was already living and
then we opened up in Michigan because
MIchigan hit a bunch of those
Northeastern cities within one or two
days so we had four distribution centers
around the country and we were cranking
out close to $10 million a year
profitably now eCommerce wholesale is a
hard hard business because if you're
growing let's say your net margins when
in a high growth phase are 10% but
you're growing 20% a month that means
you are profitable but your cash flow
negative cash flow and profit are not
the same thing okay cash flow is what's
left over in your bank account at the
end of the day profit is are you able to

[22:00]
end of the day profit is are you able to
sell something for $2 that you bought
for $1 hopefully you have both
profitability and cash flow sometimes
you don't especially if you're growing
fast so we were profitable but cash flow
negative and so thank you John Nolan he
was a guy that I went to church with he
had started and sold a very successful
Consulting
business and he was a great guy and he
wanted to support young entrepreneurs
and so I went to him and said hey John
do you invest in businesses and he said
well I own a small percentage of a bank
and what I like to do is I will co-sign
on a line of credit with you and then
you can use that line of credit to grow
your business and if you ever go belly
up then I've got to come out of pocket
to pay that off to the bank but if you
don't then it's kind of nice because I
don't have to come out of pocket to make
this investment and he just preferred
that structure and so we did that I took
out a quar million dollar line of credit
with this Bank in Alabama and it was a
great partnership I used them for a few
years I kept the line of credit as low
as possible and that enabled us to run

[23:01]
as possible and that enabled us to run
and grow the business and he didn't want
any Equity the only thing he asked for
was for me to donate to his nonprofit
which was a nonprofit that helped like
single moms mostly people that were down
on their luck helped them earn an
education or a skill so they could be
self-sufficient and so I did it was just
a handshake there were no papers signed
I donated a percentage of our Revenue
every single month to his nonprofit and
then when I sold the business I donated
a percentage of that as well and it was
a great beautiful partnership that I'm
very grateful for but there was also a
time that came when I needed more money
I I thought I needed a million dollars
and this was kind of an interesting
turning point in my life I was living in
Allen Texas at the time and we were
growing really really fast and the line
of credit just wasn't enough and we
could keep going without any more money
but I wanted to grow faster I wanted to
grow more and I just started cold
emailing Venture Capital firms in Utah
and Alabama Alabama CU that's where our
company but he was headquartered even
though I was living in Texas at the time

[24:00]
though I was living in Texas at the time
and in Utah because I have ties there
through the church that I'm a member of
the Church of Jesus Christ the Latter
Day Saints I thought it might be easier
to raise money there so I flew out to
Utah I had some meetings with uh
Peterson Partners Peak Ventures a few
different companies and it went okay but
nothing really ever came of it and then
I found this company in Birmingham and
they were great and I drove out there
and I met with them and they love me and
I love them and they and we had talked
about them investing a million dollars
for 25% equity and we shook hands on
that I met the team we verbally agreed
to it and then they just dug their feet
or they they drugg their feet forever
and ever and ever and it took like six
months for them to actually produce a
term sheet which is basically a letter
of intent with the terms of the deal on
it and so maybe it wasn't six months
maybe it was three I don't know but it
seemed to take forever and it was a
no-brainer we were still growing fast uh
we still needed the money and but as a
member of my church I wanted to pray

[25:01]
member of my church I wanted to pray
about this and so I prayed about this
with my wife and something weird
happened I started to pray and I forgot
what I was praying about entirely and
that was very abnormal for me that never
happened and in our church we teach that
if you're praying about something and
the answer is a no you're going to have
what we call a stuper of thought which
means like you have a stuper of thought
how else do you explain it but if the
answer is a yes then you're going to
feel good about it right you're just
going to you're just going to feel good
it's going to feel right I had never
experienced I had experienced a lot of
you know no answers to prayers but I had
gotten some yeses and I'd never gotten a
no I'd never gotten a clear stuper of
thought until this moment and so the
answer was no and that made no sense to
me because in my head it was a yes this
was a no-brainer and so I went back to
them and I said no you I don't know why
it's no I just this doesn't feel right I
think I can get by without it I'm not
going to go raise it from someone else
I'm just going to try to make it work
and so I did I made it work we kept
growing we did 5 million we did 10
million but 3 four five years in we' had

[26:01]
million but 3 four five years in we' had
been very profitable I built this
awesome house I made more money than I'd
ever made in my life in my 20s and I
didn't have any debt you know the line
of credit I kept at zero after that
second year or so and it was just a cash
flowing machine but then we started
shrinking and I couldn't really turn it
around and there was a lot of
competition the market had kind of
changed a little bit and a lot of times
in business you get this you know you
get to the 10 million Mark and it's
really hard to break through from a Vue
perspective from a people perspective
and I was managing 23 people across four
different states not doing a super great
job at it not visiting them enough of
course I was distracted I was testing
other businesses and Concepts if you
listen to my every business I ever
started episodes which are episodes see
14 21 88 and then I forget which the
last one is anyway the 75 businesses I
talk about was happened during these
seven years of running LCD cycle
and so the business started shrinking

[27:00]
and so the business started shrinking
every year we got to 10 million and then
it was 8 then it was six and then I had
a falling out with a business partner
and a friend and that was terrible this
was 2017 2018 2019 and then finally I
ended up just selling off the customer
list for pennies on the dollar so to
speak based on what it used to be worth
but it was interesting because a lot of
times people think of a business failing
and they think of everyone losing or
declaring bankruptcy but it doesn't go
like that sometimes you just wind stuff
down and you're profitable the entire
way from start to finish you're
profitable the whole time and that's how
I was we you know we were banking
profits every month up until near the
end and I just saw the riding on the
wall so we had to keep laying off people
and shrinking and getting more lean more
agile more Nimble and then we just kind
of sold it to a competitor and we locked
the doors and walked away so to speak
but I don't really know what I would
have done differently you know they say
businesses don't really ever fail the
founders just run out out of energy and

[28:00]
founders just run out out of energy and
I can definitely see that happening here
I could have made it work I could have
raised the money and gotten over that
hump so in retrospective in looking back
on that why did I turn down that million
dollars I thought I had the answer but
then a couple years ago I got the real
answer and so I thought the answer was
well because you know I was going to
those investors would have lost money or
I could have said you know if I would
have raised the money then I could have
used it to grow the business and gotten
over that hump and we could have been a
$50 million business I don't really
think I could have done that even with a
million dollarss and so I used to think
the answer that I said no was because
investors would have lost money and I
would have felt terrible about that but
then years later I went back to those
same investors to raise money for my
third party logistics company send eats
he flew out to Dallas from Birmingham he
met with me we had lunch he loved the
business he gave me a term sheet again
and I looked at the term sheet and I
looked at it more closely and then I
went back to the old term sheet and I
looked at that one and they were about
the exact same and then I did more
research and I learned that their term
sheet looked about like every other VC's

[29:01]
sheet looked about like every other VC's
term sheet and it has what's called
liquidation preferences which means if
they invest a million for 25% equity and
we exit for let's say $10 million they
need to get their million dollars back
first off the top and then we split
everything else Pro right that also
means if they invest a million dollars
at a$ million valuation for 20% equity
and then we sell for
$100,000 which is a terrible out come we
just sell for pennies on the dollar then
they're going to get all of that 100,000
or if we sell for a million they're
going to get all of that million because
they have liquidation preferences they
get their million back first and that's
not like a vulture Clause that's not
unethical that is standard that's very
standard sometimes they have two act
liquidation Clauses where they need to
get $2 million back first and then we
split at 8020 or 75 25 and so I realized
at that moment oh that's why the answer
was was to say no to that money because

[30:00]
was was to say no to that money because
had I said yes then the winding down of
that business I truly don't believe the
million dollars would have fixed us I
couldn't have just put it in my personal
checking account and lived on it that
would have been unethical but had I
wound down the business with their
million dollars with that term sheet
signed or with the contract signed I
wouldn't have been able have to just
live off the profits as I wound it down
I wouldn't have been able to build and
buy this house that we've lived in for
eight and a half years I wouldn't have
been able to have the life that I've had
I'm sure my life still would have been
fine but it would have been different
and I don't know what it would have been
and I think the life that I have is the
life that I'm supposed to have and so
I'm grateful that I got that no answer
because I wasn't supposed to raise it so
there's another framework for you seek
out experts when making these big
decisions maybe that expert is your dad
or friend maybe it's God as it was in
this case but that is the story of LCD
cycle it made me millions of dollars it
provided a Launchpad for me to do other
things and it's interesting because I
preach all the time you know Chase all

[31:00]
preach all the time you know Chase all
the shiny objects Chase all the things
do all the things say yes to everything
but you kind of have to get to that
point right I also preach that you
should follow your passion but not in
the beginning iPhone Parts was not my
passion it still isn't iPhone repairs
were not my passion the vast majority of
the 75 businesses I've started have not
been my passion but my passion is
business so in a way all of those things
are my passion but not following your
passion is is not scalable nor
sustainable but we should also do hard
things we should also be willing to eat
crap for years at a time so do things
that are hard and that suck until we
have the luxury of being able to chase
our passion and to chase all the shiny
objects but if you're still working 95
that's fine you could still Chase shiny
objects on the nights and weekends
launch a bunch of small things see what
really takes off and see which thing
reaches product Market fit which thing
keeps you up at night because you have
so much demand that's when you really
know you have something special you
don't have to have product Market fit

[32:01]
don't have to have product Market fit
but it really helps to have it hope you
enjoy this story thank you so much for
listening I would love it if you shared
this with a friend gave me a Fest star
review I don't have very many of those
but I'm looking forward to an awesome
2025 with you all on the ker office
