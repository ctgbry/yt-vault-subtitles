There's a company in Silicon Valley that
just raised $50 million and it's just a
sales agent. It's a rapper. Rappers are
raising eight figures. A week ago,
nothing was more low status than being a
GPT rapper. Turns out they were just
early to the game and that's all that
matters. Automation has already saved us
thousands and thousands and thousands of
dollars worth of payroll. AI in general
is the greatest leverage point that
organizations have to expand output
without increasing headcount. Everybody
listening, consider the door open. You
just have to walk through it.
Did you see this tweet from Greg
Eisenberg about Deep Seek and about
ChatG rappers and all that? Um, I don't
know. I'm going to read this real quick
cuz you're going to love this. Listeners
are going to love this. So, a lot of
talk about rappers like, "Oh, it's just
a chat GPT rapper. There's nothing
proprietary about it." And for those
listening, a rapper is just something
built on Chad GBT that you could do 90%
of within Chad GT built like around
around it. Yeah. Anyway, he says,

[01:00]
around it. Yeah. Anyway, he says,
"Deepse just proved the quote worthless
GPT rapper startups are actually the
ones with real moes. A week ago, nothing
was more low status than being a GPT
rapper." But I think we're learning
that's dead wrong. Turns out they were
just early to the game, and that's all
that matters. While DeepSeek, Meta,
Ananthropic, and Microsoft battle over
benchmark scores, these rapper companies
have been quietly building the only moat
that matters, interface loyalty, which I
have never heard that phrase before in
my life, and I'm obsessed with it. I'm
going to keep going because of how big
owning the LLM is for the national
defense and the economy. The next
breakthrough model is always two weeks
away. Deepseek launches today, someone
else drops a better one tomorrow.
Someone compared OpenAI to AOL, right?
like they put down the rails, they're
the first, but they're not going to be
the last, which I don't I don't know if
I agree with, but interesting take.
Anyway, he says, "Getting millions of
people to make your product part of
their daily workflow, that's the real
barrier to entry." Dude, I'm going to
read that again. Getting millions of

[02:00]
read that again. Getting millions of
people to make your product part of
their daily workflow. That is the real
barrier to entry. ChatGpt didn't win
because it had the best model. It won
because it was dead simple to use the
interface. And I think it has staying
power because of that. This is why all
those AI startups we dismissed are
actually positioned to win. They're not
competing on model performance. They're
competing on being the default way
humans interact with AI. Frontier models
are becoming commodities. User habits
aren't. While everyone obsesses over the
next architecture breakthrough, the real
game is being played in the interface
layer. The moat isn't the model being
the tool people reach for without
thinking. Technology advantage is
temporary. Interface lockin is forever.
keep shipping those rappers, my friend.
So, dude, what I was going to say about
your app is like people are going to use
that app for the next 20 years because
it's their recipe app. My my wife gets
her recipes from melskitchcafe.com
and we know Mel, she's a household name.
She has all the the stupid preamble

[03:03]
She has all the the stupid preamble
about everything. She has all the ads,
but her recipes are great. Guess what?
Like, she's been using Mel forever cuz
she knows the interface. She's used to
it, but she was switching a heartbait to
something without all that crap. And
your users will too. Once they learn how
to cook with that thing, they're never
like, you're going to have a thousand
competitors in a month, but none of your
customers will even know they exist
because they won't be looking for them.
Yeah. And that's what that's the logic
is like, dude, the market is so big. I'm
just trying to make a land grab at it.
And like that's it. Like, I'm with
everything that he is saying. we not
around an AI rapper, but we experience
very similar with creative OS like a big
a big throughine that we talk about is
how do we continue to ingrain ourselves
in the Facebook ad management workflow
because now when people are going to
start running testing new ads running
new ads they come to us first
like there are other templates on the

[04:01]
like there are other templates on the
internet don't get me wrong like decent
ones but Like everyone just comes to us.
It's where they have their saved
folders, their saved inspiration, their
saved like interface loyalty. We're
selling a commodity. It's ad templates.
Like you can go find templates for
creatives on Canva, right? But like
people like using OS for that same and
it's like it's the rapper like we
wrapped our templates which like
templates equals AI in this AI chat GPT
rapper world of like wrapping something
that is a commodity and something that
is not and it works like it's the it's
the lock in on on the brand loyalty and
and all of that and like again it goes
back even we talked about it of like
even just the the mass market we talked
about selection bias last time. It's
like very much like all of us exist in
this like kind of Twitter bubble or like
bankn bubble whatever where it's like
dude people don't like if I say the word
deepseek to my sister she'd be like it's

[05:02]
deepseek to my sister she'd be like it's
a new Indian restaurant she's like yeah
she's like what are we talking about dog
what do you mean like perplexity nobody
knows right and so it's like the
implementation of those tools
specifically
like into lifestyle or workflow like
doesn't mean anything to anybody. But
like instant chef does and it's it's
open AI. It is chat GPT. Well, I'm not
even I'm not even building a custom
model or training it. I'm just like
going to let it rip and trust that the
user is only going to ask it cooking
questions and that it can answer cooking
questions. And you know, they're going
to they're going to start using it as
their Chad GPT. The grandmas that don't
know about Chad GBT, they don't know.
They're gonna they're going to tell
their grandkids, "You have to download
Instant Chef to help you with your
homework." And they're like, "What are
you talking about?"
It's like, "Yeah, dude. It just helped
me build my workout plan, dude. I don't
know. It's so capable." You know what I
mean? It's like, but that sort of stuff,

[06:00]
mean? It's like, but that sort of stuff,
like I think what what Greg is saying is
is spot on is like we're in an
interesting position from a a market
saturation space. I saw even your your
video of the chat GBT operator doing the
Facebook outreach and it's like dude
those people have no idea that that's
even possible like
zero dude you could build a rapper that
does that for people like flippers
people selling stuff like bro it's like
the rapper game is unreal like cuz all
technology is really at the end of the
day is like data and the ability to move
and manipulate that data and then
display it to an end consumer. Mhm. The
back half of that is like dude there's 9
million APIs. Every software tool has
one like you can like you can always get
and manipulate data super easily. Yeah.
Whether it's the open AI I've been
playing around with the Apollo API from

[07:01]
playing around with the Apollo API from
a lead genen clay, right? Like there's a
billion. There's those are all rappers.
Like they're all rappers.
But you even you like the techiest of
tech and you're using Chad GPT like
we're still using rappers, right? We're
not the use case for like it's an
interface. It's a specialty. It's like
like why why don't you use your tax guy
for your bookkeeping? He can do like cuz
I gota I want a bookkeeping guy.
Bookkeeping guy is just a a rapper for
the tax guy or vice versa. Right. Like
Right. Yeah. It's all it's all that. And
so I think it it the nice part the
benefit to like people specifically like
with you know knowing your audience like
people that are trying to kind of step
into entrepreneurship or like any of
that. I think like I'm a big first
principles guy of like dude I promise
it's not as complicated as it sounds.
Like
launching an AI powered chef app is like
not some crazy situation. Like you find

[08:00]
not some crazy situation. Like you find
a contractor that knows this thing that
plugs into OpenAI. Like I don't need to
go build a custom model around this
perfect AI chef. It's like no. Like Chad
GPT Open AAI is spending all of their
money making the best AI chef. Yeah,
that's what they're doing. I just push
into the market. Paid ads to chefs.
Yeah. They're not running ads at their
use case being this perfect chef
situation. And that's the opportunity.
Like could you imagine if they were if
they had likeund marketing people throw
throwing Facebook ads. I mean that'd be
cool for them. I mean to be honest they
do. They have me they have you. They
have all of right. Like theirs is the
classic like B2B TOC. Yeah.
like they're selling it so it consumers
and so it's like it's up to us as that
middleman business to then take what

[09:00]
middleman business to then take what
they're creating which is so powerful
and turn it into something that's like
an applicable
use case. Why not just build a literal
Chad GPT rapper that's literally just
Chad GPT with a different name and it
has really big letters. All the font is
big and you just push it with paid ads
to people over 55 on it. People are
doing it. That's it, dude. You just call
it like lifehelper and it has big text
and it's GPT. Ask it anything. Yeah. 60
bucks a year. Oh my gosh. You know, like
again, it's like first principles. I
think I'll speak for myself. Like you
know that meme that's like the the idiot
and then it like goes up to the guy and
then Yeah, it's that. And I was spending
so much time as the midwit
almost out of like it's an ego or a
pride thing. It's ego. It's like I I
want to be like so smart that I have all
these things or whatever. And it's like

[10:01]
these things or whatever. And it's like
dude to be honest like I think I can
just stack a bag slinging an AI rapper
on Facebook ads. Like it's like going
back like dude like drop shipping. Like
no it's just you're just running ads.
You find something that works and you
let it rip. And now
I'm switching back. I'm going back down
the midweight side to the well maybe to
the dumb side. I don't know which side
I'm on, but doesn't really matter. I'm
just going to run more ads. And like
that's literally like my entire thesis
for the next like forever is like run
more ads at consumer products. And I
just like the monetization model and the
equity model and everything of software.
Yeah. And so it's like I'm just gonna
drop I'm like literally going to drop
ship software where I just spend $1,000
to build a prayer app, a cooking app, a
workout app, a productivity app, a
lifehelper app, a like whatever I can
think of and just run ads because the
asymmetric risk is like, oh, what

[11:00]
asymmetric risk is like, oh, what
happens? What's the worst? I lose five
grand. But like my upside is 30k in ARR
in an asset that's worth a h 100red
grand. It's like I'll make that bet
every day. Here's what you're going to
learn. You're going to run these ads and
I'm just completely making this up. And
for whatever reason, you're going to
learn that Asian-Americans are the one
paying and downloading for it.
Downloading it, right? And you're like,
"Internesting. I I really can't get a
good cost per acquisition from anyone
except Asian-Americans in Washington,
Oregon, and the Northeast. Huh?" And
then you're going to pay another $800
and you're going to build like an Asian
cooking app. Same thing. And then you're
just going to And then that's going to
be the final thing that makes your bag.
Like that's usually how these go. Like
where you start is not where you finish.
And that's the whole point 100%. Like
you start throwing I mean it's it's
unlimited content was the same thing. It
was an add-on service that then we
turned into a standalone cuz we're like
oh this is what people actually want.
like you know and so I think I think
it's like so it iterative and it's like
I don't yeah I'm not sitting here

[12:00]
I don't yeah I'm not sitting here
thinking the template that I bought for
this recipe app is God's gift to the
chefs like but it will be at some point
when I have six of them and like that's
the other piece like to your point it's
like why would I not have six why would
I not spin up vegan keto healthy not
healthy you know what I mean it's the
same thing I'm doing other I'm doing a
B2B version of this too right now. Okay.
And so a little bit more expensive of a
buy in six grand maybe five grand I
don't remember. And when you're doing
cold outreach you're using Apollo and
Instantly and like all of these
different tools to like go and send
these cold emails which is awesome if
you're like trying to go and bulk send.
I want to send 10,000 emails. That's
awesome. I also think specifically in
the digital service provider world that
there's a lot of boutique agencies and
freelancers that like aren't trying to
send a thousand cold emails a month.
Like I think that they want to connect

[13:01]
Like I think that they want to connect
with like five decision makers a month.
Yeah. And so I'm basically just taking
the contact data from Shopify store
decision makers that are doing less than
half a million dollars a month. Mhm.
Right. because that's higher propens or
higher odds that they want to work with
freelancers or need external support.
And then I'm just putting them all into
a searchable savable database with
oneclick email. You just click the
button that says connect and it loads in
a little prompt, a little cold email
script and you hit send and that's it.
You don't have to we're not talking
about anything. And it's just API
rappers like I'm just loading in contact
data and enriching it. It's like a a DIY
niche cold emailing. Yeah, rapper. If
you if your target market is Shopify
stores or direct to consumer brands,
like you just sign up for and I'm going
to charge way less to build a legit cold
email stack. You're spending $300 to
$500 a month between lead list

[14:00]
$500 a month between lead list
generation, enrichment, cold email, like
all the things. And I'm like, why would
you not just want to sign up for $200 a
year? Yeah. Because my cost is
negligible. And it's the same model.
It's like, do I think that there are a
thousand freelancers or a thousand
agencies that would pay 200 bucks a year
to be able to one-click email decision
makers at whatever brand they want.
Yeah. 200K in ARR. It's beautiful. That
on autopilot like like and I'm not
sitting here being like, you know what
I'm going to try to do is go compete
with Apollo and I don't really want to.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm good. Do I think I
can make $200 $300,000 a year on
relative autopilot just by spending
$5,000 and running some ads? And then
it's like I'm either cash flowing that
money because I'll have no team. No,
like I could have a VA run it for 1,200
bucks a month. And then it's like, all
right, it either sits there and cash
flows or I sell it for I mean 200 on a

[15:00]
flows or I sell it for I mean 200 on a
half a million to a million dollars,
right? Like and it's it's just a rapper.
if the ads don't convert very well, then
you just switch it from Shopify decision
makers to healthcare decision makers
like and try that. And that's how I had
him build it. I said, "All I need to do
is dual. It's a it's a relational
database with two sides, company person.
That's it. I'm just doing brands first
because I have boys that run newsletters
in direct consumer agency world and I
can just go to them and say, "Hey, I'll
give you a hundred bucks for everybody
you get to sign up." Like, call it a
day. to speaking of ecom. Tell me about
that guy that you know that has that
he's making bank with Shopify affiliate
links on Instagram. Oh yeah. What's
what's the play there? Yeah. So
basically I don't know if it's the same
program now, but like at middle to end
of last year, you're going to have to
remind me some of the numbers. I don't
remember exactly, but it was like you
sign up for he you get them to sign up
for a dollar and then if they it's like

[16:00]
for a dollar and then if they it's like
a dollar for their first like a dollar a
month for your first three months and
they were paying out like $100 in
commission for people that signed up for
that. Shopify was. Yeah. Which like I
think he's he's big enough like he's got
I I don't know if it was a custom deal
but like they probably hooked him up.
But then he was running ads and organic
at a many chat automation that literally
just pushed people that affiliate link
and they stopped selling all of their
ecom courses, drop shipping courses.
They stopped all of that. Give it all
away for free. Wow.
funnel just to do this program. Well,
wasn't the genius part was that he was
giving them like a free AI website
builder? Yeah. He partnered with another
whatever app and he was like, "Get a
free Shopify store. We will literally
build your Shopify store for you." And
like they'd swipe up, sign up for that
dollar, he'd get paid, then they'd
upload the theme or whatever it was. And
so it was just a phenomenal angle on

[17:01]
so it was just a phenomenal angle on
that offer. Not like get a free Shopify
account. It was like, "Yeah, free
Shopify store." Like what do I do with a
Shopify store? Right? Yeah, he's taking
away all that friction. Yeah, it's like
you could literally just start running
ads immediately by swiping up on his
story like in 2 minutes. Like crazy.
Wow. Okay, dude. I want to switch switch
topics. So, you saw my You should do
that for Go High Level. I was just
thinking that like I need to partner
with someone that offers like go high
level templates, right? You should you
don't need to you don't need to partner
with anybody. Just go and use theirs.
They have so many. And so like I mean I
give you mine from unlimited like an
automated local service review
automation, right? Yes. We will build
like literally literally fair. Okay. And
in theory you could charge more and
white label because high level lets you
white label and so you could turn it
into a digital service business pretty
easily. If you want to work on that,
we'll keep our other stuff uh quiet, but
like if you want to work on that, I I

[18:00]
like if you want to work on that, I I
know how to do it. So video is cool, but
you know what's better? Long form audio
via podcast and my newsletter.
tkopod.com.
Go there to subscribe for free to my
newsletter. It's one email a week. Very
tactical. And then go to my audio
podcast. Three episodes a week. Stuff
like this. You're going to love it. All
free. No sleazy salesbitch. tkopod.com.
Have you played around with a $200 month
OpenAI plan yet? Dude, you almost got me
to sign up for it last night. You got to
and then I just didn't. But I will. You
got to do it. I will. I sp so I posted
the video for those that didn't see it.
It was on It's on YouTube and and
Twitter. Thank you. It's me like asking
people if I can if they will pay me $200
to pick up their free piano, right?
Automated. And it like it fills out the
spreadsheet for me and it's just like
when my mind is blown about technology
that's saying something because I'm in
the game like I'm looking at this stuff
all the time. Anyway, so I spent an hour
this morning playing with it and I had
it do four things. Okay, I had it log
into my Beehive account, scroll through

[19:01]
into my Beehive account, scroll through
all my newsletters, click on the poll
that I put in every newsletter that
says, "How did you like this? Good, bad,
great, top tier." And I had it put
everything in a spreadsheet for me
because that's very tedious. There's no
way to export it. It's something I was
going to have to have my assistant do.
It did it for me while I worked. Okay,
so now I know my highest ranked
newsletters so I can improve my welcome
flow, so I can decrease my churn on my
newsletter. Yep. Awesome. Then I went
back to Facebook Marketplace and I said,
"I want you to search nationwide on
Facebook Marketplace for Gausny pizza
ovens. Find the same model, compare
prices, find the the Rockbox pizza oven
that is grossly underpriced compared to
market, and I want you to log all these
in a spreadsheet with the link." Boom.
It gets to work. And I'm just watching
it. You ready for it? Now, here's the
crazy part. I said every time it would
find one, it was like, "All right, I
found one. Is this good?" I was like,
"Stop asking me that. Just put it in the
spreadsheet. It's going to be good. Stop

[20:01]
spreadsheet. It's going to be good. Stop
asking. Don't ask for permission every
time. Just do it." Right. So then this
is what blew my mind. I went a step
further and I said, "Move faster." And
it did. No way. It moved faster. And I'm
like, "Okay, there's some technical
limitations." It just started. And I'm
like, "What is happening here?" Hell
yeah. You literally just all I had to do
was ask. Yeah. And so it did that blew
my mind because here's here's what I'm
thinking and I'm not about to start
this, but you know people listening like
retail arbitrage is like the lowest
hanging fruit of making money, right?
Yeah. So if I'm selling stuff in my
garage, I'm not going to list it on eBay
because there's more friction. I got to
ship it. It's a pain. I'm going to put
on Facebook Marketplace even though I
know it's worth less there. So I'm going
to list it locally, yada yada yada. So,
what this bot can do is it can go find
everything that's on Facebook
Marketplace that's underpriced and then
it can get an offer in place. Hey, I'll
buy this 150 bucks. Sure. Once it has
the the verbal yes, then it can copy and

[21:00]
the the verbal yes, then it can copy and
paste those pictures, put it on eBay,
list it at 300 bucks, buy it now, let's
say market price is 350, 400, sells
within a day, you sell it. Then you go
back to the Facebook buyer or Facebook
seller and say, "All right, what's your
Venmo?" You Venmo them. Here's my
address. You give them the address of
the buyer on eBay. You never take
possession of the dang pizza oven and
it's just re it's drop shipping through
a bot. It's literally what I did when I
first started all of this when I was
like 13 was doing that exact thing on
eBay with iPhones. Same. I did that with
iPhones. Literally all it was was like
cuz buy it now or like buy now had come
out. So it it superseded the auction and
people just wanted to buy stuff now and
they'd pay a premium on eBay for it. And
so then I would just list every iPhone I
could find. Yeah. Right. And like buy
now prices 20 30% higher than what I
knew I could get it for at auction. And
then people would buy mine and I'd go to
all the auctions that were about to end.
And then I'd be like and I knew my

[22:01]
And then I'd be like and I knew my
margin. And so I was like, "Cool, I can
pay up to 130 bucks for this iPhone 4S,
right? I get it for 110, change my
address to the one that they had and it
would just ship and I'd make my $20
split." I was messing around in like
eighth grade doing that exact same
thing. And now you can do it with AI in
a hundred years. Yeah. And the pizza
ovens it was finding were actually like
really well priced. Like they were
actually good deals. And I I chose pizza
ovens cuz I know the market and I wanted
to know how good it was or not. And then
so on another podcast episode I talk
about this idea called never call
again.com where you use AI agents to
call and get a bunch of quotes with one
click. Right. Yeah. So, using that
framework, I'll literally read you my
prompt right here. Are you ready for
this? I'm ready. This is my exact
prompt. I said, "Gather catering quotes
for a wedding in Dallas, Texas for 50
people featuring steak and two sides.
Reach out to 10 different caterers
through the not.com using an excessively
friendly tone in your communications.

[23:01]
friendly tone in your communications.
Provide the following contact
information for the inquiries. Use May
11th as a tenative wedding date when
required and submit these." So, I'm
reading this, but this actually isn't my
prompt. I I saved the task and it redid
my prompt based on everything that I
asked it after because my original
prompt was just like wedding in Dallas
for 50 people. I didn't even say a date.
And then it goes to the knot and I
thought I was going to have to create an
account, but it it didn't. It found a
way around creating an account. I didn't
know that was possible. It starts
reaching out to caterers and it chose
May 11th for me. And I'm like, "How did
you get May 11th?" And it was like,
"Well, it seems like a good enough time
to prepare for a wedding." I was like,
"Let's roll with that." Okay. Yeah. And
it starts reaching out to these
caterers. And then I was like, "Move
faster." And it did. And then I start
getting emails back from caterers that
think I'm having a wedding. That's sick.
As I worked, you doing? That's sick. All
right. You convince me. I'll sign up
tonight. I'll be playing around. Dude,
Lauren's going to be like, "What are you
doing over there?" Like, dude, playing

[24:02]
doing over there?" Like, dude, playing
in the wedding. Dude, two more use
cases. I said, "Go to Zillow. find me a
for sale by owner home that's
significantly less than this estimate.
It needs to be at least uh three months
old. It took 12 minutes, but it found
me. Like it it found one for me. Like if
I were a flipper, boom, there's one that
I could flip immediately, dude. And then
I say, "Go to AliExpress. Find me 10
companies that will send me uh free
samples." And I said, "I'm going to
assume that the products on the homepage
of AliExpress are trending. They're
viral. They're bestsellers. So, just use
the homepage as your guide and it it
starts messaging sellers about earbuds.
I got people trying to send me free
samples of earbuds from China now. So,
good. What is happening? So good, dude.
Talk me through the tangibles of this.
Right. And so, can you have multiple
operators running at once? I don't think
so. But you know what? Let me try right
now. I'll answer that question right
now. Two tabs open, baby. You know what
I mean? That's if that's all it takes.

[25:01]
I mean? That's if that's all it takes.
I'm and so then the login function for
you is what you just take over the
screen and log into whatever your
account is on the browser that they
have. So like Zillow as an example or or
Facebook. Yeah, I'll show you how it
works. So, find a dirt cheap flight
leaving from DFW to either LAX or JFK
sometime
over the next six months.
Non-stop under $100 round trip on Google
flights. You ready for this? I'm ready.
Let's see what happens. Can you see it?
Okay. This goes back this. Yeah, I can.
This goes back to that trip trip trip
idea that I had. A literal travel agent.
Remember I made the AI like travel
planner. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Literally that. Dude, this takes it a
step further. Yeah. This goes I'll
actually do it for you. All right. So,
for those listening and not watching, it

[26:01]
for those listening and not watching, it
opens up Google Flights. It's typing in
DFW
and it like it literally behaves like a
human. Like it will click the wrong
thing. It'll go back. Like you like
you've seen bots, right? I've watched a
bot control my screen and it's like it's
a computer. It's tactical. It's binary.
It's like dude click. Like it doesn't
make mistakes. But like I feel like the
genius of this is that it does make
mistakes. It looks like human behavior.
Like scots cheapflights.com,
right? That's like a $20 million
business. You pay $100 a year to get
cheap flights. I don't need that. Right.
I could run a task to do this for me
every morning. So sick. You watching it?
Yep. And then at any point I can take
control. But you see this? I've only
given it one prompt. Look, 16 $69
non-stop flight from DFW to LAX, dude.
On April 1st. I'll see you April 1st. I
don't have an excuse now. You kind of

[27:01]
don't have an excuse now. You kind of
have to, dude. It's only 69 bucks, dude.
That is really cheap, actually. Right.
Holy cow. When you said some 100, I was
like, dang, that's a stretch. But hey.
Yeah. Look, there it is. It says right
here, "Worked for two minutes." There's
the entire log. It takes a screenshot of
what it does. So, I can go back and
look. I found a roundtrip flight from
DFW to LAX and Google flights for $69
with Frontier. The departure is on April
1st. Return on the 8th. It's non-stop
flight. You can view the details. Crazy.
Should I say book it? Yeah. I'm unable
to book it. Interesting. Anyway, so like
my mind is just blown. Like I'm not
sleeping tonight. I'm just going to keep
playing with this. I'm with you. I'm
about to get deep in the weeds. It's
just a growth hacker's dream. And the
moment that it gets super interesting is
when that can start to happen without
the oversight to the same degree and
running multiple at the same time,
right? Cuz it's like all of a sudden the
big thing that I've been uh thinking
about on that is just like where does

[28:01]
about on that is just like where does
and we do it with not AI so much with
automation though within all of our
service businesses, right?
automate as much as possible, but it's
like at what like where are the human
checkpoints? Like when is it right for
us, we kind of draw the line at at human
conversation. Like I won't send a AI
generated email to a client without a
human looking at it. But at some point,
I feel like that won't be the case. And
you can have AI check AI. Be like, does
this match this? You know what I mean?
Yeah. Checking in on each other. Yeah.
like here's what's good. And so I'm
curious around some of that cuz it's
like I mean automation zap year as a
very like broadstroke for people like
has already saved us thousands and
thousands and thousands of dollars worth
of payroll, right? And it's like this is
the next layer of that where it's truly
they branded it extremely well. I'm a
fan of operator, right? Like it's
perfect an operator. It logs everything

[29:00]
perfect an operator. It logs everything
in a blank spreadsheet. I don't put any
column headers in there. So, I just
figured out, by the way, to answer your
question, I opened a tab. I duplicated
the tab. In one of them, I started a new
prompt and I said, "Now do DFW to
Orlando." And the other one, I said,
"Find me a flight from DFW to Seattle."
And they're both running at the same
time. How many tabs can I do? That's
what I'm saying. You have a little army
going right now. Thank god for Arc, huh?
I'm a fan. I'm a fan of Arc Browser. Arc
browser. Oh, dude. You're going to have
a whole workspace, like a whole new
space that's literally just all
operators. You just name them whatever
they're doing. Why wouldn't I? Dude, I'm
going to get so much done this year. Are
you kidding me? Well, and it's like you
could have again
you hire one project manager
that just like lives in Arc with eight
operators. Yeah. And agents and Yeah,
dude. There's a company in Silicon
Valley that just raised $50 million and

[30:00]
Valley that just raised $50 million and
it's just a sales agent. It's it's a
rapper. It's it's an agent that goes out
and finds leads for you. So sick. Like
rappers are raising eight figures. Yeah.
As they should because again it's like
the underlying the underlying tech. Like
we think about it at Unlimited a lot,
right? Like we're AI powered blog
content, right? And like that's why
we're able to to get people SEO results
for way less money. And it's like the
backend tools and AI that we use is the
commodity. We can find a better tool and
just swap it out. We actually did. We
upgraded our entire system today. And
it's like, oh, our content quality just
went up or now we're going to rank
higher. Like not and like our clients
like they don't care if it's Open AI or
Perplexity or like it doesn't matter.
And so you just like can play the game
on the top by being the rapper and none
of them are going to like churn because
we aren't using this tool anymore as our
like it just needs to work, right? And

[31:00]
like it just needs to work, right? And
so it's like if you can then, you know,
say you build it on Open AI and
Perplexity comes out with something
crazy that's better for your use case,
you switch it over. Mhm. As long as
you're still delivering the value to
your customer, they don't care. What are
some other use cases for this operator
that you want to play around with? It's
an interesting one. When you're a
hammer, everything's a nail, right? I'm
I'm testing things that are familiar to
me. Proximity bias, but you're an idea
guy. What's relevant in your world? The
use case that I want is uh SEO, like
keyword research, competitor research
for Facebook ads, like, hey, can you go
and and you know, create a spreadsheet
of all the Facebook ad links for my
competitors? Like things like that. And
like because you can get pretty
specific, right? like we do at uh
Creative OS too with our inspiration
boards and it's like can you find me 20
ad creatives from uh Search Atlas that
have all been running for more than
30 days

[32:01]
30 days
and log their
URLs in a Google feed.
I'm doing something a little different
but I have a similar idea. So, I for
those listening, I shared my screen and
I said, "Go to the Facebook ad library
and find an ad that's been running for
over three months in the fitness niche
in the US." And Sam, explain to everyone
why this would be valuable in uh because
you want to know exactly what your
competitors are spending the most money
on as a soft indicator of what's
performing the best so that you can then
go and create similar content that has
higher likelihood to perform. So, it's
choosing.
Dude, this so cool, dude. Like, I'm not
even finessing it. It's just my prompt
is like 13 words long, right? I'm going
to blow this up. One sec. Here we go.
Now, it hasn't set a filter yet.
It will.
I was like, I have faith in this thing,

[33:00]
I was like, I have faith in this thing,
dude. There it is. Oh, don't click. No,
no, it's not. Oh my god. Go faster. Go
faster. Type it. type. Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Go faster or type the date in manually.
So, for those listening, the Facebook ad
library date filter starts in 2018. So,
that the agent is like clicking month by
month by month by month. It's crazy how
it's so smart in some ways and it's so
dumb in others. Yeah. Yeah. But now it
says entering the from date manually.
And sure enough, there it is. October
1st. First. Yep.
50,000 fitness related ads in the
Facebook ad library. yada yada yada.
Should I narrow down the results? Yes.
This prompt is really broad. Find the
ones that are winners. I wonder what
it'll take that to mean. One thing that
we do in the EU, they're required to
give you like estimates of how much
money has been spent on those ads. And
so we use that as a soft indicator. You

[34:01]
so we use that as a soft indicator. You
told me about that. Yeah. This is the
meta ad library in the EU, you're
saying? Yeah. Yeah. I don't I don't
remember exactly how we do it, but we
pull that data into Creative OS to give
like what we call our performance
indicator of like if these things are
being run for longer than X amount of
time or spent more than X in total
dollars, they would be considered
winners because like you're not spending
$100,000 on a single ad creative if it's
losing you money. Like it means it's
working. change it from on or after
October 1st to on or before because you
want it to be ads that ran longer than
showing the newest ones. Yeah. Like I
don't care about an ad that's been
running for 4 hours. Like we don't know
anything about that ad. And I'm going to
have it look for AI cooking apps. Hell
yeah. How about that? Hell yeah,
brother. AI cooking ads haven't been
around for more than three months, dude.
We'll see what it shows. Do you ever
look at sensor tower? Mm. What's that?

[35:01]
look at sensor tower? Mm. What's that?
It shows how many downloads apps are
getting for free. Oh, sick. You got to
check that out. I'm looking at it right
now.
Hell yeah. I'm excited to play in the
consumer app space a little bit. Yeah,
dude. I found one. Cooking AI assistant.
Let's see. Are you sick of working your
butt off posting something? I don't know
where it went. I think it's at the top
of this page. It needs to scroll up.
Look. So I can take control here, right?
It started running today. It's the It
didn't change the time filter. Oh, okay.
There's a Tai cooking app. Yep. There
you go. I like the one on the left. AIG
GPT app. AI chatbot for quick solutions
and cooking help. That's the all-in-one
app, dude. Yep. That's what we're
talking about. Yep.
It's funny because my daughter had like
a chat GPT app on her watch, but it
wasn't the right one. It was just
someone like keyword stuffing.

[36:01]
someone like keyword stuffing.
Literally, dude, it's crazy. Like,
they're literally like you say that when
you were you were like joking about it,
but like no, they're dudes that are
literally just running rappers that are
just straight AI assistant. Oh my gosh.
Yeah. All right, I'm going to change the
date right here.
Oh, I Yeah, I should have done this.
See, dude, even humans make mistakes.
and see what I think it will do. Did you
see that weird finger there? Yeah, you
can you can show it what to do. Oh, and
then it will like mimic your behavior.
Super interesting. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
That tracks. Oh, there's so much to play
with, dude. Yeah. So, it it found one,
but it's not an app. Anyway, yeah, dude.
This is just It's crazy. Like, you're
stupid to not just play around with this
stuff all night long. Yeah. Like, just
find whatever the use case is, you know?
It's like
especially for like solo shops, dude.
Like like AI in general is the greatest
leverage point that like sub five person

[37:02]
leverage point that like sub five person
organizations have to like expand output
without increasing headcount. And now I
mean we're doing it as well and like
trying to continue to use it a lot more.
Yeah, it's an interesting one. Like
it it just opens the door, dude. Like
consider the door open. Everybody
listening, consider the door open. You
just have to walk through it. Yeah.
Everything is just different forever.
It's actually insane. Well, dude, I
literally have a headache. Like, I just
get so fired up about this. I need to go
take my my daily boomer Tylenol for my
38-year-old self. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Come
