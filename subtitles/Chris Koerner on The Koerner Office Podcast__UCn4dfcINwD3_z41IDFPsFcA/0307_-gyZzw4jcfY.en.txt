welcome to the ker office I am asked
every day how I scrape things because in
almost every video or podcast I'm
talking about oh I scraped this and then
I cold email these guys and I texted
them this well what is scraping how do
you scrape is it hard do you have to
have technical knowledge no no no no
these are my four favorite tools for
scraping and I'm going to show you how
to use all four of them in this order
built with a secret hack a certain
Chrome extension Plus chat GPT and then
my personal favorite at the end outs
scraper validate a business idea find a
bunch of customers sell to a bunch of
customers get pricing info get market
research spy on your competitors what
whatever you want to do you're going to
know how to do by the end of this video
builtwith is great because what
builtwith does is it scrapes millions
and tens of millions of websites and
then it enables you to search through
those websites without having to have
any scraping knowledge and then export
them to your desktop so you can do
whatever you will with them you will get
email name phone um whatever technology
that this website uses maybe it's stripe
maybe it's Shopify maybe it's WordPress
it will tell you an approximate amount
of their revenue what is their Tech
spend every month or year it's just
super helpful and what I love builtwith

[01:00]
super helpful and what I love builtwith
for is just generating a ton of ideas
let's say I'm short on ideas which
doesn't usually happen but let's say I
am I'm just going to go through
builtwith and just start searching
around and looking for business ideas
let's do that right now on the fly so
let's say I developed a pet chw toy and
I want this chw toy to be sold on all of
the thousands of pet chw toy e-commerce
websites out there I would go to tools
and then product list and go to animals
and pet supplies and I would just export
this 5,000 websites maybe they're
WordPress maybe they're woocommerce
Magento it doesn't matter I'm going to
be able to do cold Outreach to all of
those store owners to help sell my
product maybe I sell email marketing
services for e-commerce Brands and I
want to know all of the e-commerce
websites built on Magento because I know
that no e-commerce email marketing
agency is only reaching out to Magento
stores most people have never heard of
Magento they're all going to Shopify but
magento's been around since long before
Shopify and a lot of their stores are a
lot bigger so I would go here I would go
to tools e-commerce list

[02:00]
to tools e-commerce list
Global Magento stores there you go
there's 125,000 of them it's feels
almost illegal that have this data at
our fingertips let's go to keyword list
and just see what pops up I don't know
why my browser is not loading images but
let's just click lawyer here's 95,000
lawyer websites maybe I want to sell
leads to lawyers I want to generate
leads through Google ads or Facebook ads
and sell them to lawyers here's all of
my potential customers when you export
them you're going to have approximate
text bend the URL the name of the
business social followers sales Vue
these are not very accurate some of them
are page rank these are very accurate
because I think it pulls from similar
web which is a website that tells you
how much traffic another website gets
phone numbers you can see about a
quarter of them have phone numbers
emails about half of them have emails
social URLs city state ZIP code when it
was last scraped so you can see how
relevant this data is let's say I want
just the top ranked websites based on
their Tech spend or their social
following or their number of employees
you can get that all right here once
again bit with is expensive $500 a month

[03:00]
again bit with is expensive $500 a month
but what's nice about this is if you
need really need some of this data you
could pay for it for 1 month cancel it
right after you pay for it and then just
spend 30 days exporting as much as you
can because it won't throttle you but
one little loophole I found for this is
to go to upwork or another like a Fiverr
type platform and post a job looking for
a virtual assistant or anyone that has
access to a paid built with account I've
done this before several times with
success and just say hey let me send you
20 bucks just run this export for me
real quick whether it's a million
records or a th000 records it makes no
difference to them it's no more work to
them so instead of paying 500 for all
the leads that you need you can pay 20
now this is directly competing with you
using my affiliate link but I don't care
I want you to win so save money if you
can but sometimes there is a need to pay
for this I've paid for this several
different times I'm not paying for it
right now cuz I'm not using it on an
ongoing basis and I'm cheap but that's a
lot of money so let's go to web
technology Trends and you can use this
just to start generating some ideas
there's so so so so many technologies
that these website use this is just a

[04:00]
that these website use this is just a
few of the more popular ones look at
stripe 3.3 million sites that use stripe
so this is built with it's cool I like
it I would appreciate if you use my
affiliate link but next I'm going to
talk about the random one-off jobs like
I really like this Chrome extension
instant data scraper I've used it from
time to time I have no affiliate link I
have no affiliation with them but
sometimes you need to scrape something
on a random website that's not Amazon
it's not Google it's not something
that's standardized to most of the
scrapers out there like out scraper and
so you just need a one-off Chrome
extension solution this works really
well you can train it you can say hey
scrape only the headings here or scrape
only these products here and you just
train it once you run it through a
sample make sure it looks good and then
it will just run on its own and Export
it all to a spreadsheet for you but my
favorite is use outcraze
I mean let's say let's not even let's

[05:02]
I mean let's say let's not even let's
say this is what one thing that we
actually use it for we own a tree chming
company in Dallas Fort Worth and we need
to find subcontractors well our
subcontractors many of them are listed
on Google Maps with their own tree
triming business they're a competitor of
ours and their partner of ours so I will
do this I'll go search tree service and
then I will only search for Dallas let's
say Dallas Texas check all those boxes
and then let's say huh I don't want it
to go crazy and charge me too much cuz
it does charge you per result very very
little but still so let's Max it at 500
just in case you hit the drop down what
all do I want to scrape uh I'm not going
to email them so I don't need that cuz
it costs a little bit extra you can see
0.3 for each result I just want their
phone numbers and the name of their
business and then actually I'm just
going to do 50 because I want to show
you how this goes and I want it to go
quickly so you can set Advanced
parameters how many searches per query
how do I want the data exported how

[06:02]
how do I want the data exported how
should I tag this and you can check or
uncheck all these boxes it'll take less
time if you uncheck more boxes and I
want to know the owners of the phones
nah I don't need to know that for this
it's not super accurate to be honest
that part the email validation and the
phone validation features are not very
accurate but I use live broadcast for
that for phone validation is it mobile
viip or landline and then for email
validation I use bulk email checker.com
those work flawlessly whereas this is a
little less accurate so I don't want to
pay for it even if it is cheap so I'll
just do this I'll do get data and it
will tell me how long it will take oh it
cost 40 cents for 50 results yes please
sending the
task all right then you go to the tasks
page and you can see that it's running
this probably won't take very long and
these are things that I've scraped in
the past like I'm using this every week
this was just last week last week last
week all the time handyman engraver
cremation cremation handyman hair salon
sometimes I'm just like generating ideas
with this and I have no initiative I'm

[07:00]
with this and I have no initiative I'm
just like this is my Play time this is
my free time so I will go ahead and I'm
going to export one so we don't have to
wait let's export hair salons and we'll
see what the results look like this is
what you're going to get it's a direct
scrape of their Google business profile
you get the name of the query the name
of the business you could delete most of
this stuff how many reviews what's their
rating you can sort by reviews sort by
number of pictures so this scraped
reviews and you can have it scrape only
negative reviews only two star reviews
based on keywords in the reviews so
that's a whole other feature where if
you want to sell customer service
software or agency services or anything
you could go look for a ton of
businesses to get one star reviews or
five-star reviews and then you can paste
that into chat GPT and look for patterns
and then use those patterns in your cold
Outreach to those businesses like hey I
noticed you have a hair salon but people
always complain that you don't have any
openings how do we fix that for you how
can I help you fix that or they always
complain that there's hair on the ground
maybe you should sweep up all that hair
here's some of the other things you can
do with out scraper haven't touched the

[08:00]
do with out scraper haven't touched the
vast majority of these grape stuff on
Shopify Tres pilot Twitter in my opinion
A lot of times if you do a little bit of
everything you're not really good at
anything so I love using outs scraper
for the Google business profile scrape
because it does that really really well
let's go here to this one because these
were not reviews I was helping a friend
with these he has an engraving business
all right so we open this and this is
what you're going to get when you
normally scrape a business based on a
keyword here's the keyword there's the
name of the business owner address phone
number boom boom boom it's all in here
super good and what I do here's a pro
tip if you do using Google Sheets like I
do I like getting it out of excel I must
be just a millennial whenever you paste
these phone numbers into Google Sheets
it will be formatted really wonky so you
have to remove all of the other symbols
in the phone number so I'll do plus one
space and remove all those and then I
will remove all of the dashes in the
phone number so I can stand standardize
them all that way when I paste them to

[09:01]
them all that way when I paste them to
Google Sheets it will look nice and
clean that's how you use out scraper
back to this instant data scraper one
thing that's good for is we wanted to
make a database of all the horse
cremation facilities in the US and we
did it without scraper horse cremation
is not an actual Google category so it
was having a hard time finding them all
so we just found this random Humane
Society website that had all of the
horse cremation facilities listed we
used instant data scraper to do that you
can even use chat GPT to do that you can
just paste this stuff in and say hey put
this in a spreadsheet for at so lots of
cool tools out there please share this
with a friend if it's helpful subscribe
to me and uh we'll see you next time
