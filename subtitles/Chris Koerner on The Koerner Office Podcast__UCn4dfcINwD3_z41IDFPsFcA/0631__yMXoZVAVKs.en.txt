[00:00]
just saying I want to implement AI into
your business you're going to get sales
right out the gate because no one else
is really trying to help the small
business on AI just leave the tools
there cuz there's no cost to me walk to
the next business my hit rate was over
85 90% walking into a local business how
much are your biggest sass preneurs
making per month definitely High eight
figures we heard one that's getting into
the nine fig range one big customer that
could change your life I would go find a
franchisee customer that's part of a
small franchise or like 30 40 locations
crush it for them and then then get
[Music]
everyone high level comes up a lot on
this podcast and for good reason high
level has over a 100,000 customers and
most of those customers they call SAS
preneurs which is basically just a guy
running a marketing agency and that
marketing agency is entirely built on
and powered by high level you want to do
automated text back an automated voice
answering service cold emailing agency
website agency anything you want you can
build it all on top of high level and so
instead of talking to someone that's

[01:00]
instead of talking to someone that's
built a business on High level I wanted
to peel back the curtain and talk to the
guy that built high level that sees from
the inside who is having the most
success on High level and what are they
building what types of businesses should
you be building on High level where
you're most likely to have the most
success and so I had one of the
co-founders on Rob and Alex and I asked
them all these questions so whether you
already own a business and want to
seamlessly integrate AI or just a
cheaper CRM or you want to start a
business that can charge between $500
and $55,000 a month month to small
business owners you're going to love
this episode high level is an all-in-one
AI CRM platform and a lot beyond that so
we've basically taken everything to help
grow a business from top of funnel down
to lead management down to operational
things from automations connecting to
other software applications that you use
for your business down to like sending
invoices and managing your finances and
stuff like that so we're trying to take
over the world as far as what businesses
need but what we're known for uh for

[02:00]
need but what we're known for uh for
many is like being the CRM automations
platform it's a zapier that is more fit
for small businesses Andor marketing
agencies that's kind of one aspect of it
right yeah yeah exactly so the way that
we started I came come from a marketing
agency background as well as
entrepreneurship and stuff I've had many
business over time but prior to high
level I was actually running a marketing
agency and what I would do is go into
small businesses and do the traditional
marketing like oh we're coming in we're
running Facebook ads or Google ads or
whatever we're driving you leads and the
problem that I would have is after a
couple of months the business owner is
like what do I do with this like you
gave me a list of names or I'm getting
these emails that people interested but
they're not showing up to my door and it
was like this weird thing of like yeah I
don't know your business on how to sell
like your actual Services I know how to
drive interest to it you have to pick up
your phone and call them or try to
engage with them and book an appointment
and I ran into this pivotal point with
my company of like do I have to ramp up
a sales team because our turn number
we're losing customers as fast as we're
gaining them so I need to ramp it up on

[03:01]
gaining them so I need to ramp it up on
that side or do I spend time and
understand why my customers are leaving
and really turning into more of a
consulting company and so I decided to
go the route of being a Consulting uh
firm and we were actually helping
businesses you know like how can they
manage their contacts or leads and
really grow their businesses from ad to
Z and at that time my team we basically
created this infrastructure and you
mentioned zapier and it was like
learning apis coding things to
connecting 15 different applications to
help the management of these businesses
so that when leads and opportunities
come in how do you reach back out to
them how do you track it when that the
lead comes back in how do you make sure
that conversation is fruitful to get to
an outcome and in many cases that
outcome was like booking an appointment
or getting a sale or something what
happens after that experience you know
you gotta get reviews and so we built
this crazy infrastructure and what was
crazy about my journey in the agency
space I mean we had about 25 team
members about 200 clients on its peak I
received a random phone call from one of
my customers who are saying hey I got

[04:00]
my customers who are saying hey I got
approached by these two guys they're
launching a new software and they're
asking me questions I don't know like
how to log into things you're you're my
marketing guy Robin can you talk to got
on a call with them and got them set up
on what they needed and just started
talking to them and and they were
building reputation management
application and through that
conversation I was like well what does
your software do here's what I'm doing
in my business and I remember we had a
picture of the Whiteboard of like this
crazy schematic of what we're doing in
our business ran in there took a picture
and sent it to to them it's like well
what do you guys think and I'm like well
this is really cool it's like yeah you
know just hypothetically like what would
it take to build something like because
there's nothing online that has it and
know I have a little bit of a
development background you know built
stuff in the past but I was just like
what do you guys think and both Sean and
verun were like give us a couple days
we'll call you back and I thought they
were kicking me off the phone and you
know you never know you're they're just
being nice yeah being nice just give me
ah this guy just won't leave us alone
and you know they be working for megga
Corp right like so I don't know who
these guys are he's a project manager
and enough Sean called me two or three

[05:01]
and enough Sean called me two or three
days later and like hey do you mind
getting on a zoom call we going to show
you something and I remember when he
called me I was driving to the office
like 8 am here in Dallas driving to my
office and yeah give me like 20 minutes
and I'll call you back and of course I
forget to call him back get him my
coffee and you know just get my day
going he called me back Charles later
like hey where are you at you told me
you're gonna call me back jumped on the
computer and they had built out kind of
the version one of what high level is
today of what your whiteboard showed
yeah yeah and at that point it was you
know the leads coming into some sort of
kind of an initial version of CRM you
could do some basic automations and
communicate back and forth from a
Communications perspective conversations
aspect into it and then we were talking
about building a calendar tool at that
time and then you know how do we do some
automation stuff there but it was a very
initial version of high level rolled it
into a couple of customers that I had
internally an amazing success and then
it was like let's get to all my
customers and I just went back to Shan
and ruin saying hey this is incredible I
owe a lot to you guys you guys solved a
major problem for me can I get it out to

[06:00]
major problem for me can I get it out to
other agencies kind of dealing with the
same problem or other business you
wanted to resell it basically no I was
just like I just I'll refer them to you
like I just you guys you were just like
an evangelist I was just so happy that
they saw something so important for my
business and I know other businesses
dealing with it so go talk to them and
then they're like yeah go ahead and from
that point on you know I just kept
referring more and more people to them
and you know we ended up getting invited
to a conference for to speak and they're
like Robin you know everyone knows you
in that space so once you come and then
invite Sean so Sean and I flew out there
in San Diego and verun who's on the
other side in Guitar couldn't make it
but we met for the first time literally
on the flight there I'm creating a
landing you know kind of the the first
website this landing page and stuff so
that we can collect orders we get there
we present what high level is and
everybody in the room loved it it was it
was amazing and what was this conference
it was like a small business conference
about 20 people in person and 20 people
virtually it was you know oh that's it
coach so was really small so we had no

[07:00]
coach so was really small so we had no
idea what to expect we've never really
presented it you know anything like that
it's a new product I it was just we just
did demo in person and I remember we
were trying to sit back down people
called us back up like no no no no come
back up here we got more questions and
then you know people started asking us
question does it do this what about this
where you guys going with it and then
you know people are looking at the
website like okay hey do you guys offer
any discounts if we buy for a year or
anything like that and it's like we I
remember looking at each other and then
veron's on the screen behind us on zoom
and we're like sure we'll do it and I'm
like sneaking the way back to the the
computer like adding new products and
you know what's crazy we're now seven
years later we're about to hit 100,000
customers worldwide about 1700 employees
representing about two and a half to
three million businesses five million
users worldwide like the numbers are
just insane but it all came from you
know just word of mouth because we never
really did true sales and marketing it
was just provide as much good value as
we can to our customers and what
happened to me in my experience of like
wow this solved a major problem I want
to tell other people about it that's
been our mod in our philosophy since the

[08:00]
been our mod in our philosophy since the
beginning and that's honestly how we're
here today all right so let me see if I
can recap this so you had a marketing
agency with a couple hundred customers
presumably doing great right I mean 23
employees for a marketing agency is is
awesome but you kind of became a victim
of your own success because you you were
acquiring leads for your customers but
then they didn't know what to do with
them so they were churning but you were
doing your job you're like okay I don't
want you to churn so I'm gonna help you
figure out what to do with these leads
so that kind of pivot helped you acquire
200 customers and then one of your
random customers said hey these two guys
they're starting a reputation management
platform that's how they started
basically with that one kind of product
yeah a reputation management
communication tool okay so you got on
the phone with them just to connect apis
or whatever right and then you just got
to talking and you're like this is
interesting here's my vision for your
product I think there's actually much
more to it than this and you know which
people say all the time and it's like oh
cool thanks kid okay have a nice day

[09:00]
cool thanks kid okay have a nice day
yeah we'll we we'll talk later but
instead they're like this is brilliant
yes and then they just built it and then
you're like okay this is amazing I want
to share it with the world and you did
and then that in turn added so much
value to them that they went to a
conference to present and they're like
shoot let's get Robin over here he knows
the product better than we do and you
weren't even like a part of high level
right no I mean yeah like I just enjoyed
the journey like yeah you know I've
always had kind of the the the Mantra of
you're just going to do stuff for free
and as as you do good stuff for free
things will come back toold if you
provide good value it's honestly how I
started the marketing agency right so I
was just my whole thing like I don't
know where this is going to go or
anything but I'm just enjoying it and if
people pay me along the way that that's
great too we just kept going and it was
like honestly a good year and a half
before we decided to actually legitimize
the company of like formalize because it
was just all beta test you know like
just threw a product up and wow people
are buying it we never thought of like
let's slow down and like formalize a
company and at that point you know Sean
verun asked me to officially on paper

[10:00]
verun asked me to officially on paper
join the company and become a co-founder
of it so who was building out all the
tech was it Sean and oraron both of them
they both have a engineering background
as well okay and then what was the
revenue model in those early days how
much were you charging it's same as what
it is today we have $97 a month for one
location unlimited for 297 what about it
like at that conference what was the
feature the feature that just blew
people's minds like how was it so much
different from like the Hub spots and
the clickfunnels of the world one aspect
behind it was we took a lot of different
tool like at that point it was leads
come in and so you would have to figure
out some crazy way through zap year to
like pump it to a Google sheet and then
well you needed to do text messaging so
you need to pump it out to another
texting tool the interesting thing about
that is the cost of some of these
thirdparty texting tools was so tlio no
not not actually twilio but like think
of the software applications that set on
top of it like a skipio or like a call
rail or yeah like they charge a premium

[11:01]
rail or yeah like they charge a premium
on top of toio so what we said within
our software is well we're going to hook
up to toio because we know that's one of
the largest backend providers we'll just
give it to you at cost like that was our
whole model it's like instead of you
spending 50,000 cost yeah we're give it
to a wholesale rate and yeah and
actually you talk about the cost code
that is actually our business model you
know it's you pay for high level as
which is the membership fee and then
we're going to give you all these tools
super inexpensive or cheap or free and
give you the best value there and we're
just creating this massive store of
different products and so that was the
initial stuff that we built and then you
know we quickly rolled out the
opportunities board which a lot of
people were leveraging Trello at the
time like that was the hot product to
put you know what the opportunity board
was or pipe Drive which is pipe Drive
yeah and then it was instead of using
Le we have it built in the software
so just from those four or five tools
everyone in the room was like you're
telling me it's just one click you set
up a customer and all of this Tech stack
is there and I get to save money like

[12:02]
is there and I get to save money like
that was kind of the the big aha moment
for everybody there yeah well like gez
my I pay like 300 bucks a month for
zapier I've used pipe Drive in the past
I've used Trello in the past Callen Le
really adds up or like $18 a user and
then per team what's crazy for me about
high level that just broke my frame is
my entire life I've been saying you know
if you're everything to everyone then
you're nobody to No One you can't you
can't be the Jack of all trades master
of n y y and like I log in and you're
doing all those things and well like so
how are you able to break that that mold
like The Stereotype you know one of the
things that we talk about technology
mostly in this space is becoming a
commodity it's like corn The Innovation
curve has slowed down at such a level
that it's more about the execution of it
like there's distribution yeah and so
for us it's you know when a contact

[13:00]
for us it's you know when a contact
comes in into a CRM it doesn't matter
what CRM tool that that's out in the
world it's all doing the same thing you
can see the contact record and all the
like there's there's nothing crazy about
it know of course there's visual
differences and things like that but
it's it's the same and so I think you
know no no one was clamoring when we
came out of yet another CRM tool it was
just the fact that we Consolidated
essentially all the different you know
things at the grocery store we just put
it all into one place yeah that was kind
of the unique thing thing I and I think
just you know globally speaking in
software 10 15 years ago into what
you're representing it was like you need
to be the best of one thing and the one
thing only and be the premier product
behind it but you know I think we were
on The Cutting Edge of consolidating it
and now you see a lot of these tools
that were once the best at what they are
are now starting to go back saying we're
losing we need to now start building
these other functions and tools so I
think just as a world where we're
starting to figure out how do you
consolidate as much as possible have it
for an inexpensive price and then the
mation cost you know you mentioned

[14:00]
mation cost you know you mentioned
having different team members and stuff
like that you got six different tools
and when it doesn't work and you got to
teach them all the different tools
that's actually costly and you just
don't even realize that how much you're
spending from a Time perspective and
focusing on that so you yeah all those
things is what makes us special what's
the 8020 of what you guys offer like
what are people using the most I love
the 8020 rule you know that's what we
think about from a feature set when new
product right 80% of the feature set is
actually 20% of what you build out so it
it works really well there you know for
us it's definitely the top of funnel so
when leads come in say have the CRM
function doing the automations and then
the funnel Builder which you know if you
think about it you got to have a website
up any way that you think about it needs
to be able to collect data and then from
there when you collect the data it needs
to do something that is really the three
pieces that really pivot out to
everything else in the software okay is
your SMS feature growing in in
popularity oh 100 perc and so that's one
of the biggest products here in the
United States
now I will say as the larger that we've

[15:01]
now I will say as the larger that we've
gotten you know we're starting to see a
larger contingency internationally of
small businesses getting onto the
platform and WhatsApp is the bigger
player there so we're seeing a lot of
growth on that front and SMS is getting
more costly worldwide and it's becoming
very much more
restrictive you know unfortunately
there's two types of Bad actors you have
people who are going out with good
intention but are spamming people for
their product services with massive
paragraphs which no one wants to hear
and then you have the actual Bad actors
which coming with bad intention where
they're trying to do the scans and
things like that and so all the
providers are trying to figure out how
to stop it and you know it's now
increasing charges or just making it
more challenging to do it so WhatsApp is
becoming very popular same with
messenger Facebook Messenger as well so
of your 100,000 plus customers roughly
what percentage of them are end users
versus white label Partners agencies
yeah so we call the a white label
partners and and agencies you know put

[16:01]
partners and and agencies you know put
them in a bucket of being sass preneurs
that's like your Awards category yeah
and it's basically like you know you're
coming into our platform it's going to
be one to many and you're trying to
represent yourself as being a software
Provider from that outcome so we call
that sers that's probably about 60 to
65% of our customers um today it used to
be a lot higher I mean closer to 90% of
our customers um if not even higher but
it's slowly uh decreasing because what's
happening is a lot of small businesses
are coming to us who are really taking
taking on their own operations and
marketing themselves or they graduated
out of you know the SAS preneurs they
were introduced to high level through
their agency and now they want to do it
themselves they want to do it and what's
fun it is like you know I was working on
this agency I see the value of it I
wanted the agency to do more but they're
too busy trying to acquire new customers
so I worked out a deal with them I'm
coming straight to high level and
they're trying to now leverage it they
hire someone internally and they start
using it for their own business and then
over time they're like you know what I
love this model so much I now want to

[17:00]
love this model so much I now want to
become a SASS preneur and go tell my
friend so it's really fun to to watch
what that's happening and so like more
small businesses are coming to us kind
of in this dual fold situation now well
as an entrepreneur myself like it's it's
so hard to learn a really cool piece of
software and then not want to like build
a business on that like you you learn it
for your own use and then you're like oh
man it gets really tempting like oh I
could charge a thousand bucks a month
for this huh yeah it's I see the
business model and it's like I have a
little bit of extra time that I can
people that might want it you know it's
a little side money and then it just
turns into a thing right yeah it's like
I'm kind of sick of cleaning pools all
day like I can just hop on demos and
charge a thousand bucks a month yeah
that's the fun part about it it's and
that's I I think to the core of high
level it allows people to operationalize
their business that they thought wasn't
even possible you know like that pool
cleaner example that you gave it's
you're you're waking up super early and
you're working the the the list of
places you got to go all the houses and

[18:01]
places you got to go all the houses and
then you try to hire more people and
things like that in that Daily Grind and
you just think it's like you know it's
just a labor Rich business and that's
the business I'm in but then when you
start get playing you know not working
in the business but working on the
business and you start seeing how it
could be operationalized you realize
that your life can be a lot easier and
like well I can't keep my existing
business and maybe do something else
here so I think that is the fun part
about you know operationalizing business
are you seeing business owners that do
that just abandon their act their
original business altogether and just
being agency owners yeah I mean it
definitely happens I haven't seen a lot
where they just end up giving up their
business I think they kind of look at it
as I've operationalized my business I
have now a new team member who is now
going to own kind of the operational
side of it but now I want to be a little
bit of an evangelist of what I built so
video is cool but you know what's better
long form audio via podcast and my
newsletter TKO pod.com go there to
subscribe for free to my newsletter it's
one email a week very tactical and then
go to my audio podcast three episodes a
week stuff like this you're going to

[19:01]
week stuff like this you're going to
love it all free no sleazy sales
TKO pod.com so now it's I want to be
more like a business consultant or
implement this for other businesses
because you know I've seen the model and
I know that it's possible there and so
we're we are seeing a lot of that which
is really fun to see so if someone
approaches you and says Robin I want to
start an agency on a high level I'm sold
tell me what to do like what product do
I offer to what market like am I doing
SMS automation to agat guys or what's
like the the least path of resistance to
starting an agency on High level yeah so
prior to this year what I would tell
people is walk out of your house go to
any small business that you can just
walk into Main Street USA and just say I
want to put a chat widget on your
website and put a form on your website
those are two things that I can collect
leads on very quickly and what what for
free like I would I I mean I've always
been the person of lead for free and I
always do is like give you a little

[20:00]
always do is like give you a little
taste of it and then i' come back and be
like hey you know I've been doing this
for free what do you think and if you
like it I'm thinking about charging x
amount of dollars but I'll you know what
would you pay me and that that's
actually how I do market research on
figuring out like here's what my vision
of the price but what you're willing to
pay you know some people oh you're gonna
charge 500 bucks I mean you did you
started for free and I know you're
starting out yeah I'll pay you 200 bucks
like perfect you know I would collect
that revenue and now I kind of knew like
what the market would be right I do the
same thing it's like I want you to tell
me an answer I will not hold this
against you I promise I'm going to
charge you $100 a month for this which
is like below my cost like it's
unsustainable but like I'm learning be
honest based on the value you've seen me
add what would you pay and I'm going to
use that to charge other people you know
so it's like wink wink I'm not going to
charge you but what is it worth
genuinely and I will charge you 100
bucks is that kind of what you're saying
yeah yeah exactly and then you know what
what I would do is I I've always had
this thing of like I want to almost make

[21:00]
this thing of like I want to almost make
you feel guilty of me doing hard work on
your beh and so that in in that same
situation debted yeah and they they've
already told me what they're willing to
pay so they're almost like fine Robin
here here's the $200 that I told you i'
pay like you you killed it so keep going
and then I would just take that as a
reference to go to you know as go to the
next business and say I'm working with
Street and Sally over here is also using
me and they're paying this much you can
call them if you'd like you would you
like to get my services so that's what I
would do to scale it but in the business
today I think one of the big things is
doing missed call AI so when somebody
calls a business after hours it is very
costly because there are very important
leads that come through after hours and
no one's answering it so you're missing
the opportunities there and if you were
to hire a company you know the call
centers and stuff like that become very
costy as well well with high level we
actually built a lot of AI tools and so
you know there's this concept of Miss
call textb so someone called and you
could text them back saying hey sorry

[22:01]
could text them back saying hey sorry
we're after hours how can I help you and
at least you're keeping that lead active
but now people if someone's making an
actual call with AI and sophistication
that it's there you can actually have a
full-on conversation and drive that
person to the outcome that you would
ultimately have to do via text or or
whatever and we're actually seeing a
significant response rate into it mostly
with the outcome like booking an
appointment or you know getting it to a
salesperson or whatever but I think it's
so Cutting Edge and you know just when
you use that term AI walking out to that
business and just saying I want to
implement AI into your business and it's
something tangible that they understand
you're going to get sales right out the
gate because no one else is really
trying to help the small business on AI
it's always about the big companies and
Enterprises that I think most business
owners are seeing so before this AI
answering service you would have said
form and a chatbot on the website get
your and then sorry the third one was
the missc call textb sorry okay okay
yeah very like
tactically speaking how should someone

[23:01]
tactically speaking how should someone
approach that business owner is it
literally walking into a business is it
a cold call a text what do you have you
seen be the most effective not just for
you but for your customers all tactics
work I think that's something that's
important for everyone listening you'll
hear people like they'll give you
strategies on how to do cold calling and
how to talk to businesses or email you
know like you could send cold emails out
to people or Instagram DMs like all
those things work but it is a little bit
of I mean it is hard work because you're
going to get a lot of NOS before you get
the yes now for me it's always been I
you know I I love looking people in the
eyes I love you know when I have a
one-on-one conversation I want you to
feel my passion because that's the
passion I'm gonna put in my delivery so
for me it was literally just walk up to
businesses that I either knew or had a
small relationship or I knew the owner
something like that so then once I
expanded that Network it's well there's
a random you know clothing store down
the street let me just walk in and see
who I can get a hold of and just can I
talk to you about your business I looked
on your website you know my phone you're

[24:01]
on your website you know my phone you're
missing these things can I do it for
free and if I get results you know then
we'll talk yeah then we'll talk and you
know that's where I get into that pitch
of like you know hypothetically if I
were to charge for this service what
would you pay and I'm thinking about
this and you know kind of working down
that way but more it's just how do you
get the conversation and you know for me
I remember at that time starting the
agency it was I had to kind of build the
the the strength to kind of say I need
to go chase more Nos and you know it was
just like I'm expecting a no here
but I tried and so I got those Cycles in
and then over time you just build that
comments of like I got it yes what do I
say there how do I do this again right
and you start chasing the dog that
caught the car exactly Chase more nose I
like that phrase that I need to buy that
domain name so let's say what if they
have a website that just doesn't get
much traffic and you install the widget
in the chatbot and nothing happens or
the second question is what then you
install it and then they do get traffic
they do get leads what's the next step
in my experience with Mo mostly
businesses that's been around you know
in local towns and things like that

[25:01]
in local towns and things like that
anytime that I put the chat widget and
you know all the tools on the website
and the Miss call text back they
actually got a decent amount of traffic
that they just didn't even know like a
lot of people are Googling for this
business and trying to go to their
website to find them the phun like the
local plumber or the pizza shop or
whatever people are always looking out
for them because they just have that
local Authority I'm not saying to go to
the the big you know franchises like the
local the localist businesses they've
been around for a while people know them
and they're just trying to figure out
how to get in contact so I've always had
success on that front now for the a few
that don't have enough traffic or
whatever that's where you know I just
come into that business and saying look
you're not getting a lot of traffic
that's why there's not anything going on
but are you would you allow me to
actually run some traffic for you and
this is where I would you know try to
partner with somebody and resell their
services or try to figure out how to
compensate another person who's an
expert in driving traffic whether it's
Google ads or things of that nature now
if you don't have that relationship it's
okay okay just say I tried right and

[26:01]
okay okay just say I tried right and
then I would just leave the tools there
because there's no cost to me walk to
the next business but but like I said my
hit rate was over 85 90% walking into a
local business the local furniture store
that's been there for 10 years they just
get traffic and they just don't realize
that the traffic exists and you know you
gotta kind of Coach them through like
hey you got a lead in there call them
yeah people just be so fascinated and
surprised by it so are you're saying
your hit rate 85% that was like your
clothes rate when cold contacting in
person or that was the percentage of
people that had traffic to their site
that was my success rate of them having
traffic on their site my close rate was
probably you know one out of every 25
you know mostly when I was starting like
one out of 25 customers who'd be willing
to give me a shot but that progressively
got better you know once you have more
testimonials and being like I talked to
Bob I talked to Sally and all that and
then over time you kind of there's
levels to it right after you walk out to
a couple businesses people start telling
you like hey I see what you're doing you
should go talk to the Chamber of
Commerce and then you start getting in

[27:00]
Commerce and then you start getting in
front of that Network and then somebody
in there will invite you to uh something
else right like but it's just a lot of
it is just getting the Cycles in just
keep keep trying to talk trying to talk
to more people and have those
conversations what kind of price point
could you be able to charge for this
like not to start but like to finish at
well the crazy part about it is I know
customers that are selling it for tens
of thousands of dollars a month what
yeah mostly when you get into businesses
that have just High Revenue like you got
put a perspective of one lead that
you're able to provide to this company
could be massive so like in the pool
space right if you're able to take a
lead and they're able to convert on a
pool that pool project could be anywhere
from 50 to 100,000 maybe even half a
million dollars so you know being able
to say oh I'm only charging $50 a month
right that balance doesn't really Jive
over time now when you're starting out
initially yes I mean you're just trying
to figure out pricing mods but once you
build that confidence it's like I'm

[28:00]
build that confidence it's like I'm
going to go to Every Pool Company and
show them the model that here's the
reason I'm trying $3,000 a month or
$5,000 or $10,000 a month because I know
that the average Pool Company when I put
this widget on or Miss calls or whatever
20 calls in a month close five of them
yeah like you just run the math of it
and just that's why I charge this much
because my value is so important to your
business that you were missing out on
this whole time well people don't
realize how undercharging can do them
more harm than than good because of the
perceived lack of value in the price so
we're we're both on the same page you
start cheap dirt cheap embarrassingly
cheap but don't finish there right yeah
do not finish there feel comfortable to
incrementally go up and you know it is a
slow approach and there's a little bit
of internal conflict that you're
probably dealing with of like will
people pay for this I like this guy you
know I don't want to offend him yeah
yeah I mean these are the mental battles
that every entrepreneur deals with but
you need to figure out ways to continue
charging more and the fun thing about
high level that is you know it's very so

[29:02]
high level that is you know it's very so
much the Costco model of you come in and
you can charge your customers a platform
fee but on the other side of it is we
give you access to companies to resell
as well so think of like the text
messaging and the emailing things like
that you as the person who is a high
level offering to other businesses you
have a little slider that says I want to
charge my customer maybe 4X the cost of
this product so like texting is like
point 00 675 cents per message you know
fractions of a penny and so being able
to say like half a penny you know you
get to win on that Delta and so every
time that the customer spends $20 you
can make $5 off of it without having to
change your base fee and so all in all
you may end up making the three to four
or5 thousand doar a month but at the end
of the day it's you know how do you
continue to figure out expanding your
customer's wallet making sure that they
make money and you should be able to
make money on the back end as well what
about a pay per lead model do you do you

[30:00]
about a pay per lead model do you do you
have guys successful with that we
definitely have guys that that are
successful with it I think the challenge
with pay per lead is that I've seen
businesses tend to turn it on and then
turn it off right like for whatever
reason they they just don't consistently
buy the leads over and over again you
say your customers like in your platform
that's what you're seeing or oh no sorry
like as an agency if you're selling the
paper lead model to the small business
down the street you know usually people
are like I have this fixed budget i'
I've done them math so that equals about
you know 45 leads and then once they hit
that point they typically stop um
because they're like well I pre you know
I paid for this or I mentally prepaid
for it um whether it's upfront or just
in my mind and then it's like well I've
already made an x amount of investment
let me see if I can work these leads and
the problem is good job in working it
and all that and so it's more about the
outcome for me not so much of just the
the lead and then good luck it's no
different than Facebook or Google ads
like
you know I'll run a campaign 100 a day a

[31:00]
you know I'll run a campaign 100 a day a
thousand a day and then it's like okay
this is working but I need to let's
catch up pause it right and then a lot
of times I never restart it because
something happens right yeah so so
you're saying like you know there are
exceptions to everything but on the
whole flat fee per month is the way to
go and I think just as you know think
about life in general right like don't
you like to have just your Netflix bill
like you you like to have it just nine
bucks a month and then when they try to
do the price increase it it hurts a
little bit but you end up sucking it up
because it's I know for the next 12
months it's going to be this fixed rate
when you have something that's
utilization based you need to make sure
that it is being used for a positive
outcome and if it's just used for
something that is unknown on how well
it's GNA do then it feels like a tax
versus an investment right and so that's
kind of the the trade-off that you got
to think through okay I just had this
idea like you don't know what I would
give Robin to export all your customers
you're like having anxiety just me even

[32:00]
you're like having anxiety just me even
saying that export all your customers or
your customers customers and run a pivot
table of all the industries that your
agency or your SAS preneurs have
customers in and then scrape every
single small business in America 30
million of them and look at the
percentages right like wow okay you know
HVAC is the the most popular home
service but that's only the 17th most
popular home service that our SAS
preneurs have or you know what I'm
saying I would love to see those
inefficiencies because that's going to
tell me I need to launch a marketing
agency in I'm randomly making this up
concrete ceiling because there's a
thousand concrete sealing companies in
the United States and 400 of them are on
High level you know what I'm saying yeah
so we definitely look at that data and
and I'll kind of tell you kind of the
highlights of of what you're saying like
the number one types of businesses that
come into high level from a volume
perspective a percentage are the
independent business owners so think of
like Insurance a agents real estate
agents mortgage you know where they're

[33:01]
agents mortgage you know where they're
solopreneurs in many ways
prosumers yeah you know think of you as
an agency or someone who wants to start
a SAS company or whatever it's very easy
to have a conversation with that person
and like well let me see if I can help
you grow your business now the step
above that after you get into those
independent things is actually fitness
Fitness is actually pretty popular you
know and sorry coming back to the
individual side you know you have real
estate as number one mortgage like so
you have those categories then you get
into fitness and then home services is
is a great one as well and the fun thing
about Home Services you do have kind of
the independent owners but they scale up
so quickly because they end up having to
create a network right like plumber
who's coming in and they pick up a big
job they might be an independent owner
but they need to partner with the
sheetrock guy or the you know the other
framing you know woman who's the expert
in that and then designers and stuff
like that so they have kind of access to
build a big team but they're still an

[34:00]
build a big team but they're still an
independent owner themselves so you can
have that conversation but know that you
know the revenue that they're able to
bring in is actually significant enough
with kind of the smaller the real estate
agent and things like that you know just
as a whole I think there's a lot of
potential for real estate agents but not
every real estate you know a lot of
people get it as a side gig or you know
they don't have a budget I think the
statistic for a lot of real estate
agents is that they will do a half
transaction in their whole yeah lifetime
of doing a a real estate deal and it's
only because it was like a referral
their own property that they were a part
of outside of that they really don't
pursue it it's a great idea it's just a
lot and then they're coming off as a
secondary part-time job not as a
full-time so there's different levels on
that why not basically going to Zillow
to all of their real estate agents and
scrape the ones by number of reviews
right and just presume Whoever has a lot
of reviews they're a high volume agent
I'm going to only target them yeah yeah
th those are the ones that you know
typically have a team themselves they're
willing to spend a little bit more they

[35:01]
willing to spend a little bit more they
understand the value of leads they
understand the value in what you're
trying to do and so I think that's a
great I never thought of you know
scraping things to kind of sort by rank
that way now what about on a percentage
basis because there are two million real
estate agents you know hundreds of
thousands of of mortgage brokers or
attorneys or insurance agents is there
any kind of random Home Service Niche or
local business you know gymnastics
studios art like whatever
that you just kind of keep seeing
anecdotally you're like man those people
are really willing to pay for agency
Services you know definitely the Home
Services space roofers are a big one I
think the tick they've got a budget for
it yeah solar is another one they have a
budget and and it's kind of what we were
talking about earlier right like it's
the they're willing to pay knowing that
the outcome is significant right and so
you know Roofing it's average ticket
size is what I'm sure like 15,000 to
50,000 you know construction remodelers
is a popular one and then yeah in the
home service pool companies plumbers

[36:00]
home service pool companies plumbers
like all home services do extremely well
because you know while they do some
small jobs here in there like the AC
repair person is probably doing small
jobs but what they're really looking for
is when someone needs a replacement $100
service job to now $10,000 project and
so the opportunities just get bigger
over time so high ticket definitely the
way to go yeah finding businesses who
have a high ticket and need a lot of
production to make it meaningful and you
can kind of see that they're doing lot
of production would be the best way for
me to is this a business that I want to
work with Okay so that was the idea for
a year or so ago uh widget a form the AI
answering service what about today is
that changed the only thing that I would
change is just instead of the Mis call
text back changing it's called
Ai and I like that angle a lot better
one is it you know I think it solves a
better use case than just doing a Mis
call textback because what what happens
is in the missc call textback world
someone calls the business the business
doesn't answer and as a consumer when

[37:01]
doesn't answer and as a consumer when
you're searching for a business you go
down the Google listings right the top
three businesses and the first person to
answer is when I stop when I do the Mis
call text back the premise there and
what made it so great is somebody calls
the business no one answers the person
hangs up and they're starting to look at
the next result to call them but all of
a sudden you get the pattern interrupt
you get a text message saying hey sorry
Mr call how can I help you now the
problem there is the person responds
back saying hey my
toilet is overflowing or whatever it is
no one is there to then keep the
conversation going as a small business
doing a job now on The Voice side of it
remember they picked up the phone and
called so now if you have an AI bot and
it's a really good AI bot I mean a lot
of the new AI stuff that we're rolling
out feels like a human I mean it's just
really incredible yeah and it's oh yeah
okay so I let me go ahead and collect
your address let me go ahead and get all
the details so it's a little bit more in
you know the intent is so strong and
then you actually get the outcome right
which is booking the appointment or
saying that I got your address we have

[38:01]
saying that I got your address we have
someone call you back immediately
basically doing that next leg of the the
sales flow and so that's what makes the
AI part so you know so big and like I
said it's also sexy right now have you
heard of any of your of your sass
preneurs launching like a a high level
implementation agency where like let's
say a medium-sized company is spending
four grand a month on HubSpot and they
kind of move in there transfer
everything over train the team is that a
thing that is a a massive thing and
actually internally with my my my team
we're talking about like what are the
different Paths of using high level and
you know kind of in our whole ecosystem
and that is actually one of those
budding economies that we have where
it's like thirdparty Consulting
companies where the whole job is you
know they specialize in migrating things
over creating custom development like
really shaping up the automations how
you're using the tool you know we've
been talking a lot about like you know
the top of funnel right helping people
take leads and how do you get them to
book an appointment but like what these
companies are doing is taking once it

[39:00]
companies are doing is taking once it
gets to a certain stage we needed to
send out an invoice and send out a PDF
and once they sign the PDF we needed to
put it into our other system to model
out what it needs to do from a costing
perspective and then when it we need to
send it back to high level so you can
see you know kind of produce estimate
like just doing all sorts of crazy
operational things and so this is a
crazy market and so what we've been
supported is actually we created a
certified directory so create a
certified program that was my next
question yes you're going to do
something like that yeah so I mean it's
been taken off and it's doing incredibly
well where you need to sign up to it we
want want to have the barrier of Entry
of like someone who's going to take it
seriously it's low cost it's 100 bucks a
month and it's about 30 to 40 hours of
content that you go through to get
trained you take a test and if you pass
that first test you then have to take a
second test that's actually being
proctored by someone at high level so
we're actually watching you on Zoom we
give you a case study and we want to see
you build it because we we don't want
people to just blow through it and get a
fake and then walk around on Main Street
if we're going to put our name behind

[40:01]
if we're going to put our name behind
you we're going to make sure that you're
legit and then from there we actually
put you on a public directory and it
actually you give them customers we give
them leads we give them customers and
the certification is so real that it
expires and so if you're out in the
world say that I'm certified well that
employer can look it up saying oh yeah
you were certified years ago you're not
certified now so you don't know the
newest latest inra technology so it
gives it a lot lot of validation and so
people really like it and yeah that
directory is starting to generate leads
of businesses you know my vision has
always been sales force has grown to
this massive level and done incredibly
well and now just gonna talk about that
certified you know Salesforce developers
and it's now an economy so my goal is
how do I turn our certification program
so that when I go to indeed or jobs.com
people are asking for I need someone
certified in high level and that's a you
know creating massive salary
opportunities and things like that and
so that's we're really time to take it
but right now the Consulting companies

[41:00]
but right now the Consulting companies
is kind of the first level into it and
we're trying to support them with the
certified program people don't realize
there are eight nine plus figure
companies out there that just Implement
Salesforce or Cisco or netsuite or
you're saying like you're getting to
that point where you're starting your
own Marketplace for that right 100% the
world exists that you know that piece of
our economy exists today the amount that
they're commanding and the amount that
they're supporting is just getting
larger and larger that you know these
groups these individuals are certain
make significant amount of of salaries
and and jobs as well as creating massive
agencies in this development
implementation world but then the
businesses that they're supporting it's
not you know sure there's the local
businesses that they're supporting and
stuff like that but now they're getting
into mid-market businesses you know the
hundred million dollar companies the
$500 million billion dollar companies
are also looking for you know these
resources and you know the power of high
level plus the Consulting Group people
don't care about what the technology is
underlying it's about the outcome so if
you can get to the outcome
they're willing to pay for it they don't
care what it's going to take so it's in

[42:01]
care what it's going to take so it's in
the early days of this directory would
you say as of today is there more demand
or more Supply like is there more supply
of these high level certified guys or
more demand from companies looking for
guys like that right now we're at the
perfect balance where there's a good
amount of supply and we're matching up
the Demand right now one of the
challenges on our side is we didn't
realize how fast it was going to take
off and one of the biggest uh
constraints that we have is the live
proctoring so being able to make sure
that we can keep up with that volume
it's just one of the challenges that
we're working through we'll solve it in
the next month or two but I think the
second half of this year that's going to
be one of our big pushes is really
making the certified program a real
thing you know from a public perspective
and there's G to be two one is you can
actually get certified and be in the
marketplace so that you can receive
leads and opportunities and we want to
help you get jobs and opportunities
create businesses that way but then also
it's having the certified program where
you know Chris maybe for one of your
businesses you hire somebody and you

[43:00]
businesses you hire somebody and you
want them to just learn the platform
they can go to the certified program and
maybe they don't need to get tested and
all that you just want to make sure that
they get the right training they go
there to learn yeah exactly and so now
it's how do we evangelize high level for
all the end users and so that that's
really where I want to kind of take the
next stage of that certified program so
if there's someone out there wanting to
already start a marketing agency on High
level is it fair to say that they could
kind of hedge their bets and potentially
get leads from two different places if
they got certified through you and and
listed on your directory like they could
do that maybe get a lead or two every
now and then while they go try to find
their own customers at the same time
yeah definitely the only caveat that I
will say is it's one thing to get the
leads there is the fear of execution
that kind of stop a lot of new
entrepreneurs mostly close it to some
they might close it but then it's they
get into analysis paralysis to making
sure that they set up this perfect thing
and so my thing you know if I was going
to advise anyone is like yes you have
that as your maybe your next phase of
going a certified program and getting
leads that way but just go find the easy

[44:00]
leads that way but just go find the easy
layups and progressively work your way
up because remember it's about the
outcome not about how you build it but I
feel like when you go to the program you
get in your own head the expectations
are so high on execution because the
complex needs and stuff like that do you
have any sass preneurs using paid ads to
just crank crank through new customers
if they don't want to go door too oh oh
yeah I mean I think the challenge is you
know when you're starting up it's the
capital to put up ads but once have
revenue and you know it we see it quite
a bit with a lot of people who come from
traditional marketing agencies who know
how to run Facebook ads know the the
cpls the you know the cat cost how much
to reinvest back in but yeah there's a
ton of people who focus on that and what
they do is they're not trying to sell
the product to anybody and everybody
they try to get hyperfocused with this
with an angle right like I'm taking what
I built within high level I'm going to
specialize it for dentist so now you're
just running ads to go find more
dentists or plumbers or whatever
industry I I did a video on you guys on

[45:02]
industry I I did a video on you guys on
I went to your SAS preneural Awards site
and I just started reverse engineering
these guys making a 100 Grand a month a
million dollars a month and one of them
was like Chiropractic leads for Spanish
speaking chiropractors making like 130
Grand a month massive what yeah and it's
kind of the same thing right like you
actually don't need a lot of customers
to make that Revenue you know you can do
that with 20 30 customers because such a
specialized market and you know in the
Chiropractic space very similar it's
like somebody coming in the treatment
lifetime value of it it's in the
thousands right so if I can help you get
one mostly in the specialized market and
you become the authority into it you
could do incredibly well and yeah I mean
it is so surprising for me and like I
when I started the company with Shan
like we had no idea what we were
building it like from the outcomes so
hearing stories like that like it's just
mindboggling to me and it's like it
lights me up when I hear more of these
stories and how creating these new
economies how much are like your biggest

[46:00]
economies how much are like your biggest
sass preneurs making per month or year
Topline definitely eight figures I mean
I heard one who actually sold which is
awesome in the high eight figures I we
heard one that's getting into the nine
figure range um from an exit perspective
from valuation perspective I should say
I think for even you know you do a lot
of investing um you know it used to be
about so focused on what are the tools
that you're using do you own it and the
IP behind it and stuff I think now you
know investors are looking at does it
have a predictable sales model it's cool
you're using these tools we understand
you know the relationships that you have
to build it and you know and how you're
accomplishing it but really it's we want
to buy the sales model we want to put
more gas into it to sell it so the
valuations is more about that not so
much about the underlying Tech anymore
and so that's why the opportunity is so
right for people to grow it to a decent
size and flip it to the next person
actually one example that I got
individual going after after dentist and
selling it for the dental practices and
he actually approached one dental

[47:01]
he actually approached one dental
practice that was a part of a network of
30 like a DSO yeah exactly and it was I
think one of the dentist or a group of
dentists turned it into essentially a
private Equity Firm and he just picked
up one dentist two dentist three dentist
four dentist and um started making
really good money and then finally you
know upper management you know the
organization was like what what is this
you guys are grow we see the numbers you
guys have grown what do you guys do oh
we're partner with this guy well they
approached him saying we want to buy you
out and then you know now it's they
thought you know their thesis was we can
buy that marketing agency that sasper
software implement it to all 30 and our
business would 10x fold and we don't
have to pay their fee and so he got a
massive exit out of it you know I think
it was like a $6 million exit and he
only had the business for 18 months I
was like wow wow they just walk away and
and that private Equity company will pay
more than anyone else because of the
value it is to them they saw it right
like they saw so and I think it was like
$6 million and then you need to stay on

[48:01]
$6 million and then you need to stay on
for another 12 months to help us
implement it to all three and he
backfilled it so that they were able to
bring it house but they were like the
way that he was explaining it to me was
like they think that they can make $30
million by implementing it in all their
locations plus they're plan on acquiring
more this is just an investment right
it's a no-brainer yeah it's like buying
one more dental clinic that's the crazy
part about you know how interesting the
Dynamics of business is changing and the
opportunities that that's coming up now
I mean I love talking about the concept
of uh finding a white whale right one
big customer that could change your life
and so if I were launching this today I
would probably like people don't know
there are thousands of franchisors out
there thousands of franchisors and
millions of franchises right McDonald's
alone there's 30,000 right I would go
find and most franchisors most people
have never heard of right like a random
mosquito control franchise or in the
northwest with 24 locations you know
there's so many out there like that I

[49:01]
there's so many out there like that I
would go find a franchisee customer
that's part of a small franchise or like
10 to 30 40 locations crush it for them
crush it like the word spreads in the
franchise crush it for someone else and
then get everyone like why would the
franchise or not want to force like
literally force all his franchises to
take them on if it's making all of them
more money therefore making the
franchise or more money now you have 30
customers from One customer right sell
the one to sell the 30 I love that model
and you know one caveat that I would say
is the larger franchises actually are
easier to find the local person who owns
the local franchise you'll hear the
objections of like oh you can't go to a
franchise Network because the franchisor
restricts using third-party companies
and things like that but when you just
have an entrepreneur who's a part of the
franchise they're not hitting the
numbers or whatever you know they're
Scrappy they're like I don't care I
gotta make my business work I'm not
getting the support or it's not working
you're able to get into that

[50:00]
you're able to get into that
conversation everything else just starts
hitting and you actually that white
whale component right sure you have 30
40 but if it's a 200 I've seen a couple
stories like in the fitness space where
someone approached one and it was like
you know just a random location that
wasn't doing well and then that person
had a little bit of a support group of
other people kind of in that same thing
overall the franchise network is great
but the small network of the small ones
that individual picked up 200 locations
out of a
wow and then he got a call from
corporate saying we need to talk in in a
positive way and the fun thing is you
know from a leverage perspective if the
top franchise or says your outs we're
taking over they're pissing off all the
locations right their life's miserable
yeah and so they're basically saying we
we need to partner with you because we
see the positivity and so 100% agree
with your approach I didn't just like
pull that out of thin air I was that was
just one of the many examples I found
reverse engineering your sass preneurs I
found a I don't even remember the
company and if I did I probably wouldn't

[51:00]
company and if I did I probably wouldn't
say them but it was just some guy that
had like an eight-month old highlevel
agency and he was just bragging on
LinkedIn to everyone like hey we just
got our 100th customer our 500th
customer and I'm like what the heck and
then I saw they just had this
partnership with one franchisor and
they're an eight figure company and the
fun thing about it it's like oh like
what I was saying earlier about the
local businesses now it's like almost
close to Heart where it's like oh I'm
working with Chris who owns this
fitness group which happens to be your
fitness group I got success for him so
that Authority level just goes up even
higher so then you just start picking
them off one by one and it be the fun
thing about growing it from a
scalability perspective just becomes
TurnKey you're just doing the same thing
over and over again all the only thing
that you're doing is adjusting it for
that new address yeah everything else
stays the same oh man that's so
beautiful well we're out of time he
probably need to drive home to your
family at this point oh yeah lost track
time is a great conversation yeah this
was awesome thank you for your time
Robin obviously we know where to find
you go high.com when when are you g to

[52:01]
you go high.com when when are you g to
get the high l.com domain name like
surely you've been trying you know
what's funny is we got go high l.com
when we started because you know someone
want a lot of money I've reached out
periodically throughout the years
actually earlier this year I reached out
you know all right it sucks I don't want
to have to do this but I'm will in off
first no response and so you know we're
now leaning into the go High Level side
of things that people just kind of know
us that way even though the official
company is high it's officially high
level but you know we're testing it
around actually on the website right now
we're split testing like if we change it
to go high level and we have a different
version of it with a piece of tape okay
it's like handwritten go on it yeah yeah
testing it out to see if it's gonna help
us from a slit testing perspective but
yeah you know at the end of the day it's
not about us here at high level it's
about your brand I want to see the you
know Chris Corner CRM platform and you
support you with your brand so call us
whatever you want it really doesn't hurt
us at the end of the day I just love it
when I I call you high level because if
you know you know I love it when people
correct me they're like it's go I'm like
no shut up they just wanted to pay $10

[53:00]
no shut up they just wanted to pay $10
for a domain name not 10 million exactly
right but you know like I said it's fine
we go by anything you can just say hey
we love you that that work you don't
need to call me my name gotcha okay well
thank you Robin this was awesome all
right well thank you so much for having
me on all right what you think please
