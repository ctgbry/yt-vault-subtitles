look at this freaking guy right here you
know how much money this thing could
make you for one let's start with Airbnb
airbnbs are super oversaturated at this
point and the only ones that win are the
really unique ones guess what this is
about as unique as you get so if I were
starting another Airbnb right now I
would build exactly this because I
promise you you're going to laugh but I
promise you you could charge $300 to
$600 a night to stay in this thing I bet
you it costs less than 10 grand to build
the second way I would monetize this is
I would get a hold of this guy I have
his contact info and play middleman
between him and airb be owners here in
the states or anywhere he could consult
for people here in the states to build
this thing and I could take a cut of
everything in between I bet you if there
were 50 of these around the world they
would all stay fully booked because it
is instagrammable it is memorable it is
unique and it's freaking awesome full
