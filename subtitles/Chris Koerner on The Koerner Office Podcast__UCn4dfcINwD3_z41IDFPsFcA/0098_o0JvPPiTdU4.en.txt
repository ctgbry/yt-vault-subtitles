this tweet of mine went viral because I
claimed it was possible to pressure wash
a 3,000 ft house in only 20 minutes
people lost their minds so I did what
any prideful person would do I hopped on
an American Airlines flight from Dallas
to Nashville and I got together with two
pressure washers and we live streamed
the pressure washing of a
4,825 ft house in only 22 minutes don't
believe me go to my YouTube channel the
ker office to watch us do it no edits no
you're welcome
