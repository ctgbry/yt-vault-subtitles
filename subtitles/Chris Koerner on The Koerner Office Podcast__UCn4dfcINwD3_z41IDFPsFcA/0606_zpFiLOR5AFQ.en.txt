up how many people are selling this
that's right none now why and how should
you sell this and how can you make money

right here is about $150 this is
literally just flowers and baby oil but

without fragrance it's 15 cents per
ounce on Amazon or 7 cents per ounce
from a bulk distributor these bottles

pay ungodly amounts for flowers that die
in a week so what would they pay for
Gorgeous Flowers that last a year and no
one's selling them get the full business
