here are three ways to make six figures
a year by piggybacking off the Tesla
brand and the third one is the best
number one Tesla exclusive wheel repair
why because Tesla wheels are black so
when you get curb rash it looks terrible
and guess what almost no one is doing
this how do I know because I have a
friend in Kansas City that does this and
he prints money he has a line out the
door every single day number two go to
supercharging stations and offer to wash
the cars they have to spend 30 minutes
there waiting to charge and no one is
selling to them that is a shame you need
to sell to them at the supercharging
stations as there are thousands of them
number three cybertruck only wrapping
why because cyber trucks are ugly they
are only one color and people want them
wrapped and they are easy to wrap
because they have straight edges order
the wraps yourself for hundreds of
dollars and do the service for thousands
of dollars I'm going to do three more
Tesla piggyback ideas tomorrow so follow
me for
