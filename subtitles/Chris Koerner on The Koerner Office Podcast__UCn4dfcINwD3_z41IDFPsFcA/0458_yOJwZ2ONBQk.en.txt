look at this freaking thing right here
before I tell you what's going on here I
want to tell you how I find amazing
business ideas like this and what
framework I use to think of your own
cool business ideas like this this is
day seven of showing you my favorite
business ideas for 2025 so follow for
more I start by going to Google Trends
outs scraper gummy surch and Reddit and
I'm going to put all these in a list
later and the internet will tell me what
types of products or services are
popping off right now this is a
Blackstone grill men are freaky about
their Blackstone grills myself included
same to be said with big green eggs uni
or gny pizza ovens yada y y so what's
the framework find these products that
have cult followings and amazing Brands
Trager pellet girls for example and
build other products or services around
those Brands look at this thing it's a
Blackstone Grill on Wheels and I don't
even know what's going on but this cost
thousands of dollars and people will pay
for it and any tinkerer can make this in
their garage you could do a dozen
different products just for the
Blackstone or for the uni or for the
gazy or for the Trager or for the Big
Green Egg it could be for anything you
just have to have a maniacal fan base I
put everything in the list right here I
have nothing to sell you
