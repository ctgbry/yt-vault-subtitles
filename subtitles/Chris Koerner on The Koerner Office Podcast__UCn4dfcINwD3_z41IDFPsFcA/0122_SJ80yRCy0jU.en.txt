but I got two business ideas for you
one's practical one's not the first one
walk around a neighborhood just like
this one with a leaf blower knock on
every door and say hey for 100 bucks
I'll blow out all of the gutters in your
house why not give it a shot the second
idea of fast casual potato chip
restaurant concept kind of like Chipotle
but for potato chips you walk in they
make them fresh they're hot you can bag
them you can eat them on site so on my
podcast I roast business ideas for a
living I roasted nine on episodes 32 of
the ker office that's at TKO pod.com if
you like it you can go copy that
business idea and start it for yourself
if you don't then you can make fun of me
to all your friends follow me for more
