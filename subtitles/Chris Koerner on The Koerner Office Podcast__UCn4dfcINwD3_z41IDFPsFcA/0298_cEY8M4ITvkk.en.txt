this is a freaking genius business idea
that you could start tomorrow and in 52
seconds I'll tell you how to scale it to
2500 bucks a day for about $100 so this
guy just commented on my post he owns a
moving company and when business is slow
they go troll Facebook Marketplace for
free posos and then offer to charge $250
to pick it up why would anyone pay that
I'll tell you exactly why but before I
do here are some numbers I live in
Dallas Texas within 40 Mi of me every
single day 50 to 60 free posos are
listed over the last 24 hours there have
been 54 10 to 20% of those will be
claimed 80 to 90% of those will never be
claimed because there are so many and
they're freaking heavy and who wants to
go get them and then they have to be
tuned but guess what these people still
need them gone so here's what you do
start messaging all these people offer
them 150 to 350 to pick up the piano to
line them all up for the same day go
rent a U-Haul for $39.99 plus 95 per
mile you and a friend go pick them up
roll them up the ramp deliver them to
the dump you do 10 of those a day and
that's 2500 bucks a day
