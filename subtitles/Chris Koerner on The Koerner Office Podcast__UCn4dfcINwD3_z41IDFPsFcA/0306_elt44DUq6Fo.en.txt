so these two best friends make 250 bucks
an hour doing a home service business
that I promise you've never heard of
here's exactly what they're doing and
exactly how you can copy them so one
summer while home from college they were
helping a neighbor install a deck for
$15 an hour when another neighbor came
out and said hey can you clean my Lake
weeds they're like Lake weeds yeah we
can do that so they charged 25 bucks an
hour and by the end of the day they had
dozens of neighbors begging to clean
their Lake weeds as well so they went to
Home Depot bought a couple lawn rakes
jumped in the lake and started raking
them up and putting them up on the bank
by the end of that summer they made over
10 grand and then the next summer they
profited over 30 Grand in 3 months 75%
net margins and now they charge 250 an
hour and Outsource all the work and
every pond in Lake needs this service no
one else is doing this and the craziest
thing is all the details about what they
did are right here
