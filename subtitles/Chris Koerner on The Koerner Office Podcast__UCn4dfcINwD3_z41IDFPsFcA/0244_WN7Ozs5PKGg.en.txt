so if you're not content with your life
right now then these 42 seconds will
serve you well that's me in the tan
right there I was a guard for the
Tuscaloosa County Jail I got paid 1450
hour but I had health insurance benefits
which was key because my wife was
pregnant with our first kid and we
didn't have health insurance so I'd work
all night 36 to 48 hours per week go
home and sleep for 5 hours go to classes
at the University of Alabama and then
I'd wait tables on the nights I wasn't
working at the jail I hated my life I
was guarding inmates booking them in
fingerprints getting in fights it's not
me at all I'm not confrontational but
sometimes you just got to eat crap for a
while so you can have the life that
you're hoping to have so if you've been
in a job that you hate or relationship
or a life that you hate just keep
progressing keep getting through that
and compounding will work its magic and
you will get out of it the whole key is
that you don't quit don't interrupt
compounding just keep learning these
lessons and getting through the crappy
parts and you'll get to the good parts
