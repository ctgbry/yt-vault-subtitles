[00:00]
all right so over the weekend I saw this
video that I could not get out of my
head it was a ship container on the back
of a semi TR with big huge Windows cut
out of the side of it and 40 people
drinking wine dancing hanging out having
fun driving across the California
Countryside and it just broke my frame
broke the mold for what safety should
look like it was a viral video and all
of the comments said there's no way this
is safe you're going to get sued this is
so dumb you're so dumb and I'm like okay
I'm on to something here so I quickly
pulled out my phone recorded my thoughts
on it left that video on in the
background posted it few days later it
had over 20 million views across
platforms this business is called
toasted tours it was started by this guy
named Kevin Thro that I just interviewed
he's amazing he spent years at Tesla
doing Fleet Sales for them to companies
like Herz and Alamo and then he got laid
off unexpectedly and then he took a
couple odd jobs until he decided I'm
never going to let my fate be decided by
an employer ever again and so he took
his life savings it's like 65 Grand

[01:01]
his life savings it's like 65 Grand
bought an ugly School Bus for three
grand spent a year renovating this thing
himself and he just knew if I make
something amazing awesome beautiful they
will come people will come the product
will sell itself he took a ton of
learnings from Elon Musk and Tesla
because they don't do any marketing and
design and providing a great experience
and he poured that into toasted tours
and now he's making a lot of money doing
something awesome and videos of his tour
buses routinely go viral because it look
looks crazy it looks crazy that this
thing is legal in California of all
places but it is he's making great money
we talk about insurance costs unit
economics growth marketing first
principles why you should do hard things
why you should tackle big problems why
you should break all the rules you're
going to love this please share it with
a friend I promise you're going to see
these trailer buses all over the country
and it's all going to be because of
Kevin through
[Music]
enjoy okay so how long had this idea
been your head and what gave you the

[02:01]
been your head and what gave you the
idea I got my master's degree or my MBA
from a decent School in business I had
Tesla on my resume and I thought I want
to do corporate I want to do business
and then after kind of taking a look and
and getting the inside view especially
with a company like Tesla of the
corporate world I said this is just not
for me I want to succeed or fail on my
own terms it's okay if I fail but I
don't want to fail because of something
that's out of my control and so I just
got to a point where you know and it was
it was pressure on like my marriage and
and you know even in my family a little
bit where I just said I don't care if I
live in a cardboard box I'm done working
for someone else I'm starting over and I
just don't care what I have to do so so
basically as soon as that happened I
said well what are my options you know
the shortest distance between two points
is a straight line what's my straight
line to a viable business where you know
I can feed my family necessity is the

[03:00]
I can feed my family necessity is the
mother of invention and where were you
living at the time we were living in
Tula yeah Okay cool so the first thing
that came to mind is hey something kind
of service-based you know we live in
wine country I wonder if I could do Wine
Tours if I did that how could I start at
this point you know I've drained most of
my savings and everything so I'm a
missionary kid there's no one in my
family with money I can't beg or borrow
same yeah
so basically I have to start with the
bare minimum school buses so I'm looking
around if I did a tour how could I do it
school buses are reliable there's a lot
of them on the market and the old ones
you know I bought mine for 3,000 bucks
didn't even look at it first bought it
on eBay three grand went and picked it
up later did you drive it home yeah I
drove her home yeah okay from where not
far Escondido so okay yeah like 30

[04:00]
far Escondido so okay yeah like 30
minutes but these two the two semis that
I have now I drove those from the East
Coast that was a fun time oh wow yeah so
with the bus basically took it home and
then my angle was going to be I'll you
know to try to I was going to put
lipstick on a pig basically MH you know
was my business models is always my joke
it's lipstick on a pig how do I make it
cute and desirable for someone to want
to do a tour in it let's and upfit it
couldn't pay for anyone to do it so I
did it myself I needed to spend an
enormous amount of time on it so I live
in a track home and I had it parked in
front of my house on the street and I my
neighbor started calling I started
getting tickets and so it got to a point
where I was like you know what fine but
I can't I don't really have anywhere to
take it or I can work on it and I was
working like 16 hours a day on this
thing I suck with hammer and nail and
and screw dryer and everything else

[05:00]
and screw dryer and everything else
where I did at the time now I'm pretty
handy but I was putting a ton of time
into it and so I ended up basically in
this track home pulling it alongside my
house I was 2 inches away from my fence
and like an inch away from my house and
covered it up with solar sails so that
my HOA wouldn't see what I was doing and
I'm basically I have this like hidden
school bus in this track home that I'm
desperately trying to hide from my
neighbors and and the HOA and basically
built it out there uh and it went really
well now how much money did you put into
it after that first three grand I only
should have put in about 30 Grand at the
most if I'm being honest but because I'm
so
terrible with you know being handy or I
was at the time I probably put in double
that because I you know I had to do the
floors three times I had to do the
electrical three times I had to do you
know all of it it because I'm learning

[06:01]
know all of it it because I'm learning
as I go you are a masochist you're right
I am a masochist so yeah because I did
everything multiple times ended up
probably coming out to about 60 total
for the whole thing geez okay so let's
call it 65 for the bus and all that how
many months did it take you to make
these Renovations it took me about a
year on the bus okay solid 12 months
that one was really nice cuz I put in
about that amount of money and then as
soon as I got onto the market you know
know it was doing about 250 in Revenue
to 300 a year consistently probably
about 300 a year consistently yeah for
and I had no more overhead I'd already
sunk the money in my labor and you know
the materials that I bought but
fortunately Co hit but I was so I had
just no money so I just remember when
they sent out the stimulus checks and I
got unemployment checks I was waiting

[07:00]
got unemployment checks I was waiting
for my dispersement of the covid
stimulus stuff and my unemployment
checks and as soon as I got them it
ticked my wife off to no when but I
headed down to Home Depot and just
bought all the supplies to build that
bus so I mean I really bootstrapped the
heck out of that thing so before we get
into your first year which I'm super
curious about why Wine Tours like
obviously you live in Wine Country you
see it it's familiar to you but there's
got to be something else about it that
just spoke to you like what is is it
about yourself your your background your
history that made this business idea
stand out to you it was a crime of
opportunity so we're already here it's
service-based
meaning there's not you can just jump
right into it and you're you're
contributing value by your service and I
wanted to make it a little more
defensible by having you know
differentiation with the type of vehicle
that I was bringing out there you know
on the back end it was really practical

[08:01]
on the back end it was really practical
because it was extremely cheap to buy
and build and then on the front end on
the marketing side you know it's cute
for lack of a better word what were your
competitors doing what types of vehicles
or did they use I play too much offense
and not enough defense but I basically
didn't even pay attention to what my
competitors were doing I think I took
you know a grand total of like 30
minutes of looking what the market was
doing it did occur to me that the you
know immediately out in Wine Country
you'll see all these you know these
blacked out buses that look like they
belong in Hollywood at you know 1:00
a.m. on a Saturday night they got the
flashing lights it looks like a disco in
there I thought this is just almost
embarrassing this is terrible people are
out here to see Wine Country they don't
want to be stuck in this stuck in this
like claustrophobic blacked out limo so
as soon as I saw that and that there
really wasn't anything similar being
done I was like well at the very least

[09:01]
done I was like well at the very least
I'll be different and that'll make me
stand out for a start and it's not going
to be as ugly on the interior as all the
ones that are out there so it was just
easy yeah how did your pricing compare
to the big fancy buses I don't set the
price the market sets the price right so
depending on what kind of demand I get
if I have too much demand I'll up the
price if I have too little demand I'll
drop the price and then wherever I land
that's you know that's your your point
on your X and Y AIS so basic economics
right yeah okay so how did you find
those first customers Instagram and word
of mouth so this was like 2019 2020 when
you first launched Okay cool so so you
just created an Instagram account and
you start posting I created an Instagram
account and I just started posting can't
recall if I even had a website yet I
think I just said hey if you want a tour
contact me let's do it at some point
pretty early on I got a website I'm just

[10:00]
pretty early on I got a website I'm just
setting up the basics and people started
contacting me and I knew that because I
don't have a lot of you know visibility
out there I'm knew some people wouldn't
kind of trust me but I knew there'd be a
subset of the general population that
wouldn't look too closely they say this
looks cute let's do it and that's what
happened and then it just I basically
had zero problems with demand ever since
did you have any social media skills or
anything because I think a lot of people
are listening like oh you just create an
Instagram account and you start posting
like was there anything more to it or
like did you get all your friends and
family did you tell all the people in
your your sphere of influence or I
probably should have gotten more help
than I did well clearly not I mean
you're doing great yeah I created an
Instagram account and my focus was on
visually making it look convincing I
wanted someone who is looking at it kind
of with a cursory overview very quickly
from the Aesthetics of the Instagram

[11:03]
from the Aesthetics of the Instagram
account you know there are certain
standards with like with design graphic
design and that kind of a thing that
make it look like you know what you're
doing it's much easier now than even
when I did it you know I think I just
jumped on I used canva but they already
have a lot of those really abstract
design methodologies built into it so
you can take their template and you just
try TR not to vary too much from that
template but I think I had enough of a
feel that I was able to get away with it
I was also really open and upfront with
the kind of the story of it this is
something that I did I'm trying to start
a business built this out we hope you
guys will like it and trust us as we
start out and support us as a brand new
business and people are sympathetic to
that if you're you know I'm a big
believer in honesty and authenticity I
got nothing to hide I'll try to convince

[12:01]
got nothing to hide I'll try to convince
you that I look like I know what I'm
doing like I said with the with the
graphic design and everything but I
don't mind telling you exactly where I'm
at in the process especially you know
even if I'm at the beginning I don't
know if you were cognizant of this at
the time but the more I kind of tie this
together the more what you did with
toasted Tes reminds me of Tesla like
Tesla they don't do any formal marketing
they're selling an amazing product and
the experience that that product
provides I'm a huge Tesla fanboy mod S I
bought it the the second I could afford
it so I'm totally with you on that and
like they don't mark it they don't do
anything they just have a beautiful
product and the pictures of the product
sell themselves and on one hand it's
like you hear that and you're like oh it
sells itself and it's like okay come on
and on the other hand it's like when it
actually does it actually does it kind
of sells itself so is that kind of did
you take your learnings from Tesla and
kind of put it into this without even
realizing it or did you realize it yeah
I think there was like I took a lot of
lessons from Tesla one of the things I
remember the most with Elon is I don't

[13:01]
remember the most with Elon is I don't
do Partnerships because I don't dilute
the brand and that kind of stuck with me
I understood what he's talking about you
know Tesla hard times in the beginning
and then when we first came out and
started being really successful
everybody wanted a piece right even the
clients that we really wanted like Herz
or you know Enterprise they wanted deals
on our cars they wanted to get big cuts
because they're the big guys and Elon
basically said nope they got it what
what you have to do in sales is you have
to convince them that it's worth buying
at the price that we have offered and
that they're going to pay the same price
as I'm going to pay and the general
public is going to pay so that really
stuck with me and and I definitely saw
that like when you focus on bringing
value and making the best thing that you
can the market comes on its own and then
randomly
It's actually an an analogy for General

[14:03]
It's actually an an analogy for General
general relativity of all things like in
physics but someone was trying to
explain you know the relativity of of
time and they basically said if you have
a big
trampoline and you put a bowling ball or
you throw you know a box of pennies on
the trampoline I'm explaining it now in
the way that I'm seeing it but with the
original analogy basically the bowling
ball weighs down the trampoline in the
center and the the fabric of the
trampoline is kind of a fabric of space
and time and then anything starts
rolling towards the bowling ball yeah
yeah you know in time so that stuck with
me from a different angle which was
basically
marketing so in my head I'm thinking
look if you if you create a product
that's really heavy and has a lot of
impact and then you have this box of of
pennies to represent customers and you
scatter the pennies all over the

[15:00]
scatter the pennies all over the
trampoline you're trying to get them to
you're trying to get the pennies to come
to you the easiest way is not to go and
Chase the pennies down it's to have this
great product that kind of sink middle
heavier bowling ball a heavier bowling
ball more impact exactly and then they
and then the pennies are going to come
to you so a lot of people are like okay
how am I going to Market how am I going
to attract people to come to my business
how am I going to you know get those
first initial customers this that and
the other thing and to me I honestly did
not think about it at all I just thought
let me make something that I would want
if I were a customer and they will Find
meh eventually they'll find me and it'll
pick up you know pick up speed and
that's it seems to work did you take any
inspiration from like Instagram accounts
or Airbnb properties that did really
well like where is it where did you get
your design skills and is it the
schoolie that I'm looking at was that
your first school bus
yeah that was the first one okay I have

[16:02]
yeah that was the first one okay I have
very little design skills to speak of
but I will say that another another
lesson I took from Tesla is the
importance of design beauty is a
universal language and if someone sees
something beautiful it's magnetic you
know and of course that's the big lesson
with apple in the early days so we're
talking basic lessons by now that
everyone knows from Apple and from Tesla
so I knew that I wanted to try to make
something that was aesthetically
appealing and that would be the poll we
looked around and we we found someone
who would help to set that up and try to
make it visually appealing and she she
did a fantastic job her name is Erica
and yeah we were her first client tiny
Lane interiors and she did a she did a
great job and I love her for it can't
thank her enough so what did you use for

[17:01]
thank her enough so what did you use for
like your first booking software or you
just had an Instagram account how were
you taking payments was it venmo like
what did the logistics look like that
first year yeah so basically I I just
started with vinmo and I think okay my
first customers I may have gone as you
know caveman enough to just write down a
contract on paper and say can't remember
what it was but we're doing the tour
sign here you're G me money and here's a
paper receipt I mean it was that it was
that old school so one thing I learned
in business school is like you can write
a contract on the back of a napkin in a
restaurant and it's legally valid it
doesn't have to be beautiful so in the
beginning I didn't overthink it very
much I'm like this is a binding contract
they're giving me money I'm taking them
out that was about it and then I think I
picked square space kind of as my
platform haven't changed it yet because
hasn't been that high on the priority
list
and what was what were you charging that

[18:02]
and what was what were you charging that
first year and how many people to a bus
how many tours per day I'm curious about
all that in the very beginning I think I
started at 139 or 149 per person eight
people
minimum 20 people maximum and you were
the driver yeah I was a driver okay yeah
so they got my licensing you know and
how long did the tours last we did four
to five hour tour okay and then on
Saturdays basically I was barely able to
squeeze it Saturdays is where we made
most of our money because you had to get
a group of people together and on a week
dat it's just not really going to happen
so in order to basically turn one bus
into two on Saturdays we did two tours
we still do that or we we actually we do
something slightly different but
basically we did two tours 10:30 to 2:30
3:30 to 7:30 and then we could get two
in one day and that worked out well okay
so call it between 1300 and like 3,000
per day depending on how full the bus is

[19:02]
per day depending on how full the bus is
that's if you had one tour that day and
then twice that on a Saturday at least
that first year yeah I and I was doing
two on Fridays in that first year it was
usually two on Friday two on Saturday
one on Sunday two on Friday two on
Saturday one on Sunday and then one
during the week as well or only week it
would be intermittent during the week we
would get some during the week but just
based on demand yeah hit or miss you
just leave yourself open and see how it
goes yeah pretty much now what all is
included are you including food and wine
in that yeah so the way the the industry
usually does it is they include kind of
the tasting tickets so technically we're
like brokering them and then we can make
a little bit of a margin there the
better rate we get for the wineries
obviously the more we get to keep so we
broker that so you're basically paying
for wine Plus transportation and then
the beginning I included food as well
automatic
so it's like sandwiches and I just built

[20:00]
so it's like sandwiches and I just built
that into my margin so you still have to
buy I didn't know if like this was kind
of like a marketing effort from the
winery and they pay you or the Wine's
free or you're paying for the wine
basically pay for the wine or or the
winery charges us based on how many
guests that we have okay we bring the
guest in the winery serves them and then
the winery basically charges our account
gotcha okay I guess I forgot that Minor
Detail the fact that you're stopping at
different wineries along the way you're
not just driving around looking at Wine
Country yeah yeah three wineries three
wineries okay and that's been like
standard from day one three and four
hours or so so video is cool but you
know what's better long form audio via
podcast and my newsletter TKO pod.com go
there to subscribe for free to my
newsletter it's one email a week very
tactical and then go to my audio podcast
three episodes a week stuff like this
you're going to love it all free no
sleazy sales TKO pod.com there's a
real art to manage managing your risk
when alcohol is involved and so that was

[21:03]
when alcohol is involved and so that was
one of the reasons I included food but
you know human beings are in some ways
kind of Dependable machines so even the
spacing of our wineries how far they are
are apart how long we stay at each
Winery whether they have food or not and
then of course our polic is like no hard
alcohol ever it we're able to keep
people having a great time but not
getting to the point where they're sick
or dangerous so it's actually kind of
neat how we can keep it pretty
predictable controlling variables like
that now did you have any any horror
stories from that first year before you
were able to learn how to control that
variable no issues with guests so I
always kind of make the joke I'm like my
favorite human being is not a zero glass
of wine human being and it's not a five
glass of wine human being it's about a

[22:00]
glass of wine human being it's about a
two glass of wine human being I love
people when they're two glasses of wine
in they can hold a conversation really
well they're coherent and they're
friendly you know versus you know to
this day anyone that gets on a tour
right at the beginning nine times out of
10 they're very stiff a little bit cold
you know and alcohol gets a lot you it's
maligned quite a bit for health and
everything but I'm like I think we would
just be much biger
if we didn't have alcohol to smooth
things over from time to time well
that's that's one way we differ I've
never even tasted alcohol so I'll I'll
have to take your word on that ah T
Toler that's right that's right right on
good for you my man thanks okay so I
want to get into the shipping containers
and like the insurance stuff in a minute
but be before like how hard was it to
find insurance that first year for the
school bus and what were those costs
like those pretty hard and it's
basically had to go with one of these
old
archaic like ancient style insurance

[23:03]
archaic like ancient style insurance
companies and I think I paid 40 grand
for insurance that first year okay on
the bus a which was was pretty darn High
plus they charge interest if you can't
pay the whole thing up front which I had
to pay so yep now is that just on the
bus or the business and the bus you
basically have to carry $5
million of general liability insurance
when you have when you're operating a uh
passenger vehicle that has 15 or more
capacity which was pretty tough on me
because I had no idea that was the case
when I started and I basically went over
the number by by one yeah so I'm paying
maximum Chang that like retroactively
was there any way to fix that
retroactively no they basically said no
there's no way to do it but that was
definitely a consideration I mean there

[24:00]
definitely a consideration I mean there
was there were a lot of things that went
into the semi but definitely one of
those things was hey look if I'm going
to pay astronomical insurance and let's
go as big as we can go yeah it's 16 or
over there's no top end on it so I'm
like all right well then we'll bit as
many people on a bus as possible okay so
40,000 for that first year which is a
ton but still workable right that that
ended up being close to 10% of your
Topline Revenue how did your margins end
up shaking out that first year compared
to what you expected so I wasn't sure
where the cost would be at but again on
the economic side I knew that I was in
the ballpark I didn't know you know I'm
not going to quibble over plus or minus
10% it was going to land where it landed
ended up basically being able to do my
my variable overhead was you know
something like $32 a person after my
fixed costs everything else I was able
to pocket and then you know a lot of

[25:02]
to pocket and then you know a lot of
times people are pretty are pretty
generous so I would get tipped since I
was the driver I would get tipped more
than my cost per person yeah for the
variable cost so you know it was it was
good it worked out perfectly so their
tips just happens to like pay all the
wineries and then some and then you're
just out of pocket for gas and insurance
basically pretty much yeah that's
amazing yeah it worked out really well
how many miles do you cover on a tour I
think it's 18 oh wow holy cow that's not
bad at all and is it mostly kind of like
country roads like 40 50 miles per hour
now with the semi even slower than that
but yeah Country Roads 40 to 50 I mean
it part of the attraction is you're you
want to see Wine Country and at least
for me especially you know it was quite
a compliment but a lot of times my
customers were like we want get some
wine and hang out on the bus all day to

[26:01]
wine and hang out on the bus all day to
drive us around you know I all these
these con requests constantly just let's
get some wine let's just drive around
and I'm like well that's wonderful thank
I'm glad you love it but you know
basically you're already paid for it
these wineries let's go check it out
yeah do do you think there could be
something there just driving people
around or is that not really a big
opportunity they definitely could be but
you only have so many hours right per
day so it would probably be at the
expense of what you're currently doing
you know at least for me there's other
there's other opportunities that make a
ton more sense there wasn't much of a
sightseen component to up here in Tula
there was but it wasn't quite as much
the the brewery tour that I do once a
month in San Diego now with the semi is
almost entirely a sightseeing route and
that is an excellent tour of the
highlights of San Diego and so even on
its own without all the other elements
I think there would be people that would

[27:00]
I think there would be people that would
would want to do that it's it's
beautiful yeah okay so let's talk about
your semi so how did you go from just a
bus to a semi and how long did that take
what did what did business look like
years two to five the calculus for the
for the semi was it was less out of
desperation and it was my opportunity to
expand and do something that felt more
like me the bus was was yeah almost an
emergency so with with that being
successful basically I had the luxury of
sitting back and saying okay what's next
and so I had the option of of doing
let's say multiple buses the one that I
had that was great and it was successful
and I knew I could make a ton of money
off of it I could either do multiple of
those or I could kind of change it up
and do something different and maybe do
one more instead of multiple that was
bigger and a ton of people who I like
and respect told me hey look you already

[28:01]
and respect told me hey look you already
proved with your with your schoolie
that's really successful look at the
profit margins that you have just do
that a bajillion times and I could have
but but you're a masochist yeah but I'm
a masochist you just wanted to keep
growing like growing in your way like
growing like you wanted a new challenge
not just to copy and paste your school
bus that's exactly right yeah even
though I knew there was a risk of you
know failing I just needed something
that that I loved so thinking through
that I thought all right well we already
mentioned the insurance thing you can go
big there and that kind of reduces the
relative cost of your insurance one
thing with the schoolie that was a
concern was that if that engine goes out
I'm super vulnerable so I have a lot of
risk there it's my only Revenue stream I
can't go from bringing home money every
month to bringing home no money every
month because I have a mechanical
problem so I felt there was some risk
there wanted to mitigate that I needed

[29:01]
there wanted to mitigate that I needed
to do something that was really unique
and I thought okay what's the biggest
platform that I can have for
transporting people that I can make
unique and that I can make somewhat
attractive on the inside so you know
there there are other companies out here
that basically run really nice gry Hound
buses so like grapeline which is a
fantastic company they're excellent they
take good care of their employees the
owners are incredible amazing people
they're wonderful but they basically all
you have is transportation and nothing
really unique about it whatsoever but
they can take large groups and my
thought was that's not good enough I
need differentiation so you know also
another lesson I learned both from
school and from Tesla is whatever you
are be different no matter what just be

[30:00]
are be different no matter what just be
different and so I thought well it would
be amazing if you you know the biggest
platform that there is for
transportation is you know semi- trcks
18-wheelers but nobody out there is
doing
that so you know I think that's that is
the point where maybe the way the way
that I think kind of came through I do
think most people would say no can't do
it 18 wheelers no one's taking
people in the back of that let me you
know it's dangerous it's all the things
that I've been accused of whatever
recently there was a post that went out
around the same time that you did a post
that was you know I think about the same
numbers like six million people were on
there but it was a really
unflattering you know view of the semi
going down the road I'm going 35 miles
an hour and it looks like I'm a race car
I don't know why something about the
perspective they sped it up or something
yeah I don't I I don't know why it looks
so fast but even I looked at that video

[31:00]
so fast but even I looked at that video
and I was like terrifying but I'm like a
snail in actuality yeah but like there's
a million reasons when you know as I'm
thinking of that I think 90 95% of
people would immediately dismiss it
because you know human beings were using
you know heris to make decisions because
it's fast but it's like I just think it
would have been rejected out of hand by
most people but you know I'm a big
believer in in like first principles
type thinking and breaking a problem
down you know the Socratic method really
really be careful about the way that you
think as reasoning by analogy is is not
it's not going to make you very
successful really so the most important
question was well why not why can't why
can't I take people in the back of a
semi my first thought was safety so I
basically did some research I looked up
the numbers and I said okay I wanted to
find out is this platform more dangerous

[32:00]
find out is this platform more dangerous
than a normal bus and at first I was
quite alarmed because if you if you pull
up the notes or you pull up you know
like a quick answer 18- wheelers are
involved with a lot more fatalities on
average than regular vehicles but
fortunately I thought to myself okay why
why is that the case it could be because
the people who are not in the semi truck
are are the ones dying which is terrible
to say well that's the truth isn't it it
it's the truth so it turns out that's
why you know you're very and and semi-
trucks in general get into less
collisions so from that perspective it's
not unsafe at all and then basically
going through every other potential area
of exposure so I think okay what could
go wrong here what's the risk think
about that question from first principal
thinking and then decide if it really is
dangerous if it really is viable and
from what I could tell you know this

[33:00]
from what I could tell you know this
platform is extremely reliable companies
have put billions of dollars into
developing this really
sophisticated platform with all kinds of
safety measures built in this is viable
from from that perspective and then my
next two questions
were can I get it done
legally and can I get it insured and
when you say platform you mean what the
ship container is sitting on like the
trailer yeah so sorry when I say
platform what I'm really saying is it's
technically a trailer bus so under like
California vehicle code something
something something they'll Define a
trailer bus in legal terms and that's
what my vehicle is it's a trailer bus
trailer bus okay what was the first call
you made to to figure out if this was
legal or not or how you could do it
California Highway Patrol okay yeah so I
I reached out you know I found a contact
don't remember how contacted this lady
her name was Karen Brown thank you Karen

[34:00]
her name was Karen Brown thank you Karen
you're amazing breaking the Karen
stereotypes oh yeah she's this Karen is
incredible and I basically didn't expect
to even get an email back but she she
emailed me back and she took the time
you know I could tell just from the way
that she was copy pasting she took the
time to to look up each individual line
of the law and say okay on seat belts
you're okay you're going to need to have
your fire extinguisher you're going to
have your emergency exits you need to
have these things and basically this big
long email of things that you know I
would have to comply with this this list
of statutes essentially stat statutes
and then at the end of it she says but
yeah this should be legal as long as you
pass inspection and you do it right it's
legal just follow these these you know
these things here so and then I was that
sorry was that one email like the 8020
of getting approved that was one email
just to make sure that it was it was

[35:01]
just to make sure that it was it was
potentially legal I wasn't going to
start on the project until then so as
soon as she said that the next thing I
did was I switched over to the insurance
side I asked my carrier I had to press
him really hard and I just said I need
to know when I finish this are you going
to insure it or are you not I know you
aren't gonna I know it's going to be
expensive I know you don't know where
that's going to land but is it insurable
and after pressing them pretty hard she
came back and she saides you should be
able to ensure this we just don't know
what the cost is what's the closest
corollary to this is there any other
type of a a trailer bus that transports
people like this like what's the predent
for this there's something similar in
Mexico which I didn't know about
sometimes people compare it to Nashville
which I didn't know about and I don't
even know if when I started the project
these things were going I'm not paying
attention on honestly to what other
people are doing at first when I did a

[36:01]
people are doing at first when I did a
quick once over I didn't find anything
eventually towards the backend when I
was getting my final approvals I was
desperate to find a precedent to
basically use as ammo for the CH and the
California the TC Utility Commission to
say look I'm not the first there's a
precedent here I needed to give them a
reason to say we approve this no one
wants I didn't want anyone at those
Regulatory Agencies to have to approve
it and then it's their neck I wanted
them to be able to say it's been done
before so we approved it yeah you were
just like planning for a fight yeah I'm
just trying to think ahead I don't want
anyone to have a reason to reject it so
I did find one example I think it was
the 70s there were these three Mega
buses operated by Orange County
Transportation Authority they were
massive and they brought people in from
outside of LA to work inside of LA and

[37:01]
outside of LA to work inside of LA and
they were super popular super successful
I think they took a ridiculous amount of
people like 80 people a piece but
eventually La got too tight so it
literally wouldn't fit so they retired
the mega buses but it was very
successful for its time and everyone
loved them backing up just a little bit
was the impetus for for going this
trailer bus route now I know it was
about wanting to grow do something
different and hard but aside from that
was it more about I want to get as I
want to squeeze this this orange as much
as I can if I'm going to have to pay
over 15 uh people capacity for this
insurance I might as well go to 40 as
much as I can go was it more about that
or was it more about this is a very
visually appealing product it it'll be
great for marketing people on social
media will freak out because they'll
think it's illegal did you have that
much foresight to know how visually
appealing and how like naturally quote
viral this would be or was it more about
just so I knew that if I could make it
happen pardon my French but people were

[38:01]
happen pardon my French but people were
going to lose it mhm I knew that from
the beginning even if I kind of
butchered the execution a little bit if
I got an 18-wheeler on the market that's
transporting people and it's visible
there's going to be so much talk around
it I don't have to mark it at all which
I don't pretty much so that ended up
being true yeah like I I don't want to
have to go out there and Market myself
and sell
I want everyone to come to me and if I
put something this ridiculous into the
universe I'm going to get plenty of
eyeballs which is exactly what happen
it's the cybertruck it's yeah it's just
Tesla all over again yeah it's amazing
it's almost so obnoxious by Design
exactly it's a feature not a bug yeah
exactly that's exactly it that was
definitely a heavy consideration I said
if I can get it approved I will
definitely get business just for the
novelty alone I'll get all the marketing

[39:00]
novelty alone I'll get all the marketing
I'll get all of that that's done and
then I have all of these reasons um why
it will be better for me on the back end
as a business so I have a backup truck
if you know if my tractor unit the
pulling unit ever breaks I can swap it
in I'm still going I can do all that
it's on a platform that's already kind
of been proven built out and there's a
there's a lot of tractors on the market
they aren't too expensive you know mine
were only like 13 Grand a piece for good
trucks oh wow yep Cali container yeah
California yeah the trailer was way more
expensive California regulatory stuff
they're hard on the emissions and there
was a little bit of risk in that you
could turn around and you know you're
your vehicle is all of a sudden out of
compliance for emission stuff the and
then the are other other considerations
too the amount of people I can get on

[40:01]
too the amount of people I can get on
there and I thought that I'd be able to
prove it was a great platform because
even from a perspective of comfort
there's a there's distance between the
axles so when you're going over bumps
it's good all the extra tires kind of
absorb certain bumps in the road like
poth holes you don't feel as much and
then basically every trailer except for
really old ones are automatically on air
system suspension so on the Comfort side
there's that and there there's a lot of
other reasons too why I thought the
trailer bus uh was great even on the
safety side when I did my initial like
analysis I decided I think this is a
safer platform if you manage your speed
and you manage the distance between
yourself and the vehicles in front of
you very well this is actually in my
opinion a safety platform largely due to

[41:00]
opinion a safety platform largely due to
the mass of the vehicle yeah yeah if you
get hit it's going to have to be a
pretty big vehicle going pretty fast for
you to even Flinch you got to be hit by
another semi you know what I mean yeah
yeah just all kinds of thinking went
into it the biggest reason I did the
semi if I'm being perfectly honest was
not even all those things it was
about kind of sticking to
my
principles and doing something that was
true to my style of thinking and proving
to myself that I'm not crazy I just
sound crazy you know but I'm actually
very cogent in in the way that I
approach life and that I can do it I
needed to prove it to myself that I
could start from basically zero and I
could build something that I led that
was a reflection of me and that was
really successful so so like I said at
the beginning the business even the semi

[42:02]
the beginning the business even the semi
which is a fun idea and aw awesome you
know platform is just an afterthought of
kind of a process of personal growth for
me what did everything cost all in on
that on that bus on the semi yeah and
the trailer ship container and all that
also had a lot of trouble with um the
building on the container did everything
myself again of course I don't think I'm
going to do that anymore I'm going to
hire someone to build out my stuff from
now on now that I'm now I'm there I'm
I'm a tired man I got welding burn marks
all over body my body I had like Shard
of metal in my metal in my eye and
probably probably about 140 to be honest
okay and then how much did that change
your business do do you have one of
those or two like do you just have that
in the bus or how many vehicles do you
have total yeah for now yeah okay so
yeah of course we'll expand and
everything but yeah for now when did you

[43:01]
everything but yeah for now when did you
know that this was a hit like this was a
certified Banger as soon as I got my
final license number approved from the
TCP it didn't matter that I hadn't
publicized it yet I hadn't shown it to
the market yet it didn't matter as soon
as I got my licensing honestly I you
know the process of getting the
licensing I lined everything up so that
it was legal you know I crossed my teeth
thought of my eyes I went over
everything add nauseum with another CHP
guy who was just incredible this an
amazing organization I it's amazing and
despite that I knew that because of how
extreme the platform was it could get
political it could get to the desk of
some obstructionist in in the government
of which there are many and they could
just say they could find a reason it
didn't matter what it was to shut me
down so you know I built it myself over

[44:03]
down so you know I built it myself over
two years just did everything myself
over two years and that whole time was
just one long period of anxiety and I've
done my thinking but is it going to work
am I going to get to the very end of the
finish line and you know some bureaucrat
is going to say there's no way I prove
this so you know I I can't even
articulate how tough that was but
basically and it went to the desk of the
people at the very top of CHP apparently
the dude that runs the whole
organization and potentially the the
person that runs that unit of the TCP as
well it was on their desk you know and
they had they had all of my work in
their hands my livelihood everything and
I was just like you know please God let
it let them say okay he's met the
requirements let's pass him and I did so
the so you know I remember distinctly
I'm out working at the location where I

[45:01]
I'm out working at the location where I
work on the vehicle and I saw that email
come in and I got the approval and you
know it's like making me emotional even
right now but I remember going I had a
shipping container that I used to store
my tools and stuff and I just wanted
some privacy and I just went inside my
shipping container and just for 20
minutes I just I just cried I knew I'd
made it yeah and from that point it
didn't really matter how I landed on the
market how quickly I sped up how many
customers I had right off the bat it
didn't matter I knew it would be
successful and it has been yeah so how
did you first get the word out about
this and how did that go oh I I just
posted it on my social media obviously
customers come on ask them hey
everyone's taking photos everyone's
taking videos so I said hey please tag
us that's it please tag us and then it's
it's an exponential effect so again I

[46:01]
it's an exponential effect so again I
wasn't too worried about that the one
random thing that is extremely difficult
is that for the life of me I I it's hard
to get the right footage for this thing
you did a great job on your video kind
of piecing together what was available
for footage and like that other video
it's just a terrible video and then we
had a third video that went viral a
while back I don't know five million
views or something six million views
about the same
and it's the worst shot I've ever
seen just absolutely terrible it's like
horizontal and she she wrote over it and
blocked the whole thing and well that's
why they go viral right maybe stop
trying to make nice videos apparently
capturing the right type of videos that
will do well I can't seem to do so I
probably see seven or eight people
filming me as I drive by every single
day seven or eight people for sure wow
and nobody sends me anything so if
there's anyone out there who video of me
driving down the street for God's sake
please send it to me cuz I need tag the

[47:01]
please send it to me cuz I need tag the
man so what did you do with the schoolie
when you started rolling these out I
mean you told me you don't have another
driver how do you manage two vehicles if
it's just you
driving yeah so the school is in the
process of being converted to a trailer
bus the trailer bus is now my platform
I've basically done what I need to do
and I believe in it now I know it's a
good platform so my goal is to
essentially FN off all the naysayers
long enough until it's kind of accepted
by the public as a legitimate
Transportation option what did you do
with your pricing when when it launched
I mean your demand went through the roof
so how much did you come up on prices we
bumped it up like it's at 179 right now
and I was kind of trying to
resist like everyone's raising their
rates for because of inflation and
everything else I was trying to resist
that as much as possible um so I only

[48:01]
that as much as possible um so I only
brought it up yeah I think I only
brought up like 10 bucks which which
wasn't too much of a raise uh but I have
enough capacity on the semi that on
Sundays and Fridays at least like I will
often get almost to the top but not not
quite to the top of my capacity
Saturdays I have so much demand usually
that I did some where I I do two tours
simultaneously which lets me take 80
people at 80 people over a 5 hour period
W instead of instead of 40 people over a
5 hour period that works great how do
you manage that logistically let's say
you have 80 people I I'll split them
into you know group Alpha and and group
beta and then group Alpha will meet us
at 10:15 we'll load them up take them to
the first Winery let's say msia and then
we'll come back and we'll have the
second group meet us at the same spot

[49:02]
second group meet us at the same spot
where we did the initial pickup at 11:30
we'll take group beta to messia and now
both groups are at messia but group
Alpha is done and they're ready to go to
the next Winery and and group beta has
another hour so then we'll go yep so
we're just basically we're shuttling
them back and forth yeah a little more
driving but well worth the cost yeah
Keeps Us busy I like
what happened to your insurance like
when you when you had to switch to the
trailer bus from 40 Grand to what did
that look like it's nuts I need to
calculate my all-in cost for my
insurance but yeah year one somewhere
around 75 to 80 something like that for
the one vehicle for one year which is
crazy right that's that's Co that's the
cost of a Tesla every year right you
know to ensure one vehicle so I got to
buy a brand new Tesla and pay it off
every single year
yeah for the insurance yeah but it's

[50:01]
yeah for the insurance yeah but it's
like your capacity almost tripled I mean
way more than tripled when you when
you're able to do 80 in five hours on a
Saturday so you you net out ahead but 80
grand a year geez Louise that's a ton
yeah so overtime overtime you know
that'll come down the longer we're on
the road you know we'll we'll have to
see how much I'm actually in the process
of you know coming up on our annual
renewal for for the insurance and I'm
just uhoh I'm just hoping it's different
yeah so the video I posted across all
platforms it's got like 21 or 22 million
views has that done anything like oh my
God potential yeah because it like
Facebook was almost 10 million Instagram
Tik Tok 66 each I didn't even know you
posted on Tik Tok yeah yeah okay has
that brought anything or oh yeah yeah
yeah yeah thank you for posting that
yeah thank you really appreciate that no

[51:01]
yeah thank you really appreciate that no
it was great for me too I mean I got
newsletter subscribers and it's it's a
great product and it's you built it so
it's all things to you what are your
shiny objects right now like are there
any opportunities that you want to chase
within this sphere or opportunities that
you think other people could could Chase
within this sphere that you're not you
know I was trying to think of kind of
like your audience what in this space
how could I be helpful and you know
maybe give some ideas generally this
whole thing took off by obviously
chasing something that I was interested
in so that's number one anything that
you think is cool you can probably make
cool and convince someone else you know
you can make it into a business you just
have to you have to love it yourself
otherwise don't do it but that's your
best parameter something I've definitely
learned is that talking about Recession
Proof or whatever I think one of the
most
defensible businesses you can have

[52:00]
defensible businesses you can have
period is
something where people are having a good
time have a business that helps people
have a great time you want to add
something into that that makes you
completely different from everyone else
it doesn't have to be as monstrous as
you know my creation but it just needs
to be something where you know the way
that human psychology works it'll stick
in someone's mind you're the person that
does this from this angle I think I'd
mentioned kind of on the aside I've gone
back and forth about like I'm not a
greedy person I want to see the trailer
bus platform be adopted everywhere but
I've been cautious to tell people to do
it because you know I remember at Tesla
days people just aren't very like the
public psychology is is it works a
certain way so anything that's new is
under a much higher level of scrutiny
usually an unfair amount of scrutiny
it's held to an almost impossible

[53:01]
it's held to an almost impossible
standard but it's definitely held to a
standard that you know competitive
products are not held to so like when
when Tesla first started having um
battery fires from like a collision
usually something puncturing underneath
the whole public freaked out you know
basically you had this giant percentage
of the public saying see Told You So
electric cars are garbage they can catch
on fire when they've been an accident we
shouldn't have electric cars so it
didn't matter that the percentage of
cars catching on fire is less than you
know percentage of cars catching on fire
if they're they're gas gas car it makes
for a good headline yeah but just so you
know if you're driving a gas powerered
car that thing can blow up you know that
thing can explode in a big ball of flame
so I'm conscientious about the first
time there's an incident or an accident
on a trailer bus even you know depending

[54:00]
on a trailer bus even you know depending
on how it is and there will be one one
day because yeah lar numers statistics
yep that's statistics if it hasn't you
know gotten into the public far enough
yet there's a possibility of uh some
serious backlash and then that would
basically shut down everything
everywhere but I do you know I've
thought about that I do think that this
is a good platform I do think people if
they're willing to get through to go
through the hell that I did I would say
do it and I would just you know
basically my Approach is going to be
anyone that does a trailer bus um I
would love if they would reach out to me
and I'll basically say make sure to do
these things so that it's safe and so
that your business is legit and so that
it lasts I think that's kind of the
approach that I'm taking so I don't know
if that answered your question but so do
you think trailer bus tours like this
could work basically anywhere with

[55:00]
could work basically anywhere with
anything just because of how polarizing
it looks yeah anywhere I mean you'll get
to a certain point where it's saturated
enough in sort of the public mind that
it's not a novelty anymore but I've
already kind of thought through all
right if I ever get to that point what
am I going to be doing and I'm already
think about all kinds of different
things I can do so it's good it's like 6
months ago there was one cyber truck in
my town and it turned my head every time
and now I see them all over but so it's
like the the virality of it gets you you
know from zero to one but then it being
just a good product gets you from one to
10 and Beyond you know what I'm saying
yeah so exactly I mean I'm not saying
anything and I'm sure you're not already
thinking of but I see your future as
selling these freaking retrofitted
trailer buses all over the country for a
lot of money to people giving tours all
over the world yeah yeah I think I think
it should be done and we probably at
some point you know I I kind of have

[56:00]
some point you know I I kind of have
there's tons of people that have
interest there's probably some point
where we find the right partner I don't
know what it'll be but they'll come in
we'll like them personally you know
they're more than capable of funding to
the amount that I would like to
basically you know spin out a company
that does some form of franchising I
think what I ideally what would happen
is someone came in with
funding I franchise it out at a
percentage rate that is more than fair
so that anyone who wants to do a trailer
bus they're going to be like well you
know if it's four to
5% and that's it plus the cost of
building out the product which we
wouldn't you know in my mind I wouldn't
even charge a fee for like hey I'm going
to take a 10 or $30,000 fee for your I
can't remember what it's called for
onboarding basically just take a small
small percentage of your revenues once
you're once you're in Into the Future

[57:00]
you're once you're in Into the Future
doing that would kind of allow me to
make sure that everyone is I want to
Define Industry Safety standards make
sure that everyone's successful has the
best practices you know have economies
of scale that I can use to leverage for
anyone who's under our our franchise
umbrella basically so that it's way more
beneficial for anyone who is looking at
doing a trailer bus to just become part
of our franchise
versus doing it on their own not because
I'm greedy because I it actually sounds
like a ton of work and I don't yeah I I
have you know I have money and success
now to the level that I need to to be
happy in my life I I don't I don't need
to to go more but more so so that we can
like I said set those industry standards
bring it into the safe keep it safe keep
it safe until I don't have to be
involved anymore it's ready to go so I
think I think that'll probably happen at
some point maybe I'll I'll post

[58:00]
some point maybe I'll I'll post
something on social media maybe I'll
reach out to one of the people that's
already said tell me how I can be
involved and invest in this or whatever
or you know who knows someone on on uh
your show may call me whatever probably
do that I think maybe in about a year or
so but that's kind of where I see this
going okay well I hope they do and if
they want to reach out to you Kevin how
can they find you what's the best way
well obviously we got toasted tours is
our Instagram handle so that's great and
my information will be on there our
contacts our contact page so yeah just
get a hold of us through there okay
thanks for your time man no thank you
this is amazing all right thanks for
coming to the ker office we'll see you
next time
