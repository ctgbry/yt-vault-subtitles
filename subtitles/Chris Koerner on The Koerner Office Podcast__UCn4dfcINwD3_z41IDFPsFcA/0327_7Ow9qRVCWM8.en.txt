[00:00]
I wanted to run it full-time don't
believe in doing things parttime route
density is where I make my money the
denser I keep my route more money I make
I kind of view as that Pepsi and Coke
thing too right they put machines right
next to each other and they both grow in
sales your back's against the wall trust
me when you got to put food on the table
for your kids you think a little
differently the cleanliness of a
bathroom in a restaurant or a gas
station tells you everything about the
management of that business how did you
find those 300 customers like what's the
8020 of
[Music]
it welcome to the ker office we did a
deep dive today on the trash bin
cleaning industry which is a super fast
growing industry one that a lot of
people are interested in because you can
get a tight route density and you can
get monthly recurring Revenue like a
software business with very low churn
and it can be very profitable business
so Jason Feller was managing clubs for
his full-time job for 20 years and he
got sick of it he got sick of missing
his kids sports activities and being
away from his family so he quit his job
bought a $48,000 trash bin cleaning
trailer and now does this full-time and

[01:01]
trailer and now does this full-time and
he has 300 recurring customers Jason was
very generous with his time and so if
anyone is interested in starting this
business or at least learning about this
business how to find customers how to
reverse engineer this how to be
profitable how to get a better route
density then you're going to love this
please share with a friend and we'll see
you next time well why don't we just
start by telling us who you are sure you
know Jason Feller here and coming up
through the service industry I thought I
wanted to be a chef in high school and
went to colonary Arts uh programs in
high school school and magnet school
down in talson Maryland Carver Center
for art and technology and before I went
to college had a great conversation with
my parents of what are you going to do
if you don't want to be a chef and what
can you do if you know if you go get a
regular education and kind of if you
want to go back and be a chef you can do
that still so went to University of
Delaware graduated back in 2003 and then
realized maybe I didn't want to be a
chef I loveed to love cooking and I
still love cooking and playing with food
and making that my art but it was an art
for me and had work at a number of

[02:01]
for me and had work at a number of
private country clubs at that time and
takes a private Country Club management
courses I saw that I loved service I
loved taking care of people and making
sure people were happy in the end and in
private club management I got to serve
and ensure that people were happy some
days you know you were resolving
problems and some days you were you were
bringing that experience and I thought
the experience was cool so fast forward
20 years I've bounced around the east
coast in a handful of country cups a few
country clubs that were top of the
nation and a few country Cubs that
needed to to kind of be brought up by
their bootstraps and so 20 years later I
finally decided maybe this side of the
service industry isn't for me at this
point I've got two young young kids one
is in 10th Grade now the other is in
seventh grade now two of my girls and
they're becoming active in band music
experiences and sports and I said what
can I do where I can be around my kids
more and on the time I want to be around

[03:00]
more and on the time I want to be around
my kids so you know the private club
experience it is a a FaceTime experience
and you have to show up and you have to
be there and present when your your
guests are there and unfortunately for a
family lifestyle for me that I was
aiming for it was happening at the you
know 4: to 7:10 p.m. so I'd go to work
and 8:00 am. in the morning I'd be home
at 9 o'clock at night and you just miss
everything I'm curious Jason like what
after managing private clubs for 20
years was there like triggering event or
some impetus that happened where you're
like okay yep I'm done like did you miss
something or was it did just kind of
slowly build up and then you you made
the move it was a slow buildup there was
a couple times when I was when I would
take off to see kids events and
activities and my phone was just ringing
and just texts and saying where where
what's going on with this what's
happening with this and and I said you
know that's not what I'm here for and I
need to separate from that idea of it I
came up from the Hands-On management

[04:00]
came up from the Hands-On management
side of things so I had a guilt for not
being there in present but I want to see
things with my family and that that was
kind of one of those final you know
straws that broke the camel's back there
and said I need to separate I need to to
be part of my family and I need to tell
them a part of the family and shut off
my work phone and not feel guilty you
know how long did it take you to go from
that realization to day one of your
first business and what did that process
look like I've always wanted to own my
own business I've always thought I could
could do it and even with conversations
with the board of directors and people I
worked for at the Country Club a lot of
them would say that they they'd wake up
in the morning and they'd be able to you
know look in the mirror make their own
decision and know that in the end it
rested on that decision that they made
they knew that they were the final one
and in country C management it is a a
different world and you were always
going back and forth with boards if
you've ever volunteered for a nonprofit
or work with any other Charities or
religious organizations a lot of times
they're they're through group decision
it was probably a couple years out where

[05:00]
it was probably a couple years out where
I started saying I want to make my own
decisions 100% I want to start knowing
that that it's all on me so it took me
about two years or so of of thinking
through this process and I still love
clut Cod management I just wanted to
start making the decisions on my own and
one time I was looking and saw that I
was going out to get the dumpster
cleaned at the at the country club
because our dumpster was between the
main entrance for the members and the
entrance for the service staff and our
service staff is walking past this
dumpster and June July and August that
just absolutely red and we have to
provide an experience that is second to
none and they're walking in the first
thing they smell is disgusting and the
first thing they see is disgusting and
then our members were smelling the same
thing so automatically the two people
who I needed to please the most were
were already turned off I'm big on senty
experiences I'm big on the fact that
clean isn't just physically being clean
it's it's the emotion that it gives you
just like some people you know get their

[06:01]
just like some people you know get their
lawn modowe on a regular basis they love
seeing the lines some people like their
house cleaned I I feel that trash can
cleaning was part of that so you know I
saw it starting from the back of the
dumpster and taking care of my employees
my restaurant became cleaner the kitchen
became cleaner the carpets raw cleaner
as soon as we started taking care of
from the back of the the the house you
know some people have written books
about you know it's the broken windows
Theory or the the light bulbs Theory and
for me it's a dumpster Theory you know
start of start of the dumpster start of
your track like the the cleanliness of a
restaurant or the cleanliness of a
bathroom in a restaurant or a gas
station tells you everything about the
management of that business right you
are spoton I just had a conversation
with with the local gas station owner
and they said well why are you choosing
to spend your money with us because I'm
spending roughly $88,000 a year in fuel
right now and you know I said because
you have a great parking lot and I get
my truck and trailer to and I like using
the bathrooms in there because they're
clean because I feel like I can walk in
there and it's it's a feeling it's not

[07:00]
there and it's it's a feeling it's not
uh clean is a feeling it's not just the
appearance of you can spray it down with
sanitizer all you want but yeah okay so
you noticed that these dumpsters were
were stinky you wanted to fix it what
was the next step did you do it yourself
or did you find a company to come do it
so I had tried to get my dishwashers to
do it and they were doing a poor job at
best they didn't want to do it they
didn't have the feeling it was I'm hir
to be a dishwasher they're already you
know being paid at the lowest of the
pace gate scale and they just didn't
they didn't want to do it so I finally
started reaching out the local trash
hauler would have to come out take our
dumpster away from us we had a compactor
they'd have to drop a 40 yard rolloff
dumpster in our driveway and a week
later they'd come back and they return
that that original compactor dumpster
back to us cleaned and we were paying
just shy of $1,000 dollar to have that
done now $1,000 you know for that
experience was was a great price because
I knew that I could get an Initiation

[08:00]
I knew that I could get an Initiation
fee and dues coming in if I could make
sure that the place was maintained at
the top level but $1,000 is a lot of
money to to get that and I said I could
do that cheaper and how often were you
doing it I was doing it it during the
summer once a year okay if I if were
less less expensive I probably would
have done it two or three times a year
or four times a year and then that's
where I started researching it and
saying maybe I can maybe I can do this
maybe I can hire somebody maybe I can
come up with a you know come up with
another business plan and the model that
I'm running right now is majority
residential and I started coming across
there's three or four vendors that make
the trailers industry no one is
currently where there are very few
people that are currently trying to
franchise it but most of them are are
building the trailers there's three or
four companies that are doing that and I
was amazed that they were they were
taking the these regular rolloff trash
cans that most of the Cities provide or
your trash hauler provides and they were
basically doing a quick power wash on
the outside and then you lift them up on
on a boom and over a a receptical to

[09:01]
on a boom and over a a receptical to
catch all the dirty water and junk
that's left in the bottom and they'd
have the these rotating spray heads that
spray into this the trash bin and it
made me think back to my mother-in-law
who used to clean our trash cans for us
and she she couldn't deal with the a
dirty trash can so I started saying wow
this is this is something that people
across the nation are paying for across
the world it appears it it started over
in Europe it was kind of brought back
from overseas and part of that process
process was conser conservation of water
it was rats and animals and flies and
pests in the cities more so that they
were more aware of it you look at the
European cities they have stricter water
controls and they have major pport
problems to that point I've actually
been called in to to a number of
commercial properties and their comments
have been our rat population is down to
nothing now that they had rat problems
the pest control was struggling to take
control of it with the baits that they

[10:01]
control of it with the baits that they
had and we came in we cleaned it up we
removed all the food debris all the the
ingredients that that cause the rat to
stay and make it comfortable for them so
again it's about a feeling but it's also
it's the cleanliness and that was in a
commercial dumpster then right correct
so I I've I've worked with commercial
establishments as well but 90% of my my
90% of my customer base is residential
okay all right so you start doing some
research on the trailers now is this a
purpose-built truck or literally just a
trailer it is a purpose built trailer
and again these Builders are building
them in truck format they're building
them in uh skid format to go into the
back of a truck if you look at a 3/4 ton
or one ton truck and they're also
building building them in trailer format
I chose to go with the used trailer
versus getting it out there and putting
my entire you know lump sum out there
trucks are expensive you know they're
built on the suu nrr frame or or
something that is above that that one
ton frame and they get expensive and I

[11:01]
ton frame and they get expensive and I
knew this business was not going to be
an overnight success I knew going into
this I would not be able to put $ th
dollar down and triple it
overnight it was intended to be a three
to five year Hall to create a business
that was was a model of of success and
stability versus having to generate
something new every day okay so how much
did the trailer set you back and what
would a new one have been of the same
making model I chose to go with the used
trailer and I was in at roughly
$48,000 into the trailer uh I had to
make some modifications to it initially
as again I wanted to operate out of my
house so we had to make some
modifications to the trailer so it would
fit in my garage a new trailer was at
that point in time running roughly
$70,000 and there was a six to 12 month
weit wow so I chose to to try and save
it up front yeah and I bought into a
business branding already that someone
had already created website and so it

[12:00]
had already created website and so it
had already created uh some of the
marketing materials so that saved me
roughly another
$5,000 right there those were things
that in the beginning were valuable to
me so was this someone that was going
out of business it was okay so someone
who was running as a part-time gig they
had a successful job in in another job
and they wanted to keep that other job
whereas I was saying you know I'm going
all in on this and I could you know I
probably could have hired somebody to
run this business for me there's a
number of people across the nation that
have done that they keep their their day
jobs and they're hiring people to to run
the trucks and trailers for them I chose
that it was something that that I wanted
to to jump out and run on my own but I
wanted to run it full-time I don't
believe in doing things part-time yeah I
love it all or nothing that's how I am
yeah your back's against the wall trust
me when you got to put food on the table
for your kids you think a little
differently yep there's no plan B nope
did you get any customers with him or
how far away was his route or territory

[13:00]
how far away was his route or territory
so he was based out of Pittsburgh I'm
based out of the east coast of
Pennsylvania south south of Philadelphia
so four hour four hour difference when I
looked at at his customer base it wasn't
worth me trying to to run from out from
here to hire somebody out in Pittsburg
to run that that business model he he
had been in business for a number of
years and hadn't picked up a ton of
customers so I think he'd been in
business for four or five years and you
know I've already tripled the amount of
customers that he had on regular basis
partially by doing it full-time he was
again only doing parttime did that
concern you at all like even though you
had already this one one sample size and
you'd already done a ton of research I'm
sure was that kind of demoralizing to
know that he hadn't made it work or what
what made you think that you could do it
differently other than just being
full-time that's a great question it
gives me a little pause there no I had I
had spoken to six or seven different
companies some some who were doing well
some who weren't when you go looking for
the classifi Everyone is always selling

[14:01]
the classifi Everyone is always selling
in the classifi and I always think it's
the funniest question is is oh this must
be terrible this must be terrible
everyone's always selling well if you go
to to loopnet or Biz bis byell they're
always selling their business that's
that's the intent of of those sites uh
so the classified sections are always
selling I talked to a number of business
business owners and reached out to them
directly I was watching a couple
podcasts and I reached out to them
directly there's and I said what are you
doing what are you doing right what are
you doing wrong and you know what are my
expectations there's a couple guys that
that started taking money after two
years and there's a couple guys that
five six seven years in haven't taken
money and they're all running the
business model slightly differently it
was a lot of the conversation was about
focus and focusing on the business and
if you have the focus on a business it
will grow I can tell you that that's
what's happened for me if you have that
focus on the business it can grow and
I'm just you know a year and a half in
I'm just TR 300 maintenance customers

[15:01]
I'm just TR 300 maintenance customers
and that say maintenance as a
subscription model and you know I intend
to grow in another 75% next year I
probably won't be able to double it I'd
love to but I probably won't be able to
and I'm profitable now profitable it's
not again I'm not an overnight
millionaire here but yeah I'm starting
to make money and that's amazing that's
a good sign and and so how how far into
it are you
today I started in February of 23 so I'm
just about 18 months okay and how did
you find those 300 customers like what's
the 8020 of it it is a grind Facebook is
amazing uh and I participate in my local
chamber I like to talk to people get out
there and have that conversation get the
trailer in front of people and be
visible and present that is so you know
Facebook and being visible and present I
did walk tag trash cans one of the
models work considering right now is

[16:00]
models work considering right now is
door- knocking I am we go back and forth
you know my wife is is a part owner in
the business and we go back and forth
that's we we always hated when people
came to our doors but at the same time
it's a model in this industry that has
proven itself to to be successful and so
we're trying to find that happy happy
medium of staying true to our values of
wanting to keep people's space protected
to them but also to you know grow the
business yeah I want to get back to that
but I want to go back to Faceook
Facebook so when I when I think of
Facebook I think of like four pillars
there's like you know organic Facebook
there's Facebook groups there's Facebook
Marketplace and then there's Facebook
paid ads what has worked the best for
you you said organic groups Facebook
Marketplace paid
and and well or organic like posting on
Facebook to your friends and then
Facebook groups Facebook Marketplace
Facebook ads Facebook groups I post in
religiously it's if it's the first and
15th I post in them
and then I asked for my customers to

[17:00]
and then I asked for my customers to
post in them I get the best response
when it's I guess it would be an organic
post into a group where my customer says
Hey I just use Crystal Clean cans and my
trash cans have never smelled better I'm
not afraid to go to them anymore and
next thing you know I've got massive
amounts of hits to my website whether
it's or my Facebook page I have new
signups that is the best hands down this
year I've actually paid for more
advertising I was not doing much
advertising last year I've bumped up my
sponsored sponsored ads and trying to
create that feedback link and loop where
they're having to to submit information
to me so I get a little bit of their
information they get a discount code in
response to that so that would probably
be my my second my second biggest
through Facebook there what I've
actually found is a lot of people don't
use that discount link because I track
you know the names yeah and they'll sign
up without the discount link and okay
great what that perfect it's great you
know I love it but I can track that that
they've they've sent me a message
through there yeah you know maybe

[18:01]
through there yeah you know maybe
someone's looking at it saying it's only
10 bucks or it's only 25% but uh they
aren't using that discount link which
yeah I find intriguing now when you say
sponsored posts like what what do you
mean like are you is that a boosted
Facebook Marketplace listing or a
sponsored ad I don't use Marketplace for
for Facebook specifically I use the the
sponsored ads and go meta ad advertising
process uh so you're just you're posting
and then you're boosting that post
no actually so I keep my my ads
completely separate from my my Facebook
so these are proper Facebook ads that
you're running as well correct proper
Facebook ads intended intended to Target
audiences and I identify the audiences I
want to Target again ironically you know
last year we went in think it was going
to be 65 and olders it is not I'm
looking for 35 to 54 year olds that have
kids in the home pets at home and that
are busy that don't want to take that
extra time that that say you know what
my trash cans are dirty and I don't want

[19:01]
my trash cans are dirty and I don't want
to take that extra time to clean it look
my wife hadn't touched our trash cans in
eight years so now she'll actually go
out the trash can yeah so how much do
you charge and what is your turnover
like your churn or how C how long do
customers stay with you on average we
have four different pricing plans we we
did discontinue one pricing plan we
discontinued the bonly plan six times a
year it did not fit with our our routes
so I after monthly quarterly twice a
year and one-time clean currently
roughly 80 to 85% of our our subscribers
are in the quarter late plan and you
know we're the Mid-Atlantic we do
operate all year all year long we have
some heavy heat in the the Summers and
sometimes we can get some cold Winters
so this be the second winner season I'm
going through the second part of your
question was and I got off my tant what
do you charge so it's uh charging is $25
a month for two cans most likely we'll
we'll discuss and review if that goes up
next year not probably somewhere around
April May $35 a month on a quarterly

[20:02]
April May $35 a month on a quarterly
basis or $35 a quarter excuse me on a
quarterly basis for two cans and then H
for the twice a year it's $50 each time
and one time is $65 and that's all all
pricing for two cans 85% on quarterly
then huh correct we're looking at some
of the different different models we've
had some requests from our customers to
do let's call it a I call a seasonal
package and I'm looking at seasonal
packages right now you know April
through October doing a monthly plan and
then doing a oneoff in the middle of the
winter one of my fears is that that if I
do it the April through October I won't
have any business in the middle of
winter I want to kind of figure out how
to keep that that going our our turn on
our business I've lost two customers due
to
dissatisfaction and I've lost 10
customers to moving I'm I'm trying to
think of my numbers in my head and I
verified that they moved too one said
they felt like they were paying too much
and the the other felt felt like it was
just never clean enough for them and
so I said okay you know i' have have now

[21:02]
so I said okay you know i' have have now
had had over 500 customers I said okay I
can lose two for that wow that those are
great numbers so you've had over 500
customers total and you have 300
recurring today so correct 200 of those
either churned out or were just one time
correct
customers of my subscribers only only
have lost 12 subscribers okay my one
times that's what they sign up for and I
yeah I expect that I have to chase them
again yeah all right if you are watching
this clip right now you are watching
this on YouTube and if you are a fan of
podcast please check out my podcast
while you're at it because sometimes I
have podcasts that aren't on YouTube and
sometimes I have YouTubes that aren't on
podcast so check out the ker office on
any podcast platform or you can go to
TKO pod.com also my newsletter will
throw that in there there are no ads
It's weekly it's different content than
my podcast and YouTube newsletter.
chrisj cerner.com You'll see the link
and we'll see you there have you thought
about changing your pricing to make the
the monthly option more attractive as
opposed to like a seasonal thing like
you just said or maybe the better

[22:02]
you just said or maybe the better
question is what are your costs on like
one wash if if you're doing it yourself
vers having an employee do
it if I'm doing it myself versus having
an employee do it so I get my goal is
actually to get to somewhere between 800
and 1500 customers here and be able to
determine my next business level once I
get to there so you know my fixed cost
right now are roughly $3 a stop okay
fuel fuel and and windshield time are my
big biggest expenses that's one of the
reasons why I'm probably not going to
look at lowering the monthly cost and
increasing the monthly cost I can fit
more people onto a quarterly schedule uh
than I can on a monthly schedule I I
would end up having less customers on a
monthly schedule just because of of
windshield time uh you know if you're
looking at roughly six minutes a stop
the max you know I could get into a
route you know would be be 10 an hour
and if I can increase my my business
capacity on the qual level I think

[23:00]
capacity on the qual level I think
that's where I'm going to continue to
push towards and try and make the
actually go the opposite way of of what
my you know what makes sense to to or
made sense to me in the beginning it
makes sense to me sometimes too is
trying to push for monthly I'm thinking
of pushing towards quaries okay you know
in the winter time you know some of the
complaints have been is well you know do
I need my trash can cleaned every month
in the winter yeah so I've got to figure
out that again it's a feeling you know
yeah germs buildt up the same way it's
just the feeling of clean and the smell
like the smell is not quite there in the
winter flies are down smells down and
you've probably noticed like a lot of
like it might not be as necessary every
month right correct and I think you're
you're spot on some people in this
especially in this Mid-Atlantic region
if you were down to Florida and Texas uh
100% I'd be going for monthly you know
it would be it would be my target is
monthly if I was in Florida you know i'
I'd probably even look at doing it every
other week you have the humidity you

[24:01]
other week you have the humidity you
have the heat consistently except for
what December and January probably you
probably have those two months off uh
but up here you know it's it's my
customer acquisition is is dropping
right now I'm
not it's getting cold people are saying
you know starting to go back indoors
yeah and they're not walking past their
trash can as much their trash can's in
their garage it's an better temperature
control state right now yeah even though
flies produce at a faster rate right now
they're they're temperature control
state so okay so about 140 bucks a year
per customer for 300 customers do you
have any employees or is it just you
right now it is just me right now okay I
love that like you know all these
numbers like yeah had two churn this guy
that guy they're you know one two three
Maple they're like you only know that if
you're only in the business and like
really beautiful things happen when
you're only in that one business it's
the only thing you're doing like that's
how the best businesses are built that's

[25:00]
how the best businesses are built that's
my hope is that I can focus on it
without over obsessing on it and and
it's always a challenge you know coming
from the world I came from you know
focus on on some of those details there
I can grow it by knowing where I need to
be and when I need to be there you know
right now I'm manually doing all the
mapping and route planning I'm manually
doing all the texting I'm manually doing
all the email blasts so there is a a
knowledge that you gain from that and
yes I would love to to train people to
do my job that is my ultimate goal I
love leadership I love businesses and
business growth in the short term you've
gota you got to dig in and you got to
say I've done this before yeah okay so
75 homes a quarter how long does it take
you to do those 75 homes I know the
routes are weird and you got to work
around some external circumstances but
let's say that you know all else equal
how much time does it take to do those
75 homes so usually it's probably
roughly 12 hours a month you know 15

[26:01]
roughly 12 hours a month you know 15
hours a month out there on the road
you're not out there a ton it's again
you're it's it's more of windshield time
I live in Southern Chester County
Pennsylvania Rolling Hills beautiful
Rolling Hills and Countryside I cover
180 you know 180 square miles is what
I'm covering and that is probably
probably my biggest or is my biggest
factor is getting across the county to
where I need to be once I get into a
neighborhood I can knock out anywhere
from six to 12 homes in an hour and so
again we talk about targeting you know
certain markets once I get into a
neighborhood I'm targeting that
neighborhood and I'm working with the
the you know my customers to reach out
to the neighborhood and say by the way
if we get to 10 homes we'll get a price
break and cool you know I'd love to get
to 25 homes I have one that's got 23
homes in the neighborhood like to get it
to 25 homes what do you think is
different about that neighborhood with
23 homes it is younger families it is

[27:01]
23 homes it is younger families it is
younger upand cominging families that
that are have their kids in in sports
and schools and they they're
participating in other things they have
pets at home and they have they're
required their HOA requires them keep
their their containers in their garage
and they're saying well I got to walk
past my trash trash can every single day
and it reachs so at least if I could
take that off for a period of time what
would you say is the average home value
of that neighborhood compared to your
average neighborhood or the other
neighborhoods I'm not sure I can relate
it to home values you're probably
looking at at a you know $550,000 home
uh I serve homes anywhere from 300,000
to you know 3 million probably looking
at 500 to $600,000 the value of the home
I'm not sure I can relate that to
anything that that that I see as far as
customer pickups I actually have a
couple more than a couple now in mobile
home parks uh where again they just they

[28:00]
home parks uh where again they just they
value the feeling of cleanliness yeah so
I have not been able to directly
correlate that I'm just wondering if
like if there's like a style of home or
a yearbuilt or something that you could
correlate to the type of person that's
more likely to live in the home and go
that direction for
customer I'll have to I'll have to dig a
little deeper into that so yeah I mean
they're probably in their their late 30s
to to early 50s and they're managing bit
they're probably midlevel career career
in their in their management levels
there and two income earning families
for the majority of them and they've i'
say the majority of them have have
multiple kids I'd be curious to get all
take the spreadsheet that I'm sure you
already have of all your your addresses
and have a virtual assistant just go to
Zillow one by one and just assign a home
value to all of them just to observe and
look and like sort and and look for
patterns like oh okay oh interesting huh
I I bet you would learn a lot there
yeah yeah I think it's an interesting

[29:01]
yeah yeah I think it's an interesting
case study I'm actually I'm working with
someone right now on on looking at the
demographics of of where I am and and
locations and and highlighting them and
saying all right these are homes I
should be targeting more these be you
know based on government data how many
people would you say live within your
route area there's roughly 120,000 homes
within my route area wow specifically
look at people as people I try at the
homes so it's probably like almost half
a million people 400,000 people I maybe
for 1% if I can if I could Target 1% one
to two% that makes a great business for
me you know I'm I'm looking to to for
lifestyle first over over money yeah if
you got a customer in like the corner of
your Market it's not in a neighborhood
it's just on a main road would you say
no to them or no gosh that's the hardest
part about business is saying no but
that's also the best part is coming from
Country Club man management and private
club management you would always figure
out how to say yes and not that I'm

[30:00]
out how to say yes and not that I'm
figuring out how to say no right now but
I've had to say no it just doesn't make
sense I had someone that was literally
50 minutes from my house and it was it
is exactly as you're talking about and I
finally said to them I said hey look I
hate to send you to my competitor but I
have a competitor that's servicing your
area that that's more local to you some
of them I've said if I can pick up you
know a few more people in your
neighborhood or nearby then I'll I'll
try it and I'll try it for a year I'm
going through that process right now of
looking at one or two homes that are on
that edge and pulling back my territory
I use I use a program called my service
area and that helps me keep my area
tight and I just keep reminding myself I
need to keep my area tight route density
is where I make my money the denser I
keep my my route the more money I make
per hour the more money that I make you
know from my cleanings and so I'm really
you you're hit the nail on the head
there so so you're really on the road
for like 3 hours a week is all uh it's
it's a little a little bit more than
that you know it's it's 12 a month so

[31:00]
that you know it's it's 12 a month so
I'm trying but it does it not shake out
just cleaning it's 12 a month I'm I'm
I'm on the road if I'm on the road it's
probably three hours each day but just
cleaning the cans is maybe 12 hours max
okay but still three hours a day that's
not like five days a week we're talking
no I've I've again I've done route
density so I'm right now I'm maybe
working three days a week wow okay is my
goal out there just be present my my
viewpoint on business is to be present
to be you know out there among among
people and uh the more I'm out there
having those conversations ay it's less
expensive than paying to Market but be
it creates a long-term effect yeah
people know your name people know the
business and if I can keep that steady
it's obviously a philosophy and
mentality it uh sometimes it works and
sometimes it doesn't yeah that is kind
of an interesting framework of you know
these business ideas that can be
part-time because not all of them can
it's almost like a potential trap like

[32:00]
it's almost like a potential trap like
it's a trap to incite you to split your
attention between other things like
maybe a second side hustle or a
full-time job and so it's it's almost
like you have to be extra committed to
what you're doing if you have something
that might only take a few hours a day
but if you are the reward is is massive
right you're saying the right things or
at least recognizing the right things is
that there are many times my my
concentration starts to get diverted and
I say well what about this idea what
about that idea how do I incorporate
this they end up chasing you know this
wild dream down the the line even you
know I love businesses I love thinking
the idea of these things but sometimes
you end up chasing the wrong direction
away from your business model it is
sometimes dangerous in starting a
business you truly have to stop and say
wait a second yeah who am I talking to
am I tagging trash cans today am I doing
you know you know going to a chamber
event am I going to a different meeting
a networking meeting what am I doing to

[33:00]
a networking meeting what am I doing to
to stay focused on my business yeah how
does tagging trash cans go like what is
your do you know what your conversion
rate I assume you're just like putting
flyers on the trash can yeah so some
people use can like door hangers on the
handles of the trash cans I use a little
postcard with a discount code on it and
a sticky and I can either drive down the
road and tag them or I can walk down you
know a couple neighborhoods or six and
seven miles of walking so it's you know
it's a little bit of timec consuming I
would say that the process you you have
you cannot truly see a direct return on
that you know every once in a while I
get someone saying I I saw from The
Hanger the trash can tag what I found is
many of the customers I've had to tag
their neighborhoods three or four times
and I you know and usually it's about
two months later that I'll see them sign
up which I I find really interesting is
it's not an immediate it's not an
immediate thing in those tag
neighborhoods those people who searched
for me on Google it's an imate sign up
those people who come to me through

[34:00]
those people who come to me through
Facebook it's it's an immediate sign up
the trash can tags it's it' be the same
as direct now to me where I truly have
to invest in that and it is a Time basis
it is three six nine months I you know I
have one that just came to me and it was
literally 12 months later and they said
oh I got a tag in my trash can and I
went and looked at my sheet and I said I
haven't tagged that for 12 months wow
and so somebody held on to it for 12
months and and until it made sense to
them do you have any any bearing on how
many tags you put out there to the world
and how many customers that those have
brought you
in you're probably not gonna like to
hear that I probably put put out roughly
6,000 tags or so probably brought me in
customers that's okay for me again you
know this is the the philosophy of I'm G
to hear no a lot it is not something
that people think of it's not something
that most people you know look you know
lawn care you know in the 80s who would

[35:01]
lawn care you know in the 80s who would
have thought that that you would have
had people mowing your lawn every week
you'd be paying them to do it that was
ridiculous for my Irish to think of well
why not go get your own tractor and do
it well now I I know three people in my
neighborhood of 75 that move their own
lawn you know because just the process
of having someone else do it it
simplifies their life yeah and including
me I did did the you know the cost
benefit analysis and I said I'm going to
spend how much on a trctor and I can
spend how much on you know having
someone else my
lawn you know so that's kind of the way
I see it with trash can cleaning it's
GNA come it's gonna come along as long
as you can say the the path it's GNA
come along and you'll get yeah and
you'll ride the wave ride the wave slow
and steady how are how are competitors
for you is it a is it a real threat or
is it just kind of like a an annoyance
or is not really there that's an
annoyance you know the some of the the
Press local pressure washing guys you
know try and clean trash cans and that's
in annoyance there is a one local guy

[36:01]
in annoyance there is a one local guy
local 45 minutes away he covers the same
you know similar territory to me he's
got a truck and that has been good and
bad by us both Marketing in this region
I believe we both benefited you know
I've talked to him we have a seemingly
you know open relationship we've both
benefit from it he's had some of his
best years he's three years into the
industry and he's had some of his best
years now that I've jumped in and
started marketing and advertising
because again I'll get call saying oh I
saw your truck here and I know I wasn't
in that neighborhood yeah yeah and it
just happens that they cut my marketing
and advertising after seeing his truck
yeah the the pressure washer guys are
are a little bit of annoyance because
they they add it on and they you know
low clean for $5 a clean can and you're
saying what you know what are you doing
you know you're spending 20 minutes on
that can you know to clean it and then
you're dumping the stuff in the street
so all their debris in their driveway
and you know it just doesn't make sense
to me that is an interesting Dynamic

[37:00]
to me that is an interesting Dynamic
when a new customer comes in it it
doesn't happen everywhere but in new
Industries it certainly does and I
remember Elon Musk talking about this
with Tesla where he was thrilled that
every car company in the world was
making electric vehicles because it was
growing their business it was educating
everyone that's really interesting I
kind of view as that Pepsi and Coke
thing too right they put machines right
next to each other and they both grow in
sales I know a few people who own
multiple bit restaurants and they
literally own one right across the
street from the other and and they just
it benefits off that and that's what I'm
again you know this is a little bit of a
business philosophy and and hoping that
it pays off and it's a risk I'm willing
to take it's understanding that I have a
competitor in the market I'm okay with
that what do you hate about the business
alone time yeah I I like people you're
an
extrovert yeah I like being around
people and for me right now being in the
the truck it is there is a benefit of it
of being alone but sometimes I have a
little bit too much alone time yeah and

[38:01]
little bit too much alone time yeah and
uh if you're in the truck alone it's
it's tough yeah and then what do you
love about
it h i I like that it's mine I like that
that if if I'm going to change something
I get to make that change I like I have
you know I talk about being alone but
I've met a lot of customers I've met a
lot of you know a lot of people and I
like being part of the community I like
being able to say that I want to sponsor
the local hunger walk or you know
someone's t-ball league or whatever it
may be I like being able to make that
decision on my own and say you know I
can participate in that like you know
it's my business I can you know I know
there's no no immediate Roi on
sponsoring t-ball yeah you know what
there's some kid that's out there having
a good time and their family gets to to
watch their kid have a good time and I
know you know watching my kid swim and
watch my kid play in marching band you
know those are the things that that are
meaningful to me that's what I like
about being a business owner yeah
process uh as far as trash can cleaning

[39:00]
process uh as far as trash can cleaning
I like knowing they have clean trash
cans I like the the feeling that I get
when it smells like like orange and
citrus afterwards and there's no you
know gum stuck to it and there's no dirt
stuck to the inside of the can it feels
good to see clean yeah I'm glad you said
that about loving being able to make
your own decisions because that's
something that I know I take for granted
because I've been self-employed forever
you know so for me it's normal to just
go do what I want but that's a luxury
right that that really is I I reported
to a board of nine and I had uh 11
committees that I worked with each
committee had anywhere between seven and
14 people on it one of the the bad
things about country C management is is
some things take time because you're
you're working through many opinions and
many feelings on it and it's also one of
the greatest things you know if I were
to change something about my business
model right now is I've got to get out
of that mentality of taking my time to
do things I've got to be faster to
action I've got to be faster to to
getting out there it just was not the

[40:01]
getting out there it just was not the
mentality that came in safety was in
taking time and making sure you had Buy
in from everybody so I'm I'm learning a
lot as I grow my entrepreneurial Spirit
here what are your net margins like in
the business I would imagine they're
they're pretty good it's a numbers game
right so I'm looking at I'm trying to
look at my numbers here I apologize but
you know I'm looking at the cost to
clean a trash can is is roughly $3 a
clean two trash cans again my that's my
fixed cost it's it's uh when I start
looking at Fuel and time marketing
dollars that add in there so and the the
lease of the equipment or the um
payments for the equipment it's not
lease but the loan for the equipment so
you know once I can get this up to scale
my margin looks that much better next
year is going to look that much better
because my fixed costs are already there
right now you know my my net profit is
is what a know 20% on that as your route

[41:01]
is what a know 20% on that as your route
density goes up it only gets better
that's the goal if I were to to be able
to to get that down quite a bit you know
my cost to customer acquisition is
roughly $50 right now when I could start
getting that down to $20 that makes a
big difference yeah is this a business
that you going back in time that you
would start all over again or second
similar question would you recommend the
others start this business if if not why
yes I would start over again I might do
some things differently I would have
started with a little bit more cash in
my operating accounts you know I
literally came into this I put my money
into my equipment and I had $4,000 in
cash to start the business and I
probably would have put 20 or $330,000
in cash in there and that way I I would
have had a little bit more Comfort I
would have marketed more you know I was
you know last year I think I spent
$6,000 on marketing this year I bumped
it up to to $8,000 in marketing that
really is not a lot of money to Market
your business
yeah I would recommend other people if
they were to look at it to to look at it

[42:01]
they were to look at it to to look at it
that way get in you know your equipment
for what you can afford but make sure
you have enough to to truly fund the
business yeah and that was some of my
you know pipe dream of first-time
entrepreneurship is oh it's going to
grow it's going to grow it's going to
grow uh there is a certain reality that
hits you in that process I would
certainly started again I would you know
again potentially look at maintaining a
full-time job and hiring someone to do
this and starting at that point and
understanding maybe it's a loss leader
for a little bit longer than it is than
it is a profit maker yeah because right
now I have to look at how do I make
profit first you look at a lot of the
big companies the Amazon that that don't
make profit for how many years these
major corporations businesses they've
chosen that business model to grow the
business and not make make money I have
to look at it the opposite way what
opportunities have you been saying no to
like other businesses or like additional
service is that you still think are
great opportunities I find myself saying

[43:01]
great opportunities I find myself saying
no to a lot because I'm a dreamer I
dream a lot right now I'm still trying
to figure out how to whether it's worth
getting into window washing and solar
panel cleaning I'm not quite seeing the
the profitability in that without having
to again being another trash can
cleaning business where you have to do
hundreds of customers I am doing P power
washing because that that is a vertical
that worked within the equipment that I
have power washing and house washing I'm
saying no to to other Main projects you
know it's the the homeowner says oh well
you do this well do you do this I'm
saying no to a lot of that eventually I
do see this being being somewhat of a
bigger Home Care
brand I'm saying I've looked at gosh
I've looked at so many ideas whether
it's ice machines or Christmas tree
renting where you you you plant them and
replant them every year bring them back
I've looked at looked at doing the the
vertical horiculture in in cities and
City Skate where people can come and
learn and also you know you're already

[44:00]
learn and also you know you're already
looking at at areas that that don't have
access to the supermarkets and Fresh
Foods and trying to figure out how to
get you know planting and healthy food
into those areas uh at undercoating of
of cars for those of us in the Rust Belt
You Know It
uh my mind goes a mile a minute with
those things unfortunately never heard
of that tell me about Christmas tree
renting what is that business I saw that
somewhere I saw an article about it
where you know they you don't cut down a
tree you're taking a a live tree you're
taking it with a root bowl and all that
and you're you're renting it to someone
in a in their home and then at the end
of the season they give it back to you
and you can get that same tree year over
year over year I did not grow up with
that Faith but I saw my you know I saw
some of my neighbors they would buy a
new tree every year and they would plant
it along our property line and it became
a border but it was for me it was a neat
story where they would take that tree
and it would become part of their life
obviously you have people who live in in
town homes
condos that don't have that flexibility
that we had growing up on two acres of

[45:02]
that we had growing up on two acres of
land so how do you give them an
opportunity to get a fresh tree not have
to cut it down and then be able to to
know that they're they're providing well
for the environment so I saw an article
about it and was reading and I said you
know that that sounds really cool
obviously you have to have the land the
trees and and yeah that is cool that's a
cool concept though I wonder if you
could partner with a farm or something
and manage the all the logistics for
them I like it I might talk to one of my
neighbors
yeah someone's going to Spur me in that
direction yeah that's a podcast for
another day but thanks for planting that
that seed pun intended I was going to
say is that intended there yeah well
