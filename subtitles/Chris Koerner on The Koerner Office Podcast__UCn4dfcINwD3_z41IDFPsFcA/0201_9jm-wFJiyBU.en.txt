this is too good homeboy thinks he was
the first person to invent a business
called farming listen let me tell you
about the pig business cuz I've owned a
pig business here's how it really is it
sucks in fact quite literally it stinks
we had two pigs we live on three acres
out here in Texas and I have four kids
and we want to teach them the value of
hard work so we started a pig business
one day we had two pigs the next day we
had 13 because one was pregnant and it
gave birth what do you do with 13 pigs
I'll tell you what they do they escape
they get out they poop everywhere they
run all over the neighborhood and it was
the worst farming is hard Farmers don't
make money unless they own thousands of
Acres there's a reason that farmers have
to rely on subsidies from the government
to even pay their bills so if you see
something on social media that shows
farming to be sexy and awesome no it's
not you farm animals to teach your kids
a lesson not to make money unless you
own thousands of Acres or your private
Equity follow me for more business ideas
like this or go watch me on the ker
