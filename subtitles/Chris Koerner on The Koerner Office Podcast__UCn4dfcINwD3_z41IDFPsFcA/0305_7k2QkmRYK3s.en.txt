[00:00]
welcome to the ker office the show where
we discuss business ideas and Niche
business deep Dives today we are
learning about J&D Lake Services which
is a pond cleaning company which means
these guys literally went to Home Depot
and bought a garden rake and started
scraping the bottom of ponds for Rich
homeowners with 75% net margins before
these guys there was one type of pond
cleaning company one that would dump a
bunch of chemicals in a pond kill the
fish kill the plants and leave a bunch
of dead weeds then these guys showed up
and they said why don't we just pull the
weeds in the pond yeah it's hard it's
ugly it's sweaty but 75% net margins no
competitors is a good business that's
all I'm going to say these guys are
awesome they're college students and
they're crushing it and they're going to
continue to crush it enjoy please share
with someone that might benefit from
this
idea why don't you guys just start off
by telling me who you are and what you
do yeah I'll start I'm Joe Weinberger
I'm the Jay of J&D Lake services

[01:00]
I'm the Jay of J&D Lake services
and I'm a sophomore here at the
University of Nebraska in Lincoln and
yeah okay my name is dein obviously the
D of the j& D and I'm also a sophomore
but at the University of
Missouri okay so big football fans I'm
sure yeah some exciting games all right
so you guys as I understand were high
school buddies that started doing some
side hustles in the summer and then you
went off to separate colleges and then
you go home every summer and that side
hustle is now morphed into a pretty
good-looking business
right that's right tell us kind of like
we talked about yesterday tell us how it
all got
started yeah so pretty interesting we
were just kids and I actually had a
neighbor who called me up one morning
and he's like hey I have a lake house
that's a little bit far away but would
you be interested in helping install
this dock for me and so I'm like yeah
sure I mean you want to pay me okay and
so he said grab a buddy or two come meet

[02:03]
so he said grab a buddy or two come meet
me at my lake house and you know help me
install the stock and so what was he
paying you guys per hour it had to be
like 15 an hour something like that
pretty good for you know a couple of
yeah I'm just trying to set to create
some context around what we'll talk
about later yeah absolutely you know it
wasn't paying us much but for us it was
great so I called Dean my best friend at
the time still is and we went over there
and we basically just helped him install
the doc it's if you're installing docks
in the midwest it's very cold so we had
to put us in these waiters and we
basically just helped install the doc um
and afterwards we kind of looked at each
other and we're like there's a lot of
people on the lake who have this problem
and and need their dock installed and so
we said let's keep doing it any idea how
many people are on the lake for context
is it like 100 a thousand that specific
Lake I did count it there's a 74 homes

[03:01]
Lake I did count it there's a 74 homes
on on the lake that we started on so
it's a smaller Lake and some of the
properties have a little bit more land
and some are a lot tighter do the homes
surround the whole lake or like a
certain side of it yeah they surround
the whole lake the only Parts aren't
surrounded by the house of the public
beaches there's three main public
beaches and then some private beaches
which we've also cleaned some of those
beaches okay all right sorry Joe keep
going so yeah so we probably did maybe I
don't know 10 or 15 uh doc installs and
then we also took them out um in the
spring in high school and and it went
fine it was good it was hard work the
next year uh we had a woman call us up
and she said hey a little bit of a weird
request but I have some grandkids coming
over and I have all this seaweed around
my dock area would you be interested in
coming and removing this Lake grass and
seaweed and I was just like Hey Dean you
want to make some money you know and so

[04:01]
want to make some money you know and so
uh we said sure and so we end up we go
over to the house and she hands us this
interesting looking rake and she said
yeah just jump in there and you rake it
out and you just you put it on my Dock
and I'll actually have uh some people
take it away just get rid of the stuff
and so we spent the first four hours at
that house just pulling this stuff out
and for those watching on YouTube I'm
going to put up a bunch of pictures of
what this looked like right like I think
people it could help to see some context
like is it algae floating on the water
or is it weeds growing on the lake Floor
coming up all the way to the top
so yeah absolutely for this particular
client they had a ton of weeds that were
growing like on the bottom on the lake
bottom and so we spent probably four
hours there just pulling the stuff out
we were really inefficient looking back
at it but you know we did it and that's
same day Neighbors on both sides came
out and said hey we want you to come and
do our Shore area next keeping up with

[05:01]
do our Shore area next keeping up with
the Joneses that's right and so the
light bulb just kind of went off and we
said there's all of these people that
have these lake houses and everyone
deals with this problem no one likes
swimming off the dock and getting
covered in seaweed and so no one really
did it in our area and still does it and
so that's when we started this okay so
what were you charging hourly for this
first customer and how did that evolve
over time
so we started out just charging 20 an
hour for the jobs and like it it was
really good money at first it was pretty
much always only Joe and I going to
these Shor fronts and it was Twan job
and so we would charge 40 an hour total
but then once we started to take on
bigger jobs or try to take on multiple
jobs a day we needed to hire a crew our
rates aren't going to be the same we
can't all just be getting paid hourly so
then we started to try to find where
where we would fit like the accurate

[06:01]
where we would fit like the accurate
rate so we were just like how much money
would we want to be making and both of
us were like we want to be making $100
an hour and then we want to be able to
pay our crew guys 20 an hour because we
were doing the same work for $20 an hour
so then we would quote our jobs at
estimate how many hours it would take
and then go off of that and just do like
$240 an hour that so for both of us to
make a 100 and for our crew guys to be
making 20 okay and sometimes it would
take long longer or less so our
estimates were not always accurate but
overall we got pretty good at quoting
just being able to do a lot of jobs you
just know know how long it will take
when you see it yeah so I think this
part of the conversation is really
important because a lot of people out
there want to start a sweaty startup
like this but they have no idea how to
price right me as a homeowner I would
love for all of my contractors to charge
me an hourly rate I love that and they
hate that right they want to kind of
guesstimate a project working a bunch of
offer and say hey for these trees it's

[07:01]
offer and say hey for these trees it's
going to be three grand and I want to be
like how about 60 bucks an hour but it's
that's not best for them so I get it so
how did you come up with that $100
number did you talk to someone in a
different industry and and think wow we
could charge that or is that just a nice
round number we actually so we have a
pretty good friend he's kind of like a
mentor to us he's in a totally different
industry he's actually in the real
estate industry and we were telling him
about our business he's like I love this
you know it's really interesting it's
cool but he said when you're thinking
about in terms of charging how much do
you think you're worth what do you want
to be making and we're like well I mean
$100 an hour sounds pretty good and so
he said okay well if that is what you
want to be making then that's what you
have to charge and so just work that
into your price and so really how we
started charging around the lake is we
worked out that we were making around
like
$250 every single time we would go do a

[08:01]
$250 every single time we would go do a
client and so we literally just for the
first year of just doing the seaweed we
charged $250 an or $250 for everyone
flat fee no matter like how big the
radius was around the dock or was that
always the same no matter how much the
radius was we basically because every
single home on that lake has a very
similar um Shore area so that's why we
kind of worked out that price and
honestly for the first year it was
pretty good we definitely got burned on
a couple jobs that's how you learn right
yeah but that's how we learned and what
we really realized was it was great to
just say it was very easy to quote
because we said yep 250 but the problem
with that is that you have those certain
outliers that are way way more difficult
and like why did we charge
$250 for this are they outliers because
the weeds are much more dense or it's a
bigger area or there's a ton of

[09:01]
bigger area or there's a ton of
different kinds of weeds that we deal
with so we deal with weeds that grow on
the lake bottom and that's essentially
just us coming in and raking the bottom
of the lake but we also deal with
clients that have floating Wheats so
just Wheats that are already cut or
already dislodged and then they're just
floating in their Shore area and so it's
a different time frame to remove things
that are already floating than to rake
stuff and then we also found that
there's certain people on the lake who
have three lots and so you know that
ends up taking longer so we really
started to just mainly do more Project
based quoting we quote every job
differently now yeah and how did you
decide how big the radius should be or
was that up to the customer like what if
they want it 50 feet out from the dock
and what if they just want it five feet
out from the dock so that's why it's
really important that we quote in person
like we we do use Google Earth to be
able to take some measurements that's
primarily for pond
but it's important for us to go in

[10:01]
but it's important for us to go in
person and talk to the person who lives
there because even if they're not there
we'll send them a video or call them
because the price will differ we'll say
hey we can for 600 we'll clear out
everything or 300 Only The Floating
weeds and then they say like hey I only
want the floating weeds or whatever so
every time we're kind of working with
the client just so that they clean the
area that they want and they only spend
the money that they're willing to spend
so you were charging 250 per then you
realized this isn't work working what
was the big unlock to switching away
from 250 I think the big unlock was one
primarily that we we were starting to do
more ponds so we got exposed to making a
lot more money in one day focusing on
one job so then we realized that some
late jobs are just going to differ and
some are horrible and some people are a
lot more willing to pay than others so
if you're able to up your price a little
bit and have a couple fewer clients and

[11:02]
bit and have a couple fewer clients and
then cut out some of our jobs that
people that like we we actually have
very few people that are unhappy with it
but when you have your price too low
you're going to have people who are
barely willing to pay it and they're
going to not be happy with the smallest
little things that we already talked
about and you can't remove every single
piece of seaweed so a lot of people who
are willing to pay a little bit more
understand the aspect of that you can't
do a perfect job in here but they value
it being cleared out a lot more so then
we have a lot more like happy and
satisfied clients so it feels more like
a win-win tell me about the pond
business how did that differ and how was
that an unlock the ponds are interesting
because that is something that we can
charge a lot more for and we realize
that because the reality is we have so
in our Market uh basically there are
only a couple of other companies that
will do basically spraying or chemical
application to ponds so we're really the

[12:01]
application to ponds so we're really the
only physical removal where we don't any
chemicals and so like we would get
different referrals just from the lake
or actually Dean I know you can speak
more to this about uh the golf course
that you cadat but we actually were in
contact with a golf course and so we did
some work uh for local golf course as
well but what's great about those is
that a lot of people have ponds in our
area and in the midwest but not many
people
have much knowledge on how to control
them and so a lot of homeowners we
realize are kind of like we have this
Pond we want to swim in it or we want to
fish in it but it's just a mess and I
don't know who to call and so once we
realize there are so many people that
say yeah we have no one to call for this
kind of stuff uh we're like okay we can
really double down on this and so this
past season actually we just started
going door Todo to we would go on Google
Earth we'd find uh homes with ponds and
we just knock on the door and we'd say

[13:00]
we just knock on the door and we'd say
hey we have our own little business we
do uh Pond Grass and seaweed removal
we'd love to give you a quote on what it
would be to to help control your pond
and uh the responses have just been
amazing what percentage of those people
that you knock on their door cold
actually need work in their Pond versus
already have a clean Pond I I'd say that
it's a very high percentage that
actually need it
clean sometimes when a pond looks
absolutely beautiful we'll literally
just knock on the door hand them our
card and be like hey your pond is
absolutely beautiful I don't think you
need any work done but if there is
contact us but I'd say it's one out of
every 10 pounds doesn't need any work
most of them need work but some are
horrible I'd say most of them tend to
just need like cleaning up on edges or
algae and not like absolutely horrible
so there's no like insane projects but
I'd say majority of them do need work
done it's interesting because those
people with pristine pawns you might
think oh they're not austo but they are

[14:00]
think oh they're not austo but they are
like those are the people that care
about their ponds maybe the guy with a
disgusting gross Pond even if he has a
lot of money is not a good customer
because he doesn't optimize for that he
doesn't really care do you find that as
well people are like oh yeah my Pond's
terrible but I don't care yeah that's
actually very true our first Pond that
we got off of going door too was that
exact thing like they have a very nice
Pond there was some things that needed
touched up like there was branches along
the edges there some weeds just growing
up around but overall it was a pretty
good Pond and they do put time and
effort into it so they were lot more
willing to put more money into it and
they really appreciated when it was done
because they already have a lot of value
in their Pond all right if you are
watching this clip right now you are
watching this on YouTube and if you are
a fan of podcast please check out my
podcast while you're at it because
sometimes I have podcasts that aren't on
YouTube and sometimes I have YouTubes
that aren't on podcast so check out the
ker office on any podcast platform or
you can go to to TKO pod.com also my

[15:01]
you can go to to TKO pod.com also my
newsletter will throw that in there
there are no ads It's weekly it's
different content than my podcast and
YouTube newsletter. chrisj cerner.com
You'll see the link and we'll see you
there would you rather do a job that's
like disgusting but higher ticket higher
margin or something that's got quick and
easy in and out I'll go first on this I
would say disgusting and high margin
what I have learned because I've done a
bunch of different side hustles and what
I have learned is you know you can go
and knock on it on a house and hey I do
window cleaning and they're going to be
like I know 50 people who do window
cleaning I don't really care my windows
look fine but when you knock on
someone's door and you say hey I do Pond
Grass removal they take a second they
they take a step back oh really okay and
I want to know a little bit more about
this and so we have found that every
single time we go to a new home like
that and we offer our service people are
like amazed and they want they are want

[16:00]
like amazed and they want they are want
to help you and and I think it's such a
stark difference I mean we will watch
different door-to-door salesmen and try
to pick up little things you watch these
pest control videos and the guy's like
hey I'm with this pest control and
everyone's like I can't everyone's like
get off my Laine I don't I don't want to
see it but when we up get get back on
your little
hover right but when we come up there
they're like oh actually this is really
cool like okay yeah yeah it's funny we
have walked away I both Dean and I um
separately have walked away from homes
and clients have been like thank you
thank you for coming to my door and
knocking on my house even people with no
soliciting
signs like thank you for coming up here
and offering this I think yeah a lot of
these businesses are not cool they're
not like you know really nice and cool
up to watch or whatever but these are
the businesses that are need needed the
most so yeah that touches on a framework

[17:00]
most so yeah that touches on a framework
I have which is to sell something new in
an old way which is exactly what you
said like door knocking is very old like
that is not new but when your pitch is
different entirely it sells so well like
I I did a whole tweet about buying
Electronics door to-door to sell on eBay
it is door to-door sales but you're
selling them on the idea of buying their
electronics and you're say you going to
have to test this wipe it take pictures
of it list it on Facebook Marketplace
meet people up or I'll just buy it right
now and it sells so well because
nobody's doing that like nobody gets
pitched that at the door so when you do
knock it sells really well so I love
that you discover that on your own I
also love the framework here of there's
a selection bias at play like you get
such a positive response because a
there's a need for this B no one else is
fulfilling that need and C your customer
because of the fact that they have a
pond or lakefront property they can
afford a high ticket service so it's
just this perfect alignment of all these
things that no one is tapping into

[18:02]
things that no one is tapping into
except you guys seemingly so can you
talk about the difference between a pond
maintenance company that relies on
chemicals and what you guys do and what
the differences are yeah completely and
a a great example is the golf course
that we maintenanced so I caddy there so
I know the staff very well and I would
talk to them about we what we can and
can't do and what they were doing to
maintenance the ponds we would learn
from each other help each other out and
they went through like three or four
different chemical companies not
satisfied with any of them because the
chemical companies they'll come in
primarily one time sometimes they'll set
up maintenance plans but for most of it
they'll come in one time and they'll do
a spray have it was like a thousand
dollar a pond that they come in and they
they spray everything and it kills
everything and it stays in the pond
after it's killed so does it kill the
fish it doesn't kill the fish like there
there is some fish but primarily on that

[19:02]
there is some fish but primarily on that
course the the vegetation was killing
fish more than the chemicals but some
chemicals do kill fish like we even see
some of our competitors on their
websites in like hazmat suits spraying
chemicals into swim areas so there's a
lot of reasons why like the chemicals
are definitely not and it's hard to use
the same chemicals in different like
agricultures like every Pond is
different so when you only have like one
or two chemicals that you're using it's
not going to treat every Pond the same
way and we learned through going door to
door when we go up just to random
properties with ponds obviously they've
already tried to find their solution and
go with the chemical company and they'll
explain that the the chemical companies
aren't good with maintenance like they
don't check in they don't consistently
clean like they'll just dump the
chemicals in a spot and just hope it
spreads throughout like they don't
really Target
specifically like a swim area they'll

[20:01]
specifically like a swim area they'll
just dump the weeds and have it
maintenance the whole Pond and put it in
an air raater but a lot of people like
our business style a lot more that we're
a lot more present a lot more specific
to their exact needs rather than just
putting in chemicals to help the whole
Pond there's several reasons why people
have specifically told us that they're
not satisfied with the chemicals and how
next year they'd be very interested in
having us come with zero chem and rake
stuff out and see the difference
firsthand yeah Jeff Bezos likes to he
has a framework where he likes to build
businesses around consumer behaviors
first principles of things that will not
change right A lot of times we're
looking for like where's the puck headed
where's everything going AI this AI that
and Jeff Bezos is like people will
always want amazing customer service
they will always want their package
faster a lot of Trends come and go right
history repeats itself women liked baggy
pants in the 80s then tight panss now
baggy pants like a lot of things repeat
themselves like
hairstyles everything but some things

[21:01]
hairstyles everything but some things
are just the same and I don't Envision a
world where people are going to start
being like you know what I want more
chemicals in my
water everything's headed the opposite
direction but it's that's hard it's hard
to do it's like these other pond
maintenance companies have gotten fat
and happy by just spraying a hose and
and sending a thousand do invoice
because the alternative is much much
harder um and you guys are willing to do
that hard work which is why you're
successful yeah one thing I'll say to
that and why I think that a lot of
customers choose us over chemical
companies is because we have an
immediate result that we can show them
within minutes so a chemical company
will come out they'll say hey we're
going to spray your pond I know that
there's a lot of seaweed out you know
but guess what it's going to take a
couple weeks so we'll come back in a few
weeks and maybe it'll be gone maybe it
won't when they hire us we walk in we
say okay where do you want us to dump
this stuff okay and then we roll up and
we start pulling that stuff out
immediately and the client sees that

[22:01]
immediately and the client sees that
they're like oh they're actually pulling
this stuff out I see a real difference
like right now and when people see that
like immediate difference it's a big
factor for people yeah have you ever
heard of the painkiller and vitamin
analogy in business I don't I don't
think so a lot of people are looking to
sell a vitamin like all right this will
make you bigger better faster stronger
this will optimize your skin this will
yada y yada but painkillers provide
immediate an immediate fix right like I
have a real problem in my life my back
is hurting I take this pill and it
doesn't hurt anymore a vitamin is like
okay in 30 years maybe I'll feel better
okay maybe now there's still a business
for selling vitamins literally right or
for selling an e-commerce widget that's
a little better than the one before
that's that's a thing right people are
successful with that but when you have a
painkiller you get that immediate
gratification and people think of the
painkiller vitamin analogy as you want
to sell something that people really
really need but that's not all of it the

[23:00]
really need but that's not all of it the
other part of it is exactly what you
just said and that's the immediate
gratification the visual aspect of it
cannot be undersold okay so let's talk
about ticket prices how what are you
guys charging today and how do I know
you're quoting flat fees are you just
guesstimating all right this is going to
take a couple hours from us couple hours
from our two guys at our hourly rate
let's work in a little buffer is that
kind of how you're quoting and what does
the average ticket price look like for a
Lakefront proper or a pond yeah all that
yeah so our Lakefront jobs they range
pretty significantly so our cheapest
that we're charging now is about 250 to
300 and the most expensive shorefront
just one home that we did was a $1,200
job so they range pretty significantly
but I'd say we fall at about majority of
the time for lakeef fronts for Lake for
Lake and then what's your margin on that
it's pretty high because we only pay we
normally bring one to two guys which is

[24:01]
normally bring one to two guys which is
20 an hour and that's truly our only
expense for the lakefront because all of
our equipment's been covered for a while
and we just bring the same equipment
over and over afterwards most of those
will take about three hours so we're
paying 60 60 bucks to each guy per job
normally then we can fit in multiple
jobs a day so they can make a decent
amount but then for the ponds The Ponds
tends to be a whole day thing where it
will be about th000 to 3,000 and our
margins are going to change
significantly this past year to next
year because this past year we were
still using the same tools that we
didn't have to spend any money on and it
was just straight manual labor but now
that we have our new boat we are going
to be adding in an equipment expense for
every day which will be a minimum of
$700 a day of an operating cost so then
we'll have that plus our labor costs so
then our margins will be different and
we're not exactly sure what they're
going to be um so our prices may vary

[25:02]
going to be um so our prices may vary
but this past season a majority of our
highest pwn job was quoted at
4500 and the lowest I believe was 1,200
okay so let's say you got a $2,000 Pawn
job what was your net profit on that
this season vers next season with your
boat like just guess to me I know you
said you don't know exactly but what
would you guess it to be so my guess
that a $2,000 job would be about a 10 or
11 hour job so then we'd be paying our
guys4 to
$500 we'd be buying random stuff like
Waters or snacks on top of that and then
we would both be profiting or our
business would be profiting about 1,400
to 1500 of that 2,000 that's absolutely
outrageous 75% net margins on a sweaty
startup man that's like software margins
right that's unheard of all right so

[26:00]
right that's unheard of all right so
that's GNA be go ahead well and what's a
crazy percentage and why we love our
clients so much is we get tipped all the
time on top of our
rids like so it's really truly like we
make great profit and sometimes we can
give those tips straight to our
employees or add it to cover whatever we
bought in like food and snacks just for
that single trip but yeah it is pretty
crazy
so obviously the margin will drop when
you're out of the business but oh darn I
have 55% net margin instead of 75 oh I
better go you know apply for food stamps
but so is that margin on a job with your
boat next season or last season this was
this last season without the boat
without the boat what would it be with
the boat then you'll just add that $700
fee or we'll incorporate that into our
estimate and it will just be part of the
invoice and so instead of only a labor

[27:00]
invoice and so instead of only a labor
as the expense we'll just throw it in as
whatever it is on the operating cost
okay so you'll have like one or two less
guys but you'll have the expense of the
boat so it'll be about the same is that
yeah accurate there we'll still have to
develop like the systems for the ponds
we we think that we may have the same
amount of crew guys or maybe just one
less just to have every motion of like
the pond cleaning going smoothly The
Dumping the raking and just everyone on
the on the machine do you use any like
math or Excel formula to quote jobs like
I'm thinking like the radius of the pond
and the depth and the approximate
percentage density of the weeds or is it
just like we've been burned on this we
learn from that we know from this it's
just kind of like a gut feel eyeball
test yeah it is really like I I like
what you're saying because it would be
amazing if we could quote this like lawn
mowing or power washing hey it's 2,000
squ feet you know let's do it it's X

[28:01]
squ feet you know let's do it it's X
price we charge X price per square foot
but the problem is with the amount of
range of services that we provide within
this it's just too much to really give
someone a full like this is exactly to
the tea why it's going to cost this much
because we're removing floating weeds
removing Lake grass we're removing
Cattails and it takes longer and
sometimes Cattails are in the muck and
sometimes they're not in the muck and
you know sometimes people just want the
edges of their pond so it again I think
the first part is just being really open
with the client of hey what are you
looking to get done so we really do
spend time like in the consultation of
like what is your goal what do you want
and then they might want to leave The
Cattails right right right so that's why
every Pond is different we have a you
know specific custom price because what
we do is just there's such a wide range
like dein said we can estimate you know
we look at it we're like this is going

[29:00]
we look at it we're like this is going
to take us longer but we do put in a
pretty good buffer if I look at
something and I think oh that's going to
take a long time I'm gonna add maybe an
extra, 1500 because I want to make sure
that our guys get paid and that we're we
don't get burned on any jobs and that
just comes from learning so yeah so it
is hard to you know to specifically
price one I'm glad you said that I was
hoping you would say that like it's
really easy to have a spreadsheet and
let that rule your world but I don't
know I'm a gut Feld wish I wish that we
could do that and we've learned that we
always over quote we've never really had
too many people say no we we sit there
and I'll look at this Pond and be like
that's a $1,500 job all right we can do
this for 2,000 and they almost always
take it and we always leave that room of
comfort where we're not ever really
getting screwed over do you have any
idea what your close rate is like I I
think it would be very very helpful for
you to keep track of all of those quotes

[30:01]
you to keep track of all of those quotes
what your quote was what they said was
it yay or nay because over time you're
really going to get a good feel for
where that sweet spot
is yeah that is very intriguing we don't
know exactly what it is but we do know
we have a very high close rate because
it's so specialized to like targeting
homes that already have the pond you're
competing against them deciding if they
want to do it or not not with the next
competitor right yep but that's still
still a competitor that's still very
real right
like you might quote too high and they
can afford it but it's just not worth
that much to them yeah what we've found
is that this really is a pain point for
so many people and when you solve a pain
Point people are willing to pay whatever
if it's a problem that doesn't really
bother them I'm not going to pay for
that I'm not spending this much but we
have found is like you said we're
competing on whether they want to do it
or not so we given out prices before and
I've been like I remember when we were

[31:01]
I've been like I remember when we were
first starting there was one uh
particular client and they were like hey
can you do a discount can you do this
I'm like hey sorry it's 250 that's what
we charge and he's like how about a
discount I'm like no that sorry that's
that's what I'm gonna regret saying yes
to you I can already tell and yes that
too but then 10 minutes later he's like
all right come do it yeah so it it
really is like it is good to be in a
business where we don't have a whole lot
of competitors but a lot of people are
like well if I don't have them come do
it it's just not going to get done and
so it's like do you want it done or
not it is interesting also because
competitors come in different shapes and
sizes right like you don't have a
literal competitor but you're competing
with people deciding whether or not they
want to do it when I was in college
literally your age I had an iPhone
repair store and I was the only guy in
town for a while and so for a while I
was like I don't have any competitors
but then it was like oh my competition
is the fact that most people don't know
I exist like they have a broken iPhone

[32:01]
I exist like they have a broken iPhone
in their pocket but they don't know I'm
here yet that's a real competitor right
so now now that I realize that I need to
get in front of their eyeballs like not
just anyone's eyeballs but the people
with a broken iPhone that was kind of a
big unlock for me I'd love to hear hard
numbers so I I'd love to hear what
percentage of your business this season
do you think will be recurring next
season and what your revenue and profits
were this season yeah so for this one
basically this past season I believe we
had around 45 uh clients around there
that's doubled by now actually um but we
had around we did around 45 to to 50
clients and uh we had a around a profit
of around
$40,000 I would say months sorry revenue
revenue of around
$40,000 and profit would be around 30 of
that so it's a 75% 75% right like we

[33:02]
that so it's a 75% 75% right like we
were explaining it's a very high margin
business because we have almost zero
costs except for the fact that we pay uh
some employees to come in we were
working our time frame was pretty much
may like miday to Mid August okay so
three months yeah literally three months
and we did a little over $10,000 a month
doing this a little little side note is
we were even able to get jobs on
vacation just posted on our Instagram
story Northern Wisconsin and with an
Airbnb head us up and we made oh like
you you did the job while you were on
vacation somewhere else it paid for our
vacation oh man that's amazing yeah like
did you go to Home Depot and buy rakes
or what someone happened to have one we
found one that's the craziest thing yeah
we were got garbage bins other rakes and
went on vacation and she tipped extra

[34:02]
went on vacation and she tipped extra
because we were on vacation too oh my
gosh yeah am that was that's a funny
little Side Story we were up in uh
Northern Wisconsin and Dean go you know
we're up there we're just having a good
time we're at a little lake house and he
posts on our story hey just kind of for
fun hey J&D Lake Services is in northern
Wisconsin someone swipes up on it and
says hey I have an Airbnb could you
please remove this stuff for my guests
and we're like I mean why not we'll take
a look and we found a rake in the shed
of the place we were
staying and some garbage bins and we
went over there and we're like hey
normally we have a dump area but we're
GNA have to dump this on site because we
don't have our trucks or really our
equipment they're like yeah sure and so
we come in we spend two hours there I
think we made four 500 bucks four and
then she dipped 100 so
toal 500 bucks we there for two hours we

[35:01]
toal 500 bucks we there for two hours we
showed up with the
minivan and that was it we're like well
that just paid for our Golf and and
everything oh that's amazing you I call
the mih gene the make it happen Gene you
guys have it you either have it or you
don't I have people ask me all the time
they're like how did you build this
business I'm like oh I did this and
they're like oh I wouldn't even know
where to start it's like you just do it
like you ask Google now you can ask chat
GPT like you go to Home Depot and you
buy a rake well I don't even know what
type of specialized Pond equipment do
you need a rake you stand in the water
it's very cold and you rake the bottom
of the pond and then you put it up on
the deck and it's very heavy because
it's full of water and hopefully they
have a landscaping crew that can come
take it for you that's ideal if not it
kind of sucks you got out another
hundred bucks or two but you just
literally like a leaf rake that's what
you buy you buy a rake and you start
raking like what it's that yeah it well
it's not that easy the concept is but in

[36:00]
it's not that easy the concept is but in
practice it's very
hard so is that accurate yes it's very
accurate yeah most of our tools you we
literally already had or just bought
from Menard's or Home
Depot yeah it's like some guy just
looked at a rake and he's like what have
I raked a
pond that was you
guys yeah much we started out with
little garden RS oh have you ever found
anything crazy in a lake or a pond or
like just a crazy story around the
business yeah I mean we've had a couple
definitely one of the craziest things we
pulled out was a drone we were in
actually it was a golf course Pond we
were raking it out and as one of us was
like what is this thing we pull it out
and it's like a DJI like a $2,000 drone
just P right out of the water we're like
wow did it work no
I mean we found crate we found fishing

[37:01]
I mean we found crate we found fishing
entire fishing rods and fishing lures
and all kinds of stuff so much garbage
obviously and even other rakes we found
another rake in a pond what kind of
shoes do you wear do you wear like
waiters or and what did it start with
like you're rocking Crocs for the first
week and you're like okay this is not
going to work yeah that is a culmination
of years of learning the hard way we
started out where I think I honestly
we're probably in waiters at least at
least once just because we're like we
don't want to touch it it's nasty and
then we realized when it's 90° in
Northern Illinois I don't want to be in
waiters so we kind of went from waiters
to where we were either just wearing
bare like either bare feet or just like
Crocs or sandals or something but the
problem is those kind of fall off and so
we're like how do we find a shoe that
like stays on your foot doesn't get
little things in it um but it doesn't
make you so hot and so we found these
things called Dive boots make the this
is what divers wear you can buy them on

[38:00]
is what divers wear you can buy them on
Amazon they're like 30 bucks and they're
literally hug your feet right it's like
a little neoprene Boot and it goes up to
like literally like your calf basically
and it is perfect it's not hot but
doesn't get stuff in them and so we just
wear these little dive boots whenever we
go out so man okay so I want to talk
social media because you guys are doing
it well that's how I found you you have
15,000 followers on Instagram how many
on Tik Tok I think we're at about 2,000
right now on Tik Tok haven't been too
active and then a decent amount on
Facebook as well and I've been posting
YouTube shorts as well this is my new
thing so I'm posting the shorts too guys
there's there's no reason for you not to
post to all four platforms platforms
Facebook Instagram Tik Tok YouTube
shorts I keep everything under 60
seconds so I can I love you had the
million view video of like the rake
lines
right can you tell me about that video
and the backstory there so this was

[39:02]
and the backstory there so this was
actually one of the slowest climbing
videos like we didn't even realiz he was
getting a bunch of traction and then
just all of a sudden a video from a
while ago had like 900,000 views and
this is actually our number one client
we are at her house every single week
and we rake up the entire swim area and
it's just a little Rocky and primarily
Sandy and we leave it perfect every time
there's perfect rake lines
it it takes us about an
hour every week and yeah we just thought
it was really cool how like the sunlight
was going through the water and showing
the lines so I just quickly pulled out
my phone first go just videoed talking
about it pointed at it and was like
we're kind of like landscapers because
Joe told me he was like when you mow
lawn you go like half over where you
mowed before sometimes so then I was
like yeah we're like landscapers like
you go half over before and that's how
we made the video and so Joe kind of
gave me the idea and then I just did it

[40:00]
gave me the idea and then I just did it
and it was a super successful video and
it caused a lot of hate and a lot of
love which is always good well that's it
can't go viral without that yeah right
that just comes with the territory what
was the hate destroying ecosystems
you're hurting the fish habitat like you
you don't you're personally putting
you're personally putting straws on all
the turtles noses yeah and I love how
most people don't actually take the time
to see that we're in Northern Illinois
because everything we say seaweed
removal so then people in the comments
be like you can't do that in the ocean
and it's like yeah we're not like
honestly you need to do this is sounds
obvious but you you need to do more
polarizing videos like that like with
you need to invite more haters to your
feet lily pads cause the most hate
because people adore lily pads so when
they see us just ripping them out and
taking rip oh oh it causes a problem oh

[41:00]
taking rip oh oh it causes a problem oh
yeah good yeah you need to make videos
of Just you ripping them out like
violently throwing them to the shore
honestly like the Zoom closeup on the
lily pads like or like an underwater
camera like showing The Roots come out
of the ground right oh yeah that would
look cool and that would slap Joe made a
video about like lily pads being gross
and was it was like the throwing up
emoji yeah I think and like people just
hate that too it's just so funny well if
they lived on a lake and they had
grandkids that wanted to swim and their
deck was surrounded by lily pads they
would want them out too period yep you
need to get a drone and do time lapses
of your whole job like I know drones
only last 30 minutes in the air but like
you could pay a guy just to swap out
batteries every 30 minutes that would
crush on social media we just purchased
the Drone it was a little late into the
season we got it just before the boat
just so we could get get some footage of
that and everything but hopefully when

[42:00]
that and everything but hopefully when
we come back for a job and in the next
season we can get a bunch of really cool
Drone footage yeah I would also if I
were you I would when you do a job I
would quote it with this in mind offer
them like one or $200 off or back like
if you had Amazon gift cards in your
truck and say hey if you post a here's
here are the pictures I took them post
it before and after to social media and
I'll give you I'll give you a 100 bucks
I'm just working into your quote Yeah
nothing sells like before and after
pictures like that's why there are so
many successful weight loss drugs and
pills because it's all the before and
after pictures and it would also Crush
just on your channel too right like they
post them to their 300 followers and but
some of them are going to be potential
customers local customers and then you
post it just to your feed that's an
amazing idea and like what we've heard
too is like Facebook groups like if you
can get into Facebook groups and be like
hey it's hard you know if J&D lak
Services posts hey we do this you know
people are like yeah what super cool but

[43:01]
people are like yeah what super cool but
if an actual person says hey these guys
j& D came in and they did a great job
like people really pay attention to that
they do yeah we do that for our tree
trimming business it's a very systematic
process we don't just go in and start
posting like it is very thoughtful to
get like the algorithm on your side and
to get people on your side and then
eventually you start posting little
calls to action here and there and it
was actually so successful that we we
have an agency that we work with now
that offers this for other people
because it's Facebook groups are so
overlooked I would be remiss if I didn't
ask you about the boat story tell me
about the boat what's the story behind
it how much it costs that's an amazing
story so it's funny how that kind of
started we were actually at a job and I
got a call uh from he said hey you know
I've got a pond it's kind of near down
near Chicago um which is about like an
hourish away from us and could you come
take a look at it clean it and I was
kind of like yeah I mean I talked to De

[44:01]
kind of like yeah I mean I talked to De
I'm like yeah it's kind of far away but
hey let's just go take a look at it why
not we went down there and he had told
us that basically his grandson had found
us on Tik Tok and told him hey call
these guys so we go down there and and
we're looking at his pond and it's a big
big job and we're just like this is out
of our wheelhouse we told him like this
is too big and he's like hey I've been
seeing this cool boat it's like a weed
removal boat what called the we do boat
all this stuff and we're like just
laughing to each other cuz we're like
yeah this is our dream we want this
thing we always I have a video of it
saved in my camera roll from December
2021 it's like on your dream board like
you're manifesting it and so he brings
that up and this guy is an entrepreneur
himself and he was just like hey this
thing is so cool and we're like yeah we
we want to get it someday we're trying
he's like I love your business he said
it's no one's really doing it and I
think there's a lot of potential in it

[45:00]
think there's a lot of potential in it
he said what if I buy this boat and then
I'll just like rent it to you guys so
you guys don't have the debt I know you
guys are young you don't have the debt
but you can still use this boat and
build your business and if you want to
eventually buy it from me go ahead and
we're like okay so this is the jackpot
this is the best we met you 30 minutes
ago yeah and he's like okay he's like if
you want to do this we got to do this
soon because I know you guys are going
off to college this is like three weeks
before we go to college he talks to us
so he we're like okay we're going to get
it done today so we're in the car going
home and Dean is like calling the
manufacturer and is like hey can we buy
one of these boats and they're like oh
it's going to be a four- week lead time
and we're like we can't do that we leave
for college in four weeks no I'm sorry
ma'am we don't take no for an answer and
we're like we have a gentleman that's
willing to pay cash can you bring it to
us in two weeks and they're like okay
okay maybe we can get it done yeah cuz
how many of these do they sell every day

[46:01]
how many of these do they sell every day
right like not a thousand no rarely s
it's a six employees yeah okay and and
so literally that day we're making all
these calls we're trying to get this
done the gentleman that we were working
with and wanted to invest in us he's
like yeah tell them I'll pay cash I want
to get this done like this this guy
didn't mess around he stood on his word
wow and two weeks later the thing
arrives
so you only had a week to use it before
leaving yeah we had around a week and a
half and so literally I just both of us
try to get as many drone little drone
videos and everything we could of this
thing we just thought it'd be really
important we're like we have no idea how
this operates how it runs like it's so
important that we get used to it before
next season like have some practice know
the ins and outs of it before we get our
first job next season or have to have do
one more thing of like train ourselves
we got in a good amount of time riding
that thing Joe got a little bit more

[47:01]
that thing Joe got a little bit more
footage on it which was nice but then
we're also going to be going back not
this weekend but next weekend and
hopefully be doing a job with the wedu
and get some more footage and just fully
understand like how to use it and we
were lucky enough that that company
built us a new bucket a better bucket
than the one that came with it and they
are very Advanced with with their like
expertise of equipment and maintenance
so they're able to fix it and add things
to improve it and so they're excited
about it too that it's going to be a
really cool piece of equipment because
it has their own little special
attachments to it yeah do they work with
you pretty closely since you guys are
like young entrepreneurs like you you
could be a great success story for them
the company itself we do technically we
don't have any ties to you know we do if
you're watching sponsor us please we
don't now but we do we want
to you know we drive millions of use to
your
company but yeah that's something we're

[48:01]
company but yeah that's something we're
looking forward to doing in the future
it would be really cool if they wanted
to send us like a cool new attachment or
even like they have other different
types of boats like send us a boat we'll
test it out post about it you know so
that's a thing we love to do what do the
terms look like with the guy who paid
for it like is it a monthly payment did
it just sit for the offseason or what
does that look like it's through his
company he owns a lift and like
equipment rental company so it plays in
perfectly to what uh he does so that's
why his crew is so awesome because they
know everything about the equipment that
if we bought it on our own eventually
down the road we wouldn't know what to
do when it broke or if it leaked or
anything which it's really nice that
they're used to being around that
equipment a lot so they're the ones that
they're the ones that we do work with
and they're very helpful but the actual
we do company no they they do not too
much and what's intriguing is there is
there's another company that makes a
very similar boat who was trying to sell

[49:02]
very similar boat who was trying to sell
it to us through like they contacted us
through Tik Tok and everything and they
had
weedos and then they started to create
their own and they were trying to sell
it so that that was very interesting too
just to learn that there are other boats
out there that are similar and those
companies do know about us so there is
something that we could do there with
working with them or if they'd be more
willing uh to work with us than we do or
different aspects of that but it's just
nice to know that there are those
options yeah that's amazing this is just
like I'm very excited for this to come
out because it's just so many of my like
isms are in this like say yes to
everything the younger you are the more
you should say yes to unless it's drugs
don't say yes to drugs and you you did
that you're like hey can you help us put
in our dock yes hey can you clean these
weeds out of the lake I didn't know that
was a thing but yes like where would you
be today if you
like you know so say yes to everything

[50:02]
like you know so say yes to everything
work hard like don't be too proud to do
ugly hard work and just be curious like
what if we just like literally grabbed a
rake from Home Depot and started
scraping this Pond H what well what if
we just started knocking doors of people
that owned ponds based on what I see on
Google Earth hm like what if this what
if that like there's a whole world on
the other side of what if right and like
my whole career has been built on
answering that question like refusing to
not answer that question as soon as
possible the sooner you answer it the
sooner you will answer it because if you
just have the question and then you're
like oh I'll get ran into it later you
want to answer you have to do it then so
