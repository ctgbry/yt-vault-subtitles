look at this freaking thing right here
it's a portable photo room and they
charge hundreds to thousands of dollars
to rent it for hours or days at a time
you could build this thing yourself all
in for a couple grand these girls are
renting them out to friends parties
corporate events farmers market fairs
you name it why does this idea work
because people want instagrammable
experiences and that's exactly what this
provides and because of the fact that
most of the props are inflatable you can
move them anywhere you want to go if I
were going to start this business I
would scrape a list of every corporation
within an hour of me and just start cold
emailing people people better yet set up
shop outside their business and start
taking pictures of yourselves as the
employees walk in and then reach out to
them after they see that and your email
will be a hundred times more likely to
be answered I made the full business
plan for this right here
