welcome to the ker office you're going
to love today's episode I ran into this
guy on Twitter named Daniel and he
started a power washing business 12
years ago in northeast Pennsylvania and
he is a rock star he's been running this
for about 12 years it's a seven figure
business we talk super in-depth in
detail about power washing HVAC coils at
grocery stores and residential and new
business lines and the Home Service
niches that people could start this is

Sant at acquiring customers in creative
ways which you know I'm a sucker for
enjoy well why don't you start by just
telling us who you are and what you do
and where you from my name is Danny cron
hour I'm from northeastern Pennsylvania
I was supposed to be a gym teacher and
it never worked out so didn't make it
and I end up starting a a roof cleaning
soft wash business had some success with
that was making some bucks that I was
like should I like can I retire and like
just set on autopilot and really geared
towards lifestyle of like not clocking
in you was able to have some free time
and also some money to kind of play
around and then I realized like yeah it
wasn't enough money so I wanted to do
something else and I wanted to scratch

[02:01]
something else and I wanted to scratch
my hometown had a gym the gym failed and
so I started calling the guy like
researching why fail talking to get his
personal Insight that my brother and I
physically built the gym then caring for
employees I started a Christmas lights
business now I have a little bit of a
construction company that I was just
working on before we jumped on the call
here okay so what got you to start the
first roof washing business and how big
did that get what were the numbers like
I was a substitute teacher trying to
make it and and I was actually
playing Diablo I which by the way oh no
that's my favorite dude Diablo I was me
in high school a like 2003 four five
like I had a barbarian named gub tesley
Necromancer like oh man you g be best
friends so this is why you go back to
like before we were recording I said
like people want to hear about you
that's amazing I don't know if you give
it credit I give it credit Diablo I
creat created the business person I am

[03:01]
creat created the business person I am
today yes my dad was like hey I need
your help cleaning the roof and I have
I'm the oldest of of four my sister's
graduation party was coming up and he
wanted to clean our a roof for the party
first off like who looks at their roof
second of all whose roof's dirty and
none of that makes sense and so I'm like
sure so I come outside he has like a
Breaking Bad setup it's a kitty pool
filled with chemicals running through
our old Power Washer and our ladder at
the time didn't even reach the roof so
our ladders against the house and I'm
like holding the power Watcher above my
head and he's telling me where to aim
and uh so I sprayed the pole roof I came
down off the ladder I did you not by the
time I got down off the ladder the roof
was clean I was like wow like that was
really impressive it was extra impactful
because you couldn't see it being clean
you were Flying Blind I Wasing BL like a
before and after like you you performed
it before and after but you weren't able
to see it in the process that's exactly
what happened and was blown away so I

[04:01]
what happened and was blown away so I
was walking around my my my parents read
with my parents I was walking around
their neighborhood so I was probably
like 22 and I recognized a bunch of
these houses like had this problem I was
like wow like I couldn't stop looking at
it you I like hit a mailbox by accident
cuz I when I was driving I'm like
looking at all these roofs so well
manicured houses great Landscaping
houses are taken care of roof looks
really bad like you know a $400,000
house with a $400 looking roof and so I
kind of got into that started reading
forums back when forums were a thing
figure out how people took care of this
what it was researching all about it and
my my dad had an engineering background
so he helped us put together our first
like Breaking Bad once again rig that
just looked like it came from a meth
trailer we did another roof that we knew
and the problem was there was a thing
called lyen l i c hen that didn't come
off you see that in like Seattle where
it's like high moisture areas right yeah
so I'm not sure you'll see it on like
rocks or trees here like it kind of

[05:01]
rocks or trees here like it kind of
grows kind of everywhere yeah some
people equated to like a good air
quality but I'm I'm not exactly sure why
moisture definitely is a thing but um
the Lykan didn't come off so first like
three months I was like panicking like
oh this sucks like all the black streaks
are gone the roof looks really good but
they have this bird poop on there right
that's exactly what it would look like
and then sure enough it came off so
after actually took I'm not sure if you
have this background too it' be funny Co
sales you coo knives I know it but no I
never did it myself so checking all the
boxes did you you sell religion door to
door too that's what I did no that I I
could be further from that okay well
that was my equivalent of Cutco door to
door yeah exactly that was your
equivalent of Cutco and what that was
for you was just getting over rejection
right the fear of rejection is gone
checked out of the chat and so CUO
taught me like cold calling and
following up with people I didn't know
going to pre present at their house like
these are all things I was able to sell
to people and and so I really I knew the

[06:01]
to people and and so I really I knew the
product love cut knives I had them grew
up with them in my house so easy to sell
I literally took my Cutco training book
I opened it up and the first thing they
had was a picture of the Cutco building
with American flag and I'm like what is
this page doing this page is
establishing rapport with the customer
right they're American company they're
brick and they're actual real so I
planned my business um later that that
week after I cleaned that the first roof
with the CU sales book and I just took
the CUO sales book I'm like what are
they doing in this page what are they
doing in this page the next page was
their complete Homemaker set it was the
biggest most badass you know thing they
had or actually the second page was a
drawer of knives that was like
completely distraught like it looked
like someone just dumped them from
Salvation Army and they weren't taken
care of it wasn't pretty wooden handles
that were like growing bacteria on them
uh they're showing the problem that the
customer was going to have and then the
next page of course is how we're going
to fix that problem so I didn't reinvent
the wheel I just took cuto wheel and

[07:01]
the wheel I just took cuto wheel and
apply it to Apex softwash and and how
we're going to sell and perform and do
leads it was good so you started going
door too with those principles postcards
mailers flyers door too all of it yeah I
really uh I tried everything as far as
advertising goes to see what kind of
work built a website it's really
important at the same time uh I was kind
of the unemployed teacher I worked uh
for a guy who had a medical uh surgical
equipment company and my job was to like
build out his Google AdWords for him so
I was studying how that worked at the
same time of launching the business and
so I just knew like he would walk in and
there would be orders on his desk that
just automatically got printed from
somebody who hitting the Smit button and
really knew how important a website was
for just selling at 24 hours a day seven
days a week 365 so yeah I got the
website up and running of course it
looked terrible cuz like first one I
built but yeah the roof cleaning
business as quickly as I got into roof
cleaning I knew that it was going to be
flooded with
competitors so I wanted to see what else
I could do to diversify that or get into

[08:01]
I could do to diversify that or get into
more of a niche market because I mean I
was a 22y old kid who started roof
cleaning business in like two weeks and
I knew I was the first person in my area
to do it and I just knew it was a matter
of time before people cut on to how good
this really was that they were going to
start doing as well what were your sales
like the first year or two we did about
a hundred grand the first year was I was
50 roofs and uh
so Y which was great you know it was but
it got me the confidence to explode and
like really like understood that this
concept worked it was a $2,000 service
no it it would it would vary like so one
50 roofs okay we did about 50 roofs yeah
and then we added some house washing in
there as well some gutter brightening
you know things that once we were there
for whatever that call would be we could
add on Services you to that and then I
got into like commercial power washing
this is a one I I love which I I
advocate everyone to do this I sold the
service before I had it so I service all
the time sell it before you have it sell

[09:00]
the time sell it before you have it sell
before you have it yeah so I want to get
a hot water power washer they're like
seven Grand but I always took money
which I think is important too any money
I had I I paid myself the least I and I
don't pay myself first I know it's a
book people talk about that I'm like
dead last I want to make sure my people
can eat first and everyone else and I
will just live off of whatever is left
over so yeah you wasn't we had a good
year but of course I was spending a
bunch of money on postcards and and
advertising because really no one had
any idea what roof cleany even was in my
area it was a Brand New Concept so I was
kind of spending a lot of money
educating but it bought a snowplow that
year so I had something to do in the
winter time then next year rolled around
bought a better rig for for roof
cleaning and then you know just
constantly you know reinvesting money
back into the company but I wanted that
hot water power washers so I went in
door too I went to a restaurant and sold
them a you know power washing that you
needed the hot water to do it so they
said yep called the guy up bought the
power washer put the back of the truck
and you went and did that job
unfortunately
the line they put on to that unit was

[10:03]
the line they put on to that unit was
like an 80 psi line or 40 PSI line and
needed to be like a 200 PSI line so that
line happened to be a diesel fuel that
exploded all over me so I was it was
like 7 a.m. covered in like two gallons
of diesel and I remember my employee
like yelling at me being like what are
you doing of course he's also my friend
at the time meaning like everyone hires
their friends
um he but it really was like my like
click in my head moment that that person
was going to be stuck in their way and
like I never would be because I was
doing something I've never done before
I'd never cleaned we did hundreds of
roofs at this point you know roofs were
easy for us they make very money good
margins but I was okay with failing or
doing a bad job or whatever to figure
this out that's how you learn learn
right so he like lost it because like
the job was not going well I'm covering
diesel fuel and I'm like yo it's okay

[11:01]
diesel fuel and I'm like yo it's okay
we're good you know we're we're going to
figure this out we're going to learn
what's going on called the guy up told
my line exploded he told me just pinch
it shut or put a screw in there to so
it's not bypassing anymore and we got
the job done and then the hot water unit
led to me getting contracts with
Walmarts and doing other jobs and
making 100x that power cost you know how
how did you get a job with Walmart those
religious guys they're good people so I
met a I met a family who two brothers
John and Tim who were part of like a
religious commune and like their dad was
like the head dude like they didn't have
bank accounts so they were like 20 maybe
30 years old because the religion took
care of all I'm not sure if you never
familiar with that I don't know but I
met these guys at a event powering event
and guy asked a question anyone do work
for Walmart and only two guys raised
their hands and it was these two these
two dudes and I went and talked to them
afterwards and asked them how they got
in and they became friends with them
they were great people and still friends
with them to this day and they they
showed me like how to do it it and it

[12:00]
showed me like how to do it it and it
was definitely one of the hardest things
I did in my life was to complete their
like vendor packet to become a Walmart
vendor there's so many requirements and
limitations like it's easier to do work
for the federal government than it is to
do work for w like Walmart a lot of red
tape oh so much and that I I believe 90%
it's there just to take out the bums
from even applying you know yeah but
which is great like the like in my head
the more I see that red tape and
friction the more I I want to power
through because it's like no one's going
to get through this no one's going to
get through that all the more reason I
need to right yeah ex and that was kind
of how I felt too like I knew that
Walmart was a possible golden ticket so
then I started to have to to sell which
they gave me like almost like the
instruction it's it's funny actually I
didn't at the time know they gave me the
instructions that the Walmart employee
was supposed to use because somebody
they knew figured it out and the Walmart
employe didn't know how to do it like
the Walmart employ like I don't know how
to put me in put you in the system and
I'm like here you go like this is this
is how you do your job and so I was able

[13:02]
is how you do your job and so I was able
to to clean a couple Walmarts on a nice
monthly basis because I also wanted to
get that that that reoccurring Revenue I
was always attracted to that doing roofs
was great how much revenue were those
jobs Walmarts we would do their
storefronts for $1,000 each and then I
had seven of them at the time and then
we do their bathrooms like that was kind
of the way in they told me like all
these man so interesting Walmart only
has two bathrooms front and back right
they they don't have a private bathroom
for the manager they purposely make
their managers use the same bathroom as
the as the customer keep it clean keep
it clean so the the when I was told was
go in and say you'll clean their
bathrooms too and so we' same equipment
we'd power wash the storefront with and
we'd also like their concrete outside
and we'd also go into there's usually a
door right in the middle of Walmart to
get to their their front bathroom and
then their door around the back to get
to the back bathroom so power wash their
their bathroom so that came out about
$1,800 a stock
and we'd have seven of them that we do

[14:01]
and we'd have seven of them that we do
on a monthly basis wow so talking 12
Grand a month recurring predictable just
from one client yeah Walmart are great
yeah what are the margins on that like
that job specifically I'm glad you said
that specifically because margins power
washing varies a lot based on what what
job you do Walmart doesn't allow to use
chemicals like it's against Walmart's
policy like they don't want get burned
so it just water free gas and gas and
labor there so w the Walmart margins are
at least 50% a job like that wow that's
beautiful yep and then probably our next
biggest break was a guy who worked for
me doing sales he knew another guy who
had a large company in the area and this
guy knew that we had power equipment and
they had a contract with Wawa to do
their HVAC so it's December which is not
the time to do this power washing work
it's 21 degrees we drive to this Wawa to
clean condenser coils so every grocery
store every refrigeration unit every AC

[15:01]
store every refrigeration unit every AC
unit they have these condenser coils and
they really need to be clean once a year
I had no idea what I was doing the guy
at the time was a technician Rob he met
me on site go start up the engine it's
Frozen I like it l it was 21 degrees
like but they asked me to do the job so
it's like you say JUMP we say how high
you know that's kind of how we we roll
he took a torch thought out our pipes
yeah got us up and running and we able
to to power wash these coils on on these
uh the ice machines the AC units on
these Wawa so WWA had some extra money
at the end of the year like hey just go
spend it on whatever so they called us
to do it all right if you were watching
this clip right now you are watching
this on YouTube and if you are a fan of
podcast please check out my podcast
while you're at it because sometimes I
have podcasts that aren't on YouTube and
sometimes I have YouTubes that aren't on
podcast so check out the ker office on
any podcast platform or you can go to
TKO pod.com also my newsletter will
throw that in there there are no ads
It's weekly it's different content than
my podcast and YouTube newsletter.
chrisj cerner.com you'll see the link
and we'll see you there it worked out

[16:01]
and we'll see you there it worked out
pretty well like this is great like
water gas like that's it like no
chemicals like go ahead and spray were
you only spraying the coils or we're
only spraying the coils that's crazy are
there companies that only spray coils
yes yes there might be two I know in the
Northeast I know but they kind of travel
all over did you see that being an
opportunity like hyper Niche power
washing yeah it's actually all I focus
on it's the best yeah that's amazing you
know I I made money power washing right
I could control my own schedule like I
quickly got into the niche right like
into that selective type work which is
coil cleaning you can't go clean coils
because you don't know what you're doing
and if you mess something up it's gonna
cost you a lot of money so that same
company who we did work for we did a
good job they call us a next spring like
hey um you want to watch some more coils
and we're like yeah like absolutely that
was the best work we had and then um
started to try to identify more
refrigeration companies who we could get
in with and do some more work so real
quick what are the unit economics like
on on a coil job like that how long does

[17:02]
on on a coil job like that how long does
it take how much do you charge now we
watchh coils all over at this point but
primarily we're washing them at grocery
stores so think of an actually we use it
for example of a book Aldi's people know
Aldi familiar with an Aldi's size of
them about the same we would
get 350 per store for an Aldi that's how
much 350 bucks there's a reason that
number is low all these are all built
the same
we know
exactly standardized like standardized
just saves so much time for our
employees like they they can close their
eyes and know right where the ladder
access is how to shut the unit down
right like all that stuff and best part
of it happens every year so as soon as
the pollen hits it gets sucked up to the
coils coils are dirty they have to have
it done so we know is the need greater
where you are because of the pollen or
is this Nationwide just as much demand I
would think it's probably just as big if
not bigger in the south because I'm
assuming they still have pollen or like

[18:01]
assuming they still have pollen or like
we do some work in Ohio they have like
Cottonwood this area has this Cottonwood
problem and just it just sticks right to
the the the unit I should have preface
with I was on a snowboard trip last year
I was screaming playing volleyball so I
lost my voice that's I I don't smoke I
don't smoke packs a day swear yeah
you're good so 350 bucks for an Alan and
how long does that take about 2 25
minutes wow that's amazing that's cuz we
know what we're doing right yeah but
then we might have like a think okay
Sam's Club right might do a Sam's Club
and probably get like 1,800 for their
refrigeration and maybe another $1,000
for their AC so they'll have the
refrigeration for all their coolers
right and then they'll have their AC
units that they might be on the roof or
on the ground some of them these are on
the ground it's even better Walmart has
these they're called rack we call them
rack houses they're just it almost looks
like someone dropped a trailer and it's
all their compressors and their their
units like on top of it and they would
be between 1,00 18800 typically we don't
use chemical there might you might like
a it's almost like negligent it's like

[19:00]
a it's almost like negligent it's like
60 bucks 50 bucks worth of chemical on a
job but just travel and labor beautiful
just yesterday I sent an email out to a
company to say like hey like this is
what we do and the best part about this
Niche is that every HVAC Refrigeration
company will tell you the same thing
that they don't have enough techs they
don't have enough guys so my
conversation usually goes like this hey
we have guys and rigs built to coil
cleaning you don't have guys sub out the
cleaning to us is that who's normally
doing coil cleaning or HVAC companies
and not power washing companies it's
typically like the green horns of HVAC
and they hate it the HV guys are like I
went to school to work on stuff and and
build it out and and and redo this and
they're making me clean these coils and
they're they're cleaning coils with like
a garden hose and just a bad setup and
you know we've kind of fine-tuned that
to to really clean them fast you or like
we do a building it's probably 3,000 ft
long like they don't have G no like they
can't do it they're no near the water
like your pressure drops on a water hose

[20:01]
like your pressure drops on a water hose
after like 50 ft imagine after 5,000 ft
you know so so this is a a B2B business
but you are you even approaching the
Aldi of the world are you only
approaching the HVAC companies or the
refrigeration companies that service
Aldi or do you go to through both of
them it's typically the HVAC company Who
services I have done both and haven't
had success going right to the customer
it's better to go right to the HVAC
company because the HVAC company kind of
controls who works on it the incentives
are more aligned there too cuz you're
saving them money like you're saving
them time whereas when you go to ALDI
like you're selling you're just another
sales guy yeah exactly yeah I know it's
it's it's an easy sell to an H company
yeah that's beautiful I think I know the
answer to this but is there any world
where this could be a a a residential
service that you offer coil cleaning no
people have asked it before as like a
preventative maintenance like you know
yeah no they it absolutely should be
done on residential and I've had people
ask before well I meant why I said no I
meant because of logistics like and
something I do I like my skill set is

[21:01]
something I do I like my skill set is
they'll give me 180 stores like hey
Danny here's the year's list go get them
done and there's 110 of those are Aldi
right and say go go wash these stores
and my job is to plan that out and
coordinate that yes somebody like you
know Chris Hoffman who has a thousand
customers he might say hey Danny like
here's a thousand customers go clean
their clothes and he might sell it for
150 and then pay me 100 right and we
just pull up and go do it so is a
residential deed for it yeah that's a
really good example I had someone ask me
about residential and my answer was like
it's not worth it for us you just
because of I know well you're already at
scale but for a guy that's never done
this before that could be one route like
I'm comparing this to like trash bin
cleaning 10 years ago is there is there
a business for cleaning someone's
Trashman like no like why just because
it smells like once a month like no it's
like it never fails to surprise me what
people are willing to pay for yeah and
and your coils should be done but it
goes back to your HVAC gu is probably

[22:00]
goes back to your HVAC gu is probably
going to control that so how often do
you have your HVAC guy come to your
house almost never because I'm almost
never right and I don't know if that's a
good thing or a bad thing the hvat
company can easily add a bunch of money
say hey like Chris you want your AC to
work more efficiently you should have
this done every year yeah and that's a
sell you're gonna decide yes or no to
that if someone were attacking the
residential side of this would you
recommend that they go through HVAC
companies just as you're doing with
commercial companies yeah because some
of these a companies will have like pmep
PR maintenance packages with these
homeowners and they'll ask like they
like their contract says that they doing
it and that's exactly what's happening
commercial the contract said they're
doing it and they weren't doing it
because they did not have enough guys so
like interesting and the unit would
break down and the company would go fix
it but it it it comes from their their
bottom line there and so like sometimes
they don't want to do it but you know
contractually they're obligated to do it
and for them it was really easy for us
to say like yeah just go have these guys
do it you taking some off your plate is
just as valuable as is hiring a new

[23:00]
just as valuable as is hiring a new
person for this company is the
non-standardization of it a challenge
you know I mean how many different HVAC
units are out there you or is it more
simple so it doesn't matter as much as
it does in commercial with residential
it's very easy just unplug it yeah
that's what I'm talking about
residential residential yeah very easy
residential okay once again comes to
seasonality the the problem with coil
cleaning is it has this window it's a
March through July window really March
through June that you kind of get this
stuff done because you want this unit to
work efficiently as possible in July
heat or August heat or you know where
for Pennsylvania when it gets really hot
you don't want to do it in February
because the pond hasn't happen yet right
so there's a little bit of a window
there you have to deal with which makes
scaling a little harder and trying to
work hiring people to do it in a certain
window is the tough part but then you
have ways to fill that in we we could
talk about power washing for forever but
yeah as far as coil cleaning I could
look it up but we probably do between
and 500 600 maybe of coil cleaning 600

[24:02]
and 500 600 maybe of coil cleaning 600
Grand yeah yeah dang that's amazing and
the best part is it comes around every
year so like you I used to sweat like
just having roof clean to
do because it wasn't recurring really
right no recurring no it's 12 years old
so like the business has some clout you
know people know us and recognize it now
but um for a while like you I'd sit here
on January 1st and look at myself like I
have no money yeah I I don't know I
don't know I have no idea I don't the
economy goes bad whatever I I I have no
idea how much work we're going to do and
now with with the coil cleaning I can
pretty much predict like we're gonna
have 500 600 Grand with a coil cleaning
you know again or or more you know
because I'm gonna start hammering more
more companies or we're going to expand
further south or west you whatever we
start doing we actually did a bunch of
work in Ohio last year six- hour drive
no problem we the company who we which
is also a great way to look at things I
think you could kind of relate to Bucky
success like just ride the coattails to

[25:00]
success like just ride the coattails to
somebody else this other company kept
growing expanding their footprint and
they're like hey Danny you guys are
coming with us like we're going North
Carolina we just opened a branch up we
don't want to hire a new guy for 80
grand so you guys just do it we'll pay
you 25 Grand yeah
and like perfect where we going next you
know and so many people would be like no
we don't nah no but like you uncover
beautiful things when you just say yes
to things and you can always back out
later right but just say yes to
everything yes yes to opportunity is is
like a advice I definitely give people
say yes to opportunity so so your
current business started as a
22-year-old just washing roofs and then
you just started exploring then you
started doing you know storefronts and
all kinds of stuff then you landed on
coil cleaning and coil cleaning is not
everything but now you essentially still
have the same business today but you're
doing all kinds of different Services
yeah so I still have a residential
branch which I called the
Division and it's just um like three

[26:01]
Division and it's just um like three
guys who who who run that they're
talking about adding another truck this
year because they were kind of
overwhelmed um but so they might have
five guys over there just do Residential
cleaning they'll do 300 to 350 of
residential cleaning a year so similar
long lines of rolling Suds that's that's
accurate information they're given and
then commercial wise about four trucks
to text each truck and we'll do gas
station coil cleaning water towers so
actually just great networking and Med
guy who was in charge of of these water
towers I'm like yo they're so dirty he's
like yeah I know but I need someone who
could clean them and red tape to work
for a utility company you have to like
really have your stuff together they
can't just pick up Joe's power washing
from so I most of My Success has come
from making power washing a legitimate
business right and people look at Power
Washing as like a Home Depot guy right
and they don't want Home Depot guys they
want a legitimate business and we like
100 feet tall 80 feet tall 60 feet tall
all different tanks we think we didn't
last year we didn't do too many but the

[27:00]
last year we didn't do too many but the
year before we had about 11 different
sites that we did these things for and
this is for a water company but like
every state has water companies right so
now I'm like oh well do them for Aqua
America why not do them for you know New
Jersey America or whatever you know
might be and they just pay such better
rates like I I I really love the saying
like don't compete dominate I don't I
don't compete because competing is down
here right I just dominate I go to this
level where it's very few players are at
right and there's so much more money at
the top than there is at the bottom no
one competes to be the highest price
they're all competing to be the lowest
yeah and I'm just competing to be a
professional power washing company and
there's very little professional K power
company out there what does a a water
tower job pay and how long does it take
they quote between six to 122,000 per
Water Tower and yeah around a lift lift
might be 800 to two grand depending on
the size of the lift and we could do
them in a day wow and beautiful there's

[28:00]
them in a day wow and beautiful there's
some you know bleach involved so maybe
$200 worth of chemical $100 worth of gas
and then just labor and profit that is
water towers are really so I'm I'm
really started to focus more on on those
higher higher margin higher dollar stuff
we did I I had Turkey Hill is a gas
station near where we are in
Pennsylvania there's 240 turkey Hills in
Pennsylvania and I put a bid together to
to bid all the turkey Hills and I got
the bid and the guy calls me up say hey
can you take any any more and like well
you have he's like well I have 500 more
across like the island Connecticut
Massachusetts so you know where this is
going I said yes and so I'm like sure
and then he like gives me the work and
he left out Pennsylvania I'm like like I
said yes to to Massachusetts and New
York and all the Connecticut because
we're gonna do Pennsylvania too backal
yeah he's like oh yeah all right so then
he gave me so I had both yeah I so we we
did it was two years ago we had 700 gas
stations and which sounds like a lot and
definitely was but the reality is gas

[29:01]
definitely was but the reality is gas
station work sucks like the margin I
might make a $100 a store why because it
takes so long no because the it is such
a squeezed like it's you're they're just
yeah they have low margins so they push
that on you that's it and you my sales
guy said to me he goes look the reality
is the person doing this bid and making
this decision is in wherever Connecticut
and
they are not going to lose their job
because of a dirty Turkey Hill in
wherever Pennsylvania and the only thing
they would lose their job for is going
over budget this is exactly thing
happened to me the guy said my quote for
a store was
$800 and the other quote came in at like
450 the guy calls me he's like hey just
so you know like someone else said they
do it for 450 bucks and I'm like per
store 450 450 per for gas
passation and I'm like there's just no

[30:02]
passation and I'm like there's just no
way it's possible and he burst out
laughing cuz he knew it he knew there
was no way it was possible but he's like
look you're either gonna do it for 450
or I'm giving to this guy yeah we'll do
it for 450 and I told my guys start
o'clock when it hits one hour leave and
wow okay that's yeah that's the battle
you're fighting with with a certain
company's gas stations now I've done
other gas station companies which are
have much more Pride there's no you
homeless people sleeping in the backyard
or in the dumpster or whatever and like
they paid a lot more money it was it was
good so it's a different game depending
on who you're playing with so that 450
is it one or two guys doing that job in
and out two guys okay and there's some
turkey Hills we did in 15 minutes yeah
and what do you pay your guys like what
is your labor cost on a 450 so I always
pay my guys a an hourly rate in a
percentage that's CU I was taught that
way I I had a coach I hired for a day
and that's what he kind of said that he
did and he successful powering you know
company and I always kind of said to

[31:00]
company and I always kind of said to
myself like yeah no one wants to work
just for an hourly r that sucks like you
want have some kind of vested you know
interest in in the job so they would get
like lead tech would get 5% assistant
Tech would get 3% then you know once
again the lead tech or the assistant
Tech kind of do what they're doing they
would get that that 5% and so right off
the top I was paying out 5% to each Tech
based on the job so they love it too
because we get a a water tower job and
they're like let's go we're making good
yeah we're making I mean these guys can
made $100 an hour you know then there's
some jobs they make make 22 they always
have like that that base pay of $20 or
21 22 between 17 and and 22 hourly you
know rate and then that percentage on
top based on their experience and okay
what they bring to the table yeah all
right so when did you start doing
Christmas lights I started doing
Christmas lights probably about eight
years ago and I kind of sold the
polishing business uh to one of my
employees and sold the business and the
Christmas lights cuz that was a
residential package kind of together I

[32:01]
residential package kind of together I
was only doing Chistmas lights for
probably two years at that point so I
only had a few customers and then it
just worked out the guy who I sold it to
he started making
money does didn't not handle money and I
got the business back he screwed it up
he screwed it up yeah yeah he was making
good money and some people can't handle
money and that's that's what happened
and so I got the business back and we
got the business back I really like
hammered down Christmas lights took the
Christmas lights from like 12 customers
like 250 customers and wow again
Christmas lights re reoccurs and there's
nothing better than reoccurring Revenue
I can tell you next year we'll do
$450,000 of Christmas lights and it is
it's amazing okay remember come back in
one week from today and we'll play part
two and that's the part where we really
dial up the energy and get super
specific about acquiring customers and
other Home Service niches that really no
one's thinking about or talking about
