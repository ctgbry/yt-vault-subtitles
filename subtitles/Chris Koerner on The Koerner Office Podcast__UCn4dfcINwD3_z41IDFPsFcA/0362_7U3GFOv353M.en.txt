look at this freaking guy right here I
just found a new business model where
customers spend $5,000 a year and they
never leave recurring Revenue operates
anywhere huge Market size and almost no
competition let's break this down and
then I'll tell you what it is this
business enjoys sticky repeat customers
because convenience they love never
thinking about this again startup costs
are minimal especially if you lease a
truck you need a 400-gallon tank and a
pump an app handles all the scheduling
and payments part of this idea is
servicing vehicles but the real cash cow
is boats boter hate hauling fuel to the
lake and dealing with lines Coast
markets are a massive opportunity
because one Marina contract could be
worth a 100 Grand a year or more other
markets include residential Vehicles
fleets generators construction
equipments you have two revenue streams
$24 a month per vehicle and then you
charge by the gallon plus a markup and
you're buying wholesale fleets and boats
are even more profitable this business
works because customers avoid hassle
growth comes from word of mouth and
network so what's the business mobile
fuel delivery it is exploding around the
country and I just did a 30 minute deep
dive full details here
