welcome to the ker office where we
discuss more business ideas than your
brain has the capacity to comprehend
today I had Sam Thompson on I've had Sam
on once or twice before they're highly
rated episodes it's a double episode
today and then next Monday is part two
you're going to love both of them they
might be some of the best I've ever
recorded and it's not me it's Sam he's
an idea guy I'm an idea guy and we get
really excited when we're in the same
room virtually that is we talked about
an idea fair today like an idea
conference just for business ideas we
talked about AI travel itinerary AR
having an infinite content Loop where
you can charge 20 30 50 bucks to plan
someone's travel with chat gbt as a
rapper and then publish that to have
unlimited SEO for live really just two
or three ideas today but we went deep on
both of them and then next Monday we're
going to discuss three or four more
you're going to love it enjoy subscribe
share with your
[Music]
friends I've been thinking about
conferences and the conference business
and yeah and it's like it is the last
business for me to do because I'm so
unorganized and that is such like a

[01:00]
unorganized and that is such like a
touch heavy business right but what if
what if it's like that Arrested
Development where it's like it doesn't
work for them but what if it worked for
us right so not a conference but like a
dayong conference where got it it's like
an idea con okay cool like forget booths
forget sponsors like you could graduate
to that on iteration two three or four
but year one one day booked in a hotel
or whatever I don't know how much to get
in 200 bucks 50 500 somewhere in there
and all you do there's two types of
attendees people to present and people
to listen and it's pay to playay right
you want to present your idea business
idea maybe it's a $500 ticket you want
to just listen maybe it's a $100 ticket
I don't know and it's not like Shark
Tank we're not raising money there's no
raising money these are literally just
ideas in the idea phase so it's not a
business some of them might some of the
presenters might already be starting
something but there's just like one
stage and one crowd of people and you've

[02:02]
stage and one crowd of people and you've
got two or three minutes and maybe two
or three for questions and it's like
this is my idea I want to do X Y and Z
here's why I think will work y y here's
what I think my blind spots are boom
what do you think so like everyone's
just flooded with ideas and feedback and
then there's a winner and the winner the
best idea maybe first second third place
gets a a share of the pot like the prize
money the entry fee what do we think
yeah that's a Vibe it it almost mimics
like a hackathon right like they would
do those like in college where it's like
all right everyone can come for a day
and it's like 50 bucks to get in
everyone and that's more like that's
like coders right developers are in
there they're all building a V1 of
something and then they present them and
whoever has the best one or the coolest
thing wins and so I think that part's
cool where it's like I like the ones
that involve a degree of action because
everyone can get up there and talk about
an idea that's fun I thought about it a
lot of like can you apply the hackathon
methodology or like

[03:00]
methodology or like
experience to a non hacking like it blue
callar yeah you know could you do a LSA
hackathon where everyone is in there
trying to optimize the same marketing
component of their home service business
and then people can crowdsource the
ideas and the strategies and all of that
in there the idea one is dope I think
it's totally doable and I think as long
as you layer
in what's that thing that they use in
classrooms dude it's like everyone logs
in on their computer and they can their
stuff on the screen like the Socratic
method or like something like you have
like an app and you can like you can
answer your questions as the student and
like the things get put out on the big
screen that's what the dynamic would be
is like I'm up there talking cool and
behind me on the screen is all of the
attendees votes if they like it if they
dislike it their feedback like all of it
I think you'd have to go a little bit
longer than 3 minutes cuz 3 minutes is
an elevator pitch you can't get deep
enough into like it would be like 3

[04:01]
enough into like it would be like 3
minutes plus 10 of Q&A or you could go
the opposite direction you could say you
have 20 seconds and 10 minutes of Q&A
because if you can't describe it in 20
seconds then you don't understand your
idea very well right yeah yeah like what
do you sell into to home like right we
help Home Services businesses get more
leads through PPC yeah that was what 8
seconds like right get to that
granularity I like the feedback idea
like if people could put questions up
and then others could like upvote them
like a Reddit in real time where it's
like all right he's done he turns around
and he goes to the most upvoted and
that's like what people really want to
know yeah no doubt
dud let me level it up let me level it
up you just level it up I'm gonna take
in one more okay maybe it's two days
maybe it's two two parts of one day
because I mean you can't sit for eight
hours and listen to ideas I could the I
mean yeah I was like that sounds like a
dream day right so help me walk through
this so I I think like the second value

[05:01]
this so I I think like the second value
prop could be find a co-founder find an
investor like not formally not from the
stage but just in just rowing down so
right maybe this is it the first half of
the day we're just four hours we're just
grinding out ideas it's dopamine and
it's feedback and it's Q&A break for
lunch included in the pricee of the
ticket second half of the day is just
bro down with each other and you know
everyone has like a name card or
whatever and it's like oh you were the
guy with that the plumbing CRM a dude I
have that idea like you want to do it
together I could put in 20 grand you
could put imagine the connections that
could be made right it's almost like you
take that right and then the back half
of the day is like the school science
fair where each of the people has a
table at the end that everyone can come
and sit at and so like that's it
logistically how else are you gonna find
the guy right you know what I'm saying
so it's like cool you you pay 500 bucks
let's for Logistics reasons cuz neither
of us could pull off like a multi-day
event just like we' get bored it by the

[06:01]
event just like we' get bored it by the
second day anyways we'd be like all
right we're on to the next let's say you
slot 15 minutes per
presentation so if you have four hours
you're talking about 16 presentations
total cool if you break for lunch you
bring in some barbecue you get a little
Chick-fil-A everyone's happy chilling
full and then the back half of it is
everyone has a table that presented so
there's 16 tables with all of these
Founders that are there that then
everyone else can come and have
one-on-one conversations to get even a
little deeper if they're more interested
in that idea either as a client an
investor a partner an employee like
whatever that looks like and then
everyone enjoys a nice meal to end the
night and then it's a one- day event
it's done 20 16 20 ideas got presented a
bunch of connections happened and then
we all get to go home and we have to
think about it again I wonder if you
could somehow tie the prize money to
like them launching the idea like to
hold their feet cuz how many people have
dude a delayed prize pool you don't get

[07:02]
dude a delayed prize pool you don't get
it the same weekend it's who has the
most progress after 90
days so it doesn't matter how everyone
votes what if someone has an idea and
they never do anything and they won the
money which is what I did in college I
went in presented at a startup
competition I won and then never did
anything with the idea I just decided I
wanted to
participate yeah yeah it's interesting
it's like yeah what's the incentive is
it are you the best presenter with the
most Sound Idea or are you an Executor
that actually goes and takes action on
it yeah and I feel like the presenters
like there might even need to be two
classes of them you know ideas are live
in different phases right some people
just have a passive idea and they're
like they really love hearing ideas and
they're like H while I'm there I might
as well present mine I've been obsessed
with it for a while but I don't plan on
doing anything and then some people are
like I want to do this I want to quit my
job to do this I really want valuable
feedback I want a booth right I want
some structure around getting feedback
on this and other people are just like

[08:01]
on this and other people are just like
maybe my idea is awesome I just want to
present it and see what happens you know
what I'm saying there might need to be
two tiers you go two stages two separate
conference rooms are you more interested
in like early stage ideation or more
interested in feedback of existing
businesses or ideas dude I think we
should call it the idea Fair like a
science fair it's the idea fair I like
that I got to go to name chap right now
I got to do it I D pick up the dumain
before you publish this episode
absolutely let's see I'm going to try
idea.com
first dude imagine there's no way that's
available but no idea Fair IDE Fair yeah
do you want to present for 500 or do you
want to attend for a hundred bucks and
then you just find all it is really is
just finding the venue I think like and
Catering dude it would be so fun for us
to put on an event it would be like the
most Bare Bones like only the ESS

[09:01]
it's like ADHD no attention to detail
event yeah like we forgot chairs we for
got chairs yeah everyone's got a Post-It
note on their check their chest because
we don't have name tags you know it's
like I paid $500 for a posted note name
tag posted note different colors
obviously like I'm gonna have a green
post it you'd have a yellow you know
we're organized here yeah come on
they're not even Post-its they're just
the aftermarket kind that aren't very
sticky and they're falling off just
covered with you give three when they
walk in just in case this could be a
good idea and you could have a virtual
attendee too oh for sure a little Hy
summit.com action shout out to
boys those your boys no I just found
them I just decided that now we're boys
and so I'm gonna call them homies okay
cool hey summit's cool virtual events
dude okay does it work in tandem with in
person M okay yeah it's super dope we're
planning one for Q4

[10:00]
planning one for Q4
okay yeah I like this idea especially if
like you you could somehow tie it to the
execution of it right or you don't have
to that's I guess everyone's personal
prerogative yeah because like I'm just
wondering how you do because it's kind
of a chicken and egg I can't launch it
without the money you know so I need the
money first maybe you just do something
silly like with no accountability no
legalities or it's just like a pinky
swear and then you just give them the
money I don't know yeah you just go look
dude here you go or you just don't give
out any prize money it's not a Shark
Tank situation it's like you're what
you're as a presenter what you're trying
to derive out of the situation is like
feedback and networking and just
circulating your idea and so I'd rather
yeah it's like what are you winning it's
kind of hard to put a
quantitative like thing to determine
even like other than crowdsourcing votes
from people on like the best idea but
like I'd rather use the prize money to
like give away a new computer to a
random attendee like yeah yeah I like

[11:02]
random attendee like yeah yeah I like
stuff like that all right if you are
watching this clip right now you are
watching this on YouTube and if you are
a fan of podcast please check out my
podcast while you're at it because
sometimes I have podcasts that aren't on
YouTube and sometimes I have YouTubes
that aren't on podcast so check out the
ker office on any podcast platform or
you can go to TKO pod.com also my
newsletter will throw that in there
there are no ads It's weekly it's
different content than my podcast and
YouTube newsletter. chrisj cerner.com
You'll see the link and we'll see you
there yeah and I like the idea of the
whole culture of the conference being
share your ideas right like don't hoard
your ideas nobody cares like you about
your idea right I'm just breaking that
stigma that it's like the anti it's like
the anti- NDA movement
dude anti it's like I tweeted to the
other if if someone makes me sign an NBA
before hearing their idea I don't want
to hear their idea that bad yeah it's
like yeah know this guy emailed me and
he's like hey we have this nice RV park
for sale you might be interested I'm
like
yep send it to me I'll look at anything

[12:01]
yep send it to me I'll look at anything
and he sends me an NDA and I'm just like
nope literally I just don't want to like
I don't want to take the time to sign it
like no it's just like dude you like I'm
not gonna steal your bro yeah what
am I gonna do I already have my stuff
it's all good yeah yeah not down you got
any ideas for me what are you working on
I was watching this podcast levels iio
was on Lex fredman really said yeah dude
really levels yeah super dope dude I
didn't know that I know I was kind of
shocked by it it was a fun watch it's
long like three and a half four hours I
watched a good portion of it yesterday
Peter levels is up there in terms of
like from an indie hacker like he's the
guy yeah you know what I mean like
literally it and he was having all these
conversations just around like how he
thinks about launching ideas and all of
it and you know me well enough like I
think about stuff very similar put
something in the market generate Revenue
if it doesn't work like move on to the
next thing and one thing that I was

[13:00]
next thing and one thing that I was
super interested in his take on because
he runs a lot of stuff in
AI is these like very hyper Niche AI use
cases that like feel like they couldn't
really be Standalone products but he has
that one that's like interior AI which
is like using AI as an interior designer
and you like put in a photo of your I
mean you just did the the whole redo of
your like Library room right and so
you'd like put in the image of that
before the Rena and be like this is what
I'm looking for yada yada and he's
talking about all these tools that he
uses replicate which like literally
allows for you to like just pump data
into an API and I start doing some
digging around dude and you can connect
it to
zapier okay so like the use what kind of
data literally anything images prompts
give me an example what color should I
paint my car
right and so you you the user could

[14:01]
right and so you you the user could
upload a photo of their exact car and
you could prompt in to create seven
variations of it of different colors so
that they can see this like Vis which
like is not a
monetizable not as easily monetizable
idea right like kind of fun little like
gimmicky product I think that there's
starting to be use cases there like
micro SAS little things his whole career
has been built on that right Nomad list
and you know all these kind of like
micro use cases for super Niche markets
but like they pump off 20 30k a month
and you know I'm GNA assume 75 to 80%
margins like I don't know what his
hosting costs are I've just been
thinking about what are little
applications of that AI stuff like I
have D okay so here's one here's one
very specific you just went on that trip
to Greece like yep what a couple months
ago and I'm planning a trip to New York
City and Bost Austin for the fall and so

[15:00]
City and Bost Austin for the fall and so
you know me I was like I don't really
want to plan this whole thing I pop on
Chad GPT and I say hey I'm doing a trip
for two in October in Boston for four
days and New York City for four days
here's my budget here's the stuff that I
like to do can you hit me with an
itinerary like I want to stay at hotels
like what hotels should I stay at what
restaurants and this thing pumps out a
full vacation plan like day byday
breakdown of where you're eating for
breakfast lunch and dinner what your
afternoon activity is where you should
get a drink that night and all just
through like the very classic chat like
whatever and I was like yo like there's
how big is the travel you and I talked
about it with the cruise lines like
they're massive right and all they're
doing is just being the conduit between
a traveler and the travel provider
they're doing Boomer stuff yeah you know
what I mean and I was like okay like
what's that version you pop in you pay
me $199 to plan your family vacation to

[16:03]
me $199 to plan your family vacation to
Greece and then you have the AI take all
the variables that you submit on a type
form how many people what do they like
are there allergies like whatever you
know pump it into the AI pump all of
that through chat GPT into a Google doc
or into Google Slides template M with
affiliate codes for all of the hotels
all of the like oh you know what I'm
saying I mean you could make this free
you could make it free and then you take
all of the content that you're getting
paid to make and you pump it out as
programmatic SEO like best family of
four itinerary Greece where should my
you know what I'm saying you purpose the
content that you're spitting out to the
customer as an article for SEO my gosh
people search best hotels for families
in Greece which like we just did one
right and it just creates a NeverEnding
Loop of content instead of a a viral

[17:02]
Loop of content instead of a a viral
loop it's an infinite content Loop an
infinite content Loop and I think you
run it oh my goodness people on IG that
are like Independents right like I like
to travel I shoot a bunch of video
content around traveling and they all
dude the number of these like travel
influencers that have a 299 all plan
your vacation for you offer in their
linky it's
absurd you know what I'm saying and so
I'm like okay can you leverage AI to do
that at scale for you know zero Zar
basically it costs 5 cents per output
for us like and then they can ask for
like revisions that gets pumped back
into the AI actually we G to spend three
days in you know it's like an AI travel
agent yeah so you go to these guys
selling $300 travel packages and you say
hey good news I want you to keep doing
that except you don't you don't have to
do any work anymore any of it none yeah

[18:01]
do any work anymore any of it none yeah
we'll all I want is 50 bucks right plus
your the affiliate codes that you're
linking right right and also you don't
have to do anything you don't have to do
any interaction you just keep linking it
we're just going to have a different
Link in your link tree yeah they're
going to click through they're going to
pay they're going to go to a type form
they're going to fill it out and
immediately well well you got to put a
delay on it so they think it's
personalized right and you could even
work into the llm the personality of the
influencer
yeah like you could take transcripts of
all their reals and say all right make a
Persona out of this Susan h36 in
Manhattan all right we know who she has
got it we know how she talks y y y and
then combine that with maybe they have
catchphrases or something right like
since you know I love my lattes I want
you to go to this place like it could be
so personalized and they don't do
anything literally none you just work
through them or you don't have to only
work through them that's just one
distribution Channel you just you sell

[19:00]
distribution Channel you just you sell
it Facebook ads Google ads programmatic
whatever you want yeah and let all of
the Recycled plans just start ranking on
SEO it's just in your terms and
conditions it's like by the way I get to
keep these as well right we're not going
to have any identifying information yeah
you know what I mean it's like no this
is what it is a trip for a family of
five that loves Fitness cool if you do
work in the personality of the
influencer that means that all of your
content is going to be dynamic and and
it won't sound like AI regurgitated
nonsense it's going to sound like some
36-year-old in Manhattan actually wrote
these things and she going to care that
it's listed online oh literally zero
care then we just Whit list their
account to run the ads get your perfect
vacation for
$29.99 shipping handling not included
you go you find their most viral reels
from years ago months ago days ago and
you just boost some ad spend behind it
post it to their story with a link to
your website 300 bucks a pop I'm with

[20:00]
your website 300 bucks a pop I'm with
you you could charge a hundred bucks or
50 bucks to them plus all the affiliate
Revenue plus the content you get from it
and that's the big piece of it is like
the cogs are zero so it's like in the
comp your competition on that is either
you're doing it yourself right which
most of those people is their option
they're not going to go spend $3,000 for
the travel agency they'll set that up or
they're going to the travel agency and
it's like where's you know me with my
core belief on product is like where is
like the middle ground between that two
expensive offer and the do-it-yourself
option and like how close can we get to
do-it-yourself pricing leveraging it
that's unlimited content like yeah it's
done for you but really close to that do
it-yourself pricing model I think it's
the same with this like yeah you're not
going to have to go pay 499 bucks to
your influencer at$ 299 to get a custom
travel plan we'll get you one that's 80%
as good for $30 dude and I know the
influence they're going to be like yeah
but what if it doesn't sound like me

[21:00]
but what if it doesn't sound like me
what if it sounds like AI no problem
every time you get a sale and they
submit the type form you're going to get
an email with a link you click on the
link you're going to see what you're
telling them you make whatever edits you
want you click submit and only once you
approve it and click submit will it go
to your customer I don't think anyone's
even G to care like I don't even think
they're going to do that I think it's
just like send it and again it's not
like a $5,000 thing it's like if
someone's actually unhappy with their
$30 travel plan then you refund the $30
that's our customer service policy we'll
just give them a refund like it's cool
yeah then you get into the next piece
which is creating an AI chatbot off of
their personality like can ask questions
to because you train the llm there's
like so much in that I think the core
like macro of it is like I think there's
Industries like that or offers like that
that AI has not been applied to that
going back to what we talked about in
the last podcast do I think that's like
a billion dollar startup idea no do I
think that someone that just puts 10

[22:00]
think that someone that just puts 10
hours a day in for 6 months could like
get that to being 3040 $50,000 a month
on like at least yeah solid margin I
think someone could go make half a
million dollars a year with AI travel
guides I think it's sitting there oh my
gosh you just gave me another idea but I
don't want to bring it up yet because
I'm still excited about this let me
write it down so I don't
forget my mind is like buzzing I love
that idea and I think there's like we're
talking about travel like copy paste
idea with any number of things
planning you know let's say you want to
move tell me where to move right tell me
what type of house to buy yep tell me
how much score footage I need for this
family and our preferences tell me what
grocery store to shop at based on our
preferences dude dude that would be a
fun one put in a link to a Zillow house
and AI will tell you what it'll be like
to live
there well the school district sucks and
you said you had four kids right it's
like oh okay yeah you know what I'm
saying you just pop in the Zilla link

[23:01]
saying you just pop in the Zilla link
you're like well this one's a little bit
smaller than the other one that you had
that's getting into kind of AI real
estate agents which is like also
interesting there's just a bunch of
stuff like that they feel like small
ideas but like again you go look at
levels Peter levels bio on Twitter and
dude he doesn't have any singular thing
I mean maybe now after the publicity of
the podcast I don't think I saw a
singular thing that was doing more than
half a million dollars a year
like he just has seven of them yeah you
know what I mean and it's like it's not
like yeah you know what I'm saying where
it's like which is a sick no one's mad
at that it's not you don't have to go
chase which is his whole philosophy is
similar to mine like I'm not out here
chasing a billion dollar exit like I'm
okay I want high margin cash flow on an
asset that's like semi like obviously
not as liquid as real estate or cash or
Investments but like reasonably liquid
given people's interest in buying micras
like I like that model it's funny that

[24:02]
like I like that model it's funny that
Peter levels was just on Lex fredman
because like literally an hour ago
someone tagged me in a tweet there's
this new AI not AI but this new tool
that basically ranks everyone on Twitter
based on how they're growing at any
given time and so it's like from one to
10,000 followers 10 to 100 100 to a
million a million to 10 million this
little tool which is super cool we'll
show you the top 10 people growing
followers in that range and I got tagged
because I was number 10 this week on
from 100 to a million right and number
one in that same range was Peter levels
yeah and it's probably because of that
dang podcast I mean he's always growing
fast but especially now dude he put a
screenshot up of his last or maybe it
was all time Impressions on Twitter he
just posted it 300 million or something
like I was like gosh dang dude he knows
how to get attention I don't know what's
up with the Twitter algorithm right now
but it is firing on all cylinders and

[25:02]
but it is firing on all cylinders and
I'm loving it I tweeted oh I got it
wrong dude 87 million impressions in the
last 12 months holy cow 30 million
impressions just because of the podcast
yeah I tweeted about this Reddit post I
literally just took screenshots from
Reddit that's it I saw 10 million views
dang dude it was so good it was my best
day ever I got 17 million impressions in
one day day and that's usually what I
get every month how much do you charge
for ghost writing you want to take over
mine dude I don't know if I could ever
do that no I feel like hire a Ghost
Rider I tried yeah do you're not doing
that anymore no it was fine okay I had a
good experience it was cool I missed
creating it myself more than anything
cuz like I people hire ghost riders for
one of two reasons really one is like
they aren't good at creating Twitter
content and you need somebody that's
just actually better at you than at
writing the other which is a category I

[26:01]
writing the other which is a category I
was in was like I didn't have the time
to dedicate to it I got to stop being
soft about this and just make the time
to do it I just don't know how I could
ever Outsource any of my content it's
hard like yeah it's just the one thing
that I just don't want to and I don't
think I ever should because it's so
scalable yeah it's literally you yeah
dude all right I love that idea that was
good I feel like we could talk about
that for an hour here's an idea for you
I just had this okay I haven't even
gotten my notes yet so I've been posting
Instagram and Instagram obviously owned
by meta Instagram Facebook same company
there's a a setting in Instagram where
you can connect to your Facebook page or
Facebook profile and you can just toggle
the switch and say hey cross poost
everything to Facebook yeah yeah yeah
I've seen it okay why wouldn't I okay
right no one's on Facebook I mean
billions are on Facebook but People Like
Us AR on Facebook I don't ever log in I
have a Facebook page and it's just like
why not and so I've been crossposting

[27:00]
why not and so I've been crossposting
everything and some of these videos just
take off on Facebook even like they
might not on Instagram and they do on
Facebook usually they both do at the
same time but here's here's what I just
unlocked three hours ago and this could
apply to anyone listening because every
time I talk about creating content
people kind of tune out and it makes
sense because most people are cont
consumers yeah yeah that's fine but
what's key about this is on Facebook if
you comment on your own stuff you can
link stuff and it will it's
automatically pinned okay whereas on
Instagram if you link something in the
comments it's not a link it's not blue
right and so I had this real going viral
about the Shelf dude and um it's gotten
like 400,000 on Instagram and 1.2
million on Facebook and I went in the
comments and I was like hey here's a
link to the whole video here's a link to
my newsletter here's a link to my
podcast and they were all tiny URLs so I

[28:00]
podcast and they were all tiny URLs so I
could track the clicks and within
seconds like I refreshed tiny URL and I
had over 100 clicks in like the first 45
seconds oh what what like and so okay
cool cool okay cool story but like how
many creators on Instagram are not
thinking about Facebook all like me
right not at all right so you can swoop
in there let's say you you've got a
great business creative OS that's a plug
it's an awesome business you grow a lot
on Instagram yep like you could go to
all the Ecom the gurus Drop Shipping
guys anyone and say hey you're posting
videos I noticed and you could get
something to scrape this right just a
Google sheet checkbox is it are they
cross posting to Facebook or not you
could get something to faceb you know to
scrape all that third party tool you're
like you're not even crossposting a
Facebook but you have a Facebook or
maybe they don't I want you to crosspost
and I will pay you you to just pin My

[29:00]
and I will pay you you to just pin My
Links in all your comments what are you
going to lose nothing and it's an
affiliate link too so you're gonna make
money from it I'm texting Cody right now
dude isn't that a good idea you know
what I'm saying it's
like yeah it's super interesting it's
super interesting anyone selling
anything in the world forget social
media anyone let's say you're selling
lawn chairs like from a physical retail
store like you could benefit from this
let's say you're selling soof sofware
say selling services you're a dentist
like it doesn't matter you could find
someone local to your area it's very
similar running up a meme page or a
theme page right and then just like okay
I'm gonna own this asset so that we can
do it it's like yo we'll manage
crossposting everything for you as long
as we can be the first comment I'm not
mad at that at all you specifically with
everything that we've ever talked about
