came across the most amazing business
here's how this business works and how
you can copy it it's cash-based with 70%
net profit margins it cost about $200 to
get started and it's simple to run
there's almost no barrier to entry and
almost no regulation each location can
bring in about $2,000 a week in net
profit overhead cost $25 a day long-term
leases no any lease no handshake
agreement sometimes best locations make
5 grand in a weekend you can set up and
take down in minutes and all you need to
get started is a $60 lifetime 6ft
folding table1 $50 10 x10 pop-up tent
some PEC Baskets painted sign this is
important and a handshake with a gas
station owner at a very busy
intersection last thing you need to call
a local Farm now this sign must be hand
painted cuz you're not selling roadside
peaches you're selling Nostalgia you can
charge whatever you want a $16 basket of
peaches cost you only $4.80 my friend
