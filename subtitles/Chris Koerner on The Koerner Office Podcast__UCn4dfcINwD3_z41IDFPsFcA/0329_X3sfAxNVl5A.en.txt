look at this freaking lady right here
she built a literal refrigerated salad
bar inside her countertop this gave me a
brilliant business idea that anyone
watching this could copy for about
$11,000 let's get this out of the way
this is a brilliant idea with the new
year coming everyone's trying to get
healthier and salads are inconvenient
pulling everything out and cutting it up
every time nah people don't have these
because they don't know about these
until you come along you can buy these
kits for about 800 bucks on Amazon then
you can cut in your countertop and
retrofit it to put this inside of it
then you can start using it and document
it take pictures and videos of yourself
building it installing it and using it
post it to social media and I promise
you you will get inquiries this video
had 32 million views what's the business
you're going to install these things at
people's homes you think they want to
cut into their countertops no people
would never pay for this just you watch
someone's going to watch this video
they're going to do it they're going to
DM me and I'm going to post about it and
you're going to see that you were wrong
