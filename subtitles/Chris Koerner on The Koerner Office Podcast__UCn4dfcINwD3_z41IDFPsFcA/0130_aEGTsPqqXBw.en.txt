it's a slow
Friday to the four people here on
YouTube
I love
you thank you for
watching not much to watch right now but
I've got someone coming
in I have had two questions already but
the streaming software wasn't working I
talked to a guy that has a video
production business in Miami and he
wanted to know how to grow and then I
talked to a guy that has a lead
generation service for mortgage brokers
and he's doing like three 400 Grand per

[10:02]
and he's doing like three 400 Grand per
month generating mortgage leads and he
wanted to know how can I sell these
leads again or even more or how can I
monetize them myself um so pretty
interesting they'll be live in a couple
weeks thank you a Aon I see your message
here you the man
just waiting on will he wants to ask I'm
going to go ahead and share my screen
how about
that let's do
this all right I am sharing my screen so
the next caller wants to ask about these
little compact electric scooter
motorcycles um and he's joining right
now perfect timing

[11:01]
now perfect timing
will hey Chris how we
doing doing all right um good I guess
first thing is it okay if I stay
Anonymous or off camera no problem
absolutely I actually I'm sharing my
screen of these motorcycles right now so
tell me what you have in
mind all right so from the first text
message which was like a 11:30 a.m. 45
minute search like I mean 11:30 at night
like right before bed um the the idea
was real raw I was just like oh these
are cool right like I like them and then
uh I went
on you're breaking up
will I'm losing you
I cannot hear will there you are are you

[12:09]
there hang on are you there I can hear
you
now yeah I can hear you it's just it
keeps going in and out of my headphones
and I don't want that to be the case
when you're on the call
um anyway I was long long story short is
I was trying and I'll explain it better
on the call is I was trying to put put
it together as a packaged idea like is
there a the first question is is there a
market for this is there is it
addressable in any way that there's
going to be somebody who wants to pay
way more than they could have if they
just did this themselves like they could
go buy it for a thousand pay a maybe
1,00 with tax pay 150 for a wrap and
then do it themselves I think I need to
charge around 2,000 for this to make
sense um so I'm looking I'm thinking
like the only person that's going to be
my customer is someone who doesn't want

[13:00]
my customer is someone who doesn't want
it for their the reason of a scooter
right they can go get it themselves even
someone who wants to get a scooter and
and and customize it because they could
do it themselves my customer has to be
someone who is a sees it because it's
flashy it's new and they can stand out
and it's it's it's not out there yet and
they they don't care about the money
maybe they're a affluent student college
kid of affluent parents or something
like that like somebody who's just going
to see it and be like yeah I want that
and I want my school's name on it or
something like that um so let's back up
real quick let's back up tell tell me
exactly what you think the business is
so you want do you want to resell these
do you want to wrap them because I'm not
quite sure it it's it's basically like
putting the two um steps together of
buying it sourcing it and then getting
it wrapped customized in a special way
putting that together as one product so
basically just a website
um there's there's a one I want to mimic

[14:01]
um there's there's a one I want to mimic
already um that sells these wraps um I I
I can give it to you I don't know if we
want to put it on the show or not
because I don't know if we want to give
it away or or not I
talked I talked to him and had him do a
okay it's um the OCD plug it's a it's a
weird purplish website and they do all
kinds of like car decals and accessories
out of Houston OCD plug uh
Shopify okay so you talk to these guys
in what so scroll down just a bit and
you'll see Moto compacto skins or vinyls
and it's a whole section A whole
page all right let me share
that all right Moto compacto
vinyls yeah a little bit further up uh
from the homepage it should be you'll
see the well click the yeah right there

[15:00]
see the well click the yeah right there
this video here no no no you just pass
it go down a little bit you'll see the
the oh okay yeah yeah right there okay
so 100
bucks okay view all and so basically I I
wanted like a site with a page or I'm
thinking a site a page without that
video but scroll down and you'll see all
the options something just like that
with some pre-made ones and then the
question I have which is is what also
kind of scared me is licensing for
sports team or universities or colleges
like I don't want to do that obviously
that won't make it profitable and I
think that's why he has none of those
and maybe he had if you see one there's
a customized one um it's just blank and
basically you can send a high res
resolution image and um and he can do it
and what I'll show you here
is I'm going to text this to you I guess
just because it's
easier um
I had an idea for one because I really

[16:01]
I had an idea for one because I really
like I said this came out because I
really like it and I wanted to get one
for myself um so I had I sent him a
little um picture two pictures had him
collab it and within a day or within a
couple hours he sent me back a proof um
and so you can get these custommade
right so I'm thinking like I don't know
if I want to advertise like a you know
Chicago Bulls on one and have it on the
website and then get caught or just say
you know we can customize it and and and
do it from there and just have it on a
order like individually not advertised
yeah um I I don't know if it makes if it
if it's it doesn't seem complicated like
Source sourcing these sourcing the Moto
putting them on and and shipping it out
like it does make sense like I I know
what you're thinking you're thinking
like on the surface like what value do I
add like I'm not you know you could buy
these from Honda you can buy but like
the value you add is is the bundling in
the packaging like millions of people do
this in all types of Industries you're

[17:02]
this in all types of Industries you're
just taking X ingredient and Y
ingredient putting it together removing
the friction there's asymmetric
information like vast majority of humans
don't know either of these things exist
what I love about this idea is that it's
so visual like it could go viral on
social media um it could go viral yeah
on campus like you know I went to
Alabama I'm just picturing on game day
someone riding around in one of these
with a big Alabama symbol on the site
like that would turn so many heads that
would yeah like that's that's the
customer I I gotta find I think is
someone who will pay that extra premium
because it's a custom they don't have to
do any of the work themselves and it's
it's standing out and they want to stand
out so maybe like I don't know offering
a little bit of a partnership or rev
share send a free one to a social media
influencer that's in college and let
them write around their campus in it
take some videos use that as Facebook
ads
exactly yeah I you know try to see if
it's a viral thing and if not I don't

[18:01]
it's a viral thing and if not I don't
know maybe normal ads will work so yeah
here's what I would do if I were you I
would for sure buy one because it's just
a test you could resell it whatever um
worry about licensing later okay get
like find a c like find a big campus
you've got a couple months to plan this
out because school's out right now um
get it wrapped in like a really sexy
wrap um and then find someone that you
know or trust like a friend of a friend
that say and you just say hey like um
I'm giving this to you like I need it
back like I'm probably going to need it
back depends on how this goes but you
can like you can have free
Transportation basically um but I want
to do a couple things you want to put
some sort of a Tracker inside the thing
and and they they sell these on Amazon
um they're like 50 bucks where it's it's
not like an air tag it's more specific
you want to be able to see where they're
going all over campus and like that has
to be part of the deal like if if you
don't have class one day like would
really like you maybe you pay him per

[19:00]
really like you maybe you pay him per
mile or something to go ride this thing
all over where the people are right yeah
and then this device that you use in
this app will track the map and then say
listen every time someone asks you about
it I want you to pin your map like right
on Google Maps it's probably going to be
a different map you'll have to marry the
DAT the data together no big deal I want
you to pin it so so I can see what parts
of Campus are people asking about this
so you want to know where people are and
more specifically where people are that
are more likely to ask about it because
maybe you write it through the quad but
everyone's looking at their phone you
know and there's 10 times more people
there but they're looking at their phone
and maybe you ride it by the bar at 1:00
am and there's a tenth of the people is
on the quad but they're much more likely
to see it and comment on it right and
then you can give every person like an
affiliate code so like throw up a
Shopify site literally just sell these
on your Shopify site um and have them
each have like their own affiliate code

[20:00]
each have like their own affiliate code
to where they'll get a hundred bucks for
everyone that they sell through them and
that could be like that could be the
deal you set up with every single person
that buys one uh you sell one you like
literally do the Facebook method and
just go to one campus and say if I can't
make it work on this campus then I'm not
GNA try to make this work anymore this
has to be somewhat you know doable um
right yeah so like hit that campus hard
and and see how many you can sell see
what your margins are see what you learn
um see if your ambassadors are actually
driving the thing around and you'll be
able to prove it with your with your
device um and then see if like maybe
it's not as unique as you think maybe
it's more unique than you think um what
do you think about that I I I I like the
optimism I guess I just tend to air on
the side of it's probably not going to
work but um I don't know a lot of one
thing I'd say is a lot of things I've
learned from your content is like you
don't know un let you try and if you

[21:00]
don't know un let you try and if you
don't try like then you really can't
complain about anything um so I don't
know it's it wasn't on my radar really
until I just got interested in myself
there's other things on the radar but I
don't know it's kind of interesting and
I I thought this was a perfect platform
to ask you for it some advice you could
know if this will work by the end of the
month you know and really you're only
risking a few hundred bucks because you
could resell it you know at a slight
loss if it doesn't you know pull the
pull the wrap off and sell it um yeah I
was thinking I want to find out if if
they're removable because I could just
pay a couple hundred bucks for several
different WS use the same Moto and do
several different videos or send it to
different people and use it so it looks
different um I don't know there's
there's a lot more to dig into but now
yeah that this does make me a little bit
more encouraged yeah so these cost a
thousand bucks and is there like a how
long does it take to get
them so I did a little research on the
sourcing part and and they're they're
sold out of the parts departments out of

[22:01]
sold out of the parts departments out of
Acura and n and and Honda dealerships um
and there's tons of those and I called
half a dozen of them on average they
have at least 10 on hand um I have to
find out like if I wanted to if I if it
blew up and I needed to order a hundred
like how that would work but you know if
it's slow moving around and it's just a
couple sales every now and then which is
okay like I could Source them locally
from from dealers and just go pick them
up order the skin and ship out within a
week probably yeah I mean yeah like dude
please try this for me like I want if
you don't I kind of want to don't tempt
me uh because I think there's there's
something here yeah it's interesting and
it's it's it's novel I think and may be
even more novel um and yeah the viral
aspect kind of gives it a lot of
asymmetrical upside so I want to I want
to see what happens yeah yeah well I
love the idea man let me know how it

[23:00]
love the idea man let me know how it
goes sweet thank you so much for this I
appreciate everything you do yep no
problem see you all right all
right how's it going
man can you hear
me hello hey can you hear
me yes yes can you hear
yeah how are
you I'm doing good how are you sir good
let's hear your
idea I actually don't have an idea I
just had a like a question for you yeah
yes sir so I'm
17 and like none of my family members
are like entrepreneurs and I actually
like wanted to like do something like in
that path and that like I I I obviously
know like like the the big option like
Amazon FBA Drop Shipping day trading

[24:02]
Amazon FBA Drop Shipping day trading
whatever but like I just wanted to like
pick your mind on like what's like
something I can do that like like a
majority of people don't do like in like
my summertime okay yeah lots of ideas so
first of all um I don't come from
entrepreneurs either so I wouldn't let
that deter you that shouldn't even be
like on your radar right doesn't matter
okay the only thing that matters is not
even that you're entrepreneurial what
matters is that you have a desire to be
entrepreneurial
um if you have a desire then it will
come right then you're going to do
something about it and then you'll learn
entrepreneurial skills and then one day
you'll wake up and you will be
entrepreneurial so with regards to day
trading dropshipping Etc I would like I
would find all these things that the
gurus on Instagram are selling and like
that should be your sign to not do that
thing um you should not pay anyone a
dollar myself included um to start
something or to have an idea there are
there too many free things out there um

[25:01]
there too many free things out there um
if I were you what I would do
is I would go to Facebook Marketplace
and find something just one thing to
start to flip and I would start by doing
a lot of research so I talk I'm going to
talk about this in a couple weeks on a
podcast I just recorded but um what is
your budget like if if you were to buy
something to flip right now what is your
budget today right now like I work a
part-time job so I have about like four
5,000 saved up oh cool I can work with
that okay yeah so I would take you know
500 to a th000 bucks that you're willing
to risk and it's not a big risk because
you're going to hopefully buy it right
and you'll be able to resell it um I
would go to Facebook Marketplace and let
the algorithm just kind of show you
what's going on like let the algorithm
lead you because it's going to show you
what's popular U by default and so I
would take I would find a two or three
cities that are comparable to yours um

[26:01]
cities that are comparable to yours um
let's say your city has 20,000 people
find a few other cities in the same
state that have 20,000 is people similar
crime demographics similar income
demographics and start doing daily
research on Facebook Marketplace as to
what is selling and how fast it's
selling so let's just say refrigerators
okay
um get a good feel for how fast they're
selling by messaging people selling
refrigerators every day like as soon as
one goes live set up alerts message them
and say hey would you take this would
you if it's listed for 200 would you
take 100 and just start getting a feel
because you're going to find one or two
of these markets where people aren't
responding which probably means that
they don't need to sell it to you which
probably means that there's more demand
than Supply um you're also going to find
people that are you're going to find
markets where people are more desperate
and like yeah I'll take a 100 bucks okay
there's probably more Supply than demand
so do this research and enough with one
or two specific items until you really

[27:01]
or two specific items until you really
have a good feel for your state what
where where does the market stand on
these types of items and then bring that
I live in the same state as you Texas
Allen area oh very cool yeah so then
take that research back to your own area
and apply it um once you know what the
Baseline is then you're going to learn
what's in demand and now at this point
you're going to know a ton of stuff
you're going to know what you could buy
it for what you could sell it for uh if
it's in demand or not and then just use
that data to try to buy something as
cheaply as you can as quickly uh after
they list it as possible um so you know
bird in the hand is better than two in
the bush so you're going to message
someone that list uh let's say they they
list a fridge for $200 and you know you
could sell it quickly for 300 you're G
to say hey can I come get this today for
$100 and some people um if they value
their time are going to be like you know
what yeah because I'm just go through 20
Tire kickers and some people if they're

[28:01]
Tire kickers and some people if they're
not in a rush to sell it are going to
say no it's $200 I'm going to wait to
see how this plays out it's just a
numbers game find someone that that
values their time and just wants to get
rid of it um and then resell it maybe
you resell it for only 150 and it
doesn't sell for 300 maybe you sell it
for 350 um but either way like it's not
like this isn't the end game this isn't
the thing this is going to teach you all
of those principles that you're need
that you'll need to do the endgame right
um that's like people want to start a
business and they Overlook just buying
and selling things which that is
business right it's like yeah a hater
would say well that's not a business but
no it is I'm buying something for a
dollar and I'm selling it for two um so
I would look past all all the flashy
stuff and just try to do that um and
then see and then that will also kind of
start rewiring your brain to look at
opportunity and everything and then then
you'll have two any ideas yeah and

[29:00]
you'll have two any ideas yeah and
you're talking about like don't pay a
penny to like other people out
unfortunately I learned from experience
like I paid a guy like monthly for like
day trading and stuff and I learned the
hard way but now not to do that again
yeah that's just that's just like uh
tuition you just learned a lesson and
it's usually a lot more expensive than
that so yeah and uh like how do you
manage your time to like stay productive
while balancing like different
projects um I just take on too many
projects I just I take on too many
projects and then the ones that are the
most promising or the most important
float to the top and I I put my time and
energy and resources towards that and
the ones that are less important um they
just kind of fall away so you know some
people think you need to manage your
time by doing less things I think it's
the opposite I need you need to put more
on your plate and then magically your
plate seem ly becomes bigger uh and

[30:00]
plate seem ly becomes bigger uh and
you're able to manage more and more
which is why they say if you need
something done give the task to a busy
person because they've they've learned
through experience how to manage their
time better okay last question um how do
you like manage your your like failures
and like your
losses um I just convert them to chips
on shoulders um my failures just drive
me forward and I remember them and um I
think back to those people that you know
might have cheated me or said something
negative um and I just use that to drive
me okay and I kind of remember something
like my dad has like a trucking business
he's like a owner operator like I
actually don't know anything about it
like do you know anything about that
like how we can scale that I'm not sure
if you know
anything no I don't know a lot about
that business um okay that's a good
question yeah all right this all need to
dive appreciate you thank you for your
time no problem man good luck all right

[31:01]
time no problem man good luck all right
thank you yep
bye all right if you're watching on
YouTube thank you for joining
me um let's go back to the comments so
some kind people in here a Aon Babas
Sola 52 picker thank you the anime Prime

12: PM Central and I have Chad waiting
in the lobby and I will get back to the
YouTube comments
after
Chad Chris Chad hey how are
you good man thanks so much for taking
my call absolutely are were you on the
schedule today or did you just hop in
from
YouTube um I was on the schedule today
but hey if uh if is it does it work yeah
it works absolutely oh okay I see you I

[33:02]
it works absolutely oh okay I see you I
see you okay yeah yeah yeah uh retired
judge dad
right you got it that's me okay let's
let's hear about your dad and what what
he has done and what he wants to
do yep um real quick he has uh been a
judge for a couple decades did a great
job man of integrity well-liked by his
community um is in his Twilight years
he's retired now in his 70s early 70s is
thinking about ways that he could make
money but typically what a lot of judges
do when they retire is they'll do
something like mediation he's not in he
doesn't really want to do that and so he
was talking to me the other day we
started brainstorming I love listening
to your podcast I love I love getting
into the ideas like you do and uh I
thought man I'm gonna I'm gonna ask uh
the man himself the corner office and uh
uh see if you had any ideas for us we've
talked about all kinds of different
things I feel like you have done a good

[34:01]
things I feel like you have done a good
job of kind of building um an online
reputation that people trust that people
um trust for value and to add value to
whatever it is that they're doing and I
feel like my dad might be able to do
something like that but um online
courses or um online counseling legal
counseling anyway just trying to
brainstorm as many ideas as we can for
his uh retirement years ways that he can
leverage his experience and his his um
integrity and exper experience that sort
of stuff so would you say he's an
introvert or an
extrovert extrovert okay that makes
sense and how old is he if you don't
mind me
asking yeah I think he's 71 okay um I I
don't like the course idea or like the
online mediation idea just because like
it is such a grind to build a presence
online you know it's such a grind okay

[35:01]
online you know it's such a grind okay
and okay and I I don't know he might
like that but starting from scratch
doing that like It's just tough um you
know it's tough it took Mr Beast years
to even get on the map and he's an
Entertainer um that that's I mean that's
an outlier example
but I'm just wondering what what does he
like to do what are his Hobbies like
forget his profession what does he like
to do outside of his profession
um he loves he loves sports and and
things like that but it sounds like
you're thinking maybe don't leverage so
much uh of his work experience maybe
think and and you're saying that to
develop the online Persona to develop
that online kind of trusted personality
type through X or whatever that's just G
to take too much time yeah I mean
because he already built up all these
relationships in person and then he's
he's he's going to take his exper erence
and leverage that but he's going to

[36:01]
and leverage that but he's going to
almost start from scratch by building an
online presence now you could say well
you know he could go on Facebook and ask
his in-person friends to to support him
online but this just doesn't convert
very well you can't count on that um
yeah and so it's yeah it's like you're
you're only able to leverage your
experience but not your relationships
you're starting from scratch now of
course you could you could scale it more
when you're online um but I mean I I
don't know that should mean something
coming for me because that's what I do
and I'm like I kind of fell into it but
it's a grind like I think if you reroll
my live 10 10 times I'm not putting out
content online eight out of tenen times
um because I'm an introvert oh okay you
know okay um Let me throw out another
idea that we've been throwing around he
he wrote a number of Articles kind of in
the advice column genre for local
newspapers and things like that where it
was like ask the judge you know like you
ask a legal question and then you
responds to that um is there a way to

[37:02]
responds to that um is there a way to
like monetize something like that or to
develop some sort of a newsletter is
that is that kind of the same vein
though like it's just going to take too
much time too much effort for something
like that what about just like writing a
book like a traditional book of
everything he
learned oh yeah like like just his
experiences yeah like a an ebook
audiobook physical book um does he have
like notes from all of his cases like
did he keep a journal or any sort of
record yeah yeah yeah he loves that's
that's a really interesting idea he
loves to get my kids around the the
table and tell them some of his more
interesting exciting you know cases that
he's had over the course of his legal
career so yeah that's a that's a good
idea yeah like I I mean here's here's
what he could do he could take all of
his cases and upload them to AI to chat
gbt or or whatever and you just start

[38:00]
gbt or or whatever and you just start
this with one or like five cases and
then say hey
um based on what you're learning which
of these cases are the most salacious
right like for instance for instance I I
did this research once and I was trying
to learn what types of Articles go viral
um which you could call that being
salacious and it was very clear like the
most like viral type of news article is
sadly about a child dying oh wow okay
it's depressing right but it's like yeah
people dying that makes the news but a
child like an innocent child dying um it
gets all the clicks all the views right
and so my point is that chat GPT already
knows that and chat GPT could take that
knowledge and marry it to your dad's
cases and you can say all right here's
five cases I think they're interesting
based on what you know what is the most
interesting
um and then like you could write a whole
book about that one case or you could

[39:01]
book about that one case or you could
say give me all of my um petty theft
cases um and and aggregate them together
and find me the most interesting parts
from these cases and chat GPT will be
able to find all types of random things
that you might not find interesting but
that are interesting to people and then
you take the things that are interesting
to your dad interesting to chat gbt or
or more have more viral potential and
then like put it in like a vend diagram
and wherever that overlap is that's what
he could write his book on um and his
book could also be a YouTube channel
right like he could like right now I'm
streaming on YouTube live and there's a
whopping 11 people watching um but hey
that's 11 more than zero you know Y and
like he could he could kind of write
this book in public um and which is
contradicting what I said originally but
it's like 20% more work to potentially
show it to the world because he's doing
this work anyway might as well hit

[40:01]
this work anyway might as well hit
record yeah
right um and then then he has a legacy
as well right like right so Y no I love
it I love that idea the the creativity
and the the performer in him and the
Storyteller yeah no it's great awesome
we'll run with it yeah I want to know
how it
goes awesome Chris I appreciate it man
thank you very much for taking this no
problem man we'll see you
later all right byebye
bye all
right it's just me now just me and you
nine um I have I think just one more
person coming in Daryl Matthew didn't
show Daryl needs help with a business
idea around music curation and a podcast
he's not skipped to come on for seven
more minutes so if anyone on
YouTube wants to come on you're welcome

[41:02]
YouTube wants to come on you're welcome
let me get back to these questions first
of all um anyway thank you 52 picker
anime Prime says how do you okay I
already answered that one a Aon says I
would like to place a couple massage
chairs at a local business to test the
idea what would be the best way to draft
up a contract uh what should the terms
be specifically liability wise Hey Ron I
talked about this in my tweet and I
meant it this isn't just like tweet
material this is exactly what I would do
I would go to a a direct competitor uh I
would pose as a potential customer I
would say can I see your contract I
would get that and I would use that as
my starting point and then use chat GPT
to write it this is not legal advice
yada Yad y find a lawyer Chad GPT does
not replace a lawyer terms and
conditions yada y y legitimately o
that's exactly what I would do um
because we're just proving a concept
here right you place massage chair you
proove a concept then you learn wow this
is crushing it then you actually send

[42:01]
is crushing it then you actually send
that document to a lawyer pay him 500
bucks to pretty it up now you're in
business um most people just do way too
much before they earn a dollar H you
need to reverse that so tun yes my
camera is low quality I don't know how
to fix that something going on with the
stream I don't have good Wi-Fi energy
levels at 70 most people's low yep yep
yep
agreed um Baba Sola says how do I
get
to it's being blocked how do you get to
be scheduled so if you want to ask me a
question here is the link to the form to
ask me a question I would send you right
into the
studio but someone should be joining
here soon
um so you could submit your question
there what other questions we got

[43:00]
what made me my first big money so
depends on what you define this big
money
but the business I started as a 23y old
chain of iPhone repair
stores that made me a good living for a
college student low six figures high
five figures depending on the year U but
I was working fulltime in it but then I
sold it and then I had to go through a
lawsuit with the buyers and a lot of
heartbreak yada yada yada I ended up
getting a $300,000 give or take check in
the mail like an actual check cash so
big no you know big money for I was like
26 at the time big money for a 26- year
old not retirement money my first big
money came with my next business um um
LCD cycle where we sold iPhone parts and
we were
doing uh almost seven figures a year in
net profit we never hit seven figures in
profit we never quite hit eight figures

[44:00]
profit we never quite hit eight figures
in Revenue we were like nine in change
and then like 800 in change of profit
but that business lasted for seven years
um and it it it paid well it was a good
business and then I've had a business
since then do even better
so yeah um any other questions from
YouTube while I wait for
Daryl just a reminder Tuesday July 9th
12: PM Central Standard time I will be
live streaming um basically how to not
start a business but how to validate or
invalidate a business idea so you can de
risk before starting
um that should be a fun

[45:10]
time a business around established thing
would be nice not sure I know what
you're
saying um
yeah um if you want to join
the studio here is the
link lawn care to a million thank you
for your comment the other day by the
way on my video I remember that what do
I think about City Food
Tours uh I don't really like it um
because so i' I've been a customer of
that I've done it um I went on a bus we
went and got chocolate and tacos all
over Dallas it was fun um I just think
it's it's hard to compete there um I

[46:00]
it's it's hard to compete there um I
don't know it seems operationally heavy
it seems paid ads heavy uh you got to
constantly pour money into marketing
there's not really recurring aspect
people aren't going to do that more than
once what I do like okay I'm always
going to try to give you both sides of
the argument what I do like about the
idea is doing research kind of like what
I just uh counil I'm on to do um let's
say you're in Dallas I would go do
research in Houston see how many food
tours there are in Houston call them all
up see how many answer their phone see
how many are booked pick like a date in
the future like not next week but not
next year let's call it three weeks from
now and ask all the food tours in that
City if they have space for like 10
people right like I'm a group of 10 do
you have any space um because if you
just ask for one then you're not going
to get good data because most will
probably have space for one but you want
to know how close they are to full um On
Any Given date or time uh take note of
that data and then you'll see how much
demand there is in that area um and then

[47:02]
demand there is in that area um and then
you can keep doing more research and
that can lead your decision- making
because any business idea that I don't
like works really well in a certain
Market or setting or with a certain
marketing channel or angle or with the
right influencer you partner with um
there's a lot of variables at play but
like all else
equal gut gut check I just don't really
like that idea um I don't think it could
be very high margin either but I could
be wrong on that
uh all right uh B2B and B Toc which do
you recommend all else equal B2B um they
generally have more money they're
generally more recurring but the
trade-off is that they're harder to
close harder to sell to um but yeah side
hustle idea Luke your name looks
familiar a lot of college campuses have
an anonymous messaging app for students
to share things on that only students
have access to idea telling businesses
in the area that I want to help help
them advertise the college students go
from the angle that I'm a college
student and I know how to get them in

[48:01]
student and I know how to get them in
the door okay so is that twoo different
all right Luke I'm gonna get back to
your question but um Daryl is waiting in
the lobby so I'll get right back to
that Daryl hey Chris how's it going good
how are you man doing well doing well um
random question where did you hear about
me uh I think
it had to be another podcast guest I
ended up like checking out one of their
episodes on and and I guess searching in
Spotify algorithm for their uh podcast
that they have been on and I came across
yours and I love the way you go into a
lot of the details of businesses and
stuff and I love the way you're mind
think so I like yeah I definitely want
to reach out appreciate that anyway what
I know about you is you've got a
business idea around mu music curation
and a podcast so let's hear it yeah uh
well you know first of all thanks for
taking the time you know speak with me
today definitely looking at getting some

[49:00]
today definitely looking at getting some
feedback for a business from my business
idea you know I've got a bunch of
different things going on family
full-time job the whole nine uh you know
bunch of side hustles print on demand
affiliate marketing blah blah blah blah
blah but I wanted to focus on this music
related project um I I'm again I'm a
Spotify playlist curator uh and I had a
playlist that blew up in the algorithm
with like 30,000 followers and you know
and was getting a lot of a lot of
streams for and traffic for artists that
I put on the playlist um you know and
that kind of inspired inspired me to you
know explore more ways to monetize and
just kind of expand my influence you
know within the music industry everybody
loves music so I'm trying to you know I
was like okay this this could be cool
and it's something that I was just you
know was one of my theme pages that I
was just doing as a hobby and it
unexpectedly blew up so like the
business idea essentially revolves
around like creating a hub for like
music Discovery and engagement uh uh
around music so I wanted to connect fans
and artists and then like being the key

[50:01]
and artists and then like being the key
components being uh podcast uh two
newsletters giveaways and then artist
services so I kind of wanted to build
all of that within one business and um
I'll just walk you through the elements
um the podcast would be like influencer
interviewing influencers musicians
athletes so on so forth and even
listeners of the podcast would have
options and uh opportunities to be on
and be interviewed about music that's
impactful and important to them right so
each episode you know five songs that
are important to them and stories behind
them and then I put the podcast episode
uh at the top of my playlist since I
don't have access to the Spotify
followers which was one of the issues
and okay the playlist took off but what
does that do for me how can I monetize
right so um so then that's where you
know the giveaways and newsletter come
in so like the newsletter service
obviously regular updates for fans and
you know ways to stay in contact and
then I want to focus on positive news
and not the gossip or drama that's news

[51:00]
and not the gossip or drama that's news
usually in like music and entertainment
I I hate that part it's not entertaining
for me personally and you know and then
there's tons of artists doing like
remarkable things with their music and
then you know beyond the music and then
creative things within the music so I
kind of want to focus on that in regards
to the newsletter um because those
aren't the things they're going to see
on social media you know for for the
most part um or at least the not the
most popular things it's not salacious
enough yeah yeah and then and then uh to
drive engagement you know I have monthly
giveaways and um you know things that
music fans like headphones vinyl records
concert tickets blah blah blah and then
uh to participate fans they can they'd
have to put their email in and then they
can get extra entries um you know by
following social media Pages watching
YouTube videos and so on and so forth
yeah um how would this start like what
would be this this is a there's a lot
going on so what would be like your
entry point into this idea
I'm thinking the
uh the the podcast was my idea like my

[52:02]
uh the the podcast was my idea like my
main thing because then that'll help me
with social media content and things but
I don't think that like just starting a
podcast is not remarkable enough you
know and then you know it's it's you're
you're a podcaster so it's hard to get
listeners to the podcast and things of
that nature so there there's a it's like
a that's a whole different level so I'm
thinking like focusing on the giveaways
and the newslet in the beginning because
then that'll give me a way to focus on
Communications with the fans which will
then I can serve them the newsletter I
mean you know the podcast or the
newsletter and just different ways of
communicating and contacting with okay
so start with the newsletter go from
there how what is your plan to acquire
newsletter
subscribers uh doing the giveaways okay
so running giveaways and then uh you
know giving and then maybe run ads to
you know targeted uh music fans with hey
we're giving away this headphones we're
giving away this vyl album or concert
tickets or like a like a Live Nation
gift card or something like that so that

[53:01]
gift card or something like that so that
they can go and use that for whatever
concert they may be interested in so
something of that nature is what I'm
trying to figure out on how to build the
email list because I know that's that's
really the foundation of any business
and yeah with having all of like I've
got you know the page that's connected
to it I've got 20,000 followers on the
Instagram page I've got uh 30,000 on
this particular Spotify playlist but
I've got multiple playlists with a th000
followers here that but none of I have
none of their contact information so I'm
like okay I need to focus on the email
list because without that the business
could just fall apart at any point yeah
yeah okay so top of funnel is a giveaway
to get you email addresses to get you to
drive traffic to the podcast where you
you interview musicians and then that
kind of starts a flywheel that grows the
whole thing is that accurate okay right
right um is there someone like is there
a template that you're looking to for
inspiration here like or put more
obviously like someone that you could

[54:00]
obviously like someone that you could
copy or that you are copying with this
not that that's a bad thing I love
copying no that's and that's been part
of the issue it's like I haven't really
seen anybody doing it specifically in
this way
um but you know it's I guess it's just
years of kind of doing stuff online I'm
kind of piecing different ideas and
things together
um I mean I guess let me see who no not
really okay not really not that I can
think of no well that I mean that scares
me a little bit just because I don't
like being the Pioneer you know I'd
rather copy someone so that about the
idea scares me the fact that it it would
be a long long grind speaking from
personal experience for for this idea to
give you a full-time income that kind of
makes me nervous is have you done other
entrepreneurial things in the past uh
yeah yeah I've built multiple theme
Pages um and like I said just done print
on demand and different little things
online but think significant I've had a
full-time job and haven't really had to

[55:00]
full-time job and haven't really had to
you know the job's Taken good care of me
so I haven't really had to but uh now as
my kids are getting older I'm having a
little more free time I'm like okay I
want to do something that fulfills me
but then can also make some money and
you know it's worth my time gotcha okay
yeah um and you I mean you love music
right this is something you're
passionate about okay so with the
context of that you've got a job You'
you've done entrepreneurial stuff in the
past I assume you're not in a
hurry no I mean no I've already been
doing this for like the page has been
around for a few years uh
actually close to seven years or so I
just been kind of posting here and there
never been consistent and this is going
to be the first time where I'm like okay
let me figure out a way to really make
something out of this what is the
page uh it's just an Instagram page
fresh establishment fresh EST
establishment I'm GNA pull that up um
[Music]

[56:01]
is the is the handle actually fresh
establishment or is it something
different yes yes
okay all right curator okay 21,000
people okay awesome but you've never
really been consistent um looks like
your last reel did really well huh yeah
I've had some that have done like
million views stuff but like none of
that like it's whatever to me it's like
because none of that you know it's not
leading they don't they don't yeah
exactly and then you know especially
music well people in general are fickle
so it's like okay how do I really build
out this email list and build an actual
relationship with real people something
that's going to be you know yeah long
lasting yeah okay I I I think I missed
that but I love the fact that you
already have an Instagram page to launch
this off of I think there's another idea
in fact I know there is cuz I have have
a good friend that did this idea um have
you ever thought of using your play like

[57:00]
you ever thought of using your play like
monetizing your playlist by charging
artists to be included on
it yeah and that's the issue like
Spotify doesn't um you know Spotify
frowns on that so somebody reports you
blah blah blah technically you can get
your playlist taken down but there's
tons of fake streams and boded playlist
that get reported and never get taken
down so it's it's an imperfect system uh
but just on my own accord just you know
I don't want to charge artists what I
have done in the past is I've charged
them to be at the top of the playlist
like just because at the same time I
don't want to just take money to be on
the playlist because then that
deteriorates the quality of the music on
it nobody you know I don't want to just
make it where anybody can just pay to be
on my playlist yeah um so I've kind of
shied away from that as far as uh
monetization um I'm thinking of more so
like charging artists to be on like
participate in giveaways maybe even to
have one of the songs on the playlist I
mean not on the playlist but on the
podcast uh because Spotify is the only
platform where you can incorporate

[58:01]
platform where you can incorporate
actual music into the
podcast um yeah other platforms don't
allow you to incorporate music into it
so we could be talking about the song
Blah Blah and then cut to the song and
it's actually a part of the podcast and
it plays within it yeah okay so was
looking at doing that yeah I love this
because you've got a platform to launch
off of you have the podcast and you have
um the the Instagram page I think that
um you know uh giveaways work well they
work really well sometimes they work
less well other times I think for for
what you're doing giveaways will work
really really well especially like on
Instagram so I think that's that's smart
um I yeah I I like this idea I think the
the hard part is just you just got to
get the podcast up to a point where
you're getting enough downloads where
you can actually charge for it right
yeah that that's what takes forever and
you know because I'm living it right now
it's tough
yeah exactly exactly and like part I
also don't really know if I want to do

[59:00]
also don't really know if I want to do
sponsorships I want to try and figure
out my own products and whatnot to put
on my podcast because then I'm you know
beholding to what they want me to say
what they want me to do I I may have
brands that may want to come in and
sponsor giveaways for the fans and and
have that be a part of the podcast say
hey they're sponsoring this giveaway and
we're doing this but not just sponsor
for an ad on on my playlist I don't I
don't think I want to go that route yeah
if if I were you I would try to
interview um like kind of small to
mid-level M musicians that would agree
to sharing it with their fans sharing
your podcast with their fans yeah right
yeah definitely definitely especially
they want more exposure and most people
don't they don't know how many downloads
a podcast gets because it's so new like
that it's like oh I'm on a podcast okay
cool and it's like yeah like the only
the only thing I ask is that you share
it with

[1:00:02]
I think that could be a good growth
strategy yeah yeah yeah yeah exactly and
um I've been listening to another
podcast that's FOC focused on growing
podcasts um okay so that's definitely I
I've saved a couple of those episodes to
go back and really figure out like what
my full launch podcast and strategy is
going to be not just you know the actual
format of the show but pre and post
marketing of that each episode I like it
what's that podcast called uh grow the
show grow the show I'm gonna check that
out yeah yeah that's a good one okay
well yeah I think you're on to something
um I would just advise you to be patient
and uh just be patient but if you love
it and you don't have to monetize it
immediately then you're gonna have a
great time and it's gonna you're gonna
win it's just a matter of when and even
with the the playlist I've already made
some great contacts with the artists and
you know hey that that that may bod
really beneficial for the podcast and

[1:01:01]
really beneficial for the podcast and
guest that I can have on because I've
already you know been in the DMS with a
lot of you know artists who've got good
audiences so that could be great so we
see you gotta you gotta step up yeah I
like it perfect cool man any any other
uh monetization ideas because that's
part of the thing is like if I'm not
running um ads and whatnot because I
also thought thought about doing a um a
playlist newsletter where artists get
one free like vetted playlist with all
the contact details and everything a
week but that's the free tier then they
can pay another like yeah yeah yeah and
then I'll send them information on other
playlist curators and stuff so that they
can submit music to not just to me
because of you know because there's many
playlist curators out there so it's
almost promotion for curators as well
but they're paying for this service to
get access to these playlists that don't
have a bunch of fake listeners uh yeah
but just the I'm like oh I I've gotta
really I gotta stop doing this by myself

[1:02:00]
really I gotta stop doing this by myself
I have all these ideas but it's like I
don't see myself doing a podcast and
doing that newsletter plus doing a
newsletter for the fans as well and all
of these different pieces plus marketing
it plus keeping up the Instagram page
and then also I've got to let go of all
these other side projects that I'm doing
because there's only so much time in a
day I know yeah you know so I like that
idea and there's no rule that says you
can't you can't have a paid newsletter
and charge playlist for insertion in
your paid newsletter like you could get
paid from both sides of the marketplace
oh that's
true that's true so then they're also
putting their music in front of other
artists that they may want to
collaborate with versus not just in
front of fans so it could be kind of a a
twofold payment structure like it on
both sides so um and then also just
figuring out what the Market's going to
tolerate as far as like prices I have no
clue yeah so I mean and you know Market
uh uh musicians are notorious for not
having money or whatever struggling
artist and blah blah blah but
um well we'll see did you hear my

[1:03:01]
um well we'll see did you hear my
podcast episode a month or two ago um
with Nick my business partner I'm gonna
I'm gonna send you a link to it here in
Riverside but it's called how to how to
skip the line and build a business in a
week and we talk about using artists to
grow podcasts we literally talked about
this I just sent you the link um
basically leveraging artists that are
touring and having them mention the
podcast from stage because if you can
get like 50 to 100 people to subscribe
on the same day it'll put your podcast
in like the Top 10 rankings
immediately um so you can literally ask
an artist on stage to be like hey man
just mention my podcast on stage and
they could pull out their phones right
then and subscribe and then that'll put
you up in the rankings and then that
will give you an organic boost to even
more subscribers right right or even hey
put this link on the screen QR code or
something and I'm putting your song at
the top of my playlist also exactly yeah
that's kind of we we we trade yep I like

[1:04:01]
that's kind of we we we trade yep I like
that I like that I like that um yeah I
see the the message so I'll go ahead and
make sure I check out that
episode cool yeah man thank you very
much man no problem good luck yeah thank
you good luck to you as well thanks man
appreciate it all right see
you all right I'm back on YouTube here
let's wrap of these questions and then I
got to get something to eat I'm starving
so let's go back to
Luke so we're talk about Anonymous
messaging app on
campus tell them I have access to a
platform with thousands of students on
it and that I'd be willing to share
promotions ads on it for a small fee
maybe 10 bucks a post um yeah I
definitely think that would work um the
the hard part is getting the students to
use like a secret messaging app that
they don't already use because if you
find a campus that's already sat with an
app it's going to be really really hard
to get the students to um to stop using

[1:05:00]
to get the students to um to stop using
that app and also tell them that 200
people will see it and even if three of
those students make a purchase they'll
make their money back yep all right tun
says monetizing something with thousands
of users is the easiest thing how do you
get those thousands is the question a
top of funnel based on giveaway is just
shouting for low quality leads um
monetizing something with thousands of
users is not the easiest thing I would
definitely disagree with that
um speaking from personal experience
it's not easy you've got to find product
audience fit um what are they interested
in you can't just assume that they're
going to buy what you're going to sell
them um it you know if you sell
sponsorships like just to give you some
perspective let's say newsletter only
let's say I have a newsletter with
10,000 subscribers daily So It's a Grind
we're talking two hours a day of work
plus research time
so you could make on average3 to 5,000 a
month from that newsletter but getting
10,000 newsletter subscribers is hard so

[1:06:02]
10,000 newsletter subscribers is hard so
let's be more realistic and say you have
a a thousand if you write that thing
every single day you're going to make
500 bucks a month that's not even enough
to cover rent um so monetizing an
audience is not as easy as it looks um
from the outside if you have millions of
people that's one thing um what are some
Innovative side hustles that are not
widely known but have good potential for
success I just answered that question um
Kevin oh what's up Kevin what am I most
