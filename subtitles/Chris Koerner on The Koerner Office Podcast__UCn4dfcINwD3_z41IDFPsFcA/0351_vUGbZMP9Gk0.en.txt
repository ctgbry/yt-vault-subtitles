[00:00]
welcome to the ker office it is 8:47
p.m. on Election night and I'm here to
do business it's what I love this is
part four of my four-part series called
every business I've ever started I've
said this many times I've started 70 75
somewhere in their businesses and I want
to talk about all of them because I find
it interesting and I hope you do too so
this is business number 58 and remember
these are not in sequential order this
is as I remember them and number 58 is
co-founders which is the holding company
that I own with my best friend/ busp
partner Nick at co-founders
the original thesis for hounders was to
be a hold co/ incubator a kind of unique
model that we invented to fill our needs
that's not fully a hold Co because we
don't just buy or start companies and
then keep them forever it's not fully an
incubator like why combinator because we
aren't just incubating ideas but rather
it's a place for me to get all of these
business ideas out of my head and into
the minds of other talented
entrepreneurs so I can fund them and
fund the idea and take majority equity

[01:00]
fund the idea and take majority equity
in the company and then Coach them how
to start it how to run it but they're
starting it and they're running it and
I'm just kind of pointing the way we did
this uh about a year and a half ago with
a couple companies one that I've already
spoken about fast Tree Care and the
other one that I don't think I've spoken
about yet AI guy which was an AI focused
newsletter and before we even started
these we did a cohort with three college
students which I have talked about in
previous episodes that I trained via
zoom two to three times a week for 60
days or so and that was a lot of fun and
I still believe in the co-founders
thesis and the co-founder's model but it
is so timec consuming it's fun it's
enjoyable but it takes a lot of time and
so right now the original
planmodel of co-founders is on hold
while we do other business stuff like
vending machines and Pet Cremations and
you name it we did spend 65 Grand on the
co-founders decom domain name because
it's such an awesome domain name and I'm
going to use it for the rest in my life

[02:00]
going to use it for the rest in my life
and it's a great brand it looks cool it
sounds cool and when we do start new
companies we put them under the
co-founders LLC umbrella but the real
reason for co-founders existing is to
partner with young entrepreneurs and
we're going to revisit that at some
point in the future all right business
number 59 is copy paste site I don't
even know if this website is still
around and it is it is still around very
ugly uh copy paste site.com and this was
an idea I had where it's like okay web
design agencies are not you unque
they're not new they're well established
they've been around for 20 years they'll
be around for another 20 or 200 years
but what about a web design agency that
had the unique value proposition of just
saying hey you show me a website that's
already out there on the internet and
we're going to copy and paste it now do
we mean that literally no but we're
going to go to built with and find out
what is it built with is it Shopify is
it webflow is it WordPress then we're
going to recreate it exactly because a
lot of people want a nice sexy website

[03:00]
lot of people want a nice sexy website
but they don't know what it should look
like they're not design focused or
design oriented and frankly I'm not
either and so a lot of times when I get
a new website built that's what I do I
go find something kind of in my Niche
maybe not at all in my Niche but usually
it is and then go find a virtual
assistant to build it exactly for me for
btim copy paste so that was the idea
with this business I don't remember how
I drove leads to it but I did get some
leads never really chased after it that
hard I kind of just wanted to throw the
website up and see if there was any
interest and there was
but not enough to really get me to to
keep chasing it down but someone could
still run with this it doesn't have to
be called copy paste site it could just
be a web design agency you copy other
people's websites and you Outsource all
the work to a really talented virtual
assistant and just give them a cut of
the revenue this is a good idea you
should steal this what's interesting is
you could find the virtual assistant on
upwork and then you could use upwork to
find jobs hundreds of web design jobs
are posted from entrepreneurs and
business owners like me to upwork every
single day and so don't think it's too

[04:02]
single day and so don't think it's too
simplistic to just play middleman on
upwork between people fulfilling the
actual work and then people actually
looking for work to be done that is a
wellestablished model and it works
really well all right number 60 is
called fulfillment score and this was
more of an app SL landing page than it
was meant to be a whole business so
fulfillment score I think it was
fulfillment score.com I don't think it's
live anymore it was meant to be like a
calculator for e-commerce Brands find
out how much they should be paying their
third party Logistics provider for fees
right so let's say you sold t-shirts on
a Shopify store and you also had some
hats and you had some shoes you would go
to this website you would type in how
many products you sold the approximate
weight of them the volume the platform
that you're on and it would spit out and
no no no that wasn't what it was sorry I
had to go to the web archive type in
fulfillment score.com and look up what
it actually was cuz I completely forgot
so when I go to the website it says how

[05:01]
so when I go to the website it says how
do you know if your shipping carriers
are ripping you off or not as in USPS
UPS DHL we can help we have millions of
data points on what shipping cost should
be for your e-commerce store get 15
seconds got 15 seconds to find out see
below and then there were like six
questions orderers ship per month
average shipping cost per order average
pounds per order average days to arrive
shipping carrier used most an email
address so it's a lead magnet and it's a
pretty good one because most e-commerce
brands are getting ripped off they're
pay way too much for shipping and a
quick five-minute conversation with
their UPS rep could save them hundreds
of thousands of dollars per year and so
we thought huh we can play middleman
between our negotiated rates and another
e-commerce brand that doesn't have rates
as good as ours and we can capture a
margin there so basically we would loan
out our FedEx or UPS account numbers to
other e-commerce brands with really good
negotiated rates we would mark them up a
little bit they would get better rates
we would make a margin on every package
they ship

[06:00]
they ship
that's what fulfillment score was but
the big play here was to use this as a
lead magnet for third party Logistics
customers AKA convince Shopify stores to
Outsource their their fulfillment to us
so there's a couple different ways we
could monetize here we had this built in
an hour or two we never really did much
with it but I still think it's a good
idea all right so this next one is a
good story it's called J number 61 Josh
Prout scam website so man do I have a
story for you I'll try to keep brief
because it's not super relevant to this
episode but I have so many stories of
getting scammed and that's either
because I'm super naive and I'm easily
scamm or because I just go up to bat so
many times and start these businesses
and hire these random people hire Fast
Fire fast always launching these random
things finding myself in Peculiar
situations there's I just have a ton of
surface area for getting scammed okay
this guy named Josh Prout long story
short in the early days of mining
Syndicate he was posing as a hosting
person provider as in like a crypto

[07:01]
person provider as in like a crypto
focused Data Center and he sent us this
beautiful deck I had a call with him he
sounded awesome he spoke the language he
knew the lingo he was well-versed in the
industry and we were really hungry to
find hosting providers because we had we
were selling a ton of miners and we
didn't have anywhere to put them so this
guy had a facility in San Antonio we did
our due diligence we loaded up a U-Haul
full of miners you know
$700,000 full of Hardware we drove them
down to San Antonio we get there and no
one's there we're like What but we had
already paid a $50,000 deposit which was
industry standard at the time that was
not a red flag at all no one was at this
facility long story short this guy had
taken a pitch deck from loopnet for a
data center did a control find and
replace to make it more look like his
data
center changed some facts Chang his name
and completely scammed us out of these
$50,000 and then he was going to try to
scam us out of Hardware which he was

[08:00]
scam us out of Hardware which he was
unsuccessful at doing this was a huge
blow I still remember the day it
happened it was my son's birthday we
were living in Houston it was very very
stressful I was very angry we called the
cops we called the FBI no one would
really help us and I kind of had to get
creative and I may or may not have had
to buy tracker for his motorcycle and I
may or may not have found out where he
lived and I hung out in the parking lot
for a while and I put a tracker on his
motorcycle and I found out what he was
doing and where he was going and who was
and what his real identity was and that
he had been scamming people since he was
about 11 years old on Roomscape he was
scamming people of from with their
virtual gold in RuneScape as an
11-year-old and he was just a notorious
lifetime scammer and he was so clever
and so creative and he just would have
if he just would have directed this in a
productive Direction this guy could have
been a millionaire anyway long story
short he ended up scamming someone else
for like
$400,000 and got caught cross state line

[09:00]
$400,000 and got caught cross state line
that was enough money to get the FBI
interested I joined the case I assembled
dozens of documents of evidence on him
got $35,000 of our $50,000 back which
was awesome because I expected to get
none of it back the banks actually did
me a solid and froze his funds which I
did not expect to be on the other end of
a difficult Bank I'm usually on the
other end of it where they freeze my
funds for something so we got almost all
of our money back he ended up in jail it
was a felony it was awesome anyway I
bought the domain names Josh prout.com
because that was his name Joshua Prout
Josh prout.com and Josh Prout scam and I
had a VA put I don't even know if this
website's still around someone's
probably looking at it right now I don't
you can look at the web archive you can
see what I'm talking about and I wanted
to make sure that I owned the SEO on his
name so he could never get a job so he
could never live a productive life until
he had actually paid for his crimes so
was that ever supposed to be monetized
no but I hated this guy and he angered

[10:01]
no but I hated this guy and he angered
me and so I made a website to Showcase
this to the world and it worked and the
good guys won Josh if you want to come
after me for slander or liel or whatever
it is good luck cuz everything I said
here is true also you're probably in
jail right now so you know2 is called
Nomo Nomo snore and this is a
Contraption and if you're watching on
YouTube I'm holding it right now if you
see this this is a Contraption to help
prevent snoring while you're asleep of
course cuz you don't snore while you're
awake but this was originally intended
to be a neck brace if you see this I
don't know how it works but my friend
Grant I've talked about Grant a few
times because he's a good friend he
lives 10 minutes away and I just love
the guy and he comes up with the best
business ideas and he had a thesis that
you know you snore because your Airway
is blocked off and so if you you were to
wear a neck brace to bed then you
wouldn't snore and he struggles with
snoring so he tried it and it worked so
sample size of one we thought huh that's
interesting we could sell an anti- snore
device with Facebook ads and the margin

[11:00]
device with Facebook ads and the margin
would be stupidly high and it'd be
awesome and it's called Nomo because
like no more snore and I partnered up
with some college students to launch
this I think they put up a shop at viite
maybe they didn't I can't remember but
it never got off the ground so but I
still like this idea I mean guess what
the margin is on this it's stupid so no
more snore number 63 off marketers off
markers.com is one of my many websites
and it looks a lot like copy paste site
because it's the same card template off
marketers was originally meant to be an
agency for off-market asset sourcing so
let's say you want to buy a business or
you want to buy a single family home or
a mobile home park an r or an RV park
you would Outsource that to me as an
agency and pay me one two three four
$5,000 a month to cold call not me
personally but people that work for me
to cold call on behalf of you to find
those off-market assets because hey a
$3,000 investment could save you
$300,000 on buying something off Market
compared to on Market or it could be an

[12:00]
compared to on Market or it could be an
agency for Real Estate brokerages to
help find them listings I love this idea
I don't know why it's not more common I
actually found a few customers for this
and we launched and we did well and we
just didn't give it enough attention so
I think the second month we like weren't
doing a good enough job and we were
distracted and so we ended up just
giving the money back to our customers
and pivoting so that's still a good
website and one common threat of
everything I've done in the mobile home
and the RV parkk space is is
Acquisitions I love Acquisitions
especially off Market Acquisitions I'm
pretty good at it I love it and one day
I'll start this business up again number
64 AI Guy this is one that I just
referenced a few minutes ago it was an
AI newsletter started by not me I helped
advise and point the way but it was
started by Zach our first or second
co-founder ever inside co-founders and
he did an amazing job and he learned
everything there is to know about
Facebook ads and beehive and newsletters
and copy writing and advertising he

[13:01]
and copy writing and advertising he
learned so many skills and it grew fast
and it was fun and he got our cost per
acquisition down to like 80 cents per
email subscriber and guess what we still
have these emails so I was not planning
on doing this but if anyone wants to buy
a very dormant AI newsletter with very
high quality subscribers that have not
been emailed in over a year email me
Chris coof founders.com and name your
price it's hosted in beehive right now
I've been paying the Beehive bill for it
you know 600 $800,000 over the last year
or year and a half I do think it's
possible to reactivate these subscribers
and it was kind of like the milk Road
for AI which there's a lot of AI
newsletters out there that are trying to
be the milk Road for AI but guess what
there's room for a lot of them so if
anyone wants to buy it I don't know is
it 5,000 bucks is it 500 bucks 50 bucks
somewhere in there I don't know but
there's about 6,000 subscribers and with
a five times a week newsletter that's
good for about $2 to $3,000 a month in
ad Revenue not bad 50 cents per
subscriber give or take
so across 12 months that could be

[14:01]
so across 12 months that could be
$20,000 profit 15 20 25 somewhere in
there not a bad little business so if
you want to buy it let me know cuz it's
just sitting there and we spent quite a
few dollars to acquire those subscribers
number 65 startup gems startup gems was
an experiment it was a test it was never
meant to be a real business there's a
company out there called 11 Labs that
were basically the first to do AI voice
cloning and so as soon as 11 Labs came
out and I heard about it I thought this
this is amazing I want to start an AI
podcast with a clone of my voice but
fully AI we'll use AI to write a script
there'll be 5 to 15 minute episodes
about entrepreneurs that did cool things
that we find from the internet found a
guy named raen out in Denver to help
manage this project with me SL for me it
was hosted on buzzsprout and I posted
about it on Reddit it got like two or
300,000 views I posted about it on
Twitter it got about the same amount of
views we got 1 two 3,000 downloads our
first day which is a lot for a podcast

[15:01]
first day which is a lot for a podcast
and it was really just an experiment
like can you tell this is AI and really
you could like 80% of the time you
couldn't but then 10 20% of the time you
heard some weird intonations or just it
kind of went off script for a while but
it was really cool and it sounded like
me it was kind of freaky and so we put
out like 80s something episodes one a
day for 80 something days and then it
was just not growing it was shrinking
and I wanted to see if it could grow
organically I I started a podcast before
like five six years ago but I only put
out three episodes so I'm not including
that aside from that I never started a
podcast and I know they're hard to grow
I but I wanted to see could a podcast
grow on its own without me promoting it
because I didn't want to promote you
know an AI voice clone generated podcast
that wasn't even monetized that's just a
waste of your attention so I just wanted
to tweet about it once and then see you
know could it be shared organically and
have to grow on its own and it could not
all right if you are watching this clip
right now you are watching this on
YouTube and if you are a fan of podcast

[16:00]
YouTube and if you are a fan of podcast
please check out my podcast while you're
at it because sometimes I have podcasts
that aren't on YouTube and sometimes I
have YouTubes that aren't on podcast so
check out the Kerner office on any
podcast platform or you can go to TKO
pod.com also my newsletter will throw
that in there there are no ads It's
weekly it's different content than my
podcast and YouTube newsletter. chrisj
cerner.com You'll see the link and we'll
see you there so when I launched this
podcast the Kerner office which was
first called kerner's corner until an
awesome newsletter subscriber of mine
emailed me and said what about the kerer
office I just thought that's perfect
that's perfect I was so mad I hadn't
thought of it but whoever you are I
can't remember your name but you're
still in my inbox thank you for that
suggestion because it was not my idea it
was yours anyway when I started kerner's
corner I thought NH I already have 83
episodes of startup gems that was the
name of it I'm just going to start
season two and call it Ker's Corner my
first episode ever it was just like hey
guys this was a AI generated surprise if
you didn't know now it's not going to be
this is actually really me speaking and
then after episode 8 or nine we changed

[17:00]
then after episode 8 or nine we changed
the name to the ker office and it's been
a wonderful ride and I don't plan on
stopping anytime soon number 66 the
nobas crypto podcast that was the first
podcast I ever started back during my
McAfee days when I blew up on Twitter on
another account for nobs crypto we had
an airdrop we had a white paper we had a
community with like 60,000 people in it
and seemingly a third of them were from
Vietnam or Nigeria that was a wild
couple years my life you know when you
get voicemails every week from John
McAfee which are still saved on my phone
by the way a good six years later um I
started a podcast around it and with my
friend Grant who invented Nomo snore and
his brother Max another good friend of
mine it was the three of us just Brown
down about crypto and we flamed out
after about three episodes but when I
looked back at my download numbers there
I had no idea how good I had it I was
like oh this my first episode only got
3,000 downloads wow this sucks and now
it's like geez that's actually a lot for

[18:00]
it's like geez that's actually a lot for
a podcast so I didn't know what I had
there number 67 twice used oh man what a
dumpster fire I still own the domain
name I love this domain name twice
use.com when I was running LCD cycle
which I talked about in episode one of
this series we had thousands of broken
iPhone screens and broken iPhone back
glass just sitting in our warehouse and
it looked awesome right black glass that
was broken and shattered I thought
there's got to be some way we can
recycle this now keep in mind the name
of our company was LCD cycle so we were
recycling most of them by sending them
to China and having our vendors you know
slice off the broken glass and the
digitizer put a new digitizer new glue
new glass shipping it back but you know
how you see like dead pixels on a screen
sometimes if an iPhone screen had that
it was irrecoverable and so we had
thousands of screens that were
irrecoverable unrecyclable and they were
just sitting and so we launched a
Kickstarter project and I hope you don't
Google this cuz I'm I'm sure it's still
somewhere there on the internet Chris

[19:01]
somewhere there on the internet Chris
Kerner uh twice used Kickstarter there
is the most cringeworthy video you will
ever see the lowest quality sitting in a
shady Warehouse with Michael or Emily or
one of my employees or both of them I
can't remember and we invented and my
good friend TJ we invented these clocks
that they still look pretty cool clocks
made out of Iphone glass and coasters
made out of broken iPhone glass and a
coffee table an entire coffee table
making
made out of broken iPhone glass this
could sell like this could be a thing
I've seen things on Instagram with tens
of millions of views that didn't look as
cool as this but this Kickstarter was
just a dumpster fire I got AOL to write
about me and CNET and you know I worked
my cold emailing magic and generated a
bunch of Buzz and we couldn't even raise
like $8,000 so if you can generate all
that attention and you can't raise more
than $88,000 you don't have product
Market fit you don't have a business it
was waste of resources and time but it

[20:01]
was waste of resources and time but it
was a learning experience okay
Kickstarter is hard if you can crack the
code you know figure out the mechanism
of how it works you can rinse and repeat
over and over and over I know a couple
people that do that but not for me no
thank you number 68 fire and Embers this
was the name of an LLC that my friend
Nathan and I started to buy a barbecue
restaurant called Big Ray barbecue in
Allen Texas we still have this LLC
Nathan thank you for paying for it if
you're listening to this it was probably
$300 or $400
we never bought the business we met with
big Ray a couple times I met an awesome
broker in the process but at the end of
the day he had a landlord that was not
the nicest guy and he was not easy to
work with and we were very afraid SL
certain that if we were to sign a lease
with the landlord and buy the business
the landlord would completely shaft us
over and we'd be out it was a $650,000
business and tons of opportunity tons of
upside and really a passion project like
no one buys a restaurant because they're

[21:01]
no one buys a restaurant because they're
psychologically sound clearly I'm not
and I knew that and I know that but I
wanted to do it Nathan wanted to do it
because he's a barbecue freak like I am
but it just didn't it didn't come
together so number 69 Pro in your pocket
this was a project that I was an adviser
for I didn't found it um he was a guy
out of I don't remember his name he was
out of Phoenix and he wanted to be a
thumbtack competitor or an Angie list
competitor and my brother-in-law Justin
was the developer for it brilli
developer and they got some traction but
it just it's too hard it was way too
hard of a business I was supposed to be
like the marketing guy but the product
never even got far enough for me to have
a chance to Market it so end of story
number 70 lawyers in China what a great
story I got screwed by one of my Chinese
vendors a couple years ago out of like
$200,000 worth of Hardware um it got
held up in customs and according to our
contract it was his responsibility but
when push came to shove and it actually
got held up he's like it's not my
responsibility so we were very angry and
this put us in a bad financial spot and

[22:02]
this put us in a bad financial spot and
so I had to find a lawyer in China and
I've got a good friend Brian in China
Brian Yin who's my friend and translator
every time I go there and he had a
lawyer that he put me in touch with this
lawyer was amazing he was 450 an hour
which really isn't bad for an amazing
lawyer and I have this weird sickness
where every time I meet someone that's
just an absolute rock star I just want
to do more things with them I want to
help them start a business or start a
business with them or just do something
there and so I I went to him and said um
I don't remember his name the lawyer's
name like what happens what would you do
if I brought you more customers and he's
like I'll give you 30% of everything I
bill them forever like wow that's a lot
of money let me see what I can do here
so I bought uh I think it was Chinese
lawsuit.com and the name of the business
was lawyers in China and it was a wix's
website super ugly and it was basically
just Google ads and I pointed Google ads
at Americans that were Googling for
these terms like International lawyer
Chinese lawyer lawyer in China because

[23:01]
Chinese lawyer lawyer in China because
guess what China and America do a lot of
business together and business disputes
are pretty common and what do you do as
an American when you need a lawyer in
China so it was a lead gen
service and we sent this guy a ton of
leads and I learned about all kinds of
weird lawsuits that were happening and
all kinds of random interesting
Industries and I don't think any of them
closed because you know it's not a high
close rate for stuff like this but it
was going really well and I was scaling
it and increasing the ad spend until one
day the lawyer is like hey I'm moving to
Canada I like what yeah we can't do this
anymore because I'm moving to Canada
moving my whole family to Canada I don't
like China and I'm like do you have
anyone else I can sell these leads to
he's like no not really so that was the
end of that but it's still a good idea
it doesn't have to be China it can be
between any country two more my modern
South I was living in Alabama and I read
an article about this guy that started a
business and all he did in his business
was assemble Ikea no I take that back he
didn't assemble Ikea furniture he
delivered Ikea furniture Furniture so
Huntsville Alabama population 250,000

[24:02]
Huntsville Alabama population 250,000
people was like 3 or 4 hours from
Memphis Tennessee where the closest IKEA
was there was an Ikea in uh in Atlanta
three hours away and an Ikea in Memphis
three hours away and this guy's whole
business I forget where he was located
was just placing Ikea orders people
would Place Ikea orders on the website
and then pay him for the Ikea order plus
like a 30% markup and then he would go
to IKEA in a big U-Haul or box TR truck
and pick it all up and drive it back 3
hours and meet all the buyers in a
parking lot and they would load it up in
their pickup trucks and go home
beautiful love it it reminds me of the
of our Texas snacks our bies business
that's all he was doing he was just you
know reselling a product or service and
this is still a good business idea and
so I started this I put up an ugly
website it was called my modern South
and I got some customers but I never
like I never got far enough to actually
go pick up furniture and deliver it but
I posted about in Facebook groups or
Craigslist or something and I got a

[25:01]
Craigslist or something and I got a
bunch of interested customers but I
pivoted like I always do all right this
is the last one that I can remember
um I guess I didn't include side vending
or perfume vending or any of this modern
stuff so that would be number 73 or 74
but number 72 is animal Aftercare and
that is a steal project that we launched
a few months ago I bought the domain
name for $10 at animal-care
docomo website what programmatic SEO o
is is you use automations and tools tag
parrot webflow zapier whale Sync Air

still do paid ads it just adds fuel to
the fire so that's number 72 that
