[00:00]
if you're an employee to figure out how
to use this stuff is such an unlock that
like you can legitimately two to 3x your
salary you go to chat GPT I want to be a
marketing manager okay I just submitted
1,000 applications for you this is
pretty much about as high leverage as it
gets of being able to hire 500 people
with a $200 a month subscription plan
there was a farting app on eBay for sale
for a million dollar you're never too
late for anything you only know that you
were late once it's over
I opened up a chat GPT operator in 10
different tabs and I wanted to see how
many could run concurrently and it was
six I I had 10 prompts in 10 tabs and I
ran six and then I clicked seven and
it's like NOP too many so I ran six and
then I would close one and then run the
seventh close one run the eighth and it
was the most beautiful thing I've ever
captured on my screen in my life it was
amazing some PE some people collect cars

[01:01]
amazing some PE some people collect cars
other people nfts and fancy fancy board
a
clubs Chris is out here with chrome tabs
that's right what were they doing I got
one operator to run chat GPT for me I
had Chad GPT running Chad GPT which was
crazy we were talking on my bad guys
yesterday as far as like fear of will we
have employees and it's going to quickly
become you can build massive outputs
like you know you talk about leverage
right and like this is pretty much about
as high leverage as it gets of being
able to hire 500 people with a $200
month subscription plan or whatever that
looks like that's gonna be incredible
well dude the thing was was I had six
running at a time and four of them
didn't need any help from me it didn't
need any help and what what were they
doing you said once running chat gbt
what's the rest of them doing one of
them was looking for Arbitrage
opportunities with used cars and then

[02:00]
opportunities with used cars and then
assigning NADA and and Kelly Blue Book
values to them one of them was scraping
Chamber of Commerce websites for email
addresses and it had like a 100 tabs
open like I could see and all these tabs
it's gonna be pretty crazy too when you
can like you know how there's the LL for
anyone listening to this as technical
ignore my monkey brand as far as like
called L llm llm yeah local learning
models language learning models oh so
what is it called when you feed it a set
amount of documents Pages whatever and
then it takes all its insights from that
maybe it's not as important whatever the
term is it'll be really interesting if I
can install something on my MacBook that
says just oh yeah
watch yes watch watch what I do over the
next 20 business days and the way I
respond to things I want you to respond
to things the way that I you know take
notes Here you take notes and whenever I
want to train you if you're if you see

[03:01]
want to train you if you're if you see
me jumping from Gmail to this software
it's I'll pull out my notes app and I'll
type in the notes app why I'm doing it
as if I'm I have a Mente that's sitting
right next to me and then it just
absorbs all of that data and it's the
equivalent of having an intern that
you're coming in that's coming into your
company and you're training them and
then it's all right get to work now yeah
so that kind of partially exists there's
a program called Limitless AI have you
heard of that no what was it started as
rewind. it's Silicon Valley company they
rebranded they just shipped a pendant
which I'm a pre-order of so it's an app
plus a wearable but it also the app
stands alone you don't need to have the
wearable and the pendant is just like a
clip and it just records everything it
hears everything it recognized voices
you can tell it hey this guy doesn't
want to be recorded okay I won't record
him anonymize
this I've got mine like mine is coming
in the mail any day now and I cannot

[04:01]
in the mail any day now and I cannot
wait and it's going to record everything
now for what you were talking about the
app the Mac App and the iPhone app does
that it will record everything on your
screen and then you can say what was
that tweet I saw about so and so three
weeks ago oh it was this but it's not
quite to the point where it's like all
right you know how I do things you've
been watching for a month go tell this
to Stephanie right it's not quite there
yet so we talked a little bit yesterday
about you thinking that it's going to be
a huge unlock lock for El elderly people
with a chat gbt app rapper like God to
be an executive assistant right now I
would be terrified I mean yes so what
one hand yes on the other
hand like the executive assistant has to
position it as hey look what I just
learned look what I just learned look
what I just learned it's like all right
you're my guy or you're my girl for this
right can you run these spreadsheets
through it and see if we can save money
here sure like that's how an executive
assistant can go from making 40,000 a

[05:01]
assistant can go from making 40,000 a
year to 400,000 a year right but most
people aren't going to be inclined to do
that they're just going to be like oh
shucks well I I guess say there are
304,000 executive assistants in the
United States based on job numbers today
this can capture a whole hell of a lot
of market share from there and I think
the most interesting versions of these
are going to be the same with you see
all the staffing agencies popping up now
the the
some.com you know growth assistance what
else making Niche operators models
because eventually they're all going to
do everything right so you know if you
want to go to chat gbt and have it do
anything it will but I think
specifically building around what are
the highest The Tam what Tam maybe
either Tam or just like most Niche
Services of these would be super
effective so like the ones that I would
come out with right off the bat would
probably be executive assistance the
other one would probably be some form of
bookkeeping service or software MH

[06:02]
bookkeeping service or software MH
another one within a company
specifically probably some form I mean I
don't want to say admin or like project
manager but like it's got it's got to be
more nich I mean I would imagine the Cs
CX ones are kind of already getting
heavily overblown I'm worried about the
somewes of the world honestly like all
these offshore recruiters because you
and I both know a lot of these guys
there's every other guy on Twitter has
an offshore recruiting company and
executive assistance is like the 8020 of
it like that's who they're finding
people they're not really finding a lot
of bookkeepers or video editors or these
Niche things it's like someone helped me
with my emails right no I agree that's
tough all right so here's here's
something that this kind of revolves
around AI more more than anything it
is I'm not going to use names and I'm
not going to use a company name let's
just say for the sake of this
conversation here it's a super fast
growing company that everyone who
listens to your podcast has heard of and
it's not like a Fang company whatever

[07:00]
it's not like a Fang company whatever
but like you've heard of them so I have
a friend the friends significant other
works at this company they do sales and
the sales process is you round robin
leads as the leads come in they submit
the contact us for or whatever they do
and they fill out the dock and they get
round robin into a sales rub now that
sales rub has 15 minutes to I think it's
15 minutes 15 or 30 minutes something
like that to respond to the lead you
know hey so and so you're going to help
you whatever otherwise they lose the
lead pretty typical process for I think
a good amount of sales teams M well if
they lose the lead what happens is that
lead then goes into it's either a shared
email thread or slack Channel and it's
up for gra for everyone and so anyone
can grab it and jump on it now the way
that you claim it is I believe you
either have to click on the link and
then it automatically gets assigned to
your name and a CRM or you react to it
in slack or something that nature so my
friend signif another is doing the sales

[08:01]
friend signif another is doing the sales
job and they're like this sucks because
I'm one I'm losing my own leads because
I'll be on a demo and I'll get a new
lead in and if I don't respond to it
because I'm talking to somebody else
trying to sell them I lose it secondly
like there were other people on the team
who all they do is just sit in that
slack Channel and so if you're not
responding to that lead within the first
like 10 seconds maybe not 10 seconds
maybe like 30 seconds you lose it like
for sure you're victim of your own
success exactly and so my friends for
their significant other went to some AI
development app when he's not technical
just to like throw that out there not
technical in the slightest built a
program where basically it'll run on
your computer and it will find a slack
Channel and it'll instantly click on the
link the second that something is sent
that person significant other is now the
top sales rep at this company oh man

[09:00]
top sales rep at this company oh man
gets almost every lead and it makes you
think like you know we talk all the time
about like entrepreneurs like cracking
the code and like getting more Alpha out
of this and you know maybe they need
less employees if you're an employee to
figure out how to use this stuff to do
your job is such an unlock that like you
can legitimately two to three x your
salary if you're in a commission-based
role or probably potentially just work
at multiple jobs which I'm not a fan of
from an employee standpoint but you
could probably get a lot of Alpha from
that what do you think my brother-in-law
just took a job with uh $130 million
company in the southeast United States
very Boomer owned company very old
school like everything the the product
they sell the industry it's all very old
school but you know family-owned been
around for 50 years 130 million bucks
and very efficient because they only
have like aund and something employees
right he just joined the company on the
sales team and he starts talking about
Chad BT and they're like what what Chach

[10:01]
Chad BT and they're like what what Chach
BT he's like yeah yeah Chach BT and
they're like huh what is that like a
cryptocurrency they don't know they
don't know and so I asked him I said
what percentage of your colleagues not
like have heard about it but like use it
occasionally he says
5% five wow which that that can't be
normal that can't be average right I
don't know how B it is like and
so I tweeted about it and I said 15% %
cuz I didn't think that people would
believe me I thought they would think I
was lying and I sent the Tweet to him
and he's like dude it's five like it's
legitimately 5% nothing like like
thinking that somebody is gonna think
you're lying so you lie that way they
think they can tell him the truth I know
I know I know but he looks like a god to
them he's like a he's like an alien from
the future like tell us what's going to
happen it's the free chat GPT plan
that's it well so I mean on that note
too like my dad 60 years old doesn't

[11:00]
too like my dad 60 years old doesn't
know a whole lot about chat GPT AI all
of that stuff had an insurance thing
that recently came up had to file a
claim wanted to figure out you know what
he was eligible for for that claim so he
sends me the
125 page document that is his insurance
binder you know quick upload to CLA
quick upload to chat gbt say here's
exactly what happened find everything
that's relevant fit it out for me like
this is a anyone listening this is a
very textbook cut and dry use case of
something like this he sent me the
doctum
and within you know 15 minutes because
it took me five minutes to see the email
10 minutes to do the work spit it back
out into a Google doc export it as a PDF
send it back to him and it's like here
are the exact sections and page numbers
here is the summary at the top and you
know like it's it's the perfect chat GPT
response to everything and he calls me
he's like you did not just read that 125
page document in 15 minutes and he's
like he's like how did you find this so
quick like and I was like on top of it
there's a couple tools online because
it's not worth explaining they like AI
guy is doing everything but Blown Away

[12:02]
guy is doing everything but Blown Away
blown away so yeah I mean I think it is
early early Innings and I think that's
probably pretty common sense to anyone
listening here but what do you think
about like other like you're talking
about your brother-in-law here like in
we talk all the time about
entrepreneurial uses what what's the new
business that can be started somebody
might been might have been Greg
Eisenberg just posted today on Twitter
like all of the YC themes for 2025 of
like what you know they're looking for
and it's AI agents to $100,000 employees
okay understood if I'm an employee
listening to this right now which you
know you have a very entrepreneurial
audience but I bet it's still more
employees just by power law and the
nature of that let's go through like
different employee classes that they can
just go from a contributor to like a
10xer without more work is that you
that' be helpful yeah so just like go to
like start thinking of job titles so
video is cool but you know what's better
long form audio via podcast and my
newsletter TKO pod.com go there to

[13:02]
newsletter TKO pod.com go there to
subscribe for free to my newsletter it's
one email a week very tactical and then
go to my audio podcast three episodes a
week stuff like this you're gonna love
it all free no sleazy sales TKO
pod.com I even just thinking from like a
marketing standpoint or like like I
don't know if you're in sales like
assume they want to keep their job
you're saying like how can they Embrace
AI to keep their job and make a lot more
money exactly and then like I'm even
thinking from okay I'm then operating
the recruiting world right now right
with constant higher so I have I have
two Recruiters on our team right now
like their job today is something that I
currently don't think AI can do a very
good job with which is evaluating talent
and like it's the same way where you
know the bulk of the workf flow of what
somebody does today you go on LinkedIn
recruiter uh Pro you enter in all the
keywords you I want to hire a life cycle
marketer they gotta have Clay on the bio
they gotta have Shopify they gotta have
you know the word LTV some

[14:00]
you know the word LTV some
AI can do that but also like so can
filters on LinkedIn really so like it's
not really a huge unlock there what can
AI then do to evaluate talent better is
it do you want to jump on a demo and AI
is gauging them from a video call
because most interviews you kind know if
they're weirdo or not in the first two
minutes or or like you know what would
that process look like could you have
them upload like a loom video of them
talking through something and then you
upload the video to AI I think your
point too on the outbound messaging side
with Facebook Marketplace is super
relevant like even just there's a ton of
work that needs to get done with just
the open new tab copy and paste message
send message wait for response send
calendar link like something that bdrs
do all day long like can do they have to
I mean there's this company that just
raised 50 million to build an AI agent
for sales
processes yeah that's I mean 50 million
bucks and it's a rapper it's an agent
would you raise money for something like
that right now I don't know why you need
to First

[15:03]
to First
distribution maybe I mean I I don't know
it sounds like I think the one thing
that we are that is going to be
increasingly important is positioning so
in in a world where like anything can be
made like like the product is no longer
The Innovation because it's so easily
replicable having positioning of where
why somebody buy yours versus somebody
else's like why should somebody buy your
email software for somebody else's oh
well I'm email software for
veterinarians everyone else is geared
towards e-commerce right that's super
important and then distribution and so I
think getting somebody's attention like
there's a reason that on my iPhone 16
the whatever the the button's called the
super button on the side now quick
button quick H hot button whatever it's
called it opens up chat gdt first and
there are other ones too like there's
Claude there's graic there's a million
other ones but it opens up chat TPT

[16:01]
other ones but it opens up chat TPT
first because chat TPT was the first one
that I used and is the best I don't know
maybe it is but it's also just the one
that I think of first when I think of AI
and like yeah I think that it's hard to
underestimate that like I know prior to
the whole marketing Scandal that
happened a couple years ago if you look
at the sales volume difference between
bug Light and the second most popular uh
beer in America it was like a 10x
difference which is crazy to think about
like I think Miller was the second one
right and that's because when you think
of cheap draft beer you think bu light
and some people prefer Miller Light Of
course but like the difference between
one and two is so drastic that I think
everyone's raising this money to try to
be the number one in all of the
categories yeah I just I don't know I
don't want to raise money you know yeah
I I think you for you missed one thing
and you said like first to Market
marketing wins Community wins MH
platform loyalty design I think design

[17:02]
platform loyalty design I think design
is very important that's one thing that
Greg Eisenberg talks about is interface
design loyalty right like if we if I
build a rapper for let's say I want to
rapper that is a like a handyman app and
it's just it's just chat chat gbt for
fixing stuff around the house if someone
gets used to using that even if the
design isn't great they they're just
like it becomes part of their daily
routine and habits like they'll use it
for a decade they'll use it forever and
there's going to be a million
competitors but and they maybe they're
better but they're not going to go to
the app store looking for a replacement
if it just keeps working I still think
that feels like it's first to Market
though because and and I only say that
because like every other
competitor these days can just rip off
your exact same design you had a great
tweet yesterday or two days ago whenever
you posted it of like secret to being a
millionaire copy everything like
blatantly steal and be relentless about
it bill billionaire is true Innovation

[18:00]
it bill billionaire is true Innovation
like in my mind every single company
afterwards can still just copy the same
exact design and I might have my users
wrong here so so don't crucify me in the
comments if that's the case but I do
think that like threads Facebook's
alternative for X right like I think
it's actually doing decently well but
like it is it's it's got arguably better
but like very good design compared to X
but like X just been around for so long
that like the distribution matters and I
think you know if threads launches a
standalone app I think it would flop
hard like I don't think it would get
nearly the amount of TR does have a
standal on app sorry what I mean is if
they did not get the distribution from
Facebook and right like agreed so and so
came out and launched the same exact
designed product I don't think it would
work because it's a network effects
right like
yeah from day one yeah I just think that
from like my handy man rapper idea I

[19:00]
from like my handy man rapper idea I
feel like let's say I went and raised
hundred million to launch a handyman app
that was just a chat GPT rapper and we
just threw it all at Facebook ads I feel
like just because of the small
percentage of people that even knows
this is possible and the large amount of
people on this planet you're still only
going to get a little bit of Market
penetration even if you're first I just
think it takes so long to really get to
Main Street you know yeah I think I
think that's true too I also think with
all of this stuff like the AI part is
not even going to be the important piece
like like don't get me wrong that's what
solves everything but like understanding
that it's AI is not the value the value
is that it's just actually that much
easier of an app feels like magic yes
yes 100% yeah I agree with that have you
played around with the the voice feature
on chat GPT yeah that's cool two to
three times only though the one thing
that I used it for well actually you
know go into the voice stuff that you're
using it for because I've mostly just
done it when I'm sitting with my mom

[20:00]
done it when I'm sitting with my mom
next to me and I'm like Mom ask them
like h a song and ask them what song
this is and like to her that's the
coolest thing on the planet I used it
with my eight-year-old we were just
learning about neuralink and I'm like
who do you want to be like when you grow
up Elon Musk let's learn about Elon Musk
have you ever heard of the boring
company no tell us about the boring
company and we it was like we were
driving around we were on a date and it
was like we had a passive genius with us
in the back seat that we could just opt
out whenever we wanted all right you're
annoying get out oh you're we want to
learn from you right now you know it was
just like a no pressure friend genius
friend that we could just talk to at any
point and that was the first time I had
ever used like the conversational voice
feature and I had heard it was
mind-blowing and it was mind-blowing
like I thought it was mindblowing yeah
no it it feels like magic and it feels
so I have a very stubborn friend he's a
little bit against AI right now or just
just against like why is it so much
better than Google whatever for the
first 10 minutes I was struggling to

[21:00]
first 10 minutes I was struggling to
give them examples that couldn't just be
rebuttal with well I can Google that and
I was going through all my stuff because
like this is I'm basically using like
Google but I'm getting a lot better
responses and so I was trying to give
them a short phrase as to why it's
better and what I've come to start
telling people and I'm sure you probably
have another version especially with
operator out now that you tell people is
Google has everything but you search and
then you find chap GD has everything and
it's like asking the smartest person in
the world and they're like your personal
tutor like it's like a one to one versus
a one to many is what it feels
like yeah I mean it's like think of it
like three tiers let's say I want to get
a job as a marketing manager yeah okay
so I'm gonna go to Google and I'll say I
want to get a job as a marketing manager
and it's going to show me some blog
articles maybe from like indeed maybe
blog articles that are written with
it's going to be broad it's going to be

[22:00]
it's going to be broad it's going to be
generic here's what you got to do here
here's the salary you might expect okay
cool then you go to you go up the ladder
you go to chat GPT I want to be a
marketing manager okay here's exactly
what you got to do boop boop boop boop
boop boop boop boop but then you go up
the ladder and you go you go to chat GPT
operator or an agent or chat GPT tasks
and you're like I want to be a marketing
manager and it's like okay I just
submitted 1,000 applications for you I I
know that you live in Phoenix I know
that you like like work life balance you
want part remote part so well let's see
if we hear back like that's the
difference our a thousand person AI
agent uh or a thousand applications just
went out we just got exactly 300
responses back because everyone else's
AI agent already reviewed our
application yeah and then now we're
getting 300 Loom requests here we go
yeah oh it's It Go a step further it's
like okay you have a job you got four
offers but we didn't think you'd like
these three and we would down to one
you're going to be paid $108,000 a year

[23:00]
you're going to be paid $108,000 a year
here's your benefits package you show up
on Monday like you tell me that's not
different than Google well do you know
you know biology right the big crypto
futurist guy so I actually haven't heard
him talk about this in a couple years
but maybe one to two years ago his big
bet was that in the age of remote work
more the idea of having a job is going
to go away this is before all of this
open AI operator stuff his theory was
that it was it's going to be as simple
as ever to say I have this project it's
an immediate freelance fill like
somebody joins in bids on it whatever
and you're like great you're in like you
complete the task there's a like a
crypto contract or something like that
and then you're immediately paid out but
like the idea of having a Steady Eddy
going job in the long future from now is
going to go away so you know interesting
thing to think about here too especially
as like like AI gets up and running it's

[24:00]
as like like AI gets up and running it's
like kind of being like a sniper you're
just hired for jobs doing microtasks
right and everything's like validated on
the blockchain and you get paid
immediately and it's all trustless like
I I feel like we're just further away
from that than than we think you know it
just feels like a far reach for me
that's what I would say too and then you
start seeing all this like all the stuff
that's took come out over the last three
years and now I'm like well I don't know
anything about anything so whatever I
feel like like the amount smart people
that know about crypto and AI is finite
right very finite and over the last
couple years all the attention has gone
to Ai and everything that bology said
like largely relies upon the blockchain
and crypto right so just naturally just
AI booming I think has pushed that
timeline out further because it's just
less of a priority you know what I'm
saying whereas if AI never happens we
could be there by now already you so
you've been running all of these
operators and it's at a good time
because I I quite literally need like an

[25:00]
because I I quite literally need like an
admin related person right now to join a
team and it's very very admin style work
send out the invo follow up on the
emails stuff like that have you used
Lindy yet no never heard of Lind ly I've
got affiliate Link in my bio yeah okay
well so it's like zapier with AI like
you can use like zapier has an open AI
integration right but Lindy makes it so
much easier it's just like AI plus
zapier plus equals agents that are very
userfriendly let me give you examples
and this is specifically on the
recruiting side of stuff stuff so go
pretty tactical here and make a
placement somebody hires a candidate
that we s them cool they need to have an
invoice sent like do I email Conor Lindy
ly. and say X Y and Z whatever the code
word is that I set up and then it opens
up my HubSpot account and it pulls out
it creates a custom payment link based
on a training that I taught it and then
send it off to ex client that I tell it

[26:01]
send it off to ex client that I tell it
to it could do that good okay I don't
know if it's only going to be Lindy
because the amount of Integrations they
have is limited but Lindy plus zapier
I'm 99% sure could do that okay what
about all right I used an ATS applicant
tracking system to track candidates and
something that's kind of annoying is
that they don't have a feature right now
that gives like a third party of you so
like Inn IDE deal worlds our client can
see all of the candidates we are
screening hiring sourcing whatever in in
the actual world we have to copy and
paste the good ones to a spreadsheet and
the the clients see the spreadsheet can
it open up that app if it doesn't have
like a thirdparty API like I can create
like a seat for it basically and it'll
log in and do all of that that's
probably tough okay so it needs the API
right yeah okay interesting though still
but even but chat gpts operator has a
feature where you can train it what to
do with your mouse clicks right right
okay so so this was this was my original

[27:01]
okay so so this was this was my original
question that I was going to ask you
which was if I didn't use Lindy do I
need to have a tab open all the time to
run that like I log in at 9:00 am and I
open up oh chat gbt and I say do the
thing where you're copying and pasting
you know the qualified candidates
throughout the day and then at five
o'clock I shut my computer and it's done
I bet you could do that with the
operator right now I bet you could isn't
it so crazy how
