[00:00]
in 2004 Americans spent $34 billion on
their pets last year in 2023 they spent
$150 billion on their pets it's like $3
billion a year just for pet supplements
and it's projected to double in the next
10 years so you could just be a
supplement bro slanging supplements
using the distribution of existing
businesses on Shopify that just haven't
thought about growing their business
other ways and just say hey just put my
product on your website that's it super
easy yeah why would you not do that some
do this I promise it will
[Music]
sell 3 days ago I'm sitting around right
here in my desk and I'm thinking why
can't I buy beef jerky that
imitates the exact Taste of authentic
Texas barbecue and what I mean by that
is authentic Texas barbecue is a few
things it's an Offset Smoker none of
that pellet grill crap you got post oak
logs with a specific moisture content of
about 14% you're cooking at about 250

[01:01]
about 14% you're cooking at about 250
degrees it's got to be brisket lightly
trimmed 50 to 50 salt to Pepper ratio on
the rub that's it you wrap it at 165
degrees you pull it at 205 degrees you
let it sit for an hour you slice it okay
that's Texas brisket end of story why
can't I buy that in a jerky
version why can't I it's it doesn't
exist all right if you want to go eat
jerky that has a smoky flavor to it
they're going to use Liquid Smoke which
is fake smoke it's not real it's an
imitator it's a copycat it's like Vape
jerky e Vape smoke
basically now they've got peppered beef
jerky they've got but I'm not talking
about a beef jerky that tastes very
different I'm talking about a beef jerky
that's branded differently an Ultra
Premium you know brisket iny car beef
jerky okay okay so curious about this
just so happens I love excuses to go
smoke some Meats right oh twist my arm

[02:00]
smoke some Meats right oh twist my arm
oh no no I got to go smoke some meats
and play with fire all day oh no oh big
pieces of meat a grill and the outside
cold weather a touch my
arm so that day coincidentally my wife
was picking up the two deer that I shot
last month and she was going to Costco
okay two deer from the butcher Yeah Yeah
Yeah from the processor I call it
venison but yeah I get oh really do you
shoot venison have you ever shot venison
no you shoot deer you idiot I would
never say I shot a venison
the meat is called venison get it
together even when you call me an idiot
in a joking tone it still hurts my
feelings I want you to know that this is
critical feedback for you all right so
she goes to the butcher picks up the
meat goes Pi up the meat goes to Costco
I say give me a brisket okay so she
comes home with a bunch of meat and this
was like an hour after I had the idea
okay you throw the brisket in the
freezer because it has to be pretty
stiff when you slice it hold your jokes

[03:01]
stiff when you slice it hold your jokes
hold your
jokes so I slice it up and I 50/50 I put
half of it in like your standard jerky
marinade and the other half 50/50 salt
and pepper just like a brisket would be
put it out on the smoker put some post
oak logs in there light it get back to
work check on it every hour by the end
of the day I've got jerky so the
question is how did it taste how did it
taste how you think it was fine it was
kind of mid it was kind of mid
just tastes like beef jerky that like
you know it's like we we talk a lot of
crap about food companies that put all
this crap in our food but that kind of
makes it taste really good you know very
good is a peanut Eminem or Reese's
Pieces going to taste any different in
50 years no hopefully it might have
different ingredients but it's going to
taste the exact same because you just
can't screw that up right well no like
we know people put things into our food
to make them taste better perfect

[04:00]
to make them taste better perfect
example everyone will resonate with this
Chris do you like Coke it literally the
first thing I drank this morning okay
full sugar Coke I love Coke I freaking
love Coke is there a difference between
McDonald's Coke and Coke you buy at the
store is there a difference between men
and women like are you kidding me right
now dud what are you talking about
absolutely you know McDonald's does
something to their Coke it tastes so
much better than regular Coke so yes I
believe you that you're you're smoked
jerky was mid because you probably
didn't add all the preservatives and
other flavors that people do yeah side
note tangent did you know why McDonald's
Coke is so much better I'm guessing
because they add more syrup no I don't
think so but they have this big
expensive filtration system where they
filter the water before they add it to
the syrup and they make their straws
bigger because there's something about
the science of drinking through a wider
straw like activates more taste buds
those are like the two main things but

[05:00]
those are like the two main things but
there's actually like six to 10
different things that they do to make it
taste better it's very intentional on
their part again you know there's two
Mormons talking about alcohol but I know
that when you're drinking wine you're
supposed to aate it or something I don't
know but like it changes the taste in it
EDI is out Mohammad but I believe it I
believe I believe that filtering the
water and whatever creating more surface
area of what you're drinking makes it
taste better all right keep going anyway
there's got to be a business there right
like yeah taste mid first round one try
I'm not going to chase it I wanted a
reason to chase it but more broadly
speaking the business model of just
taking a commodity let's call it a food
product that everyone's already buying
pricing it higher and just framing it in
a in a different way right like it's you
can make jerky out of chicken right so
it could be like a buffalo wing jerky
that tastes just like a buffalo wing but
in in a bag in a car unrefrigerated or
you could do like liquid death you're
sing water in a can but you called it
liquid death and threw some cool
marketing on it

[06:00]
marketing on it
you could you could have jerky and just
call it Jerky Boys you know what I mean
or like some creative some creative name
that makes it sell I I agree with you
you're talking about the idea of taking
something boring that everybody knows
and slapping some marketing on it yes
and I am saying this is a a public call
to action someone do this like someone
make authentic Texas brisket in a bag in
a jerky form I promise it will sell like
you can make it taste better than mine
but it would sell there's a free idea
for you great idea great idea one more
food idea real quick we're just gonna
lump in the food ideas together post
Thanksgiving you got a lot of food ideas
I get it lot of food ideas so I got a
pizza oven I've had a pizza oven for
years I got a different one propane
powered called gny I cooked in it last
night it's really fun it's delicious I'm
a pizza snob you got to cook it at 900
Degrees you got to use authentic
mozzarella you got to use San Marzano
Tomatoes you can't put too much crap on
it this pizza Cooks in 60 seconds okay
anyway I thought it would be so cool we

[07:01]
anyway I thought it would be so cool we
have a farmers market here where we live
and I thought it'd be so cool to bring
the pizza oven because it's like it's
industrial grade you could cook on that
thing all day if you want it and you
could crank them out every 60 seconds if
you have someone preparing the pizzas
this is a $15 product the cost what I
paid for these Amazon and Costco
ingredients is like $180 per Pizza it's
like a 90% 80 to 90% gross margin
business roll up at a farmers market set
it up you got one person making pizzas
and accepting payments you got another
person cooking the pizzas you got one
option Margarita one size one option
keep it simple no drinks nothing because
we're having a farmers market this
weekend for Christmas and there's not
like any food vendors I was this close
to signing up to be a food vendor just
to literally take my pizza oven down the
road and start slanging pizzas but then
I learned you got to have a a food
handler's permit so not too hard what do
we think can someone do that I just want
to say first I really love have you ever
had have you ever had it so it's like

[08:00]
had have you ever had it so it's like
first you take a hot dog and you wrap it
in a pizza and then you stuff it with
some jack
cheese and you chees
BL 30 Rock reference there so I hate
food businesses I just hate them because
because they might make sense
individually but like the ability to
scale them freaking sucks however if
you're going to do it you do the
In-N-Out model which is like these are
the options nah we're not like this
isn't build your own this isn't Blaze
where you're coming in and building your
own pizza like one type of pizza take it
or leave it like then that helps you
scale I think I think pretty quickly so
I like it I I think it's a good way for
someone to like test entrepreneurship
like take their Pizza Oven sell at a
local farmers market but I do I just
think you hit a a scalability seiling so
I had somebody I had somebody on my
podcast and he makes hot sauce and he
was on you've seen the YouTube series
hot wings Yep Hot Ones hot Ones hot ones
where they're like doing interviews and
they're eating and it gets progressively
hotter so like his his hot sauce was on

[09:01]
hotter so like his his hot sauce was on
hot sauce hot Ones hot
ones this is on hot ones lucky dog hot
sauce is the name of it and this is how
he sells so everything sourc locally
like literally within a 60 mile radius
EV everything except for the glass
bottle which he's like I have to import
that from China because I can't not and
he goes to local farmers markets and
that's where he sells them but he has a
scalability problem
because it's just him he's like at
$300,000 a year it's a really good
product it's won a bunch of awards but
he's like I don't know scale it yeah
exactly so I think you could do that I
think you could like do the farmers
market to test the idea but then you
have to have the thought of like all
right am I cool with just a two to
$300,000 a year Revenue business that I
make personally maybe a 100 Grand and I
just essentially created a job for
myself or is there something I can do to
scale this let me zoom out two
Frameworks for you totally agree 100%

[10:00]
Frameworks for you totally agree 100%
100% very hard to scale number one I'm
speaking to the guy that's just a
capitalist at Heart Right the guy that
just wants to turn $1 into two like that
I don't care how wealthy I ever get I'm
always going to want to go do that the
hustle I'm just speaking to the Hustler
out there okay it's just fun number two
we're overlooking farmers markets why
aren't we talking about farmers markets
how many different selling venues can
you get immediate direct feedback face
to face from the person consuming your
product it doesn't happen you could take
that feedback and scale the feedback
scale your product globally or
Nationwide based on the feedback that
you get face to face you don't have to
only scale through farmers markets right
so let's say you're some people are
short on ideas maybe that's why they're
listening you spend a Saturday go to
four different farmers markets and you
just take note where's everyone lining
up oh wow interesting huh okay wow
everyone's lining up at the pizza place
but this other Farmers Market doesn't
have a pizza place but it's a half hour

[11:00]
have a pizza place but it's a half hour
away surely these people want pizza just
as much as these people you're not going
to find a pizza place at every farmers's
Market you could find out where the
supply and demand imbalances are just by
Farmers Market hopping and then go
learning how to make pizza and selling
it at Farmers Market all right if you
are watching this clip right now you are
watching this on YouTube and if you are
a fan of podcast please check out my
podcast while you're at it because
sometimes I have podcasts that aren't on
YouTube and sometimes I have YouTubes
that aren't on podcast so check out the
ker office on any podcast platform or
you can go to TKO .c also my newsletter
will throw that in there there are no
ads It's weekly it's different content
than my podcast and YouTube newsletter.
chrisj cerner.com You'll see the link
and we'll see you there that's an
interesting framework in and of itself
go to the farmers markets see which
products have long lines like which ones
are really popular the ones that are
made to order maybe you don't focus on
maybe you just focus on the ones that
are packaged goods and you're like hey
do you sell online I can help you set up
a Shopify store or I can help you with
your e-commerce or if you have a

[12:00]
your e-commerce or if you have a
marketing agency you can help them with
their marketing or paid ads or like that
might be a really cool place to go and
get customers or to find businesses to
support and grow on scale I like that
idea that's a really cool there should
be like an Etsy for farmers markets
where you can go like an online website
where farmers markets could list their
wees it's a Marketplace and anyone
worldwide could buy something from
someone that primarily sells through a
farmers market they could have their own
Shopify store that's fine it's not like
they're only selling through farmers
markets but just an online Farmers
Market would it be like the online
version or the the Etsy version of gold
belly it's a good way of putting it well
gold belly is more like it doesn't have
to be food right yeah because like at
our Farmers Market food is maybe half of
the stuff one guy sells handmade cutting
boards or all kinds of handmade jewelry
and trinkets and whatnot so it's you
know as everything is mass produced the
pendulum swinging towards you know local
one-on-one bespoke custom Etc it would

[13:00]
one-on-one bespoke custom Etc it would
be hard to do but if you could create
like you're saying that platform and
then you you can start in real time
identifying like oh these are the
products that are taking off in the
local markets and then go to them and
say hey we have this e-commerce store
let's have an affiliate relationship
that would be really interesting you
could start by taking the mckin farmers
market and putting it online right and
just going all in on the mckin farmers
market leaving the brand broad enough to
expand and then maybe add a second at
some sometime or a third I don't know
know the answer to this who owns the
farmers market is it the city who puts
it on sometimes in our case it is but
sometimes it's private land owner and
they charge1 to $300 for a 10x10 spot
because that could be something as you
go to private land owners and you're
like let them rent your land I'll do the
all the admin and then you collect all
of the vendors information and you tell
them I'm gonna list this this is now
this is now the mckin farmers
market and this will allow you to sell
product online as well as Market when
the next Farmers Market is going to be

[14:01]
the next Farmers Market is going to be
so you're like building in a
distribution e-commerce store as well as
a marketing tool for the farmers market
itself that would be interesting you're
setting up local marketplaces is what
you're doing yeah that's a whole other
idea that like in fure Texas when we
liveed there there was a farmers market
just off the side of the road maybe on
three acres you don't need power you
don't need gravel you don't need a
parking lot you need a grassy field and
provided it's not wet or muddy you you
could set up and if the vendors need
power they bring a generator right so
you really don't need anything you need
a grassy field and some hopefully
driveby traffic and a lot of times these
land owners are just sitting on the land
waiting for it to appreciate they're not
trying to build the Taco Bell there
they're just holding it so might as well
generate some Revenue I like that that's
a really cool idea one more thing oh
geez just about farmers markets no it's
same same thing all same thing is if you
are interested in farmers markets look
at your state and their laws about
selling food because in Texas they have
what's called a Texas cottage law which

[15:01]
what's called a Texas cottage law which
means if you sell baked goods or things
that don't need to be refrigerated you
don't need any food license you don't
need any licensing whatsoever you can
make baked goods in your kitchen and you
can sell it to the public but in Texas
the differentiator is the refrigeration
if your product has to be refrigerated
they basically treat you like a
restaurant that's why I couldn't do
pizza right so look up look to see in
your stay if there's a Texas cottage law
variation and uh that can what guy I
mean in California and they're very
stringent with their with their
regulations on what they sell even at
farmers markets so yeah you're right
definitely different for each day all
right I had a guy on my podcast last
week Nic onomics and he sells pet
supplements so I'm gonna give you an
overview of his business did you know
pets have leaky gut oh don't I'm not
doing this I'm not doing this I'm opting
out of this segment why no I'm just
kidding I'm just kidding it's just like

[16:00]
kidding I'm just kidding it's just like
it's just like of course they have leaky
gut and they suffer from depression too
don't they so we should pay to fix
that all right let me give you some
stats in
2004 Americans spent $34 billion on
their pets last year in 2023 they spent
$150 billion on their pets that's a
massive increase and it's not just
because people care more about their
pets listen to this in 2004 66 million
hous holds owned a pet today it's about
87 million a massive jump of the number
of that people that own pets and a
massive jump in the willingness of
people to spend on their pets so we know
that there's a big industry and market
for pets all right so his in particular
he started out where he wanted to to
just sell supplements and then in the
process of doing his research he found
someone who had a protocol for fixing
leaky gut and he combined the two
anyways they have leaky gut and leaky
gut just essentially means that exactly

[17:03]
gut just essentially means that exactly
what it sounds you're not holding in the
nutrients and you're making yourself
sick so he he has this protocol
essentially what they do is they do
three things they get the dog on new
food they detox the yeast in their
stomach using some oil that he has and
then they reintroduce and repopulate the
gut with healthy bacteria and it's a
three-month regimen and after the three
Monon there's a maintenance thing that
he has he has about 300 to 400 active
customers their current monthly revenue
is $115,000 a month but they've got like
50% margins so like you know they're
making decent money but he's sold over
5,000 customers so he has like a
significant amount of churn and is this
the guy that was that heard our segment
about dog electrolytes that we were
emailing with okay very cool yeah was it
was a really really cool conversation
and his current channels for acquisition
are Facebook ads a Tik Tok account that
he runs that has 2,000 subscribers and a
list of 70,000 French Bulldog owners

[18:01]
list of 70,000 French Bulldog owners
that he bought from somebody like those
are that's his that's how he currently
gets customers okay I thought was a list
of 70,000 French
Bulldogs not their owners sales bulog
just the Bulldogs man there are a lot of
phos did you know people Nam their dog
phto a
lot anyways so that's his business and
it's it's it's recurring Revenue it's
mail order he sends this stuff to them
and I'm like talking to him and I'm just
thinking dude there's so many cool
opportunities I think people could do so
number one I really I really liked what
he did with the French Bulldog owner
list so I kind of want to work my way
back from a distribution model into
ideas and so I think what I would do
first is I would go and look at how many
small pet related businesses there are
in the US and where I would go is like
you know the site we've talked about the
site built with I would go and just try
and find companies that sort of fit

[19:00]
and find companies that sort of fit
maybe a less than $5 million a year in
Revenue criteria and just see what kind
of offerings they have generally
speaking what do they do do they offer
food do they offer Insurance do they
offer supplements like what accessories
what is it and then I would look at I
wrote myself like five six categories I
would pick from one of these product
categories pet food and treats which
there's a big push into Natural Foods
right now pet insurance pet supplies pet
grooming pet accessories and than pet
technology you know
trackers in particular and they do now
have technology that like tracks their
vitals which is nuts I would pick one of
those categories I really like
supplements I think supplements is a
really cool category and then I would
start reaching out cold to some of these
businesses and say Hey I want to
piggyback off of your list you've got a
lot of customers that you've sold to and
I think they could really benefit from
XYZ product what do you think and then
you could have either an affiliate
relationship you could have a equity
relationship you could or you could buy
the list from them the other place I

[20:00]
the list from them the other place I
thought of going is to like flipa or um
Quiet Light like some of these sites
that sell e-commerce Brands and so just
off we and we talked about buying email
lists before but offering to buy pet
specific email lists and then launch a
business around the product using the
distribution that you've essentially
either piggybacked your way into or
purchased I love it why not Facebook
groups there's so many Facebook groups
for pet owners that would be a freaking
great one I like the idea of starting
with a breed like going that Niche like
X ex toy or insurance or whatever for
French bulldogs golden doodles whatever
it is and that's why he started with
French Bulldogs is because supposedly
they they have the worst leaky
gut and and so that's why he bought the
list and that those have been primarily
his customers by the way I did ask him
the difference between leaky gut and
Taco Bell and he said they're synonymous
oh interesting yeah it's really
interesting so I have leaky gut just so

[21:00]
interesting so I have leaky gut just so
you know I think both words originate
from the Latin origin of
chalupa I think I'm pretty sure huh I
think the facep groups would be the
perfect way to Market it um in fact you
could just like we talked about the
other week you could buy a Facebook
group around a niche breed and you could
like you could do this with cats you
could you could do this with dogs you
could do this with I'm trying to think
of what are some other really common
cats and dogs are the two most common
pets that people are going to have in
their homes that's that's probably where
I would start but you could even go even
more Niche if you wanted to like ferrets
North Americans swallow ferrets are the
ones that I'm going to start targeting
like the industry is just growing like
crazy like the supplement industry I
didn't know this it's like $3 billion a
year just for pet supplements and it's
projected to double in the next 10 years
so you could just be a supplement bro
slanging supplements using the
distribution of of existing businesses
on Shopify that just haven't thought

[22:00]
on Shopify that just haven't thought
about growing their business other ways
like why not I would go to built with I
would get only Shopify brands that are
selling pet products let's say we're
selling supplements we find all of the
Toy like the dog toy brands so they're
they're not selling and they're they'll
never be selling supplements and just
say hey just put my product on your
website that's it and every time it
sells we'll have an automation that
tells me I need to ship that order over
there that's it supery easy yeah why
would you not do that I don't know I
mean you know built with much better
than I do can you sort like does it tell
you business type or does it just tell
you the business name both oh okay so it
will actually tell you the category so
like this because it could be a pet food
sales company but it's called Alabama
you're like what's what's Alabama oh
that's a pet food company you know what
I mean people pick these cute names that
don't that aren't descriptive for what
they actually do you can export list by
category so you could export like you
could set the filter for Shopify pets
than export like that this was another

[23:01]
than export like that this was another
idea that I'll bring up another time but
I also was like how many dead Shopify
stores are there that you could just
contact and get their email lists now
you wouldn't know if they're dead or not
necessarily from builtwith maybe you
could maybe builtwith would say like
they haven't had a sale in six months or
something like that but those would be
really interesting to Target as well
just for their lists Well's interesting
you bring this up because Shopify has a
Marketplace for selling your store did
you know that no I didn't it's pretty
genius it's basically like uh an eBay
for Shopify stores that's hosted on and
owned by Shopify and the reason for
doing it is brilliant reduce churn
that's it because if you go out of
business you're not paying them 79 bucks
a a month anymore or in some cases
$2,000 a month they would rather you
sell that and not even take a percentage
of the sale they just want your store to
stay open so they can keep that Revenue
going and do they take a percentage if
you sell or is it just like hey we're
just helping facilitate itate the the
transaction when I checked they didn't

[24:01]
transaction when I checked they didn't
they might now but it's it's it's quite
genius because it's all verified by
Shopify you don't really have to trust
anyone Shopify will say this is their
revenue this is how long they've been in
business this is how big their email
list whereas if you sell a Shopify store
in any other Marketplace it's like what
am I getting I got to trust this guy if
you go to his website like Flippa they
they do they do like a d not a due
diligence process but they do verify and
I think that they request financials
from you but I don't know if it's like
an integration with Shopify it may be
self-reported but that's even better
right cuz it's like Shopify is telling
me cool that that works I think someone
like Flippa has an API integration with
Shopify where they will pull your data
directly and essentially do the same
thing but it's not as trusted yeah that
makes sense by the way dude I forgot
about Flippa I started I started messing
around with Flippa this week like how
you are about subreddits and like
business ideas like the smoked brisket
thing right like you're just always
going to be trying to slang smoke

[25:01]
going to be trying to slang smoke
brisket smoke BR smoke brisket is a
euphemism for businesses anyways I got
on flipa I'm like that business is for
sale holy crap they have this how many
newsletter subscribers I just forgot how
much time I can lose looking at business
listings holy crap I know like window
shopping for businesses I know it's
terrible I me that's how we found mining
Syndicate I know for better For Better
or Worse that's how we but I do not need
to spend another $100,000 on a business
this year
I do not so I just looked it up and it
was called The Exchange Marketplace and
they decommissioned it two years ago
shop if I did cut this out Muhammad no I
mean it's an opportunity for someone
right like there there's an opportunity
for someone to do what shop if I was
doing what I was about to say if this
was still existing is this is a perfect
use case for that distill that IO tool
that we talked about where you could
track changes on a website because I I
guarantee you the majority of the
listings that make it to that old
exchange Marketplace were people that

[26:01]
exchange Marketplace were people that
were going to close their store anyway
so if it doesn't sell and if it's list
been listed forever you can come in
there and be like hey dude I'll give you
a 100 bucks I know it's listed for 20
grand I'll give you 100 bucks because we
both know you're just gonna you're just
GNA shut this down so you're freaking
barking shopping before we move on to
your next idea how proud of me were you
when I brought up built with
I'm I had to I had to edit out me crying
just put it that
way Chris I was watching you you didn't
edit anything when I was thinking about
this idea and I was like writing about
it I'm like oh I could just go to built
with and find just because of the
conversations we've had and it was cool
it was just cool it was a cool Moment
full cir Flex it's a flex Flex all right
what you think please share it with a
friend and we'll see you next time on
the ker office
