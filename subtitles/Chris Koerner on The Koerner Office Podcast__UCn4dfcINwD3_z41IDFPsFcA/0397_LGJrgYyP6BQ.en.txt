look at this freaking thing right here
these are called fabric ceilings and
they're super popular in Greece and
elsewhere in Europe and I think they
need to be here in the US and here's how
you should do it I call it the piggyback
method I've already done content about
people that install pergolas it cost
like $8 to $12,000 to install a Pergola
but look how they look they're ugly who
wants that if I were you I'd go find a
dozen or two of these pergola
installation businesses and piggyback on
them say hey I install fabric ceilings
on pergas you need to offer this as an
upcharge I know how to do it you
upcharge 1,000 bucks I'll give 200 of
that for you just for referring me and
I'll do all the work let's say your
costs are 200 bucks your labor takes a
couple hours and you're making $200 to
$300 an hour to install something that
objectively looks awesome and that
people would pay for so I made a
business plan for it right here
