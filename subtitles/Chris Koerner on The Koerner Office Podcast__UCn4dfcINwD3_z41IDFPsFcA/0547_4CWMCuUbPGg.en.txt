look at this freaking thing right here
could this be the next pickle ball
before I answer that let me tell you why
pickle ball became so dang popular
there's only one reason and here's why
pickle ball is not going away like ret
ball did unfortunately pickle ball is
popular because it made an already
popular sport much more accessible to
the masses it doesn't have a steep
learning curve a grandma can play with a
10-year-old you can feel like you're
good at it within an hour of playing
kind of like viral iPhone apps they want
you to feel like you're really good at
it so you just keep playing forever
that's why pickle ball works and that's
why golf is stupid because it's not very
accessible but this port is trying to be
the pickle ball by making golf more
accessible with bigger clubs bigger
holes and pickle ball like golf balls so
will the sport work or not I don't know
and I don't care but I like the
framework take something that's popular
make it more accessible to the masses
profit then bro down get all my business
ideas right here
