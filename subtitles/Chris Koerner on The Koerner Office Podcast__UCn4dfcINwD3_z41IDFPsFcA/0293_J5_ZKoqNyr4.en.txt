so I'm out on a bike ride and I saw
something that stopped me in my literal
tracks and I had to show you guys this
sign is a master class on what not to do
when trying to Brand a company DR Horton
has this type of a reputation when it
comes to Home Building they're terrible
but they're proud they think that
they're better than they are and so they
put their name on these signs not having
any self-awareness about what type of
company they actually are they'd be
better served not putting their name on
the sign so when people drive into the
neighborhood to shop for homes and they
see homes and they actually end up
liking it and they think huh oh wow this
is Dr Horton I didn't know DR Horton
Homes were nice and they might buy it
but if they see the sign before they
enter the neighborhood then they won't
even enter the neighborhood or if they
do they're going to have confirmation
bias and every home they look at will be
through the lens of oh this is Dr Horton
or this is Dr Horton confirmation bias
is a real thing branding is a real thing
get it right follow me for more ideas
like this
