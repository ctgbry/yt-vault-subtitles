Bolt is the first vibe coding tool to
bring clawed code into the browser. So
all those endless error loops that burn
through all of your credits are gone.
The code just works. So watch this real
quick. I'm always starting a business
and I want a way to get the word out
without constantly running paid ads. So
I'm going to build a PR app that handles
the entire outreach process. It finds
the right people. It writes them
pitches, sends them emails, and tracks
responses. This is all stuff that PR
agencies charge 10 grand a month for.
and I'm automating it. This is amazing.
It connected OpenAI for all the
copyrightiting with one prompt. All the
emails became automated with one prompt.
And it created the database to track all
of the responses with, you guessed it,
one prompt. So now you can ship real
apps with this tool to real people.
These are apps that make money. So no
wasted credits, no frustration, no
coding ability, just working apps. The
gold rush is happening right now. So
stop just waiting around. Start building
something with Bolt.news News V2 model
today before someone else builds your
app idea.
