look at this freaking lady right here
this is genius she opened an on your
honor Bakery stand with mostly sourdough
items what do I mean by on your honor it
means that no one is attending it people
have to pay with a QR code on venmo and
they could steal it if they want but she
is making out like a bandit and why
because people are good and the small
percentage of people that steal from her
don't even come close to what it would
cost her to hire someone and put them in
that Booth all day it's a net win it's
genius and we are going to start seeing
more of this so you could look at the
world as if oh people are so crooked the
world's getting worse every day I would
never do this and you'll be sad and
you'll see in the world what you think
it already is or you could be an
optimist and say I'm going to do this
because I can make a profit and I think
people are good and guess what I'll do
you one more if you look right here
right outside my window you see that
little mini fridge on my front porch
we've done the same thing my wife makes
Cookie Bars and they're amazing and she
puts them in a mini fridge on her front
porch and she's never been stolen from
Full business plan right here
