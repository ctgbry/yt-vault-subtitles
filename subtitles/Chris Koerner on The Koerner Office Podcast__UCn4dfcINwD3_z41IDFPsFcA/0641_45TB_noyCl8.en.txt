look at this freaking thing right here
see if you ever have trouble coming up
with a business idea you just need to
solve a problem for yourself first most
people don't realize that if they have a
problem that they're solving for
themselves it almost certainly solves
the problem for someone else as well the
trick is being more self-aware in your
life this guy had poachers come on his
property they cut the padlock to his
gate the gate clearly wasn't helping so
he built this concrete block he put a
big hump in the middle of it so his
tractor could still get over it and he
stopped poers in their tracks now he's
selling this product all over the world
no Niche is too small
