my friend Mitchell owns an ATM Empire
and one day he got a call that knocked
him off his feet a guy was asking for an
ATM to be installed that day at his
dispensary in Los Angeles he didn't have
any ATMs on hand that's not how the
business works but wait he had one in
his garage that he'd been working on so
we drove home he fixed up the one in his
garage he delivered it to the dispensary
and guess what it did a th000
transactions the first month the next
month 1,600 transactions today this one
machine profits him $3,500 a month which
is about as much as an ATM cost Mitchell
went from 3 to 93 ATMs in 3 years and
started with next to nothing here's
everything I learned from Mitchell
