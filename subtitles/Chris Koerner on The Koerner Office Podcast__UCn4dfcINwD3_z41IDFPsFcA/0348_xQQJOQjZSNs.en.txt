[00:00]
we would just negotiate just a real
minimum basic rental rate with the
convenience store put up the peach stand
in that convenience store then go three
miles away and put up another one and
they would not cannibalize or compete
against each other you can charge
whatever you want and I was like holy
cow this is a little ATM machine that I
can replicate over and over and over and
over again I opened 100 Road tide stands
100 Peach stands the very first summer a
good roadside stand should profit at in
a
[Music]
moment welcome to the ker office so I am
very excited about this episode and I
have no idea how it'll do we're going to
talk about roadside produce stands today
because oh what an incredible business
this is cost about $200 to start you
don't need a lease almost no regulation
70% margins you can buy the fruit
directly from the wholesaler with a
phone call and Shannon opened 100
roadside Peach stands in her first
summer we got super nitty-gritty and IAL

[01:00]
summer we got super nitty-gritty and IAL
these stands are much much more
profitable than you think please share
with a friend enjoy we'll see you next
time okay so let's back up and tell me
what you do tell me about your business
okay so 11 years ago I am a reporter in
a in-depth researcher by trade so I
worked for the forar telegram for a
number of years I love the forar
telegram yeah I was writing and I got in
on the tail end of when it was still
super cool and like the old guard was
there and so you know got to hang out in
The Newsroom got to work with the
in-depth investigative team doing
research for those long-term stories my
husband at the time so had a baby and
and anyway was staying home and trying
to figure out like how to juggle 60 70
hour weeks with a newborn so I took time
off and then started doing a lot of
freelancing and then went to work for
the family software company we had a
very large software company we did
Casino gaming so that's really where I
learns the ins and out of marketing and

[02:01]
learns the ins and out of marketing and
the ins and out of consumer economics
consumer Behavior what compels people to
purchase things in 2013 uh 20 yeah 2013
my dad got very sick so my dad is the
one who founded this big software
company you know it was quite big for
our local area and anyway he got brain
cancer and he passed away and at that
time I just decided I really want to do
something that's more tangible and then
like face to face so I can actually see
look somebody in the eyes and understand
that I am doing something of value so a
friend of mine for years who had worked
with us at the software company had said
you got to come out to South Carolina
and see what it's like to sell peaches
like it's a roadside stand business it's
all cash based everybody's happy there's
no stress right it's not a hard cell
it's the softest cell in the world so I
heard this for a number of years and I
just it didn't really click with me but
when my dad got sick and passed away and
then I went through a divorce and like
all the this upheaval and transition I

[03:01]
all the this upheaval and transition I
said okay all right I'm going to come to
South Carolina so I got my son Finn
finnean at the time was 11 and I said
let's go we're going to South Carolina
so just he and I went and we apprenticed
for the entire summer and at roadside
stands and and and then they were just
straight up Peach stands and there's
multiple stands you were bouncing
between yes yes so that very first
summer I'm a little bit insane because I
like to like go hard and go big in order
to consume as many lessons as I can in a
short amount of time so that very first
summer that we were there and I was
Boots On The Ground Learning I opened
100 roadside stands 100 Peach stands the
first summer when you were supposed to
just be apprenticing yes yes I decided I
decided I had enough skill and aptitude
and experience that piece of cake I can

[04:00]
and experience that piece of cake I can
do this what I what I saw what I saw in
this unsophisticated business model was
something that was elastic and scalable
and I was like holy cow this is a little
ATM machine that I can replicate over
and over and over and over again and so
that's what I set out to understand that
summer and with him my mentor this older
gentleman named Rob he's the OG Peach
guy with his help and then at the time I
had warehouses I had a lot of warehouses
around different parts of the Southern
United States I had you know a fleet of
trucks I had Crews and so it was very
easy for me to kind of roll into that
that logistically and that kind of
launch and and I absolutely did
everything wrong that year but I learned
how to recover quickly how to Pivot and
how to make it right and so that year I
think we did that very first year was
that
2013 I can't remember honestly if it was

[05:00]
2013 I can't remember honestly if it was
2013 or 2014 I think it was 2013 we did
gross sales in excess of $2 million
selling just peaches that's it cash it
was insane
insane okay first of all why did you
have all these trucks and warehouses
like where do those the casino business
okay the casino business so at that time
I was phasing out of that business my
dad was in hospice and passing away and
I was ready to transition into something
else and I knew once he passed away and
you know my husband and I were
separating so this was a bit a large
family business and so I knew I needed
to do something else I
was right I was not going to do software
sales a casino gaming without my dad
there so that's why I pivoted into this
other business not knowing really
truthfully I thought it would just be
short term that's what I thought but
after that first year I realized that
this is is this is something that that

[06:02]
this is is this is something that that
can create a legacy and so my son was 11
at the time and now we're business
partners today he just turned 22 this is
all he's ever done okay
so what month did you go out there and
you were just going to go out there and
learn kind of get a you knew business
clearly but you're GNA learn from this
Mentor what month was that so I peach
season in the Southern United States
starts roughly Memorial Day and so it
was probably early May miday that no no
no I take that back my bad it was April
because we were touring he already had
lots of contacts among all the
independently owned orchards in South
Carolina and so we went around
physically to meet face to face all the
families that own these Orchards so that
we could reserve you know parts of their
Harvest because that's kind of how it's
done I knew at that time I was not going

[07:01]
done I knew at that time I was not going
to be a small player we were going to be
like you know Tractor Trailer Load sort
of player and so when you're that big
you need to go and reserve the Harvest
you know before it ever starts is
already reserved by other resellers or
suppliers or Brokers essentially yeah
how big was the business when you got
there in April what had he been doing it
and how long had he been doing it he had
been doing it for probably five or six
years he had only ever grown it to about
I think at the height he had done maybe
five stands and he was doing it with his
children also he had two kids or he
still has two kids and that's the
business that they grew up in and
learned entrepreneurial skills and
management and you know all of that kind
of financial responsibility
accountability so he grew it to five
stands and I think he said the most he
was profiting so this is probably
like 2005 to 200 12 roughly so he was

[08:02]
like 2005 to 200 12 roughly so he was
profiting probably about 100 Grand 150
Grand just over stands in four month
months three months three months when
the season starts into may it will go
all the way roughly to Memorial Day or
sorry Labor Day Memorial Day to Labor
Day that's how the season runs how long
is a work day a work day at the stand is
10 hours we do 10 hours to five hour
shifts so it goes from 10 to seven or 9
to six you know however okay and these
are mostly like State highways just
right along the road yes so our favorite
location and still is today is to
collocate inside a very busy convenience
store gas station not inside but sorry
on on the premise so in their parking
lot because what we found in the casino
business and I ended up working with a
lot that's a whole another story but I

[09:00]
lot that's a whole another story but I
learned how cons um convenience stores
work and convenience stores are
beautiful because when they're
independent and local their radius is
only three to five miles so a
convenience store is only pulling from
from a neor you know from a radius of
three to five miles and so that was
perfect for us because we could put up a
peach s in that convenience store then
go three miles away and put up another
one and they would not cannibalize or
compete against each other so we we
would look for really really high TR
traffic convenient stores and and you
know over the years I got more
sophisticated and started using do
Department of Transportation you know
car counts in order to proactively
select locations which is what I do
today but back then we were just kind of
eyeballing it and so that and so we
would just negotiate just a real minimum
basic rental rate with the convenience
store and all we did was throw up a
10x10 tent you know a couple Lifetime

[10:00]
10x10 tent you know a couple Lifetime
Table six foot table yeah yeah a couple
of folding tables some chairs I mean it
was not fancy yeah still to say then we
did only cash only today especially
since Co we've had to really migrate to
accepting cashless uh payment apps and
credit card debit card okay so now we do
both this gas station unlock was huge
because you didn't care if a gas station
was four or five miles apart you're not
going to cannibalize yourself because
that's just not how consumer Behavior
Works correct cor you are exactly
correct yeah somebody who lives in the
neighborhood with convenience store a is
not going to patronize convenience store
B which is four miles away okay only if
it's on their drive but rarely so we
found that that helped us access the
immediate neighborhood and so then we
could just pop up you know all over town
and that's how we grew to have 100

[11:01]
and that's how we grew to have 100
stands I mean it was really logistically
it's a little challenging servicing that
many and you know some of them are dogs
some of them are winners and some of
them are just like okay and so we were
constantly there was an attrition so we
were constantly taking stands down and
putting stands up over that entire
summer I learned there were certain
thresholds and criteria that would make
a stand really profitable and if I
didn't see the results within three
weeks I knew I'll just pull it down and
go reset somewhere so I have so many
questions all right so you go in there
you spend like 4 seconds learning and
then you're like let's scale this yeah
which is what I would have done yeah
like that's for sure what I would have
done and is he is your Mentor is he cool
with that is he trust trusting of you to
do this he he was we we were and are
actually still just really good friends
and so he was and he is the such a
generous person he placs Santa Claus
every year he physically looks like

[12:01]
every year he physically looks like
Santa Claus and he's just a real
generous person and and he was getting
of an age
where it's it's really intensive labor
you know unless you have a lot of help
and so he was getting to an age where
the the the amount of Labor physical
labor required was not of interest to
him anymore and so he was willing to
just kind of hand over the Legacy the
Reigns because his kids were out you
know one of them is a pastor now the
other one is a a stay-at-home mom and so
his kids were not that interested in
that Legacy but me I was like hell yeah
this thing is an ATM machine all day
every day how did you find him again he
worked for our company the the casino
gaming company he came in as a Salesman
and okay I I learned so many sales
techniques from him yeah it was awesome
do the sales techniques make a big
difference on how well a stand does or
is it more about Lo they do location is

[13:01]
is it more about Lo they do location is
critical because just like you know in
prior to social media visibility is key
so you know in the old days in the I
don't know 20s 50s
7s motorists would Vis you know visibly
have to see the stand with their
eyeballs and that's that's it that's the
only way you knew a stand was there and
so there is this unlocked is a very good
description I unlocked this
Collective memory inside the American
psyche which people whether or not
they've ever been to a roadside stand
there's a collective memory that that
means happiness that means FR that means
local that means excellent quality
there's just this Collective memory and
people are primed this is what's so
beautiful about this business and
there's so few businesses I find in the
US that that have this same attractive

[14:00]
US that that have this same attractive
quality which is the consumer primed for
the transaction before they ever even
get into the entt and experience what's
there they just visibly see the image of
an apple the image of a peach or a
watermelon and they see a tent and they
know W all right I'm stopping and so
visibility was the number one criteria
for all of the stands that we did and
it's still the number one criteria today
has to have visibility
it has to have real simple symbolic
signage signage is key also so they have
to be able I mean all you have to do is
H truly have an image of a peach or
watermelon you know out on the out on
the roadway and that will cause people
to turn around that's how we started
today the the business model is for me
and my son is really transitioning so we
still do all of the roadside stands
now we're taking this whole concept

[15:02]
now we're taking this whole concept
online so we are starting to do a lot
more online sales we started shipping
things we have started doing we brought
our we're doing vertical integration is
what we with what we're doing so the
only thing we're not going to do ever is
Farm because I I just don't have the the
appetite for that but we started doing
our own delivery services so we we have
subscribers who subscribe to us and we
we go we have a fleet of kids that go
goes out and delivers you know Farm
boxes and produce to our customers so
the online element now has really
unlocked a whole new level of following
for us and it's we've created this
almost insatiable raving fan base online
and it just grows and grows and grows
every day and people track us down all
over the Metroplex wherever we are and
they'll just be like are you the
roadside stand are you the roadside
stand you know because they've seen us
on social media they're excited to
they're excited for the

[16:01]
they're excited for the
experience okay I want to get back to
that but I still have so many questions
so first of all like I'm a peach
afficionado I'm a fruit freak like I
love fruit I talk about it on this
podcast all the time like I used to save
up money as a nine-year-old selling used
golf balls so I could go buy peaches
right like I love peaches it's my number
one fruit what's like and I've had
roadside peaches they're delicious I
like my peaches hard like I like them
crunchy and big and like there's a
certain point in the season when they're
just outrageous and like I'll literally
buy tens of dollars worth of peaches
every other day just to keep my Supply
full because there's just a unique
flavor about them and then it go it's
gone where's what like I shop at Walmart
in Whole Food sometimes usually Walmart
like where what's different about these
peaches what's aren't they all coming
from the same Farms yes and no so what
happens in agriculture like with these
Farms particularly or Orchards so there

[17:00]
Farms particularly or Orchards so there
are there are some orchards in the US
who exclusively grow peaches for
commercial destinations like grocery
stores right there's something that's
called in the business a number one so a
number one when it when it's talking
about a fruit or a vegetable means
that's the highest quality and it's the
prettiest it's the most visually
appealing and so those number ones like
peaches that are just beautiful and
round no no marring on the skin right no
splotchy coloring those go to the
grocery store and so when an orchard
knowing the commercial destination Picks
Them early and then they immediately go
into Cold Storage so they're in deep
cold storage and you know big cold
lockers they're on cold reefer trucks
trains whatever getting to the
destination and then once they get there
then they're in Cold Storage however
longer what we do we sell the stuff we
sell the number twos so this is fruit

[18:02]
sell the number twos so this is fruit
that is not destined ever for a grocery
store so it doesn't get refrigerated
it's cheaper it's cheaper it's ugly the
orchard just wants to offload it and so
they don't go through the expense to
refrigerate it so it's more delicious
because it's not in Cold Storage that's
correct that is which like app apples
the same thing right yes yes and and
with stone fruit like a peach it will
continue to ripen after it's picked and
so when you when you put it in cold
storage for a long time it aborts that
whole process that's why there's no
flavor at a grocery store and what
happens a lot of times to Consumers is
when you get a peach and you think I'll
put it on the counter and it'll get ripe
well if it's been in Cold Storage a
month two months it's never going to get
ripe it's just going to rot it's Meely
starts getting leathery yes yes you'll
see the leathery skin which means it's
dehydr at the the the meat of the peach

[19:02]
dehydr at the the the meat of the peach
is real mey and you the texture is real
different not good and it'll start
turning brown from the inside out so
towards the pit it'll turn brown to the
outside and so that's an in all of those
are indicators been in Cold Storage way
too long so for us we get produce that's
not refrigerated now it may come from
the orchard you know depending on the
broker so that's the middleman between
the Orchard and me I mean I mean a lot
of times I will just broker and
negotiate directly with the orchard but
not all all Orchards will sell to me as
a resaler so sometimes I have to go
through a broker to get peaches anyway
sometimes the broker will put the
Peaches on a cold storage truck a reefer
to get them to Dallas and then once they
come off they're never in Cold Storage
again so they get sweeter so that that's
what happens that's that's the main
reason why peaches are so much better at
like one of my stands or or just a
country stand no no

[20:01]
country stand no no
Refrigeration that's just that's it
there just not in cold storage for a
month or two that's the that's the
different same Farm different process
yes interesting yes and I I would
imagine yours are smaller too right is
is there a correlation there feels like
roadside stand peaches are smaller well
and it depends on the time of season so
again a little lesson in Orchard
agriculture here
Orchard the reason our growing season is
so long in the US like from Memorial Day
to Labor Day is because an orchard will
plant 25 different
varietals in a single Orchard and so on
you know May 15th they're
harvesting red flame peaches and then
two weeks later they're harvesting June
princes and then two weeks later they're
harvesting red Globes and so it goes and
so it goes and so it goes and and as the
season right wears on the beaches are
getting bigger and bigger and bigger and

[21:01]
getting bigger and bigger and bigger and
bigger because it's later in the season
they get more sun you know that they're
just on the tree perhaps a little bit
longer and so they get bigger and and
with orch orchards
will prune the blooms the blossoms off
of the trees so that the peaches will
grow biger B yeah yes and so they get
more sunlight right and and when the
peaches are real small they're probably
competing for for Sun
yeah that essentially to answer your
question it just depends on the time of
the year yes on the front end peaches
are usually smaller and then at the end
of the season you're getting the big
softball size ones that you probably
like I eat like I will literally eat
four a day of the softball size ones and
I won even think
twice yeah all right what do the margins
look like on these both for directly
from a farm and from a broker a huge
line dividing line in profitability is
like the

[22:00]
like the
Mississippi and so anyone east of the
Mississippi has a much higher margin
than me because I got to get them across
the Mississippi over you know over this
way so they're their their my profit
margin is smaller it depends
on how good the Harvest is so
geographically that that determines how
profitable we are whether the Harvest
was good that year you know last year
was horrible Georgia l lost like 90% of
its crop because of uh late season
freeze and so the cost of peaches was
astronomical last year for peaches come
in what they call bushels right um most
most agriculture is in a Bushell that's
how they measure it and so peachin will
come in a half bushel case which is a 25
pound case so for me you know normally
I'm paying about I would say anywhere
from 2018
to $32 for a case a 25 pound case of

[23:03]
to $32 for a case a 25 pound case of
peaches that's pretty normal for us west
of the Mississippi east of the
Mississippi they're paying like 12
to15 holy cow yeah for the same 50 cents
a
pound crazy profit margins because when
I that's where I started was in North
South Carolina so we were gettinga we
were getting the same cases of peaches
for like 12 bucks and the profits were
much higher and now for us here in Texas
me right I'm like if I get a case for
$32 or $28 I'm like oh that's good all
right if you are watching this clip
right now you are watching this on
YouTube and if you are a fan of podcast
please check out my podcast while you're
at it because sometimes I have podcasts
that aren't on YouTube and sometimes I
have YouTubes that aren't on podcast so
check out the ker office on any podcast
platform or you can go to TKO pod.com
also my newsletter will throw that in
there there are no ads It's weekly it's
different content than my podcast and
YouTube newsletter. Christ jer.com
you'll see the link and we'll see you

[24:00]
you'll see the link and we'll see you
there last year I was paying $48 a case
because the Harvest was so bad but this
tells you there's so much profitability
in it because we were still making money
at $48 a case did you raise prices I did
last year yep okay all right so now
let's talk prices so what do you charge
and how do you how do you charge for I I
made a conscious decision based off of
what my mentor taught me Rob
that he would actually sell peaches by
the pound but he displayed them in in
what's called a PE basket yeah like the
I know what you're talking about yeah
like the woven kind of yes yeah I'm
sitting in front of a bunch of Peck
baskets I have a ton of produce right
here in front of me so he would sell
them in the PE baskets and I was like
okay so what I began to understand about
the consumer mindset is if I didn't sell
them by the pound I would break that
pattern in their mind and so then I
could charge in a different way and so

[25:02]
could charge in a different way and so
consumers started coming to the stands
and they understand oh this isn't a
pricing model by the pound because I
don't want to I don't want to be
compared to Walmart or any of the other
bb or anybody else I want how we price
and how we deliver to be unique and
exclusive to us so then I just started
charging by the basket and that totally
broke the mold it it interrupted their
pattern and people stopped asking me how
much is this per pound and and now they
just ask how much is this per basket so
on a case of peaches these 25b cases you
know I I calculate we can get like eight
baskets and we charge $15 a basket I
might pay I might pay oh man $28 to $32
over
here for a case of peaches and I'm I am
grossing about 120 bucks out of that
case when you know when the Harvest is
good when I can get the wholesale price
I'm looking for and the consumer doesn't

[26:01]
I'm looking for and the consumer doesn't
even blink yeah no they're there for the
experience and the Nostalgia and The
Taste and what was the effective price
per pound before like you know what I'm
saying how much did your Revenue go up
when you when you switch the model oh my
gosh or what is I guess what's your
effective price per pounds now like how
many pounds is a PEC I I guess I could
just divide like three pounds so the
small pecs that we use it's an eighth of
a PEC and so we usually put about 4 PBS
in there so we're charging $15 for a 4
PB sure Peck essentially and then you
dump the peck out in a bag right yeah
you keep it because I went to a stand
recently and I'm like whoa whoa I don't
get the peck what are we doing here yeah
give a brother a pack yeah the and I'll
tell you I did used to sell them so you
being in Texas you know where
Jacksonville is uhhuh so I go out there
a whole lot to buy produce my favorite
basket company in the US say was there
and they were called the Texas Basket

[27:00]
and they were called the Texas Basket
company and after
105 years they closed their doors this
March what yeah who's gonna get that
customer list South Carolina basket
company consumed their list and so now
if I want baskets fortunately because
I've done so many stands I have hundreds
of baskets but I don't I don't have the
option then to go shop at the store
because they would do unique things
anyway so that was a real that was a
real loss how much do the baskets cost
so the baskets when I got them from the
T Texas Basket company they would sell
them in a sleeve so we would get 20 25 I
can't remember in this big sleeve and we
would pay I mean they were
like
$2 $2 per basket and I think I think now
for me if I want to get them from South
Carolina they're probably closer to four
$4 per basket do people ever ask to buy
them at the stand all the time all the

[28:02]
them at the stand all the time all the
time and what which is why I had which
is another reason why I had so many
because I would sell them people want
them as a gift or I want the basket I'd
be like of course it's an extra whatever
two three dollar and they could buy yeah
so $4 a pound that's not outrageous like
I pay three at the grocery store you
know yeah and they're not as good it's
but your margins are better than the
grocery store is the thing a lot better
and they're good they're good they're
good all the produce here is good and
and people have learned with us it's not
a fight
to be heard or understood so you know
when you get stuff from the grocery
store and and you want to ask questions
about it what farm did this come from
how do I store it how do I know when
it's right how do I cook it we get to
answer all of those questions but then I
think more importantly when something
flat out isn't good or doesn't taste
good it's not a fight with us we we
don't care all you have to say is hey I
didn't like this great what else can I

[29:00]
didn't like this great what else can I
get you because just the nature of
produce you know it's not always going
to be good it's not always going to be
right and so it's been a little bit over
the years a training process to tell our
customers it's okay just say that this
sucked what you're not offending me at
all and we'll just replace it because we
don't have X-ray vision I don't know
that that watermelon is not any good
yeah you know now when you took over in
South Carolina was he putting stands in
gas stations or was he just kind of
roadside he was setting up in in the
parking lots of convenience so he was
doing that already yes now what's your
typical location like our I'm thinking
DFW right like we both of here like are
you are you on a state highway kind of
out in the ex herbs or are you like in
like Allen or Plano in in a gas station
which I'm sure you're all over but
what's your typical location so we've
done all of the above
when I when I when we first came back to

[30:00]
when I when I when we first came back to
Dallas Fort Worth I would open much
larger stands so we we have these
commercial sites tents that we get from
a wonderful tent company in Fuquay
Verina North Carolina called King Canopy
and these are hardcore industrial tents
and they go up at the beginning of the
season and they stay put we do not take
them down until Labor Day and so we
would go out into the country you know
in a real busy thorough Fair high
visibility and set up these really big
stands we might do a 10 by21 we might do
20 by 40 so just depending on the
traffic that we had you know because we
were putting big um Gaylords the big
watermelon bins cantal bins we just have
tons of stuff there so we've done those
we do we we have moved into the city
limits now I have a really good
relationship with the city of Fort Worth
and they're very except C in of like
popup produce people I've gotten to know

[31:01]
popup produce people I've gotten to know
them very well and so now it is
acceptable for me to set up inside the
city limits just on University Drive by
TCU for years we've had a stand really
close to TCU in the parking lot of Old
South Pancake House which is a really
high trffic Pancake House open you I
know that intersection there's so you
yeah we've been sitting there for years
there's like a hipster sandwich place
right there I think oh eat SE is across
the street which all the TCU kids love
so we've been set up there for years and
this last year was our last year there
because the city had University Drive
completely torn up and so they put all
these medians in I mean it was a
nightmare and customers could not get in
and out so now we're still on University
Drive but we're clustered down to the
Stockyards now we're in an actual
building we have become part of Pula
which is this old Mexican flea market

[32:01]
which is this old Mexican flea market
and so we're consuming some of their
real estate here to actually build out a
shoppable 247 Farmers Market we do a a
ton of farmers markets and Artisan
markets you know shop Sip and Shop type
stuff that works really well for us
during the summer I have an entire fleet
of kids that's when we're busiest and
we're you know we'll have our permanent
locations and then during the weekends
we're running maybe six to eight
different popups at simultaneously
because all the kids and these are high
school kids and college kids they'll
come get you know a tent a kit and
they'll go to the location and pop up
for the day and then they tear down and
bring everything back so we'll have lots
of kids doing that every year I do some
sort of new business segment so every
year we build a new line of business
onto the core which is the redside stand
two years ago I started working with

[33:01]
two years ago I started working with
homeowners associations because I wanted
to have what what's so attractive about
popups is you condense the number of
hours that you're open but you have the
highest traffic so I this happened
during covid when the HOAs were bringing
all of the food trucks into the
subdivision to cater to the residents
and so then I started working with
really highly populated residential
communities we could have a dedicated
audience for a short amount of time and
oh my gosh that was highly so in essence
we're doing mobile farmers markets now
we go into a neighborhood we're there
for two hours wham bam we do wow ,000 to
like $2500 worth of sales in two hours
and then we're packed up and we're out
and we try to roll those during our
slower days of the week which might be
Monday Tuesday Wednesday so we're doing
those types of mobile farmers markets

[34:01]
those types of mobile farmers markets
and now with our subscription service
model I'm getting into the really
high-end condo environments here in Fort
Worth so that not only can we introduce
ourselves and you can shop spontaneously
with us you know one day a month also
we'll take your subscription business so
that we can go one day a week to the
tradition which is our newest one it's a
independent living facility in clearfork
and we can just drop off all of the farm
boxes on a single day to all of the
residents there so that's that's so we
try to add I try to add some business
segment every single year onto that core
yeah what's like uh an outrageously
successful location what does that look
like on a daily sales basis or seasonal
I have a peach calculator so i' I've I
created this yeah a I I call my
framework the roadside riches framework
so if you want to learn how to do this
you know I do have a framework I have a

[35:01]
you know I do have a framework I have a
business blueprint of course I do so now
I have a peach calculator because what
was happening prior to covid is I was
teaching people just face Toof face
one-on-one mostly students how to do
this so that they could just work the
summer months and I'm still doing this
but so that they could work the three
months out of the Year earn enough money
to pay for tuition and or pay for all
their living expenses they don't have to
work during that Academic Year so the
peach calculator is designed with all of
the averages a good a good roadside
stand should
profit at minimum $1,000 a week I would
say the average this is profit not
growth sales profit should be 1,500 a
week that you're putting in your pocket
now a really good one a really good road
Tite stand is doing 2500 to 3500 in
profit a week so so that's one stand now
is that profit is that owner operated so

[36:01]
is that profit is that owner operated so
there's no employees we always have
employees especially when we're doing
right multiple stands and so I do our
payroll per stand will run about 700 a
week let's see I guarantee everybody I
guarantee the kids $20 an hour wow I
guarantee them that they make it you
know there's a tip Reserve there so they
get paid $15 an hour then they get tips
so really I guarantee that they're
getting 20 but they always make more
like 25 to 35 an hours what the kids end
up really making with their tips um and
so yeah my payroll per stand is about
700 okay so the profit is that's like
net profit you're paying someone to be
there correct correct yeah payroll is
just one of those overhead expense item
yeah now I didn't know if you had like
an independent contractor model where

[37:00]
an independent contractor model where
you were selling the peaches to them at
a markup I'd like to hear about that so
I do that as well I can be a broker
right for somebody so I can teach them
how to do it for themselves and then I
can just broker the produce to them they
pay me a flat fee in order to teach them
everything that they want to know how to
get started and then I can help them
broker all of the produce since I've
been doing it so long now I mean I know
all the orchards in the US and then
within Texas I certainly know all of the
independent Farms with which we can
negotiate produce like cantaloupe you
know and watermelon and all that stuff
what is the most outrageously profitable
stand you ever were a part of whether
South Carolina or here I would say so a
good day a good day is when you're doing
over 2,000 in sales so on the weekend
some of just on the weekend
some of our stands you know will do I

[38:00]
some of our stands you know will do I
mean they can do in excess to 5,000 in
gross sales one stand in two days or
three days two days two days Louise and
then what make like is it just the
location or like if you were to split it
up location and sales Acumen what's the
percentage on each so there is some
sales technique that's really relevant
and I I think what makes us so
successful and I get I get absolute
hammered and bitched out by other
Farmstand people because they feel like
I don't know I I'm doing some
some magical thing why am I so
successful and they're still struggling
you know to make $7 on some Tomatoes I
think a lot of people who are in
traditional produce people don't
understand is you have to create that
experience and then on top of that you
have to be able to tell a story right I
mean as a business person if you cannot
create value inside the customer's mind

[39:00]
create value inside the customer's mind
then they're not going to pay the $15
that you're
asking however if you do create the
value that they have no problem paying
it and so and I'm completely transparent
with everyone on the planet I do not
grow a thing I am a
reseller now that I've disclosed that to
you Jane and Joe Smith consumer let me
tell you about eords so eords is one of
my favorite Orchards in East Texas it's
in Pittsburgh Texas awesome peaches and
so I will go into the whole story about
this Orchard and the consumer gets the
story about the orchard so they feel
like ah now I know a little bit more
about this not only do we talk about and
I teach every kid who works for us this
that we call it storytelling selling you
need to be I tweeted about this
yesterday literally I said not tell your
story I said sell your story it is the
best sales pit you have there's y yes
storytelling selling that's what that's

[40:01]
storytelling selling that's what that's
what we call it and then so then on top
of knowing where the peach is from we
know when it was picked we know what the
flavor profile is like we know what the
varietal name is we know whether it's a
cling peach or a Freestone Peach I mean
we that's how you know this that's how
you become the authority in the expert
and so people will pay you for that
expertise so when you you present
yourself through storytelling as the
expert and the authority and then you
can create that value you can charge
whatever you want yeah and you're
creating more of a relationship with
them because you're you're talking
you're building Rapport and trust and
expertise like it's all in one yes yes
it reminds me of that Portlandia skit
have you seen that about the chicken
that was locally
s and they go out to the farm and they
watch oh gosh yeah my son Finn loves
that show yeah so are you able to get
the the peaches from eords uh at a

[41:01]
the the peaches from eords uh at a
better price since it's more local so
eords um Gary who R he's the he's now
the owner he's one of the orchard owners
who sells to a broker and so I cannot
buy directly from him yeah and I've
talked to him and I've met him several
times he's negotiated at some point in
the past to sell to a wholesaler in
Dallas oh gosh you should take a field
trip over there cuz I'm in constantly
will it's it's several wholesalers who I
really like but eford sells to one of
them and so I have to go to that guy
okay is real to get ord's peaches what
about
hams hams I can get direct from ham we
go there we take our kids there on tours
and yeah super cool yeah I can get
peaches direct from hams here west of
here and you you may not are you
familiar with Weatherford Parker Camp
okay so I worked directly with the
huttons who own that peach farm out

[42:00]
huttons who own that peach farm out
there and so I negotiate directly with
Jimmy who owns that farm so a lot of the
Orchards I just go that's my preference
because having the relationship with the
owner is far better yeah it's better
prices I can call them if I'm in a pinch
they'll help me out the Fulfillment is
easier it's just a it's just a lot
better all around there is a gas station
less than a mile from me that gets like
I'm a nerd I know traffic counts like I
like I know traffic can't and it gets
like 40,000 cars a day 50,000 maybe and
it's like it's only two lanes like it's
always backed up and there's no stand
there that would be a perfect location
for you exactly where where we just
located to now at Lula this old Mexican
flea market so oh you can't really see
our table here let's see oh here we are
yeah so this is one of our buildings
that we are putting together for the
farmers market and we're in the process
of building out but what I was going to

[43:00]
of building out but what I was going to
say is the intersection up
here there's a huge Shell at this corner
the traffic count I think is
50,000 a day wow yeah the thing about
this intersection is there's literally
only one gas station there's no other
businesses like it all goes through this
one I want to sell peaches there
speaking of that what do like what do
your terms look like with a gas station
can you bounce in a month if it's no
good is it is it just a flat fee yes so
typically what we do is we we negotiate
a flat rate with and and it's all open
just to negotiation there's no we we
never have any formal agreements it's
just handshake deals gas stations we do
like $25 a day per like parking space so
we found this other interesting model
Chris totally up topic an app called to
go too good to let go too good to let go
too good to go whatever it is and so
when you have leftover stuff you put it

[44:01]
when you have leftover stuff you put it
on the app and that way people within
proximity um can find you and they can
come get their surprise goodie bag and
so if we ever have leftover produce I
put it on the app and then people just
show up and there's nobody else doing
fruits and vegetables and so the the
list to get on are leftover produce is
huge I mean it's just really long so we
constantly have people trying to get
leftovers from us some places have been
far more expensive you know when we were
at the Pancake House the owner there
lovely guy he wanted a lot more and I
did not have a problem paying him
because it was such a good spot close to
TCU and that's in a very affluent
Corridor you know but then when the
traffic the construction got too nuts
I'm like this this is worth it so that's
why we looked for another place and now
where we are it I mean it's nominal the
the fee to be here is so low
it's not much at all what do you have
under your umbrella today like how many

[45:01]
under your umbrella today like how many
stands are do you have your hands in so
now we're really in the off season it is
since peach season is over we we
collapse down all of our stands and it
just normally I am not open this late
what we are doing though now is is
expanding our business segment in this
offseason period so that we can continue
to build the whole you know holistic
business model so that we can take what
is truly seasonal business you know uh
May through September and build it to 12
months or at least 10 months out of the
year there's not much going during
January and February because you know
it's it's the winter time there's not
much to sell so right now what we do is
we do a lot of mobile farmers markets so
during the weekdays we're going out to
HOAs we're going to condo associations
we're doing
those committed popups and then we have

[46:03]
those committed popups and then we have
our then we have our store here that we
keep open and then on the weekend we do
farmers market plus we we're having our
store open okay so you're you're kind of
more focused right now on teaching
others how to do this and kind of being
a broker for them and then like is it
accurate to say kind of shrinking your
footprint and trying to be more
condensed in DFW as opposed to having a
zillion stands everywhere I I I am I am
after 11 years now it it is a lot of
physical labor I mean and during the the
PE the peak of the peach season you know
it's gosh I mean it's easily 80 hour
weeks when you're doing that many
locations you know just the logistics of
the thing what about the peach truck
that company what do you know much about
them yeah the peach truck they're based
out of Nashville and so what they have
done they say that they 60 locations
around Nashville and what they do is

[47:00]
around Nashville and what they do is
they are popping up inside physically
inside another business and I think what
they do is kind of Consignment without
knowing exactly that business model I
think they do a consignment so they may
have peaches in a cake shop or something
right and then that that business is
selling the product taking the sales and
then splitting it with the peach truck
so they may only have one or two
dedicated popup tents around Nashville
and the rest is Consignment is what I
think they are doing now what they have
really moved to and they got an influx
of capital maybe a year or two is
they're truly dedicated to truck sales
so they work with Titan Farms which is
the largest peach orchard in the US and
they're in South Carolina and they have
like 7,000 Acres of peach trees jeez and
so they are the peach truck is just
consuming
that Harvest and then you know they do

[48:01]
that Harvest and then you know they do
pre- sales you have to RSVP and do a
pre-sale with the peach truck in advance
of the Harvest and then they will roll
out and now they they actually have
logistically they have warehouses here
here in DFW because they'll have little
10 foot box trucks rolling out to do
deliveries for them so now they're
they're doing satellite warehouses and
these really populous areas okay
interesting man well this was amazing I

order to pay for school and so we during
