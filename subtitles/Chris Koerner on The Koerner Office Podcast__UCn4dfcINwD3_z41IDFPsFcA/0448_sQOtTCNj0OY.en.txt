[00:00]
you build a mobile private jet studio
for everyone on Instagram that wants to
flex their pictures and videos in a
private jet it's completely fake if
people want to be vain they want to pay
me $80 an hour to take pictures inside
of a fake private jet I'm happy to
oblige I'm obsessed with the idea of
starting a business where math is on
your side train your algorithm we're
thoughtlessly like letting the
algorithms train us but we've got to
tell the algorithm what we want and
it'll show us if you're listening to
this and you want to make more money
please DM us we have the idea is we just
need people to execute on building the
software for the use
[Music]
cases so I have a literal headache right
now I just got done talking to my good
friend Sam Thompson he's a recurring
guest I've had him on six or eight times
wow you're going to love this I promise
you're going to love it it was 50/50
between internet businesses and Home
Service businesses it's going to be
split into two episodes the next one
will be exactly a week from today so
come back and listen to that this was
really really good okay I'm not
overhyping it you're going to love it we
did no prep there was no Google doc open

[01:00]
did no prep there was no Google doc open
in another tab we just started riffing
on ideas and we came up with some really
cool stuff let me know what you think
please like And subscribe share with a
friend we'll see you next time so what
kind of software is good to you right
now prosumer software explain to like I
know what it means Sam like what
obviously I'm
gen other people might not I like
prosumer products in general
specifically software because you can
when I say prosumer I mean real estate
agents content
creators music Ians right people that
can be targeted via marketing and
advertising as if they are a consumer
but they are making a purchase decision
as a investment right as a I'm trying to
grow right if you can lead with the
aversion of make more money as like your
offer but if you broaden that up to a
prosumer market your Tam is huge right
versus like hey we sell software to

[02:01]
versus like hey we sell software to
whatever B2B companies that are doing
north of a million dollars like you say
that and your Tam shrinks like you're
just so small and it's really hard to
find a decision maker right you're just
like you're you're playing in a
different game versus in a in a prosumer
landscape you can run Facebook ads for
you can run Facebook ads for anything
ever but like when you're talking about
a sizable market like that's where
Facebook ads comes in right like there's
you know whatever it is three million
real estate agents in the United States
and it's like we can go after those
people with ads for something whether
that is you know software info anything
that is designed to sell to that market
and like you can find them via ads but
they make the decision around making
more money or growing more leads or
whatever that is and then I just like
software because recurring Revenue
higher multiple lower bar yeah it's like
lower lower barrier to entry now than
there ever has been I mean like we've
thought like I've sold micras companies

[03:00]
thought like I've sold micras companies
that have built with no code like it's
not I don't have to go you know hire
five developers and spend 100 Grand to
do this anymore and so like we can go
spin up the software in a day and a half
test it on the market get validation and
then go run ads at that and like trust
that as long as we run it as at break
even acquisition you don't need Venture
funding and then you have recurring rev
that's software and you can go get a 4
to 6X break even on l TV on first
month's Revenue yeah I mean if you want
to create like an aggressive up and the
right growth you have to get break even
on first month because break even on LTV
doesn't do anything for you that means
you're just like spending all the time
and energy for no profit whatsoever
unless you have like an aggressive
referral campaign or or high upsells
sure yeah yeah if you're GNA if you're
going to segment out all of your users
based on that and you can you can get a
viral coefficient to two or three then
yeah you could break even LTV on the on
the top but explain to us what a viral

[04:02]
the top but explain to us what a viral
coefficient is when I think about viral
coefficient it's basically like I
acquire one user but acquiring one user
equals x number of users based on
average referral and so like for a lot
of companies it's a it's a super
underrated way to make your marketing
campaigns more profitable because if you
can turn say you're acquiring customers
for 10 bucks right but if you can turn
one acquisition into
1.8 right you just improved all your
metrics across the board and so I think
in general like referral is one of the
channels that I mean people just need to
like focus on it more right like you
already have especially when you're
talking I get not wanting to do it as
much when you're smaller but like when
you have a thousand customers if you can
go get you know 20% of those to refer to
friends it's like you know you're
bumping it by 40% like you're you're
starting to like feel that okay okay so

[05:00]
starting to like feel that okay okay so
three examples that come to mind when
you talk about a viral coefficient viral
referral marketing PayPal Robin Hood
coinbase and all of them it was like 10
bucks Robin hoods was genius because
Robin oh Robin hoods was so genius they
had one of the most viral marketing
campaigns of all time they've had
several but like the second or third one
was refer a friend get a free stock
right right and it's like the stock was
like $650 $6.50 but it's like oh what if
it 10x what if it 10x
it's it's more valuable than 6
realistically most of the companies that
were willing to let Robinhood give away
their free stocks were companies you
really wouldn't want to invest in but it
didn't matter no people likeed like the
they wanted to get into the game for
free and so they would do it and then
you know they go to the party and it's
like yeah I'm I'm investing in stocks
now so that's like the fle but that's
really what people are paying for dude
but PayPal did it first I feel like like
sign up for PayPal and get $10 send

[06:00]
sign up for PayPal and get $10 send
every friend you get to sign up for
PayPal and you get $10 yeah and then
coinbase did it and it was always $10
like they never have to spend more than
$10 but what's the LTV lifetime value of
a coinbase or a Robin Hood user 500
5,000 yeah I mean massive yeah it's like
yeah it's again like you said I like the
word asymmetric like yeah we'll pay x
amount for this if it equals a 500x and
especially with with Venture back like
they can support a much longer cash
conver cycle on that which is why I lean
to wanting Break Even acquisition like
month one is like you you then alleviate
the need for cash because your cash
conversion cycle is 30 days or less most
of the time you would want it to be you
know whatever your trial if you're doing
a trial your trial length and so like a
7-Day trial let's say you're selling a
$30 product $30 a month and it's like
cool you can get trial signups for five
bucks as long as one of six of those
trials converts you get that cash back

[07:02]
trials converts you get that cash back
in your account say it's a 7-Day trial
like within seven days and so you can
you can acquire four users for the same
$30 because you're just using that same
dollar amount every single time and so
you can shorten the cash conversion
cycle and accelerate your spend if you
know that it's break even because like
if I can get Break Even acquisition
month one I'm throwing the farm at that
funnel right like I'm I'm going to get
all my money back within seven days so
yeah I'm going to go spend $10,000 this
week on ads acquire that all of those
users and still end the week with
$10,000 in my account and so if you just
function the the ad funnel like that and
just pay attention to the cash
conversion it's I mean money what are
some creative ways let's brainstorm
because I feel like like in fintech it
this has been done right like give away
$10 for referring every user but I feel
like people just aren't creative enough

[08:00]
like people just aren't creative enough
myself included with taking what PayPal
did and copying and pasting it with
anything else what are some creative
ways that we could leverage a viral
marketing a referral marketing campaign
that's not in fintech all referral comes
down to is like incentive alignment on
both the referrer and the refer and so
like the ones that we've seen work the
best which like you know Robin Hood's a
good example Dropbox was like an OG of
the dual-sided incentive program right
like forget exactly what it was but they
gave you like one gigabyte of free data
and if you for every friend that you
referred you got one free and then your
friend would get an extra one for free
and so like the dual-sided
incentive seems to work yeah pretty well
I mean even even the marginal cost of an
additional gigabyte to them is nothing
the value to you might be $5 a month
right the cost to them might be 5 cents
a month right and so it's like yeah it's
just figuring those pieces of it out I
think the other I mean d du sided is

[09:00]
think the other I mean d du sided is
where we try to live like even like the
link that I just gave you for Creative
OS like we're saying we're going to pay
you and your audience will get 50% off
your first month right like dual-sided
versus one or the other and we've just
seen that work a lot better especially
especially when you're dealing with like
bigger Affiliates like they want to feel
special they need something that's not
just like hey sign up for this thing
it's like hey no no no sign up for this
thing because you get this benefit you
know in home Serv and and a couple what
I would call more traditional offers I
think that it gets I don't know it's
it's like you know a lot of home service
companies like have started to introduce
like a monthly maintenance plan or like
in not insurance but like hey if you pay
99 a month you get you know priority
scheduling or you get whatever that
looks like and I feel like that's one of
those things that the marginal cost is
is low right but like hey we like you
sign your friend up
like you both get a free year of our Pro

[10:03]
like you both get a free year of our Pro
whatever and then as the business owner
you just have to be cognizant of like
you said to Dropbox this point like what
are the things that that are high
perceived value to the end user that you
don't have that much cost associated
with and so like I don't know I think
there's in home service specifically I
think that
there's a world where you could do
will'll offer you you know
quarterly
HVAC maintenance
check-ins right which like yeah it takes
your employees time but if you position
those the right way like that's just a
sales opportunity for your team of like
yeah you're going to go out to every
single past client's home every quarter
every six months whatever it is and do
an audit of their HVAC system them and

[11:00]
an audit of their HVAC system them and
you'll find a few things that they
probably should do and like but they get
the perceived benefit of this free
system check or whatever you want to
call that and so there's stuff like that
that I think is interesting I got some
examples for you first of all I just
heard about this handyman in the
Northeast somewhere and his specialty is
like kind of like farm and ranch homes
nice homes not like big mansions not new
homes but older homes on acreage that
are worth like 1.5 to $3 million that
they're kind of quirky they might have a
septic system they got a lot of things
that can break right and he he was doing
fine as a handyman but he implemented a
monthly fee that was paid yearly yep
$1,200 a year Y and it basically put you
at the top of the line anytime you had
anytime yeah and these were specif this
is how Niche it was not just like Farm
and Ranch tile homes 1.5 to three
million on acreage but those were all
rentals as well so there was a septic
issue a sprinkler issue something that
you know the furnace goes out
he will be there immediately and like

[12:02]
he will be there immediately and like
it's more of like an insurance policy
yeah I was going to say like if you're
in a if you're in an area that has a
sizable amount of like a rental market
that's a no-brainer like go after every
single property owner that has rentals
Airbnb right that like a broken septic
is a headache whether you live in the
house or not but like if you're a
landlord and that happens you're
specifically annoyed you know what I
mean like you really want to get that
fixed because like it's costing you
money it's just an issue right like the
whole thing I think there's a world
because then you just go to all the
rental management
companies right like you go to the guy
that's like like a Airbnb management or
whatever but like there's these big you
know rental spots that like manage all
of these like owner rentals and it's
like you go to those guys where they
have you know 15 25 properties that
they're managing on behalf of the owner
and it's like yeah 1,200 bucks a pop and

[13:02]
and it's like yeah 1,200 bucks a pop and
like you'll get priority maintenance
like same day guarantee right like you
can you can really craft an offer there
it's like you get a 100 properties under
that and like all right cool it's 120k a
year like just on that I'm obsessed with
the idea of starting a business where
math is on your side right like did you
see my video about the whole in-one
challenge yeah dude in New Zealand I was
looking it up because I was like dude I
don't know where I could get the living
in La Land and like the ability to do
that is is limited but I was like dude
why don't I get a box truck and put a
simulator in there that's exclusively
for the challenge like just for that
challenge one whole golf simulator in a
box truck you pay 10 bucks for 10 balls
you know what I mean like save I'm a big
that you want to this is totally a
tangent bro but like box truck
businesses I'm trademarking it here live

[14:01]
businesses I'm trademarking it here live
on let's see if that domain's open but
like I love I love where this is going
box truck business truck buses.com dude
why isn't there a golf simulator in the
back of a Bo box truck that's fully
wrapped it has to look legit or you're
you're afraid you get kidnapped I'm
saying that rolls up to festivals that
has like
1999 or $999.99 you hop in there for 30
minutes and just golf why is that a
thing look I am on the same name page I
think so there was this dude when I was
living in Boston my barber and I were
talking about this guy this years ago
but he he got a I don't know if it was a
box truck but maybe maybe like a mobile
home or whatever that is and he
retrofitted it out as a barber shop and
all he would do is Monday through Friday
he'd pick a different massive corporate
campus and go park it right outside and
everyone would come down throughout the
day and get their haircut in his truck
in the parking lot of their office
building it's genius brilliant like

[15:00]
building it's genius brilliant like
absolutely doesn't have time to step
away from their desk for a half hour for
a half hour and so he would be booked up
solid every single day five days a week
chilling so genius all and and like no
rent cost like sure gas and insurance
but like you're paying for that stuff
you know what I mean it was like yeah
and so it's a box truck business and
like the food trucks are massive right
like they are everywhere like mobile
restaurant the math makes sense like
cool like there are with it but like
cool and so I've just been thinking
about what else can I put in a box truck
and the other one that I thought about
was a mobile podcast Studio dude you get
a box truck you put the camera set up
the whole thing in the back and then you
just let people book you two hours in
DFW you roll up you've got a technician
there you just say hey we're going to
film The Pod you know what I mean and
it's like you can charge for pods you
can charge2 200 an hour for you to be

[16:01]
can charge2 200 an hour for you to be
able to film record and then don't even
get me started on the upsells for
Digital Services that you can put on the
back end and like you know every single
podcast guy that you have coming in film
you say hey we'll edit all your Tik toks
and your reals right like and it's all
built on the back of what a let's just
say a 20 to $30,000 investment to
retrofit a box truck that people can sit
in in the back and film a pod or like
same with this dude with the barber shop
like you're buying a couple barber
chairs in a me like or dude dude you
freaking you build out a a mobile barber
shop and then you rent it out to Barbers
BR that don't have 30 grand that's what
I'm saying like I'm I'm in this vein
similar similar line to me going and and
getting this new office we exist in this
super digital world and there's so much
benefit that comes from the digital
world what I'm interested in curious
about paying attention to is how do you
leverage a singular like high
intentional like physical

[17:00]
intentional like physical
asset that then feeds digital right
where it's like the podcast thing like
if I if I ran
a podcast editing agency the first thing
that I would try to do is launch a
dedicated physical podcast studio in a
major Metro where there's a high
population of entrepreneurs and then I
would use that to one like it's almost
like a loss leader Costco chicken right
like people can come through record
their pod you let them do for 150 bucks
an hour when the rest of the market is
at 250 but you have all the additional
services that are way higher margin on
the back end and so I feel the exact
same way
around this podcast Studio around the
barber shop around like there are things
that like a physical asset enables to
move in the digital world and like yeah
I just think it's interesting like and
they're not that expensive the more the
world is online the more having a
physical presence is a flex I know you

[18:00]
physical presence is a flex I know you
standing out I know and it doesn't have
to be an expensive presence but dude my
mind is just buzzing right now I'm like
I'm like flipping out well there's like
oh so the the other one that's an OG we
used to do them we had one for like my
boy's like 12th birthday party the game
trucks right like the game truck
business one of those right where they
roll up with the trailer they've got
four TVs and four Xboxes G every
neighbor kid is begging his mom for it
after everyone wants to run it like they
just park the things at storage units
like the the unit that I had when I was
living in Dallas that I kept all my
stuff here in La had six game trucks
parked in the back I think that that's a
a brilliant model like and I think the
differentiator really and the why I like
the podcast one is like if you can
extend Revenue outside of the Restraint
of the physical thing because like
physical things have built-in restraints
you have one podcast Studio you can only
have 10 hours of Total booking so you're
limited Revenue wise if 10 people come
and film a podcast that you're Studio
every single week and you can convert

[19:00]
every single week and you can convert
two of those to $2,000 a month for
podcast management clip editing guest
Outreach right like there's a slew of
additional add-on Digital Services that
you can do it record for free and upsell
20% of them at $2500 a month for podcast
editing or agency services and you can
do all of that for less than 20 30 grand
to like build this asset which then you
can use in content you can you know what
I mean like there's just like an
interesting there's an interesting World
there and I think the box truck I've
just been calling them box truck
businesses in my head like I think and
it goes back to what we've talked about
on a bunch of these episodes that we've
done before it's like there's a lot of
businesses that like can very
comfortably make You2 200 to $300,000 a
year that like don't require that much
like is a box truck podcast Studio going
to be you know a $5 million a year
business no but if you're making $60,000
as a marketing manager at BM it's like

[20:01]
as a marketing manager at BM it's like
and you can go make 180 a year like at
running this mobile podcast studio to me
that feels like a good a good move all
right I got too many ideas you gotta let
me run I'm gonna run okay I'm here all
right first of all I've seen the mobile
Barber Shop idea before and it's like
okay that's cool I might do a reel about
it one day and it's like it's cool what
you said is a perfect example of taking
a good idea and making it a great idea
by adding distribution to it simply
parking it outside of a big office
complex right you wrap it because it's
got to look professional it's got to
look nice and then you can put one of
those like those moving digital
Billboards on the side of it you know
and you could roll up outside of like an
oracle office and say like hey 20% off
for all Oracle employees today only
right and it looks like that truck is
there for Oracle like as far as they
know oracle commissioned that truck to
be there one big QR code on the side
that goes directly to the booking link
and call it a day yeah and guess what
20% off of what they don't know what

[21:02]
20% off of what they don't know what
your prices are yeah like 20% off of
whatever you want it's an Impulse buy
and then they get their haircut with you
you get their name number and email you
tell everyone a month later exactly and
then every time you go to that office
building it's going to be easier and
easier and easier and either you have a
line every time or you raise your prices
and then then you layer in a dual-sided
incentive program and say hey if you ref
refer a friend they get a free beer and
you get a free beer during your next
haircut at the register hey I'm going to
take 10 10 bucks off right now but I
want you to text your office buddies and
tell them that we're down here right and
then show me your text right right then
dude all right then there's this company
okay so Sprinter vans as long as they're
the same year making model they're all
the same right of course they are
there's this company that will make like
a shell and they'll build whatever you
want or need inside of that Sprinter van
shell and then you can just put it up on
a lift and you can put it in your Sprint
so hear me out M you build like a mobile

[22:01]
so hear me out M you build like a mobile
barber shop in a shell and you roll up
say Tuesdays and Thursdays you cut hair
you come back to the shop back to the
garage back to the storage unit you take
the shell out and then I just did
research on this a few hours ago so it's
fresh you build a mobile private jet
Studio H yeah hell yeah for everyone on
Instagram that wants to flex there
pictures and videos in a private jet
it's completely fake would I do it no
would you do it no but would I profit
from it
absolutely if people want to be vain
they want to pay me $80 an hour to take
pictures inside a private fake private
jet I'm happy to oblig right so either
it's two different businesses or it's
the same business you just get different
conversions on this little shell and
just pop it in and out of the same
Sprinter van I guess the difference is
you got to WRA certain yeah that is the
Difference Maker so anyway dude like
your private jet fake studio is a much
bigger Market than your podcast idea
not that it's bigger or better or it's

[23:00]
not that it's bigger or better or it's
just different it's a different price
point right right it and it's an Impulse
buy so if you're like a 32y old
Millennial that wants to flex and you're
walking by shopping and you see it you
might never be the person to be so vain
as to go search and to book and to pay
and to drive and go to a studio and by
the way there's only like two or three
of these in the country right right
there's like New York and La that's it
but if you walk by one and it's
convenient and it's right there it could
be like a gag gift like
you could post a picture of it just as a
joke like knowing that it's fake you
know what I'm saying 100% dude4 to $240
an hour is what they charge for these
that's like that's the piece that I'm
saying and then you're you're taking all
right if you are watching this clip
right now you are watching this on
YouTube and if you are a fan of podcast
please check out my podcast while you're
at it because sometimes I have podcasts
that aren't on YouTube and sometimes I
have YouTubes that aren't on podcast so
check out the ker office on any podcast
platform or you can go to TKO pod.com
also my newsletter will throw that in

[24:00]
also my newsletter will throw that in
there there are no ads It's weekly it's
different content than my podcast and
YouTube newsletter. chrisj cerner.com
You'll see the link and we'll see you
there that's why I like the box truck is
you're you're taking a a overhead
expense of rent out of your math it's
like it's like the benefit when you when
you own your home outright you don't
have a mortgage anymore changes your
entire cost of living equation right and
so I'm like okay cool like and to be
blunt you can also Finance a truck right
so like you're say you're paying $799
for whatever the truck is on finance
versus $1,500 a month for a physical
location which then has limitations it
only has so many people within a mile
radius versus it's the food truck model
like food trucks go where the people are
versus restaurants are stuck where they
are and I'm like barber shops podcast
Studios golf simulators you know game
trucks right like there's I feel like
there's the there's a laun list the dog
grooming is like probably one of the

[25:01]
grooming is like probably one of the
more popular examples of that right like
yep dog grooming will come to you the
guys they're out here running or roll up
to a dog park right in the parking lot
yeah you just can like pick up your
office and take it to where your
customers are and to me the benefit of
that is just like insane I used to have
iPhone repair shops and some days it was
slow and it was just like well we're
slow today that sucks I guess we're
going to do I've I bet our sales today
will be 150 bucks oh well maybe tomorrow
we'll do 500 but with this it's like all
right let's roll out we're going
somewhere else and then you you layer in
some fun stuff about Geo fenced ads and
like you know like you could go roll
into the Oracle office building and like
Geo Target specifically with Facebook
ads with an ad that says attention
Oracle employees we're sure yeah
whatever they're on if location San
Francisco if job title is Oracle right
we're here like come outside and get a

[26:02]
we're here like come outside and get a
haircut like six spots remaining you
know what I mean dude I got two more
ideas for you that are like in the same
genre we don't have to change the
subject right okay sick number one I'm
talking to a guy last week two I got two
ideas from this one guy lives here in
DFW does really well for himself he
wanted to buy a food truck as a passion
project not trying to make money not a
chef and it did well and but he he ran
into a big problem no place to park this
thing there's no place to park it right
storage facilities don't want it they
don't have have to put them they have to
be like at least in California has to
Beary yeah like there's like Comm yeah
yeah like they don't all have to stay
refrigerated 247 but his did right they
got to plug it in and you need
three-phase power and most like RV
facilities or sorry most self- storage
facilities that offer parking on the
sign don't have that and so what he did
and he was from Houston in Houston these
commissaries parking lots are all over

[27:00]
commissaries parking lots are all over
right okay for whatever reason I don't
know why Houston DFW similar sizes
they're all over and in DFW he lived in
fris which is like 40 minutes from
downtown Dallas and there's nothing in
Plano Frisco mckin Allen there's no
parking lots up there it's all suburbs
it's all you know crumbles and Chipotles
and Chick-fil-A right the 3 C's he was
having to drive from his house in Frisco
to downtown Dallas to this parking lot
just to get his thing to go out to a
cading catering order that was back in
Frisco right super inefficient yeah
inefficient guess what these commissary
parking lots charge per month per spot
and we're I'm talking literally like a
gravel lot with barbed wire fencing and
a plug I don't know like like a thousand
a thousand a month
850 for a parking spot are you kidding
me
right that's nuts and you want more
customers go find the food trucks right
like we know where food trucks are right

[28:00]
like we know where food trucks are right
we just go anytime there's a festival
you just go roll up be like where do you
guys Park this thing oh the moment they
like go roll their eyes you're like
that's a customer thank you there it is
there it is let me tell you about this
spot yep so that's one idea I got from
this guy second idea his business is
retrofitting cars with like LED lighting
underlighting I know nothing about this
industry because I've never done it he
was telling me about this Tesla Model s
that he retrofitted he you know they
have glass roofs he put like stars in
the roof some like the Rolls-Royce type
Vibe yes he put like LED lighting in in
the doors and like under the seats
everywhere three grand not nearly as
expensive as what I thought right right
and I asked him I was like let me guess
the guy Rents It Out On turo he's like
absolutely he does and I'm like okay
this is interesting so as we're talking
because I can't wait I'm on turo and I'm
looking and I'm just looking at the
pictures and I set a search six months
out for Tesla Model S and then I set a

[29:02]
out for Tesla Model S and then I set a
search for this weekend it's like six
months out you know 79 results available
this weekend seven results available
interesting let's do the same search
with Toyota Camry six months from now 80
results available this weekend 60
results available oh okay if I'm going
to put something on too it needs to be a
Tesla Model S now obviously you do more
research find more options there's
probably something even better than that
and then I start looking okay I looked
at Cyber trucks and it's like you've got
you know your plane Jane gray cyber
trucks and then you've got one WRA like
an American flag or WRA like a marble
countertop or green camo and sure enough
turo will show you how many days they're
rented out and you can do the math like
wow this thing makes n Grand a month
$230 a day and it's like huh the ones
that's wrapped in an American flag that
probably cost 3,500 bucks one time I can
charge charge $50 more a day at a 60%

[30:01]
charge charge $50 more a day at a 60%
occupancy rate huh that's $1,200 more
dollar a month that means I get my
$3,500 extra back in three months I
could have this thing on turo for 10
years huh right and it's just like I
love the idea
of a putting something interesting on
turo yeah right because he threw a Camry
on there it's just not going to work y
okay so let's I was looking at those I
was looking at those the Hummer the new
Hummers the the EV trucks similar I
because I yeah that's like that's on the
top of my list right now I really like
that car so I was like oh wonder what
they're like on turo and you're right
it's the same sort of math and then you
take it a step further and you're like
all right I'm going to get the most
unique thing that's already hot on turo
and then I'm going to make it theque
yeah yeah why not like would you rather
if if you want to go flex in a cyber
truck would you rather pay $180 a day
for a normal one or 230 a day for like a
cyberbeast that's just pimped out like
it's an extra $100 for two days why

[31:00]
it's an extra $100 for two days why
wouldn't you so I love that I love that
I mean the the guys that are on turo
definitely it was super popular a couple
years ago I had a buddy that had him and
his dad bought a fleet of Model S's in
Boston and they had I don't know they
probably had six of them the other
business that they had too that was
super dope was they rented out camper
conversion vans in California and so
they had like 4 yeah like 40 of not I
don't even know dude I think they were
like Chrysler Town and countries like
that were just retrofitted kind of like
you were saying where they just would
like load in the bed whatever their
their core setup is that's like
classified as a class brv like a van
that you can live in right yeah yeah
yeah yeah and they were just running it
up on they they did I want to say it was
Yos was like their main okay that they'd
do is they'd let people come in they'd
Park their car at their spot and take
the van up and like camp out for the
weekend and they I mean I want to say
they had 30 or 40 of those it was a
while ago so I'm not going to check my

[32:01]
while ago so I'm not going to check my
math but can I tell you what's brilliant
about that business specifically yeah is
all the marketplaces you can list on
right right let me list them out verbo
Airbnb RV share uh
outdoorsy and hip camp and then there's
like two or three more right it's just
you can list them on all of them and why
wouldn't you right you might as well
like if you have an Airbnb it goes on
Airbnb and verbo right and it's it's
stationary you can't just pick it up and
take it yeah yeah I mean you toss that
thing on turo like the whole yeah like
there's just more I don't know I love I
love mobile like I think that there's
something special there I want to go the
opposite direction to what we were
talking about before are you doing
anything with agents or repet or
anything like that cuz like I wish I had
more time to play with that yeah so I
went down the rabbit hole a little bit
to two days ago two nights ago I was
watching all the videos on youo how do

[33:01]
watching all the videos on youo how do
we create AI personal assistance how do
we like all of it similar thought train
to you is like I'm struggling to find
the time to get good enough at that to
like make it be meaningful and so that
that whole I don't know I probably spent
like two hours like trying to figure out
and and very specific use case like how
do I improve my own personal efficiency
was what I was trying to do like almost
almost how do I replicate an executive
assistant for myself right like can I
use AI to do that and after spending
about two hours on that I just posted a
job on onlinejobs.ph and was like dude
we're just gonna have to get a human in
here yeah to handle it you know and like
it just is I do I think there's massive
opportunity there yeah for sure I think
like the application of that technology
against specific use cases in specific
Industries or markets is massive like in
in an interesting way you know unlimited
content is a version of that right like

[34:00]
content is a version of that right like
we use a lot of AI and they've built our
own processes and and not agents
necessarily but like it's a it's a very
AI enabled offer and applying it to a
specific use case which is SEO to create
outsized returns it's basically just
Arbitrage for our clients and so I'm I'm
long on that model like am I proficient
enough at it individually at this point
to like go and spin up an offer around
that you know but like somebody should
well here's some interesting Frameworks
so I'm in your I'm in your Camp I not
built an agent yet but I've done enough
research to like kind of put a couple
Frameworks together on things that
people could build with agents right
right that are like it's not just like
Theory it's very possible for someone to
throw this together yeah number one did
I tell you about the thing I did with
creating my own subreddit I don't think
so I don't think I did so I already
talked about on previous episodes I
won't go too deep into it but you know I
was posting a Reddit and then as soon as
you put a link the moderators like ban
you on most of subreddits right it's

[35:00]
you on most of subreddits right it's
very hard so I thought I want my own
subreddit I want to be the moderator
okay yeah so I created a subreddit
called Biz ideas and then I went to
zapier and I built a zap that plugs into
open Ai and it so okay first let me back
up any social media platform is strict
about their API what can read what can
write it makes sense right they don't
want a bunch of bots in the replies on
Reddit spamming comments especially with
AI so there is a Reddit zap which is
very powerful but it will not write
comments to replies for that reason okay
but here's a framework use agents to
circumvent like API limitations right so
what I did on zapier which got me 90% of
the way there was anytime and this is
fully possible with zapier anytime you
see a new Post in any subreddit
worldwide that has the word idea in the
title not business idea but idea and
there's one like every 30 seconds I want

[36:00]
there's one like every 30 seconds I want
you to filter out any that are media
only because I can't watch a video I
don't know what what they're talking
about but if there's text there I want
you to read the text and then write a
comment not post a comment because it
won't let me but write a comment in my
Google sheet that is prefaced with any
good idea could be a business idea
here's how I'd monetize this and then I
told it to put in spelling mistakes I
told it to leave it you know no cap on
any of them so it looks more natural and
then at the very end of it there's a
line breaking it says TBH this is
probably a better fit for rbiz ideas
which is a hyperlink to my subreddit and
I'm just planting seeds all over the
internet as I sleep yeah and it's worked
it's worked but I can't post the comment
I got to do that manually okay now it
will post the link to the post and so I
literally I can go into chat GPT it
automatically or I can go into my Google
sheet it automatically adds the row
click the r link click the sell with the
comment copy open the link paste you can

[37:02]
comment copy open the link paste you can
do it in two seconds but you got to do
it why not build an agent that can get
you the last 10% why not that's possible
with agents I was like why not that's it
yeah I haven't spent enough time to be
like hey this is what's good that would
work but it sounds like a no-brainer
like it sounds like a perfect use case
for it why aren't people creating or
building their own subreddits and even
using Reddit ads to drive people to it
and then owning that audience more I
think that that that's its own like
thread that we could dive into like
that's smart right it's it's similar to
owning Facebook pages or or third party
Niche Publications like we do with with
blogs and stuff or Instagram accounts
that are theme or Niche oriented that
push to a specific offer and so yeah I
think that that's its own its own model
I think the other half of it is like
that is an
opportunity for somebody to go and build
the bot offer and sell it to you right

[38:01]
the bot offer and sell it to you right
like when I hear that bu agent oh genius
there it is yeah build a redit agent and
resell that for a monthly fee yeah and
that's that to me is where when I was
diving into more of the agent stuff you
know and there's there's guys that do it
right like I think there's a bunch that
do like Ai
call like like they'll pick up or do the
first outbound almost like a Setter
right replacing the setter that are AI
that sell the real State agents or or
stuff like that and I think there's a
bunch of use cases like that what is
interesting to me and I think a a macro
Trend or a macro belief that I have is
that the people that are capable of
building those things are not always the
ones that are capable of selling or like
understanding the actual application of
it think about like when I got on
Twitter I don't know three four five
years ago you know the Indie hacker
crowd right right people that were you
know I was I was in the vein of the guys

[39:00]
know I was I was in the vein of the guys
that were discovering no code or like
micro sass or like any of those and what
I realized was like these guys were
really good at building functional
software that like could do things but
none of them understood how to create
anything unique that like actually
solved a product pain point or the ones
that do get VC funded and become you
know Dropbox yeah and so it's like yeah
literally about everyone else and so
it's like
and and the challenge with those and
I've tried is like a lot of those guys
you know they they're entrepreneurial in
their brain right and so they want to
like own their own thing and it's like
yeah dude the world the world just
doesn't need another another job board
that makes 2400 bucks a month dude it's
like you can use your talent another
resume improver yeah like you know what
I mean it's like it it feels like
everybody goes and builds the same
product over and over and over and over
over again and I think it's just their
approach and it's like versus you know I

[40:01]
approach and it's like versus you know I
would hope that like somebody that
understands how to code and write and
use replit or right listens to this and
goes oh shoot there's like there's an
actual tangible business application
here that I can go and pursue and I'm
like yeah that that side of it is like
if you're listening to this and you're a
developer and you want to make more
money please DM us because we have the
ideas we just need people to execute on
building the software for the use cases
let me give my Mr be
thumbnail it's interesting I've been
I've been sending DMS and stuff to
people on on Twitter another vein for us
to dive down is I I really have this
interesting thought around you know some
of the some of the iOS applications
We've ran marketing for iOS applications
and cost per download is low and I think
High referral is there like there's
stuff there's there's mechanisms in the
iOS world that I like I've been hitting

[41:00]
iOS world that I like I've been hitting
up these guys that are all like I don't
know the Indie hackers that build iOS
apps on on these things and it's like
either they're working in ninet to-5 and
have side projects and don't want to
take on third party consulting or like
development gigs or they want to be
partners in this stuff and I'm like dude
like I'll literally send you $10,000
right now if you can just build me this
thing and they're
like I don't know I'm like dude like
let's go it's an interesting where I
think there's there's a couple guys that
I know that are on Twitter that have
kind of built a business around that
which is we'll build your MVP in 30 days
or less for five to 10 grand and I think
that that's an interesting one I think
there's like there's more surrounding
that that I think is interesting for
these developers like but I think a lot
of them want to own their own app and
that's fine but like you can make I mean
I got boys that do Dev shops you know
that clear $3 million a year it's
interesting because like the world I
don't know if the world needs another

[42:00]
don't know if the world needs another
like Resume Builder chat GPT rapper but
the world could could take on one more
like the market is plenty big enough for
a hundred more you know chat GPT rappers
that just help you build or optimize
your resum but the distribution isn't
there the distribution is the hard part
the distribution and the product
positioning I talk about it a lot I used
to tweet it constantly and it was like
people always talk about like product
Market fit as the thing and I'm like M I
don't think it's product Market fit
necessarily I think it's it's it's like
Market positioning fit right like
positioning the offer well in the market
like that that piece like that sums it
up it's like you can use the same tool
it's just like how do you position it
for a specific Market that you have a
distribution advantage in because if you
can crack that side of it you can sell
anything or pricing so like not just the
right price but the right way to frame

[43:00]
right price but the right way to frame
the price so there is this Outdoor Shop
a retail chain in uh the UK I don't
remember what they're called outdoor
something but think Costco but different
they have an interesting model where you
need you walk in and you see two prices
for everything and this is an exact
example that I saw there was a tent for
250b if you're a non-member or 70 lb if
you're a member huge huge price
difference right it makes no sense to
not become a member now what does it
cost to be a member well it cost goes
150 200 bucks a year at this place $5 a
year a year right and so it's like the
way to look at that on the surface is
like oh it's genius because they get
recurring revenue and they can still
make a profit at $70 cool but go a
little deeper why else is it genius it's
because it's kind of like the Planet
Fitness model like now that you're a
member you you're anchored to that price
now you're like well gez now I now I got
to buy everything here because I'm a

[44:01]
to buy everything here because I'm a
member right right I got to buy this
tent because look at the price
difference I'm a member I got I got to
move all my shopping it's forget Planet
Fitness it's closer to like a like a gas
station rewards card right you know it's
like I'm gonna go to RAC I'm to go there
I'm gonna get my 10 cents you know what
I mean yeah there's a your 10 cents that
was so good steeper discount yeah I mean
it's a no-brainer it's like I think that
there's it go it honestly plays more
into the retention side of the business
right like when you are it's similar
with clothing like I've signed up for
those with brands that I love and it's
like yeah dude I'm not going to go buy a
shirt elsewhere because like I get my
20% off I already have enough Affinity
towards the specific brand to become a
member in the first place right like oh
like racetrack like there's a racetrack
and there's an Arco I don't know if
there's Arco in Texas I don't remember
but you know they're both on my way to
work but I've been going to the
racetrack and now I am a member there so

[45:01]
racetrack and now I am a member there so
now I just go there right it's a
retention play even if Arco is six cents
cheaper you're like well I'm a member
I'll get my 10 cents off or I'll get my
rewards program or whatever that is and
so I think that that's super smart
there's a there's an Ecom brand called
public goods that does something similar
like when you said Costco I was like oh
public goods where it's all like very
clean minimalistic brand
like I'm going to call it Essentials
like soaps and you know they have
seasonings like kind of just like
household normal goods and I think you
pay like 99 bucks a year to do it there
and a lot of like airbnbs and stuff are
members there and they just get all of
the that stuff but like that similar
model of like now if I'm going to go buy
soap well I'm already paying 99 bucks a
year over here I might as well just get
it from them because I'll save my 177%
there's more opportunity for stuff like
that in the market in general enal kind
of in line with even what we're saying
with the home service maintenance plan

[46:00]
with the home service maintenance plan
it's like I'm oh I pay 99 bucks a year
for you know plumbing company A's
maintenance plan like I'm just going to
call them when I have an issue I'm not
going to go look on Google and say hey
plumbing shop near me right no you're
already in like you just guarantee not
guarantee but like you incentivize
retention and loyalty
