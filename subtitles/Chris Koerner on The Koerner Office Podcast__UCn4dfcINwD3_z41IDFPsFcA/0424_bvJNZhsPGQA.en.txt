look at this freaking thing right here
now before I tell you what this is
here's how and why you should make a ton
of money selling products or services to
introverts like me theold your judgment
I'm an introvert but I don't drink
coffee but I also don't think this is a
dumb idea and here's why look at this
Google Trends data right here showing
worldwide searches for things for
introverts this is a thing this is a
growing category labels May disable but
people also label themselves as an
introvert or an extrovert and they will
buy products or services around that
label look at this viral tweet jobs for
introvert millions of views X Y or Z for
introverts or for extroverts is a thing
so yeah you can make fun of people for
buying coffee from a hole in the wall
because they don't want to talk to
someone that's judgment you do you but
I'm going to look at this
opportunistically what product or
service can I build around the introvert
or the extrovert label and the thing is
whatever you're offering doesn't need to
be special or unique or anything you
just need to frame it and Market it
towards introverts and extroverts and
shine a light on that label full
business plan right here
