[00:00]
welcome to the ker office it's Wednesday
and you know what that means that means
it's time for some Q&A it's been about 3
weeks since I've done it but I have a
backlog of questions right now and I've
curated some pretty good ones so if you
ever want to ask me a question on this
show go to TKO pod.com scroll to the
very bottom and you'll see a widget
where you can record your voice you can
make it Anonymous or not you can leave
your email or not and I will play your
question and answer it most likely
we're going to go ahead and play this
question from Dustin what's up Chris my
name is Dustin my wife and I we love
listening to your content man we've been
entrepreneurs for four years we had a
flash in the pan success when we first
started did about a half a million
dollars and then our business model just
completely vanished almost overnight and
I've tried tons of different business
models digital marketing AI e-commerce
all kinds of things and uh have not been
able to get anything to work for over
two years now and so it's gotten to the

[01:00]
two years now and so it's gotten to the
point where we've spent all our money
spent endless amounts of time on it so
many business models have failed and I'd
always you know believed the gurus like
you know everything works you just have
to work it and you only lose if you quit
well now we're filing for bankruptcy my
wife left me for a while it's been
really bad I just had to take a 9-5 job
just to put food on the table so man I
wanted to know if you have any advice
for someone like me who like I believe
in the entrepreneurial dream I want want
to have that you know time freedom and
creativity and flexibility and all that
stuff but I'm just in this position
where I feel kind of broken you know
like what do I do how do you recover
from that and and how do you keep going
and any advice you have would be super
appreciated thanks man Dustin I'm sorry
to hear about your rough go of it here
over the last couple years I don't get a
lot of segments like this but this stuff
happens more often than most people are
willing to admit so thank you for being
willing to talk about this I don't know
a lot I don't the industries you were in

[02:01]
a lot I don't the industries you were in
I don't know what customer acquisition
channels you tried so my info and
knowledge is limited here but I'll do
what I can so the first thought that
came to me as I listened to your
question is have you considered buying a
business buying a business is a great
way to skip the line to profitability
assuming you already have the skills to
run a business you're confident to run a
business you already have the skills I
don't recommend anyone buy a business
right off the bat that is a recipe for a
nightmare and I don't know what your W2
is are you managing people what are your
responsibilities like I have no idea so
I'm going to lead with the assumption
that you're good at managing people you
know how to do it you know how to run a
business you built the business to half
a million dollars it failed for whatever
reason I don't know how much cash you
have but I do know that there are a lot
more businesses for sale than there are
buyers or should I say there are a lot
more businesses that should be for sale
because they're about to fail than there
are buyers if you go look at bisb
sale.com you're looking at maybe 2% of
all the businesses out there that could

[03:01]
all the businesses out there that could
be for sale if someone were to cold
contact them and offer to buy their
business I recently read an article
about a guy that joined his local
Facebook group and just posted he just
said I'm looking for a business to buy I
don't care what the industry is this is
about the size of business I'm looking
for from a revenue perspective this is
who I am here's a picture of my family
here's my background would love to talk
that led to about a dozen leads and he
ended up buying an awesome business that
was mostly seller financed and you're
going to have the easiest time doing
that in your own home local market so I
don't know if you've considered that or
not but entrepreneurship and
Entrepreneurship through acquisition ETA
are one in the same and you're right a
lot of gur out there you know just keep
going just keep trying just keep
grinding it'll work and sometimes it
doesn't and they say that businesses
never fail Founders just run out of
energy and I totally feel that there's
been many times where I've just run out
of energy very deliberately I've just
said to myself I'm done done I'm done

[04:00]
said to myself I'm done done I'm done
with this this isn't worth it anymore
opportunity cost is a very real thing so
I encourage you to consider buying a
business you don't have to spend a lot
of money if you have people in your life
that love know and trust you that might
have a little disposable income you
could raise some capital from them for a
down payment sell or Finance the rest
buy a sweaty startup ugly bluecolor
business that needs some technology
added to it and see if you can at least
earn what you're making in your W2 right
now aside from that man you just got to
wait it out just keep working your W2
and just keep testing things on the
nights and weekends that sounds generic
but it just works you just got to keep
trying things I would spend an hour a
day playing with AI repet perplexity
chat GPT anything that is the most
asymmetric bet you could take on
yourself right now so that's my advice
three different things consider buying a
business by asking around in your local
area learn AI as much as you can and
just keep trying things in the nights
and weekends while you have your W2 but
don't give up all right let's go to
Demetrius next I I know you hear this

[05:00]
Demetrius next I I know you hear this
all the time but I'm exactly like you I
have a million ideas and everybody makes
fun of me for it but sometimes I don't
know what to do with them you or how to
make money from them really is my main
issue I have a newborn son that was just
born and I have this great idea in my
head so right now I kind of do a tree
delivery service and my idea was to make
it like uber for trees right now I'm
actually going on upward fiber trying to
find somebody that can create something
for me that can where I could deliver
the trees and make it like a uber for
tree delivery but my issue is how do I
make enough money to still survive and
be a for my family a top of putting
money into this idea and have tons and
tons of ideas notebooks of ideas that I
don't I can't really do because I don't
know how I'm going to make money from
the idea so my question is how do you
know if an idea can make money where do

[06:01]
know if an idea can make money where do
you find ways to make the money from the
idea but thank you so much for your time
um I love your content I love your
emails I read every single one of them
because they're definitely motivating
that I know that I'm not alone with all
these ideas and all these creative
thoughts so I'm trying to figure out
Demetrius love your question let's zoom
out before we zoom in here so you've got
lots of ideas notebook's full of ideas
people give you a hard time yada y y so
I'm thinking back on my life life and my
experience and I don't remember people
give me a hard time all that much for my
ideas and maybe that's because I'm
self-conscious about them and I don't
share them as much as maybe I should or
maybe that's because a lot of times my
ideas turn into something on paper or on
the Internet before I even have a chance
to tell anyone but my wife so the only
thing I know about you is this 90
seconds I just heard but I think if you
were to convert some of that time you
spend writing down your ideas into a
notebook into time spent learning how to

[07:00]
notebook into time spent learning how to
validate these ideas before having to
launch them using widely available tools
Facebook ad library card
CD Facebook ads landing pages
marketplaces Facebook Marketplace Etsy
Facebook groups using these tools to
validate the idea and I when I say
validate I mean like see if you can
actually get paying customers not see if
you can get people to tell you it's a
good idea it seems like you've fallen
into a trap of ideating and you love the
idea of these ideas but you don't yet
know if you love launching these ideas
yet you have to love launching the thing
and if you're truly in love with an idea
then you will find whatever it takes to
get that idea off the notebook and onto
the internet to convert that idea into
dollars and cents into your bank account
if you think telling people your idea is
becoming a hindrance to you because
they're giving you a hard time even if
in good fun don't not tell people your
idea because you're afraid they'll steal
it but if their negativity is doing more
harm than good then keep it to yourself
convert that idea into Act into energy

[08:00]
convert that idea into Act into energy
now as for the the Uber for tree
delivery idea if you're already doing
tree delivery and it's working and I
assume it's profitable if I were you I
would spend more time on trying to copy
and paste what has already worked to
acquire the customers that you already
have can Uber for tree delivery be a
thing yes Uber for anything could be a
thing because really what we're saying
is just if we're Uber ifying something
then it just means we're making it more
convenient and there's always a business
to be had for making any product or
service Market convenient so I'm sure
there's a business there but you're
getting ahead of yourself to me this is
just like another idea you're adding a
second idea onto the idea that you're
already working on that is already
making you money I don't know if you can
afford to have shiny objects in them
right now go to your piece of paper
write down all of your customers write
alongside them write down how you
acquired all of them and then right
alongside those generate dozens of ideas
of how you can do more of that I don't
know are you going through the tree
supplier are they giving you jobs to
deliver to their customers or are you

[09:01]
deliver to their customers or are you
going through end customers and grabbing
trees from the suppliers I don't know
but I would certainly try to find more
customers first if you're an idea guy
that's a strength okay but take that
muscle in your brain take that skill
that you have and use it to generate
customer acquisition ideas within the
one idea that you're already working on
instead of using that muscle to think of
entirely new ideas alog together all
right we're going to go to Anonymous
next hello Chris I'm a big fan of the
podcast and the newsletter thank you for
sharing all this superb content I work
in finance as a salesperson for seven
years at the same firm since November
I've been writing a newsletter email
focused on Global Market which goes out
to over 30,000 institutional clients I
didn't grow this organically I simply
added all the firm's clients but since
then I've received really really
positive feedback many many emails from
clients telling me they love it internal
folks told me clients have told them

[10:02]
folks told me clients have told them
that they love the product never seen
such positive feedback since I've been
working in finance so I've been thinking
about essentially launching a substack
or doing this newsletter on my own the
math works pretty quickly if I get a
th000 subscriber at uh 30 bucks a month
I'm making $30,000 a month which would
be great the issue is I have a
non-compete at my firm so I can't just
start this on the side while working
there so that's the Crux of the issue I
can't just email the entire list and say
I'm starting a substack because the firm
would probably sue me so I love your
thoughts on this man I don't know what
to do with this let's start okay let me
back up I love newsletters I love
Financial newsletters I am I literally
spent five hours today in my newsletter
tweaking Facebook ads getting my cost
per acquisition down looking at metrics
I love newsletter I love the newsletter

[11:00]
I love newsletter I love the newsletter
business so you are on the right track
let's start there we're on the same page
so video is cool but you know what's
better long form audio via podcast and
my newsletter TKO pod.com go there to
subscribe for free to my newsletter it's
one email a week very tactical 1500
words per email and then go to my audio
podcast three episodes a week stuff like
this you're going to love it all free no
sleazy sales TKO pod.com there are
two aspects to any newsletter business
the Fulfillment and the customer
acquisition and really you could kind of
boil down any business to that but
especially in the newsletter it's very
very straightforward which I love I love
binary businesses right I talk about
this all the time I love simple
businesses okay so you have half of the
equation down pat already the
Fulfillment you're already writing it
and it's amazing you have an amazing
product your customers love it check
awesome you don't yet know about
customer acquisition but you could
probably figure that out but man what am
I supposed to do here you told me that
you you're under non-compete so I don't
know if that means you're not going to
try to pull subscribers away from your

[12:01]
try to pull subscribers away from your
boss which is great or if that means you
don't know what to do I'm going to lead
with the assumption that you're not
going to try to steal customers away
from your current job but you are
seriously considering starting this
entirely new fresh and that you won't
get in trouble with your non-compete
because you're not going to steal
customers you're going to find your own
customers and maybe in a different
Financial Niche than whatever you're
doing right now so let's lead with that
assumption okay so you've got the
writing part down we won't even talk
about that you need to find customers
okay here's why I love the newsletter
business anyone listening to this you
should probably start a newsletter
business and no I have no newsletter
courses to sell you here's why I love it
okay let me back up I'm all over the
place my ad are all is worn off I guess
why do people love e-commerce Brands
we're starting an Ecommerce business
because they can be money machines you
put a dollar into the ad machine and it
gives you three to $5 back okay direct
to Consumer business you start a Shopify
store you get some fancy pictures and

[13:00]
store you get some fancy pictures and
videos taken you put some ad creative up
you ABCD test everything on meta ad
manager you test it across Instagram and
Facebook until finally you realize okay
we're selling a $75 widget and we're
spending $8 on average to acquire a
customer our gross margins are 70% our F
cost of aill is $10 and so at the end of
the day after paying all of our overhead
we are putting in $1 and getting back 12
now that's that'd be pretty extreme so
let's say we're putting in $1 to get
back seven and then when you get Word of
Mouth involved and then you get three
order rate involved that putting in $1
to get seven could turn into 17 right
that's what that's how Brands like all
birds Casper figs pelaton purple
mattresses athletic Greens on and on and
on all of these e-commerce Brands as
sexy and complex as they look on the
surface it's really just Facebook ads
and Shopify that's that's the secret you

[14:00]
and Shopify that's that's the secret you
got to have a good product but even that
you can make up for with good ad copy
and creative and design so if you could
take a good product like athletic greens
or something an amazing creative and
good fulfillment good customer service
you can build a billion dollar brand on
Shopify billion with a B on a Shopify
site that cost $29 a month to start
that's why people love the e-commerce
business and that's probably a business
I know better than anything else but
that's a freaking hard business cuz
fulfilling the product is really really
really hard growth is really hard I
talked about this a week or two ago on
my how to build a $10 million business
episode about LCD cycle if you grow 20%
a month and you have a 20% margin then
you're never cash flow positive
profitable yes cash flow positive no
e-commerce businesses are freaking hard
despite the fact that they look really
binary on the surface very
straightforward and simple on the
surface like I love they are hard
businesses okay take the good things
about an e-commerce business remove the
bad bad things and you've got a

[15:00]
bad bad things and you've got a
newsletter business it's binary it's
straightforward but you don't need a
warehouse you don't need a third party
Logistics partner you don't need to file
disputes with UPS you don't have
products going bad products getting lost
products getting broken you don't have
people getting mad no one gets mad in
the newsletter business and you can
drive all of it with paid ads it is a
beautiful beautiful thing so this is
very recent on my brain so this segment
will be longer than average because I'm
excited and if I'm talking about
something in an excited way then you get
excited so it's a win-win all around oh
you guys are going to love this okay so
there's a magical word called co-
co-registration okay and what that means
is I can drive traffic to my newsletter
signup page after I get a subscriber a
popup will appear saying hey you like
the ker office newsletter do you also
like XY or Z newsletter the boxes will
automatically be checked and they can
click subscribe to all five of them
three to five of them they can uncheck
the boxes they can close the popup but

[16:02]
the boxes they can close the popup but
it is a beautiful way to get three to
five more subscribers for partner
newsletters after you've already secured
the bag for yourself okay
co-registration is kind of like an
infinite money glitch with some caveats
which I will explain in great detail so
partner newsletters will pay you between
$1 and $10 per subscriber so let's say
you have five partner newsletters each
willing to pay you $3 per subscriber
that's $15 let's say if you spend $2 on
Facebook ads to acquire a customer that
$2 customer is worth $6 to you because
you know they're going to stick around
for 12 months you know what your CPM
your cost per Mill is to advertise to
them so you're getting a 3X row as
return on ad spend you're turning $2
into six with Facebook ads you with me
so far into the money machine just like
we talked about with Shopify stores okay
so you triple your money but then with
coed co-registration let's just say in a
perfect word world that person says I am

[17:01]
perfect word world that person says I am
hungry right now I'm eager to learn I'm
going to learn from Chris kerer on the
ker office but I also want to learn
about stock tips I want to learn about
better copyrighting I want to learn how
to sell things on Amazon oh and look
Chris is recommending five newsletters
and with one click I can subscribe to
all of them and 2025 can be my year of
learning let's do this okay so now
assuming here's one of the caveats
assuming that that subscriber opens and
clicks over the next 2 to three weeks as
many times as that newsletter partner
requires assuming that happens which
that's a big assumption assuming the
subscriber does those requisite things
for all five Partners you will make $3
time five newsletter Partners equals
$155 for that one subscriber that's
worth $6 to you so we're talking six
plus 15 so you're getting $21 for the $2
that you spent on Facebook ads so you're
turning $2 into $21
10x return on ad spend okay now that

[18:03]
10x return on ad spend okay now that
almost never happens that almost never
happens here's what's going to happen
they're probably going to opt into 1.92
of those five that's what my average is
1.92 and of those 1.92 they may never
click on either of those newsletter
Partners they may never open either of
them but realistically you can expect to
make between 50 cents and $150 extra for
that newsletter subscriber so let's just
say it's a dollar if you spend $2 to a
ire them then your cost per acquisition
your CPA gets cut in half so now instead
of a 3X row as return on ad spend from 2
to 6 you have a 6X Ras because your
effective cost per acquisition is only
$1 instead of two because it was offset
by referring that email out to the
partner newsletters you double your
return on investment okay and guess what
the newsletter business was an amazing
business before cored ever existed and
it's been around for about 2 3 four
years now I just started doing this in

[19:00]
years now I just started doing this in
Earnest a couple months ago and I
revamped my strategy a week ago and this
is a six-figure line of profit for me
not Revenue but profit and you know
passive income doesn't exist but this is
pretty dang close now here are the other
caveats number one there is a theory and
I will know with more testing but so far
it's not true for me there is a theory
that if you share your email with three
to five other newsletters they will be
less likely to open or click on yours
because they're they're going to split
their attention four to five other ways
but you could argue they're most loyal
to you because you're the reason they
joined in the first place and those
other guys were an afterthought that's
one caveat is if you're on the revenue
generation side of this Marketplace your
subscribers might be less loyal less
likely to open less likely to click more
likely to unsubscribe if you're on the
other side of this Marketplace and
you're giving money to partner
newsletters to grow your newsletter then
it almost certainly means that those
subscribers you acquire from partner

[20:00]
subscribers you acquire from partner
newsletters are not going to be as loyal
because they had lower intent they
didn't click on your Facebook ad they
clicked on Chris kerner's Facebook ad
the only thing they know about you is
the one sentence they read right before
they click the green button and they
might not have even read it they might
not even know who you are when they see
your welcome email so I prefer
co-registration on the revenue side of
it because my theory and so far as it's
backed by data is that they're going to
be loyal to me but not very loyal to the
partners that I sell the email to but I
will soon be testing the other side of
this and paying Partners $1 to $3 for
their emails and I will be measuring
them very very closely and you only pay
that's the good part is if you're on the
cost center side of this if you're
paying for partner subscribers you only
pay if the subscriber does X Y or Z
before a certain date and if they don't
then you get to keep that subscriber for
free okay so I can say they need to
click on two emails in the first three
weeks or I'm not paying form and that
person will not get paid for 3 weeks and

[21:01]
person will not get paid for 3 weeks and
they only will get paid if they clicked
it twice and did not unsubscribe over
that time frame now on day 22 if they
unsubscribe then I'm out money anyway so
coed alone makes the newsletter business
a great business but it's just like the
e-commerce business in that you just
have to dial in your ads and here's
exactly what you're going to do you're
going to take a 5 to 15sec video of your
call to action some sort of a lead
magnet you're in finance so maybe stock
picks I don't know what you're doing and
you're going to take five to 10 of those
five to 15c videos you're going to have
five descriptions five headlines and
five body text and you're going to ABC
test all 15 of those different pieces of
text plus the five to 10 different
pieces of creative maybe some pictures
maybe some screenshots of your Apple
notes app those work really well maybe
some videos and then you're going to
push all that into the meta algorithm
and you're going to say use Advantage
Plus audience in other words I'm not
going to tell you who to show this to or

[22:00]
going to tell you who to show this to or
where to show it I trust your algorithm
you're A2 trillion doll company do your
thing and then you're going to watch
what your CPA is your cost per
acquisition it's going to start high
five six seven8 doll and then it's going
to come down over time as the algorithm
learns and then on the newsletter side
of it in your platform you're going to
measure very closely how much they
opening or clicking my open rates are
about 55% very consistently I keep my
list clean I delete people if they're
not opening enough and my clickthrough
rates are four to 7% depending on the
email and that stays pretty consistent
as well and I've added 30,000
subscribers this month it's been my best
month ever and I'm having a lot of fun
so I didn't plan for this to be
primarily about newsletters but I get
really fired up about this newsletters
are amazing okay newsletters are amazing
and I will say I'm using spark Loop for
my co-registration highly recommended
and I use beehive for my newsletter
platform and I've used a zillion
newsletter Platforms in the past all of

[23:01]
newsletter Platforms in the past all of
them and beehive is the best and yes I
do have an affiliate link for both spark
Loop and beehive that hopefully Muhammad
do not publish this episode until you
put those in the description because you
will get a discount if you use them and
I will get a little Kickback and I
genuinely use and love them so how about
that it's a win-win never tried substack
never used convert kit but I've
basically used most of the others and
beehive is the
bomb so long story short to the caller I
highly recommend you start a newsletter
you have the Fulfillment figured out
honestly that's the hardest part because
Facebook can do the other hard part for
you the customer acquisition and the
financial Niche is pretty much the most
profitable newsletter Niche you could be
in I don't have any paid newsletter so
you're talking about a th000 to $30 a
month I've never tried to convert my
free newsletter to paid I don't know
what that could look like I definitely
recommend you starting with free and
then trying to convert 1 to 2% of those
to paid over time once they learn to
love and trust you all right that's it
for today we'll do more Q&A here soon on

[24:00]
for today we'll do more Q&A here soon on
the Kerner office please share with a
friend love you guys see you next time
