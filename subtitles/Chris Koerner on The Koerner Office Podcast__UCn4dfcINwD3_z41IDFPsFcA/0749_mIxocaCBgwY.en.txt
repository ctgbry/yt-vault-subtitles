And this is probably the most underused
advertising in all advertising. And it
can be the most profitable if you do it
right. A lot of these local businesses,
they're not marketers. They're experts
and pros at what they do at HVAC or
roofing or cleaning. They don't know the
Google platform. So if you know these
things, that gives you the edge over 90%
of your competitors. Like you're sitting
on a gold mine here and it wouldn't take
that much. You literally have softwares
that do it for you. It's so easy. And
he's like, "Mark, can you pause ads?"
I'm like, "What? What do you mean pause
ads? Can you stop printing money,
please?" If your website can answer
those three things in the first 3 to 5
seconds, you have a good website. And it
doesn't take a lot of effort.
So, when I was a dumb teenager growing
up in Tattisville, Florida, I had a good
friend named Marcus. Marcus and I would
hang out, do dumb stuff together, and
then he moved to Australia and we lost
touch. But as luck would have it, I got
reconnected with Marcus again this year
and I learned he is a Google ads and
YouTube ads absolute savant. So we break

[01:02]
YouTube ads absolute savant. So we break
down what types of businesses and what
types of offers just crush on both
Google and or YouTube ads. How to make
your landing page convert for YouTube
and Google ads to the highest possible
extent. And what types of business ideas
or agencies can you launch with a little
bit of Google and YouTube ad knowledge?
Also, if you already own a business, how
can you explode the growth of your
business with Google or YouTube ads?
You're going to love it. Please enjoy.
This might not be a good question
because it I know the answer is often it
depends. What niches are you seeing just
particularly work well for Google ads?
Because anecdotally with all these
businesses I've played with, sometimes
Facebook ads crush, sometimes Google ads
crash, sometimes they both crush.
&gt;&gt; Sometimes like, you know, an ad for like
an ambulance chasing lawyer just crushes
in Abalene, Texas. But two hours down
the road in Midland, Texas, it doesn't
because there's so many other
sophisticated lawyers bidding on the
same keyword. So, it's very much an it
depends question. I know that roofing is
very saturated. They're more

[02:00]
very saturated. They're more
sophisticated because it's a higher
ticket price. It's very competitive,
yada yada yada. In general, what have
you seen? Like, if someone were to start
from scratch and say, I want to launch a
business that wholly relies on YouTube
and Google ads. I want to have the
greatest chance of success. What niches
should I even consider starting? So, you
want to have a a business where your the
lifetime value of a client is in the
thousands. So, it could be a cleaning
business. It could be roofing. It could
be pressure spraying, could be window
clean,
&gt;&gt; pressure washing. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Could be gutter cleaning, right? It
could be car detailing. Any type of home
service business where your client, the
lifetime value of a client is in the
thousands is a great way to go because
the more your client is worth, the
easier it is to advertise. Like if your
client's worth like 50 bucks or 100
bucks like once off, that's it. It's

[03:00]
bucks like once off, that's it. It's
going to be tough.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So it's got to either be recurring
or high ticket.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. High ticket
&gt;&gt; 100%. So, like I mean right now I'm
helping some clean businesses, roof
business, a med spa. I even have an
affiliate marketer that's spending
$80,000 a month on Google ads. Not even
joking.
&gt;&gt; What type of an offer is he an affiliate
for?
&gt;&gt; A SAS a SAS offer.
&gt;&gt; I bet I know what it is.
&gt;&gt; I think you do.
&gt;&gt; I bet I do.
&gt;&gt; That's a SAS offer. So,
&gt;&gt; I need to make a call.
See, that's very interesting because
people think people go want to launch a
SAS business when they don't realize
they could be an affiliate for another
SAS business, not have to do any of the
work, but basically still have their own
SAS business.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Does that make sense?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But that's he's like a very
special case. So, yeah. Yeah. So
basically any sort of local service
business that has a high lifetime value

[04:01]
business that has a high lifetime value
client, Google ads will work for them.
&gt;&gt; Have you ever taken on a client and you
thought it would work, it checked all
the boxes and it just didn't work? You
probably had clients that gave up too
soon.
&gt;&gt; That Yeah, that's it.
&gt;&gt; But other than that,
&gt;&gt; so okay, perfect example. I had a client
who did hypnosis, right? Hypnosis
therapy. She would help people who with
smoking and vaping. Her keyword price
bid prices were just like so sweet, so
low. Like it was so good. I was like,
"This is going to be awesome. There's so
much goodness here." And like so like we
developed her landing page and
everything, started running ads and it
started to work, right? But she had she
had a couple bad experiences. It would
go a really long way if you just
subscribed to this channel. It's just a
good way of saying Chris, thanks for the
value.
&gt;&gt; She had one good experience, but then
she had two bad experiences at at the
end of like people signing up for a call
because they get like a complimentary,

[05:01]
because they get like a complimentary,
you know, 30 minute evaluation or
whatever she called it.
&gt;&gt; Discovery call. Yeah. And she's like,
"This isn't working. I want to stop."
&gt;&gt; Cuz she wasn't closing them.
&gt;&gt; Well, she wasn't closing them.
&gt;&gt; She wasn't a closer.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And I think one of them didn't
show up or whatever. and
&gt;&gt; which will happen like that's why show
rate is a thing that you
&gt;&gt; measure and that's that's where I that's
where I said look what's your follow-up
sequence do you have emails going out
reminder emails going out do you have
text messages do you have text messages
going out to them what is your follow-up
sequence oh I just have one email that
goes out that's goes out like just like
two days before the day before like no
like your email is probably going to
spam to the update box in Google.
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; you need to have a better follow-up
date. I mean I mean a better follow-up
sequence. I started spitting all these
facts to her. She was like, "No, it's
too difficult." I'm like, "You're
sitting on a gold mine here, you know,

[06:01]
sitting on a gold mine here, you know,
and you're not willing to put the effort
into, you know, getting to it." And it
wouldn't take that much. And like you
literally have softwares that do it for
you.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So easy. before you take on a client,
before you launch a campaign, what type
of research do you do and what tools do
you use to say, "All right, yeah,
there's there's something here," right?
Because on one hand, it's like you can
sell anything with Google Ads. And on
the other hand, it's like, "Yeah, but
some things work a lot better than
others." And if I'm taking on a client
that does, you know, HVAC in Plano,
Texas, I really want to make sure that
there's not 800 other HVAC companies in
Plano bidding on the same keywords
because it might not work for him. he
might want to think about Facebook or or
something else in that market. Right.
&gt;&gt; So, the first thing to look at is can I
even advertise like am I even allowed to
advertise that on Google? As far as when
you mentioned like HVAC, yeah, there
could be a bunch of other competitors,
right? But what I do is I look at okay,

[07:00]
right? But what I do is I look at okay,
where are those competitors sending
their traffic? What does their website
look like? like a typical website that's
not optimized for conversion or is it a
a website that is clean and if I go to
their website I can I can know how they
can help me how I can contact them do
they have like case studies testimonials
within 3 seconds
&gt;&gt; in other words even if some somewhere is
crowded like more crowding equals a
higher likelihood that people are just
doing things wrong where you can have an
edge
&gt;&gt; yes and that's what you look for you're
looking for edge. And literally the
biggest edge you can have is where you
send your traffic. A lot of these local
businesses, if they're running their own
marketing, which a lot of them do,
they're not marketers. They're experts
and pros at what they do, like at HVAC
or roofing or cleaning or pressure
spraying or pest or pest spraying or car
detailing, whatever.
&gt;&gt; That's where they're pros at. They don't

[08:00]
&gt;&gt; That's where they're pros at. They don't
know the Google platform. They don't
know. They don't even know what what
what their conversion rate is or what
the LTV is, the lifetime value is of one
of their clients. If you know these
things and you're willing to put in the
effort and it doesn't take a lot of
effort to like optimize your website,
that gives you the edge over 90% of your
competitors.
&gt;&gt; What are like some outliers that you've
seen in the right direction where it's
like, yeah, you know, this will work.
I've done my research and you know, we
could expect to re receive $4 back for
every $1 spent. And then you get into it
and you're like, "Holy crap, this is
much better than I thought it would be."
&gt;&gt; It like went a lot higher than I
thought.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Cleaning businesses.
&gt;&gt; Really?
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; Residential, commercial, both.
&gt;&gt; Residential. Sorry. Residential.
Especially since after co like it just
went nuts. I think it went nuts.
Especially if you're in like if you do
like green cleaning. So like you use
like green chemicals. Not not like color
green, but like
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Gotcha. Gotcha.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. since co that's
absolutely taken off

[09:02]
absolutely taken off
&gt;&gt; still even five years later
&gt;&gt; even now even now
&gt;&gt; can you attach some numbers to that like
how well it works like what the return
on ad spend is like
&gt;&gt; I'm g I'm just going to give you average
the return on ad spend for two other
students were they were getting they
were closing leads at 45% and they're
getting leads for $30 $35
&gt;&gt; who
yeah so like5 $5 return.
&gt;&gt; $60 to close a customer that probably
pays three to 500 a month.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. At minimum. Minimum.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Cra Because if they're coming
every week, it could be 78 $900.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So, cleaning businesses do
really well. They do really well.
&gt;&gt; What's stopping someone listening to
this or watching that doesn't want to
start a cleaning business, but they
would love to sell leads to cleaning
businesses? Is that viable?
&gt;&gt; That is viable. I've never actually sold
leads before, but yeah, you could you
could do that. But again, it all it

[10:00]
could do that. But again, it all it
would all depend on your landing page,
your copy, your process. It could work.
I've never tried that before, but it
could work. I've known people that used
to do that for solar and roof. I know
people do it for roofing,
&gt;&gt; but I've never actually done it. I've
never seen I've never seen anyone say do
it for cleaning. That'd be interesting.
&gt;&gt; I think that could be a thing. It's
like, hey, I'm going to I'm going to
deliver these leads to you on a silver
platter. They'll be all but closed by
the time I hand them off to you and it's
200 bucks a piece.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You know, and you're paying 50 bucks to
acquire them.
&gt;&gt; That's it. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly.
&gt;&gt; What other niches have you seen this
work well for? Like I know it it can
work for just about anything, but in
your experience, where have you seen
success with Google ads and then andor
YouTube ads?
&gt;&gt; So solo ads, solar, especially YouTube.
Google it's a lot more it's a lot
tougher now with solar with with Google
because it's just man it's just really
really busy but again hardly hardly
anyone's using YouTube ads solar works
really well with YouTube roofing works
really well with YouTube yeah those are
probably my two main ones I have most

[11:01]
probably my two main ones I have most
experience with with YouTube would be
those those two are there
&gt;&gt; what are you seeing nowadays as far as
like cost per lead in roofing
&gt;&gt; that's a big big range there so I have a
client that's literally had to pause his
campaign. He's backlogged now.
&gt;&gt; It's a good problem to have.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a very good first world
problem.
&gt;&gt; What was his cost per lead?
&gt;&gt; So, he was getting leads for like
anywhere between 15 and 20 bucks.
&gt;&gt; No,
&gt;&gt; I'm 1,000% serious.
&gt;&gt; Now, you don't have to say the city. I
don't want to dox him, but like what
type of a market is this? Like a city, a
suburb? So he was focusing on
&gt;&gt; a radius around his city.
&gt;&gt; And was his city like in a big metroplex
or like out in the middle of nowhere
&gt;&gt; in Louisiana? I know it wasn't a big
massive
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; big massive metro area.
&gt;&gt; It's like $20 per lead. What was his
close rate?
&gt;&gt; About 25%.

[12:00]
&gt;&gt; About 25%.
&gt;&gt; So he's paying $100 to acquire a $7,000
customer
&gt;&gt; once he gets in their house. He gets
their house. Yeah. About 25% 30%. I love
looking at business very in a very
binary way. There's two problems that
every business face. There's two
buckets, right, that all problems fall
into. You got sales and marketing and
then you got fulfillment, right?
&gt;&gt; Bringing people in the door and then
taking care of them once they're inside
the house, right?
&gt;&gt; Pick your problems, right? So, most
people have, in my opinion, a customer
acquisition problem,
&gt;&gt; right? And it's easy to look at these
numbers and say, "Oh, I'm going to grow
a billion dollar roofing business
because I can I can acquire roofing
customers for 100 bucks each." A, the
market's not unlimited, right?
Louisiana's only so big. B, you got to
hire contractors, subs, your workers
comp insurance goes up. Like, it's not
just unlimited scaling, but in my
opinion, if I had to choose my problems,
I would much rather have a fulfillment
problem than a customer acquisition
problem, right? Because revenue solves
everything.
&gt;&gt; It does. Period.

[13:01]
&gt;&gt; It does. Period.
&gt;&gt; It solves everything,
&gt;&gt; man. 20 bucks a lead.
&gt;&gt; That was an outlier,
&gt;&gt; right? Because I know people paying1 to
$300 a roofing lead.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And that's that's usually what it
is. That's usually what it is. I've got
roofers down to $70 a lead, you know,
six, you know,
&gt;&gt; still 67 $67 a lead. Again, it it's all
on the landing page, man. It's on your
website, how your website's designed.
&gt;&gt; That's like the theme of this whole
episode is like
&gt;&gt; it's like Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Don't ignore the landing. Like don't
spend all your time on the in the ad
platform and then ignore your landing
page. Let the algorithm sort itself out.
You work on the landing page.
&gt;&gt; Exactly. Like if you are starting a new
business, right? If you're starting a
new business or if you have a
pre-existing business and you want to
scale it or you're struggling with with
getting new customers and new leads, the
first place I would look is your
website. I have people I can show you
here in a minute. I have a website. It's
not pretty. It's ugly, but it converts

[14:00]
not pretty. It's ugly, but it converts
at like 25%. Show me, dude. Right. So,
what are we talking about? So, we have
here's one that I really like. It
converts really well. You come on here,
okay? And you can see who they are, what
their offer is, how to contact them.
They got some social proof or they got
some more social proof down here. Okay.
The team like it's it's it's a very
clean, very simple Yep.
&gt;&gt; website. Okay.
&gt;&gt; Trust, authority, they feel good.
&gt;&gt; Exactly. you know, how can you help me?
Does it work? And will it work for
others? If your website can answer those
three things in the first 3 to 5
seconds, you have a good website.
&gt;&gt; All right, guys. You know, I'm always
looking for ways to help you make more
money with less effort, well, High Level
is, too. And I think that's why I like
it so much. While everyone else out
there is switching between 10 different
apps, HighLevel puts everything in one
clean dashboard. You can send emails,
track leads, build funnels, schedule
appointments, everything. And no more

[15:01]
appointments, everything. And no more
logging into a bunch of different
platforms. Your clients think you're
some tech wizard when really all you did
is stop making things so complicated.
Sometimes the best ideas are the simple
ones. So check out
gohighlevel.com/krisker
link below if you want to see what I
mean. If you use that link, they'll give
you a 30-day free trial. Real quick, I
know we're we're blurring out the URL,
but it looks to me like the URL is just
the domain name. It's not like a special
landing page. That is their homepage,
right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, so, so, yeah. So, this is
their homepage.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Right. So, I mean some some companies
they they have a landing page and a
website, but you can have a hybrid. You
can have a website that's also designed
as a landing page and it works really
well.
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; Right. This is the roofing one where I
was getting $20 leads. So, he was just
basically claim your free inspection.
will come out, look at your inspection,
and we're getting leads off of this for
like 20 bucks.
&gt;&gt; Oh, man. Dude. Okay, there's the
testimonials.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; What's crazy to me is they both kind of

[16:00]
&gt;&gt; What's crazy to me is they both kind of
are different. Both of these businesses
are different. Like the strategy is
different,
&gt;&gt; but they're both crushing it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. And so, like, no, I'm not
even kidding. This guy here had to
&gt;&gt; pause his campaign because he's
backlogged. And he's like, Marcus, I can
you pause ads? I'm like, what? What do
you mean pause ads? Like, you don't
pause ads. Can you stop printing money,
please?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly. So, so yeah, now here's
probably an uglier one, right?
&gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
&gt;&gt; So, this one still works really well,
right? But it could work better. But
she's very emotionally attached to this
image here, right?
&gt;&gt; The brand. Yeah,
&gt;&gt; the brand. I'm like, yeah, that's cool
and all, but
&gt;&gt; that's a lot of valuable real estate.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, her name is Jamie and this is
her cleaning business. I mean, wonderful
person, amazing entrepreneur, right? And
she's crushing it, man. Your website,
your landing page is going to be the
biggest needle mover in your entire

[17:00]
biggest needle mover in your entire
marketing machine.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Okay. These are incredible examples.
What about YouTube ads? What are some
best practices for YouTube ads? Like,
what how long should your ad be? What
type of video, vertical, horizontal,
etc.? So with YouTube ads, you want to
make sure you're running firstly
instream ads. Okay? So those are the
ones that pop up in the middle of of a
video. Okay. Inream ads. The quality of
a video is going to determine a largely
the the quality of placements that you
get on YouTube.
&gt;&gt; Right. Interesting.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So if you have like a bad script,
&gt;&gt; bad audio, bad quality video. Now, I'm
not saying you need like thousands of
dollars worth of fetching equipment. You
just need this like a good h a good
phone, you know, with a nice DJI mic or
whatever.
&gt;&gt; But if you have like a bad script and
low quality ad, you're gonna get
terrible place. You you'll show up in
like,

[18:01]
like,
&gt;&gt; you know, Cocoa Melon and all these kids
post. I'm not even kidding, bro. I'm not
even kidding.
&gt;&gt; That's crazy,
&gt;&gt; right? It's nuts. So So with your ad,
you don't need a five minute ad. No
one's gonna watch your ad for five
minutes. Heck, no one's even going to
watch your ad for a minute. So, with
your ad, you need a good hook.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; It's everything.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. The first five seconds of your ad
is going to be the most important part
of the entire thing. Okay. So, in your
ads, you really want to call out who you
want to talk to and get rid of everyone
else. That's the whole point of the
first five seconds is who do you want
your leads to be?
Who's your dream client? That way,
everyone else just clicks skip, right?
And then after that, you know, that's
when you go into basically the story
part of of your ad, which is what their
problem is, how you can fix their
problem, and maybe show some, you know,
like the whole point of the ad is to get

[19:00]
like the whole point of the ad is to get
a click. It's the whole point. It's not
to convince them to buy from you or to
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; It's just to get a click,
&gt;&gt; get to the landing page. You have too
many advertisers who are trying to sell
their product. Not I'm not talking about
e I'm not talking about e-commerce. I'm
talking about lead genen. You have too
many people trying to sell their product
on the ad. It that's not going to work.
Okay? Your ad generates a click. Your
landing page generates the lead. And
then when they talk to you, you generate
the sale. That's how it goes. So you
want to have a high CTR. You want to
have a high view rate on your ad. And if
you have a high a good CTR, a good view
rate, then you'll get good placements.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Right. So, you won't be showing up on
like Thomas the Tank Engine and Fetch
Coco Melon.
&gt;&gt; I'm picturing like the the formula for a
good ad. We've been talking about
cleaning businesses. I'm picturing like
a mom like emerging from like a pile of
trash in a teenager's bedroom, right?

[20:02]
trash in a teenager's bedroom, right?
And it's like, look familiar? You're a
single working mom and your teenage kids
are slobs, right? Sound familiar? We can
help with that. Check out Angie's
cleaning today.
&gt;&gt; Perfect.
&gt;&gt; Hook.
&gt;&gt; Perfect. Hook.
&gt;&gt; Describe the problem. Fix the problem.
Click here.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Perfect.
&gt;&gt; But then your landing page has to
convert. You're not done yet.
&gt;&gt; Your landing page has to convert. Okay.
&gt;&gt; And then your closing call has to
convert. You're not done yet.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So now one thing I love about
YouTube is the targeting. The targeting
on YouTube is insane. So what you can do
on the Google ads. So Google just so
everyone knows Google and owns YouTube.
So your Google search and your YouTube
ads are all on the same platform. When
you're running YouTube ads, you can say
go to Google. and say, "Hey, Google, I
want to target anyone who's typing in
these specific search terms on the
Google search bar with this ad." Or you

[21:02]
Google search bar with this ad." Or you
can say, "Hey Google, anyone who visits
this website or websites similar to
these ones, like your competitor
websites, for example,
&gt;&gt; I want to target those humans
&gt;&gt; or humans that are like them
&gt;&gt; because Google has so much data points
on all of us, right? They're going to be
the matrix soon. We know, we all know
that." And then another thing you could
do is you can say because Google has so
many data points on us and knows us
really well. It knows
what we're in market for. Okay? So it
has these pre-built inmarket audiences
where you can say, "Hey Google, I'm
going to target anyone that's in the
market for cleaning services or who's in
the market for roofing services." So
that's what I love about YouTube is you
can have these amazing audiences that
you can target with your ads. And
another great thing about YouTube and
and this is probably the most underused

[22:01]
and this is probably the most underused
advertising in all advertising and it
can be the most profitable if you do it
right. Remarketing. No one does
remarketing.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Okay. I literally just spent five bucks
a click, right? or two bucks or
sometimes up to $25 a click to get
someone to my landing page on my website
and they decided not to convert to a
lead.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. You're just going to forget about
them.
&gt;&gt; I'm going to forget about them. You
freaking kidding me?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Instead of remarketing separate
marketing campaign, right, with
remarketing ads and send them to a
different landing page with a special
offer that didn't have before. And this
offer is only for those
&gt;&gt; who you're remarketing to. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Hey, get 20% off your first cleaning a
special offer where you're going to help
them to convert. So, like if you're an
already pre-existing business and you're
already running Facebook ads to a page,
right, to like your website to a landing

[23:00]
right, to like your website to a landing
page or if you're or you're a local
business running Google ads to your
website, okay, you need to set up
remarketing 10,000%. You can do it
through YouTube. You can do it do
through display, right? Display like
little banner ads that pop up all over
the place that are really annoying.
Yeah, that could be you.
&gt;&gt; I'm trying to put together a framework
for this because I see this all the time
across all areas of business and you
call it like the this one more step,
right? Let's say with your Google
business profile, sometimes good is the
enemy of great. And people hear reviews
are everything. Reviews are everything.
I have a cleaning business. All right,
I'm going to ask for reviews. Cool. You
do it and then you stop because you're
like, I do what I'm supposed to do. I'm
doing the right thing. And you're you're
good. you're probably ahead of like 60%
of other people, but then they stop,
right? Whereas, if they were to go one
more step and say, "I'm going to
regularly update my Google business
profile and say, hey, just cleaning
Angie's house today. Hey, just" that
sends a signal to Google that like
you're extra invested and like you'll
get three times more results out of your

[24:00]
get three times more results out of your
Google business profile, right? But
sometimes we do one good thing and then
we think we're done. So, with this, it's
like, "All right, I know that Google ads
are important. I'm gonna All right, I
know the landing page is important.
Landing page, Google ads, they're
converting. I'm done. Now I'll go back
to running my business. It's like, whoa,
whoa, just one more step and start
retargeting. And like, you're in the top
10% now. Congratulations. But the
difference between the top 10% and the
top 1% is a factor of 10. Right. So,
just please just take one more step, do
the remarketing, and you will be in the
top 1% and you can have a $7 million
business instead of a $2 million
business.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. And it doesn't take
a lot of effort like to do these little
steps that you talk about doesn't like
to
&gt;&gt; let's let's split test top of the fold
on our on our website, right? Let's just
let's split one one thing
&gt;&gt; once a month is the biggest thing
headline, right? Or let's put a try VSSL
or whatever, right? Just all these
little let's let's tweak up our ad to
see if we can get our our CTR higher

[25:02]
see if we can get our our CTR higher
tweak our ad copy. Just all these little
bits once a month makes a huge huge
difference. But as you said, good's the
greatest enemy of great.
&gt;&gt; Quick question. What if there were a
private community out there of people
that were building businesses based on

tkowners.com link in the show notes.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, YouTube ads is a fantastic
avenue for local server businesses,
particularly if you're already running
Google ads.
&gt;&gt; Is there a specific type of offer or
industry in general that you think works
well for YouTube ads better than others?
&gt;&gt; So, you really want to have you really
do want to have a special offer, right?

[26:00]
do want to have a special offer, right?
So, if it's like a discount on
something, like a special discount, for
example, if you're like a carpet
cleaner, right, you're running a special
offer and you're get one room, you know,
you get two rooms cleaned, you get
another one for free or or whatever or
something like that, right? Those are
really good. This is the order operation
I would do my marketing, right? First
thing I do if I'm local service
business, so local service business, I
would do run Google ads. Once I got
Google ads up and running and it's I'm
getting regular leads, I know my target
se I know what my target cost per
acquisition is, right? I will then set
up YouTube ads for lead genen. YouTube
ads for lead genen to target inmarket
audiences, website visitors, and keyword
Google search keywords. Once that
started rolling really well and I wanted
to scale it to the next level, I would
then run uh brand awareness campaigns
where now you're just going out to the
masses. So there's no targeting. It's
all broad.
&gt;&gt; You're going to everyone in a 30-mi

[27:01]
&gt;&gt; You're going to everyone in a 30-mi
radius around Orlando or wherever, okay?
And you're just hitting everyone. And
then at the same time though, I would
also be setting up a remarketing at the
very beginning. Anyone that's coming to
any of my websites, my paid websites or
my organic website, whatever,
&gt;&gt; I'm tracking all that in Google.
&gt;&gt; And anyone who does not convert, they're
they're going to see my ad. They're
going to see my YouTube ad. They're
going to see my banner ad when they go
to some website, see my face everywhere.
Put my Facebook pixel on there so they
can see you on Facebook. Your brand is
going to be everywhere if you do
remarketing. That's how I would do that.
&gt;&gt; Oh, it's beautiful. Like remarketing is
the difference between spending $10 to
acquire a customer and $6, right? Like
it makes a big difference
&gt;&gt; or even cheaper than that.
&gt;&gt; Oh, Marcus, I have a headache. That's
always a good sign.
is very thorough, very exhaustive. Thank
you. We're going to link to your
business in the show notes. Anything
else you'd like to leave us with?

[28:00]
else you'd like to leave us with?
&gt;&gt; The only thing, okay, I can't stress
this enough. If you're a new business
owner and you're doing something you
really enjoy doing, okay, and you start
marketing, you need to be patient. One
of the best things that business new
business owners can do is like reach out
to people, people you know in your
network and try and do work for them for
free for testimonials.
&gt;&gt; That will help your marketing so much
better. That will help your conversion
rate happen so much more.
&gt;&gt; If you can show that your solution can
help other people who have a problem,
&gt;&gt; it's going to make your conversion rate
so much higher. So go out, get those
testimonials, work for free. Okay. So, I
sold my marketing business in Australia.
When I moved here to to the US, I
started a new business here in the US.
No one knows who I am.
&gt;&gt; No one knows who I am. So, what I do, I
literally reached out to people in my
church. I
&gt;&gt; reached out to me.

[29:00]
&gt;&gt; reached out to me.
&gt;&gt; I reached out to Yeah, I did. I did
reach out to you. I did. I reached out
to my network. I said, "Hey, this is
what I do. I will help you with this.
All I want is a testimonial. You have to
pay me nothing. All I want is a
testimonial. Some people will say yes
and they'll come through. Some people
say yes and they'll fall through or you
know don't work. Some people say no. But
get those testimonials first. Okay. Once
you have that
&gt;&gt; and a lot of times those those free
friends and family customers will end up
paying you anyway.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, they do. They literally do. Like I
literally reached out. He is a dental
anesthesiologist.
I'm in the process of helping him. But
see, he knows dentists. So right now I
have three dentists that I'm working
with and bringing them help and they're
YouTubers, right? So
&gt;&gt; yeah.
&gt;&gt; So take the time, reach out to your
network,
&gt;&gt; work for free. I know it sucks, but it's
it's worth it's an investment in your
business. Then work on your landing
page. Your landing page needs to solve

[30:02]
page. Your landing page needs to solve
say three things within the first five
seconds. how you can help them with
their problem, testimonials like
reviews, right? And how they can contact
you, right? That's really the the three
main things you need to have. Once you
have that down, start running ads. And
here's the key. You need to be patient.
This is like with Google, the Google Ads
platform, the great thing about Google
Ads compared to Facebook is the quality
that comes from Google is like 10 times
higher. So roofing companies for
example, they'll get leads for like
&gt;&gt; higher intent
&gt;&gt; 30 bucks off of these Facebook lead
forms,
&gt;&gt; but half of them are vast majority of
duds.
&gt;&gt; Well, it's because they're not on
Facebook actively looking for a new
role, but they go to Google for that.
&gt;&gt; The intent is not there, right?
&gt;&gt; So, you need to be patient. This is like
a threemonth process minimum
&gt;&gt; to really get this humming.
&gt;&gt; That's probably the best way to start
out if you're wanting a if you want to
start a new business. It's the best way
to start out.
&gt;&gt; Work for free.
&gt;&gt; Amazing advice.

[31:00]
&gt;&gt; Amazing advice.
&gt;&gt; And then be patient
&gt;&gt; for any business, but especially this.
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; Marcus, you're the man. Thank you.
&gt;&gt; No worries. Thanks, Chris.
&gt;&gt; All right. What' you think? Please share
it with a friend and we'll see you next
time on the Kerner
