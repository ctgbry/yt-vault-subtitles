[00:00]
welcome to the ker office the show for
more business ideas and growth
strategies and deep Dives than your
brain even has the space to comprehend
I'm Chris Kerner and today I had my good
friend Sam Thompson back on the Pod and
guys think about it I only have people
back on the Pod because their pods do
well because you guys like them and you
listen to them all the way through and
you say Chris please bring Shannon or
Sam or Nick or Connor back on that's why
he's back on because they're great
guests Sam and I talked about a bunch of
things such as cloning as in digital
cloning using AI clone yourself clone
others charge people for access to yours
or someone else's clone be an agent for
people that might have data worth
cloning we talked about some cool
digital product opportunities some new
tech out there lots of cool business
ideas Sam lives in the digital world
when it comes to startups and
Entrepreneurship so he is a good
counterbalance to myself and other
guests that are more likely to talk
about physical products or physical
service businesses or sweaty startups so

[01:00]
service businesses or sweaty startups so
I like to have a little bit of
everything on the Pod so enjoy share
with a friend and we'll see you next
[Music]
time so we got friend of the Pod back on
Sam Thompson we're GNA Riff on some
ideas I have no idea what this episode
will bring we didn't share any notes he
doesn't know what I've got I don't know
what he's got how you doing Sam oh
another day another data set can't
complain dude just out here ripping
ideas left and right taking sales calls
sending emails dude life of a Hustler
bro that's right these are all the shiny
objects that we don't chase that someone
should oh the absolute battle to not
Chase these things is so real a lot of
times the shiny object is more
profitable or promising than what you're
doing that's the hard part period is
like especially in early stage stuff
right especially like services like all
of that the margin hit that you take
once you get north of 20 or 30k a month
is like it's meaningful and you actually

[02:00]
is like it's meaningful and you actually
it and it changes what the business is
where it's like hey is this like
becoming an Enterprise Value play where
this thing can exist without me or am I
trying to stack as much cash as humanly
possible right now as an individual and
like that Dynamic has been weird with
the shiny object of like I can go make
monthly personally more money by doing
this thing but there's no like I don't
want to say there's no value in it but
like much less than what I currently do
that's been the thought process a lot of
like we're doing big things that quicker
and unlimited and all of that like yeah
I could go probably spend that time and
energy on something else that would be
higher profit margins or like more
personal income based in a shorter
amount of time but no matter what I'm
always going to hit the point that a
limit is at we're like oh are we going
to scale this or like am I going to be a
glorified freelancer forever running
this little thing and it's like the
decision-making process there so
interesting and at the end of the day it

[03:01]
interesting and at the end of the day it
doesn't matter which path you choose
because compounding doesn't care you
just got to keep grinding you just got
to keep doing the thing dude is the
conversation I had with Connor abony the
other day I was like what am I gonna
spend my time on if I want to add stuff
I want to like I got to take stuff off
my plate and he was like why just work
harder I was like Parkinson's law like
shoot dude you're not
wrong there you go sometimes you just
got to do it hit me with something give
me a hit oh man dude I think so I was
talking to a buddy of mine the other
night successful dude sold his agency
actually funny enough getting kind of
into the Global Talent space the whole
thing and we were having a similar
conversation and we were talking about
something that you and I have talked
about before which is selling digital
products at scale right and I think the
the world has gotten used to that a
little bit more with these people that
are talking about selling products on
Etsy and it's like hey we're going to go

[04:00]
Etsy and it's like hey we're going to go
build like a notion template that you
can go and buy right or similar to like
on our last episode the custom signature
thing like what are these things that
are like super low cogs that you can
scale up with payat custom signature
cogs are $2 they're charging us 80 right
and I think there's a world that can
exist there in the digital product space
and I think I wrote a tweet on this two
years ago about the easiest way to make
100K a year it might be putting out AI
generated content templates whatever
that means running ads pushing on Etsy
and just slinging these digital products
where it's like you can charge $40 for a
new mom organization notion
template right you can create it to be
super niched down and just go absolutely
sling that on any of these marketplaces

[05:02]
sling that on any of these marketplaces
that exist for that sort of stuff then
you layer in paid ads Etsy has their own
advertising product like there's stuff
you can do to kind of scale that up I'm
interested in that space of like you
could pick any Niche how to bake the
perfect muffin right or like there's so
many little things like that that like
sure you're not going to go launch a
$2,500 course on that but do I think you
could get 3,000 moms in Middle America
to like buy your notion template for 30
bucks and go make a 100 Grand I
do 100% at that price point $30 to $50
is it if you had to rely on paid ads is
that expensive enough to make a profit
or do you need a higher ticket offer
down the funnel I understand exactly
what you're saying it's gonna be so Case
by case right like you might be able to
in in a the fitness Niche you might be
able to charge more but your your C or

[06:00]
able to charge more but your your C or
your CAC will be higher cost of
acquisition dude there's a billion
niches for this like you could create a
daily prayer
book right where it's like yep there's
365 prayer slj Journal prompts in this
thing and it's meant for high school
seniors right like you can just Niche
down into it and it's like you just have
to Snapchat ads yeah you know what I'm
saying there's so many channels it's
like the thing that I like about digital
products especially for people that are
like stepping into entrepreneurship and
are specifically interested in like
online Digital internet stuff the
weight
on inventory fulfillment servicing stuff
like all of that it just disappears and
I think that it forces people like the
exercise of launching a or multiple
digital products and trying to find
channels that are profitable and work

[07:01]
channels that are profitable and work
like I think if someone spent six months
doing that testing different niches
different products different
positionings I think what they would
learn in that six months about
advertising how customers think Niche
selection product positioning I just
think that
there's so much that could be derived
out of that experience not to mention
like again you could spend it's like we
talked about the signatures it's like
even if you're selling a product for 30
bucks and you can reliably acquire a
customer for
$20 digital product you can go and spend
$2,000 a day on ads which sounds like a
lot to some people but you're not going
to jump into doing that but like you
spend $2,000 and you earn
$3,000 if you do that every single day
you just made $30,000 that month which
is like simplifying it but like at the

[08:00]
is like simplifying it but like at the
end of the day it's like if you can find
a product that has a big enough
market and the nice thing with digital
products is like you can manipulate your
offer by typing different words right
like yeah you can change a Daily Journal
from being a mom's Daily Journal to a
high school Daily Journal in five clicks
like not even to mention bringing AI
into the equity you can go make 15
digital products tonight please create
an ebook about ABC and d and go test
this
and so I think that that's like it's the
lesson I think people do this all the
time with Drop Shipping products they'll
spend six to 12 months sourcing these
random things from China like your Bears
right and the testing sourcing all right
I broke even I lost money and made a
little money and then they find a winner
and then they go all in which is great
but why not do the exact same thing for
a digital product and then you don't
have any of that fulfillment risk or
headache even if you're Drop Shipping
you're technically not fulfilling it you
got to wait two weeks you're going to
have refund fund issues stripe is going

[09:00]
have refund fund issues stripe is going
to cancel you it is a grind you got to
develop the Shopify sight so I like that
framework I especially I know you've
seen this so I won't even ask if you
have those ads they're all copying each
other they have the same copy and it's
like it's not cheap it's not cheap
because X have you seen that yeah I've
seen them dude I'm gonna read one I got
it pulled up right here it's not cheap
it's true some full-size fridges cost
less than this mini fridge yes we could
have made it cheaper but then it'd be
cheap it wouldn't sound silent in your
living room it wouldn't be made with
steel that's three times thicker it
wouldn't double as a bar cart it
wouldn't come with a 10-year warranty y
Yad y it wouldn't have a 4.95 rating
have won gq's home Awards y it looked
cheap it feel cheap it worked cheap and
cheap sucks like those ads kill it so
good right and so so good why not do the
same thing for a digital product so back
to the mom's idea I was just emailing
with a woman who I might have her on the
pod she makes 650 Grand a year

[10:02]
pod she makes 650 Grand a year
Consulting New Moms on sleep schedules
it's she's like a sleep consultant for
new moms and getting their babies to
sleep through the night I've had three
or four friends pay people for that yeah
a good offer and so instead of selling a
product that solves the same thing make
it a tenth of the price which is still
$300 instead of 3,000 and that's your ad
copy it's like it's not cheap that's
$300 for a PDF yeah we own that but how
expensive is your sleep or your sanity
or your mental Clarity or your mental
health and just going like wait yeah
what I'm supposed to be sleeping a third
of my day I'm Only Sleeping a tenth of
my day because of this baby I need to
get the baby of of course $300 is worth
it so just take the same strategy with
physical products and make your digital
$30 product 10 times more
expensive I'm not mad why not yeah I
think that attracts like and the nice
part is with that model you can just

[11:02]
part is with that model you can just
test all of it right like go build two
landing pages one with it priced at 79
one that is priced at 300 run the ads
see which one is profitable see what
your CAC is like play the exact same
game you don't even need to you can just
use like most people don't use Shopify
for digital sales but you can you
certainly can and Shopify has apps that
enable you to AB test prices right that
way you don't need multiple landing
pages right right right I think it's the
probably the least amount of friction to
start that
business like you are not relying on
booking calls you're not relying on
inventory you're not relying on a team
right like it is you and a PDF and you
are just trying to sell that PDF and
like longtail like short term you're
learning you're testing you're making
some cash longtail the goal really would
be like don't always just try to sell
something that will sell but like like
selling niches that you have some

[12:01]
selling niches that you have some
expertise are interest in because if you
can get people if you can get 3,000 moms
to buy a guide about XY or Z you now
have 300 moms that are customers of
yours that you can also sell other
things and so it's like step into
whatever Niche you're looking to step
into and be like hey I'm really
interested in helping roofers do
whatever cool go sell a digital product
to roofers and just try to break even
top of funnel and then you can go and
sell them services or you can go and
build the software for them or you can
go and do kind of whatever and it's like
it's the V1 of like what clickfunnels
did right like Russell Brunson basically
was like we're going to run this digital
product called do com Secrets as a book
that you can buy if you want to make
more money on the internet you buy do
com secrets and then on the back end of
that was I mean they have a slew of
digital products that are higher tickets
but also their software the number one

[13:01]
but also their software the number one
thing that entrepreneurs like that are
starting out have to prove to themselves
is that they can acquire customers
that's it if you can get leads and get
sales I would say it's the 8020 right if
you can't get leads the business dies so
prove that you can do that learn how to
do that like how it's like what we're
doing with unlimited like we're proving
that I can book 20 calls a week with
Facebook ads sick like it makes the rest
of the business 10 times easier because
there's top of funnel Revenue like
growing like the rest of it solves
itself because of
that yeah all right I just got an idea
as you were talking so have you heard of
dely delphy AI I don't think so there's
a few companies doing this they
basically enable you to clone yourself
it's like an llm it's kind of pointed
more towards people making content on
the internet as opposed to the

[14:00]
the internet as opposed to the
non-content creators yeah I think it's
really interesting I tested this like
nine months ago I had like an account
manager I was a beta user I was not
impressed it was very manual I send them
my Google Drive links YouTube videos and
it just wasn't great but I think it's
gotten a ton better and it's only going
to get better for sure and so I want to
use it eventually to upload all my stuff
and then maybe you could have me as a
business partner for 20 bucks a month
right you know as opposed to having to
give an business partner equity and you
could just chat with me whenever you
want right what tool would you use if I
did this what tool would you use if I
did that how should I structure my
partnership with this real business
partner and you'll just pull on
everything I've said about business
Partnerships or anything right so that's
cool but why not be like an agent like a
talent agent by finding people that will
never hear about dely for years or
anything like dely may maybe they're
creating a lot of content and doing it
all for them and really you're just like
uploading all their content and like

[15:01]
uploading all their content and like
prompt engineering a little bit and like
packaging it nicely and pricing it and
then taking like a 30% cut of their
lifetime earnings like yeah yeah I was
looking at the top 10,000 School groups
and we had a podcast about this Nick and
I a few weeks ago and like the 13th most
profitable School group Skol it was like
80 grand a month some jazz guitarist in
Spain named Mark Andre who teaches jazz
guitar and it's like he's on he's got
YouTube he has a course you could do
that I call this the ethical bait and
switch where you reach out to him and
you're like hey I put an llm together of
all of your content so I cloned you all
right if you are watching this clip
right now you are watching this on
YouTube and if you are a fan of podcast
please check out my podcast while you're
at it because sometimes I have podcasts
that aren't on YouTube and sometimes I
have YouTubes that aren't on podcast so
check out the cner office on any podcast
platform or you can go to TKO pod.com
also my newsletter will throw that in
there no ads It's weekly it's different

[16:00]
there no ads It's weekly it's different
content than my podcast and YouTube
newsletter. chrisj cerner.com You'll see
the link and we'll see you there hey by
the way I I cloned you would you like to
see your clone yeah and then once they
respond you're like oh shoot I better
clone them yeah you you make clone
because you know only 5% of people will
respond right so then you clone them and
then it's like here's the pitch you're G
to give me your course I'll buy your
course give it to me for free whatever
I'll go all to all your publicly facing
YouTube channels I'll take all of your
content you ever made ever stuff in your
Google Drive that you never shared I'll
prompt engineer it I I'll make sure that
like it you don't sound like an idiot
when people ask you questions and then
we're going to charge 20 bucks a month
to it you're going to pitch it to your
followers I'm G to take 30% and I'll run
the whole business what do you think oh
in love with it own a domain that I had
a very similar concept for two years ago
TR signal.com dude cut through the
noise shiny object that was never
pursued we tried it like the whole basis
of it I did this thing with Connor abony

[17:00]
of it I did this thing with Connor abony
a while
ago that was basically like texting as a
service I buil I did a live chat of that
right like Casey where I built this
thing but there was a real person on the
back of it and AI now makes that 10
times more possible where it's like
there's so many of those tools that are
like like intro intro is like that or
Mentor pass right where it's like you
can sign up and get direct access to one
of these thought leaders experts CEOs
whatever to get their
insights the challenge with that as some
I like know a bunch of guys that are on
intro as experts or on Mentor pass they
don't have the time and so it's like
yeah that's a good offer you come in and
say look I'm G to grab all of your
content and turn you into a model that
allows for you to support people at
scale and we can drop the price because
of it instead of you charging 500 bucks
for a 30 minute call you can charge 20
bucks a month for people to be able to
just message message with you that's not

[18:00]
just message message with you that's not
really you it's again it's 8020 it's
like they'll get the majority of the
value out of that experience with an AI
version of you yeah you they might not
get some of the details but they're also
paying 5% of what it would cost and so I
think it's like I think it's a good
model one as a as an operator to go and
do that I also think it gets
fun on like on a Humanity level I think
it like content already allows for a
shared learning to happen a lot faster
as a community of entrepreneurs we are
learning 10 times faster because
everyone is sharing content about what
they're learning and so I can learn from
your mistakes so that I don't make them
and that's awesome it's moving
entrepreneurship forward as a societal
thing but I think doing this where it's
like taking
content it's just creating a bridge
between the content that exists and
helping people apply it to very specific
problems that they have right

[19:01]
problems that they have right
like oh I know Chris has talked about
this on the Pod but like I don't what
episode and like myself right right same
where I'm like I don't want to go like
love you to death you're my dog the only
episodes that I watch fully are the ones
that I'm on right and I'm like I want to
know what you and Nick are talking about
and how it can help me on X Y and Z the
challenge is there's just 15 of my
friends that have podcasts like that and
I don't have that much time and I'm like
number 13 on the priority scale right I
get it look it is what it
is no you're moving up the ranks dude
okay cool cool cool but yeah and so I do
think I think that there is a place for
that in the content
Consulting like space like I think that
is cool and someone's going to do it
they obviously are yeah I want every
listener every time we talk about like
content or making content like all of
these principles can be applied by

[20:00]
these principles can be applied by
working with or through a content
creator because 90 plus% people will
never create content which is fine but
100% of people has the opportunity wide
open to them to partner with someone
that's doing it to leverage their
distribution Their audience literally
here's another idea this could be like
uh an upsell or it could be the same
product so you partner with Mark Andre
to sell jazz guitar coaching 20 and it
doesn't even replace the course it
doesn't cannibalize it it's just
different and then the upsell is an
accountability partner for
Mark and I think this needs to be done
via text message via IMS specifically
for I because if it's a standalone app
it's like that's hard it's hard to get
how many messaging apps do we have too
many right too many yeah but if it's
just if it's just a number it's like
Chris Ker's cell phone number we're just
texting we're BR hey man I'm running
this Facebook ads campaign my CPM is

[21:01]
this Facebook ads campaign my CPM is
this is this good for this industry what
would I say to that right yep and it can
also be in accountability but hey have
you built your MVP yet hey have you
gotten your first customer today yet hey
mixing in personal stories Dude where's
your bias for Action because when I did
this I launched it in three hours and I
have you know what I'm saying like oh
gosh it's like yeah it's like dude
you've been trying to set up your LLC
weeks like what are we doing right yeah
if AI girlfriends are bringing up or are
blowing up then why not AI business
partners yeah AI mentors no I'm trust
I'm on the same wave we've done it we've
proven that offer works with a non AI
person right like we've
put I did it back when I was working at
work week because they have all their
creators right and so we built this
system that basically would allow for
people to sign up for sms-based cohorts
with these experts right and so it's

[22:01]
with these experts right and so it's
like a little bit more
structured than just like an available
chatbot right because we tried that and
the challenge was retention or like you
not even retention usage was weird
because you weren't prompting anything
right versus saying hey in the next
month of your access to this we're going
to share ABC and D every other day and
then you have the opportunity to talk to
the Creator directly and we just I mean
dude the MVP was so simple it was like a
landing page with a stripe checkout once
they paid they gave us their phone
number and we added them to open phone
and we just ran the whole thing out of
open phone I would have used I would
have used send
blue which is an awesome shout shout out
to the boys over there I think he might
have sold that company but it's an
iMessage API and so the messages come
through blue and so your read rate goes
up your reply rate goes up like all of
the things we did one or two Co and
maybe made 10 grand in the month of

[23:00]
maybe made 10 grand in the month of
trying it on the back of one Creator
just like AI was not where it was two
years ago when I did that or how did it
go though like how was the reception or
the Churn it was good yeah I mean
because we well we so we only did it as
a one time by we didn't do monthly
recurring which I think is important for
stuff like this like I've been thinking
about it a lot on just pricing CU like
unlimited pricing I'm just paying
attention to like what pricing does to
things and
I think that for something like that
let's just say the goal is to sell it
for 20 bucks a month I think that you're
better off just only offering annual
pricing right we're like dude the the
big thing that I hate watching
entrepreneurs deal with and we deal with
it all the time like churn like battling
churn on
specifically low ticket
consumer products like this if this was
20 bucks a month we deal with it on
Creative OS like it's just an

[24:01]
Creative OS like it's just an
interesting one and so if you're already
going to put all this money and effort
behind getting them to buy I would
recommend doing only an annual plan at
250 because it's not like your annual
plan's three grand it's like it's 250
yeah get the support for a year from XY
or Z person for 299 or 249 or whatever
that is and I don't think you see like a
crazy drop in conversion rate between 20
bucks a month versus 249 for the year
but then you don't have to battle churn
as aggressively like emotionally like
yeah you know what I mean well I think
it's especially important for something
like this because if if someone doesn't
adapt in that first month to really
chatting with clone yeah they're they're
totally gone and you have to just like
on subscription people don't think about
that stuff they're like oh I just the Mr
number is going up and it's like bro
like I promise you you should be paying
attention to your 30-day cohort 90-day
cohort
and like really locking in on the act

[25:01]
and like really locking in on the act
like activation for this that first
seven days like the amount of effort and
energy and intentionality that you need
to put into the activation of like how
do you turn somebody that's not used to
talking to an AI Via SMS into somebody
that does that regularly how do you
train them teach them help them learn
how to extract that value I mean even
the one that you just sent with Deli
delie like when you open up one of the
profiles it gives you a list of like
here's 15 sample questions to ask click
on one of them right like that's an
activation mechanism for them like how
do we get them to start the conversation
easier right like and learn I mean even
chat GPT has those in there like you
open a new chat there's four options
right and so understanding that on a low
ticket consumer product like that
getting your product so ingrained in
their normal behavior is almost more
challenging than acquiring them at the
top
like finding the user is not the hard

[26:01]
like finding the user is not the hard
part I put that tweet out yesterday like
the two growth levers for early stage
businesses are not necessarily like your
CAC and CPA like it's your retention and
referral like it's so product L
especially when you have recurring
Services because you are trying to keep
them around you're selling a onetime
product it's a CA to aov game like but
on recurring you have to
Market even on websites you have to
Market and sell the entire time like you
don't stop selling and marketing your
product when somebody signs up yeah like
you have to keep reminding them of the
value and keep providing the value and
keep helping them extract the value if
you're trying to build something that's
like sustainable longer term or you
should just go sell a course that you
just sell at three grand and like Get
your cash out the best way to learn how
to do all these things is to go sign up
for something like zapier or pipe drive

[27:00]
for something like zapier or pipe drive
or like a software that's growing so
fast and just look at their funnel what
are they doing what are they hitting you
with and when what type of messaging and
why it's like the it's like the Facebook
rule zap ear is perfect bro yeah the
sooner you add 10 friends on Facebook
the less likely you are to turn it's the
same and that is the definition of
activation that was their metric what
does activation mean like on this it
would be you just recognize the pattern
where it's like all right they sign up
if people that send more than 10
messages to the bot in the first 48
hours are X percentage more likely to
pay for the second month okay cool how
do we incentivize them to send those 10
messages in a way that makes sense right
like you have to just force the function
I think the genius of this idea is it
makes activation even easier because of
the fact that it's a two-way
conversation if I sign up for zapier and
I start getting five spam emails from

[28:01]
I start getting five spam emails from
them a day if you tried this zap if you
tried this have you tried our web hooks
have you tried this tables right it's
like dude I'm I'm done but if I sign up
for a service that is designed to
message to it and and from me then it's
not going to be intrusive if I get a
text saying hey why don't you start a
stump grinding business today here's how
I would do it just like planting ideas
like man this guys actually giv me a lot
of value huh okay it's a chat it's not a
spam email right yeah especially if you
can get the context and like yeah all of
that I think it's interesting and it's
not
technically the most challenging to
build you could build that entire thing
off zapier and like an afterno if you
want to and you're listening to this go
to Twitter advance search and just type
in hey casey.com
and you'll see my entire threat on how
to build this exact thing just plug in
AI was that that's it you're good it's
like a lot of these creators like Mr

[29:01]
like a lot of these creators like Mr
Beast they're tackling the hardest
Industries right consumer package Goods
chocolate bars Lunchables like if Mr
Beast had some sort of a software
product I feel like that's where
creators going to have to head to
actually make money is having a SAS
product this could be it personalized to
each of them you know if you're a beauty
influencer then beauty tips right right
upload a picture you know use
upload a selfie every morning and be
like all right what shade of makeup
should I put on today here's my outfit
what should I do with my eyeliner ey
Shadow that's I think we're moving away
from what looks cool to what does my
favorite Creator think I should do or
what would they wear today or what would
they look like today you know yeah I'm
not mad at that at all man it's testable
for
sure yeah you could test it without
building it you know what I mean like
just build an LP with an email for a
wait list and be like I'm launching this

[30:03]
wait list and be like I'm launching this
have a direct conversation with me
whenever you want via iMessage sign up
for the wait list instead of asking for
their email get their phone number
duh right and then just plop them into a
conversation with you yo what's up I'm
Chris and just see what happens oh man
and then the upsells after that are
endless well you also just have a direct
communication channel right everyone's
sitting here being like yo you have to
have a newsletter because what if the
algo changes I'm like I don't want to
run a newsletter I just want everyone's
phone number I want to text you like
yeah you know it's like I forget the
stats the next Frontier dude I'm open
rate yeah i'ms for sure especially with
stuff like send blue like the iMessage
API is a hack because you're not the
issue with SMS is really like the
character limits
right it's like it gets I forget the

[31:00]
right it's like it gets I forget the
number but it's like 20 times as
expensive to send SMS as it is
email right email is so cheap you can go
have 10,000 contacts on convertkit or
beehive or whatever for like hundred
bucks but like when twio is charging you
0.04 cents an SMS end your list of
10,000 people it's going to cost you 40
bucks or 400 bucks or whatever the math
is and so it's like you'd go to an
iMessage JPI where it's not sms-based
you don't have the character limits you
don't have the MMS triple credit stuff
and so like I think that's a bigger
unlock than people think just because
you could send me an 1,800 word text via
iMessage that doesn't count as 10
credits and cost you 40 cents to
actually send to me you know what I mean
yeah yeah it's an interesting be cool if
you could yeah if
like let's say in my example I would

[32:01]
like let's say in my example I would
upload a clone of me and then as like a
bonus or maybe even included free it's
like all of Gary Vee's content or
something you'd have trademark issues
and all that but all of whatever XYZ
business content that's like a thousand
times more content than what I'm
providing and you could have a little
toggle if it was in an app in the app or
you could just preface a text message
with a symbol or something it's like all
right do I want to ask Chris or do I
want to ask
business database yeah you know what I'm
saying yeah because it's like okay
that's what Chris thinks what does this
guy think or what does the general
public think or what is like the
entrepreneurship subreddit think not
that they're going to let you scrape
their whole subreddit but you get what
I'm saying
right they'll let
us yeah as if I asked permission right
what I'm saying I don't know that's so
funny well I like that idea all so
that's two ideas I think there's a lot
of places you could go with both of

[33:00]
of places you could go with both of
those right like use that as the seed
and go play
like I think it's pretty dope all right
what else you got for me you got
anything good there's like a broad
stroke concept that I'm really
interested in everyone's pretty familiar
with the decoupling of Craigslist right
have you seen that graphic where it's
like Craigslist broken out unbundling
yeah whatever so it's like Home Sharing
or renting turned into Airbnb and this
turned into that and this turned into
that ride sharing
yeah right all of it and so it's like
Craigslist was the OG all of these
products came out of that and so what I
started think about was like what are
what's today's Craigslist right like
what are businesses that are just so big
that like could be unbundled to some
degree and I think it's data like I
think hyp
specific data products for two reasons
they function similar to like similarly
to the digital ones right like hey this

[34:03]
to the digital ones right like hey this
is low
cogs for you to run there's so many no
code tools that are literally designed
for databases of service companies like
a dollo air do it bubble air table like
creative OS is a version of that right
where it's like where're software but
it's a data company we just our data
asset is creative templates that are
high performing for Facebook
and so like the infrastructure for that
technically speaking is not super
challenging it's just how do you display
organize and allow for people to
discover the data and then I look at
companies like Zoom info or Apollo
or whatever right or like get Cyber
leads there's these companies that like
have all of these massive lead lists
that have basically just scraped all of
LinkedIn and the value prop that they're
coming to
or whatever right all of that and so

[35:00]
or whatever right all of that and so
they come in and they say our value prop
is twofold but they really focus on the
quantity of the data like if you go read
these guys websites they're like we have
10 plus million contacts we have 100
million contacts we have 30 million
contacts means it all sucks right right
and I'm like but all dude these
companies just keep paying because they
can get the data out of those 30 million
contacts that they're looking for
those products are also generally
speaking a little bit more expensive
Zoom info specifically serves a much
more Enterprise like B2B world but like
we want that same with builtwith is
another one dude like bu the number of
times people hit me up saying yo can I
borrow your builtwith account to grab
one list I just need one list I don't
want to pay $400 a month to get this one
list do you have a paid account no not
anymore yeah one list I paid for it and
then everyone

[36:00]
then everyone
asked dude I'm sure their turn is
probably stupid insane but also they're
like serving a totally different
customer right but it's like okay what
happens if I say I have a bunch of
relationships in the e-commerce ageny
space and all these guys want more leads
okay I'm gonna go on upwork and I'm
gonna ask somebody to go scrape me the
contact info of the top three decision
makers on every single Shopify Plus
store right shop plus they're $2,000 or
more get that list put that list into ad
dollo bubble web flow airtable one of
these glide apps right like one of these
kind of data visualization tools that
like makes it easier and then just put a
pay wall on that right where it's like
hey for $299 a year you can get access
to every single top performing Ecom
Brands decision makers
right and you just put a comparison like

[37:01]
right and you just put a comparison like
against Apollo directly like you're
either going to pay them
$1500 a year for messy data that's hard
to get to who you're looking for we have
a very specific list of these people
that you can now get access to for a
third of the price on an annual basis
again I would do annual pricing on that
not monthly right and then you go okay
here's our tool and then it's really
like from a from an operator perspective
you only are really trying to do two
things which is one maintain data
quality that's your product is the data
itself Because the actual software part
of that is managed by a no code tool you
don't need to go make updates you don't
have to add functionality that it's not
your business your data business
maintain good B business on or maintain
good data and Market it that's it and
like data as much as Apollo or Zoom info
or any of these people want you to
believe like data is so commoditized

[38:01]
believe like data is so commoditized
like you just pop on upw work and I
promise for like
$200 you could get the data list of
really anything you Millions like
literally whatever you could be like I
want every single roofing business in in
Texas and like yep I'd be like all right
go to D7 LEF finder.com and get it for
100 bucks bro like it's not hard to get
that data and so it's just putting a
wrapper around it and I think that
there's
opportunities for very Niche specific
database businesses to grow again like
are they going to go compete with zoom
info from a billion dollar valuation
perspective no do I think you could go
make half a million dollars a year on it
yeah all right I just got an idea that
gave me an idea a more specific idea
with your framework so cyber leads they
charge 200 bucks a month and what's
special about them is they're companies
that recently raised money yes really
tech companies that recently raise money
and Nick and I talked this on about this

[39:01]
and Nick and I talked this on about this
on holdco Bros of like find a service
that you can sell to those companies
because they are just so eager to spend
money ready to go right that just raised
yeah which is why cyber leads works okay
right so what about cyber leads for home
service business owner cell phone
numbers High sorry High ticket home
service American business owner cell
phone names and numbers Okay so you
scrape all the roofers scrub out all the
landlines okay scrape out all the stck
companies anything that costs thousands
of dollars fencing companies painting
companies contractors whatever you only
want the business owner cell phone
numbers every week you get a new CSV in
your inbox fresh leads and it's for
agency owners because as an agency owner
you don't freaking care if they're in
Portland OR Portland Main or Portland
Oregon it doesn't matter right but you
want to talk to the owner you want the
decision maker
what do you think yeah where do I sign
up it's like like for real though like

[40:02]
up it's like like for real though like
that's it is like you are doing the data
finding and cleaning on my behalf and I
should pay you to do that because it's
valuable right it's like and you it's it
goes back to kind of the what we're
talking about before we started
recording it's like you just built a
better system that allows for you to go
and do that better than I could do on my
own I don't want to pay you $5,000 a
month for those leads but I definitely
will pay you $300 a month for those
leads like there's that middle ground
it's funny it's like in the unlimited
content Manifesto that I was talking
about it's like that's what it is like
people I have this macro business thesis
about
where specifically the service and like
Tech bootstrap world ends
up and what I really think it's like the
old agency model is
broken because of the commoditization of
all of these tools right like you can go
as a consumer or business owner go sign

[41:01]
as a consumer or business owner go sign
up for semrush you can go sign up for D7
lead finder you can go you can very
easily go do all that and the market is
educated enough to know that they can
right like I open up a semrush dashboard
to do a site audit for somebody they've
already seen it they have a semrush
account right like but that the tools
doesn't solve the problem what is the
8020 of the lift right and in your case
in that idea it's the sourcing and
cleaning of that data right your product
is that you cleaned it and that they
don't have to clean it themselves it's
done for them like we cleaned it you
still have to call them but we cleaned
it we did the hard part of
it and because we leveraged technology
to do that it didn't cost us that much
to do so we can pass those savings along
to you while we still do it for you and
so it's like again
affordable
transparent done for you and effective
if those couple things can be achieved
by a

[42:00]
by a
business which they can now because
tools exist and offshore labor makes
things cheaper and if you're just
intentional around it that's perfect
it's a perfect idea and you could apply
that to any industry dude I'm going to
do this I really like this honestly you
should do it okay thanks for listening
to Sam and I Riff on some business ideas
we'll have him on again soon and we will
see you next time
