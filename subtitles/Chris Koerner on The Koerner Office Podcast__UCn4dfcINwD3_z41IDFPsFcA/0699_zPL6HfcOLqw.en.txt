do you see my tweet about building a pickle
ball club i've spent $200 in ads that's the
whole club that's it i'm full anyone could do
this like anyone that lives in an area where
people have a metal building in their backyard
that's not being utilized you could go rent it
from them you can make 100 grand a month off of
this easily i talked to this guy and he's like I
do bathtub refinishing and I was like what he's
got one or two employees that do the majority of
the work he's making anywhere between two and
$500,000 a year bathtub refinishing is like
the perfect business to start in any market is
a gonna come and refinish your bathtub like no
do you see my tweet about building a pickle ball
club a secret pickle ball club i did i did okay
so I've been using Facebook ads to generate leads
and or pre-orders for this pickle ball club okay
and I've talked about this a little bit on the
pod so I won't go into deep detail but the whole
business model is this 99 bucks a month reserve
a court play doubles or singles with two you know

[01:01]
one or three other people for 99 bucks a month
you're guaranteed the ability to play x times
per month and then you can pay extra to play more
times per month but I have no idea yet if people
want to play 30 times a month three times a month
will they even pay a hundred right a lot of the
people on the comments on Twitter were like "No
one wants to go to a pickleball club if they can't
be seen by other people playing pickle ball." I'm
like "Dude nobody wants to be seen playing pickle
ball where have you been?" Like are you kidding
me this isn't a gym you know it's not a flex it's
never been a flex in fact it might be quite the
feature for no one to see you playing pickle ball
especially if you're a beginner dude we've all
been there your wife walks in on you late at night
11:00 at night practicing your pickle ball grip
and she's like she comes "What are you doing?"
And you quickly I don't think any of I don't think
I've been there Nick you quickly put the paddle on
you're like "Having an affair." You don't want her
to think that you're playing pickle ball i get it

[02:00]
oh that was my favorite comment this doesn't work
cuz most of these pickle ball clubs have 15 courts
and they want to be seen by other people playing
what the freak are they talking about but maybe
he's right right i wanted to know before I go get
my septic system fixed and expand my building i
wanted to know so I'm going to share my screen and
I'm going to show exactly what I did to generate
these leads okay oh wow okay all right can you see
my screen right now i can yes all right so I'm in
Meta Ads Manager right now and if you can just
see the radius this is the location of the shop
plus six miles and I chose six because I didn't
want to go all the way over here or up here it's
hard to describe but I just kind of know where
everyone lives in this area six miles was perfect
for me cool and so Facebook says "Okay oh there's
174,000 to 205,000 people within that radius."
And honestly I had already done this math myself
and I got 220,000 so it's like extremely close

[03:00]
okay you're an amazing estimator i've always said
that thank you very much yes you have and then I
said "You know what use your AI to show it to the
people in that radius that you think want to see
it so I didn't say "Show it to people that follow
me show it to people that interact with my stuff
show it to pickleball players show it to boomers."
I didn't say any of that show it to whoever you
want as long as they live here because they do
have to live there okay does that cost more or
less than you just telling it exactly what you
want it to show or mean it's meange sorry that was
Hungarian i'm sorry for our audience who didn't
who didn't know what that meant well it makes no
difference okay if there is a difference I don't
know what it is so then I tried multiple types
of ads i did the same video but I tried instant
form where you get their name email and phone all
within the Facebook ecosystem and then I just did
a link to a type form and then I did instant form
that forwarded to the type form afterwards and the
third one one is like the best bang for your buck

[04:00]
is I capture their name and their email before
I get anything else and then I autodirect them
to really share yep i'm going to share this type
form was there ad copy like what was the ad that
you were showing them i'll go back to the ad copy
and show you that even before the ad copy why did
you decide to go to Facebook like why not go to
Perplexity and do some research how is this better
than going to say a deep research LLM i mean
that's just all hypothetical right like I wanted
real people in this area to tell me would they pay
for this most importantly how often do they want
to play what time of day do they want to play do
they do play in doubles or singles because those
are all very relevant if everyone plays singles
then I can only have half as many members if they
all play doubles I can have twice as many members
if they all want to play 30 times a month then I
can only have 50 members if they I want to play 10
times a month I can have 200 members you know but
right now all of this is just hypothetical chad
GPT got me there right so to your point it got me

[05:00]
to here but I don't know if real people actually
desire those things yet yeah so like going to do
deep research or perplexity that's static data
that's that they can anybody can go access this
is dynamic data this is like real time whether or
not people want to use it how much they'll pay etc
yeah all right so here's what the ad is and this
is one of three variations that are all pretty
similar sh secret pickup ball opens on July 30th
we're capping the memberships 24/7 key card access
reserve a court when you need a court one private
court lounge vending machines bathroom shower all
close to home allan Lucas Fairview Murphy Parker
WY become a founding member here so I edited that
myself obviously because I didn't want to wait for
my editors to do it and so it's like there's a I
could have put like an overlay of what it looks
like that's a I could have done so much more
but even with all that what amazing ad thank
you like just the way you painted it scarcity
it's secret so it feels exclusive like you're
whispering like even though I could just turn my
AirPods up it's like I'm leaning in like whoa wait
what what's going on just Oh gosh it was so good

[06:03]
thank you thank you i named the cities right so
they know this is because those are small cities
that I named they know this is personal to me
right here are my results so far 74 leads $2.64
per lead okay okay so you've spent 150 bucks i've
spent 200 bucks to get 74 leads but it gets better
and so here's how this works i make you free
videos i actually know what I'm talking about
i have no greasy sales pitch at the end and if you
implement what I talk about you'll make a lot more
money and have a better life and all I ask for in
return is that you hit the subscribe button and
maybe even the notification bell just like that
thank you what you're seeing here you see how
there are these line breaks with no data so these
line breaks with no data are people that filled
out the Facebook instant form and I got their
name and phone but then they didn't go to the
type form and so the people that did give me all
this info they're usually on the row right next to
the person that I got their instant form data and
their type form data and it's a 19 question type

[07:05]
form like wow I'll share my type forms what was
in the questions so this is the intro one prompt
ai generated ugly logo this is the concept here's
what it looks like 99 bucks a month boom how can
we reach you name and phone what's your t-shirt
size so I put that in the beginning so they can
see like oh I'm going to get something free yeah
I want to keep going on this form i get something
free you know what is your pickleball skill level
this is like how pickle ball players are rated and
I didn't know that till I asked JGBT so I just
pasted those in how many times do you currently
play per month how many times do you plan to
play per month because I'm assuming they're
going to want to play more than they do now if
it's convenient and nearby how long do you play
for what time of the day will you prefer to play
that's very important yeah you play doubles or
singles would you pay $99 a month for everything
described yes no other how many friends do you
have that may be interested in joining because
doubles that could be three other people right
would you be interested in an ambassador program
where we'd reward you for bringing friends on as

[08:02]
members which I'm not going to do because the
demand has been so good there'd be no no what's
the point i have a fixed supply right so I'm not
going to give out discounts and then is there
anything we should change about pricing and I got
some really good data here like man this other
club charges 15 bucks per or maybe I want to bring
a guest but he's not a member can he just pay 10
bucks like really really good data what else would
you like this pickupball club to have people were
like "Oh I'd like a room to practice my dinks."
Or "There's this $2,000 machine that will serve
to me i'd like to practice by myself." Like I
didn't know any of these things jeez and then I
put on a scale of 1 to 10 if this club has all the
features I described how likely are you to become
a founding member at $99 a month 10 equals take my
money and one equals get lost and then any other
questions so then if you go look at the results so
it's it's very interesting go ahead so were the 75
leads people who 75 people who filled out the 19
question type form or was it even those people

[09:00]
who gave their name and number but didn't fill out
the type form does that make sense what I'm asking
yeah so 74 people filled out the instant form
and I got their name and number and then 55 or
42 people filled out the type form so over half
did both okay before I color it with my opinion
if I'm listening to this and I hear you say "I
did this quiz i got all this information and 55
people answered me or filled out 19 questions."
I might think that that's not a lot of people
yeah how do you feel about the response to this
survey dude think of it this way let's say that
the average member brings one other member and
by nature of this it's not like a gym you don't
need to bring them a friend to a gym most people
don't right with this you can't play by yourself
so let's just say conservatively every person
brings another person so that's $200 a month
from one person right because they have to all be
members if they're playing doubles or singles mh
let's say they stay for a year maybe it's two
months maybe it's 10 years i don't know let's

[10:04]
say a year it's $2,400 LTV lifetime value of each
person okay i just spent Oh now let's go to this
column P 110 scale how likely are you to join
10 9 888 777 like these are high intent people
and then over here would you pay yes yes yes yes
yes yes yes like I'm asking them multiple times
number of friends would you bring 1 to two four
to six seven plus four to six four to six like
they could be bringing four on average so it's
like $2,400 lifetime value and I've spent $200 in
ads to potentially sell out the whole club right
dude I'm so glad you answered it that way cuz like
anybody listening you hit the nail on the head
it's not necessarily the total number of people
that responded it's the number of quality people
that responded to have 50 plus people who filled
out 19 questions and probably the average rating
of how interested they are let's just say is it

[11:02]
eight or seven and a half that's the whole club
like you you just launched a business yeah you're
full off of half of those people potentially right
like it's it's such good data for you because it
was such a small geographic market it was such
a niche number of people demographic like this
response kind of blows my mind to be honest it's
crazy and like this would my costs on this would
be insurance a cleaner some tech Wi-Fi utilities
there's there's probably 30 to $40,000 upfront but
if I'm sold out that's 20 grand a month topline
maybe 16 grand a month bottom line like what are
we talking for for $200 in ads yeah oh let me call
hey Warren yeah Warren is that a good investment
or a bad investment okay it's good okay yeah
warren Buffett says that's a good investment yeah
so like it's incredible it just it's incredible
and anyone could do this like anyone that lives
in an area where people have a metal building
in their backyard that's not being utilized you

[12:04]
could go rent it from them like rent it this isn't
commercial i don't need commercial i want to paint
lines on your floor and post Facebook ads well
dude can I pivot just a little bit but kind of
stay on or you you have more okay so my wife's
been playing a ton of tennis for the last year
which is actually pretty cool i got more for you
about this okay okay she joined the USA which is
the US Tennis Association she's playing she's
rated nationally which is like a self-reported
rating system i'm I'm assuming it's very similar
to what pickle ball is but here in Boise they
have these teams and you you pay to join the teams
there's somebody who organizes it they play once
a week and then at the end of these seasons they
then have tournaments and so they'll play locally
the winner of that goes to divisions sectionals
I don't know and then the winners of that go to
regionals and then the winners of that go to
nationals because it's the USA it's all around
the country and so we went to Pocutello this
weekend because she they won in Boise they went

[13:00]
to Pocutello my wife's out there with a freaking
stress fracture she won all three of her matches
cuz she's a freaking beast but they won and so now
they're going to go to regionals and if they win
that they'll go to nationals i'm sure that there's
something like this within pickle ball we talked
about my brother-in-law who wants to launch this
company it's called Porter Courts and their whole
idea is portable pickleball courts so you can go
and play and you can arrange tournaments yada yada
yada i think there's something there even with
this idea that you have that you can copy from
the USA where it's like okay in Dallas you could
organize tournaments you could have a tournament
at your house or your your house could be like in
the NCAA tournament it's just one of the regions
that people play into as they're going to the
finals do you know what I Like you could find
probably 20 other pickle ball owners and create
your own Sweet 16 tournament and have people play
into it at each one of those locations and then
the winners go to a predetermined location which
everybody likes or something like that but I just
I like this idea of piggybacking off of what the
USA's already built and just copying it and just
be like "Oh yeah we'll do that except for pickle

[14:02]
ball because it's a proven model." And now that
you have a pickleball court in your backyard yes
you can have the club but you can also kind
of expand it by creating a league or creating
these teams dude endless options yeah be freaking
amazing vend vending machines you could do private
lessons you could you could find pickleball tutors
and like take a margin between them and them you
could match them up but what I was thinking about
you Nick you've got a freaking covered pickleball
court in your backyard what's preventing you from
doing this and a tennis court her name is Beep i
beeped out my wife's name for those of you she
doesn't have to know she doesn't listen to this
podcast anyway just random people showing up in
the backyard she's like "What is happening here
why are they here?" Like "Don't worry about it
they've won me $5." Or you could do you could rent
it out for private basketball lessons get private
basketball tutors and youths that's a big business

[15:01]
right now dude that's right well I have some sad
news i think the bubble's coming down you just
burst my bubble dude you're so stupid what you I'm
really not going to drop that right there okay but
in all in all seriousness these people don't have
to pay for it but we've been having clinics at
my house so my wife and some other ladies in the
community will come to our house we have a tennis
court and they have an instructor who comes they
pay the instructor and he hosts there he doesn't
pay us anything we don't charge him anything we
probably should charge him something for hosting
but it is kind of cool to have a spot where people
can come and congregate and that's how I like your
pickleball court I think would be something very
similar to that well dude here's another idea for
you you know what Swimply is have you heard of
Swimply no it's like the It's the dumbest name
ever it's Airbnb for pools where if you have a
pool you can list it on Swimply and people can
come book it for an hour or 10 hours and there are
people that make six figures net profit per year
just renting out their pool or people Yeah I swear
people will rent a house like let's say you're in

[16:04]
Gilbert Arizona you rent a house that has a pool
$3,000 a month and that house sits empty and you
just rent out the pool on Swimply that's it that's
the whole business let me ask you a question how
much you think this pool will rent out for on
Swimply $1,000 a second was that too bullish
that's a little That was a little bullish oh my
gosh this is our back this is our backyard look
at that pool dude oh my gosh i'm going to listen
swim today no but anyway I didn't even get to the
idea the idea would be to build like a swim for
pickleball courts cuz people are building sport
courts like crazy like would you rather build a
pool for 150 grand or a sport court for 30 grand
in Texas people are building sport courts like
crazy that's Owen's idea that's porter courts no
no no no no i I know but this is like people that
had a sport court with pickle ball on it in their
backyard could list their property on this website
and rent it out to other people like other pickle

[17:01]
ball players with pickle odds for Facebook i
have a brother-in-law Owen love him to death
so video is cool but you know what's better
long form audio via podcast and my newsletter
tkopod.com go there to subscribe for free to my
newsletter it's one email a week very tactical
and then go to my audio podcast three episodes
a week stuff like this you're going to love it
all free no sleazy sales [ __ ] tkopod.com people
are building sport courts like crazy like would
you rather build a pool for 150 grand or a sport
court for 30 grand in Texas people are building
sport courts like crazy that's no one's idea
that's porter courts no no no no no no i I know
but this is like people that had a sport court
with pickle ball on it in their backyard could
list their property on this website and rent
it out to other people like other pickle ball
players with pickle ball ads or Facebook i have
a brother-in-law Owen love him to death and he
had this idea to start a portable pickle the app
side of the idea yeah and he like built out the
whole app right because And the whole app is like
a community of people and they can put on courts
online and they can get together and and like I'm
looking at this and I was like "Geez Louise this

[18:04]
is overbuilt." But that's effectively his idea
he's already built like he's literally already
built the ecosystem for it where you can go and
say "Oh this court's ready for us to go and rent
or or just show up to and play at let's all go and
you coordinate and communicate with your friends."
Now I think you could do it with an AI rapper but
he's actually built out the the whole entire app
but I agree i think it's a great idea they have
these AI tools now that uses Google Earth to
identify certain homes like if let's say you had a
solar company you could go identify the homes that
have like max sun exposure on the roof you could
use a tool like that to find all the homes with
sport courts and you could proactively list them
on this marketplace and then as they start to get
inquiries then you could use that as the reason to
reach out to the homeowner and say "Hey we listed
your uh your sport court on this marketplace."
We blurt out your address for your privacy but
if you ever want free money go ahead and verify
your listing it's kind of like a Google business
profile how Google will automatically add all the
businesses and then the owner has to go and verify

[19:02]
it it could be the same interesting any risk of
Google kicking you off for like listing places
that aren't yours no I wouldn't you wouldn't have
anything to do with Google it would just be on
your website oh yeah dude I love that idea can I
share an idea do it so we moved a couple of weeks
ago and uh this is my backyard i posted this on
Twitter actually it's freaking amazing go i went
from.3 acres to 3 acres and I'm going to stand by
what I said it is harder it's harder doing that
than going from two to three kids for me all right
but this is the backyard it's amazing and you know
me I'm a city boy like I'm not mowing this whole
thing now i got to weed i'm not going to You're
not doing any of it actually technically speaking
actually that is correct i have this company named
Augusta Lawn Care Services i don't remember
their exact name if you ever want to come on to
the podcast let's let's have a conversation they
take care of my yard but the point is one of the
reasons that we bought this house was because we
wanted to have a house where we could host people

[20:00]
like you have a house where you can host people
and it's beautiful you got a big backyard you got
a big house you love cooking for people and I've
been jealous of that right like like we lived in
a smaller house it wasn't it was nice but it's not
like we could have a bunch of people over and so
we moved from from a third of an acre to now three
acres and in the first couple weeks that we've
been here we've had my second son's soccer party
and my oldest son's volleyball party at the house
and they swam in in this pool back here and it was
amazing dude like good conversations the families
were there the kids were excited my house was
amazing on the inside like it didn't get dirty at
all cuz nobody went inside they were just outside
playing the whole entire time which is freaking
awesome but as I was talking to people out here
and having a conversation around this beautiful
pool I talked to this guy and I find out he's an
entrepreneur and I'm like "Oh cool tell me about
your business." He's like "Oh well I do bathtub
refinishing." And I was like "What?" He's like
"Yeah yeah bathtub refinishing." And I was like
"That's a that's a thing." He's like "Yeah yeah
that's a thing." I was like "Oh what is that?"
He's like "Well you know if you have these if

[21:03]
you have an acrylic path bathtub or if you have a
stainless steel bathtub or whatever it is they all
have a surface and it might get chipped and it or
it might get rubbed the wrong way whatever it is."
And to replace those is like 15,000 10 $15,000
but to just get it refinished is like $6 to $900
and lots of people don't necessarily realize you
can just get it refinished as opposed to having to
buy a whole new bathtub or like have to actually
redo your whole bathroom you know what I mean it's
like it gets really expensive and obviously
having that conversation with him was like
"But tell me more." First of all we just started
talking about his specific business before I get
into that though did you know that's a thing i'd
heard of it yeah i've seen like short form videos
of like the before and after really but I don't
know anything about it yeah okay so this guy was
talking about his business he started this like
5 years ago and he's got like the quintessential
dream entrepreneur lifestyle right he's got this
business he's got one or two employees that do
the majority of the work if I were to guess
he's probably making anywhere between $2 and

[22:04]
$500,000 a year so he's like content with where he
is he's making great money and but he's also not
like he could scale if he wanted he could scale
exactly he's not like "Well I got to I got to
triple quadruple the size of this business." And
he picked a business that is like so niche and
not sexy not a ton of people are entering it and
on top of that is AI going to disrupt this space
is AI going to come and refinish your bathtub like
no it's not going to come finish your bathtub so
average ticket price $600 to $900 margin on that
is like 30% net margins obviously if you get an
employee that it brings down your net margins
but I want you to check this out okay this is
the Treasure Valley so where I live and there are
about 800,000 people that live in this area i just
searched bathtub refinishing Boise Idaho look how
many competitors there are there's 800,000 people
that live here probably somewhere in the order of
like 250,000 homes 250,000 to like 400,000 homes

[23:03]
and there are like maybe six like this Jacuzzi
bathtub remodel they're not doing refinishing
this new finish is definitely competitor refinish
is a competitor boise bathtub refinishing this is
This is the guy who came to my Name checks out
yep that's him that's That's the guy who came to
my uh my my son's volleyball team party miracle
finishing let's see what this one is bath Crest
no that's not a refinisher that's just a remodeler
and then we finished Nampa so we're talking about
five or six actual competitors in a market that's
freaking massive and I started talking to him like
"How do you acquire customers?" It's like "Well
Google." And he's like SEO he's not doing any
real paid ads he's tried to use other agencies
in the past but he's like "It just doesn't work
like I just I'm not getting the type of business
that I want to out of out of actually paying the
money to do that the best form of leads right now
is Google SEO that's all that's where I get like
all of my leads from and I think I know this
isn't sexy i know this isn't AI this to me is

[24:03]
like hey you want to start a pressure washing
company hey you want to start window washing
bathtub refinishing is like the perfect sweaty
non sexy business to start in any market think
about how old the homes are in any market an aging
population people don't want to pay a ton of money
to have it like totally remodeled $10 to $15,000
$600 to $900 is a way more affordable price
point i just think that this would be an awesome
opportunity for any enterprising person who wants
to get into home services yeah or you could build
up like a lead genen site a programmatic site and
just sell these leads to these guys that's a
great Dude that's a freaking great idea oh my
gosh that's a great idea someone's going to be
doing it now that we talked about it how easy
would it be yeah all day actually this would
be a perfect directory yeah be great for that
too right could easily spin up a directory so
hot right now directories are so MCP directory
claude we just start we're just throwing the
words out now you now with MCP yeah you know me

[25:04]
that was a real world business model that I
just think is I like it could be really cool
that's good we've kind of talked about this idea
before but I'm kind of falling more in love with
it especially with AI i think you can build
an easy wrapper around it and you my friend
you in particular I'm not talking about anybody
else nobody listening screw the listener you you
can make 100 grand a month off of this easily
people struggle with staying consistent true
or false 100% what's the biggest problem with
staying consistent it's hard and it is hard in
my experience In my experience it's accountability
like there's no accountability loop that they've
set up for themselves if you say "I'm going to
go to the gym tomorrow," and you wake up at 6 a.m
how easy is it to hit snooze versus if I say "I'm
going to the gym tomorrow and I'm picking you up
at 6 a.m." Which one of those it's night and day
right there's actually somebody who's going to be
there they're going to hold you accountable
and they're going to follow up with you

[26:00]
i think there's a huge opportunity utilizing
AI to have an accountability partner app but
it's not just an accountability partner app
that pushes notifications like "Hey did you
check in today hey did you do X Y and Z today?"
It's an app that actually gets to know you and
has conversations with you so you told me this a
long time ago i didn't even know this was a thing
you can it's it's green bubbles but you can you
can set up notifications to come to you through
an API in a in a text so you could actually text
with chatbt if you wanted to you don't have to
go to their interface you could just like go
to their phone number and text them and then
there's an API call that you have to pay for so
I would set it up that way i would set it up so
that the interface is texting it's not necessarily
an app it's like oh this is a friend of mine who's
asking me but in order to get started you've
got to do this like comprehensive checklist
we talked we've talked about quizzes before
i freaking love quizzes so it's comprehensive
checklist who you are what motivates you what
do you struggle with how how do you like to
be talked to please upload seven emails it just
gets to know you your humor whatever and then it

[27:02]
creates a custom chatbot that even if it's just
uploaded to a single prompt that can interface
with you and at least give you some tailored
encouragement and guidance so let me hit some
stats to tell you what kind of market opportunity
this is the wellness and productivity app market
does that sound niche to you it does but I know
productivity is big business i know i know but
it's like if I if I told you "Oh yeah i've got a
business that we built a wellness and productivity
app." You'd be like "I'm sorry i fell asleep
halfway through that sentence." What is it yeah
yeah it's an $8 billion market eight with a just
get 1% bro I'm just telling you bro if we could
do 1% of 1% that's $8 million bro okay so that's
number one number two what do people love about
the self-help market about the productivity market
they love coaches they want to have a friend a
familiar face so you don't just want a normal AI
do you you want a friendly AI you want a TKO AI

[28:02]
you want a Coler Office who's going to be who's
you want a Ker Office who's going to be like "Hey
did you get your cookie in the cookie jar?" Okay
did you get bit by that gay guy oh gosh we'll see
we'll see you know what I'm saying but it's
going to be somebody that they that they know
that they're familiar with that is like showing up
to hold them accountable there's this AI coach on
this product called Replica apparently there's
over 10 million active users right now and it
honestly kind of looks janky sorry Replica if
you're listening but I think that you could
pretty easily even if you weren't starting a
new company just build a rapper for yourself
of reminders check-ins with a familiar chatbot
that knows you well that would hold you more
accountable and have you achieve your goals much
easier and I think somebody like you or somebody
who has a large audience could brand it as the
Chris Kerner accountability partner and boom
you've got a really easy app that holds people
accountable because really the main thrust of

[29:00]
the app is accountability it's not Chris Kerner's
personality it just so happens that it has part of
Chris Krishn's personality what do you think
i love it yeah it's a no-brainer i've talked
about a similar idea on this pod before a couple
months ago the only worry that I have for it is
like are there any stakes to that right like if
you're showing up to my house to take me to the
gym there are real stakes there i don't want to
let you down but are there really stakes to an
AI app like bugging you or is it just e as easy
to ignore as it is easy to ignore an alarm clock
going off so if I were to look at it and say the
percentage of people who stick with their routine
from an in-person conversation versus this I think
the in-person interaction is going to be higher
i just think that's the way that we are period
but I think that this would be higher than no
interaction at all so if you had no interaction
versus this AI interaction I think this AI
interaction is going to be better i do think the
outcomes will be better but beyond that that's why

[30:02]
I think branding it with like a personality and
the delivery mechanism being a text and not an app
it just feels more personal if I get a text even
if it's like oh your school is letting you know
your son got out early today like it pisses me
off cuz I'm like why do they have my phone number
whereas if that was in an app that I had to go to
and actually look at I'm not going to be pissed
off right i just think a text is more personalized
and then having your personality around it would
allow for better accountability it's true you
could even work in like some AI calling too have
a conversation super interesting where it's like
"Oh you missed your call today." And there's like
some real stakes attached to it like maybe you
have their maybe you charge their card every time
they miss a call they have to pay for it somehow
maybe maybe it's a free app but they only pay for
it when they don't do what they're supposed to do
and so it's it's like it's a 100% free lifetime
for everyone that does what they're supposed to
do this is a tangent it's related but totally
different why aren't personal trainers and coaches
using AI more in their business it seems like that

[31:03]
would be the perfect okay here's the app log all
of your information log everything that you're
doing and then for the coach they don't have to
spend the time necessarily reading all of that log
they just ask AI to tell them what they need to
follow up with on their client and they're saving
like an hour or more a week per client giving
them better solutions more tailored solutions
feels like there is an opportunity even there to
use AI you could just use an a wrapper like build
a simple wrapper that is chat GPT but for personal
trainers that they pay for every month to make
their their lives easier the offer could be like
save an hour per week per client with this $10 a
month app well and this was a continuation of the
other idea but you could build this internally you
could have an internal accountability mechanism
for your company right where it's like "Okay
cool." And then the chatbot notifies everybody 24
hours after a meeting happened or it it's set to
notify you Chris of a deadline that you agreed
to on a previous call 48 hours 24 hours a week

[32:05]
like you could have hey notify Chris that this
is due a week in advance 2 days in advance and
24 hours in advance you know what I mean so it's
not this like race at the last minute to kind of
put something together i love it okay he loves
it he's speechless that's good should we wrap it
that's a rat should we wrap it sorry oh well so
good this a protein bar h so good
i love it all right what' you think
