my friend Mitchell here owns an ATM
Empire that profits him
$864,000 a year but he didn't start off
big he started in his garage with three
ATMs here's how anyone watching this
could copy what he's done Mitchell was
looking to buy a business but he wanted
to buy something that didn't have very
many employees and that sold for two to
four times yearly profit then he found
the ATM business ATM businesses sell for
about three times annual profit which is
the same as like an electrical company
with 90% less employees are headache he
found a listing that had 400 ATM
machines for sale which was way too much
for him so we asked the seller something
that sellers usually say no to hey can I
just buy three of these the seller
agreed he paid 36 grand for three of
them and within 6 weeks he had raised
fees and was making $11,000 a month in
net profit then he went back to the
seller and said let me get 20 more then
he went back and said let me get 40 more
and today he's running a network of 900
ATMs and makes 864 Grand a year in
profit full interview here
