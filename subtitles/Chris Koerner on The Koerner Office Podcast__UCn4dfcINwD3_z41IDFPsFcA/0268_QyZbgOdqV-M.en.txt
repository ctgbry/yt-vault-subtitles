you guys have to see what I found so
we've all seen the Big Texas
neighborhoods but how many of them are
almost fully surrounded by a river with
their own Marina and own Lake plus all
these amenities and one amenity here
that just blows my mind that I'll get to
at the end it's got tens of thousands of
pecan trees that have been there for
decades it's got $500,000 starter homes
and $1.5 million homes and everything in
between but what blows my mind is that
it has two freaking air strips what
could be more rad than an airport with
two air strips in it oh your
neighborhood has a pool yeah mine has an
airport and their HOA is like 200 bucks
a month it's not far from Dallas Texas
no state income taxes it's basically a
whole city all right there within the
neighborhood and you can buy a lot
that's connected directly to the runway
or the taxi way for about 170 Grand
Don't Mess with Texas but come stay a
while here's the info it's called Pecan
Plantation I think they only have a few
Lots left that have access to the runway
