I did door to-door sales for two years
and here's a dirty little secret we hate
doing it just as much as you hate seeing
us so here are my five hacks for getting
us off your doorstep number one I'm just
renting I don't own this place I can't
make these decisions number two oh my
brother owns a PES control company
number three oh I'm moving tomorrow so
sorry number four I already have solar
and then when they go look on your roof
you just lock the door and number five
say one more word and I'll murder you
follow me for more life hacks like this
