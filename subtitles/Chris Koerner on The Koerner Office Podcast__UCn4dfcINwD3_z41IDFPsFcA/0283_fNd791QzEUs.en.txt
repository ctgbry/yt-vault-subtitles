welcome to the ker office I had a friend
named Johnny Robinson on the Pod today
Johnny is known for starting a window
washing company in Orange County that
did Super well to this day it ranks
number one in the map pack for window
washing in Orange County he sold it
years ago now he's known for teaching
people how to start a home cleaning
business with little to no money he's
really good at it he's might be one of
the most knowledgeable people on the
planet when it comes to starting a home
cleaning business so I think you like
this episode he didn't pull any punches
he talked about all the hard and nasty
ugly parts of the business and then he
talked about the good parts of the
business and why it's a pretty good
business to be in his opinion you can
decide for yourself he told some really
interesting stories about how they vet
cleaners because that's the hardest part
of this business is finding a good
cleaner because if you have find a good
cleaner then you've got a good business
and the opposite is also true he's got
some growth hacks for that he also
talked about opportunities he's seeing
tangential to the industry that you
could capitalize on if you don't want to
start a cleaning business poxy flooring
for instance he says is booming right
now and I think you'll be able to learn
from this this is a business that one

[01:00]
from this this is a business that one
could start it's a huge industry lots of
room for all competition I hope you
enjoy this episode and please like And
subscribe and leave me a review if you
like it don't leave me a review if you
don't just kidding but seriously love
you
[Music]
bye okay well Johnny thanks for joining
why don't you tell us who you are and
what you do yeah so my name's Johnny I
run a company called Home Service
Academy we teach people how to start
house cleaning businesses and run them
remotely so some a lot of your listeners
have probably seen the all the cleaning
bros I would imagine a lot are on
Twitter so so I'd like to think that I
started the wave of cleaning businesses
I'm the Unk of cleaning Twitter the
uncle of cleaning Twitter and yeah I got
my start when I was 19 years old I'm 26
now I started the largest Window
Cleaning company in Orange County it's
still number one ranked on the map pack
on the first page of Google even over
Yelp built that up still own it today I
don't own it I sold it I built it up to
about nine full-time employees before I
switched to contractors and developed
this whole like remote cleaning model
then I started that same business for my
mom she's just single mom raised me on

[02:01]
mom she's just single mom raised me on
her own she was driving Uber in Orange
County with $3200 a month rent and I was
like okay well the window cleaning
business is doing all right but it's not
doing good enough to be like here Mom
here's 10 grand a month she's 64 years
old or 63 at the time and go retire you
don't have to work anymore I was like
but I can use my skill set that I've
learned building this window cleaning
business to do it in house cleaning and
house cleaning my kind of hypothesis was
well house cleaning is going to be much
easier because the availability of
contractors and labor is far greater
than window cleaning because you don't
need the waterfed poles and the
deionized water tanks and the trucks and
the ladders so we me and my business
partner Sergio we took out a new AMX
gold card and we said let's try to
replace my mom's and come and tweet
about it real quick was that the whole
plan all along like let's build this in
public let's document it this is going
to be a great story worst case best case
we've got a great business the whole
plan was knock out two birds with one
stone number one get my mom out of
driving Uber and number two make content
about it because I know if I made
content about it people would eat it up
and people were already asking me all

[03:00]
and people were already asking me all
over Twitter how can I because I was
tweeting about growing my following
about how I was running the window
cleaning business and people were like
how can I do it how can I do it but it
didn't feel right to teach them how to
do it because uh I like to think orange
window cleaning was a little anomaly
given the market and I wanted it if I
was going to sell something like that I
wanted it to be Mass market and be able
to start in any City and any Metro and
Window Cleaning you just couldn't do it
can we dive into that for a minute like
why was it an anomaly in Orange County
just because the contractor availability
like if you really wanted to grow the
business you were going to be Captain
you'd have to eventually go back to
employees right and so with Orange
County there's 3.2 million people that
live there window cleaning is very in
demand there's a ton out there there's a
ton that don't Market they don't know
how to sell there's a ton of contractors
you can hire for a window cleaning
business sure there's a lot of big
metros but there's also a lot of smaller
ones and so when people ask me hey how
can I do this how can I do this I wasn't
confident given their locations that
they would see success and so because of
that I was like okay well I need to
build credibility with his model in

[04:01]
build credibility with his model in
general by doing it again in house
cleaning then I was like okay well
people are going to ask me let me prove
it in house cleaning and I can knock I
could do the two birds with one stone
thing and help my mom out while growing
my following okay so basically if if I'm
understanding this correctly you didn't
feel comfortable teaching people how to
wash windows in their own markets
because you thought that ore County was
an outlier because it was so big there's
a lot of people a lot going on
unsophisticated operators whereas if
you're in let's say you're in um
Huntsville Alabama 200,000 people
couldn't the argument against that be
yeah you're gonna have a hard time
finding contractors but there's also
going to be a proportional same amount
of business out there it's a wash or is
that not the case a lot of problems with
home service companies and why they
can't grow is not so is never demand
because people are always going to need
their windows clean their house clean
you know refrigerators repair or not
refrigerators but air conditioner units
stuff like that problem with home
service companies is always Staffing MH
and a lot of times with the window
cleaners too is you're investing into
the waterfed poles the trucks maybe
you're getting your truck wrapped if
you're doing all that stuff you're not

[05:01]
you're doing all that stuff you're not
going to be willing to take the 50% or
40% that this referral agency it's the
official term of these businesses is
going to give you and so paired with
that and just my hunch of like I just
don't really feel comfortable I think
it's going to be a real challenge for
you to find contractors in labor and I
don't want you getting stuck in the
field clean the windows yourself or
having to feel like you need to go buy
the equipment to do it because you're
getting these leads I could be totally
wrong though I never actually tested it
it was just let me go do cleaning
instead it sounds logical to me I'm just
trying to take the contrarian side of it
cuz we're in Dallas and there's 8
million people here we don't really have
that hard of a time finding contractors
I I think what you're saying it's just a
bigger pool to draw from right like they
might have to drive from further away
because Orange County's pretty spread
out but you just have more options and
like let's say there's a 100 contractors
and a thousand businesses if you're top
5% of those businesses based on how you
treat your contractors and how you pay
them then you're in a better spot with

[06:01]
them then you're in a better spot with
more population because you're going to
be more likely to be able to recruit
them whereas if there's less people it
doesn't matter how good you are there's
just not enough people to recruit yeah
yeah yeah well also too from my
experience of hiring window cleaning
contractors need to check for the
equipment and the ladders and the water
bull stuff like that with cleaning
anybody can go to you know Home Depot
and pick up a some cleaning supplies and
go clean a house I can throw indeed
posting and have applicants flooded onto
my indeed profile with tons of potential
labor okay and so my thing was like okay
well the hiring bottleneck is going to
be solved way easier in cleaning than it
would for window cleaning because you're
probably doing a lot more manual
Outreach trying to get these people on
board to take jobs which is kind of a
sales process in a way if you can
utilize indeed then it kind of flips the
frame of hey now you have people coming
to you and wanting to work for your
company so that was my also my second
thought process was it just be easier to
hire on top of that okay so how did you
wrap up the window cleaning business
like how big did you grow it what did
you sell it for and how long did that

[07:01]
you sell it for and how long did that
whole process take this was during the
time where we had launched the cleaning
business we got my mom out of driving
Uber
then we pre-sold
$50,000 of Home Service Academy program
so we sold 15 uh programs at
$4,200 and for the first three months
this all ties in so for the first three
months we said let's just take this
money and let's sit on it let's not do
anything with it and let's make sure we
can get results and not sell anymore so
for the first three months that's what
we did we got results crush up for these
people in April we started selling again
and in April we started the runup from
considering I consider April zero I
consider like the 50k is like that was
like our seed money so from zero in
April to December we did 2.8 million of
Revenue with 1.5 of profit about Midway
through that point I was like I've never
seen this before this is like this is it
we got to go all in let's fire sell
orange window cleaning I want anything
to do with it anymore and we had one of

[08:01]
to do with it anymore and we had one of
our contractors who used to be an
employee for us but switched to
contractors he stayed on ah Hadad his
own truck his own equipment stuff like
that he's like dude I really want to buy
it I really want to buy it and so we're
like okay well we want to get this done
quick so we sold it for a little over
hundred grand he put about 50 down and
then seller noted the or financed the
rest over 12 months that was it and then
we went all in and he's still doing
great he's still doing it oh dude he's
crushing orange window cleaning does
over uh we got it to 65k a month our
best month was 70 but consistently about
65 and he's gotten it to over a million
dollars a year wow that just sounds like
the perfect win-win to me because you
kind of did firea it but you had this
shinier object and that played into your
decision- making right which benefited
him but you're fine because you're
moving on to something else he's
thrilled because he gets to seller or
Finance half of this business and he
knows the business he's drisk it just
seems like the perfect win-win to me
yeah I mean we still talk we're still
really great friends and he'll call me
here and there and we'll talk we'll chop

[09:00]
here and there and we'll talk we'll chop
it up about how he's doing and if you
look up window cleaning in Orange County
Orange window cleaning still shows up
number one so I take a lot of pride in
that yeah that's amazing such a huge
Market probably insanely competitive
too so all right so you got your mom out
of uber you made a little cash you
launched your home service Academy you
made a lot of cash from that and then
you started scaling that I'm curious
what
like from the perspective of a a house
cleaning remote business owner what are
like the headaches that they don't
foresee going into it because on on
Twitter on the surface it looks really
sexy passive right I'm sure you're not
telling people that but what are the
unknowns of this industry never say
passive I say it's far from passive
that's a four-letter word in my book
yeah it's anyone selling you passive
stuff saying passive automated it's a
scam it just it doesn't exist at least
in my experience if you want to show me
something that's passive and it's real
hey I'm open but I've never seen it but
yeah headaches hiring it's a staffing
business that's all it is it's just a
recruit roting Staffing business if you

[10:00]
recruit roting Staffing business if you
can do like if you can just be good at
that it solves the rest of your problems
82 yeah because your cleaners are your
product right your service based
business your cleaners are customer
facing if you do a good job at hiring
the cleaners and you good set good
expectations and they show up to your
customer house they're going to do a
better job you're going to get more five
star reviews which helps you rank higher
on the map pack and hopefully gets you
to the first page of Google you'll get
more referrals and you'll get more
customers that convert to recurring
clients which is where you actually make
your profit uh you know the the weeklys
bi-weekly monthlies and so the headache
is if you've never recruited well it can
be a pain in the ass especially when
you're talking to a bunch of house
cleaners all the time and you build up
your first big team of cleaners and then
all of a sudden some of them are coming
to you and they're going oh I want more
money or I don't want to take that job I
want this job I only want these jobs and
they get real picky and you can feel
like you're held hostage a little bit by
your cleaners because you need them to
go do the work you don't want to go do
the work and so I see a lot of that and
and the way you solve that is you just

[11:00]
and the way you solve that is you just
have to screen cleaners constantly it's
a hiring game and it's why most house
cleaning businesses get stuck and it's
why you can go and build a million to2
million doll house cleaning business in
any Market because no cleaning company
no your competition can't staff quick
enough to service all that demand so I
would say that's the biggest one and
then obviously it's a service business
so you have customers complaining about
the littlest things you're going to get
customers who complain about oh my gosh
this one little there's a dust particle
on my baseboard one dust particle come
back or I want to refund or I want money
off you know typical service business
stuff okay so I want to talk about this
because I started a cleaning business a
remote cleaning business like you know
what I I listened to your podcast of
your you're listenting all the
businesses and I heard you start that
one and you were like don't recommend I
see people talk I don't recommend it I
wanted to yeah well I did it the wrong
way clearly it works for lots of people
but his name was rohun I think have you
heard of him Rohan Gils that was the
system anyway I didn't do it right like
I was probably doing four other

[12:00]
I was probably doing four other
businesses at the time but I talk about
binary outcomes and this is my example
if you have a a tree removal business
it's like you show up you remove the
tree you get it out and you get a festar
review it's like very binary you win
it's past fail right whereas with this
business in my experience it was there's
a hair on my toilet there's this like
they were late they stayed too long like
oh they were like there were so many
little ticky tacky things that you could
screw up and they were all small when
you other things going on it's like what
am I doing why am I doing this yeah
right what am I doing here and so you
abandon it but if it was your only thing
you push through and you figure out
those stupid little things that really
every business has yeah I was going to
say it's like any business has its kind
of pains in the ass I can talk about you
know going back you said oh well your
shiny object kind of created this
win-win well my shiny object also
created a whole hell of a lot other
problems because I got punched in the
mouth in year or two trying to grow a a
course business if you make anything
your main FOC because you can make it
work and every business kind of has its

[13:01]
work and every business kind of has its
trade-offs and don't get me wrong
cleaning is no different it it does suck
at times but I will say too when you're
in the trenches and you're answering the
phone calls and you're dealing with the
customer complaints like that goes away
as you grow and as you scale because you
start to get your team to take all that
stuff for you all right if you are
watching this clip right now you are
watching this on YouTube and if you are
a fan of podcast please check out my
podcast while you're at it because
sometimes I have podcasts that aren't on
YouTube and sometimes I have YouTubes
that aren't on podcast so check out the
ker office on any podcast platform
platform or you can go to TKO pod.com
also my newsletter will throw that in
there there are no ads It's weekly it's
different content than my podcast and
YouTube newsletter. chrisj cerner.com
You'll see the link and we'll see you
there for us it really did come down to
the cleaners period like I could say it
revolved around really annoying
customers but they were just annoyed at
the cleaners so if we would have pushed
through and found better cleaners it
probably would have been great is indeed
like the 8020 for recruiting for you
like that's what 100% it's just the
quickest way if somebody comes in and
they've they've never built a business

[14:00]
they've they've never built a business
I'm like yeah they're like oh well I'm
checking out these like Facebook groups
for cleaners or I'm checking out next
door I just tell them just go to indeed
you'll make one post we've got the
templates just post print these words on
indeed and you'll get applicants and
then your job is to just 8020 that which
is 80% of the applic are G to suck and
20% will be good yeah is it a game of
just like higher three to fire two
higher three to fire two and you're
always filtering for the best people
basically yeah and you know the ones
that pass the screening 've got a year
of cleaning experience they've got their
own transportation they have their own
cleaning equipment you're going to want
to background check them and you're
going to want to send them to do a test
clean have you seen what the test clean
is on
Twitter so test clean it's a good way
because you're hiring contractors and
the risk there is that or at least a lot
of people coming into the business is
well what if they take my customers so
the way to prevent that and the way to
test character is to do what's called
the test clean what the test clean does
is the people you interview the ones
that you want to hire you send them to a
friend or family member's house
and this friend or family member knows

[15:01]
and this friend or family member knows
it's a test clean they're getting it for
free you say I'll clean your house for
free just I need you to ask one question
and to the cleaner this is a real job
like they don't know it's a test clean
oh okay like secet Shopper yeah exactly
and so the friend or family member asks
how can I book again and so when they
ask how can I book again it shows you
one of two things either they're going
to say hey I'm cheaper here's my card
call me I'll do it for cheaper or
they're going to say here call Chris's
office he'll get you rebooked now if
they say that really good green flag
pass they're probably good to send out
to jobs but that's assuming they did a
good job on the clean as well right
right it's one do they show up two do
they do a good job and three is asked
the question so then obviously if they
say here's my card I'll do it for
cheaper cut them get rid of them they're
going to try to seal your business
that's amazing that's amazing you
remember seeing those Cash for Gold
stores yeah I think I still see them in
Vegas they're still around but it's like
2017 2016
the price of gold was crazy and that was

[16:01]
the price of gold was crazy and that was
a whole industry that came and then left
in three years and so I had a friend
that owned a dozen Cash for Gold stores
around like rural Texas and Oklahoma and
he said like theft was a part of the job
like he just worked it into his numbers
and but he would send in friends to be
like secret shoppers with these gold
necklaces and then compare that against
because it was a 70% cash business M so
you could have cameras you can do this
you can do that but but he would always
like experience theft and it it's a much
part of a a broader framework for me of
the fact that like if you put an
employee in a tempting position they
could be the most honest person ever but
if they're hungry and poor like you can
incite them to steal from you is it your
fault no they're making that choice but
like you have to put them in an
opportunity to succeed or else you're
just going to be setting yourself up for
failure and so I thought that was
fascinating he would send people in to

[17:01]
fascinating he would send people in to
do tests just like you did with their
gold that's smart yeah smart because
sometimes like determining the
percentage of the gold is like you use a
tool but you could be like oh yeah this
is only 30% so we can only pay you this
ah okay and it's really like
90% so he would go in and check after
they clocked out if it was actual and
then they would pocket the difference
sometimes so slimy man a lot of shady
things
yeah yeah it's kind of like a mechanic
you know like oh they got all this stuff
wrong it's going to be too Grand and you
don't someone who doesn't know cars
going to get swindled yeah every time I
go to the the mechanic they charge me
200 bucks when my wife goes they charge
her 2,000 I don't know what it
is they do try to take advantage of my
wife though anyway so that's an amazing
story
so if they do a good job cleaning and
they show up and they don't try to steal
from you is that like an automatic hire
and they pass the background check yeah
yeah yeah I mean you'd be surprised like
so we had one of the first people to

[18:00]
so we had one of the first people to
come through Home Service Academy his
name is Cody he runs a company called
broom Bros in San Diego
and he was like I don't want to do test
clean I need to surface this job
background check hasn't come back yet so
I'm just going to send them right sends
a it's like a boyfriend girlfriend
Duo bad news and they show up to the job
and it's time to do the vacuuming on the
carpet and they didn't have a vacuum so
they didn't want to ask the customer
because they want to look bad so what
they did was they took out a broom their
broom and they started sweeping the
carpet makeshift vacuum and the customer
was there and the customer was there
they're like the customers texting Cody
and and his team and they're like hey
they're sweeping the
carpet obviously that's really
embarrassing and then come to find out
one of them had a criminal background so
it's like a good litmus test a test
clean is a non-negotiable then yes 100%
do you have any numbers or percentages
of how many try to Swindle you on that
test clean I would probably say it's
honestly around 50/50 wow yeah cuz they

[19:02]
honestly around 50/50 wow yeah cuz they
have no loyalty to you yet they just met
you they just met you yeah which is the
perfect time to do this test M 50% try
to go around you that's crazy when I
moved here to this apartment complex
there's a built-in valet right so you
valet you get your car valeted and then
you walk to your apartment whatever I I
come in it's my second day living here I
just moved and have a booking quality
t-shirt on which is the software all of
our clients use to run their cleaning
companies so I have this booking quality
t-shirt on I'm sitting waiting for my
car to be pulled up and I see this guy
looking at me I'm like dude what is this
guy looking at and I'm like you know
what's up man he's like dude are you
Johnny I'm like yeah I'm Johnny like how
do you know my name he goes dude I just
joined Home Service Academy three days
ago I said that's crazy no freaking way
man and so now I was anytime you need
test cleans I'll actually pay for them
you're my client so you you get the the
the luck of I'll pay for my own test
cleans you don't have to come out of
pocket for it so just send me all your
test cleans dude some of the these
people that show up it's it's like they

[20:01]
people that show up it's it's like they
they don't care they do not care so you
have him doing test cleans at your place
yes oh man do you just love it when they
try to go around you yeah that must be
so fun you shouldn't have said that yeah
like okay do you say anything to him no
oh jeez oh that's so funny any other
like Nightmare Horror stories that
you've come across in this business I
can tell you a personal one we see them
all the time dude like I just saw a
screenshot like two days ago in our
Mastermind chat where one of their
cleaners somehow stepped through the
sink and the whole sink detached their
cleaner stepped through the sink and the
whole sink detached and fell into the
onto the floor you see it all the time
but my personal and I have a ton but
this is by far the worst so we had a
crew of it was when we had employees
actually not contractors and we had
these two guys that we were already
questioning whether or not we should
keep them but we were in busy season and
so we kind of got stuck in that stupid
frame of mind of like well let's just
keep them and not fire him cuz we need

[21:00]
keep them and not fire him cuz we need
them which by the way will always screw
you I promise always SC 100% And so
we're like let's just keep them whatever
and this is probably
2019 and I get a call around 5:00 pm
from our like admin girl who was
actually us we weren't doing overseas
yet she goes hey you know these those
two guys they're done but the customer
is not happy and I okay we'll just send
them back just go fix whatever they're
not happy about and she's like oh no
they don't want them back and I go well
why not she goes they C those two guys
doing coke in the customer bathroom of
their like seven-year-old daughter's
bathroom when they inside the windows
doing coke and then he sent me a picture
of this little tray they were using and
it had all the
residue
so I mean when you're in a a people
business like you you just have stories
like these for days 100% yeah like I
said it's the service business man all
right so if indeed is the 8020 of hiring
what's the 8020 finding jobs like I know
like once you get traction you're going

[22:01]
like once you get traction you're going
to get referrals word of mouth but like
you got to drum up a bunch of jobs
really fast what do you do yeah I go
into any Facebook group mom groups Buy
and Sell Groups Community groups on
Facebook or next door this is what Mar
and aop my mom's business does this is
what we did with orange window cleaning
we had almost zero CAC because what we
would do is we'd go into these groups
we'd make a post introducing ourselves
hey I'm Johnny I live here in orange or
if I join a different city nearby I'd
say I live in y Belinda my favorite
restaurant is this I enjoy running at
this park whatever and I have I'm local
I'm a local I'm one of you I'm one of
you I'm one of you yep introducing
myself picture of myself you know good
nice niceo here's my baby pulled from
Google
Images I don't know about that one but
if you do have a baby born born
prematurely if you have a baby or a nice
like husband and wife or boyfriend
girlfriend professional photo it'll rip
and so what you do is you go in you make
this introduction post and uh depending
on the vibe of the group you either go
just straight introduction and subtly
mention you own the whatever company

[23:01]
mention you own the whatever company
cleaning business window cleaning
whatever you do and then you can either
comment you say just as a welcome to the
community I'm offering $50 off uh
anybody who comments clean or spring or
whatever it is right you could do that
it's a little risky you might get banned
or you just don't do that part and you
just introduce yourself and subtly
mention hey I own this cleaning company
then anybody that engages with that post
you take 10 to 20 of them and you you
message them real soft and you say hey
like I appreciate you with my post you
know even if they just like it you DM
them yep yep it's a warm lead yeah yeah
and so your job in this group to get
this going really quickly is to just get
one customer because once you get that
customer your job is to just do a really
good job for them and then as soon as
you're done you ask them for a review
back inside the group they found you in
I call it like the keeping up with the
Joneses effect because then when you see
the neighbors you you see the neighbors
using a service all the other neighbors
want to use it even if they don't want
to use it when they need it they're

[24:00]
to use it when they need it they're
going to think about you and then you
just repeat that in every group across
every group you could possibly join and
before you know it you're going to
search up whatever your service is in
the group search bar and you're going to
see nothing but testimonials for your
company and you don't have to pay a damn
thing that's amazing it's the Facebook
group version of what the door to door
salesman do like hey the Johnson's they
actually just signed up we're we're
already here right so you're going to
get a 30% disc because what we're and
the Johnson's are great yeah you're just
doing that 100% so does that scale what
do you do on year two like how do you
get to a $5 million business there's
other acquisition channels right that's
just one I always say pair that with
some type of paid ads Google local
service ads do you do it for the tree
triming business yeah it's it's easy
money because you're getting super high
intent leads who are ready to buy
they're searching for your service and
yeah people are like oh well Google
local service ads is getting more
expensive well that's why you blend it
with some organic so you drive down you
know your cost per lead your cost to
acquire a customer so pair those two
together when starting out but then you

[25:00]
together when starting out but then you
can open up so much other things like
you've got cold email and cold Outreach
to build relationships with people like
real estate agents real estate brokers
property managers apartment complexes
schools custom home builders are big
because they're going to send you the
high ticket construction cleanup jobs
where you're charging two three four
five grand you've
gotb and all the and all the people who
own a massive amount of airbnbs because
those are turning over all the time
right so you land one good Airbnb client
I talked to a guy actually who is he was
he interested in joining accelerator and
he's telling me how he was at 100K a
month because he landed one
whale rental owner who had a bunch of a
bunch of short-term rentals and then
they fired him me went from 100K down to
10K a month so oh yeah why do they fire
him he grew too fast did a crappy job
probably I don't remember what what his
reasoning was but he's like I just need
more like sustainability anyhow you've
got short-term rentals as another
Channel then you've got the big
facilities where you need the overnight
staff so there's a lot of acquisition
channels you can use there's Direct Mail

[26:00]
channels you can use there's Direct Mail
Direct Mail works really well once
you've been in business for a year or
two because then you can look at the
heat map and see where your best paying
customers are at and then you just Spam
that radius with direct mail and offers
so there's a lot of different ways you
can do to to get the customers what
would you rank your top four acquisition
channels in order of like Roi organic
paid so LSA if you're in California big
fan of Yelp big big fan of Yelp because
it's just a great bottom of the funnel
acquisition Channel people are searching
for it it's a big search engine then I'm
going or organic paid then I'm going
cold Outreach because all you need is
one relationship and it's not
necessarily recurring Revenue but it's
reoccurring because if they're building
three four homes a month let's say home
builder well you're going to get three
four construction cleans a month like as
an example my mom has a relationship
with h trik from flip and flop oh yeah
yeah
so yeah my mom handles all the
construction cleans in in Southern
California for my wife and I used to
watch that but then she's like no more

[27:00]
watch that but then she's like no more
you're looking at Christina too much
okay yes yes ma'am yeah every time it's
on she's like I cleaned that house I
cleaned it nice mom
nice okay be my number sorry to
interrupt Outreach so like organic paid
cold Outreach in that order yes but I
always recommend you do organic and paid
in tandem never just rely on one because
they're too they're not hard to get
started both of them together I just
have this I'm like building this
framework as you're talking thinking
about we were talking about binary
outcomes and there's like this beautiful
push pull that happens in small business
or big business where you have an
industry that's really really hard to do
well let's take custom home building
right nobody likes their custom home
builder I had a custom home builder for
this house he was like the best in the
area I didn't like them sorry cleave you
were really hard to work with nobody
likes their custom home builder their
house cleaner their thirdparty Logistics
provider you name it which means it's so
like the pessimistic way of looking of
that is like don't go into those
Industries it's too hard it's too hard

[28:00]
Industries it's too hard it's too hard
to do a good job the optimistic way is
there's always going to be a revolving
door of customers in those Industries
there's always going to be someone
looking for someone to do a good job so
if you're confident in yourself and if
you're going to go all in on this you
could really really stand out would you
agree with that I would 100% agree with
that and I think that's true across a
ton most Industries even in education
and and course selling the amount of
people that you compete with that just
don't care about their customers and who
just know how to sales in Market or
market and sell is insane and it's the
same thing in Home Services most people
call 10 cleaners I tell everybody I'm
like dude go call 10 cleaners in your
area I promise you I'll put my bank
account that eight of them will not
answer their phone and it's still to
this day despite all the new content
that's being made about Home Services
about how to grow your home service
business it's like the barrier is so low
to succeed and and and I've realized
it's like that in most Industries it's
not even just home services marketing
agencies people who who sell info You
Name It software yeah we had the exact

[29:01]
Name It software yeah we had the exact
same percentage you said eight out of 10
won't answer we called a thousand tree
trimming businesses to test a stump
grinding idea and 80% never answered the
phone 80% it's crazy I'm telling you man
the barrier is just so low so yeah I
agree with you because the pessimistic
way is oh I would never get into that
business but again the optimistic and
really the realistic way of looking at
it is well if you do go into this
industry are you going to take it
serious because even if you take it a
little bit serious you're going to do
better
just answer your phone yeah start there
yeah yeah so let's talk ideas business
ideas you said you had an interesting
one I want to hear it you just bringing
that up reminded me of I haven't dropped
this yet but I have a podcast coming out
with a guy named Mike Andes you know who
Mike Andes is he runs a gusta lare nope
but I'm gonna google it right now okay
gusta lanare he has a really unique way
of franching oh I know Augusta I know
Augusta he so he owns that lare yeah
okay and so this podcast is not yet but
he has a idea that I think that can
crush it and I think that he's going to
have a lot of competition for it because
it's only internal right now he doesn't

[30:01]
it's only internal right now he doesn't
sell it but his guarantee in his
landscaping business is that if I don't
answer the phone you get free service
how does he do it he has AI answering
the phone at all times and booking the
jobs 247 you can call him at it's
possible now yeah yeah I thought that
was so cool so that's a quick one that's
like his offer it's like his offer but
it's an internal tool that he spent a
lot of time building you know what that
reminds me of have you ever seen real
estate agents that promise like I
guarantee you we'll sell your home have
you ever seen that yeah it's like the
whole shtick behind that is they just
have investors that will buy it for a
30% discount if the realtor can't sell
it on the market that's the fine print
and it's it's like I guarantee I'll sell
your home or an investor will at a loss
I really like that a lot gez why isn't
everyone doing that because it's brand
new yeah yeah it's brand new and I think
it's an internal tool so I thought that
was really cool I don't feel bad about
saying that because we're going to drop
that podcast where we go really deep on
that so I think that's a cool idea for

[31:01]
that so I think that's a cool idea for
one my idea though that I thought of
when we were talking before we started
hit record so there's a major problem
that a lot of people who sell courses
and specifically higher ticket programs
so anything I would say $2,000 and above
where you in order to charge those
prices you need to have some type of
one-on-one support right anything lower
than that it's typically just maybe you
got a couple group coaching calls and a
course CSM yeah you need a account
manager or a CSM to guide them through
the whole customer Journey right what
most people can't do and I've realized
this because I've spent hundreds of
thousands of dollars on going to these
masterminds and meeting all these people
in in the infos space who sell these
high ticket programs what most people
can't do is build a backend meaning they
can't most cor Sellers and high ticket
cor sellers specifically are reliant on
uh selling more programs to cover their
costs and if something happens their ad
account gets disabled their creatives
aren't working roas starts to drop it
put you in a very risky position it's
very stressful I've been there and so

[32:01]
very stressful I've been there and so
what most people can't do is they can't
extend the lifetime value of their
customers and the way you do it I've
only seen a few companies do this but
the way they do it is by building a
backend some type of year-long
Mastermind or extended coaching program
and I see everybody who does it's a
niche it's called coaching coaches
everybody's like let me show you how to
scale your coaching business like the
coaches life coaches Co right yep but I
don't see anybody that goes and and
teaches these info people how to build a
proper backend and Ascension system and
build out an actual true client Journey
provide a good service their their
people and then take them from maybe a
5k on the front end to a 20K on the back
end right it's why company like gym
launch you compare gym launch to all the
other people who were selling gym
coaching Alex MOSI had the
$47,000 LTV where everyone else was like
four 4,000 so you can just outm Market
everybody and so that's kind what did he
do differently he had the I don't know
what it was called but he would send

[33:01]
what it was called but he would send
people into he' call them like gym Lords
and he go from I forget what he was 50
Grand a year or something yeah 50 Grand
something ridiculous 45 Grand a year and
so I know there's a massive opportunity
if you're a good especially if you're
like a software CSM and you can build
out because that's who we learn this
stuff from if you're someone in software
who's good at building out customer
Journeys I think you can charge a lot of
money and coaches would pay you a lot of
money to help them build their backends
is there a world where you could be like
a consultant and you could just say hey
send me your customer list and I'm going
to help Ascend these guys and you give
me 20% of everything I send yeah that's
like a like a pay by performance like a
fractional sales
rep yeah you could do that I think it's
challenging though because you have to
think if you're selling me hey hey I'll
teach you how to buy RV parks like okay
cool I'll pay you five grand for 16
weeks and you tell me I'm going to put
at least one RV park under contract
let's say I get through the whole thing
and that I haven't gotten my RV park yet
but I'm really close but you told me in

[34:01]
but I'm really close but you told me in
16 weeks and maybe I'm getting in week
17 but you still told me 16 weeks I've
lost all trust with you so there's no
way in hell I'm going to ascend to
whatever backend program you have right
and so it's important that you have the
activation points along the whole way
and so I do think there's a big
opportunity for someone to come in map
that out for all these different
companies allow them to actually provide
a better service than they already are
and then two extend the LTV on their
customers and you're making you're going
to make them so much more money so you
can charge a lot you're basically taking
the funnel like they come top of funnel
they get to the bottom of the funnel
they buy in their customers now that
person is just extending the funnel yeah
yeah and you've got different service
providers for every step right you've
got your conversion rate optimization
guys you got your copywriting agencies
you've got your email marketing agencies
you've got the the media buyers but
there's no one for
backends everybody's so focus on like
hey let's sell more sell more sell more
but that's not how you build a
sustainable business which of of course
they are because that's the whole name
of 90% of these guys is just get them in
the door and then forget about them

[35:00]
the door and then forget about them
right interesting I like that a lot it's
crazy how much people pay to be in these
masterminds 50 Grand a year 100 Grand a
year my most was 54 I paid 54 I'm guilty
what was that for what was it for it was
Cole Gordon's you know who that is Cole
Gordon he runs a company called
closer. I know closers doio yeah yeah
it's closers doio that's their
Mastermind it's called Uh eight
figureure
boardroom and that was fun mostly
because I think it was my first time
doing like a info Mastermind and I got
to meet all the big guys in the space
that I've seen on the ads I'm like oh
man I'm in the same room as them now
like that's kind of cool I got to meet
them and I got to learn a lot not So
Much from the content there because it
was always just so much at once
and very distracting over because we had
our plans on how we wanted to grow in
scale so it's just always very
distracting but where I got a lot of
value from was just making friends and
building relationships with people in
the industry that are doing the same
thing as me cuz I'm I can call any of
them and be like hey dude how's this
working for you how's this working for

[36:00]
working for you how's this working for
you so that's the most value I got out
of it I didn't eventually renew but yeah
it was cool for a year yeah it's hard to
put a price on those connections right
mhm what are you seeing in the Home
Services space that like you're jealous
of have you talked to anyone in the
industry and they're doing you
landscaping or whatever like something
random and you're like ah gez we need to
roll that into what we're doing if I
would have chased that I would have done
a little better what are you seeing or
hearing out there all the different home
services are just crushing it I mean I
think you can really pick anyone and
just run up a really big business
there's private Equity backed everything
now at this point fencing companies
garage door installation like Tommy
melow just sold his business 500 million
and it was only half of it then he roll
he's rolling it into the next to get the
second bite of the apple or any other
opportunities like a software that you
could build within a home service Niche
that's in demand or in the cleaning
business even I think there's a lot for
us specifically I think there's a big
opportunity for us to build our own
software for sure cuz we have the
distribution already but again that's a

[37:01]
distribution already but again that's a
whole another business but as far as
tools and stuff like that I can't think
of any off the top other than the one I
first talked about the whole like 24/7
answering I think that's applicable
across you know all Home Services I just
talked with Aaron Harper who is doing on
the podcast he's got the fastest growing
pressure washing franchise and I asked
him a similar question I said if you
were to restart and build a whole new
franchise what would it be and he said
would I forgot what he said he would do
I want to say it was like insulation or
something and I'm seeing a couple new
Insulation Companies or no maybe it was
epoxy flooring that's a big one too
that's catching a lot of see him is the
garage epoxy flooring charge charged so
much money I think four grand yeah I
talked to this guy named forever
self-employed actually he does like the
pressure washing videos where he does
the voiceovers he said he ran 10 grand
of Google ads and returned 100 Grand
epoxy flooring sales so he says holy cow
I think it rang true across multiple
people I talked to that epoxy flooring

[38:00]
people I talked to that epoxy flooring
was something that's really hot that I
don't see a lot of people talking about
I worry about that with a recession
though just because it's not a have to
have yeah and there's no like there's no
recurring Revenue really it's right
right you sell you're always in sales
mode and I don't I'm not a big fan of
businesses like that yeah same well
