[00:00]
my question is so I'm trying to decide
between these
two these two different
ideas one is I've got a real estate
investing newsletter I write like a
personal story I try to make it funny
what just would happen to me during the
week then I paste in three popular real
estate tweets and add commentary under
each one the ultimate goal of the
newsletter is to raise money to buy real
estate down the line this idea though
the con I think is the value ad isn't
super clear and I'm know like real like
I've got door so I'm no real estate
Guru idea number two would be to I'm
basing this off the joy list which I'm
not sure if you know what that is but
they they're based in New York City they
it's all about making friends in New
York City and they send a Weekly
Newsletter that has fun events to do in
New York City where you meet people I
would do one for my city and this is the
value at on this one's much more clear
there's a pain point that me and my
friends have

[01:00]
friends have
I soured on this a little bit though
because I looked at their website
yesterday and they've got they're bigger
they've the one I'm basing it off was
was got 7,500
subscribers but I looked at their
website and they're charging like a
hundred bucks for an ad so I think okay
maybe there's not a lot of money there
actually so if it doesn't make money it
wouldn't probably make a ton of sense
but it seems like a more interesting
idea and the the value at is very clear
where is with the real estate the value
ad at least for what I'm doing if you
don't know me you might not you're
probably not going to be interested in
like my personal story and what I'm
doing that week so I was just interested
in hearing your guys' thoughts and which
idea I should be going with yeah okay so
I'm going to repeat that a little bit
because either I cut out or you cut out
at some point so I'll just rehash it and
then it'll also help me help if I
understand the question so you're
tossing around two different newsletter
ideas one is they're both L are they
both local or is the investor one not
well the investor one's not it's more
just about me and what I'm doing so not

[02:00]
just about me and what I'm doing so not
really okay so your investor newsletter
idea is to kind of send out a few
popular real estate tweets of the week
or month and then add some funny
commentary around it right just add to
the Tweet a little bit with some humor
yeah that's what I've been doing but as
I've been doing this for the last
several weeks I'm okay there's maybe no
value add really to
this okay do you follow Sean P's like
five tweets of the week newsletter I do
that's actually what where I got the
idea from it's the simar I was doing
five too but then I switched to three
but yeah it's like the same it's like
the same thing I just add a personal
story yeah okay I love I assumed you got
that idea from there I I love that he's
doing that because it probably takes 10
minutes you're on Twitter all week
anyway and it's just like a way to stay
relevant for a very low amount of time
and honestly I'm kind of mad that I
didn't do that because my newsletter
takes
hours but so that's your first idea take
some popular real estate tweets of the
week email them out to newsletters

[03:00]
week email them out to newsletters
and with the ultimate monetization goal
of raising money from LPS okay and the
other one is basically like a joy list
for Phoenix where you are but you're not
so sure on that one because it it's
probably hard to monetize as much as you
would like it to be monetized right
exactly yeah okay so to me this is
assuming do do you have a passion around
the joy list idea or are you kind of
ambivalent about either
one I'm kind of ambivalent like the with
the joy List It seems like it'd be
entertaining and I like making new
friends so I I like the idea and it's a
paino of mine so it's interesting in
that way but yeah it's not like I get
super jacked up about it or
anything okay I just thought it could
kill two yeah to me it's very sorry yeah
totally to me it's very clear and I've
had I've never had this investor idea
for a newsletter that you do but I've
had the idea to start a local newsletter
because I think that's sexy and
interesting and I like the thought of
being like a local expert but to me it's
I'm kind of I'm already kind of doing

[04:01]
I'm kind of I'm already kind of doing
the investor thing with my newsletter
and with Twitter I because I don't
really directly monetize anything I
don't have ads I don't sell sponsorships
and I don't really launch things but I
do post about RV parks we're buying and
it brings investor interest in and over
these last two weeks particularly I've
just been thinking holy cow like
particularly related to Twitter I I
can't think of a higher and better use
of a Twitter account than doing real
estate invest like raising money from
Real Estate Investors because yeah
you're building trust at scale they see
you talk about real estate they see and
assume you're not an idiot and so they
read your stuff for weeks months years
on end and then they have an opportunity
to invest in that whereas with a what's
your value per subscriber going to be on
a local newsletter 50 cents a month $2 a
month whereas with a real estate
investor it or a real estate investing
newsletter it could be 100 to a thousand

[05:01]
newsletter it could be 100 to a thousand
times that and if you're passionate
about both and I honestly the investor
one will probably take less time too the
one thing I would add is if you make it
humorous don't make it too humorous just
because yeah I've witnessed guys on
Twitter that they lean into that so hard
that they're just kind of like a joke
they're kind of a comedian and it's no
it's like oh then they tweet something
serious and it's nah are they trolling
and it's just it's really good for
clicks and Views but it's a lot harder
to monetize so if I were you I would
show humor just enough to show your
personality but not lean into it so hard
and I don't think you said you would do
that but that's just kind of an anecdote
but I would also add that at the end of
every email or at the beginning you just
you put in some sort of smart commentary
that shows your readers that you know
about real estate too like that you have
value to add just as much if not more
than these tweets you're including

[06:01]
than these tweets you're including
that makes sense because that's actually
what I wanted to do but my thing was too
that yeah I have seven units so that's
maybe impressive if you're like 20 but
it's hard I think to show you're an
expert and raise money maybe I don't
want to come over and say I'm an expert
or something um because I just see all
these big accounts these people own like
tons of apartments and whatever and
that's not really the angle I can go
obviously that's been my kind of thing I
don't want to look like cheesy or
whatever like SS about real estate I'm
not like some Legend yeah I totally get
it I think the way around that is to
instead of positioning yourself as the
owner of x amount of units position
yourself as the guy who looks at real
estate investing a really interesting
way or that has received that has
experienced really outsized returns or
done a unique strategy with your real
estate as opposed to like trying to be
trying to compete with Grant Cardone on
Pomp and fluff yeah yeah that makes
sense but I like that idea man I want to

[07:00]
sense but I like that idea man I want to
hear back and see how it goes yeah
thanks Carter thanks for calling in
welcome everyone uh listening or
watching and especially welcome Jimmy
you've got a question for me about your
short-term rentals in Georgia so let's
hear it yeah man so I've actually got
yeah I've got one cabin in blidge and
I've got two actually in Pigeon Forge
Gatlinburg area and they're both the one
and they're both kind of like just
standard cabins but they're very the one
and blid is walking distance the tcoa
you can see the tcoa River on the back
porch the Pigeon Forge one is so I my
question to you is just like how can I
differentiate my cabins and start doing
more like marketing and getting more
direct bookings I just need to increase
revenue and I'm white I would obviously
like to not spend a lot to get that but
yeah I need to increase revenue for both
cabins so I was thinking go like a some
kind of flly fishing angle but I would
love for you just to take the ball and

[08:01]
love for you just to take the ball and
run with it and get your advice yeah
okay so two cabins total or more three
total two in Pigeon Forge one in Blue
Ridge one in Blue Ridge okay and I would
guess that they were doing a lot better
kind of postco and then it's you're a
little oversaturated now trying to
differentiate yeah 100% I had a
nightmare the other night you know what
it was it was that there were ads on
this podcast but I would never do that
to you you know what I would do I would
Shake namelessly ask you to like And
subscribe to this and to share it with
only 1300 of your friends yeah 100% it's
just like revenues down and it's not
like anything like Armageddon like what
you see on social media but it's it's
just I'm just trying to make it better
more profitable just trying to get
Revenue back up yeah okay now if you
were to say if you were to look at all
the other cabins in those areas where
does your stand as far as amenities that
are concerned between a like a 10 being
like five grand a night and that's on
water slide and a one being like a

[09:01]
water slide and a one being like a
freaking tent in the woods sure sure I a
solid F right like it they all have hot
tubs but they're they all have pool
tables and stuff but it's just kind of
like standard stuff so maybe that's like
a six or something but yeah okay okay
and what is your occupancy looking like
lately that you would like and you'd
like to get it to like 80 90% I
assume yeah it was it was probably like
for bluid like 506 60 and then in
pitchon Forge like 70 to 80 and that's
that's just a number but those are like
really messy numbers because like
January and February both markets it's
like zero but then in December it's like
100% so that's yeah okay cool which one
if you could wave a magic wand which one
do you care about most which one would
you rather fix it Blue Ridge by far we
love as a family we love Blue Ridge
Georgia and it's out I know you've been
to Pigeon Forge and stuff so you know
that scene but Blu Ridge is very outdoor

[10:00]
that scene but Blu Ridge is very outdoor
Centric there is no franchises or
there's no even go-kart tracks or
anything there it's just all outdoor
stuff yeah okay tell me what you were
thinking with fly fishing specifically I
know you mentioned that yeah my big idea
I like your approach of like actual
steps but my big idea was to like get a
direct booking website but but really
market and stuff with promote even on
Instagram like promoting the fly fishing
aspect and like getting the local guides
like getting them involved promote them
and then they in turn promote my cabin
and get bookings and like that way and
and then but eventually I'd have my own
Client List So eventually I can build up
something a fly fishing C because I'd
love a place at West like Idaho or
something as well so I can eventually
sell this as a portfolio to like Orvis
or Sims or whoever in the Adventure
Outdoor space somebody looking at
building building a fly fishing brand

[11:00]
building building a fly fishing brand
okay so you not only want to increase
the the occupancy but you might want to
actually scale this if you can figure
out how to fix this occupancy issue then
you want to lean into this s this
business more because I know you've got
a zillion businesses like yeah yeah I
right now I'm just trying to increase
revenue and stuff but it doesn't all
that what I just described that's very
manageable and actual I I can get that
done next month but I just wanted to be
smart about like where I invest my
incremental Capital I'm wanting to get
the highest Returns on invested Capital
possible for this so I just wanted your
opinion on what to do okay so what I
think you could do one thing is lean
into the fly fishing side that's your
idea and do some keyword research look
for some like kind of low traffic but
High intent longtail two to six-word
keywords related to fly fishing or
fishing in bluebridge and then I would
put up a completely separate website

[12:00]
put up a completely separate website
and you can do one of two things so one
you can just advertise your own do you
currently have a website where you
advertise these yourself or you only on
the big plat okay so one is you could do
that and you could just start with your
own website and get direct bookings and
you're gonna get nothing for a while but
I would start on the back end generating
some content and you can even use AI to
make this content what Stephen om man
and his partner Sam Thompson they're
starting a business that's really
interesting where they use a bunch of
automation to generate articles like
keyword Rich articles on a daily or
weekly or however often basis that's
fully automated on the back end and just
publishes to your website and they're
having insane
results what are they called yeah it's
called unlimited content unlimited
content unlimited content yeah yep
that's what it is hard
done and I they value prop is like
basically 80 90% of the benefit of SEO
for 80 to 90 % less right yeah because

[13:01]
for 80 to 90 % less right yeah because
it's automated and they're making no
bones about it it's AI but I kind of
like that from a business angle because
it you can't really you can't Tech
advancement won't put them out of
business they're leading into Tech
advancement right yeah anyway I have no
affiliation with them but it's a
conversation I had this last week that
just came to mind anyway I so I would
start by doing that no matter what step
one create a direct booking website you
follow Isaac French at all hell yeah
yeah have you you thought about taking
his master class
cuz yeah this is exactly what he talks
about for sure for sure he yeah it's uh
I thought I'm sure you f Richard fertig
as well like his stomp Capital yeah like
he he was the one he actually had this
idea of fly fish from I don't know if
you've met any like doubt Hard fly
fishing people they're they will spend
unlimited money unlimited time on it and
it's kind of so he's what the one that
actually got me to think about this and
of course like I haven't done anything

[14:01]
of course like I haven't done anything
with it but yeah that's yeah both of
them yeah that's exactly what what I was
going for yeah so that would be step one
direct bookings and it's kind of like a
farce in a way because you've got the
direct bookings available right on the
front homepage people aren't necessarily
going to find you unless you push paid
ads to it but on the back end you're
going to be running I all types of
keyword Rich content that will take
weeks and months and years to play out
but I think you're patient and you're
you're will wait um so I would do that
and it shouldn't take too long and you
can kind of do that passively and then
step two is to and I'm only suggesting
this to you because I know you like
starting new
businesses think about starting like a
like a a like a local Marketplace for
fly fishermen and so on one side you you
get all the local fly fishing shops or
guides in the within a 2-hour radius
listed you can use outs scraper to find
them and then on the front end you can

[15:00]
them and then on the front end you can
push paid ads to it and find fly
fishermen and at first there's no
mention of your short-term rentals it
just looks like it's a fly fishing a
local fly fishing Marketplace and then
you can use something like share tribe
they're that's like a Marketplace
software that I used eight years ago um
that I'm sure they have a bunch of
competitors by now it's the only one and
then as you make these relationships
with the fly fishing shops you can start
it out for free just Hey My My name's
Jimmy I'm going to send traffic your way
what's the cost I don't know yet but for
now just enjoy these free leads we'll
figure it out and then win SL iFit works
then you can start talking about either
charging them on a perly basis or taking
a percentage of Revenue they they get or
being creative and saying you know what
where are you guys staying I don't know
I don't care I just I'm a guide what if
you what if instead of you paying me for
these leads I give you leads and I pay
you and if you send me people to in my
cabins I'll give you 10% of the booking

[16:01]
cabins I'll give you 10% of the booking
which that could be 200 bucks it could
be 50 bucks something like that and that
way they're like incent like they love
you you're overd delivering you're
giving them free leads and you're paying
them just to recommend your
cabins what do you think I love it I'll
love it the big thing I don't know how
deep you've dumped into like Richard
fertic post but what's interesting is
over 50% of his Revenue isn't bookings
it's the ancillary services that he does
and his Outer Banks project with the
wind surf so the same thing he's done
for wind Surfers and the Outer Banks
like I was thinking fla Fisher so I was
trying to just figure that out but
obviously with like limited resources so
that's I love all that okay anything
else that should be that should be
enough to get you going that's great man
I love the show love the feedback thanks
so much all right thanks man all right
thanks yep see y welcome awesome thanks
so much for having me I appreciate it
absolutely so all I know about you is

[17:03]
absolutely so all I know about you is
video
production that's right yeah I'll give
you a little bit of background for
context so I started my video production
company about seven years ago but over
the past couple years the revenues
flattened out and I've really struggled
with growing it in any sort of like
consistent or predictable way I I have
tried cold email called LinkedIn
Outreach Facebook and Google ads but I
haven't found anything that that works
really well really just love to hear any
advice or ideas you might have on how to
kind of predictably and reliably grow
the video business I do have a few ideas
I could pitch but I just kind of curious
to hear your thoughts and I'm happy to
answer any questions you might have for
that okay where are you located where's
your business uh I'm in San Antonio
Texas okay and is everything you're
doing local or do you travel for stuff
or do anything
remotely we do travel and we do a decent
amount of projects uh remotely now I've

[18:00]
amount of projects uh remotely now I've
started doing some work on upwork just
to kind of get typically lower value
projects but all my editors are remote
so we can do kind of like animated
motion graphics and explainer videos and
that kind of stuff all remotely without
having to be in person but we do travel
if the client if the budget works for
the client okay and when you're on
upwork are you doing like explainer
videos and stuff like that is that your
average job yeah primarily on upwork
there is some like shoots stuff that
come from that I'm actually going up to
Dallas next week for a shoot with
McKesson that came through upw work of
all things but most of it editing
projects social media videos animated
explainers that kind of stuff and are
you on Thumbtack at all or Angie's List
I have been yeah I'm actually thinking
about getting back on it I was having a
similar issue where the you know a lot
of those platforms are kind of raced to
the bottom so it was hard to charge my
like normal rate but but yeah I've
because I've since hired someone
fulltime who's just doing upwork

[19:00]
fulltime who's just doing upwork
proposals all day every day that's just
started the past couple weeks I'm
thinking about having them do like
attack proposals while they're at it
yeah I asked that because I found my
video guy on thumb Tech and I paid him
many thousands of dollars and I found
him like seven years ago and I still
call him for stuff yeah sample size of
one but does Angie do that as
well does Angie have I think I listing I
haven't looked at Angie I think they're
primarily home service but I haven't
checked to see if they have but I
definitely can look into that as well
have you heard of the site as it like
sparefoot uh I don't think so I think
it's like a let me pull it up it's like
an Airbnb for renting out space in like
random spaces for photo shoots and stuff
like that oh no it's not spare foot
that's Self Storage P space maybe yes
Pier space yeah yeah yes have you heard
of them yes I've heard of them thought
about that too I don't actually
currently have a physical space we

[20:01]
currently have a physical space we
typically travel to the client's address
but one of my ideas was getting a space
that's I'm definitely open to that
possibility but typically I haven't
needed one because we just go on
location and now with since Co there's
been a lot more of the remote stuff as
well yeah and I was asking because I was
wondering out loud if there's a way you
could potentially leverage that platform
in a different way because okay a lot of
people that are your potential customers
customers are going to peer space now
you could easily say these are my
competitors going to peer space but I
bet you'd be surprised that there are
influencers and other types of
businesses that are looking at peer
space that still need a videographer for
projects I'm wondering if there is if
they have like a public directory or a
listing or anything or any sort of
partner program where you could weasle
your way in there or even do you do
weddings very often or is that just not
your JY no typic Al we haven't we've
done a couple many years ago but it's

[21:01]
done a couple many years ago but it's
not our the bread and Bre for
sure are you not interested in in doing
weddings I think it's possible it's kind
of like a completely different animal in
a way so I know a lot of like my staff
that are doing the shoots now like I
would probably have to find more people
to do it different people to film that
those and I think the editors could
potentially do it but it's almost in my
mind it's almost like a different
business which is fine I'm happy to kind
of pivot where the where it is that's
just not something that I've really
pursued
that it's almost like if you take on
weddings and you might as well just
Chase your shiny object syndrum and
start something else entirely that could
be more profit exactly gotta yeah what
does your average ticket size and what
does your average job look like like
what type of job is it a messen type job
or smaller
businesses yeah traditionally it's it's
kind of like the corporate thing we show
up on site historically this is what
we've done a lot of it show up on site
do some interviews maybe it's scripted
or maybe they're just questions maybe
like customer testimonials that kind of

[22:01]
like customer testimonials that kind of
stuff and and those projects can run
anywhere from, 1500 to 2,000 upwards to
10 to 15,000 is kind of the range that
we play there's people that'll do it for
50 or 100 and there's people that'll do
it for 500 bucks and then with the
remote stuff like on upw work the
average project size is like 500 bucks
okay okay what if you could pick like a
niche or an industry that you've worked
with in the past in this business what
has what have been your
favorites yeah so I've worked a lot with
technology companies because I actually
used to work at Rackspace back in the
day so that's where a lot of my network
was so I've done a lot of cyber security
tech companies I like those and also
done my biggest client is like a
healthcare a large Healthcare client
with like hundreds or thousands of
clinics and but that's more so it's not
so much the healthcare part it's just
the fact that they're a larger company
and they they're not cheap they
understand the value of what I do so
it's not like having to kind of argue
with them over the value of the service
that that s things so that's what I like
about them and then the only other thing

[23:01]
about them and then the only other thing
recently is since I've hired the motion
graph graphic designers on the team I've
liked doing these animated explainers
because there is good margin there but
it's a lot of people there's a lot of
demand for that kind of project as well
so is that something thing like sorry go
ahead is that something you think you
want to you keep leaning into the
animated
stuff yeah I think so I think there's a
lot of opportunity there okay and what
what were you
saying I was going to say that the other
side of it that I haven't really done a
lot of is the more recent like Tik Tok
Shorts YouTube all that kind of stuff
the creators types videos which it's in
the same space but it's almost like the
weddings in that it's not where there's
a lot of demand and you've got like the
clip and all those guys that do the
monthly recurring service which I like
the idea of that of having people it's
almost just like the pure labor
Arbitrage model but it's also not the
types of stuff we've done traditionally
so I don't know if it makes sense to
kind of pivot that direction when it's
not the background of what we've been

[24:01]
not the background of what we've been
doing yeah on when it comes to thumb
teac what percentage of the jobs the
total potential jobs out there would you
say that you're bidding on
today on some tech or
on yeah we so I got a couple filters on
there we kind of ignore like the lower
dollar amount projects and we focus on
primarily the us only jobs but we we're
basically every job that's something
that we would do right now we're bidding
on all of them it's about maybe 10
proposals a day for that and again we're
ignoring like the $30 an hour in under
projects or like the
$250 projects that kind of stuff so okay
there's more out there especially if you
take the US filter off but but yeah any
idea of of how many what percentage of
those jobs you're getting we're starting
to track that now I don't have the
perfect numbers but I'd say it's
probably about one out of every 10 right
now maybe one out of every 15 proposals

[25:02]
now maybe one out of every 15 proposals
so we're trying to tweak our proposals
to get higher response rates and things
like that but are you doing personalized
video
proposals I've done a little bit of that
in the past I'm not currently doing it
though here's if I were you I would do
exactly what you're doing on upwork I
would ignore the smaller jobs not worth
your time but I would aim to get two or
three out of every 10 jobs that you
apply for just by being super unique and
creative
what would you say is the average ticket
size of an upwork job typically about
$500 is like the average is about 10
hours of editing we're right now we're
pretty low at50 or $60 an hour just to
kind of build up the profile although
there are like one out of every so many
clients is going to be something where
oh we want to do 20 videos over the next
year so it kind of ends up being a
bigger lifetime value of the client but
the project sizes are relatively small
most of the time okay can you foresee
any of them turning into recurring

[26:01]
any of them turning into recurring
engagements yeah we're working on we've
actually gotten a couple clients in the
past few weeks that are recurring
clients so that's that's why I kind of
double down on upwork the only issue I
kind of see with with this model is like
to get to any sort of like reasonable or
like sizable revenue of like I'd love to
be in the1 to2 million Revenue range
it's like you're doing the math and it's
okay that means I'm going to have a team
of like 20 editors doing you know 800
hours a week of or whatever the math
works out to be at this kind of rate I
mean there are some larger rate stuff on
upwork but it's few and far between so
typically it's in that $40 to $60 range
so it's I want to scale and it seems
like it'd be easier to do that with more
going direct to the corporate route but
that's also where I've struggled to get
any traction with the acquisition side
yeah it's really tough doing cold
outbound to those corporate accounts
that's why I'm just racking my brain
it's you've put yourself in this niche
of corporate stuff but that stuff is
just so hard to find so you said you've

[27:03]
just so hard to find so you said you've
tried paperclick stuff Google
ads yep yep I've tried Google ads and I
think there I know so the issue is with
all these methods like I know there are
people who are making it work so it's I
don't know if it's me maybe I'm not
sticking with it long enough maybe I'm
not bitting on the right things but it
wasn't I wasn't able to get it
profitable when I tried it this was
about a year or two ago all right I I
would there's some software out there AI
software where you can upload a video
and then you can have it like swap out a
key sentence or a key word so I would do
video proposals for everything on upwork
front and center personalized you
already have someone like you've hired
someone to do this job for you which is
great I would have that person I'm sure
they're already applying as fast as they
can I would have them start including in
the application as much personal info
about that job poster as they can and
that might involve them clicking through

[28:00]
that might involve them clicking through
to the profile looking at the company
going in oh okay finding like a random
article or story about that company from
years ago using the web archive web.
archive to find something on their
website that they don't offer anymore
like it sounds like a lot of research
but some of this stuff once you're well
versed at it will take five to 10
minutes so really just dive deep and
have them say hey first name hey why
aren't you offering X or Y or Z anymore
I really like not just commenting on the
job post but commenting on the company
stuff that you have to find outside of
upwork yet applying inside of upwork
because I have been posting to upwork
since it was called
odest probably over a thousand job posts
and so I have gotten so many
applications and a lot of these guys
circumvent upw work and they'll cold
email me they'll see me they'll see my
name and they'll do this kind of
research I'm talking about and it pisses
me off like I I could be an exception
but I hate it like I hate people going

[29:01]
but I hate it like I hate people going
outside of upwork like I'm using upwork
because I want to stay on upwork I could
be an exception right and so if I'm an
exception then go do that because
they're probably doing it over and over
because it works if I'm not an exception
it's worth testing for sure then do all
that outside research and it's no
different than a job applicant that
you're hiring for coming in and saying
hi I love that your company does this
and you used to do this but you pivot it
you're just like wow you're flattered
and your ego takes over and you're like
N I like this guy or he could be a
terrible employee but he did his
research so you have all this positive
confirmation bias going into this
interview that is probably going to make
you want to hire him so I would treat
upwork like a job interview and do all
that research if there's only 10 a day
as you say like that's just a part-time
job for a VA and then make a
personalized video
and see how it goes first with using AI
to swap out like that first sentence
because you want to plug in the name of
their company or their first name right

[30:00]
their company or their first name right
in the beginning because most people
won't watch past 5 seconds and then
after that it's the same video for
everyone right you're just copying
pasting it right and then see if you can
get that acceptance rate from 10 to 20
or 30% now I do you think that would be
a meaningful difference to your business
if you were to double or triple your
upor side of the business or is it still
kind of I got to do more than that
yeah I think it is Meaningful we just
really started upward seriously a few
months ago it is just it's it feels I
think it's meaningful and it's worth
doing and I I definitely will do that
but it's kind of like a lot of all this
effort and then it might equal one of
one of my larger corporate clients to
get like a bunch of these smaller ones
which is that might just be the game
that I need to play but it's it's hard
to yeah wow this these 10 upward clients
are paying me like half of what my one
large corporate client is paying me
every month and with a lot more back and

[31:00]
every month and with a lot more back and
forth and stuff but but it's competitive
and it is a fairly commoditized skill at
this point so it's hard to figure out
where that angle is necessarily yeah I
like the idea of being able to sell
explainer videos to companies all over
the world but we both know that's
something that AI is just G to crush
right whereas doing stuff like your
Market is plenty big enough for you to
have a 10 million plus Dollar business
so leaning into using this upwork hack
that I'm talking about to kind of boost
your enthusiasm and your ego and get you
excited about the business again so you
don't keep looking around at other ideas
right but but then I would also start at
the same time just starting a drip
campaign scraping like a targeted list
of emails uh in your area and I know
it's hard but there's something about
Michael Scott says always be closing
right I say always be sending cold
emails a much longer acronym but like
when you always have a campaign going of

[32:01]
when you always have a campaign going of
50 to 200 emails a day to complete
strangers you're just always in the game
right yeah it's like you're right now
you're sitting on the bench at the
baseball game and you're not getting
called you're never going to hit a home
run because you're never even going up
to bat but if you're just putting your
name in inboxes all day every day
something's going to hit and then one of
those things that hit will be recurring
so even if you're like this the
potential promise of this and your
outbound response rate is much lower
than a traditional business it's worth
doing and then I would also
explore putting your stuff out there
using Tik Tok and and Instagram to your
advantage from like behind the scenes
behind the curtains like the life of
video you've seen those videos I've seen
them where it's like a picture of the
camera right showing how you make
certain shots I think that could go a
long way but I would put that as like
opportunity number three if of of these
three whereas the other two would be the

[33:01]
three whereas the other two would be the
higher and better use of your
time yeah no I like that I appreciate
that that makes a lot of sense can I
just pitch one brief idea around this
video business just to hear your
feedback so yeah I'll make it really
quick one idea I had was leasing a space
in like a large office building and
building like a small podcast video
studio and using that as like a lead gen
within the hopefully it's a a building
that's big that has of tenants and even
potentially partnering with the landlord
either making it like an amenity like a
fitness center except it's a podcast
studio and having the landlord pay me
some like disc discounted rate and using
that as a lead gen almost okay I'll do
this like lowc cost podcast or whatever
with the idea that oh I can pitch the
podcast editing services or other
videos yeah so I don't know if that you
think would be worth pursuing or should
focus on this other stuff first honestly
you could do like a wework or a wework
knockoff off where it's just a month-to
month and you're like I just need this

[34:00]
month and you're like I just need this
office it's exclusive it's not a shared
office and that way if it doesn't work
out you just pull the plug and then
throw up a website start reaching out to
people like certain like local
entrepreneurship groups would be perfect
because these are guys that if they
don't already have a podcast they're
about to have a podcast and they'll want
a podcast and they probably live at home
with crying kids and it's just a place
for them to escape to it you could
structure it a zillion different ways
you could rent it out by the hour as
needed flat monthly rate limited usage
additional cost for editing or the
editing is lumped in you could do any
number of things and then you could even
use it as your own office when it's not
being rented out that's a great idea and
maybe it doesn't even need to be a lead
gen Source maybe it could just be a
self-sustaining business in and of
itself and a lead gen Source that's a
great idea yeah man sounds like you've
got a great thing going I want you to
follow up with me tell me how
everything's going absolutely have a
good day yep me too
ra hey guys what's going on how are you

[35:02]
ra hey guys what's going on how are you
I'm doing great you're looking to raise
capital for a local like shipping store
right correct exactly basically I've
been looking to acquire business and
instead of going on bu bisell and all
these different sites I figured why
don't I just go in my local area and
just go talk to business owners so this
shipping store is 2 minutes down the
road from our house and talk to the
owner for a few hours a couple weeks ago
and they they do mailing and shipping of
packages they do passport photos things
like that and he is open to selling he's
at that age where he wants to retire and
do something else and he's looking for
$660,000
cash he's not open to seller financing
because apparently he's been burned
before um in a previous sell of the
business so he's against that and he did
provide me the financials so I I kind of
wanted to get like deal analysis but

[36:01]
wanted to get like deal analysis but
also maybe ideas on getting Capital as
well and do you think you need Capital
to for all of this or a portion of it
all of it ideally yeah I have some cash
saved but like I'd rather I'd rather
just Finance the entire deal and what
makes you interested in the shipping
store of all other types of businesses I
like this business in particular because
it's pretty dead simple on how it works
and in addition to that I like how there
are so many opportunities to improve
this business as it is right now he has
90 mailboxes that are about 80%
occupancy I would immediately add more
mailboxes the other thing is his pricing
for everything is is not in line with
like the averages of competitors so I
would increase prices there as well so I
see opportunity in like increasing the
business like right off the Jump and
then on top of that it's not that much
Capital up front so it's 60,000 Bucks

[37:01]
Capital up front so it's 60,000 Bucks
versus a lot of businesses on the
websites like B by cell are three four
500,000 if not more how many shipping
stores are in your area aside from this
one so there's one that's in the area
maybe like a mile or two away but it has
one and a half star rating on Google and
it's like probably 25 reviews so it's
like really not a place that people like
going to his store has about 25 reviews
four and a half stars and then we do
have a UPS store and a USPS as well but
he is an authorized shipper for UPS USPS
DHL and FedEx and the other nice thing
is like the shopping center that he's in
and there's a Kroger and there's like a
bunch of other there's like a Planet
Fitness so there's tons of like foot
traffic and like tons of parking so
really high visibility area as well
would you say that his location is
better than the one with the one and a

[38:00]
better than the one with the one and a
half Stars correct what are you doing
right now do you have a W2 and how many
hours per week are you actually working
I don't have a W2 I do contract sales
work so I eat what I kill and I work as
much as I want or don't want you enjoy
doing that I like selling I I do like
selling but I don't want to go back into
the W2 cuz what I've noticed is when I
work my W2 if I get into this phase of
okay learning doing well and then I just
either get bored or I get tired of just
like working for the man I guess you
could say so this seems to be like a
great way to just get my foot into the
door of like entrepreneurship and
starting a business and then eventually
hiring an operator and then flipping it
and doing something or and doing
something else
eventually what would you say the the
max potential for this one location is
if you were to fully optimize it real
ically not if you're 100% occupied with
twice as many mail boxes but like

[39:01]
twice as many mail boxes but like
conservatively what would be the net
profit in your pocket net profit in my
pocket right now he gave me the last
three years of his p&l and he's
averaging around 142,000 in re in
Topline revenue and so I'm thinking that
I could double the
revenue and he's running at like 25%
profit margins or net profit
so guess what does that put 35 Grand
yeah okay so he's selling it for two
times profits basically yeah and how
many people live in your area if you
were to buy a different business based
on how far you'd be willing to drive to
operate that business about how many
people live
there so I don't know I know that like
our neighborhood in particular there are
2,000 homes in our neighborhood but
outside of that neighborhood there are

[40:00]
outside of that neighborhood there are
more residential homes and there's lots
of like lowincome Apartments so we live
in an area that is probably like 70% or
60% low-income Hispanic lots of check
caching Services lots of launder mats
lots of dry cleaners things like that
are in the
area okay so your question mostly
revolves around how if I'm understanding
correctly how to raise the money to buy
this business right EX exactly and the
thing is I've looked into SBA loan but
my concern with SBA is that he has a
couple buyers that reached out to him
already and basically they're just like
hey I need a little more time like six
months like three to six months and I
know that the SBA process can take a
good chunk of time so and of course I
just don't know if it's worth it for
$60,000 but that's really the only
Avenue I've
explored if you were to raise money from
friends or family do you have a track
record that you could point to
I don't have a business track record no

[41:00]
I don't have a business track record no
I I just have again just a W2 and like
cor corporate reputation so yeah that's
I I don't have a business ownership
background
though okay so here's what I think I
honestly I think you will regret if you
end up buying this business I I know
this industry fairly well I've I used to
drop off packages at stores like this
for my e-commerce business a decade ago
I I just think that for the amount of
effort it's going to take to really take
out a 10 out of 10 execution on this you
could put the same or less amount of
effort into a different opportunity and
make two to 20 times more I don't know
if you listen to my first million but on
a recent episode they said the phrase
like 10 out of 10 execution and one out
of ten idea or opportunity I look at
that like this I think if you're able to
convince someone without and I think you
could be able to I think there's a lot
of money out there especially for people

[42:00]
of money out there especially for people
without a a big track or not especially
but including for people without a huge
track record or a big business
background I still think you could be
able to raise money for this but I don't
think that you should I just think that
your ceiling is way too capped for all
of the stress it's going to take to run
and own and buy and operate a business
like this and I used to have retail
businesses my iPhone repair shops and it
was I hated it man it's it sucked it was
just picking pennies up in front of a
steamroller like it was meeting people
and they get angry about whatnot and
it's they're right there in your face
and it's just man I could be making
money on the internet and I'm not saying
you need to go buy an internet business
necessarily but I think you should be
patient and lean into your skills as a
salesperson which are very hard to find
like it's hard to acquire those skills
especially if you tell me that you like
selling like why sell $10 a month widget
or a $30 a month widget when you can
sell a three3 $300,000 widget right like

[43:04]
sell a three3 $300,000 widget right like
look into life insurance salesman can
make millions of dollars a year It's a
Grind it it takes you got to eat crap
for a while but I would just suggest
entirely that you lean into your
salesmanship and don't even necessarily
focus on starting a business but focus
on buying undervalued cars on Facebook
Marketplace and and flipping them or
just start by flipping stuff because you
can sell so selling is a hard part beoo
I'm a robot I'm AI you're watching
artificial intelligence asking you to
like And subscribe you're cringing but
I'm cringing more I'm dead inside so
selling is a hard part the easier part
is buying and honestly a lot of those
skills are the same it's just people
skills soft skills working with people
and you know what I'm saying so I would
just if you want extra income I would
start by doing onesie TWY things that
get get your juices flowing get your
gears turning get some money in your

[44:00]
gears turning get some money in your
pocket building a track record and then
when you do go to raise money for
something make sure that thing is sales
focused so the track record you lean on
can be based on sales and not based on
business ownership yeah that makes sense
what do you yeah I I think you're I
think you're on to something it's just I
could definitely see it being a low
ceiling and then obviously like retail
you it's a place that opens that's open
Monday through Saturday and and somebody
has to be there and if it's not open
you're not making any money
so it's it's definitely a challenge
there yeah you go to Home Depot and buy
a $200 pressure washer and go knock some
doors make a th000 bucks like you you
can't have pride like no matter what you
do you can't have pride or it's just not
going to work and so just take these
valuable skills that you have and I know
you you feel like this sunk cost fallacy
or committed to this deal you've already
talked to this guy and you you're like
kind of romantic about it and you've
probably made spreadsheets but don't let

[45:01]
probably made spreadsheets but don't let
that get in the way of an opportunity
that you I think you will most likely
regret in the
future yeah that makes sense yeah I I
was just going to say there are even
bigger opportunities than that where you
don't need to raise any money like a
home service business right like I would
seriously start looking into that so
sorry to disappoint you but that's just
my opinion no you're good I appreciate
it
Chris all right morl have a good day
I you to see it see it yeah can you hear
and see me okay perfectly all right so
the the company is deep cognition which
I had mentioned that's a Dallas based
company and they started out with
something called Deep Learning Studio
which is uh a development platform for
AI and more important importantly was
the thing was the flexibility so we
talked about like generating videos
potentially from different images or
from video to to customize the video and
build make like a composite video out of

[46:01]
build make like a composite video out of
images or or image video combination and
not only that we we down the line we're
thinking we can make it where you can
customize it sir do you want to sell
videos to these mom and poop businesses
or the video making software to them the
video making software what would be the
like the revenue size of a a traditional
business that you think you would sell
these to so these are right now we're
doing we're targeting like Mom and Pops
I don't know a couple million a year any
industry or are there IND you're
thinking of currently we're thinking
about restaurants and motels operators
and as I said we can customize it so if
it's or build on build more features as
time goes and depending on how much
traction we get so for example if it's a
restaurant and they have you can
integrate all sorts of functionalities
either even their web page or their
specials or everything if they want to
build a video make a video and then post
it on Instagram or reals or whatever
they need they whatever medium they use

[47:00]
they need they whatever medium they use
we can build on that so each business
will be different so yeah it's do you
think you could be able to build like a
bot that could go to their Google my
business profiles aggregate their
pictures and or reviews make a video out
of that for them and then send send it
to them yes as a way to Market do you
think that be possible I think so yes
actually we kind of we were thinking
ahead of those kinds of things I I think
it's possible okay yeah so here's yeah
that's what I would do I would find
someone maybe it's someone on your team
or maybe it's an offse virtual assistant
that could build some sort of a a bot or
a scraper that would go to a
geographical Market or forget geography
maybe just go to hotels and restaurants
like you're planning find the ones that
have a good amount of reviews and
pictures have it make them a video of
the reviews and pictures but I would do
it very strategically in that you plant
Easter eggs near the beginning of this
video such as let's say you only include

[48:02]
video such as let's say you only include
their one star reviews in the video okay
and it's it's kind of like you're
sending them a promotional video for
their own business to promote your
software but you're putting in things
that will make them want to respond to
you so it's kind of like a it's kind of
like the psychology of a viral tweet or
video or anything you've got to put
stuff in there that make people want to
comment or if you just make them this
perfectly edited gorgeous video they're
not likely to respond even to say thank
you but you put something in there that
stirs an emotion in them like they're
going to know they're going to remember
that onear review right right yeah and
it's going to make them feel some things
and okay y thank you but like why would
I want to promote this one star review I
think your software is buggy and no we
wanted to get your attention now you
have a conversation right and just be
transparent about that like would yeah
and then maybe you can even have a
backup video queued up to where when
they respond you can automatically
respond with the real thing here's more

[49:01]
respond with the real thing here's more
what the final product looks like and
then if you can build a bot to do that
at scale holy cow you could even text
them a link to the video with this bot
to the number in the Google my business
profile only if it's a cell phone number
yeah that's what I would do if I were
you and then play around with the p
pricing play around with all that but I
think that could be a super scalable
like growth hack to help you grow
correct makes a lot of sense yeah yeah
man let me know if you try it and how it
goes sure sure I will yeah okay thanks
Jay thank you it was good talking yep
see you see you Clint that looks like a
man who lives in Alaska okay good glad
you can hear me this time all
right hey thanks thanks for taking my
call absolutely so where in Alaska are
you Anchorage oh man what okay what part
are you like in Anchorage proper or in
one of like Palmer areas oh you're

[50:00]
one of like Palmer areas oh you're
Alaska I'm in Anchorage Palmer or
Anchorage proper okay cool we went there
20 minut from downtown okay yeah I love
Alaska I'm a total Fanboy of the state
yeah me too it sounds like you're doing
all kinds of cool Alaskan small business
stuff so why don't you tell us like a
brief background of what you're doing
and then of what your question is yeah
so I work full-time here for uh Credit
Union and my wife and I we also do a few
side businesses we do Airbnb we live in
a duplex so we do Airbnb we do turo and
my wife also does an e-commerce business
a skincare business with
Shopify and we have decided that neither
of those are it we don't really like
them we so we're looking for kind of a
business idea to go all in on to scale
to the point where can quit my full-time
job and so that's kind of where we're at

[51:01]
job and so that's kind of where we're at
and the question is we love so we're
trying to find a business idea we love
Alaska and it's largely
underserved we know that we want to do a
business around Alaska but at the same
time we know that it's not our forever
home so that kind of creates a dilemma
and so I have a few ideas of business is
that we could do here um so hoping to
get your idea or your thoughts on those
as well as any ideas that you just have
naturally thinking of Alaska and what
could be
successful okay so if you were to rank
all of your current businesses where
would you rank them from most loved to
least turo would be most
loved then Shopify would be medium and
then Airbnb would be the lowest okay and
I think Airbnb because it's house
hacking and we don't sharing our
property with others yeah and turo is

[52:01]
property with others yeah and turo is
nice because I I assume the demand's
good you drop off the car there's very
little hassles most of the time and you
just you make good money yeah do you
have one car on turo we do yeah and what
is how quote occupied does it stay
the during the summer it's nearly like
80% 90%
and then during the winter we actually
pull it because it's too much of a
liability getting parked on the street
with snow and there's a lot of like
windshield damage during the Spring and
fall Seasons so that's another reason
why we're like type what type of car car
is it so we had a Chevy Traverse and we
sold that last year and we're looking to
buy a Kia Telly R for this year okay
what were you in the middle of saying
that's another reason why you're trying
to oh another reason is it's it is
lucrative but it's very much a it's like

[53:00]
lucrative but it's very much a it's like
only 3 months or cuz we only do it
during the
summer I ass I assume if you scaled this
up let's say you could wave a magic wand
and have 10 of these and they stayed 80%
occupied you'd have probably have to
store them somewhere in the offseason
yeah okay for that
yeah okay do you have any idea of how
popular the Traverse is on turo in your
local area compared to other makes
models just types of vehicles cars
trucks vans Etc I
don't I haven't looked into that okay
but it is an older vehicle and that's
kind of our thought of why we sold it
and we're going to looking to buy a
newer vehicle because newer is more
desired yeah and what do you what did
the Traverse rent for and what are you
planning on renting the the tell you
ride for on average per day last year
the Traverse sold or rented for for
roughly $150 to $180 a day uh during

[54:02]
roughly $150 to $180 a day uh during
peak season and then the tell you ride
we're anticipating probably closer to
230 to 250 a day and what percentage
does turo take right now we have it set
for
10% because we don't pay for as much of
the their
insurance okay so let's say the tell you
ride and what is the tell you ride going
to cost
35,000 okay so is it is the season three
months is that safe to say or could it
be even longer yeah it's usually May
through August are the peak Seasons so I
think that's
four okay so let's say let's be more
conservative and say that your toride
rents for 220 and then let's knock off
10% and call it 200 and then let's call
it four months that's 120 days at 80%

[55:00]
it four months that's 120 days at 80%
occupancy so let's see that's going to
be 19,000 a season so that's pretty
crazy obviously you're going to have
some cost but they're filling up the gas
you got to pay for insurance and then I
would just kind of work in the storage
even though you don't have to store this
one so 19 Grand a season theoretically
on paper for this tell you ride that
costs 35 Grand so your payoff is two
years right yeah and then okay here's
what I would do I used to do this with
Airbnb I would spend two or three hours
in turo in Anchorage in Alaska running
searches open a Google sheet and I I did
this with RVs once and I'll share you my
format with you after this open a Google
sheet and start running searches in
Anchorage at different dates like try
and always do I assume weekends are are
busier so I would do like a weekend in

[56:00]
busier so I would do like a weekend in
early May and then a weekend in early
June and then a weekend in early July
and then August and then even September
just see and run searches for everything
no filters set and then just put in your
sheet how many results what types of
results make it as granular or as broad
as you want and then I would start
writing some filters like maybe SUV only
maybe three years or newer only or
certain amount of Miles only your
four-wheel drive only whatever you kind
of want to lean into and then start
running those same searches on a date
much sooner right so compare like a
weekend in August verse a weekend in
early May at the start of the Season or
next weekend and what you can do with
this you you can do this on RV share or
Airbnb this will tell you how popular
certain models are or not how much
demand there is or not oh also put down
the the price of the average rental

[57:00]
the the price of the average rental
price for these filters it's going to
take it's going to take a little bit but
I would recommend you do it yourself and
not Outsource it because it'll be worth
your time and I'm only recommending all
this because you told me that of
everything you're doing you like turo
the best and then I would seriously look
into scaling it's late March if you were
to get two or three vehicles Now's the
Time to do it and look into like there
are people that make millions of dollars
a year on turo and I think you're in a
market that like when we went to Alaska
we used turo right the cars were insane
and it was we went to Hawaii we used
turo and I don't know what the
competitive landscape is but my gut is
if you had a an fairly easy time renting
out your Traverse 80 to 90% of the time
and that was a little older then a
better vehicle will do even better right
and I would start pricing out some
storage facilities and just baking that

[58:00]
storage facilities and just baking that
into your projections and then make a
different Google sheet that just says
okay let's say I have two cars or three
or four or five or just one and put them
in a Google sheet and then have a master
number that says what if I'm at 10%
occupancy worst case what do I do what
if I'm at 40 50 80 90 100% And then just
kind of come up with a framework based
on hard data this isn't guessing this
isn't just like wishful thinking based
on on a spreadsheet that you're this is
a spreadsheet forecasting based on hard
data in on turo that probably no one in
Anchorage is doing right now no one else
yeah and then you can learn wow this is
exactly what I did so I'm recommending
something that I literally did myself I
did this on RV share I wanted to buy an
RV for my family but I also wanted to
rent it out on the side and it was clear
as day to me that Class C RVs Northeast
Dallas Fort Worth were a super hot
commodity and it got to the point where

[59:00]
commodity and it got to the point where
I even got on the phone with one of the
co-founders or VPS and I showed him my
spreadsheet and he was super curious and
interested that some nerd did all this
research and I'm like hey can I ask you
and and it was in his best interest to
talk to me because I said I think I just
learned something about my local market
that really makes me want to buy a ton
of RVs and put them on RV share but I'd
like to talk to you first so we got on
the and I shared it with him and he's
holy cow it's you're in my like the back
end of our database this is exactly
right yeah he I wish I could shout it
from the rooftop people need to buy
Class C RVs not just efw but they were
hot in a lot of different places and
especially there's more nuances like you
don't want that you don't want one
that's too long because then people will
be intimidated but if it's too short
then it's too small for families and I
was able to figure that out even like
the length of the RV and so once I
figured that out it was like wow yeah
I'm off to the races so I bought an RV
and it was like a 2008 it was I don't

[1:00:02]
and it was like a 2008 it was I don't
know I've boughten sever I bought
several RVs so I don't remember which
one this was but the payback period on
this thing was like three months which
is similar to what you're looking at
yeah and I I did a tweet on this because
it was like Hey I'm shouting this from
the rooftops you could start a really
scalable business on RV share and
outdoorsy and there's three other
platforms now the problem is you're in
like you have one turo and so the fact
that this is your favorite initiative
right now is really saying something
because that's hard like I've always
said if if you're GNA have one rental
house you might as well have a 100 and
if you will have one turo you might as
well have a 100 because you're in that
it's just it's hard that's a hard
business when you only have one car so I
would do that research and figure out is
can my market support five more cars or
10 more cars and where do I put them in
the offseason how much is that a cost
and then just work that offseason
storage and insurance cost into your

[1:01:01]
storage and insurance cost into your
calculations
okay so you wouldn't even think about
doing something different I would do
this research before making that
decision okay and maybe you could even
do this research and then come back and
talk in a week or two and tell me what
you think and then we can talk about
another business because I know better
than anyone that other businesses are
hard and other businesses are always
sexier The Grass Is Always Greener
but if you already have this it's
already profitable you already like it
then find out if it's scale enough
scalable enough there before making the
decision about something totally
different that makes
sense so yeah good luck man I want to
hear how it goes okay sounds good thanks
Chris yep no problem see you bye cool I
guess that concludes episode seven I
think this is of the ker office thank
you for listening or watching and I
we'll see you next week
