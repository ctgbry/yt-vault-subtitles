[00:00]
um okay yeah sorry yeah we're good we're
good so you are tiffany yes okay um I
want to hear everything you got going on
and thank you for coming on by the way
thank you for having me absolutely we
don't get very many female callers so I
always love it when we do oh awesome
yeah so what what are you dealing with
um yes so I bought a
business last summer um um and it was I
was looking for a business for a while
like probably a few years and I ended up
with this one that I bought um it was
supposed to replace the income of my
current job that pays very well um and
just because I'm in like corporate and
I'm trying to get out of like big
corporate um so it was supposed to
replace my income I did all the due
diligence I had a lawyer I had an

[01:01]
diligence I had a lawyer I had an
accountant I had a broker um it was you
did everything right yeah we were also
going through the SBA so the SBA did all
their due diligence for months like we
did due diligence for a very long time
um and the day after the closing of the
business we found out that pretty much
everything the previous owner told us
was a lie um so the day after the
closing of the business um there was
supposed to be like seven employees the
day after the closing of the business he
told me there was no employees anymore
they walked out months ago he never told
us he oh my gosh um he even gave us like
documents like he gave my accountant
documents saying like here is all the
employees their salary their job titles
their start date like this is how many
hours a week they work and this was all

[02:00]
hours a week they work and this was all
after they all walked out on him and he
didn't tell us um and was this real
quick were you not able to validate this
because he was saying something like I
don't want to Spook the employees so I'd
rather you not meet them until after
close was that kind of his and that's
that's a normal reason right like that
shouldn't even be a r flag to you right
so when I originally went to the
business so we were doing due diligence
for so long it was I believe we started
in February and the closing of the
business wasn't until August so I was we
were when I originally went to go see
the business all the employees were
there they were working everything
looked smooth and well-run and it was
fine and then I went another time like a
month or two later everyone was still
there so I thought everything was fine
and then he a couple months later he
gave us all the documents for the
employees said that they still work
there and we didn't know a month before
that they walked out um so then that was
just the tip of it that was when it
started the day after and then the day

[03:00]
started the day after and then the day
after like it was officially closed and
then I said to him well I like you need
to hire new people like I bought a
business with seven employees and he was
like oh no I'm not gonna hire anyone
like you need to do that and I'm like
how am I gonna do that when you didn't
train me yet so I don't even know I
don't know anything yeah I like and that
was the other thing like when we first
the day after closing when we had our
meeting it was like the It was supposed
to like start training that day like
virtu
and the very first thing he said to me
was okay so what do you want to know and
I was like um everything like what do
you mean and he was like yeah but like
you don't need to know everything right
like just like just like name some
things you want to know about and I was
like no like you need to show me how to
run the whole business like that's what
you're getting paid for now so like show
me how to run the business and he just
like didn't have anything planned he
didn't know what to tell me and then I
found out there was no employees because
I was like okay I was like I guess if
you want to start somewhere I guess I

[04:00]
you want to start somewhere I guess I
need to figure out how to pay the
employees so how do you pay the
employees he's like oh there's no
employees anymore and I was like what
when were you it's one thing if that
happened like the day before right like
word leaked but six months yeah like no
he literally told us like multiple times
that all the employees were there they
were running the business everything was
great and they were not there that whole
time so can you tell me like the
industry like to help provide some
context I'd love to know like the
average like the just a range of Revenue
or profit that at least that you
expected and the industry and like a
rough geography and be as broad as you
like yeah so it's placed in New Jersey
it is a custom merch like promotional
product business um and he claimed that
he the revenue was
$750,000 so mind you he gave us all
these p&l statements and and like the
accountants went over it the SBA went
over it the banks went over it and

[05:01]
over it the banks went over it and
everything looked fine and then I like
obviously the day after closing you're
not going to realize how much revenue is
coming in or out um so it was probably
like a couple weeks after and then my
accountant like did the first month of
the p&l statements and he was like and
he like sent it to me I'm like this
doesn't look right I was like why is
this so much lower than what his always
was and he was like
we went through it multiple times like
this is what you brought in and this is
like everything and it was and they were
they were reconciling with the bank and
like they had all the info they needed
yep and they he
basically so he when he so he didn't
show me how to use anything I basically
had to figure it all out on my own and I
hired three I was able to find three
employees that came on and he basically
didn't train them either like we all had

[06:00]
didn't train them either like we all had
to figure things out on our own
and um he when he all he did was set my
email up to replace his email so that if
anyone emailed him it would just go
right to me and I guess he didn't
realize that that means I would also
have access to his old emails so I
found emails from him and his accountant
that like his accountant sent him the
p&l statements to send us and were not
the same p&l statements he sent us he
changed them yeah the p&l statements
directly from his accountant were very
in the negative and he the ones he sent
us were very in the positive so now what
did he change them from
two so like what what were they when the
account what were they actually versus
what did he show you so I don't have the
numbers right in front of me just a
rough estimate so he sent us in June he
sent us the first half of the year for
well I guess it was July he sent us

[07:01]
well I guess it was July he sent us
January to June from last year and he
said that the cash flow like after
paying all the employees after taking
his salary like all
expenses it was positive like
$300,000 and
then that's what he sent us and then
when I found the one from the accountant
after all expenses it was like negative
$50,000 oh my goodness yeah and then it
wasn't even a sellable business I mean
right not at all and then probably like
a couple weeks in I found out that he
sold equipment that was supposed to be
included and then I started getting all
these calls from vendors that he didn't
pay so because their all the employees
walked out he had to start Outsourcing
everything and so a lot of the customers
he just was ignoring he wasn't even
answering he was kind of just like well
I'm selling it in a couple weeks so like
he just wasn't being bothered but then

[08:00]
he just wasn't being bothered but then
some of them he was Outsourcing and then
he never paid those vendors to for the
work that they did so then they were
reaching out to me like you need to pay
this like you already got the stuff and
then it was a lot of stuff like he sold
equipment there was no employees he lied
about the
revenue um I literally haven't this was
supposed to replace the income from my
current job and now I'm working
full-time at my current job and running
this business and I haven't taken one
penny from the business and we're
negative every single month and I like
we're the business is running off of
credit cards and that interest is like
building up and we're at like yeah the
bare minimum of employees because or
else the business won't run like I have
someone making the product I have
someone who's like helping the customers
and everything and then someone who does
like the graphic design stuff and all
that like I can't get rid of any of them
really and that's the only other way I

[09:00]
really and that's the only other way I
can really cut Revenue right now like I
got new vendors that are a little bit
cheaper
um I like raised prices a little bit but
I can only raise them so much without
people thinking we're absolutely insane
um yeah and I just like don't know what
else to do like that interest is really
racking up on the yeah credit cards and
we are in the middle of a lawsuit um
against him but that takes a long time
um and like I I've been keep putting my
own personal money into it every month
and I can't even quit my job take over
the employees positions because one I
wasn't trained on anything and two
they're were still negative so like I
the only it wouldn't make sense I
wouldn't be able to take their income
anyway yeah so let first of all you got
the lwuit going which was great we won't
even talk about that because you're
already working on that what are your
like what are your options like what
would you prefer to do
um in a in a perfect world if you could

[10:01]
um in a in a perfect world if you could
turn this around you know because you've
got like run away you've got hide you've
got get a job you've got shut it all
down declare bankruptcy you've got turn
it around grow it paid marketing like
what do you want to do and what what do
you think are the options in front of
you the most realistic ones yeah so I've
tried to do some marketing but again
like I can only do so much because we're
already negative so I can't put out a
ton of money on that um ideally like
obviously I would want to make what he
told me I was making so I could replace
my income
um I I don't know I think like so I have
talked to the lawyer about bankruptcy
but we're trying to go through with the
court dates and all the lawsuit before
we actually go through with that to see
if it's
necessary
um I just like don't see how it's like
realistic to raise the revenue that much
in the amount of time that we would need
it to be raised that much um so if you

[11:01]
it to be raised that much um so if you
if you can't then what do you think
you'll have to
do I so and then let's talk about how
you might be able to yeah so I so right
now I'm just kind of waiting for the
court dates and the lawsuit um and say
like that doesn't go in my favor for
whatever reason I don't really see how
it can't but say it doesn't I think like
my only option would be to try to
like sell the business and who's going
want it I mean the only thing I'm
thinking is like if I sell it to another
similar business that might want like
the equipment and the customers that we
do have um and they would have to get
rid of their employees because they're
going to already have employees but it's
not gonna like someone who's not in the
industry isn't going to buy the business
when it's negative um yeah are are you
able in the chat here to message me the
domain name and I I'll keep it private I
would really like to look at at the
website just to see exactly what you
do where is it chat

[12:08]
yep how do I it's not letting me do
it you could even email it to me if you
want let me email it's not letting me do
it for some reason maybe I have to I
just messaged you did you see it come
through is there a notification or
anything oh there we go got it
yeah so I sent you the all right there
it is yep and then
um so yeah I don't unless like there's a
company who would want to do like a
merger
um so is it is it screen printing mostly
yeah or just C custom merch so yeah it's
like specialized in screen printing
apparel but we do everything embroidery

[13:02]
apparel but we do everything embroidery
um we can do pens postcards literally
anything and what's up with the two
locations
here so yeah that's the other thing
that's a little sketchy so it is just in
Jersey he claimed that he was opening
another location at the other one
and it turns out like he wasn't he was
just making that up and then he also
claimed that he was franchising it and
then we found out that also wasn't true
um yeah so that other location does not
exist it's we keep trying to take it off
and there's like issues with the website
but it is just the one location how long
had he been in business and how did he
acquire the customers that he has so
that's the so mind you I'm just getting
this from him and he hasn't been
truthful about 95% of the stuff so this
is just what I'm hearing from him um it
was he started it in 2018 and apparently
he did no marketing or anything he just

[14:03]
he did no marketing or anything he just
it was like Word of Mouth his dad is
kind of in the same industry so his dad
I guess kind of got him customers um and
that's the other like there his dad is
kind of well known in the area and
that's the other thing both of
them like his dad has a radio station
and his dad like went on the radio
talking about it like all these lies
and the old owner also went on all his
social media like trying to like defend
himself I'm like we literally haven't
gone public about this at all so like I
don't know why you feel the need to do
this yeah but and he would say like the
business name and like everything and I
guess like trying to I don't know what
he's trying to do but that's also like
now involved in the court case for
defamation and everything too yeah so he
claims he he launched in 2018 it's
always just been kind of organic
as far as acquiring customers goes

[15:02]
as far as acquiring customers goes
that's kind of how he framed it yeah I
mean he told us there was no marketing
so there was plenty of room to grow and
all this stuff but I'm not sure how
accurate that is anymore yeah and what
does your average customer look like how
much are they spending is it a school is
it a you know what type of person is it
yeah so we do quite a few schools and um
like recreation centers who that work
with like team sports and stuff
um and then we do businesses a lot of
businesses like Landscaping um
construction workers stuff like that and
then we'll also do like smaller things
where people just want like a sweatshirt
for their grandson or something um but
most of our stuff is like bigger
businesses like ice cream shops
construction places Landscaping schools
stuff like that okay and have you been
able to when did you close again like
when did this all go
down last August

[16:00]
down last August
okay so you've been at this for a while
then yeah so you started in February of
2023 due diligence lasted six months
closed in August found out about all
this in August and you've just been like
trying to keep your head above water
yeah ever since so I'm looking at the
web Archive of his domain name and it
looks like it was launched in
2023 um 20121 it was a parked domain uh
early 2000s the domain was used for like
a tattoo shop
um it but like TW Fe I mean there's
there was nothing indexed on the website
in 2022 for this for this business which
is very rare um yeah un I don't know
unless he just I don't know why he would
just start the website right before he
put it up for
sale I guess it did
then honestly it looks like he did um
I'm looking at who is.com
the UR the URL on who who is.com and it

[17:02]
the UR the URL on who who is.com and it
uh so registered on in
2021 so like it looked like this domain
was active in the early 2000s someone
let it expire it was registered again at
the very end of 20121 so basically
2022 and then like it wasn't really
people weren't really doing anything
with it until 2022 and then 2023 is when
Google started indexing it uh and it
back then it look like what it looks
like now but it looks like he just built
this as a front to sell it like as a FR
it seems like what we've been like
finding is that like he seemed it seemed
like he right before he listed it
he kind of like put all these things in
place to make it look more legit than it
was
yeah how how many customers do you
have um it's so hard to say

[18:04]
um so probably like a weekly basis we
might have like five to 10 customers on
a weekly
basis okay some of them repeat some of
them
not and what is your monthly Revenue
nowadays um let me bring that up it's
very because it is a very
um like seasonal so like right now is
our slower season because it's summer so
like schools aren't doing anything um so
it does vary so let me see what last
month brought us
in are any drugs involved with this
seller like is he like addicted gambling
or do you know of anything like

[19:01]
or do you know of anything like
that not that I know of but I
mean I mean I guess anything's possible
at this
point so my guess is like you said his
dad's in the industry they probably know
the industry really well they speak the
language I bet you anything that he
started this business with the intent of
it actually being a business launch
didn't really go well he cobbled
together some customers he didn't like
what the numbers look like and then just
being completely uncaring psychopath
sociopath just lied faked everything he
could to get some money out of it um and
then was just totally cool lying to
anyone about anything because he saw six
figures coming into his bank account in
the near future yeah um so last month it
was the revenue was
28,000 um I'll check the month before
just so we can get like a kind of better
idea

[20:06]
and then the month
before was the owner's owner's name
start with a B
yes um the month before was like
30,000 so I guess around that this time
of year and what are your margins
like so
that's as in terms of like our expenses
like our cost of
goods um so that's let me see what it
said for last
month so last
month our total cost of goods sold
was 9700
okay so like 65% gross margins give or

[21:03]
okay so like 65% gross margins give or
take so 30 grand Topline 10 grand bottom
line or sorry 30 grand Top Line 10 grand
in cogs
basically uh I guess so
yeah okay so then like out of that 20
grand left you're paying employees I
imagine you have your expensive rent
overhead Etc yeah okay yeah and then we
have to pay like the vendor
um like monthly cost and then um we have
like a graphic design service that's
like pretty expensive monthly um yeah
all of
that so how much is 10,000 a month
minimum okay wow okay so that's half
your gross profit how much are you
paying the graphic design company they
are 2,000 a
month and it's like an agency yes how
many different like designs are you
making are you having them make every

[22:00]
making are you having them make every
month um so it's our package is like 50
a month um and we've never really gone
over it so it's around like 50 a month
50 designs for
$2,000 yeah okay and that's like a state
side
agency
um I think it's like
Nationwide well like sorry uh like de
it's not a virtual assistant it's a
us-based company yeah okay I would see
if you can find someone on upwork to do
it um like on a per design basis um I
mean I get my I get my thumbnails
designed on YouTube for $7 each pretty
good um I think you could really cut at
least, dollar a month that might not
sound like a lot but it's something yeah
um is is there an option to where you
could find a bigger competitor that is
doing literally a hundred times the
volume of you and they have much lower
cost and you can just sub everything out

[23:01]
cost and you can just sub everything out
to them and just keep your business
going but like fire your employees just
be like not have overhead not have rent
and just basically I mean this is a
common model in the screen printing
industry anyway just sub everything out
just be the marketing and the sales arm
is that
viable um I mean yeah so we have like
a place who does like our bigger stuff
now that like we can't handle in house
um so I guess I could like out Out
Source everything through them but my
only concern with that is we have to
every time we do Outsource so then we
have to raise our prices just to cover
cost and so that I can cover some of the
expenses that we have
and
um we already like lose some customers
when we raise our cost um but I mean I
guess if I I can't get rid of all the
employees because I wouldn't be able to
handle that work workload and work my

[24:00]
handle that work workload and work my
job um
yeah so you still have your full-time
job yes okay what has your lawyer said
about like going public about this or
talking about this um he definitely like
advised against
it
okay what about talking to your
customers transparently about this
situation and like pleading your cause
to
them so my concern about that
is so some of them don't even seem to
realize that he sold the business and a
lot of them seem to have only been
getting from like purchasing from the
business because they know his dad
and so I don't know if we start saying
things about the previous owner they're
going to be like well I don't want to be
involved because I'm friends with his
dad so right I mean do this there's no
way this guy would even have this
business if it weren't for his dad it

[25:00]
business if it weren't for his dad it
sounds like oh there yeah there's no way
so his daddy just like fed him these
leads and he's like all right you start
a business son and then he screwed it up
and he's like he just sold it and it's
literally in the same building that
we're in and he's right next to us so
it's very awkward now yeah and his dad
definitely like doesn't want to hear our
side and he's like just listens to all
the lies of his son's feeding him and
it's very awkward now yeah I'm sorry
H how much of a like how much term do
you have left on your lease oh it's a
fiveyear lease
so five how much is Left four years in
like a month and how much is your rent
per month
2,000 okay and then we had to and then
the loan for the SBA was 4,000 a month
and we kind of put that on pause
thankfully they were understanding for
the time being because we could not
afford it like at all um I was paying

[26:01]
afford it like at all um I was paying
that out of my pocket every single month
and like I have my own bills to pay like
I have a mortgage on my house and
everything um yeah so luckily they put
that on pause until the lawsuit but if
again if we don't win the lawsuit I'm
gonna have to start paying that back
yeah okay well I I look at this as you
having two options right now um I've
I've been involved with lawsuits with
business partners too and they were both
Terri
um just just terrible one of them ended
okay financially the other one did not
um you can't just and I know you know
this but you can't just wait it out
right and I know you're running the
business and you're doing everything you
can but I feel like you've either got to
go hard like just jump in both feet and
that doesn't necessarily mean quit your
job because I don't want you to do that
but I feel like you just need to grab
this by the horns and take some courses
uh learn like because the good thing for
you is the merch business the screen
printing business is very common and

[27:01]
printing business is very common and
there's a lot of really smart courses
out there about how to grow how to
acquire customers how to be creative how
to do print on demand how to partner
with thirdparty logistics companies that
sell t-shirts they don't want to print
them and you can print them and they can
ship them or vice versa um I I feel like
you you could do a lot in the way of
learning Google and Facebook ads um take
a $50 course follow some YouTubers and
really just try to grow hard while you
wait for this lawsuit to play out
because if you don't do that then it's
just going to languish and languish and
shrink and shrink and shrink and shrink
and shrink and your problems will get
worse so I feel like either you need to
go all in both feet with learning how to
grow this business or you need to just
sever it like today and just cut ties
and walk away from the lease and just
swallow it and just be done with it um
or else your life is just going to be a
living hell right yeah
what do you think about that um I mean

[28:02]
what do you think about that um I mean
like I want to like give it a chance and
like get it to where he said it was um
and I have done some marketing like
we've gone to like events and like we've
put like ads out um like small
Billboards and like at
like and like in newsletters and
newspapers and like we on on social
media
um but I mean I guess I could definitely
I just don't we just can't afford to put
like a lot of money into them um and
that's like the only issue
um I mean I would definitely love to
grow it and then it would work out but
if it can't grow significantly and like
probably by like the end of the year
like I'm going to have
to probably sell it or
something okay um here's what I think

[29:01]
something okay um here's what I think
you should do with regards to Growing it
I think you should look at all your
customers I think you should do a bunch
of market research on your competitors
and find out what type of customer is
the best customer maybe it's a high
school sports team maybe it's an HVAC
business I have no idea restaurant I
don't know find out that like 10 to 20
different industries that make for
really repeat high volume customers um
and then I want you to go to outscar
and it costs like $5 and I want you to
scrape hundreds or thousands of those
types of customers it's very easy I've
got tutorials online I'm happy to send
you a link afterwards um and then and
I'll show you how to do all this so it's
going to sound maybe overwhelming but I
I'll email you all this info um and then
you want to scrub out all the landlines
um and then you want to send them a mass
text that to the business owner um and I
was doing this yesterday not for
t-shirts of course but but for something
else and it works amazingly and just say

[30:00]
else and it works amazingly and just say
hey uh this is my name uh here's where I
am I I I just bought this business and I
would tell them like I would tell them
in a general way like I'm in a really
tough spot due to something that is not
my fault and I'm trying to grow my way
out of it um and just pitch them that
story like I know you're buying t-shirts
I would love to have your next order um
is there anything you can do like can I
10 shirts 10 hats 50 hats 100 hats like
I think you'll really be surprised our
quality our prices yada y y I'll hand
deliver it um what do you think now
there's a strategic way to give that
pitch that's not like your first text I
would start the text by qualifying them
saying hey do you still own XY or Z
business um and then just try to like
tell them your story it's a unique story
right like you can use that negative
occurrence to your advantage um you
don't want to go shout it from the roof
rooftops because you don't want to get
counter sued or whatever yeah um but you
can tell them that you're dealing with
something really tough right now um due

[31:02]
something really tough right now um due
to something that is outside of your
control and um I mean you're selling a
commodity right and so usually that's
looked at as a negative use that as a
positive right like oh we're just
selling a commodity so it's a it's a
race to the bottom no we're we're
selling a commodity which means everyone
buys it right everyone buys my thing and
so uh they're either gonna buy it from
me or from someone else so you've need
you need to have at least if not a
better story than someone El else a
different story um that's from the heart
and I I know that some people will
resonate with it it's just a numbers
game maybe it's 1% maybe it's 30% um but
you've got to put a lot more Hooks In
The Water right yeah you've got to put
put yourself out there and your story
out there um as much as will not you
know get you Su yeah so I me and I have
the employees doing it every single day
reaching out to businesses but we
haven't tried
that method of just
like kind of being honest about why we

[32:02]
like kind of being honest about why we
need to raise the revenue um I mean I
won't be like fully transparent about
all the details but um yeah we could
definitely try that method and yeah I
would definitely if you could send me
that information on how to
do um use that website I would
definitely start it today I will
absolutely do that thank you yeah I'm
sorry Tiffany and that's that sucks I've
been there but like I just know you're
going to look back on this and you're
going to I would not be here if I
weren't ever there right and that was
terrible and there were no there was no
good way out of that that but because of
that I learned this and now I'm here and
I wouldn't have changed anything right
it's like impossible to see that right
now if someone would have told me that
when I was in the do rooms I would have
said get out of my face don't talk to me
right but like it's true like I like
it's the most cliche thing ever but
everything happens for reasons like
multiple reasons like not just one not
just because this is going to lead you

[33:00]
just because this is going to lead you
to an awesome opportunity but a dozen
different things um and it sucks but
just take a long-term approach to it and
you're going to be more weathered you're
going to be more resilient uh and you're
going to this is going to force you to
learn skills that you never really
wanted to learn but that are really good
to learn and you'll be better off for it
but all that to be said I'm sorry like
it's terrible and it sucks and I've been
there thank you you're welcome well uh
you can email me anytime Chris
co-founders decom and and I'm happy to
happy to help thank you so much no
problem have a good day you too bye
bye all right uh that was rough thank
you um Tiffany we got
Michael Michael how we doing good how
are you good it is good to talk to you
let me let me pull up my notes so
all right so tools to yeah why don't you

[34:01]
all right so tools to yeah why don't you
ask me your question I've got something
here but I let's hear it from the
horse's mouth so to
speak yeah no problem uh I was just uh
wondering you
know uh how do people evaluate
whether whatever the business is if if
that opportunity is saturated in a
particular area or if there's
opportunity like whether it be I don't
know an ice cream store or a independent
pack and ship store you know like how
how do you how do you find out whether
there's an opportunity in a given
area great question so are you able to
say what you're looking to do so my
advice can be more
specific um you know the independent
packing Ship Store is uh is a kind of
what I had in mind but um yeah I've I've
sorted through different business ideas
and like for a while I was searching for
land for self storage facilities and I
know there was like a uh kind of a tool

[35:00]
know there was like a uh kind of a tool
that um those kind of people use to find
something like
this yeah they have a lot of tools out
there so what about the pack and ship uh
business model do you
love um I like that it's uh relatively
cheap to start for me um you know 50
$60,000 I think gets the job done um uh
and rather easy to scale out of it um is
my
understanding yeah and where where are
you located
Indianapolis okay what type of market
research have you done already and is
that where you feel like you have to or
want to open or are you flexible to
moving um I'm open to moving um
basically I kind of just tried to you
know look myself you know where where do
these stores currently exist and um kind
of get get a feel for how how many of
them there are um and I mean maybe I

[36:02]
them there are um and I mean maybe I
could take that and compare it to
different areas but um yeah it's just
kind of anecdotal experience at this
point I would say
yeah are you there yeah sorry um I I am
here but I I think it
paused oh yeah I was asking like what
what first gave you the idea to to start
and you're looking to start a pack and
ship store not um not uh buy one
right um yeah correct I mean possibly
looking for either but um yeah I guess
I've just been interested in starting a
business and I'm not sure how I know a
little bit about your background how you
became interested in the cleaning um but
kind of these things just seem to be
populating on my Twitter feed honestly

[37:02]
populating on my Twitter feed honestly
you know cleaning remote cleaning
business uh pack and ship store you know
um
so all right so I'll tell you how how
you can find out if it's saturated or
not um and then I'll I'll tell you
something else so if I were you I would
go to use outscar
I would find a city very comparable so
let's do this I'm going to go to chat
GPT right now what city is
comparable in
culture density and size in the US
too so I'm asking Chad GPT what cities
in the US are comparable in like average
income
population um Etc to Indianapolis so
Columbus Ohio very similar population
similar size similar cultures obviously
their neighboring states um so let's do

[38:02]
their neighboring states um so let's do
this so I would go to Columbus Ohio and
I would go to use
outracing feature and for Columbus and
all of the outlying um suburbs because
the way it works is it's by City And so
if you just type in Columbus then you're
only going to get pack and ship stores
in Columbus proper but you want to know
like the Greater Columbus area because
you want to know about the greater
Indianapolis area and so I would run a
scrape it'll just it'll cost 10 bucks
take an hour um and then you're going to
get a spreadsheet of stores I would
remove all of the all of the results
that are not relevant right you're going
to get a FedEx store Ah that's not a
competitor you're going to get um you
know uh Staples or whatever take all
those out and just look for independent
pack and ship stores okay then you want

[39:00]
pack and ship stores okay then you want
to find the ZIP code that they are in
and then go to Google and and get a list
and I've done this before of populations
by ZIP code and you want to place those
populations next to the ZIP codes in
your spreadsheet so then you can say all
right how many stores per person per zip
code and then you want to find a
Baseline and then you you you got to
take it a step further because you're if
you're going to spend 50 or $60,000 you
really really really got to do research
so this is like phase four and then you
go in and you say all right okay now I
know which zip codes have the most
stores per capita not just the most most
stores but per capita and then you want
to know the demographics of those zip
codes so then there's like a website
that's like usstate dat or citystate
dat.com you want to know which zip codes
have like what their crime levels are um
what their average incomes are what
their uh population density is all of
these apps attributes bunch of columns
in the same spreadsheets uh and try to

[40:01]
in the same spreadsheets uh and try to
figure it out okay try to figure out
like what a what a good Baseline is for
a sister city to Indianapolis and then
you're going to take it a step further
then you're going to say okay based on
this data it looks like um these three
ZIP codes in Columbus are undersaturated
for pack and ship Stores um so then
you're going to get them on the phone
all of them and you're going to say
you're going to pretend like you're a
customer and say say hey like I'm
looking for a mailbox or yada y yada try
to ask questions and use chat GPT to
help generate more questions try to ask
questions that give you a feel uh for
their volume and be as bold as you want
because who cares like if you're going
to offend some guy why you being nosy
about my business who cares you're never
going to talk to him again they're a
stayed away um and so just start brewing
down with them and you know you have any
mailboxes what are your hours what are
your costs get a bunch of data um and
get all that data on as many stores as
you can so now you're going to see all

[41:02]
you can so now you're going to see all
right hm zip codes with high crime are
actually more busy or zip codes with
high crime are less busy or zip codes
with a higher population density um are
more busy which makes sense um and try
to find holes in that market uh holes
being where you might be able to open a
store in Columbus if you were to want to
that would be the most likely to be
successful and then like phase six or
seven you're going to go read their
reviews okay you're going to go to the
web archive and you're going to go to
who is.com you're going to type in the
URLs of these stores how many of them
have websites look at the reviews when
was the first review how many years ago
was it so how New or Old were these
stores uh and this is going to take half
a day uh then you're GNA all this data
and then you will literally know more
about the pack and ship industry in
Columbus Ohio than anyone on the earth
over the course of a half a day which is
nerdy but cool um this is exactly what I
did when I opened my iPhone repair store

[42:01]
did when I opened my iPhone repair store
15 years ago the principles still apply
um and then we opened three more and we
did the same thing and all of them were
successful and we sold the business so
then you're going to take that data and
you have to make the assumption that
that same data is going to be true for a
city just a few hours away in a very
comparable State um and then you're
going to do all the same research and
then you're going to find you're going
to know by this point um what the
Baseline is okay in other words 50,000
people in a 1hour radius that make an
average of $40,000 a year that has a
crime rate of 4% or whatever it is
you're going to know with 70 80%
certainty that a store in that area um
will be
successful um and then you start looking
for real estate in that area um and when
you're negotiating a lease you want to
be sure that you have a short-term lease
with an option to extend because if this
thing doesn't work out you're going to
know within a year and you want to be

[43:01]
know within a year and you want to be
able to pull the plug in a year um
without being on the hook for four more
years of a
lease awesome that's fantastic advice
thank you yeah is that kind of what you
were looking for yeah absolutely um I
guess just any other thoughts on the
general pack and ship store you might
have I'd be of course open to well I I
know a bit about that industry because
I've been in the logistics industry I
don't really like that business that
much just because of the opportunity
cost of your time and money um I don't I
don't like retail businesses because I'm
an introvert and I don't like dealing
with customers maybe you're the opposite
um I don't like like I it's so maybe I'm
saying this because all I do for a
living is look at opportunities and
business ideas and so I'm pretty picky
right but most people don't right they
don't their their brain isn't sick and
hardwired in the wrong way like mine is
so most people get a few ideas and they
gravitate to one um and that's great but

[44:01]
gravitate to one um and that's great but
I if I had 50 or 60,000 to work with I
would rather start a service business
that doesn't have any overhead um a
gutter cleaning business a landscaping
business a tree triming business I'm
recommending what I know it doesn't mean
it's the the right option for you um
that's just that's a lot of money um you
could buy a small franchise for
$50,000 um so I also recommend that you
go to entrepreneur.com start beating on
all the franchises out there and see if
you can find a lowcost franchise that's
growing like crazy um that has really
good unit economics really good numbers
that is not in your area yet and start
looking seriously into
that awesome well uh thank you so much
you're welcome yeah let me know how it
goes I'm I'm excited for you either way
will this be available to view anywhere
yep it'll be on YouTube and my podcast
awesome thank you so much yep thanks
Michael see you

[45:03]
bye
Corey hey Chris how are you good how are
you
man I'm doing pretty good good thank you
for coming on um and as I understand it
you're curious about like a kayak rental
business yeah just that business model
in general I was intrigued by the tweet
that you posted and I had some ideas
about just that business model in
general um so I got tweet you posted so
let's hear them absolutely yeah so
there's you can buy those pods and
typically right now there's like these
pods are used you've probably seen the
Amazon pickup boxes or things like that
they're used at apartment complexes and
places like that but they also have the
ability to be used in other ways they're
just not I guess being used that way in
my current role we sell them to
apartment complexes but the manufacturer
has talked about wanting to find other

[46:00]
has talked about wanting to find other
ways to use those type of
PODS so my idea is there's two ways you
can take it you can put things in or you
can take things out so you can put
things in like uh at the gates of
baseball basketball football games
concerts anywhere that they have
restricted access for bag size so for
for example you go to the gate and
they're like oh your bag's not clear
it's too big it's whatever then you walk
over to a kiosk you rent u a thing for
$10 for example you put your bag in it
because I used to work the gate at
football games at University of Kentucky
and at those games we would have people
with like thousand Lou at Tom purses and
they would just hide them behind a bush
and hope they were there when they came
out of the game and then they would come
out of the game and security had dogs
going around the stadium the whole time
so anytime they found a bag they would
just pick it up and throw it away so
like there were thousands of dollars of
bags getting thrown away see I thought I
was crazy I went to uh the um the Six
Flags water park I forget the name of it
but we forgot our sunscreen and it was
like $23 for a bottle of sunscreen I was

[47:03]
like $23 for a bottle of sunscreen I was
so angry that's insane but we didn't
want to and all of the lockers were full
they had lockers they were full and
those were like $20 but I hid it I hid
the sunscreen in a bush and felt like a
mad man hiding $23 wor a sunscreen in a
bush I can't imagine a thousand
purse these would be like girls that
going into the game like college girls
and they would just be like oh I'll just
hide it and I'll come back and get it
and I'd be like it's not going to be
there and they're like well I'll take
the chance and then security would just
come around pick them all up and throw
them all away and I was like well I told
you that was going to happen so that's
one way places like that like already
have lockers like why doesn't the
stadium at University of Kentucky we
never did at UK yeah we never had
lockers I've been to other stadiums that
don't I've been to lot stadiums that do
but the nice part about these is they're
automated as well um like I went to a
Boston Red Sox game this summer or
earlier this year and they had like a
truck parked in the parking lot of some
third party company like a box truck
that just said store your stuff here and

[48:00]
that just said store your stuff here and
you just rented something from them I
didn't use it so I didn't go up to it
where was that at again and then in
Boston at a Red Sox game interesting and
then last year I went to a Nationals
game in May and they had like old gym
lockers rolled out and then they had
like people stand there working say walk
up you give them their stuff they'd go
put it in a locker for you and at the
end of the night you came back nice part
about these is they're automated so then
somebody could just type in a code find
Locker it pops open they put their stuff
in it close it and they access it with
the code when they come
back do you have any idea how much these
you know this truck or these old school
lockers are
charging I don't know I I didn't stop by
the truck just because it didn't click
with me until I got inside and then when
I came out it was like a mad rush to get
out of the place so um I haven't done
too much research on what they're
charging but I mean even if you charge
$10 a person if you take in 1% of 60,000
people that need it then it's you're
still making decent money so fans who

[49:02]
still making decent money so fans who
arrive I'm looking at the Fenway Parks
website to an entry gate for a game with
a non- permitting bag will have the
option of storing their bag for a fee
with a thirdparty locker company this
Locker Truck Yeah is located on top of
the lands down garage across from gate e
um so basically any bag bigger than 12 x
X6 yep yeah every stadium has you know
bag polish policies they have things in
place that need to like that sometimes
it's clear bag sometimes it's size it's
different by Stadium which makes it hard
but even airports you can do it in an
airport there's tons of people that go
through the TSA line they have things
they can't have they have to throw away
then you can get out line I went to an
airport once where they had a uh they
had like a a box where you could put
stuff in and then they would mail it
back home to you which I thought was an
interesting model I saw that that is an
interesting model I I'll ask you the the
obvious question sure there are already
pod I mean you work for one for pods or
Locker companies that that offer this

[50:00]
Locker companies that that offer this
why aren't they at at Fenway Park why
aren't they at UK
Stadium today I have no idea I haven't
attacked them that part of the model yet
since you know I started this role six
months ago we sell a wide variety of
equipment in the role I'm in that is
just one small piece of the puzzle and
not a piece that we push very heavily as
of right now um I've reached out to a
couple people that I used to work with
and then have begun having those
conversations on it's just something
they'd be interested in it's just trying
to find the right person because I
worked in ticketing so then you're
trying to work your way from ticketing
to operations and finding exactly who
would be the contact
but okay so um do you know how to Source
these
things yeah I have I work with the
manufacturer on how to Source them would
that be a conflict come from California
would you have to disclose that no not
really they don't care well it's a
familyowned companies and I work it's my
parents so oh there you go okay cool
yeah um we s them from a manufacturer so
the manufacturer that we work so it's a

[51:00]
the manufacturer that we work so it's a
weird system there's a de a dealer they
deal all kinds of different mail parts
that we buy from them for mail machines
they work with a distributor I would
probably have to disclose it to them but
that would be a conversation I'd
definitely be willing to have with them
I have a good relationship with them do
you think that you would have to pay
someone like Fenway Park to put it there
or it's just like listen this is a
better experience for your fans we are
going to charge them you don't have to
manage anything there's a credit card
reader on the machine just direct them
there from now we'll put one at every
gate um I think you do Revenue share I
think if you Revenue share it with them
even that'd be incentivizing I don't
know if you'd have to necessar pay us
wondering if if you yeah I'm just
wondering if you don't lead with that
right and of course negotiate to that
but it's just like listen this is going
to be a better experience for your fans
they're going to want to come back to
more games and these are really
expensive so just let us put them there
and I mean it's pretty shady to walk
over to a box truck and put your
thousand purse in it right that thing
could be gone with the time I was
thinking the same thing the nice part is
too with these we can do full we have a
company that does full full custom wraps

[52:00]
company that does full full custom wraps
so they can wrap it and make it look
like Boston Red Sox you know oh yeah
make it wrap it to where it looks like
it is official and not a box truck in a
parking lot yeah okay so I think you
just need to get like three or four
people on the phone and it's not hard to
find the the the decision maker here
like get on LinkedIn hop on the UK
website or Fenway Park try to find like
the facility manager or whoever and like
he might not be the guy but he's for
sure going to know know the guy and just
have a casual conversation with him like
you have the strength of already being
in the industry you're not just like
some college student that like would
like to try this cool idea one day like
you're already doing this right and so I
would just not even make it a sales call
and just be like what do you think man
like would this work would you need one
at every gate every other gate um and
just get his thoughts and that could be
a really really good business like you
said I mean I mean that could you could
make 50 grand every game right oh
absolutely I looked at up I
like a couple quick numbers if you got
if you captured like 1% of the NFL NBA

[53:03]
if you captured like 1% of the NFL NBA
cultural ball MLB Market it's like over
it's like $40
million if you just capture 1% of the
market of everybody that goes to a game
every
year yeah it's crazy there's also the
model pulling things
out yeah there's the model pulling
things out as well kind like the K
Rental well the kayak rental so there's
something in there that you get out of
the the P oh right so that's in my email
I said like at a campgr for example you
have a bunch of PODS there's things in
there there's you know a water hose if
you forget your hose hook up to the
water there's leveling blocks there's
even things that simple as chairs yard
games then there's no one working at the
camp real they walk up rent it out of
the thing and then they're getting
things out of the as well there's a way
yeah it's like hey if you don't return
this we're going to charge a card for
200 bucks period exactly exactly if you
don't return this water hose we're going
to charge you 100 bucks or whatever yeah
I mean I to put it back yeah I travel
the country in an RV and it's like how

[54:00]
the country in an RV and it's like how
many times did we forget X Y or Z or
firewood or whatever um I I definitely
like your first idea better because
there's no there's no inventory it's
just self- sustaining of course you know
having to refill with you know hoses and
firewood and all that would be a pain
still a good business model but I like
this more so if I were you I would just
I would try to get a dozen people on the
phone and just write down everything
they say and then you'll know if this is
viable or not um
yeah absolutely just go for
it well that's the point cool man well
thanks for calling I really like this
this is it's fun to to hypothesize about
this business because this is a good
business yeah it is and there's not
anything automated in the industry
already so I appreciate you taking the
time and having me on today and
responding to my email and stuff so I
appreciate you appreciate you put on the
podcast we gives me something to listen
to on absolutely appreciate you thank
you yep see you have a good one
Stephen

[55:00]
Stephen Chris how are you doing how are
you good how are you can't hear you good
I can hear you now yeah there's kind of
a lag but it usually goes away after
time got
it so let me pull up um what you
submitted
so Ste
what do you mean uh zapier X oh okay
like people leaving you had posted
something more expensive make right
right right converting yeah okay so tell
me about what you do and uh like what
type of customers you have so I've had a
web development company for about 10
years now and I'm trying to do this new
um I have some clients who I do a lot of
automation Consulting for and I'm trying
to scale you know to a larger than just
a web development company uh that

[56:00]
a web development company uh that
Services you know a small number of
clients and I realized I need a product
and so now I'm thinking okay everybody's
using zapier so instead of trying to get
people on zapier why don't I try to get
people off of zapier at a lower cost uh
and so I have my own automation
platform uh that is comparable to zapier
it's on my own system and setup and that
so I'm want to move people to my own
automation platform get them off zappier
I can guarantee that I cut their cost at
least in half and then we you know we
keep that client and uh we service their
automations and then we have a whole
engineering team that is experts at
automations so we can build automations
for them for very cheap like 40 bucks an
hour or even
less um so that's what I'm doing I'm
just looking for clients who use zap
here you know at a large is kind of
scale probably spend 500 to a thousand a
month on
zapier and so now I'm trying to figure
out how do I find these people you know

[57:02]
out how do I find these people you know
because my whole business for 10 years
has always been word of mouth and it's
worked you know and it's but it's I
realize it can't scale that way yeah so
now I'm trying to figure out I've done
you I'm just not quite sure exactly how
to find the right niche market for this
target
okay so can you speak to how many active
customers you have verse how many like
total people in your email database you
have uh active customers for uh for my
web development company I mean probably
30 30 and then I've got probably five
who are super consistent that are
basically the majority of my
business okay so 30 that are like paying
you
regularly yeah and in a in let's say
months probably 30 but you know probably
70% of my income comes from five sure

[58:03]
70% of my income comes from five sure
solid clients and of those 30 let's
let's just kind of separate them five
and 25 so like of the five what size
businesses do they have versus the 25 if
you exactly but ballpark yeah well
they're under all the five are under 100
employees except for one one is like a
giant corporate
but um yeah all five are under a 100
employees over than more than 10
employees and then the rest of the 30
are basically single one or two
employees are just by themselves you
know so and they're kind of a different
Market well yeah a lot of them are
politicians I do a lot of politicians um
and stuff like that
so um but yeah or solopreneurs or you
know very small shops how often do you
speak on the phone or on Zoom to to the
customers not very often I mean some of

[59:00]
customers not very often I mean some of
them I've never spoken on the phone to
some of them it's just all email okay
you know and I'm mostly doing their web
development not really any automation
stuff so it's kind of a little bit
different and what CMS do you use for
most of
them uh
WordPress okay only
WordPress I use webflow too uh if
someone wants to pay for it and you know
they want some Advanced nice looking
website but 99% is
WordPress or you know some custom
application like node.js or something
you know we build that out too but
that's a different kind of a different
kind of client okay and how many
automation clients do you
have so that's probably only about four
yeah probably about four where I'm doing
in addition to the 30 or are they're
part of the 30 no that's part of the
five the five main clients that's
basically what I'm doing for them is
running their whole automation operation
do you think that the 25 have a budget
for automation on a monthly basis um

[1:00:03]
for automation on a monthly basis um
they don't need it I don't think no I
mean they could possibly have the budget
if but uh you know I I don't see how
they really need it um I I just have a
hard time I just have a hard time
understanding why how anyone could not
use a in some way like let's talk about
a customer that you have specifically
that you don't think would need
automation okay let's like uh a judge
for example trying to get elected they
need a website I I I uh do a lot of
those you know political websites things
like
that um it just needs to sit there
collect donations and um the only thing
that they might need is social media
marketing automation um and this you
know I do lawyer to
uh you know I can see automation that

[1:01:02]
uh you know I can see automation that
they would need but it's a very you got
to get into that market so if you're
going to do lawyers you got to get into
the niche market of lawyers and build
automation that you can works with them
and works with other lawyers but you
know I do lawyers HVAC roofers it's all
over the place I'm just thinking like
with a judge that's collecting donations
he's more likely to com collect more
donations or recurring donations if he's
checking in with his donors right
regularly uh and he doesn't have time to
do that manually um I mean so you could
set up an outbound SMS or email
Automation and you can even use AI to
personalize it like hey man I just
checking in on your family like really
just once again wanted to thank you for
your support or just updates right like
things going well in the campaign here's
the progress we've made um like kind of
like marketing updates because I know in
my business I I raise money from
investors which isn't too dissimilar
from you
know accepting money from donors and the
more updates I give them on their
investment the more likely they are to
reinvest on future deals um like there's

[1:02:02]
reinvest on future deals um like there's
a it's a very it's difference between
like 40 and 60% reinvestment rate and
that takes automation um so I just like
I I think that if you really if you held
their hands and got them on the phone
specifically and said hey I was just
thinking man like I think you could
really you could really benefit from
this and here's why yada yadada y
statistic one statistic two statistic
three um and like this won't take any
more time for you but I mean it will
cost a little money there's a little bit
upfront and a little ongoing because
things always break y y y I bet you
anything like you would you you should
be able to convert a double- digit
percentage of your current customers to
be a recurring automation Customer
because you've done the hardest part and
you've sold them on why they should
trust you and why they should pay you
money um and it's a very tangential
service right you're not saying like hey
I want to come clean your gutters you
know it's like it's all Tech to them
like it's all things they can't
comprehend and it's all things that you
can do for them um I would think like I

[1:03:00]
can do for them um I would think like I
would take those 30 people and like put
them on a whiteboard and just start like
just send them an email like hey I just
want to check in on how everything's
going like we send them a cly L cly link
and just keep following up until you get
them on the phone but already have these
ideas for them when you get them on the
phone because they're not going to know
about this you have to plant the ideas
and tell them why it's beneficial um and
then just like maybe the con rate is
crap or maybe it's
60% um but I would exhaust that first
because that's the lowest hanging fruit
and then start thinking about like how
do I attack the legal industry how do I
do Google ads or paid ads or go outside
of Word of Mouth um right I mean you you
could double your business just by
converting yeah that'd be nice I mean
that's what I want to do so okay really
appreciate that it's good thought yeah
yeah I would give that a shot and let me
know how it goes all right thank you I
know you're on tight schedule here so
all right all right see you guys later
thanks steephen all right bye see

[1:04:04]
you Andrew that was perfect
timing hi can you hear me yeah can you
hear me yes that was perfect timing
thanks for
joining no
problem so you were looking for a career
change that's right I just finished 20
years in the Navy
and uh you know I went through the ranks
got as high as you could go in that time
and uh I don't really feel like working
for a large organization anymore so I
started my own financial advisor and tax
preparation um business which is a great
business in the long run but in the
short term when you come from a very
different field like the military it's
very hard to get started so I'm looking
for your perspective on you know things
to do to kind of like kick
start yeah so you're going to be
collecting retirement forever and you

[1:05:02]
collecting retirement forever and you
want to do something else cuz you know
we're not meant to sit around all
day
correct now what ideas do you already
have well I uh I've already formed the
company first of all and uh and so I've
got some practice with just like friends
and family um in terms of a niche I was
largely like
undefined uh of who I want to serve but
I think I finally know and I think my
target market is serving uh Gen X and
Millennials who are living in or
dreaming of living in Japan and
Singapore because actually I know I've
lived in Japan myself as part of the
military my wife's Japanese we got half
Japanese kids um and we understand you
know Japanese law and I'm also uh a
licensed tax preparer so I understand
about like foreign tax credits and
things like that that Americans need to
know because once you live overseas I

[1:06:01]
know because once you live overseas I
don't know if people realize United
States is one of like one or two
countries where you still have to file
every year it doesn't matter that you
left you still got to file your taxes so
um yeah just being a generalist based on
all the conversations I've had is is
probably going to get you nowhere but if
you can clearly Define a target market
by age and interest uh that tends to
like lead to where all your marketing
and social media content goes and uh I
was really struggling with that but it
kind of just came to me uh yesterday
that you know I'm similar to that age
group I've been through a lot of those
pain points where even thinking of
moving ourselves to
Japan um in the next year so uh I think
that might be a smart way to go now did
you say Gen X or gen Z Plus Millennials
uh Gen X and
I'm 45 so I was just in the bottom part
of the Gen

[1:07:00]
of the Gen
xers
yep um okay so you specifically want to
find genxers and Millennials that are
about to move or have recently moved to
Japan uh or Singapore and you want to
monetize by helping them with their
yearly tax prep or helping them with
that plus other things PLUS Financial
Planning because I'm also registered uh
with the state
which state uh Pennsylvania but you're
allowed to take clients from all over
and then as long as you follow the rules
of registration financial planning not
Financial advising well it is it is
financial advising but it's not just
Investments it's like the holistic
approach that you see on Twitter from
Thomas coppelman and other people yeah
it's just like Investments are in there
but they're pretty far down the list
compared to other things in the person's
life and is that monetizable by taking
like one % of their investable assets or
whatever that's one way to do it you
could also just do a flat subscription

[1:08:01]
could also just do a flat subscription
fee you know I'm already approved to
take uh 450 a month in financial
planning fees from
clients you can raise that the flat fee
lines uh yeah I think I'd prefer that uh
I if people want to have me manage their
Investments I'm also licensed to do that
and then I can take that What's called
the asset under management fee the AUM
as you were just describing instead in
lie of that um but I think most people
who are around my age and younger
probably feel comfortable just typing in
their own trades like they just really
need a coach for the overall experience
more so than to actually manage the
Investments okay and are you pretty set
on this idea I mean you filed your LLC
is is this where you're headed or you
open to other things I'm not saying that
because I don't like this idea I'm just
within certain parameters I'm pretty set

[1:09:00]
within certain parameters I'm pretty set
um because I've been already talk you
know I filed more than a year ago so in
my last year in the Navy I was doing
both I was like networking with other
CPAs and uh and financial advisors
trying to understand the business and uh
you know my thoughts have evolved a lot
since a year ago but I mean it's only in
the big picture it's only confirmed
strategically that I'm on the right path
because I'm always kind of a numbers guy
anyway uh since high school and these
sorts of businesses are a slow burn but
once they get going it can the clients
tend to stick with you for like 30 years
and never leave if you prove your
competence at least so uh so that
appeals to me I like helping people with
money I like serving people oneon-one
uh and and so that's where I'm at okay I
like it now have you um what are your
marketing ideas for getting to for
finding this unique yes category of
people I'm already on Twitter that's how

[1:10:02]
people I'm already on Twitter that's how
I found you but uh you
know barely post ever and I don't have a
lot of followers so uh that would be one
Avenue if I could just like buckle down
get serious about posting once every day
especially with this more specific
message to a specific audience think it
would probably get some better traction
we've already had a YouTube YouTube
channel too and it kind of suffered from
the thing same thing we weren't really
speaking to anyone specifically so we're
basically speaking to no one so yeah so
I like the videos we did but it just
they just never went anywhere so those
would be my two main ones uh I'm not
sure you could really do much paid
advertising at least in the beginning
and get any success it's it tends to be
Word of Mouth
referrals getting in front of people
I would I would think that you know
there's a decent amount of search volume
for very specific things like yeah you

[1:11:01]
for very specific things like yeah you
know moving to Japan or stuff like that
right like Google search volume yeah so
that could be one area just the paid
paid search option where certain
keywords get me elevated in the list and
that doesn't cost that much so I'd be
open to that yeah do you have any idea
about how many people are moving to
those two countries per year I don't but
I a feeling after the next election
there might be a big wave and but
there's already uh already I looked it
up this morning there's about 60,000
people living in Japan Americans and
there's about
30,000 Americans living in Singapore and
it tends to be you know you got a big
Hub of people mostly working for compan
American
companies um earning pretty high wages
living comfortable lives a lot of
Bankers a lot of investment bankers a
lot of people people at the like
Japanese car companies like Nissan would
also have American employees at their

[1:12:01]
also have American employees at their
headquarters um self-employment in Japan
is quite complicated there's I'm sure
that I've met a few of those people and
I would be one of them if I move but I
have a huge Advantage because my
daughter's already Japanese but just be
a regular run-of-the male American and
say I just want to move there yeah maybe
not but that's why I include Singapore
too because they actually have a program
where it's just income based if you can
show that you have a certain threshold
above like about $155,000 a month in
american-based income you can get a
three-year
Visa um so there may be that
population uh in more so in Singapore of
self-employed Americans compared to
Japan so I think it's enough of a base
and uh I like Singapore a lot I've been
there uh a few times but I really know
Japan like backwards and forwards so
what about I I'm sure there are a dozens

[1:13:00]
what about I I'm sure there are a dozens
of Facebook groups dedicated to this
have you thought of e at least posting
in there or approaching those or even
buying a Facebook group and just taking
it
over yeah um no I haven't I'm not a big
like meta guy but uh but I'm write
you're gonna start this I I think
there's a massive opportunity for people
to buy Facebook groups because most
Facebook groups are just a passion
project some random person started it
and it just grew on its own and it
actually has value um and 90% of them
are not monetized and even if they are
um like there's not really an open
market for it right we've bought
Facebook groups for2 to $700 that had
tens of thousands of people in it um
these were Bucky's Facebook groups so I
think you should find Facebook groups
for Japan or Japan Japanese xats us xats
and Singapore xats or even just like
Singapore Japan like fan page Facebook
groups seems to be american-based um and

[1:14:01]
groups seems to be american-based um and
you you really got to play the long game
on these um I've I've done it I've tried
it both ways um and if you just like
cold DM the administrator or the
moderator they're not going to be
receptive but if you join it and just
start contributing and you get like the
top contributor badge in there and you
kind of this could take like a couple
weeks it's not as hard as you might
think to get like a badge in those
groups and kind of make an for yourself
and then start reaching out and just say
like hey man like I love your group just
so you know like you're doing something
great it's very active Kudos that's it
and then a week later uh something else
and then a week later it's like Hey
listen you know have you ever thought
about X Y or Z and a lot of times you
can leave them in as a moderator um but
you have to be transferred ownership of
the group or they could still kick you
out after you buy it um so a lot of
times you can buy it and then pay them a
very menial amount to just kind of keep
moderating it or just keep them as a
moderator so they can feel good about
themselves um I would go that route

[1:15:02]
themselves um I would go that route
because this is so Niche um and then I
think the I think there will be targeted
Google ads that you could that you could
do for this as well um another thing
back to YouTube I have a friend that has
a really really good YouTube channel
it's called two and 20 those are number
two and 20 and they make um really high
quality long form YouTube videos about
like geopolitical events in other
countries so they're based in Canada um
but they make them about Australia the
US politics economics and they have like
eight videos but they've gotten hundreds
of thousands and millions of views and
they're faceless there's just them
talking it's kind of like a like a news
channel um and so like there is
precedent for someone making and it
takes them a long time to make these um
but like they didn't get any Boost from
Mr Beast they started at zero they

[1:16:00]
Mr Beast they started at zero they
didn't do any growth hacks or marketing
they just put out really high quality
long form YouTube content about these
other countries and economic events Etc
and um now they're monetized they're
making thousands of dollars just from
Google AdSense or YouTube AdSense and
you could totally do that just focus on
Japan and Singapore and just be like the
you know the age crisis in Japan
explained 20 minute long video or or you
know where did Singapore get all its
wealth from um stuff like that and it's
not going to be as targeted but it'll be
pretty dang
targeted yeah um you just it's just
YouTube's hard right it's a hard n to
crack but um I tell you the story as
precedent that like someone is doing
something very similar with a lot of
success without any paid ads or growth
hacks or special
knowledge yeah no that sounds great
man cool well I hope that's helpful um
and I want to know I want to know what
you do I want to know the

[1:17:00]
you do I want to know the
followup that'd be great I'll let you
know in about a year okay thanks Andrew
all right thank you yeah bye by
bye
Alec hey can you hear me I can how are
you doing what's up bro how are you
doing I am good what's going on my man
am I is my time on am my
you are early but it's actually perfect
because I'm like my schedule's all wonky
and you're perfect so okay cool yeah let
me let me dump this fish out real quick
I'm at work
okay if I take my 10 now yeah thanks
bro got
it no appreci appreciate that I wanted
to hop on early I didn't know I was like
maybe let me get on I don't know if he's
already started probably but um yeah

[1:18:01]
already started probably but um yeah
sure bro so make a long story short um
I've had this idea for a couple years
now um ironically I know you've been in
the crypto space as well this is kind of
when I got the idea to start this thing
what's up Scott how you doing bro um so
it's a phone case company and I already
have some of the uh for the mobile app I
already have some the code written out
um but I wanted to display an LED image
on the back with like nft verification
on there um so you can kind of see with
like multiple chains um allow you to
have like any picture you want to view
or your family even some gifs as well um
and the I wanted the phone case to have
two other functions as well either like
a QR code in the corner right next to
where your cameras are or an NFC
Communications chip so kind of like a
link tree or like a tappy card where
people are like oh what's that phone
case oh let me scan this OR let me tap
your phone oh you have all your socials

[1:19:02]
your phone oh you have all your socials
or whatever you want could be cash app
whatever and um and then to also have
like a little small little like clip at
the bottom of the case that allows you
to charge your phone as well um so kind
of didn't know um and I've had some like
I've worked with some Engineers like
third party contractors they kind of
somewhat built some prototypes and they
just didn't fall through they were going
in school and I had other founders with
the project that I did and um I would
say the project kind of died down but um
they kind of um you know everyone just
kind of went their own separate ways I'm
stepping out for my tent um so yeah um
and I've talked to a lot of people about
it they say this is kind of like an
e-commerce type of thing so um kind of
like where your mind goes and um how you
just like easily explain things so kind
of where do you see like if this was
your business or your idea how would you
approach it what would you yeah want to

[1:20:01]
approach it what would you yeah want to
do kind of like a double-ended question
let me let me understand if let me see
if I understand it correctly so it would
be a phone case that you develop
manufacturer cell that has um like an
integrated charger so you don't need to
take the case off to charge the phone
yes it has an NFC chip in it um and it
has like did you say like a screen on it
like it's only yeah like an LED screen
so like let's say if you had a board ape
or a family your picture or your
favorite GIF or meme that like that
constantly you know how some gifs just
like it's like a little two second video
or whatever picture Y where it's like
full color full display you could see it
on the back um have some like a little
small cooling function in there so the
case doesn't overheat keeps your phone
kind of cool at the same time so yeah
that's pretty much it what um did you
say it was a SAS business too yeah so um
kind of how it would work for you to
even display your image you're going to
have to download the app it's a free app

[1:21:00]
have to download the app it's a free app
obviously um and I'm sure there's ways
we could monetize that as well um so
you're going to download the app and
there's going to be like profiles um
kind of like a Facebook whatever but
it's not going to be like it the main
purpose is not for it to be a social
media thing it's like just to connect
with other users of the case people who
are into this stuff and um you'll be
able to change whatever image you want
and you could just go there and just
display your image okay um how long have
you had this idea you said you were kind
of working on it with Partners
half-heartedly but then that kind of
fell apart now exactly yeah um I would
say two years at least two years okay
and I just started doubling down I'm
sorry I started doubling down more this
year writing more code um and I use
language models to write a lot of my
code um okay so yeah that's so coding
the app for portion of it right yeah
have you ever done any hardware product
before like this no I I have
not

[1:22:00]
not
so I I think that this is a viable idea
I I think that people would buy this and
it would work I think it's interesting
and unique especially if you were to
integrate like a an extended battery
pack function to it because you you
might need that for the LED screen
anyway unless you just leech off the
phone um but there's a famous saying
that goes Hardware is hard right like
it's it's really really hard and it's
going to cost two to six times as much
as you think it might cost okay um I
think this is too ambitious of a project
I think that you you have the like I
mean we've talked for six minutes but
the fact that you're listening to this
podcast and you're calling in on your
lunch break and you have this drive like
I think you have what it takes to be
successful at hundreds of different
business ideas and I think this specific
idea is one of the few that you're most
likely to fail at because of the fact
that it's so ambitious and it's hardware
and it's software and it's e-commerce

[1:23:00]
and it's software and it's e-commerce
like all three of those things are hard
and you're putting them all together um
I want you to win and be successful and
I think this idea you're less likely to
do so um because it's going to take a
lot of money and a lot of time and then
a lot of like I think you'll have to
raise money um and then you've got to
make sure that you can get it developed
and then you got to make sure that you
could sell it it's a yearslong process
um um I'm not saying you can't do it I
don't know you very well right you could
be just an absolute killer um but I'm
speaking from my own experience and when
I bite off way more than I can chew I'm
more likely to get discouraged and just
shy away from entrepreneurship
altogether whereas if I bite off
something much more manageable um and
then like get a couple wins in start a
business start a bigger business sell
that get a couple wins in my belt a
little bit of money in the bank um I
think this idea is still going to be
around in three to five years um I and I
do think it would work but I think

[1:24:00]
do think it would work but I think
you're too early with it manager to the
a um what do you think about that I mean
I I kind of get what you're saying um
like I I think I've heard that quote
before and that makes a lot of sense
like you have to integrate all three of
those things and it's like it is kind of
like heinous when I am like kind of like
doing things I'm like okay well I need
to look up like Hardware things and I
need to see like the dimensions and how
much this will cost and like this is
obviously this is it I mean I haven't
seen anyone with this before so I have
to get like a whole new mold I have to
do samples I have to do different phones
um I have to it's like am I going to do
e-commerce I can also like start like
you can I'm only one person I can hustle
a lot I can go to like little uh U Break
iix like all the main like um phone
carriers or like phone repair places and
I'm like hey I got this product we can
you know if you you know I can give them
a cut of the sales I'm like well people
like this if you display it we have some

[1:25:01]
like this if you display it we have some
displays as soon as you come in so it is
a lot and um and like I said like
everyone was kind of halfheartedly
doing it and I'm just like the only one
who's like really just kind of just like
still kind of working on this thing kind
of
um yeah just It's just tough like it's
tough when you have an idea and you just
like
if you're not the type of person that
gets business ideas every five seconds
and that's that's who I am right like
yeah it's a blessing and a curse then a
lot of times people get one idea and
they just get fixated on it because like
they don't get a lot of business ideas
naturally and so when they do get one
that's good and I do think this is a
good idea they obsess over it and they
go all in on it but they're just
obsessing over it because that happens
to be like their idea it doesn't mean
that it's the best idea that they should
start um and I'm glad you said that
about different sizes of phones and
phones you know new phones coming out
every year because you know I had a I've
had a cell phone business for a decade

[1:26:01]
had a cell phone business for a decade
2010 to
2019 uh and it's brutal like there's a
you know there's a lot of people making
cases out there and you're going to be
at the very high end of that market but
you won't have a well-known brand to
support a price like that right right so
I feel like you're you're picking like
of the hundred hardest things out there
you you've got like six of them in this
one idea you know yeah and I just like
I want I want you to win and I I know I
kind of think what you were saying with
like you've already done a bunch of
research like that's if you heard of the
sunk cost fallacy what's that it's like
it's this fallacy that people have where
like let's say you go into the casino
and you play Blackjack and you lose a
thousand dollar and you're like d I'm
gonna I'm G I'm gonna win it back I'm
gonna win it back I'm In Too Deep I'm
I'm gonna get it back like that's a
fallacy you're like I've already spent
this money so let me just win it back
it's really no different than what an
entrepreneur says if they're like
already way down the line on an idea and
they're like if I quit this and I wasted

[1:27:01]
they're like if I quit this and I wasted
all that time so I'm gonna keep going
well that's called the sunk cost fallacy
and it's a fallacy for a reason um
because you don't know how much time
this will take into the future or how
much money right so right let's say that
like I know you're a couple years into
this but let's say you've worked
fulltime on it as in 40 hour weeks for a
year straight you're like I can't quit
because that's all waste of time first
of all that's not wasted at all that's
like an MBA that's like a very cheap MBA
that you've given yourself so don't
count that as wasted second of all this
could take six more years to to bring to
Market or to make a profit so in that
sense if you could Flash Forward a
decade and look back if you had that
luxury you'd be like man if I would have
quit at year one that would have been
really smart uh because I still had I I
I hadn't even tasted difficulty yet
right right um so hope I'm not
discouraging you but I don't want to
discourage you from entrepreneurship I
just want to give you a dose of reality
on this idea and how hard it will be

[1:28:01]
on this idea and how hard it will be
from someone who's been in that exact
industry you know yeah no and I would
appreci I didn't I wasn't expecting
anything I just like I knew you were
just going to give me a different
perspective and that does like that
makes a lot of sense because I'm like
mid 20s now um I live in Southern
California live with my wife so it's
like do I just keep spending time and
money onto this thing and I'm like oh do
I start the case with just the screen
first and then build that and then keep
going and I'm like and it's like I don't
want to like marry this idea because
who's to say OtterBox or case toy or one
of these other guys see it and we like
they already have the resources they're
like well we'll just put this together
and and we'll just sell it and we'll
just put you out of the market and I'm
like uh it's like yeah
so yeah it's like a lot of times the
best ideas are right in front of us and
we're like looking over them to get to
the idea that we already have yeah um
I'm trying to think of an example when
I've done this but you know how to code

[1:29:00]
I've done this but you know how to code
right like that is a sought after rare
skill that enables you to build millions
of different products or apps or pieces
of software or websites that you could
sell for zero doll cost only your time
right so it's like you're using that
valuable skill that you might take for
granted to build this Hardware when it's
like what if I forget the whole hardware
part and just keep working on the
software to build something else right
yeah that makes sense so yeah if I were
you I would get have you ever heard of
Indie hackers I've not I maybe what can
you want it sounds like really familiar
Indie hackers I think it's Indie
hackers.com yeah Indie hackers.com is
just like it's a community of people
like you that are mostly coders
entrepreneurial and just building stuff
and it's it's kind of like a forum
Message Board a Blog all of the above I
would just go start consuming all the
content you can on Indie hackers and
that is going to give you so many ideas

[1:30:00]
that is going to give you so many ideas
like you're G to read about a guy who
built the Chrome extension that helps
you scrape uh Yelp for Faux restaurants
in Sacramento and you're like dude I
could do that wait he grew a 10 grand
mrr in three months what if I did that
for ice cream shops in in San Francisco
like it's going to give you all these
ideas and then start actively posting in
there and building a community and a
name for yourself and then you could
find like a a mark Mar co-founder or
another technical co-founder and like it
just gets you in the game and helps you
start building a community of of people
um that are doing what you're doing and
thinking like you're thinking and you're
going to get a ton of ideas from them
and then you're going to give ideas to
them in the process as well yeah and
like especially my area like I live in
Newport Beach California so it's like
this is one of the wealthiest places on
the west coast so I'm like dude I'm like
all these people around here and I'm
like like these people are just
millionaires just by like net worth in
their homes like equity in their house
like it's not even what they have in the
bank or their assets so I'm like how do

[1:31:01]
bank or their assets so I'm like how do
I like just get to them and just like
connect and network and just like build
something for myself like because I'm
not I don't need to be like a
millionaire if it's just like I got a
couple Grand like higher than what I'm
making now then like life would be
amazing like I could buy a house I could
like just start a family like and that's
just like pretty much the goal so I
didn't want to get like stuck to my
business or just like married to an idea
where I'm just like stressing out cuz
I'm like a I'm a man of Faith so I care
about my family still I don't want to
like you know do all these things and
that's why I appreciate like what you
have to say too like you just you have a
know a lot of knowledge in business so
and I know you're a man of faith and and
you've knocked on a lot of doors I've
watched a lot of your content and um so
yeah no that that that makes sense I I
have to start doing more stuff like that
and just getting getting my foot out
there my name out there and just
connecting with people yeah going to
send you a video here in the chat of
this guy in somewhere in California it's
not new Newport Beach it was like

[1:32:00]
not new Newport Beach it was like
Beverly Hills or something and he he's
he has a startup and he literally just
went door too at these mansions and
asked the person there will you invest
my startup and it was brilliant and he
filmed the whole thing and now he's like
going viral on Instagram and so now
people on Instagram are like hey that
guy at the door didn't but I will that's
a cool idea um if you live in a wealthy
area like that you could totally copy
that um and do what he's doing
okay let me see
but yeah just put it in the chat but
you're going to win man I mean you're
asking the right questions you're doing
the right things um I would just keep an
open mind about what you actually
launch okay no I appreciate that because
it kind of does open my mind because I
did did you mention it I didn't now that
you did like I kind of just you showed
me I was kind of close-minded I'm like
well I'm married this is going to work
like I'm going to because I have a
detailing car detailing business
business on the side too I'm like this
is going to work I'm going to be doing
this this this and this is this and this
is how I win this is my ticket and that

[1:33:00]
is how I win this is my ticket and that
kind of like does make sense and um
because I do talk to some entrepreneurs
out here and they it's never the same
story like they they done a bunch of
things yeah and like you have one in
some few cases where it's like okay they
did this they hit the the lottery not
the lottery but they hit it and then
they just went with it but it's all
different so um yeah okay yeah uh
survivorship biases you know listening
to stories of people that made it and
thinking like like the movie uh Pursuit
of Happiness with Will Smith you seen
that yeah yeah great movie right he he
slangs these these Healthcare machines
barely makes it he dude how feel bro I
know dude this is sick I'm like people
would love this this is gonna be a great
product it's a great movie but like they
don't make movies about all the will
Smiths out there 100 to one that fail
they don't make movies about them yeah
you know so that's survivorship bias
that's like all right I could do that
but like that he is the outlier right

[1:34:01]
but like that he is the outlier right
that's the outlier so card de detailing
is another thing you could be looking
right over right like just looking right
through something that could be a huge
opportunity that you're already doing um
don't let pride get in the way either
right like there's no idea that's it's
too small especially if you're trying to
provide for your family so okay all
right man heck yeah bro no problem good
luck have a going man thank you you too
you too
bye hey
man hey hey how's it going can you hear
me yeah how are
you can you hear me okay perfect I think
there's a little bit of delay yeah there
is but it usually goes away over time so
if I cut you off it's just because of
that delay I'm not trying to be
rude no worries no worries uh um yeah I
mean super nice to meet you officially I
know we've chatted a little bit on
Twitter um and so it's been super nice

[1:35:01]
Twitter um and so it's been super nice
kind of following you and you know I've
now um also write a little bit of
content on Twitter so my main question
today is kind of based around my local
newsletter um that I'm trying to build
here in Winnipeg um before that I'll
give a little bit of like quick context
just so you have some background okay um
I'm 23 right now I graduated with like
architecture degree decided not to
follow it um currently I my main thing
is I am kind of the operations guy for a
offshore hiring company um where I'm
trying to grow that that's kind of my
main thing but have started this
newsletter on the side um not sure if
you know who Ryan Seldon is he's also on
Twitter but he oh yeah he's been on my
show yeah so he's uh he also grew a
local local newsletter as well
naptown yeah exactly so kind of
following his footsteps I started this

[1:36:01]
following his footsteps I started this
thing in like a Canadian city it's
called Winnipeg um not sure if you know
where that is but it's right above it's
right above Minnesota here um so started
that and you know I started that
probably about three-ish months ago and
um you know what got like a few
subscribers like 150 from
just got down the format and you know
how how it was doing um and then started
running paid ads to it I would say May
22nd um as that's the main source of
acquisition for most of these
newsletters how so started running
subscri um yeah so currently I'm
spending about a125 Canadian um that's
good that's really good yeah which is
which is well below kind of what most
Acquisitions happen at but
um the reason for that is there's kind
of a unique opportunity in Winnipeg I
would say where it's a big city in terms

[1:37:03]
would say where it's a big city in terms
of population so it has like a
population of 800,000 people 900,000
people or something like that um so it's
a big city
but but the thing is that it's not a
tech forward City so it's not like
Calgary or Vancouver or something where
people know about like how how to run
newsletters and marketing and everything
um it's still I would say a fairly like
run on Old like old Tech and a sense
right like there's not that many people
that know about things that are going on
um so it's pretty easily like if I were
to let's say even just replicate things
from Twitter onto what's happening on in
Winnipeg like it's there's a lot of
Arbitrage opportunities I guess you can
say um y so I started this newsletter
because I saw that there were similar
newsletters in like Calgary Ottawa and
other Canadian cities but there wasn't
one in Winnipeg um so I've grown that to
about in a month of running ads to now

[1:38:00]
about in a month of running ads to now
having 3500
subscribers um and then also so I send
it out three times a week right now and
um in terms of Instagram followers we
started uh Instagram account on
June 1st and what's the name of the of
the newsletter it's called Winnipeg
digest okay yeah anyway sorry Instagram
page grew to what it's to at 8K now so
8K in a month oh wow in a month wow yeah
so well I have a little bit of
background growing Instagram pages and
stuff like that too so that's kind of
plain to my play to my advantage I would
say but we're right now posting like a
real a day um just talking about events
and stuff that are going on around the
city um yeah also I've grown that to 8K
and now the not the struggle I would say
but the thing that I would like help
with is how do I go about monetizing
this thing should I even monetize this
in the beginning um in terms of what I'm

[1:39:01]
in the beginning um in terms of what I'm
doing for it right now um I have had
like I would say four or five
sponsors okay um I've talked to other
local news that people and they've said
hey building an Instagram audience gives
you like local Authority so then you can
you know talk to businesses and they'll
take you a lot more seriously um first
is that second is like you want to s
this as like a package deal rather than
like selling it as cpms because most
local businesses don't know what a CPM
is um so that's General feedback that
I've gotten for now I have had a few
sponsors right now going about the way
of like hey first three sponsors get
like 80% off next three sponsor 60% off
then 40 until we're at full
pricing yeah that's that's generally
the okay so you you'd rather know how to
get more sponsors or how to grow faster
or both I think growing faster generally
is kind of like for at least from what I

[1:40:00]
is kind of like for at least from what I
understand is like Facebook ads for now
is like going to be the main bread and
butter with the second thing being like
referrals so I've started now
incorporating um kind of like not lead
magnets I guess you can say lead magnets
where okay you refer two people you'll
get like the top 150 restaurants in
Winnipeg or something like that so I
started doing that and that started
generating like a referral system slowly
um and you know more I'm getting very
good engagement I'm getting folks saying
this is amazing you know there wasn't a
place like this it's kind of the first
time that we're able to see what's
actually happening before the event is H
going to happen and so on and so forth
so that's been like super good
engagement and everything now the main
struggle is like how do I go about
monetizing this yeah and can I monetize
this at such a small scale or do I have
to hit like 10K subs or something in a
800,000 City to then be able to monetize
it what have you charged your three

[1:41:01]
it what have you charged your three
sponsor so
far um so I've been going at a CPM of
like $100 so right now my my my open
rate is about 53 is%
54% um so I've gone like see click rate
is if I focus on it in an email then
like I can take it to about 12% if I
don't focus on it um then I can keep it
at like 4% as well yeah like it's really
dependent on how much do I want to keep
the reader on my email versus how if I
want to drive up the rate and then in
terms of Engagement we also have a poll
at the end of each kind of email just to
see how if they liked it didn't like it
um and usually the engagement on that is
like let's say, 1500 people open the
email around 50 to 55 people will like
answer that poll at the end that's
pretty good
yeah yeah because I I mean I use beehive
you're using beehive I have a poll I
have an open rate like um that's a good

[1:42:00]
have an open rate like um that's a good
that's a really good poll rate I don't
know what they call it poll percentage
um so I just got kind of a unique idea
that could be brilliant could be stupid
um have you thought about approaching so
first of all I love the Lo local news
better newsletter business idea I've
thought about doing it myself I almost
did it a couple years ago um have you
reverse engineered uh the capital daily
Andrew Wilkinson's and Victoria yeah um
in terms of in terms of what I've
reverse engineered like a few news ERS
in terms of like format and what they do
um and even like in terms of Instagram
content I follow like you know Boston
New York pages and so on and like we'll
do my spin on those those versions of
content um in terms of longer Vision as
well the goal here for me is like I
don't know if I'm going to do ads for
the next two years or three years or
whatever it is but then eventually I
would like to spin off other businesses
from this as I will have like a local

[1:43:01]
from this as I will have like a local
build audience um you know seeing
potentially what ads do the best for me
and then going off based off of that um
I can just spin those businesses up
myself or partner with them yeah okay
first of all I would I would go back to
Capital daily uh because they're
literally doing exactly what you're
doing and it's the same country um I
would go look at like their first 20
newsletters not just any 20 but their
first and you already have the format
down so don't worry about that I would
look at like when they added their first
sponsor and what that sponsor was was it
a bakery was it a SAS business and I
would just like take notes of all that
and say like okay whatever Andrew
Wilkinson's doing I'm gonna copy um
because he's a pretty smart guy so I
would could just kind of look to that as
inspiration another thing I would do
that kind of just came to me um is you
can knock out two birds with one stone
if you approach local businesses in
Winnipeg and say hey uh you've got what
I need I've got what you need what do I

[1:44:01]
I need I've got what you need what do I
have I have an audience of 3,400 people
plus 8,000 on Instagram and that's only
over 28 days who knows where we'll be in
the next you know 28 months um I want to
advertise
your auto repair shop uh I want to write
about it my newsletter and these guys
are uh I I know my demographic is high
income they're white collar yeah y y y
like they're highly engaged they're
involved in their Community it is the
type of audience that you want and that
you need um so I want to talk about your
auto repair shop in my newsletter what
do you have you have an email list of
23,000 people of your customers uh what
if we do this what if I like I advertise
my newsletter to your email list or you
share your email list with me share in
quotations as in give it to me um and
then I give you a highly discounted
sponsorship or free or like think about
what like if if they had an email list
of 20,000 that's worth $20,000 to you
that's 10 times more than what you would
get from them as a sponsor so you could

[1:45:01]
get from them as a sponsor so you could
give them a free sponsorship placement
they don't care like they don't care
about these emails they probably hardly
ever use the email list and you can send
them one email up front and just like
you could do it one of two ways you can
do it one way which I don't recommend
where you just like work them into
beehive and now beehive has import
limits you'll have to get around but
work them into beehive and just start
emailing them as if nothing happened I
don't recommend that because you're
you're unsubscribed and your bounce rate
is going to go way high first of all no
matter what you do run them through an
email Checker because a lot of those
emails are probably old and dormant and
you want them to be I would run them
through three email Checkers I use bulk
email Checker there's hundreds out there
run them through like three or four of
them and only accept the cleanest
greenest ones that have like no DNS
issues or they're not like catch all
emails um and I would either give them a
free sponsorship
or a discounted sponsorship and just say
I want to just add them to my email list
um so just for sorry I didn't get to the

[1:46:01]
um so just for sorry I didn't get to the
second option what I recommend doing is
emailing all of them once and say Hey
you know this is who we are yada yada
yada um I partnered with owner of auto
repair shop uh I'm just going to start
sending you the local news um if you
don't want it go ahead and unsubscribe
right here and then work into your
flow so just for reference here actually
so what we started doing is another
version of that so there's a shop called
for example the locals they put on like
a huge like 300 people local vendor
event type of thing um and they have a
email list of like 10,000 people we're
doing something similar with them but
the way we're doing it with these folks
is like they're just going to send out
an email after the event saying hey if
you're looking for local news you know
like go subscribe to this or something
like that um for in return obviously
like us giving them a free sponsorship
and making like a real for them or
something um I'm also doing that with
like another kind of like concert host

[1:47:02]
like another kind of like concert host
person who has a bunch of these like
past people emails right so people that
have bought tickets in the past or
whatever and he's basically saying that
he has about 16,000 people as well and
he reached out to me saying hey um you
know I would love to kind of work
together in some way now I don't know
how much I don't I don't know if I want
to Target that Dem graphic or not right
um because it's because right now the
email is more focused on like
familyfriendly events and so on and so
forth in compar to like his email list
is more like people that like to go to
Raves and all that stuff so um but yeah
so we have been kind of trying to dabble
in dabble in that world and I think
we're we're trying to go more more that
route yeah I would just like not even
like I would look at any literally any
business in Winnipeg as a potential
referral partner with their email list
because everyone has an email list most
people don't utilize it like they should
and if they could trade something that

[1:48:00]
and if they could trade something that
they forgot about for something worth
actual dollars that could bring them
more business it's a no-brainer killer
offer for them and so it's like you
you're kind of a a Marketplace issue
you've got you need to sell ads but you
need to grow subscribers I would focus
more on growing subscribers because
that's going to make selling ads even
easier um and I I like the idea of of
you know sharing emails with other local
businesses noted yeah I think I think
we'll definitely start going more in
that route and then what would you say
is like a good number in like I don't
know if it's a specific number if it's
like a feeling that we'll have but
what's like a good number to like okay
now we're established enough to like
okay we don't need to do discounts and
all that but we can um we have a big
enough email list that we can actually
start now focusing on
sponsors so what would be number because

[1:49:01]
sponsors so what would be number because
what I'm scared of
is even right now with like 3,500 folks
right what I'm scared of is me not being
able to deliver a return on investment
for that Advertiser right um first is
that and second is like I would
obviously like to build a longer term
relationship with these folks and trying
to like I don't want to chase the short
dollars if I can't deliver on the
results just yet right and with such a
small email list of like let's say 3,500
people right now my pitch has been the
same or like hey we have this many
people um you know let's say a dentist
you have such a big um you have such a
big like value that you know even if we
bring one client to you that you by just
spending let's say $200 with us and we
can even get one client that's a huge
return on investment for you right so
that's generally been what my patche
been yeah so one last thought and then

[1:50:00]
been yeah so one last thought and then
I'm I'm like almost out of time um that
I'm glad you said that because that led
me to thinking this like that's one
reason why I think you should reverse
engineer the capital daily because
you're going to see what types of
customers that they accepted as sponsors
um and then you're going to see over
time like maybe you see for the first
three months they only did restaurants
and then two years later they're only
doing dental offices and that's probably
because they learned that dental offices
have a high Roi because you made a great
point and they like you've got to sell
this to people where it actually works
if people don't click and if they don't
buy then it's not going to work and
you're GNA have beat your head against
the wall so I think you should find the
type of customers that the capital daily
is finding and I think you should
experiment and find the right balance
between um either a customer that just
wants brand exposure that doesn't care
about tracking and they exist right like
a Coca-Cola billboard how do you know
know if that works you want to find
customers like that and then you want to
find customers that have the right mix
of high ticket and high volume uh and so

[1:51:01]
of high ticket and high volume uh and so
like a $100,000 sports car that's that's
probably way too high ticket it's like
if you only sell one then it pays for
well you're probably not going to even
sell one whereas a dental office might
be a great mix where they could sell two
and it only cost them $200 and that
brings them $88,000 in Revenue um so
you've just got to find that right mix
because if you're trying to sell appers
for a restaurant then they might sell
$100 worth of appetizers for a $300 ad
placement and it's too cheap right makes
sense makes sense good I I would
experiment with yeah I would experiment
I would take like a list make a list of
10 different types of industries that
fit that mold and just try all 10 of
them honestly and just test it and just
keep the data
yep thank you thank you all right thanks
man good luck bye thank you see you
you're trying to sell all right Rome you
are the last caller thank you for
joining thank you for having me um yeah

[1:52:02]
joining thank you for having me um yeah
I was just live waiting for yeah can you
hear me okay yeah I've got yeah I've got
nine minutes I'm meeting a friend for
lunch so I'm almost out of time all
right I'll do a quick introduction so
that you have some background and then
I'll talk about my idea um I'm Romel I'm
a Sofer engineer I work in financial
services graduated two years ago got my
CFA done but now I'm thinking of more of
trying to start my own business with my
friend um I started watching your
content about a few months ago and I
learned a lot about you know just
thinking about business case studies
really marketing marketing uh master
classes really about how you think about
marketing it was amazing to Y that um
and now we have settled on this idea uh
to with my friend who is who works in
insurance and I am a software engineer
and we trying to start a business as
co-founders as it which is the idea is
basically an underwriting AI co-pilot
for insurers so basically it allows them
to do two things in the commercial and

[1:53:00]
to do two things in the commercial and
Specialty Insurance it allows them to
write more insurance with the same
amount of Workforce because AI does a
lot of work for you and the second thing
allows them to do is better due
diligence using your manuals and
guidelines better and being able to do
you upload all that beforehand uh
exactly so the basically when the broker
sends you all the information you feed
it in and the AI does the work to
present it present the information in a
good way to you to help with some of the
due diligence also look up online use
your manual um and all these things take
all the information and put it to you in
a presentable way and it really speeds
up the operation of doing the due
diligence and being able to find things
that you wouldn't even have thought
about questions you wouldn't even have
thought about using AI so that's the
idea we're trying to go for now we are
basically to broke people who work
full-time and be trying to um that's
good you have a PhD you're poor uh
hungry and driven yeah yeah um yes so um

[1:54:03]
hungry and driven yeah yeah um yes so um
I am working on building the MVP as a
software engineer he's helping me with
the um the technical specifications in
networking and thinking about how we go
about our plan investors and our current
plan is that we want to build the MVP
for this particular Niche because um
there's a lot of competitors out there
but there's a lot of fragment to in the
industry because AI is so new that there
isn't like a perfect solution that
everyone uses that is standard across
the industry as an underwriting
workbench as we call it or an
underwriting AI co-pilot um and they are
all mammoths with like 15 million $30
million in funding SAS companies and U
and like literally MIT phds as CEOs MIT
rocket scientist so we competing with
the biggest mams you can possibly
imagine so I really like your idea about
how you think about niches right you try
to St solve for a niche expand from
there and then I can go around finding
more customers and my question for you

[1:55:00]
more customers and my question for you
is how do I try to build more
Connections in the insurance industry me
as an outsider first of all and my
friend is an Insider but and we based in
Toronto but he has a difficult time
networking and telling people about the
idea because he's working full-time in
his company and he doesn't want his
company to know that um he's working on
this idea so what we want to do is
really find some person with a really
big problem for examp example they're
really struggling with construction
insurance or directors in operations
insurance and we want to solve this
Niche specifically for them and Market
it to them that we are the best at this
so that we can expand from there and I
really want to learn more about sales
and marketing from you getting in the
right places making the right
connections and expanding to find the
right person with the MVP and for the
MVP and build the product around them
and then have them love it then expand
to more users and then think about
getting investors as we have traction
okay so are you is is your partner able
to find customers or does he he just
kind of speak the language of the
industry he speaks language he's

[1:56:00]
industry he speaks language he's
basically we we we started off like also
talking to people in the US a lot
because us people wouldn't know him and
they wouldn't like um there's a chance
that someone in Canada knows him and he
talks to his boss being like oh this
person is up to this so he's really
scared about losing his job like that um
but we talking to people in the US
basically C Outreach through Linkedin
and um that's their methods right now
this GOP through Linkedin to
Underwriters and finding potential users
and are you a did you say you're a
student right now I Was A student two
years ago I'm working fulltime since the
past two
years um who's is your customer a a a
company that is having insurance issues
or is your customer an insurance agent
it's an insurance company or an MGA a
managing General agent and basically
companies that write
insurance um to write insurance to
businesses okay so it can be an AIG or
any kind of middle or small insurance
company that just Insurance could one of

[1:57:02]
company that just Insurance could one of
your customers just be like Joe Smith in
you know Plano Texas that owns a State
Farm Agency could that be a
customer
um not sure but basically it's like a
it's like a SAS right someone who sells
you know Insurance products to
homeowners or car owners is that
customer of yours um it's not Brokers
it's insurance company so if it's an
insurance company or an MGA then yes
um yeah so like you have to sell this
into a corporate setting or into a small
business setting um basically a small or
medium a med small medium size insurer
or an
MGA do you know of any of not a
competing product but another SAS or
another app that sells to the same
customer maybe something different
completely but the same customer does
anything come to
mind um yeah so basically are you

[1:58:02]
mind um yeah so basically are you
talking about like other software
products out there that these insurers
use is that what you're asking yeah um
yeah so there's like tons of big
products that these insurers use like
guidewire to do their policy management
or um there's basically a few different
SAS providers that help with basically
the entire Insurance workflow within the
industry
um so if I were you I would find the
guidewires there's probably you know a
couple dozen of them these types of
software that they might be selling a
CRM right but it doesn't matter like
they just need to be selling something
to the same type of customer the same
job title as what you're selling to and
see if you can find as much info as you
can find on the founder like the
original founder a podcast that he was
on a Blog that he wrote a social media
post anything where he talks about how
he started his business how he got
that's what actually we're doing right
now because like I said there's
fragmentation in the industry right so

[1:59:00]
fragmentation in the industry right so
we using the leverage of my friend
working in the insurance company and
being like Oh I need to buy this
underwriting co-pilot from you and we
literally getting that competitors on
demos and basically we have had a few
demos with our direct competitors about
who are doing the exact same thing to
understand what they're doing their
Journey the product but on those demos
are you learning how they found their
first customers or you just learning
more about the product
um they are usually people who are so
well established in the industry with
tons of connections who are 10 20 years
in and have like millions in funding so
I guess like it it's I I didn't think
deeply about it being um a hard
challenge for them to find that first
customer but yeah I should think about
that too I I would like I would find out
before they had funding but when this
was just an idea how did they find their
first customer and then their first 10
customers what methods did they use um
was it maybe their dat owned a big
insurance company and they kind of had a
cheat code maybe they just did cold
outage on LinkedIn maybe they texted
people maybe they cold called people
maybe they went door to door um I I

[2:00:02]
maybe they went door to door um I I
would find that like it's out there you
could find that even if you just got
someone on the phone and were
transparent with them and said listen
I'm not competing with you like I'm
young I'm hungry I'm driven I just want
to know like what would you do to get
your first customers well we did
actually we went to this one trade show
we went to 10 trade shows but this one
brought us 80% of our customers oh I
need to get to that trade show you know
um I think that will be your best bet
like outside of learning Google ads like
it's so Niche it's so specialized you're
selling to something very specific so
just copy what worked for someone
selling a similar or selling anything
into the same type of customer okay okay
and I guess like how do you go about
networking and coal Outreach after that
like in general to connect with more
people in Industry as me being become an
Insider in the industry how do you about
that um well I I wish I could tell you
but I'm completely out of time but what
you can do no you're good you're good go
to go to Google type in Twitter advance

[2:01:02]
to go to Google type in Twitter advance
search uh that's the only way you can
find it go to a window will open open up
in Twitter do an advanced search for my
username for the phrase cold email and I
wrote like a thousand word multiple
threads on exactly how to do that cold
email at scale that works very very
effectively and read that
okay all right man well I wish you the
best of luck and I want to hear how it
goes thank you so much thank you for
your time no problem see you bye bye
