[00:00]
there are 200,000 average monthly
searches for Botox alone only in the US
and the competition is low so top of
page bid is five bucks but it's still
low competition 22% year-over-year
change so completely sold on this more
generally speaking I'm completely sold
on lead generation sites with
programmatic SEO and basically automated
AI generated content plus paid Google
ads like kind of like a three-tier Str
so we're trying
[Music]
this all right welcome to the ker office
I'm still fired up from this episode I
just had with Connor gross he's a guy I
met on Twitter that's a lot like me he's
10 years younger than me he lives in New
York but he has an e-commerce business
he buys Self Storage he Wholesales Self
Storage he made 360 Grand profit on a
wholesale deal he's just always ideating
launching things hacking like he's all
like me and so I want to start
interviewing people like that where we
can just Riff on ideas and we had no

[01:01]
can just Riff on ideas and we had no
shortage of ideas programmatic SEO lead
generation sites Botox High rocks
selling energy bars you name it for like
50 minutes we just jammed on ideas
Non-Stop and it was really fun so let me
know if you like it and I want to have
Connor on every month or so enjoy we've
got Connor gross here Connor is a friend
that I met on Twitter and he's a lot
like me except younger you're in your
20s right Connor yeah I just turned 27
last month so 10 years apart I'm 30 7 so
Connor lives in New York and he buys
self storage and he starts businesses
and he's in e-commerce and we're doing a
lot of the same stuff and he's
definitely an idea guy so I just wanted
Connor to come on and just talk business
ideas and just Riff on some cool stuff
yeah man I mean it's funny hearing you
say the idea guy part too because I was
on a call yesterday with a friend who
actually lives in Dallas Fort Worth so
remind me to connect it with him if I
haven't yet and we were talking he's two
years younger than I am and he was like
oh yeah I want to launch this business
because I'm doing these things he has

[02:00]
because I'm doing these things he has
two companies right now both of them pay
him a ton of money and he makes good
money on it but he's like I'm not going
to spoil the idea that he wants to go
after only because it's you know he's
very into it but he's like I want to do
this and I want to do this for the next
50 years and this is gonna be my big
thing and he's like I I have so many
ideas I hate the fact that I'm getting
like you know shiny object syndrome and
and he was like what about you like
what's your favorite business that you
run right now I was like well if I'm
being honest like it's probably going to
be the next one because things things
always seem better when you haven't
started them yet and it's like that
classic I don't know if you've seen the
graph before but it's like you know you
have this idea you're like why hasn't
anyone thought about this yet and then
you start getting into it you're like oh
there's actually a ton of competition
for this and then you start launching it
you're like this is really hard and then
you get a win or two and you're like
okay it's actually not as bad as I
thought like coming from the idea Guy
background it's like your favorite idea
is always the next one because you don't
know all the headaches and frustration
and struggles that are going to you know
be a part of that journey I know and
it's kind of like we're hardwired to
forget like forgetting is a a feature

[03:00]
forget like forgetting is a a feature
not a bug like when I run ultramarathons
every single time throughout the whole
thing I'm like this is stupid I'm an
idiot you're dumb why are you doing this
no one cares that you're out here this
literally doesn't matter you're in
extreme pain this takes 36 hours never
do this again and then I cross the
finish line and I feel good and then
it's like okay that was awesome I'm glad
I finished but never doing again and
then like two days later to like as if I
could set an alarm to it I start looking
up the next race it's like what and same
with businesses like all right this is
really hard this is really hard like
let's stick to what you know like don't
go out of your comfort zone and then I
just either I'm an idiot or I just
forget and I do it all over no it's I
think it's human nature to forget like
right now I'm I'm living in New York I'm
in Jersey at the time of this recording
but my girlfriend took the bar the New
York law bar last year I remember her
being extremely stressed out the enti
stressed out the entire time and she was
we're talking about it this past weekend
because everyone's getting ready to take
the bar again and she was like oh it
wasn't that bad I was like you forget

[04:01]
wasn't that bad I was like you forget
it's very it's very common nature to
only remember the good things from a
situation so yes yes so you you texted
me about this idea what is
tus oh you don't know tus I don't know
tus is that is that like an indie band
tus blew up tus is well okay let me let
me just Google their things that I can
read out the exact name of it but it's
effectively like intelligence research
insights so if you ever heard of these
companies where they they'll effectively
say you have a $100 million fund and you
want to figure out you know you want to
get involved in let's just use self-
storage because it's relevant you want
to get involved in the self- storage
sector great you know nothing about self
storage tus is going to connect you with
everyone who owns or with professionals
and people in the industry who own own
or like are involved with Self Storage
so realators Brokers owners sellers
wholesalers whatever like if you are in
the space and you know what you're
talking about they are going to connect

[05:00]
talking about they are going to connect
you with them now there are plenty of
these like Consulting style platforms
the really interesting and arguably
genius part of what tus is doing is
they're not marking up the conversation
so if I turn around and say you know
something I'm done to have conversations
all day long about self storage put some
time on my calendar to youus you know
build me out a 250 an hour the normal
company is going to say all right we're
g to charge $500 an hour to meet with
Connor and we are going to take the
difference CH is that like
catalant uh I think catalant does that
yep catalant does that who Alpha sites
does that there are a couple other ones
that do it and they you know they Mark
you up as for your service but they're
also you know bringing the client in so
they provide a value what tus does is
pretty interesting is so you play pay a
platform fee kind of forget what the
platform fee is I'm on their website
right now but like any good company they
have a pricing page and don't put the
pricing on the on the website so they
will say all right I think it's like or
10 grand a year let's call it you pay

[06:01]
10 grand a year let's call it you pay
that you get unlimited access to the
people you want to talk to and with no
markup so it's like the Costco esque
model but more than that what you're
also paying for is you get access to a
database or a library of all of the
other conversations that have ever been
had on the platform oh wow and so
because they transcribe them and so what
they tell you is like all right if you
if you book a time with Connor and you
talked about self storage and you talk
about how you want to you know take
advantage of a deal down in southeast
Florida whatever they'll they'll remove
like the incriminating slash you know
highly personal details of the
conversation but they will include the
key insights and they'll give you a two
I think it's a two to three week head
start to act on that information and
then afterwards the transcribing or the
recording of the data is then put into
their database as well I think that this
is a super interesting type of business
because it gets you all of this really
unique data without you having to build
it at all like it's crowdsource data

[07:01]
it at all like it's crowdsource data
effectively I think building some kind
of research company that can then turn
into a data product I have another
example after I finish this rant I think
it' be really really profitable so who's
paying the platform fees is people like
taking the calls or making the calls the
people that are making the calls so if
you
are if I'm a big hedge fund and I want
to learn about self storage I pay 5 to
10 grand a year and then the Self
Storage expert doesn't pay anything he
gets paid an hourly rate yep the self
Source expert gets paid an hourly rate
right so there the tus is reaching out
to these experts and they are saying
join the platform it costs you nothing
you can only make more money so it's a
no-brainer
pitch okay it's also pretty cool like
you know from just to give you an idea
in terms of like their customer base
they have 3,000 customers and they're so
like I don't I don't know you and I come
from the e-commerce World 3,000
customers is cool it's not anything
crazy but they have three 3,000

[08:00]
crazy but they have three 3,000
customers but they're valued at four
billion um they do a lot in revenue and
they have grown like a weed in the last
five to six years so I think that one is
really cool and so let me give you
another breakdown in terms of this
business model applied in a different
industry that can be a little bit more
because I think yeah something that's
like more like we could wrap our heads
around yeah so I've Got a Friend College
buddy one of my old roommates he is in
the food sector so crazy background but
like he graduated college and moved out
to Montana lived on a bison Ranch and
started basically creating their bison
jerky line and like marketing it towards
Independent Grocers and chain stores and
all of that he quickly realized damn if
you want to navigate either any of these
small stores like you know Joe's health
food store on the corner of 123 Main
Street or if you want to get into
Kroger's Nationwide it's really hard
because the little guys don't have their
contact information online because they
don't need it and the big guys don't
have their contact information online
because it's a hell of an orc chart and

[09:01]
because it's a hell of an orc chart and
it's difficult to navigate so he has
since left that jerky business and he's
working with someone else right now and
what they do is they sell a service to
small independent Brands so if you have
your Chris's coffee and he says okay I'm
GNA get you into every you know I'm
Gonna Be Your Business Development arm
you're great at making coffee I'm great
at sales we are going to call around all
of these stores try to get you into all
of the shops that you need our markup is
charge a small flat fee SL a reoccurring
fee plus X percentage of whatever the PO
is that we get you at that company right
so that alone is a good model it's it's
a you can back into the profit on that
model it's reoccurring Revenue you eat
what you kill so you know you're only
getting part of The Upside and it's
niche so like it appeals well he's kind
of like a broker right like he builds up
all these relationships maybe it's with
Joe the owner of one grocery store maybe
it's the regional buyer for Albertson's
and he's like hey I've got some bison
jerky for you hey I've got some organic

[10:00]
jerky for you hey I've got some organic
coffee for you and just take cut of the
purchase order and so he's he's a broker
in that sense and you know he builds up
the business development arms for these
different companies but the other really
interesting thing that he does is he's
he's basically like turning the light
switch on in the room and he's like all
right here's the contact information for
the small guys here's the org chart of
who's the buyer in this category with
their email and their phone number in
this category and he takes all of this
information and he basically sells his
CRM so he sells his CRM as a data
product where he says you're a small
independent company you want to get into
retail you don't want to pay me that's
fine you don't have to pay me buy my
data product instead and I think that's
really cool because the data is
essentially the sawdust let's call it of
all of the work that he's doing for this
service brand which is already
profitable and now the cost of good sold
or like a product essentially that he's
selling is a z fulfillment cost because
he already has it built out so he's
doing both he's doing both he's doing
like the the the higher ticket but

[11:01]
like the the the higher ticket but
harder part of just calling these guys
on behalf of the food brands and then
he's just is the data that he's selling
just a monthly subscription or a
one-time fee or what yep monthly
subscription you get access to it it's
it's updated on a daily basis you get
new buyer information you get their
email their contact information where
they're at like it's a cool it's a cool
concept that is cool because I mean he's
probably going to end up making more
than these food brands are he will
definitely I mean unless unless he's
working for the RX bar right you know
eventually the food brand
this bis Devon house but he will
definitely be making more than the food
brands I think yeah I mean I like we
used to own a company called send eats
where we we did all the logistics for
these Niche these Niche food brands and
they don't make any money most of them
go out of business it's a really brutal
tough business so I'd rather be on the
data side of it I agree there I went to
school up in Boston I went to noreaster
there were two guys one while I was in
school one after I graduated that I got
in contact with and the poster child of
Entrepreneurship and North Eastern
during the time that I was there was

[12:01]
during the time that I was there was
this company called eat your coffee they
sold essentially call it RX bars with
caffeine infused in them cool concept it
was really neich and like this is also
coming during the time when like right
now I feel like if I'm on Twitter if I'm
reading entrepreneurship stuff people
people are leaning more towards the
business the boring stuff the things
that are proven ideas this was during
the time when like people wanted that
Uber people wanted to hear you run a
company not that just that it's a
painting company but it's a sexy brand
and
the guys that were running this company
they you know they launched it they
formulated a way to get caffeine into a
a bar they scaled up they got some you
know some fundraising they got into
retail but I think at the end of the day
they had you know an okay exit like not
to down talk them good friends of mine
but like sure you know they they had a
fine exit it wasn't like like they are
retiring on a beach somewhere after that
you know I'm now I'm two or three four
years postgrad at this point I had a
conversation with this other kid who
who's at North Eastern and he's like I

[13:00]
who's at North Eastern and he's like I
am launching seaweed chocolate bar and I
was like and he's like oh there's all
the benefits of the seaweed and I was
like I was like dude you seem smart like
you seem like a hustler like I can tell
just B based on the fact that we're on
this phone right now like you like to
come up with ideas you like launching
stuff you're like an entrepreneurial
person like you will be successful in
something that you do I'd never want to
be the the bearer of bad news when it
comes to it like prove me wrong if this
is the case but I would say you can
probably make more money doing something
that is more improved now yeah so you
know unless you're unless you're like
the RX bar founder who I know I don't
know if you if you've seen recently but
have you seen the new product he's
launching what's it called I think it's
called David I think it's called David's
bar um I don't know if I heard that is
it is [ __ ] in Florence like the Greek
sculpted God yeah it's gonna be cool I
don't know how he does it but it's
like yeah it's 150 calorie protein bar
with 28 grams of protein all right if
you are watching this clip right now you
are watching this on YouTube and if you

[14:00]
are watching this on YouTube and if you
are a fan of podcast please check out my
podcast while you're at it because
sometimes I have podcasts that aren't on
YouTube and sometimes I have YouTube
that aren't on podcast so check out the
Kerner office on any podcast platform or
you can go to TKO pod.com also my
newsletter will throw that in there
there are no ads It's weekly it's
different content than my podcast and
YouTube newsletter. chrisj cerner.com
You'll see the link and we'll see you
there holy cow I'm looking at it right
now I has like a a gold rapper David I
don't think I don't think he's launching
yet but you if you're like hey you're
the RX guy RX guy was like the Pinnacle
of all of this stuff a few years ago and
now you're building this Ultra macro bar
you're going to be pretty successful
well the problem with these food brands
is you don't make any money until
hopefully one day you get a big exit
like RX bar because if you're growing
then you have no cash you're constantly
raising cash and spending it on new
inventory so is the the inventory game
yeah that's the problem I mean eCommerce
game I know I know I I will say on that
though do you want to talk about the
other thing I texted you because this is
a food company I won't say who told me

[15:01]
a food company I won't say who told me
it because I I don't like outing people
in public and I don't think these
numbers are private do you know element
I would assume right element what just
lmnt and maybe electrolytes no I don't
know if I do oh you don't know these
guys okay look them look them up and
then just for the sake of this call all
right so I've seen this I've seen this
before but I don't consume this you
don't any reason why or just just
haven't gotten around to it I don't see
it around like it looks familiar The
Branding looks familiar but yeah I don't
see it around okay so I know I know
we're kind of put you on the spot here
right now but these are electrolyte
packets they've got salt in them they
have pottassium magnesium like their
whole thesis is the FDA or whoever's in
charge of the narrative around nutrition
in the US was always saying salt is bad
sodium is bad yeah half L salt half less
sodium they're like okay if you are
sedentary in your lifestyle and you have
like diabetes sure if you're an athlete
if you're mildly fit if you sweat during

[16:01]
if you're mildly fit if you sweat during
the day if you like have cognitive
functions that require a lot of your
focus dur the day the average American
is actually not getting enough salt for
their for their dayto day and so they
create these really easy supplement
packets where you can drop in a drink I
buy them all the time they taste great
they're solid and genuinely notice that
like if you not even if you're hung over
but like if coffee is just not doing it
for you because maybe you've dranken
your third cup of coffee and you're
super dehydrated at this point these
actually making me feel better both
physically and mentally because it's
like oh yeah I'm like replenishing
something my body seeing what you see
now how much do you think they do in
sales and profit I know that's a loaded
question first of all like before I even
get there like I totally agree with you
like I did keto a while back and like
all of the issues that people have with
keto is because lack of salt right and
like if you can get enough salt
magnesium potassium in you're fine and
when I was running ultramarathons like
it all came down to to to Electro
and I I genuinely believe that not

[17:01]
and I I genuinely believe that not
enough people are drinking electrolytes
on a daily basis so I'm sold on the
thesis like jez I don't know nine
figures Top Line eight figures bottom
line 130 million in sales and with like
let's say 22%
margins okay you're extremely close 200
million Top Line 40 million bottom line
dang okay wow for for a salt packet
that's pretty crazy it's crazy because I
I want launch something like this I
wrote a newsletter about it did you read
that it's called busy juice oh yeah yeah
yeah yes I did I did yeah it's just cuz
like I I had the same problem I want to
drink a gallon of water a day but
water's boring right and so I started
getting those moo packets just to make
it more flavored and then it's like okay
this is like 100% red dye number 40 and
I'm drinking a gallon of it like I don't
know what I'm doing but this can't and
it's not like I felt bad I felt I just
thought this can't be good for me right
yeah and so I just started yeah I just

[18:01]
yeah and so I just started yeah I just
started ordering crap on Amazon and kind
of experimenting tinkering and came up
with this lemonade and it tastes like
Chick-fil-A lemonade but it's just lemon
Stevia and caffeine and I drink again so
like I know exactly what's in it and
it's caffeinated and it keeps me
energized all day long and it keeps me
hydrated and I can even put light salt
so light salt is like part potassium
part sodium and then you just got to
throw some magnesium in there and you've
got all your electrolytes so I've been
drinking this myself and like I plan to
sell it one day but it's one of those
things where it's like you've got a
consumer package good and it's
e-commerce like food it's like all the
hard things so I'm not I'm not excited
about starting it but I also want to but
I will say so you know don't sell the
liquid right like I think I was gonna do
only do powder I bet you could probably
do that so I know I've read own the day
Own Your Life by Marcus Aubrey Is It
Anyway like a lot of cool things from
that book it's like know it all but it's
like a good read because it's just talks

[19:01]
like a good read because it's just talks
about hey here's how to think about
having a successful day as it relates to
relationships working out you know
eating like all of this type of stuff
but always talks about and was something
I did for like a year afterwards and now
more on the element game but you wake up
in the morning you're already dehydrated
rather than just like don't drink coffee
right away like you know this is all the
andrewman stuff too now but drink a
glass of water and squeeze like a wedge
of lemon in it and a little bit of salt
drink that chill for like 20 minutes and
then get your coffee and I started doing
that I was like wow this is like maybe
Placebo sure noticeably different for
me and I feel like for your busy juice
thing too I could also see like you know
maybe something that elements not doing
this they got the mag magnesium
potassium whatever but like even very
small particles of dehydrated lemon
dehydrated orange could potentially be
cool as well so I mean I don't want to
just make this an ad for like an
intellectual thing I think the reason I

[20:01]
intellectual thing I think the reason I
texted it to you from a business
standpoint is this is also an idea that
I've had for a while there is this
entire category that I've talked about
for two to three years that I really
like but unfortunately it's a hard to
execute upon category and the category
is essentially like minimalism in a
sense so I really like the idea of
detoxing you know using your phone less
I really like the idea of meditation I
like the idea of fasting things that are
essentially removing the stimulus and
you know extra things that are
constantly sold to us on a daily basis
the tough part about that category is
like by Nature it's hard to create
products and services in that category
because you want to do less and I think
that with element knowing how big it is
and I think people are starting to begin
to
see that they are either you know doing
a lot of sales or everywhere I think
that doing very Niche versions of that
would be extremely beneficial so Niche
versions from one of two ways you know
one is the what does it help with okay

[21:01]
one is the what does it help with okay
collagen element can you know for for
nails and and skin and all that that's
starting to get over done a little bit
but the one that I wanted to do was just
called like Fast right or something like
that and it's literally element designed
for people who do intermittent fasting
like it doesn't break their fast exactly
so it's it's you wake up in the morning
you put this in the water exactly what I
just described here from the beginning
of the day side and it's got supplement
style margins right you sell you sell
the thing for you know 80 90% gross
margins on it and you just put it in
your water in the morning and you get
after it and you drink your black coffee
and you have this doesn't break the fast
make sure you have your electrolytes no
flavoring you can add flavoring if you
want whatever but like I think that is a
cool concept or you could genuinely just
take it and like slap a sport thing on
it and so have it be element for soccer
element for football element for track
whatever what about like even element
for like Ultra endurance events and you
could you could distribute that by just
sending free packets to all the races to

[22:01]
sending free packets to all the races to
just put in like the race packets yep I
Marathon a couple years ago and like
there was noon everywhere the noon
things the idea is not new it's like
there's a bunch of these coming out but
everyone wants to be the Nikes everyone
wants to be the something to everyone
category like even okay I don't know if
you did this like would you always eat
before you would go on runs not usually
I usually ran fasted same so I feel like
a sick name would be run fast yeah and
it's like little salt packets before and
it's like you know catch double anra is
that the word where it's like okay
you're running in a fast in state make
sure you at least have the electrolytes
that you need prior to going dude one of
the stupidest good ideas that I had
about a month ago on this podcast is
electrolytes for dogs cuz I went on a
run and I came home and my dog just
started licking me which he doesn't
normally do and I'm thinking you just
need electrolytes like you are leeching
my salt then I thought huh if I were
like a dog lover I would think oh you
poor thing you know like I need I'm not

[23:00]
poor thing you know like I need I'm not
I love my dog but I'm not like a dog
person so thought you could totally just
get literally get some co-packer that
has salt magnesium and potassium to put
it in a container and just say put this
label on it for dogs dog and just
sprinkle it on their food I was going to
say everyone's targeting the dog food
bowl right like you look at Farmer's dog
it's a100 million doll plus business
everyone's targeting the the dog food
ball no one's talking about the dog
water balll and it's just water like
literally I same exact story I went I'm
down the shore in Jersey right now I
went swimming in the ocean yesterday I
came back and my parents dog was just
like licking my ankle I was like oh yeah
you probably want the salt but like you
know the most fun thing that happens to
a dog's water bowl is people get is you
put ice in it right like like there's
got to be something better than that for
for the dog and especially people who
want the supplements or whatever I think
even honestly I wonder if it would
change the taste or if they would
noticed but like people who give dogs
their supplements that's a big cat
category no if anyone is doing dog

[24:01]
category no if anyone is doing dog
supplement powders where you just mix it
into the water bowl that seems pretty
interesting to me I don't know you know
dogs don't drink all their water one
sitting so maybe like it it
recrystallizes or you have to mix it
occasionally that might be annoying I
don't know if it's viable but I could
see that being kind of cool you know
what else you could do that isn't like
it isn't as easily shippable as a powder
but you have you have you ever been deer
hunting or anything that love yeah so
when you go deer hunting you can buy
like these salt block
and you'll put it out there by by the
stand and the deer will come and just
lick it because they need salt I wonder
if you could get those like get the same
manufacturer to just like break them
down into much smaller pieces and just
put that like next to the the bowl or
like the food bowl or the water bowl
because that is one concern is like your
customers might overs salt the dog and
like kill him yeah and it could be a big
liability but if it was like if the dog
could control the level of salt that he
was taking in it could be a different
experience altogether oh 100% I I'll
will also say just that was reminded me

[25:01]
will also say just that was reminded me
of a small story that you would
appreciate being an ultra Runner so I
have a friend his name is Ryan we grew
up in the same town together and the guy
is just a Savage he runs
ultramarathons several times a year like
he's done like the Moab 240 and like
like insane it's insane well what the
craziest part about it too isn't the
Moab 240 like I always joke about this
it's like 242 miles and they're like
we're just going to round down like
you're at the point where it's so many
miles that like you just round down but
anyway the the guy is not built like a
runner he's 510 190 pound stocky guy but
he's but he's just mentally different
and he was telling me the story where he
had one dnf and for listeners right now
who don't know what dnf is dnf is did
not finish so he's had one dnf in his
entire career and the dnf came because
he was training here in New Jersey all
summer for this race I forget I think it
was Bigfoot something one of the Bigfoot

[26:00]
was Bigfoot something one of the Bigfoot
races that's one of the other 200 MERS
it's in Washington like Mount Olympus
okay 200 yeah yeah so he was training
for that and when he's out here training
I guess you know this as well like you
take salt packets because you sweat so
much and it's it's not like you're
running a marathon where it's like okay
I can get through it like there are
points where like if you don't have the
salt or electrolytes like you're
shutting down and so he's taking salt
packets out here because it was
summertime and he's sweating like crazy
and he goes to run the race and he made
two mistakes the first mistake he made
was he bought salt packets but he like
just bought them out of a CVS or
whatever and didn't look at them and
they were three times the strength of
what he had been taking out here yeah
and and then secondly the climate was
dramatically different I think if you
said Washington I thought it was
Colorado for some reason but like it
like somewhere was just drier and less
humid and so he was sweating less
naturally and so he was taken three
times more salt and sweating you know
call it 30% less and he hit a point
where he's like mile 95 he's like my
feet are so swollen that I physically

[27:02]
feet are so swollen that I physically
cannot move anymore and like I think he
broke some bones and and stuff like that
so yeah a not not to derail from the
from the dog supplement one but it's a
crazy story no I've done that because
it's really hard to regulate or even
know how much salt you need like I I'd
run ultramarathons and I'd roll up to an
aid station and they'd have salt pills
and I'm just like seven sure you know
and then like yep I go to change my
shoes and my feet look like elephant
feet they're in
and then and then I'll start peeing like
every 10 minutes on the trail like an
insane amount and it's just getting all
those fluids out because you've been
retaining it so I could totally see that
happening they're they're a crazy
business it's also C well sorry actually
very unimpressive businesses it seems
like from from Ryan who I talked to he
says how you know he'll go to a race and
there a ton of volunteers and there are
like 35 people in the starting line I
was like is the is the race making any
money like no these people these people
just love their stuff I know like I I

[28:02]
just love their stuff I know like I I
wonder the same thing they're always
begging for volunteers but then they
have you know 3,000 entrance paying 200
bucks a piece and I'm like how are you
not making money on this what are your
thoughts on H rocks okay what is hrock
you don't know H Rock dude I don't I
don't know hrock well so okay so look it
up so so H Roos is I think it'll start
taking off it is CrossFit but different
okay it's like a tough mutter but for
CrossFit yes
per yeah well well said so so it's how
do I explain anyone who listens to this
right now that actually does H rock is
going to critique the hell out of my
description so I'll read heard summary
yes I'll read the summary right now with
over 40 plus global races in 2023 seeing
over 990,000 athletes and 50,000
Spectators welcome to the world series
of Fitness racing hrock is a fitness
competition that combines an 8 kilometer
of running in eight functional workout
stations it is an indoor hybrid Fitness
racing event that alternates running
with functional exercises it builds

[29:00]
with functional exercises it builds
itself as the world series of Fitness
raising and a sport for everybody so so
is it like the the CrossFit Games with
more running I think it's the CrossFit
games but more accessible and I think
here's the cool thing if so I I do a
combination and you know I think my my
knee's pretty banged up right now so so
less so right now but I do a combination
of running Jiu-Jitsu and lifting
probably going to not do as much of jitu
in the future because I'm getting way
too hurt but I think people like running
in part from the you know the health
benefits and setting PRS whatever but
it's specifically I think that PR
element where when you're running you
can say damn I shaved up some time on my
splits here or I set a new PR for how
far I was able to go and there's like
this cool trophy case straa badge you
know feeling to it lifting you don't get
that as much unless you're sing PRS and
to be honest like if you're trying to PR
all the time like you you'll probably
get hurt or things just like you you
look good you can lift heavy but you
don't feel that good all the time

[30:01]
don't feel that good all the time
because you're just like damn things are
tight things I just tweak my back
whatever so I think that hro is pretty
interesting because it gives people back
that competitive nature that they want
and that people love as a sport but in a
more functional way that has maybe
hopefully a lower injury rate and it's
growing like crazy like if you look at
even as Google Trends on high rocks or
you look at all of the gyms that are
popping up that are specific gyms for
high rocks athletes you'll see that it's
consistently been picking up for the
last three to five years and I think
that there's a big opportunity to build
everything that has already been built
for the CrossFit space for the you know
every other sport in the world space
specifically for H rocks and have a lot
of success H so high rocks for different
sports basically no I think I think
different businesses for high rocks okay
okay so so let's let's break it down
like TRX for example TRX is a really T
Rox and Rogue are two really big
CrossFit Brands and I'm sure that both

[31:01]
CrossFit Brands and I'm sure that both
of them can be applied to H rock as well
but like one thing that H Rock does as
an example is they're really big on
assault bikes and ski irk machines I
know that again I've never done this so
if people have more information
apologies but they're really big on
those two machines because it's like
kind of functional and it's a little bit
more cardio based and pushing yourself
like can you develop things that make
you better at those machines can you
develop a supplement brand as we were
talking about before that is the
supplement of H rocks you know can you
build a content and news site that is
specifically for H rocks will you build
like I have a buddy who is building a
gym right now over in Denver where the
average membership for that gym said the
average amount of people spend every
single year at that gym is $20,000 and
they're marketing themselves as the
premier highrock gym and they do like
blood work testing and they do recovery
and and you know recovery I'm sure is a
big one here so I think that there are a
lot of opportunities to see how you can
make money from this growing sport piggy

[32:00]
make money from this growing sport piggy
piggyback on high rocks in other ways
1,000% I like that I can't believe I've
never heard of it I mean like I've never
been involved in CrossFit or any of that
like I just like to run and ride my bike
all by myself for many miles at a time
that's all I do yeah well I I mean this
this I don't know if you have a
competitive nature I don't know if
you're running ultas more for yourself I
think it's worth a shot like I also just
like it from the standpoint of you know
I've done cross I think frostfit is cool
I lately I don't know like I'm about to
sound older than I am on this podcast
but like dude [ __ ] just starts hurting
and I'm like I just tore my Meniscus
last month I reh herniated a disc three
months ago and I'm at this point where
I'm like like I like having Hobbies but
I also like walking and so I need to
start picking my hobbies a little bit
more carefully yeah I think I'm built
like I'm built like a Cadillac I'm I'm
like thick and like I don't get injured
ever knock on wood but I know that if I
run and I cycle like I'm just I'm not

[33:00]
run and I cycle like I'm just I'm not
fast but I'm just like sturdy I'm just
like a V8 I'm not going to win any races
but I'm just I'm just sturdy so it's
good that's a good one maybe update your
Twitter bio built like a Cadillac I want
to hear about your lead genen business
idea because I'm doing something in this
right now and it is I I'm like so
excited about it and I just want to copy
and paste it in all the all the
industries all right so this is I was
hesitant to share this one because like
I genuinely want to start this one but I
in the in the spirit of not gatekeeping
business ideas and all I'll preface with
this is if you hear this idea and you're
like that's a good idea I'm gonna do
that just like DM me and like let me be
a part of it like I'm put a money for it
in some way or like I don't know
anything I want I think it's such a good
idea and well 100% work so here's the
concept my girlfriend can't burp and
there is a large community of
individuals who cannot burp Wilson right
he just came yeah he just came out and

[34:01]
he just came yeah he just came out and
did this long Twitter thread that was
all about how he couldn't burp but he
fixed it and his life has changed so how
did he fix it I don't remember but it's
there I bet I bet it's what I'm about to
describe then so if you're in the
subreddit subreddit called RN burp there
are 30,000 people in it close to 30,000
people and the lately the more I go
around drinking and this came up two
weeks ago and I'm like drinking at a bar
in New York I'll bring up Sarah usually
drinks wine because the carbonation
really upsets her or she'll drink you
know Twisted Teas or some kind of like
no carbonated beverage because the
carbonation after two or three you're
like damn I feel like I have to burp but
I can't and it's like really bloating
and uncomfortable so here's something
that everyone is stared to find out who
experiences this there is a way to solve
this you get BOTOX in your neck very
little like not that's that's what
Andrew Wilkinson did I pulled up the
Tweet as you were talking so we got botx
in his neck he didn't say neck but he
said Botox I believe it's in your neck

[35:01]
said Botox I believe it's in your neck
this is not medical advice I don't want
to pretend to come off as a doctor I'm
not I think that's the solution based on
what I've read and based on what I've
researched for my girlfriends but it's
like you have this feeling your entire
life of like the equivalent of like
chugging a beer and a Seltzer and then
having to hold it in afterwards like
like nobody wants that and it is a
growing thing there's somewhat of a
hereditary thing like I know her mom
camp we met some people over the 4th of
July and we brought up they're like I
haven't been able to too I thought it
was just me like I thought I was this
crazy person but like my mom can't
either and so I think it's I think it's
a little bit hereditary and I think it's
a bigger thing that most people realize
and when when I say Botox like I don't
know maybe I have somewhat of a stigma
of this but like it's not like get rid
of your wrinkles it's like you look
physically no different afterwards but I
got again I don't want to pretend like
I'm giving medical advice here I think
it has something to do with your length
nodes or something that allows you to
contract them and effectively get air
out of your stomach I think I think that
it would be such a killer and easy idea

[36:01]
it would be such a killer and easy idea
to start a Content website called burp
again or whatever you want and make so
much content about the subject that I
don't like I it would not be hard to
rank to the top of Google for why can't
I burp how to burp again you know like
bloating after carbonated beverage
things like that and then creating lead
gen for local areas where you can refer
patients out to Botox doctors which I
think you know they do a handful of
things plastic surgery and all that
other types of stuff and so like you're
selling a very high ticket thing like
you'll probably get paid very handsomely
for these leads and I think it would
crush I don't think it would be a $10
million year business I think that if
you do it right and put it on autopilot
you can probably get this thing up to
doing a couple hundred, dollar per year
in mostly profited again this is
something that like if I had no
companies today I would do this tomorrow
but unfortunately it's just like not
worth a time so if somebody's listening

[37:01]
worth a time so if somebody's listening
to this and they're like damn I like
that concept shoot me a Twitter DM Conor
gross and I'll pay for the money to set
it up you have to do all the work and
I'll kind of coach you through it a
little bit but I love the idea so much I
love this idea so I did a little
research while you were talking first of
all burp again.com is open so you could
buy that before before this podcast goes
live second of all I pulled up the
Google Keyword Planner I looked up Botox
can't burp I can't burp the competition
on all of them is low there are 200,000
average monthly searches for Botox alone
only in the US and the competition is
low so top of page bid is five bucks but
it's still low competition 22%
year-over-year change so completely sold
on this more generally speaking I'm
completely sold on lead generation sites
with programmatic SEO and basically
automated AI generated content plus pay
Google ads like kind of like a three
tier strategy so we're trying this I'll

[38:01]
tier strategy so we're trying this I'll
tell you off the podcast what the
industry is but we are trying this in an
industry right now and I've done a ton
of research on Google keywords and
there's over well over a hundred maybe
300 different industries that could well
that could go just as well if not better
than the industry we chose and we're
we're we haven't even launched but we're
just putting out AI generated content
that that fits certain longtail keywords
and then we have three different
services that we offer in 1,000
different US cities so we've
programmatically generated 3,000 landing
pages and we're upping that to 5,000
here soon that's crazy service in city
state service in city state with with
like a lead capture form on everyone and
we've only indexed like 236 of these
5,000 pages so far and every single day
it's like more and more and more we're
ranking in the top top 10 for terms
we're getting clicks we're getting leads

[39:00]
we're getting clicks we're getting leads
all of this you getting leads yes like
actual leads purely organic no before I
did any of this I tested it with paid
Google ads and I was like okay I like
what I this is really good let's invest
some money into SEO and it's really
working and so we're actually thinking
seriously about launching like a
programmatic SEO agency to where we
could do this for others right it's like
give me the industry we'll just kind of
deliver it tie a bow on it deliver you a
package you run the whole business we'll
give you some pointers but you're going
to pay us three to five six seven Grand
to just get everything set up for you I
love it I think I think the thing that
is helpful here is I think you have to
create a lot of content around this
business model because I think you know
affiliate marketers and people who are
like deeper in the trenches on the
internet know about this all day it's
not something that is widely talked
about right now they do at least in the
communities that you and I run and so I
think proving that this can be an
effective business model is super
important one thing that I missed the
mark on and and sorry let me ask you

[40:00]
mark on and and sorry let me ask you
before I say what I missed the mark on I
think the biggest thing for this whether
it is a service or a product because I
think people do a lot of the affiliate
product stuff right now it has to be
high tiet it makes no sense unless it's
high ticket and I remember it was over
or highly recurring I mean really it's
the same thing right sure yeah yeah High
LTV let's call it that lifetime value
and I think one thing that I missed the
mark on over Co is I was like ah I just
sold my company I want to get into some
kind of affiliate site and I like I
spent a day or two looking up content
keywords and I think both my biggest
strength and biggest weakness is I have
a stupid bias to action where like it's
great in most data dayss when starting
new things it tends to be a hindrance
because I'm like I don't want to spend
the time researching and figuring out if
this is the right thing let me just get
buy the domain start the website hire a
writer build out a keyword plan and just
go after it and I did this it's in the
Dentistry space so I started I think it
was I don't think I own the domain
anymore I think it was called like

[41:00]
anymore I think it was called like
Superior smile or something like that
and I was like doing Le genen or
affiliate sales
for water picks for retainers for like
all that type of stuff very very low
ticket items it wasn't worth the time
wasn't worth the energy I shut it down
like months later so total waste of time
but where I think I missed the Mark is I
used to own a tiny house blog and the
tiny house blog never made that much
money I think it made uh
thousand or $2,000 doll in profit every
single month but like nothing nothing
crazy but like you know we rock we
ranked for I bet if I even look it up
now we ranked for like best appliances
for tiny house best dishwasher for tiny
house best furnace for tiny house and
what I should have done a better job at
is you know we had all this traffic we
were doing original content to like I
literally hired a writer to scrap
Facebook groups and like do like
essentially like I don't know what
they're called like profile pieces on
different people who own tiny houses we
should have done way more lead genen for
somebody who wants a tiny house built

[42:01]
somebody who wants a tiny house built
you're selling a 20 $30,000 thing if not
arguably more and like people would pay
several hundred dollars for that and I
should have done that it just was like
it was the lowest priority on my to-do
hence why I never got around to it we're
buying tiny houses right now for RV
parks and you almost can't find them for
under 70 grand they go up to way off in
the prices yeah exactly so you know I
mean there's always a trade-off though
there's a trade-off between the volume
and and the ticket price right so 100%
you got to find that happy
medium yeah what I like about the
service one like I think services are
better services are for sure better
because especially with like in also as
I said my idea earlier like big
disclaimer big asterisk on all of this I
don't know if that's legal I don't know
if you can legally sell uh leads in the
medical space I think you have I think
there are laws around legally selling
leads to a legal space like to attorneys
and stuff there is for legal I don't
know about Healthcare I have no idea

[43:00]
know about Healthcare I have no idea
either it feels like if there it is for
legal maybe it should be for healthcare
but that's a whole other thing but point
point being I like the the business
model a lot I think you you nailed it
with a high ticket and we are doing that
in ours like I was looking up kitchen
remodeling no one's bidding on kitchen
remodeling that's like A3 $40,000 thing
but the other side of the equation that
is easy to ignore is you want a buyer of
these leads that has a nationwide brand
or else you're going to be juggling like
hundreds of relationships with these
blue collar business owners that are
super flaky you know such a good point
so if you can find this vend diagram
overlap of like high ticket high volume
High search volume low competition and
Nationwide Brands where you can talk to
one person and he's like I've got 362
locations in all these cities we'll buy
everything you send us that is the gold
mine and and I think they do exist but
it's hard to find and the other the
other asterisk here is what is like
what is Google's AI going to do to this

[44:00]
what is Google's AI going to do to this
yeah 100% that's also why I think there
be a bigger push again to YouTube like
at the end of the day you need some
level of discoverability all I'll say at
least while we're speaking here today in
July 17th 2024 like I I am not super
worried about that off the bat like you
Google stuff right now and they show you
their AI prompts and like I think
Google's doing a big disservice to
themselves right now in my personal
opinion because their AI so GED stuff is
so bad that and I don't know if you
agree with this but like it's quite
literally trained me to automatically
skip over it and go to what I'm used to
what I'm familiar with now don't get me
wrong over the next 10 years younger
Generations maybe gets better maybe they
start looking at it first and they're
like oh know it's better and then we get
made fun of for being the old people who
don't doesn't read the AI prompt because
it was bad when we first saw it like
totally valid but I think there's enough
of a cash grab window in the short term
and I think that there's there's always
going to be people who need to find
people and and have like discoverability

[45:01]
people and and have like discoverability
via Google via something yeah and I
think no matter what Google does with AI
I think the the localization is
important because like I was looking up
one of these Search terms in Clarksville
Tennessee and let's just say it was it
was Fence Repair Clarksville Tennessee
and there were none right and this isn't
act this isn't true but it was some
Service in Clarksville Tennessee and
there were zero locations whereas you
would think Clarksville there's like
100,000 people you would think there
would be three right and so if I'm
Google's Ai and I want to show you the
best answer and someone's searching
Fence Repair Clarksville Tennessee even
that like programmatic website they're
going to show you because what else are
they going to show you whereas if you're
competing on a worldwide or a nationwide
level they might like all those little
gimmicks and hacks they might not ever
get shown in the new AI right they might
show you the most relevant thing and
only one instead of pages of 10 another
thing that I like about this
programmatic idea is I compare it to
like rollups private Equity rollups I
love rollups because there's so many

[46:01]
love rollups because there's so many
Industries to roll up and so it's like
there's not a lot of competition in a
lot of these like I heard a podcast
about a guy that rolled up music schools
only in Denver and sold it for $40
million right like who's thinking of
rolling up music schools they like let's
do Self Storage let's roll up dentists
let's like all the obvious stuff but
there's still thousands of industries
that will be rolled up and some of them
might take two decades just because
there's so many and people don't think
of it and so I think of this opportunity
that same way where yeah the the growth
hackers and the gray hat guys and the
black hat Wizard and all those guys have
heard about this and they've been doing
this for years but there's still so many
random niches and opportunities that
they haven't even thought of yet yeah
and also like that's just the nature of
it right like there are more popping up
every single day if you started a Le gen
for people to sign up for their first
High rocks race right like new industry
brand new thing like people people want
that and so like if you have a great
topical Authority for how to get fit and

[47:00]
topical Authority for how to get fit and
like do it in an evergreen Niche you'll
always have more opportunities I think
afterwards and that's also why people
always stress the email list stuff and
being able to own your audience like
there are certainly benefits and
advantages towards that as well I was
just mentioning the rollup part in
general not to do Rel conversation but
one thing that I think is pretty cool is
I was having conversations with this one
guy down in South Florida last Christmas
and he is starting a franchise where all
he does is he buys chiropractor shops I
think in terms of like business models
and changing you know everyone who owns
and buys software is very familiar with
the reoccurring Revenue model and how
that can increase multiples and how
that's like such a good business model
he's buying chiropractor shops and all
he's doing is he's changing the pricing
model from you know if it's I don't know
what the numbers are so I'm going to get
this wrong let's say it's $120 to visit
a chiropractor and and you go once a
month he's going to charge people $200

[48:01]
month he's going to charge people $200
per month on a reoccurring revenue and
you got unlimited cracks let's be honest
you know certain things this works
really better well with others it
doesn't AMC launches their Movie Pass
like do you want to go to the movie
theaters more than two times a month to
make it worth it probably not but on the
contrary too like I know people who buy
car washes and they sell an unlimited
Car Wash plan because you're paying $15
for your normal Car Wash but what if you
pay 25 and every time you drove by you
can get it done well guess what the cost
of water and soap is negligible and the
amount of times that you're actually
going to use it versus it being nice in
theory is low and so I like the idea too
of taking those businesses that are
usually oneoff and there there's
something you do on a reoccurring basis
but like not crazy often and saying do
it unlimited numbers of times but you're
also going to be paying a monthly
subscription that's Genius Like and he's
of course he's he's doing that because
it's already proven out like it just
works right it works in Dustin Florida
it's going to work in bellw Washington

[49:00]
it's going to work in bellw Washington
you can do it with like Teeth Whitening
too like unlimited yeah I mean do do you
yeah I don't know why there was such a
dumb thought on mine I was like do you
need to get it done more than once but
yeah I drink enough coffee that I can
imagine getting it done more than once
would be helpful what about haircuts you
just got the haircut you coming in with
a fresh cut would you pay something I
wouldn't because I'm so cheap dude I go
like three months between haircuts just
because I get busy and I don't I don't
really care what my hair looks like I'm
married what do I got to worry about
that's a fair point I also but that is I
do like that idea though I think it
would work in New York I also think it
would work well because the type of
person that wants a lot of haircuts
throughout the month has shorter hair
and so it's not like it would take super
long especially if you're going frequent
enough where it's like hey not a whole
hell of a lot has happened in the last
week but like I just want to get like
lined up before Friday night out or
something like that yeah I'm wondering
like how you could go into like a barber
shop and have them test just so you
could like be a passive Observer and see
if it works then once it works it's like
all right I'm going to buy a thousand
barber
shops I yeah I bet it would work yeah

[50:02]
shops I yeah I bet it would work yeah
100% there's got to be one out there
that does that I would have to think I
bet there is reach out to them see see
if life's Better or Worse they're like
