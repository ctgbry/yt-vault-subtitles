welcome to the ker office guys I don't
know if my excitement or my energy comes
through this podcast but I just love
doing this like you notice I'm doing a
lot more interviews with recurring
guests that have a ton of business ideas
like I do let me know if you like these
if you're getting sick of these guests
if you're getting sick of too many ideas
maybe we're not going deep enough I
really want to hear because I love doing
it like I love going deep with one
business owner about his or her industry
that only gets you so far I like talking
about ideas and specifically how to tie
distribution and or launch strategies
with those ideas so you're not just left
empty-handed with an idea and no way to
implement it that's what I like to do so
let me know Chris at co-founders decom
if I should keep leaning into episodes
like these that are idea and execution
heavy or if I should keep leaning into
episodes with one founder where we go
deep on his business I want to know I
like them both honestly but the idea
ones with recurring guests really give
me a lot of energy and I think that
energy makes for a better product in the
end so today I had Connor back on Connor
was on we talked about programmatic SEO
together he's an entrepreneur living in
New York he owns self storage businesses

[01:00]
New York he owns self storage businesses
recruiting business and an e-commerce
business and a bunch of other things and
we man we had a two-part episode first
one today next one a week from today and
we talked today we talked about a grill
cleaning business okay which is a thing
we're not inventing this but we
brainstormed some ideas on how you could
make this a higher margin and a more
scalable business and then we talked
about an a podcasting AB test agency
business where you could charge one to
five grand a month to work for
podcasters or YouTube YouTubers to help
find which clips from their videos or
audio segments are the most likely to
resonate or go viral and then I think we
add one or two other kind of pseudo
ideas thrown in there but let me know
what you think about these types and we
will see you next
[Music]
time all right Connor well thank you for
coming on the ker office we're going to
talk some business ideas today and tell
me what the categories you have are
again in terms of like the revenue
amount uhhuh so I do this for my
newsletter sometimes and and I think

[02:00]
newsletter sometimes and and I think
it's just an easy way because not every
idea is a billion dollar idea and so I
like to make things super actionable
from like you can do it and make Revenue
today to you're going to have to put
some time and energy into this to
actually make this a real company but
the categories are I've got $100,000
year idea got one $1 million a year idea
and that one might be a sneaky one like
that one could probably be a $200
million a year business if done right
but we'll get to that in a second and
then the last two I would call our
reliable $10 million a year businesses
that if you do it right and you execute
well and you go after the market you
will make $10 million a year and I feel
pretty strongly about that oh I feel
like we we should come up with a ratio
or something where it's like you take
the potential capital investment
required and the potential outcome and
you divide it and it's like a a scoring
system that could be good yeah but even
because even there's so many ideas and
I've it takes me a little bit of time to
realize this that like if you just do
them and you just execute for long
enough you'll grow the business like
it's it's a time thing and like there

[03:01]
it's it's a time thing and like there
are people way dumber than you and I who
are making way more money because
they've been in this business for 20 20
plus years but there also other
businesses where you might go so hard at
it and then just realize hey there are
only so many swimmers ear supplements
that I can sell because only x x number
of people get swimmers here every single
year right like it's a very capped
market and I feel like most of these are
pretty much constrained around that or
the fact that like scaling gets more
expensive than it's worth okay now when
you say something is a $100,000 year
idea does that mean like that is the
ceiling or like that is the ceiling
before like really having to change your
strategy before you can scale it like
it's a lot harder to scale past 100
because in my opinion like basically
anything you can scale to an extent I
think you can sell
$100,000 of literally anything the time
and speed by which it takes to get to
that 100,000 I think is the factor so I
mean like we can get into this idea and
I'm I'd be curious just based on what

[04:00]
I'm I'd be curious just based on what
you were saying here of like there are
probably a lot of ways to make this idea
a lot better and specifically I want to
brainstorm about the upsells because
that's I think how you get past 100,000
but this is someone I it's post Labor
Day now so like start planning and maybe
get after it come time April of next
year but I just got back I live in
Manhattan right now my parents have a
spot down to the Jersey Shore and
something that I was doing a lot this
past weekend was grilling and I'm
realizing like man I'll go to the
grocery store before a long week with
some friends and I and we'll buy like
$300 of just like Mis every form of
miscellaneous meat like steaks dogs
Burgers sausages chicken whatever and by
the end of the weekend the grill looks
nasty there is chunks of things there
are like smokes stains everywhere and
you do that for a long enough time and
you get a pretty gnarly looking Grill
spent a little bit of time on Reddit
over the weekend was also talking to my
dad and I don't know who he contacted I
should have gotten more information
about this but they have a nice Grill
like I don't want to downplay and make
it seem like it's a regular Grill they
have a nice Grill but he spent $300 to

[05:02]
have a nice Grill but he spent $300 to
get this Grill cleaned and I got me
think I was like hey that's a ton I was
like that's a lot of money B like you
got to think like you do that once a
year or whatever at some point you're
better off just buying a new grill every
four or five years but is there a price
point where you can sell this service
for $200 a year somebody comes in they
do a deep clean of all of the grates get
the smoke stains off maybe there is a
propane upsell or you know hey I'll
change that thing out for a 30 fee I
think if you do the math out on this
like the rough napkin math of what I was
calculating was you had $200 per just at
least up here in the Northeast different
down where you're at in Texas but at
least up in the Northeast this is a
six-month a year type of business let's
say that you do two a day so you're
knocking out 12 a week right maybe a
little bit more maybe a little bit less
that's about 75 grand a year and if
you're a college kid you're a high
school kid or just kind of home for the
summer looking to make a couple extra
bucks that is very good money for not
working the entire entire year so this

[06:00]
working the entire entire year so this
is this $100,000 a year business right
like at some point you got to start
thinking to yourself all right if I want
to scale this up I got have to hire some
going to do sales some going to sub out
the work to like it starts eating out
and that's why it might not make a whole
lot of sense to scale but I'd love to
hear from your perspective like what are
some things that we can add on to this
business to make it that 100,000 $
250,000 $500,000 a year business even
just within one local market okay love
it what I love about this business is
the visual aspect of it the before and
after sells it's a beautiful before and
after picture you know Isaac French on
Twitter yep he just had that tweet go
insanely viral 22 million views about
the train car that he renovated Paul
Graham retweeted it everyone did he
thinks the main reason is because his
first pitcher was a before and after
pitcher of the train car and it just
speaks to find a business find a niche
that relies on a before and after
pictures and you'll win right agreed
wait L supplements they know what

[07:00]
wait L supplements they know what
they're doing okay so I love that part
about it I have a theory that like you
need the right tools to do a great job
anything you do whether it's a software
tool or or a manual tool I feel like you
could speed this process up with the
right tools maybe it's like a Dremel
tool or a sander attached to a brush and
you could have like a rectangular bucket
full of soap and just it's shaped like
the grills and so you could fully
submerge it you could have one being
submerged while you're scrubbing the
other one I feel like you could really
hack this this to speed up the cleaning
process where a homeowner might spend
three hours doing it you could do it in
30 minutes at that point 200 is really
attractive it's 400 bucks an hour so I I
like that aspect of it couple things on
that that you just said you know from
the visual standpoint I don't know about
you but like if I'm listening to some
kind of like ASMR video it's without a
doubt the pressure watching videos that
you just see the oddly satisfying guy go
up and down the driveway and you're like
yeah like I'm watching this over any
other Tik Tok out there so I can see
this absolutely applying for Grill

[08:02]
this absolutely applying for Grill
cleaning as far as how can you speed it
up right because yeah most things that I
was reading was talking about how it
takes a good three hours but it's
primarily the great it's primarily where
you're actually cooking the thing that's
being exposed to both the food and the
flame that you're cleaning a lot I
wonder if you can do something similar
to the subcontractors who are recharging
all of these bird and lime scooters
where you get a truck you get a bunch of
shelves on that truck and you drive
around a neighborhood or you fly up a
neighborhood whatever it looks like and
say hey I'm doing this I'm going to be
the cheapest in the area because I do it
this way I'll come by on Monday I'll
come back on Thursday before it's grill
time and I'm going to pick up all of
your grates and I'll sweep the entire
neighborhood at once I'll make sure it's
labeled you're getting your grate back
whatever because I think the way you
have to do it is I think you have to
like drop it in some form of like
cleaning solution or acid for a couple
of hours and that's probably the biggest
bottleneck so can you bring it back
somewhere where you just drop all of

[09:00]
somewhere where you just drop all of
them in there at once and you kind of do
it overnight and then slowly return them
and as you're returning them is when you
finish it off with an extra polish so I
think that might decrease your
fulfillment costs that's an amazing idea
I like that one a lot you treat it like
a in Scouts we used to do a canned food
drive right where it's like all right
we're going to be back put your canned
vegetables out on the doorstep we'll be
here on Tuesday it's like hey I'll be in
your backyard next Tuesday to grab your
grates so many puns you could do in this
business you could call it great success
like Bor g a t
great success you can have like a
commercial vacuum right where like it's
I'm picturing like a blower but it's a
vacuum on your back and you roll up you
grab the grates you put them in your
bucket you you suck out all the stuff
that you're leaving behind it takes five
minutes then you leave with the grates
you put like an identifying tag on the
grates maybe it's a color maybe it's a
number you gather them all up you don't
need to schedule times you just need
them to opt into it and then you take
them back to your Warehouse you soak
them overnight you use like a a pressure

[10:01]
them overnight you use like a a pressure
washer you just lay them out just clean
them all like your fulfillment time per
unit could be like five minutes in that
case completely so I think that's how
you can maybe get this point or this
product or this service to a point where
you can scale it because if you can
reduce the Fulfillment cost enough then
you can start hiring people to help you
sub out some of the work so that's
decreasing the cost which is the
scalability issue right what about the
other side which is like can you get a
reliable
service where you're making more money
than just the $200 and so other ideas
that come to mind there you know propane
tank Replacements like that one's a
little bit tough because like I I can't
confidently say if somebody's coming to
the grill and they say hey just by the
way I noticed that your propane tank
feels a little light I've got another
one in the car you want me to swap it
out that could work recycling propane
tanks is expensive but like obviously
you can just swap them out at your local
gas station $25 upsell from that that's
an extra 10% on everything that you're

[11:01]
an extra 10% on everything that you're
making other ideas that come to mind the
obvious one that kind of feels a little
weird but it's like hey see you're
cooking a lot of meat do you want to buy
seasoning that feels a little off like I
don't know if I'd buy a product as much
from my service provider but I could say
like something I've been seeing pretty
often pop up this summer is a lot of
people talk about kind of like
marinating SL cleaning a grill with an
onion so what you do is you cut the
onion in half stab it with the back of a
fork and kind of scrape it up and down
along it maybe there's something that
you can do with like onion juice spray
to sell to people where it's like hey
this keeps your grill Clean Plus also
marinates it that alone might be a good
product idea but something to kind of
increase that upsale value maybe it's in
the outdoor area of the house and
another cleaning service I don't know I
got an idea for you so I'm currently in
the market for this so we've got a grill
I've lived here eight years I've cleaned
it myself like half-heartedly I've never
had it professionally cleaned
desperately needs it so first of all if
someone put a flyer on my door I would
I'd be a buyer okay period because it
would remove the friction I don't have

[12:01]
would remove the friction I don't have
to think about it research anyone yada
yada yada but as far as upsells are
concerned I would say all right the my
customers are already the type of person
that is grilling outside okay so I'm
just going to lean into that so I would
go to Alibaba and buy you know like the
oi pizza ovens have you seen those yeah
yeah yeah yeah or Rock boxes those are
like $5 to $700 but you can find
aftermarket or offbrand identical copies
of those on AliExpress for $150
and they were great some are wood pellet
fired some are propane fired so you
could order a shipment of those and you
could have a van the same van that
you're using to collect all the grades
it's like a mini e-commerce fulfillment
center you at all times you keep three
to four pizza ovens you could get like
custom grilled tool set like really
high-end ones but with good margin
because you're getting it from China or
you could go find like these Instagram
accounts that post viral videos of like
kitchen tools that's just and go find
the videos that are the most viral
that's like a kitchen or a grill tool go

[13:01]
that's like a kitchen or a grill tool go
buy those from AliExpress and you just
have these racks in your van it's just
like this mini e-commerce site it's like
hey we're all done do you want any and
you just like you open up your coat do
you want a pizza oven do you want Grill
tools like yeah yeah because you can
Mark a $100 mark up the pizza $100 and
it's still 300 cheaper than an uni and
that increases your margin by 50% just
with that one up sell no completely
agreed on that all right if you are
watching this clip right now you are
watching this on YouTube YouTube and if
you are a fan of podcast please check
out my podcast while you're at it
because sometimes I have podcasts that
aren't on YouTube and sometimes I have
YouTubes that aren't on podcast so check
out the ker office on any podcast
platform or you can go to TKO pod.com
also my newsletter will throw that in
there there are no ads It's weekly it's
different content than my podcast and
YouTube newsletter. chrisj cerner.com
You'll see the link and we'll see you
there yeah and I think the other thing
too to think about is like are there
other things like I know for I'm just
thinking of like my parents kitchen now
like you're talking about kind of a
physical heart goods and I think that

[14:00]
physical heart goods and I think that
there's absolutely a market there but
like can you get more out of the service
if you're already there as well too like
things that I'm thinking of that they
have would be everything from like an
outdoor fridge does that need a scrub
down for an extra
$30 pressure coolers pressure washing
yeah I think there's a lot of stuff and
I like the idea of making the slightly
more unique no brainer maybe one one
time a year service and that gets your
foot in the door and then how can you
land and expand that and people who own
grills probably own other types of
things uh that need cleaning or they're
willing to pay money good money to get
things deep clean so I think that
there's definitely an opportunity to
expand a little bit more into there I
like that a lot your customers are also
someone that likes to keep things clean
right so that person is probably a
person that's more likely to get regular
pressure washing done yep right whereas
me a freaking cheap skate I own a
pressure washer and I don't get anyone
to clean my grill because I'm cheap so
I'm probably not a good customer for
that but if they're paying for one
they'll probably pay for the other so I

[15:00]
they'll probably pay for the other so I
love that idea to me it looks a lot like
a Christmas light business where it's
like you have a generalized service like
lawn mowing or uh pressure washing for
this the hot month and then you have a
more Niche service like Christmas light
or grill cleaning for the other months
the other season I really think that
there's also I'm just thinking like now
i' got myself thinking about like the
flavoring of the great I don't know like
I used spend some time down in Austin
have a friend who is really good at
cooking and he G build up I remember
this one time salmon on like some kind
of flavored wooden block do you know
what I'm talking about yeah they're
Cedar palletes I think that could
totally work well I don't know I think
you did it on the grill they're not like
the chips like it was like literally
like a oh okay it looks like a cutting
board right yes yeah and you put it on
the gr and then you put the salmon on
that and it like infuses it with flavor
so I like that idea as well just from
the standpoint of like that is a product
that's also a consumable that over time
they're going to go through and if
you're saying hey you're using this

[16:00]
you're saying hey you're using this
thing a ton you know increase the
lifespan cook some more of your stuff on
these flavored pallets now next thing
maybe they're calling you back to get
another pallet and hey while you're here
you want to clean the grill as well just
try to find a lot of different angles to
attack it from I like that yeah I said
pallet I meant plank it's like a plank
okay right it's like four by eight
inches or so M yeah yeah yeah I like
that a lot yeah you could have a van
full of those
too can I give you an idea this idea is
like four hours old okay this is a this
is a live release I'll give you the
downside of this idea first I'm going to
crap on it before I even give it to you
and what category is this idea is if you
had to put it in one 100K 1 million 10
million I'm going to say a million the
one downside of this business is the who
the customer is and the customer is like
creators or podcasters and I don't
really like selling to that audience
because 99% podcast don't make any or
don't have any money right yeah but
there are still lots of podcast soft
products or agencies out there that do

[17:00]
products or agencies out there that do
really well because some people just
want to have a good podcast whether it
makes money or not right so here's the
idea I have social accounts called at
the ker office on all the platforms to
and the the whole idea originally was to
just post generated AI generated clips
from my podcast to the platforms to push
traffic to my podcast but then I thought
let's just make original short form
videos and direct people to my podcast
and that's worked a lot better I don't
regret doing that but I just heard what
does his name Steven Bartlett Diary of a
CEO so one thing that he does I got this
idea from him the original idea he'll
like post a bunch of Clips AI generated
to his podcast to learn what parts of
the podcast are the most interesting and
then he'll either promote the podcast
that way or he'll edit out the parts
that aren't interesting and so I'm not
positive but I'm pretty sure he's
putting out these AI generated Clips
before that podcast episode ever goes
live so he knows how to edit it how to
promote it smart yep right so what I

[18:02]
promote it smart yep right so what I
just started doing today is I created
second Instagram Tik Tok YouTube shorts
accounts called K ker office Clips where
I'm only going to post AI generated
clips from stuff like this me and you
talking sometimes it's you talking
sometimes me sometimes both one head on
the top one head on the bottom and and
then plenty of softwares out there will
add in Boll they'll add in captions and
all that right for instance I'm going to
do this today after we're done I'm GNA
upload this whole episode into the
software it's going to spit out five to
15 clips and I'm G to upload all of them
basically at the same time to all three
platforms because I don't care about
these platforms I have zero followers I
don't care and then I'm just going to
look at the retention and it's like okay
oh interesting everyone loved that Grill
idea I'm gonna make the title The Grill
idea everyone loved this no one cares
about that but I thought that was the
most interesting part I guess it's not
because the thing about YouTube Tik Tok
and Instagram even if you have zero it's
going to show it to hundreds or

[19:00]
going to show it to hundreds or
thousands of people regardless and then
you're going to know like for instance I
did this for the first time today with
an episode I had with Sam Thompson that
hasn't aired yet and I only did two
clips we were talking about the same
kind of idea but just kind of different
parts of the idea and one of them was a
clear winner across all three platforms
and I'm like that's an AB test I didn't
know you could AB test podcast right
yeah so the idea here is to be an agency
that just does this
right it's like just send me your raw
files give me your Riverside login and
I'll create the social accounts for you
or you create them and you share it with
me and I'm just going to send you a
weekly report of okay you've got three
these three episodes coming out next
week these need to be your angles here's
your data I did it all for you what do
you think I think what you're saying is
100% right which is we're going to find
the part of the episode that maybe you
didn't even think was the most
interesting but it's actually going to
be the most interesting but we're going
to find that just through sheer brute
force of it's an hourong episode we're
going to take 20 clips and they going to

[20:00]
going to take 20 clips and they going to
be 5 minutes each or something like that
and we're going to publish all of them
we're going to kill the losers we're
going to double down on the winners
that's effectively what you're saying
and I think that is very smart I think
to your point the downside is I also
like as a business owner not so cheap as
a podcaster very cheap and so like we
Outsource all of our editing overseas
and I'm kind of banking on a combination
of like my notes during a podcast
episode of like oh just said this thing
like when Chris said the words the dog
runs like that's when we start the clip
but like that's the only way that I do
it today there's not a better way and I
think to your point there absolutely
should be a better way I think if you
want to even double down on this a
little bit more and you want some a
version of this that I absolutely know
people would be willing to pay for it
would have to be for ads specifically
video ads and like trying to test out
Hooks and angles and offers and all of
that stuff and do it through the lens of

[21:01]
that stuff and do it through the lens of
organic because I'm sure like just like
myself like you've probably scrolled
like you are into ultra running soon you
definitely have seen this then I'm sure
you've probably been on Instagram and
you've seen do you have knee pain or
don't you just hate when you get that
planter fast Ed satday in the morning
you start watching immediately because
you're like yeah that's very relatable
to me but it also could be organic
content so trying to test the same exact
ad piece of content whatever with like
20 30 different hooks seeing what gets
the longest watch time I've been working
with a couple advertising agencies
lately on the recruiting side where this
is super valuable for them like I had a
conversation literally yesterday where
he's like hey if somebody gets me an
extra five seconds of watch time on this
ad that's probably a million dollar
decision would I pay more for that
absolutely and so I think that's maybe
another angle that you can go at it with
from a service standpoint I think it's
super valuable like a lot of the
podcasts that I record like I did one
with uh Casey Miracle last and it's all
about like real estate options trading
and stuff like that big part of that

[22:01]
and stuff like that big part of that
podcast was less so the 52 minute long
episode and I cared a lot more about the
seven really great clips that I was
going to get out of that the question I
think just comes down to like who's
going to pay for it I love the ad idea
because like you said I mean you have an
e-commerce business $500 a Day ad budget
is it's like it's funny how that works
too right like have you ever seen the
memes where it's like $20 burger at the
restaurant and it's like oh as opposed
to like losing $2,000 in crypto it's
like ah whatever it's kind of like it's
like oh geez I need this new Chrome
extension it's 8 a month H is it worth
it I don't know but then you bump your
ads from five to $700 a day like we're
talking 17,000 a month which a lot of
money to anyone in the world and you
just don't even give it a second thought
so for a podcaster to spend $2,500 a
month on this service to like maybe get
more downloads maybe get more retention
right but for an ads guy an agency or an

[23:00]
right but for an ads guy an agency or an
Ecom brand owner or any business owner
that's running ads maybe they're only
spending 3,000 a month maybe they're
three spending 300,000 a month that's a
drop in the bucket to them what about
and this is not your idea exactly but
this is kind of where my mind's going
now have you seen people who use fake
podcasts as hooks yes yes so I know I
came across one I'm forgetting what the
brand itself was but they did the iconic
like red velvet folded curtain in the
background that kind of made it look
like they were on Rogan and they weren't
and they had the headset on and they had
the mic and like they very clearly were
not on Joe Rogan because it was like soy
it was like just edited enough but like
from the default it looks like the
background that guests always have on
Joe Rogan and I've even like for a
friend who runs a supplement brand
before jumped on and he's like hey can
you kind of like ask me these questions
or like ask questions that you think
would be good and I'm going to answer on
Zoom with like my background whatever so
maybe there's some kind of opportunity
as well with like an ad creative agency

[24:00]
as well with like an ad creative agency
this is not your idea at all but just
totally random an ad creative agency
that specifically deals with podcast
style hooks that can kind of capture you
in from the beginning so that way like
when you're watching this you're
scrolling because because objectively
like podcasts are interesting content
and this is what you're trying to do
anyway to get the most downloads like
what can you say that makes it look like
you're in the middle of the conversation
that randomly plugs your product at the
end if you started off with the
conversation here today and you're like
man I found the number one gas station
in the country every other gas station
can go to hell because like I found the
one and it was coming across this time
when I was taking my family we were in
an RV trip and I stopped off and I
stopped off of at one of 83 different
stalls or or pumps and I walked in and I
was like damn I got to get this stuff
everywhere and then I found there's
actually this site you can get it online
it's called you know Texas snacks.com
mhm like you watch that doesn't feel
like an ad doesn't read like an ad
switch yes but it's objectively like the

[25:02]
switch yes but it's objectively like the
the thing so I wonder I don't know you
said like I think the Rogan part of sley
I think that this could be a pretty good
idea from a yeah if hey pay me 10 grand
and we will record 80 different Hooks
and our team of writers and creative
strategists will'll come up with a ton
of different stories and angles that you
can tell we'll pause 15 minutes in you
can swap out your shirt and hat to make
it look like a different thing to reduce
creative fatigue have you walk into the
other room to change up the background
like there's definitely ways to do it
where I think you can probably get more
out of it that's a really good idea in
fact I want to steal that copy for a
Texas snacks video do it yeah it's like
wait what gas station is it WWA is it
bies is it racetrack is it quick trip
and it's like they're not feeling like
they're being sold to at all yeah right
exactly yeah and I think that's the
whole point of it right like I I don't
know they matter of times that you'll
hear someone some nutrition person going
on for a while and then the last thing
they say is that greens and you're like
ah I knew it there's definitely

[26:01]
ah I knew it there's definitely
some something there but I I do think
that to just to Circle back to your
original point an original idea there's
value there I think it just is a
question of like where the value is and
it's it's kind of like a Pik fues
service you know piku right yeah I've
used them not for a while I need to use
them more so I mean people people
listening like quick 10-second overview
Pik fu is an not AB testing kind of AB
testing you put up two variations of
something and you give them your ideal
demographics of who you want the opinion
from and they will get you customer
feedback on which one that person
prefers so you're basically just doing
the most tried and true version of that
and putting it to the algorithm from day
one because it's free to actually have
the algorithm tested versus the credits
that I think pick F charges and I like
the idea a lot like I would want to be a
customer if I had a budget bigger
content budget essentially how many
podcasts are there do you think that
make call it $500,000 a year in ads it's

[27:03]
make call it $500,000 a year in ads it's
very much a power law let's say all how
many categories are there because in
business you've got like 30 categories
within business marketing management
entrepreneurship let's say there's 200
categories and maybe the top 50 in all
of them make good money top 50 podcasts
in each c yeah the only thing I would
say is I think there were probably some
categories that make dramatically more
than others like I I actually just
looked this up today Tim charges
$50,000 per ad sometimes have five ads
in an episode that's $250,000 per
episode the man puts out two episodes a
week that's $500,000 times 52 that's a
good change yeah right so yeah from the
power loss standpoint I think the top
guys make a lot of money and would
absolutely pay for this and probably pay
a pretty premium service for it would
have to be a premium service because I
think it's such a small Market but I
mean like even your like this podcast I
think is like correct me if I'm wrong

[28:01]
think is like correct me if I'm wrong
like you guys broke at least for a week
top 50 on the business charts right like
we we got to 30 on Spotify we peaked at
30 but the charts are kind of misleading
because it's it depends on Apple and
Spotify but it uses like new subscriber
or follower velocity right so like
transparently I just told you what my
download numbers were they're not a
secret like I was top I was number 30 on
Spotify getting like 20 2500 downloads
per episode and to me like that's not
very much like if I were to like go sell
ads to this right now it's like maybe
100 Grand a year maybe yeah I was I was
G to say like you got to think what
you're charging $50 per
CPM 120 bucks an episode but then like
brand value YouTube you I can do three
per episode and then you roll in YouTube
but it's like okay if I'm making 100
Grand a year Top Line I'm not going to
pay someone $2,500 a month to like
increase my that's a third of my Revenue

[29:00]
increase my that's a third of my Revenue
right but let's say there's let's say
the top 25 of each of the 200 categories
that's 5,000 people 5,000 podcasts that
are that's your Tam potential market and
I would bet almost none of them are
doing this themselves I don't think any
agencies are really doing this if there
are they're not really heard of you get
you know we'll we'll play the the
spreadsheet porn game which I hate but
that's really the only way you can do it
if you get 1% of that market that's 50
customers 2 200 bucks a month 75 grand a
month it could be a million dollar
business with 1% of the market totally
yes I I do agree with that I think you
can make a million dollars I think with
all of these things right this is where
kind of like that how big can the
business be you got to figure out what's
an easier way to make a million dollars
and then I think try to chase the
easiest things but I completely agree
especially if you have an in with a lot
of these guys to start then I think I
would do it without a question there are
a lot of upsells I like the idea of like
can you upsell lead magnet then get them
on an email and then who's managing
their email and how are they selling ads
in the email should you be selling ads
in the email for them like one of those

[30:00]
in the email for them like one of those
businesses to get them in the door
cheaply and then scale up with them
assuming that you find success here's
something interesting that's not an idea
but it's a scam that Nick and I just
came across we get Podcast every or
emails every single day maybe five times
a week of hey we want to have this
entrepreneur on your podcast because
they're so accomplished we wanted them
on your podcast or it's like hey we want
you to come on our podcast we get 10,000
downloads a month and so Nick was just
on a podcast and I won't say which but
they were claiming to get half a million
downloads a month and you can go to pod
status.com and you can see where
someone's been ranked like you can pay
Bots to fake your ranking for like a few
days at a time like anyone can pay a 100
bucks to to get a bunch of fake
subscribers but then you really cannot
sustain that okay but what you can do is
you can pay bot for downloads and
listens and it looks legit and you can
pick the country they come from so one
thing that I'm seeing people do is
they're paying $5 to $20 for 10,000

[31:01]
they're paying $5 to $20 for 10,000
quote downloads and then like Shopify
comes around and says hey you know what
are your rates we want because yeah
because they sh they sponsor every
podcast and you're like oh here's my a
screenshot from Buzz Sprout I'm getting
500,000 downloads a month they like okay
here's 10 grand here's 20 grand and it's
all fake that sucks it's all a lie so
first of all I think that's super
unethical to give you the similar
version to that it's numbers game
podcast should I say the name yeah I'll
say the name cuz I don't think it really
matters and I don't really care there's
this real estate podcast called best
ever CR do you know about guys nope two
years back and in hindsight like I think
just everyone goes on that show or like
a lot of real estate people the reason
you haven't heard about them is because
I don't think the shows are good I think
that like it was a 30 minute episode the
guy sounds like he got out of bed when
he started recording it he asked me like
four of the most softball layup no
research done questions I've ever heard
of and he's like all right that's a rep
and whatever like finished up the

[32:01]
and whatever like finished up the
episode and I was like damn what a waste
of my time what a waste of your time
what a waste of the listener's time like
no one's happy with this and I was
talking to somebody else three months
ago and that name came up again and I
found out they do all of these podcast
episodes because it's such a big SEO
game for them where whenever somebody
search like if you search my name
probably somewhere along the lines that
podcast episode does show up and they
have a really elaborate funnel and big
big big top of funnel to get a bunch of
people who are interested in real estate
into their funnel and buying their
courses or buying their advisory
services and I supposedly that makes a
lot of money not good content but a lot
at the top of the funnel and then slowly
moves you down which I think I don't
think that's unethical I just think that
it's not what I would want to do yeah
but yeah's kind of interesting yeah I
mean paying Bots for downloads and then
selling ads based on that's outright
fraud in my opinion it is it's 100%
fraud it can be suited for that while
we're talking about fraud there's this

[33:00]
we're talking about fraud there's this
one guy that I did a bunch of digging on
I won't say who his name is because I
don't want to get sued but have you ever
heard a social blade yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah it's like a tool where you can go
back in time and see how many followers
anyone on the internet has gained over
time really interest you posted this
like a year or a couple months ago right
I did I did this guy has like you yes he
had millions of followers and he
interviews very bigname people like very
bigname people and I went and looked at
the social blade and if you see like you
know it's possible theoretically
possible on Instagram to get 100,000
followers in a day if something goes
really viral but something has to go
really viral and so this guy added like
millions of followers over the course of
like four or five days with nothing
going viral and it's very very easy to
buy fake followers on Instagram very
easily and then you can see in the
comments all the comments are fake
they're just all fire emojis it's very
easy to see in the comments that it's
fake so this guy's fake he's completely
fake he's never done anything real in
business and he charging
$7,500 per appearance and he's doing

[34:01]
$7,500 per appearance and he's doing
three a day a day and so it's like he
scammed his way into being legit because
I doubt he charges Grant Cardone right
and so now these important people see
other people that are not quite as
important that paid a lot of money that
no one advertises and they're like oh
this guy must be legit so it's like it's
kind of like Catch Me If You Can right
he's like he fakes being a pilot he
fakes being a surgeon and then before
you know it he actually is a surgeon he
faked it until he actually made it but
it was all built on lies so would I do
that no do I think and the biggest
question here s the biggest flaw here is
the fact that people are paying money
and being manipulated around how many
people are actually watching it now so
so that's the unethical that is the pure
fraud part of it especially if asked
right if you say hey are all these
downloads legit I want to spend
sponsorship money and you say yes that's
illegal the thing that I probably don't
have as of a moral qualm with and I've
never done it but like I I wouldn't be

[35:01]
never done it but like I I wouldn't be
against it is if you did that and you
did that as a measure to try to attract
bigger name guests and you don't run ads
and you don't charge people to be on the
show I I can live them with it myself I
think if I did that yeah like kind of
try like to be honest with you I'm doing
the YouTube stuff with the real estate
podcast or the real estate show that
we're doing right now and something that
I'm I'm realizing now is when we were
running the Next Generation podcast that
would get like 2 to 3,000 downloads per
episode and like I don't know two years
into doing it at that level I was like
ah this is just like it's not growing as
much as I want to and you know as well
like podcasts are hard to grow so I
wanted to go YouTube first this time and
we're getting more natural and organic
downloads without me having to promote
it as much but the downside of going
YouTube first is that when you invite
guests onto the show and they saw that
the last episode got 20 views it's like
hey who Am I who am I doing this for you
and me yeah the podcast like it's
actually kind of a benefit that the
views are hidden because you can say hey

[36:00]
views are hidden because you can say hey
just look at the names of who I've had
on so I think that's kind of interesting
it is interesting it's like podcasts are
still such Uncharted Territory oh yeah
okay what' you think did I overhype it I
don't think so a week from now we'll
have the second part of this episode
with Connor again where we talk about a
health product to help with endurance
for athletes that's very simple two
ingredients we'll talk about a
construction permit database that you
can pay a little bit of money for to
sell individual lead s to home service
business owners for tens or hundreds of
dollars we talked about how to package
and frame ideas in a different way to
profit and we talked about building
market research reports for Industries
and who could be a buyer of these could
you charge 200 2,000 20,000 200,000 and
then Connor had an amazing idea of
basically taking a gym and using it as
like a wework for personal trainers so a
gym only for personal trainers because
today personal trainers use normal gyms
and the customers are tied to the gym so
they can't really move them between gyms
so I really think you'll like this one a
lot let me know if I should have Conor

[37:00]
lot let me know if I should have Conor
back on and I will and I'm just gonna be
honest even if you say I shouldn't I'm
probably going to anyway because I like
him a lot so but I do want your feedback
enjoy
