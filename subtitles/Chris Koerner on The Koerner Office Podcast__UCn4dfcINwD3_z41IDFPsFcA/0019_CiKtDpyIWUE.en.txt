[00:00]
hey guys just wanted to do something a
little different today so I'm
interviewed about once or twice a month
on various podcasts and frankly most of
them I'm not too impressed with but I
was just interviewed on the millennial
investing podcast and I really liked it
I felt like they asked some really
interesting questions that most people
don't care to ask they did a lot of
research on me and frankly it was a good
listen whereas usually I kind of cringe
listening to my own interviews so the
millennial investing podcast has
interviewed people such as Cody Sanchez
Nick Huber Chris Powers Neil Patel Ken
so it was an honor to be included I hope
you like it let me know if you have any
[Music]
questions co-founders is a vehicle for
me to plant those ideas with other
people and because you know I people
tell me a lot what if you just did one
thing it's like well I do do one thing
and it's start businesses you know I
don't do one business because like I

[01:00]
don't do one business because like I
wouldn't enjoy
that you've got an amazing story and I
really I there's so many directions I
could go right now but I wanted to start
off with being a missionary in Hungary I
wanted to talk about that hear about
that and just some of the lessons you
learned like being a missionary and uh
knocking on doors yeah absolutely so I
am a member of the Church of Jesus
Christ of latterday saints commonly
known as the Mormons and as most people
know we send uh 18 and 19 year olds out
across the whole world for 18 to 24
months to serve others and to talk about
our
church so I got sent to Hungary uh we
don't choose where we go we just kind of
fill out an application I get a medical
screening and submit it and then we're
told where we're going and so I went to
Hungary in 2006 to 2008 so tell me about
that you're you're the what's what's a

[02:01]
that you're you're the what's what's a
average day look like when you're when
you're you're canvasing basically right
and teaching people about you know
you're getting a lot of doors shut in
your face I would imagine the vast
majority yeah so the average day you
wake up at 6:30 um you will read your
scriptures for a half hour uh or maybe
even an hour I don't remember by
yourself and then you'll read your your
scriptures with your companion for 30 to
60 minutes and then you'll go work out
uh for 30 to 60 minutes um maybe it's
lift weights maybe it's you go on a run
and then um you plan your day that takes
about a half hour and then you just you
hit the streets and that looks
differently based on where you are if
you're in Provo Utah then you're
probably not canvasing at all you're
just um handling referrals from other
members if you're in budapes Hungary
you're probably knocking doors or going
to a busy City Center and just approach
people on the street so you obviously
learned Hungarian before you soak off is

[03:02]
learned Hungarian before you soak off is
that how it worked you you studied the
language and then were sent there so you
everyone goes to What's called the
Missionary Training Center there's about
15 of them worldwide the biggest being
in Provo Utah um and that's where you
learn the language if you will be
speaking a different language and it's
just where you learn how to be a
missionary um and you're there for a
minimum depending on where you're going
a minimum of two weeks to a maximum of
used to 12 and today it's closer to 9 so
depending on how hard the language is uh
depends on that that kind of determines
how long you're in the MTC for so I was
in there for the maximum amount time
which is 12 weeks and you're fluent in
the language now I was um but you know
there not a lot of opportunities to
practice Hungarian in Dallas Texas right
um I can understand it much much better
than I could speak it I've been back to
the country twice since coming home in '

[04:00]
the country twice since coming home in '
08 and it's tough like it's it's really
tough because you you just hear it and
you're like okay yeah yeah yeah and then
you just go to respond and it it's just
like spaghetti can't get it out but so
did you meet and become really close
friends with hungarians while you were
there I mean people maybe you who who
did open their door to you and were able
to
listen yeah I mean we were immersed were
you at the time you only called home
twice per year Christmas Mother's Day
and you would write letters or emails
once per week um today it's different
you can call home every Monday um but it
was it was different back then and the
idea was to be completely immersed like
you are one of them you don't have a job
you don't have hobbies you are a
full-time missionary for 18 to 2 I think
I heard you say aren't more
people not able to complete their
assignment now like they not that they
become softer but like it's it's harder
to complete the assignment is that is

[05:00]
to complete the assignment is that is
that accurate to say yeah this is more
of me speaking candidly and off the
Record as as a a general Observer of
Trends in my church and just kind of a a
nerdy stats guy these numbers aren't
published anywhere so I I don't know for
sure but anecdotally it's been pretty
well documented
that call it 10 to 20% of missionaries
go home early today whereas and once
again I don't represent the church these
are these numbers aren't published
anywhere I don't even know if they're
true this is just my total guess but it
used to be closer to low single digits
one to 5% would come home early um no
one really knows why uh I my guess my
complete hunch is that you know social
media and smartphones changed everything
and it's just a much bigger shock to the
culture and the system to go from
constantly connected to not connected at
all yeah um and so it's actually really

[06:03]
all yeah um and so it's actually really
interesting because that trend is
reversing and you're hearing much much
less missionaries come home early and I
think once again totally guessing that
we're just becoming acclimated to it
right like it's this is the new norm and
it's like saw this distribution curve
and everyone kind of freaked out and
they left their friends and they were
off Instagram and off Facebook and then
and now it's like the church has done a
better job at preparing Aries and um I
think you know maybe 5 years ago an 18
or 19 year-old leave home addicted to
their phone addicted to social media and
then that was taken away completely
whereas now phones are so normal that
that age of you know missionaries are
actually less addicted to their phone
than maybe even a millennial right like
because they're just they're so used to
it they're they're better able to manage
it I should say so when they step away
from it they're be better able to manage
their lives that's just I guess yeah

[07:00]
their lives that's just I guess yeah
yeah so you were what 18 to 20 when when
you did this 19 to 21 at the time and
today it's 18 to 21 gotcha and then I
wanted to talk about prior to that you
had a I wanted to get into kind of your
early hustles you had a guy named Danny
that you worked with I want to hear
about Danny and some of the lessons that
you learned from him yeah Danny was a
great guy he was the the father to my
wrestling partner Robert uh he was from
New Jersey he was just he was a hustler
just a New Jersey entrepreneur Hustler
had started and and owned restaurants
and pest control companies and you name
it he was just slick talker great at you
know taking something for a dollar and
selling it for two and I worked for him
and at the time it's just like Yep this
is my job I push a spreader all summer I
spray houses but then decades you know
years later a decade later I looked back
and I was like that's where I learned
business like that's like I was a first
in business for four years and that's

[08:02]
in business for four years and that's
why I am who I am because of that
experience with Danny and he had he had
like a unique uh billboard sign isn't
didn't he have like some kind of kind of
funky uh sign up that it was voted like
the worst whatever sign in the isore in
the town yeah I was in Titusville
Florida is where I grew up and he had a
company called Quantum pest control and
right there on us one
um next to the Indian River it was a big
billboard that had his logo Quantum and
then it was just a massive toothbrush
with a massive cockroach on top of it
bristles that said Got Bugs that's it no
number just the logo and the words got
bugs and that drove all of his business
and I just thought that was brilliant
yeah and someday you may do a pest
control company in the holding company
oh who knows I'm not I'm not against any
any company I love all business I wanted
to talk if I did I would I would use
that billboard for sure yeah yeah it was

[09:02]
that billboard for sure yeah yeah it was
cool it's if if people haven't seen it
on Twitter it's worth checking out um I
wanted to talk to about your writing and
this woman I think maybe in high school
that inspired you Jane spidel you're a
really great writer like your content I
I really appreciate it and appreciate
good writing and I wanted to hear about
Jane spidel and just how you got started
writing thank you I I appreciate that um
she was you know she was my yearbook
advisor and I joined yearbook just
because it was another class and she I I
tweeted about this but I I had an
assignment to write about uh a part of
the school that I had to go observe for
an hour and she was very dramatic she
she was just I don't know there's no
other word for her she was very dramatic
she was extra and um so I wrote this
very sarcastic essay about the the
beauty of the orchestra room and I just
made it I was just I was being sarcastic

[10:02]
made it I was just I was being sarcastic
and she took it seriously and she loved
it and it touched her and that made me
the assistant executive editor based on
that one essay um which meant that I
became the executive editor the the next
year my senior year so that's kind of
where you started to hone your craft of
of writing yeah and then you know I I
started starting businesses and my
writing kind of changed to be more
copywriting to convince people to buy
things and I just I never really took a
course or read a book I just kind of
learned from what I saw in ads that
seemed to work and copied and changed to
fit my own needs yeah so now you're
doing a newsletter you you post on
Twitter frequently I wanted to hear a
little bit about how Twitter has
affected your
career yeah so it's I feel like I'm
still in the very early days of Twitter
I've only been posting consistently
there um for like 15 months I had

[11:03]
there um for like 15 months I had
another stint on Twitter a few years ago
that was a completely different
experience so I have I have a a lot of
experience writing or posting stuff to
Twitter but only about 15 or 16 months
of doing long form kind of intentional
thoughtful content on Twitter on my
current account and the jury still out
on what how much of an effect it will
have on my businesses because I'm not
really actively promoting things
um but it's just brought some incredible
opportunities and people into my Orbit
that's that's hard to
quantify uh Nick Huber the sweaty
startup guy he talks about writing being
a superpower and I think there's a lot
of Truth to that like there's for some
reason people that can write we kind of
put them up on a pedestal and look at
them like this guy you know this guy and
yeah I I think I think it's a great
great skill to have and anybody ought to
develop it it's um

[12:00]
develop it it's um
yeah are you a big reader is that is
that I not as much lately I used to be
but I just haven't dedicated much time
to it over the last few years but I
think what is unique about my Twitter
content is a lot of times you have
people that can write really well but
they're not doing they're not actually
doing things in in Life or in business
that are worth writing about right right
they're they're good at putting words
together they know all the skills
they've taken a course they've read the
books but they're just writing about
kind of surface level fluff or
regurgitating stuff that they're reading
in those books um and then you have
people that are doing really cool things
in business or in entrepreneurship but
they're not really good at writing about
it or they don't care to write about it
they could be excellent writers but
they're just not on social media which
is great more power to them and I think
I'm different in that I'm I'm doing both
right I'm actually doing things I'm
starting companies I have real
experiences and I don't mind being
transparent about them because there's
no one to fire me um I I'm not
controversial so I there's no fear of

[13:01]
controversial so I there's no fear of
like getting cancelled so I'm just kind
of taking actually what I'm doing and
then taking some writing skills and
putting them yeah Nick had the same
point that you got to be doing
interesting things in order to post good
content and I wanted to get into the
companies that that you're running
you've got a holding company called
co-founders so tell me about that and
then just like some of the companies
that are within the holding company and
the one or two that you're like most
excited about right now yeah so so um
co-founders is comprised of company
called mining Syndicate which is where
I'm sitting today it is a company that
sells uh crypto mining Hardware um and
services like hosting and and software
as well so we're basically a data center
um for crypto miners um but we get most
of our revenue from selling the hardware
not the services and then I have a
company called Texas snacks and we
resell bues products bues being a 50
chain
kind of Mega Gas Station it's like the

[14:01]
kind of Mega Gas Station it's like the
Disney of gas
stations that's a whole you know story
in of itself and then I have a company
called Fast tree care which we started
last summer with an operator and that's
just a boring old tree trimming business
that's a lot of fun and we have a
company called voltera um which is a an
AI software that helps skilled nursing
facilities find more U medical codes to
bill for that's um pre-revenue we're
about to to go live with our first Camp
of customers and then we own an RV park
in Waco Texas uh just a simple RV park
small one and then we are constantly
incubating slash working on three to
five other projects some of them may
never launch some of them could be
really big businesses so let's go into
that a little bit I know you'll you'll
partner with mbas and business students
things like that talk to me about that
process if there's somebody listening
right now that is intrigued by what
you're up to and wants to get in
involved like how do you how do you vet

[15:00]
involved like how do you how do you vet
people how do you how do you split
Equity like how do how does the whole
thing work yeah so we our our job quote
our position um is posted on hundreds of
universities across the country and so
we look for students that are Entre
entrepreneurial we don't care uh where
they live we don't care what their GPA
is we don't care what their major is it
literally makes no difference we just
want someone that has made it
uh with entrepreneurship before maybe it
was a lemonade stand maybe it was a
massive company we don't even care we
just want them to have that Gene we we
can't make them an entrepreneur and we
don't want to try so they have to have
the gene furthermore that we want them
to have three qualities we want them to
be humble um just willing to learn a
sponge moldable uh we want them to be
grateful just grateful for the
opportunity we just there's a direct
correlation between kids that are really
really great to have been chosen and

[16:00]
really great to have been chosen and
their success right um and then the
third is energy we want them to have
high energy they could be introverted
that's fine I am as well um but we just
want them to be excited we want to hang
up with them and then just feel
energized from the conversation um so if
they meet those uh criteria then we give
them three business ideas to choose from
we give them a salary we give them a
timeline and we fund the idea itself and
we take majority equity in the business
maybe 51% maybe 70% and then we just
hold their hand and we tell them exactly
what to do and how to start it be
successful it sounds awesome it's such a
good idea and these are all college age
kids for the most part you're not hiring
people that are further along in their
career correct correct yeah yeah those
three qualities you listed Warren
Buffett's got a similar thing of like
what he looks for in managers and
leaders and it it's a very similar list

[17:00]
leaders and it it's a very similar list
I've I heard that just recently and I
think one or two of them there was some
overlap yeah I think integrity was one
Integrity energy are definitely two of
them I like the I like the humility and
the gratefulness that's uh just being
teachable being a learner yeah those are
huge um so let's go into you had
mentioned bies I'm from Columbus Ohio I
mentioned earlier I I really hadn't
heard of bies up until a few months ago
and I saw it on Twitter maybe through
you maybe maybe through Michael girdley
I'm not sure exactly but tell me about
Texas snacks bies and what you're doing
with with that portion of the company
yeah so bies is like I said it's a
massive gas station um they're 60,000
square feet they have over 100 pumps um
if you drive by one you you will have
remembered it they're they started in
Texas they opened their first one
outside of Texas and Alabama and now
they're in about a dozen states or so
but opening more every quarter or two um
and they're very unique they just have
an amazing brand it's this cartoonish

[18:00]
an amazing brand it's this cartoonish
beaver and I don't know what they did
but they tapped into something magical
to where if you go to a bues you have to
talk about it you have to fall in love
with it you and you just love it it's
just an amazing experience what is it
about it I mean I've never been to one
obviously so what is it about it what
have they done right that that Taps into
this customer love that gets created
well I think a lot of it is is
confirmation bias so they have a great
brand and so I think a lot of people
that go there have already heard about
it they've heard good things so they're
expecting a great experience and then
you know there's a 100 gas pumps and
it's just unusual so they're just they
walk in with this wide-eyed wonder and
then you walk in and it's just busy it's
just got good energy everyone's friendly
they're known for their bathrooms um
their bathrooms are spotless super nice
and then they they have a full
restaurant in there serving Texas
barbecue and they just have a whole wall
of jerky a whole wall of candy thousands
of snacks all like a lot of unique

[19:01]
of snacks all like a lot of unique
products or items that you couldn't find
anywhere else and it's just it's just a
great experience that's what it is it's
an experience it's not a gas station
it's closer to to Disney than a gas
station so your idea was to sell Buy's
products so talk to me about that
because they originally said no to you
right yeah well they originally ignored
me and so I I went to a bues and just
out of curiosity I pulled up their
website on my phone
and they didn't sell online and that
just that boggled my mind um I mean at
this time they probably had 30 locations
each location does guesstimated between
like 20 and 30 million a year so we're
talking you know half a billion dollar
company Plus at the time and they didn't
sell online and you go there for the
snacks but they also have all this merch
like dozens of different shirts and
really you know cute looking clothes
that particular women loved to wear and

[20:00]
that particular women loved to wear and
nothing was online and so at this time I
owned a a third party logistics company
that out that e-commerce Brands would
Outsource their fulfillment operations
to us and so I thought man buies could
be a great customer to us so let's try
to snag them so I started emailing the
executive team saying hey we have this
company called send eeds and we can
manage all of your ecomer will you know
white glove put up your we it we'll do
everything for you let us know no
response crickets and so I just thought
this needs to happen um I'm going to do
this myself I'll do it for them and so I
looked into it I was like all right am I
going to get sued here and there's this
law called first sale Doctrine which
states that anyone can sell whatever
they want they just can't pretend to be
another brand right so I can resell
Bucky stuff just like I can resell my
iPhone I just can't pretend to be apple
right and and so we launched a website

[21:02]
right and and so we launched a website
we called it Beaver snacks at the time
because that's their mascot as a beaver
and we put big disclaimer saying we're
not bies we're buying and then reselling
their products with the market so we we
lost I took my family to bies we bought
one of everything it was like two or
three thousand everyone was looking at
us sideways they didn't know what to
think of us because they had never seen
this before and brought a back to our
warehouse hired a photographer took
pictures of everything put it on a
website and then I started emailing
reporters and I just said hey this is
who I am this is what we're doing we're
launching a business we want to get
Bucky's attention so I didn't tell
reporters this but internally I'm
thinking worst case they say this is not
okay we're going to sue you and even if
they have no grounds to sue us we'll
just shut it down because I don't want
to mess with them yeah best case they
say hey we'll partner with you or best
case it's hey we will partner with you
but you know you now have a profitable

[22:02]
but you know you now have a profitable
company and so I emailed reporters and I
was on the phone with a lawyer by the
end of the day the Bucky's in-house
counsel and he said uh listen we don't
mind what you're doing um we have no
interest in selling online we don't mind
if you do but please make a few changes
we don't want you to use the word Beaver
because it's confusing change the name
more disclaimers make the disclaimer
easier to read and you have our blessing
so that was why do you think they had no
interest in doing it themselves seems
like it's a I don't know what the
revenue would have been but it's got to
be decent chunk of change you're giving
up yeah I think that they're trying to
optimize for the inore experience and I
I don't know this they haven't told me
this but my hunch is that they think it
would cannibalize their inor sales or
incentivize people to not come to the
store um and I think they want the the
Buy experience to stay exclusive and

[23:00]
Buy experience to stay exclusive and
Elusive and unique whereas if you can
just click and order it then it's it's
even if their sales go up and even if it
doesn't hurt their inore sales it's just
not as much of a novelty any so you're
going directly to the stores each week
or a couple times a week to buy
merchandise to then sell online is that
how the logistics of it work yeah so we
we have pretty close relationships with
the general manager of two different
stores and then decent relationships
with two other stores as well and so we
will place an order beforehand um and
they will receive it from their
Distribution Center palletize our order
let us know when it's ready and then we
will show up we'll make sure
everything's in there and then we'll go
to the front counter with everyone else
they will um kind of portion off our
line our aisle and we'll swipe that card
for tens of thousands of dollars and
then load it up in our box truck and
drive it to the

[24:00]
drive it to the
warehouse that's
incredible every week and this all
developed because you already were doing
it's called 3pl right third party
Logistics you were already doing this
for other food companies right like ice
cream and Candy whatever you know like
you were already doing that right yeah I
mean we didn't need that we could have
done it from our house if we wanted it
just made it a lot more convenient we
already had software we had the skills I
have an e-commerce background so it made
it a lot easier
um but funny enough like after two years
of doing both the Texas snacks company
that we owned and the e-commerce
fulfillment for other brands we just
looked at our financials every month and
said man this 3pl stuff does not make
any money like we just this is such a
hard business it's the high high margin
for error let's just fire our customers
and only do the Bucky stuff and so we
did so so the company the holding
company
co-founders are you do you have Partners

[25:01]
co-founders are you do you have Partners
I know you're partnering with the
college kids that we mentioned but do
you also have a partner that you you
know it's like you're Charlie Munger
your right-hand man that is bouncing off
these ideas and figuring out what to
pursue yeah his name is Nick keski and
he was one of my mission companions in
Hungary oh that's awesome actually he
was my first so they call that your
trainer so he helped me learn Hungarian
and we've been best friends for like 18
years now ever since
you talked about a little bit about like
the entrepreneurial Gene do you do you
think that's something that's like
innate in people or do you think it can
develop I think it could be either or
for me it was developed um it doesn't
run in my family at all uh I just I grew
up poor and I I I lived across the
street from a golf course and my first
business was selling golf balls um they
would that would land in my yard and in
the ditch across the street and I would
go him up and put him in a Red Rider

[26:00]
go him up and put him in a Red Rider
wagon and wash them and and walk them to
the clubhouse and sell them in the
parking lot until the the owner would
yell at me that's awesome that that was
out of necessity because there was no
money for a yearbook or for candy or for
a
bike you had to earn it if you wanted it
right I had to earn it yeah do you do
that with your own kids I'm curious I've
got absolutely you do yeah if they if
they want something you put it theonis
on them to no so they do they all have
like a chore chart and they earn money
they can buy whatever they want with
that um but it's it's not like super
hardcore you know we also buy them
things but yeah what I was saying yes to
is that all four of our kids are very
entrepreneurial my wife is
entrepreneurial as well it's just it is
in our DNA as a family um so for them
it's nature and nurture it was just
nurture yeah and so are they working in
some of the companies that you've got
going do you put them to to work like
doing fulfillment from time to time um

[27:02]
doing fulfillment from time to time um
they'll do fulfillment for Texas snacks
not super often um but really it's more
of they they sell stuff at school and we
help them with that my daughter will
make bracelets my kids well we'll go to
uh wco which is like a budget grocery
store where you can buy candy by the
pound and um I'll give them like a $5
budget and we'll do compet Ians so they
can see who can turn that $5 into the
most amount of money at school by
reselling the camp I think I heard you
you said you do something similar with
like a Robin Hood account right like
they trade and and you have a
competition to see who can who can trade
we we did that once with crypto actually
just for fun and it was it was bad
timing none of them did well it was when
things were collapsing yeah
yeah but let's get into that I wanted to
hear about you've got some great stories

[28:01]
hear about you've got some great stories
about John maffy of maffy security
Fame very fascinating guy I think
they're I think you had mentioned
they're making a movie about his life
tell me about how you got connected with
him and just like that entire that
entire story yeah that's that is that's
a long story so I'll give you the
highlights and that is 2017 crypto was
just booming Bitcoin was going from
3,000 to 20,000 over the course of two
months and I was deeply entrenched in
all of that at the time I I first bought
Bitcoin in 2016 and i' just been curious
with it and so I had a thesis in
2017 that crypto altcoin specifically so
everything aside from Bitcoin and
ethereum I had a I had a thesis that
these prices were driven by hyp and I
wasn't a genius a lot of people thought
that but my thesis was that this would
be measurable right and so I kind of

[29:00]
be measurable right and so I kind of
developed an algorithm that took the
hype of an altcoin which was derived
from how many social media mentions and
you know mentions on Twitter and on
Reddit and all those platforms I would
make a hype score and I would divide it
against the market cap so if a token had
a really high market cap but no one was
talking about it then my algorithm would
say short and if you know it had a very
low market cap whatever I was talking
about it would say bye and I put this
together and then I started tracking it
and it worked and I thought wow this is
this could be huge this is this is
really big I found Alpha and you know to
find Alpha in the stock market is
impossible hard to do crypto in crypto
why not right so I was a nobody on
social media I had no following and and
this was 2017 correct 17 yep late 2017
good timing and so yep and so well in a
sense bad timing in another other sense
because that it was all about to crash

[30:00]
because that it was all about to crash
but right I I thought okay I need to
reach out to John McAfee because he was
the biggest influencer on in crypto
Twitter at the time get about 800,000
followers and so he's notoriously
unreachable I I tried to guess his email
uh to no success until finally I did I
Ed an app to see if if he would open my
emails and he finally opened it but he
wouldn't respond so I just kept emailing
email emailing emailing saying John I've
got something big I want to show you he
finally responded and he was very uh
critical very you know standoffish said
I don't believe you and I said let me
show you in person I thought if I could
if I could present in person then he'll
he'll buy into it so he finally said yes
he said come to my house in
Tennesse and so I flew to Alabama um I
stayed at a friend's house in Northern
Alabama and then I drove up to his house
and he had said I'll send you my address
the morning up so I started driving to
his city which is Lexington 10 and he
wouldn't respond to my email I didn't

[31:00]
wouldn't respond to my email I didn't
have his address until like the last
minute he gave me his address so I
showed up and he wanted me to show up at
1:23 p.m. and this was late February
2018 at this point um and I presented
this to him and it was a wild it was
wild he had a whole camera curve from
Australia there he had bodyguards he had
assault rifle rifles laying on the
ground um it was everything everything
you'd imagine and I presented this to
him and he loved it he understood it
immediately and he said uh what do you
what do you need from me and we launched
a company together it's
crazy and how did it unfold from there
yeah so I asked him to tweet about me
twice per week and I would give him a
quarter of the profits and the whole
play was to start a free community for
people that wanted access to these
altcoin picks and then to you know once
started relying on it and investing in
it and liking it to start charging for

[32:02]
it and liking it to start charging for
full access to all of the PS and so we
did we launched a Discord Community it
had tens of thousands of members he
would tweet about me twice per week he
did everything he said he would do um we
ended up launching a token and it grew
to a 30 something million dollar market
cap we were listed on a dozen major
exchanges um and then the market just
started crashing I mean it was crashing
the whole time but you couldn't tell we
thought it was just dipping temporarily
um turned out to be a 2-year bare market
and we just fought that the whole time
and so their market cap dropped drop
drop drop drop people would leave the
community and it ended up just kind of
dying a slow
death it's such a good story actually I
I remember that time 2017 he could move
a market with a single
tweet yeah he could
and uh we were yeah go ahead we were

[33:01]
and uh we were yeah go ahead we were
always very careful about that we didn't
have an Ico we didn't want to sell any
tokens we didn't want him to really move
the market um and he ended up getting in
trouble for a lot of those tweets yeah I
mean he ended up going to prison right I
mean since passed away but I think
didn't he get put in prison for tax tax
evasion for tax fraud yeah yeah did you
have any trepidation going into business
with them were you like this guy I did I
did I mean I had trepidation about going
into his house you seem like the
antithesis of him like you're this
Mormon guy right he is the exact
opposite drinking and party you know
like just seems like a wild lifestyle
that he's LED it just seems like there
couldn't be two different partners we
were very different yeah and it I wanted
to keep it more of a like a business
owner influencer relationship as opposed
to business partner relationship and so
I call him a partner in the sense that
there would not have been business
without him he wasn't one of many
influencers that we used as part of a

[34:01]
influencers that we used as part of a
strategy he was the only distribution
channel that we had right right so in
that sense he was a partner in a literal
sense he was not he didn't own any
Equity um he never invested I never gave
him money it was just kind of a REV
share agreement but yeah I I did have
trepidation which is why I structured it
like that so I trepidation walking into
his house I bet with the bodyguards and
the assault rifles or whatever it was
nervous it had been quite quite an
experience to just just be part of that
whole scene yes it was so so you've
since started a Bitcoin mining company
like how did that come about like have
you did you toss aside like all the
altcoin stuff and like you're focused
strictly on Bitcoin now because I know
you're like a big Bitcoin
guy yeah so uh the crypto company died
in
2019 and then in 2021
Bitcoin was booming again it was the
next cycle right and China had banned

[35:03]
next cycle right and China had banned
mining in the summer of 2021 overnight
and so the difficulty rate plummeted
which meant mining became extremely
profitable like very very profitable and
so all of us enterprising Americans such
as myself latched on to that and we
started looking for ways to mine
Bitcoin and so I started looking for
facilities for places to lease that had
heavy power on site and I was striking
out until I finally found a place 30
minutes from home um for sale and I
reached out to the seller directly and I
bought the facility from him when I say
I bought the facility it wasn't a
business there was no LLC there were no
employees it was just a lease um in a
rented building that I'm sitting in
right now um that already had all of the
infrastructure and Transformers on site
to enable hundreds of Bitcoin miners in
immediately which was very very hard to
find especially at the time did you have

[36:01]
find especially at the time did you have
any miners at at all at that point the
facility did come with miners so what I
bought came with miners that were mining
Bitcoin directly but we took that asset
and we turned it into a company which is
today mining Syndicate um so we
basically spent a lot of money for
access to a lease and infrastructure and
a handful of miners that were netting
like 15 grand a month at the time we
knew that was very shortlived because
they were late model miners um and we we
sold the miners because we didn't want
to be in the mining business we wanted
to be in the hardware and in a hosting
business so say more about that so how
you're not
selling you aren't tell me more don't
mind Bitcoin you don't mind Bitcoin you
are
selling you're like a server basically
picks and shovels yeah okay we we sell
so if you let's say you wanted to mine
Bitcoin yeah we would sell you $5,000
machine um which would mine you

[37:02]
machine um which would mine you
like call it $12 a day in profit of
Bitcoin and then we would sell you the
electricity and the services which would
be about 200 bucks a month as well um so
we make most of our money selling that
machine and then we kind of break even
on the hosting um so that's that's our
business so had you done any of your
like mining on your own prior to this
like did you have any experience at all
doing your I mining of Bitcoin I had
almost no experience which never uh you
know detracts me for better or worse I
had bought two miners from eBay
throughout this whole process to learn I
plugged them in I was like okay I'm an
expert right but no I I didn't have much
experience at
all so what's on the horizon for for the
I mean let's talk a little bit more
about Bitcoin I mean is it it's
something you have strong conviction in

[38:01]
something you have strong conviction in
you make any price predictions in the
for this coming cycle that we're
in um yeah I can make predictions but
I've never been good at them um I to me
Bitcoin is just math which is why I like
it yeah it's provable SC it's provable
scarcity which not even gold has uh we
think gold is scarce but we don't know
how how scarce it is right right so I
think Bitcoin is a gold replacement
maybe not a gold killer but just a a
Superior alternative to Gold that will
eventually overtake Gold's market cap
which would mean that bit one Bitcoin
would be like three or $400,000 each I
think it's a statistical inevitability
that Bitcoin will hit a 100 Grand and
then a million dollars each is it going
to be in months or years or decades I
don't know um I do think we'll hit 100
Grand this cycle over the next 18 months
yeah and maybe even 150 or two right and
so you you do not trade in and out of
position positions with Bitcoin like you
you buy you hold and

[39:01]
you buy you hold and
you huddle as they say right I'm yes I'm
so bad at at like investing in stocks
that but what I am good at though is I'm
good at never selling and it it took it
did took years it did take years to
learn that so if I if I buy a stock I
will never sell that stock if I buy
Bitcoin or ethereum I will never sell it
because the pain that I feel from
selling too early is much greater than
the pain I feel from losing money
right right wasn't one of your first
Investments Circuit City yep that was my
first investment it was your first and
that was a pretty big loss wasn't it uh
at the time it was a third of my net
worth which was a whopping $500 right so
I was 21 um yeah but I I have I've
foregone a lot more money selling things
too early like when MH the last time I
did that and the last time I will ever
do that was in March of 2020 when I

[40:02]
do that was in March of 2020 when I
freaked out and I sold all my stocks
nope I don't like where this is going
and you name it like Nvidia Tesla
Shopify like need I say more
yeah I like my Tesla has already tripled
I'm gonna sell it now yeah I had 8X more
to go after that right yeah it's painful
my brother did the same thing he
panicked and yeah huge upside that you
end up missing out on
yeah I just I don't do that anymore like
I've held Bitcoin yeah at 85% drops like
I yeah I don't sell
yeah how do you deal with the volatility
like you know the drop from let's say 60
whatever it was 67,000 down to 15 or
16,000 how how do you think about that
psychologically how does it affect you I
I use friction wherever I can in life um
so there's a lot of friction between me
and being able to sell Bitcoin yeah
passwords two- Factor
authentication um multi setup or

[41:01]
authentication um multi setup or
something all of it yeah and I just
don't
like honestly
I when I sold Bitcoin too early when I
sold those stocks that was when I was
more of a Speculator and not a Believer
and I think Bitcoin is going to be here
forever yeah right and so I just I would
sell it to pay the mortgage or to feed
my family like I'm not stupid um but I
don't sell it even if it's dropping 80%
I just can't I'm not good at timing it
and I don't want to get good at timing
it so I don't think about it so I don't
sell it yeah yeah I think that's smart I
want to get into real estate a little
bit talk to me about like some of your
fir like your first real estate deal how
did you first get turned onto real
estate because I know that's one of your
passions
too I first uh got into real estate in
2008 great timing yeah I uh
I at the time Obama in instituted the
first time home buyer tax credit you
remember that I do and it was

[42:02]
remember that I do and it was
$8,000 um and he changed it eventually
to be like um what was it like a tax
deduction but in the beginning it was a
check to your bank right and as a 21y
old with $500 to my name um that was
very attractive and so I got home from
my mission at 21 and I just felt like I
could take on the world I had all the
confidence in the world and so I started
reading all the business books and all
the real estate books and I I started
college and I wanted to be a homeowner
and I I didn't have any money so my wife
and I started waiting tables we were in
Tuscaloosa Alabama and um we seven
months into marriage we bought a
three-bedroom one bath house Tusc Lusa
for
$90,000 and it had been sitting on the
market forever and we didn't know what
we were doing we used the same broker
that was listing it you know to buy it
she said oh the sellers the sellers
won't budge on price so don't even ask

[43:01]
won't budge on price so don't even ask
like oh okay whatever you say uh and
like it had been sitting for a year at
the same price and they they definitely
would have come down on price I didn't
know what I was doing anyway we bought
the house we moved into it we got $8,000
from Obama we took that and we bought a
rental house five minutes away um and
those were our first two homes and that
has since led to mobile home parks right
so that led to a third rental house and
then I'm moved to Dallas Texas and I
partner with a couple guys we bought a
small RV Park in Oklahoma and then we
bought 24 more mobile home Andor RV
parks over the next two years we sold
the portfolio in
2021 and then I started buying them with
Nick my partner at co-founders uh last
year and then I'm also a GP uh on some
deals occasionally with other partners
as well so what is it about mobile home
parks that you like you've done are you
doing value ads when you buy

[44:00]
doing value ads when you buy
them I love it because it is you're
really buying land and you're
maintaining the infrastructure under the
land um and not the houses itself which
most people don't realize that they
think ah mobile home park it's gonna
have all these maintenance issues yes if
you own the mobile homes but that's not
what we do so we will buy a park and
sometimes the tenants own the homes
sometimes the park owns the homes
regardless after closing on the park we
will give or sell the homes back to the
tenants if they want them if they don't
want them then we will give them plenty
of time to move and then we you know we
take a hit on the Topline Revenue but we
don't really have to manage anything
after that we just own the land and rent
it
out so is this something you're looking
to add more mobile homes to your to your
portfolio or you kind of tapped out
right
now um it's kind of a passive thing so
people will DM me deals and if they're
attractive then sometimes I'll just
assign them to someone else um or

[45:02]
assign them to someone else um or
occasionally we'll buy one ourselves but
it's not something I'm look really
looking to scale but I'm also not
avoiding it right now so I want to hear
about like an average day for you you're
creating a bunch of content you're
writing 30 or 40,000 words a week I
believe um you've got all you know the
holding company co-founders all these
businesses underneath it how are you
running like an average day for you
while still maintaining a family a wife
all of that yeah so an average day for
me is I wake up at like 6 or so and I
just shower and go straight to the
office one of two offices and I just
start working um I drink caffeine and I
just put on my airpods put on something
in the background and I will just I'll
get the inbox zero right away I will
just knock out a to-do list I will write
a long form tweet and I will just kind
of I'll kind of hop from helping my
operators hop on calls with them

[46:00]
operators hop on calls with them
impromptu and I will write content I'll
write my newsletter and I I leave my
calendar pretty much empty most of the
time I just don't like structured
meetings and I'll just kind of I'll
tackle fires one at a time yeah and I'll
do that until about 6 pm and then I'll
come home and I'll eat dinner with my
family every night like there's never
really a reason to miss dinner I don't
travel that much
and then I'll take the boys to
basketball practice I'll usually work in
the car while they're practicing um and
then I come home hang out with the kids
put them in bed and then I'll watch
something with my wife and sometimes
I'll have the the computer open as I I
watch Love is Blind tell me about
Parkinson's law what is Parkinson's law
and and how does it affect your life
Parkinson's law states that um work
expands to fill the time allotted to it
so you know back to high school if you
had a big huge project due three months

[47:01]
had a big huge project due three months
from now you're probably going to get it
done the night before and it's probably
going to be great at least that's how I
worked right um whereas if you if you
only have an hour to do something then
you you'll get it done in that hour and
so the same principle is true with Elon
buying Twitter and firing 80% of people
and it just keeps going uh and then the
same principle is true with just taking
on way too many projects and too many
people or too many companies so
I just kind of let the most important
things bubble their way to the surface
and if I let something slip if I you
know forget to do something then that's
just a message to me that it wasn't that
important um I'm not going to forget my
family right like that's that's not in
my work bucket right so that's the most
important and then if there's a big fire
like an investor we're raising money or
like that just lives in the top of my
head and it will get done and everything
else like whatever my time kind of I
gravitate towards is what's most
important because it's what I'm placing

[48:00]
important because it's what I'm placing
importance in and everything else just
falls to the Wayside and maybe I pick it
back up in a month when it's more
important then or maybe I never pick it
back up but I used to fight that right
and just really try to hone in on one
thing this works really well for me and
it's what I love doing and honestly it
doesn't feel like work like 12-hour days
every day it's it's no different than a
N9 to-5 guy working six hours at the
office and then fishing six hours if
that's what he loves like it all feels
like play to me yeah so yeah stepen cvy
is a Mormon and he's got the Franklin
planner that I used to really be into my
wife actually still into the Franklin
planner she carries it around it's like
a big massive bigger than a telephone
old telephone book and she lives her
entire life by that do you is that
something you utilize to like kind of
structure things and keep track of
things and priori
guys no so I I have a very low Tech

[49:01]
guys no so I I have a very low Tech
system I I have Chrome tabs open and if
it's a if it's an open tab then it's a
to-do list I have a few Google Sheets
that I leave pinned in Chrome at all
times that I'm always referring to I've
got my reminders app on my iPhone and
then I have unread emails and unread
texts and that's everything that I need
to do um I have a calendar right for
like stuff like this podcast most days
there's one or two things in my
calendar yeah it's it it it's something
that I've kind of fought fought fought
fought for years and uh but now I've
just stuck with it because it works I
want to get into idea generation you've
got a ton of ideas that you come up with
whether it's businesses or tweets that
you're you know threads that you're
writing talk to me about that creative
process where where do you come up with
ideas or where do you where's like the
fertilizer the source of of some of
these ideas come

[50:00]
these ideas come
from I don't know it's like I I consider
like the 10,000 hour rule right like
when when my work is my hobby and it's
all that I do outside of my family then
I just see things everywhere and I I
thought of this analogy a little while
ago I like I'm not a musician at all I
would like to be I I love music I played
the guitar a little bit but it is my
bucket list item to like have a hit song
like I I think that would be awesome but
I like the thought of writing a song is
just so forign to me right whereas some
people are like I don't have ideas like
how do you think of these ideas and so I
think of Taylor Swift and she has
hundreds of songs maybe thousands that
we don't even know about and they just
flow she'll just see something outside
and write a song and it's just because
that's all she is that's all she knows
that's all she sees and thinks about her
brain is wired in that way and it's
trained Tred to be wired in that way and
that's just how I am like I just I don't

[51:01]
that's just how I am like I just I don't
know I don't try to think of ideas I
don't have like a process I just see
things out there and I think I just
attach like Commerce to it or business
to it like oh this could be improved by
oh you could monetize it like that like
that's just how my brain works I I find
it fascinating is that why you've
partnered with some of these like
college and MBA students because you've
got so many ideas that you want to
pursue and you you them free reign and
let them run with it yeah exactly I like
the fast Tree Care I bought fasttree
care.com the domain like six years ago
and I just kept renewing it I was like
that is a good domain how is that not
taken and I had helped a friend as a
favor start his tree business and it
went amazingly and so I thought all
right that's just idea numbered 72 and
one day the Stars will align or not and
if they do then I'll launch this
business and it did and it's a great
business and it's a great domain game
and it's it's awesome and so co-founders

[52:01]
and it's it's awesome and so co-founders
is a vehicle for me to plant those ideas
with other people and because you know I
people tell me a lot what if you just
did one thing it's like well I do do one
thing and it's start businesses you know
I don't do one business because like I
wouldn't enjoy that yeah you know do you
find Andrew Wilkinson of
tiny he I think he made the comment that
it's like the paros law 8020 rule that
80% or what 20% of your companies are
generating 80% of the revenue do you
find that to be the case absolutely yeah
so is that Bitcoin mining is that Texas
snacks like right now it's Bitcoin
mining um just because it's it's the
most established and we're selling a
high ticket item so to have a $100,000
Day means we just have to sell 20 items
um right that kind of makes it easier to
be a bigger business business um but
co-founders is very new like our our AI

[53:01]
co-founders is very new like our our AI
startup is four months old our RV park
is eight months old um Texas snacks is
old um but that's just kind of that's
like a three or $4 million do business
and then mining Syndicate and then um
I'm probably forgetting about one or two
but yeah so I I don't know what that
8020 will look like right um in the
future
but yeah I want to kind of shift gears a
little bit you used to be a pretty heavy
dude two
280 2 260 you said you're not that
anymore so talk to me about that process
of of getting into ultramarathons and
losing a bunch of weight and and just
the training that was involved in that
like you had a comment with Chris Powers
who was like something about the
importance of seeking out and finding
hard things to do which I I'm totally
with totally in agreement with like make
yourself suffer even though like it goes

[54:02]
yourself suffer even though like it goes
against our grain tell me about the
ultra marathon stuff yeah so I I
celebrated my 10y year anniversary in
2008 with my wife and I was this size
when I got married I was this exact size
all throughout High School um throughout
my mission and then I I got home and I I
got married and I just let myself go and
I gained 50 60 pounds and my wife bless
her heart never once said a word she's
not the type she never said hey you
watch what you're eating like what are
you doing like man maybe you should work
out never ever ever once really she just
loved me yeah never and um and she never
gained a pound she had four kids W um
and like she always just lost it and
then had another kid and so she she's
the same size today that she was in high
school and so despite her never saying
anything we were on our 10 year
anniversary and I just looked in the
mirror and I was like what are you doing
like what who are you like what nothing

[55:00]
like what who are you like what nothing
like there wasn't a person that made a
comment I don't know what the trigger
was it was just I hit a point and I was
like this is this is unsustainable and I
had you know I had tried over the years
half-heartedly lost 20 pounds gained it
lost 30 lost 10 and I was like no I'm
done and I had heard about keto but I
didn't know anything about it and I was
like H let's try that all right when I
come home from Hawaii our anniversary
it's like I'm gonna start keto so I did
and um I just didn't look back I just
went strict keto I lost all the weight
and I didn't really do much exercise it
was just diet I played racket ball kind
of uh just a little bit on the weekends
but after I lost the way I hit my goal
weight and I was like okay now you got
to keep this off I didn't want to be on
keto forever so I like H I'll just start
running so I just went outside and I
don't have a background in running I
wrestle in high school and that's it so
I just started running around the
neighbor it um and I'd always told
myself I never ran a race I'm kind of

[56:02]
myself I never ran a race I'm kind of
like the All or Nothing type and so I
thought man it'd be a cool story if my
first race was a marathon it' just be
cool to not work up to it that that's my
that's the extent of my thinking right
right and so I just Googled a marathon
training plan uh how Higden I followed
it to a T I ran a marathon two and a
half months later and then I learned
what ultramarathons were I didn't even
know they existed and I ran an ultra
marathon a month after that and then I
ran 13 more over the next two years so
an Ultram marathon is what's the
shortest mileage 50k which is 31 miles
and what's the longest you what was the
longest one you did 139 139 so something
like that takes how
long 35 hours that one did straight
smokes yeah that's crazy yeah it is it's
it's pretty crazy and are you Ian tell I

[57:01]
it's pretty crazy and are you Ian tell I
mean that's wild I I biked Across
America that was like my big Journey
like app yeah that's pretty wild no I
appreciate these kind of stories and I
think they're great to seek out but I
can't imagine running whatever 36 hours
30 however long you know like that blows
my mind
honestly yeah I mean at the end of the
day it comes down to dialing in your
nutrition and I mean that while you're
running right like you you got to learn
like how many calories you need per hour
to keep going just like how many
calories your car needs or how many how
much gas your car needs every 100 miles
right and then you got to dial in your
you gotta take electrolytes that's the
big secret you just got to have your
salt potassium magnesium and then the
third is you just can't quit like you
just walk that's not an option you no
it's just not and you you walk a lot so
you say running but there's in a lot of

[58:00]
you say running but there's in a lot of
Ultras there's more walking than running
are you sleeping like taking a little
cat nap along the way
or people do yeah no I I never have um
people do it's commment on like
especially multi like 100 two 300 mile
races I've never
have is it something you would do that
level of distance again or is it like a
one and done like I did it I proved I
could do it I don't need to do it again
I would um I I definitely would I I
never quit one which I've since learned
is rare um it's it's they have like a 30
to 40% dropout rate which makes sense
but right I just on the 140 wi one I
remember being out there and like it was
the hardest thing I've ever done in my
life by far and I wanted to quit I just
thought I have four kids and they're
gonna ask me why I quit and I can't tell
them well Daddy broke his leg or you
know Daddy got bit by a snake I just

[59:00]
know Daddy got bit by a snake I just
have to tell them it was too hard mhm
and that was the only reason I just
couldn't do it I couldn't
quit and they they they would have been
like yeah of course it's hard but like I
just I couldn't stomach them remembering
that even if they never did like I just
couldn't do it no it's a great example
to set for them I want to get more into
your kids you've got a daughter that had
a lung
transplant and this story is really
amazing so tell me a little bit about
her the condition she had and then what
led to the lug transplant and then we'll
kind of go from there yeah she had um a
disease called pulmonary hypertension
which means high blood pressure in the
lungs extremely rare especially if they
don't if it's idiopathic which means the
doctors don't know the cause for it yep
sometimes older smokers will get it um
but it's very very rare to be born with
it one in a million and so we didn't
even know she had it until she was three
she kept getting um she just kept having

[1:00:02]
she kept getting um she just kept having
breathing issues she was misdiagnosed
with asthma then finally our
pediatrician it was just like maybe it's
pulmonary hypertension and like that
just set off this chain of events um and
so she was she was diagnosed with we we'
never heard of it and we learned it was
terminal um there's uh medication you
can take so basically what it means is
the artery Reon her lungs are too narrow
period She was born that way and so the
heart works on overdrive 247 to push it
through so her resting heart rate was in
the 120s to 150s oh W 247 and so
couldn't climb upstairs her lips
everyone thought she wore purple
lipstick because her lips are always
blue um and so from three to nine it
just got worse and she'd be on oxygen
sometimes or sometimes she had we were
in a trial in Denver like we Tri
everything but we you know there's no
cure and so at age n she the doctor's

[1:01:02]
cure and so at age n she the doctor's
like listen she needs a double lung
transplant that's the only way out of
this and it's not really out of it
because lungs don't last forever right
but it's it was just the best option and
so we had to move to Houston to be close
to the Texas Children's um which is the
best the best Long Hospital in the
country and she was was on the waiting
list for 6 weeks and we had a call late
at night and we took her in and she got
a lung transplant and it's been two
years almost to the day and she's been
healthy ever since that's
incredible super incredible and so what
what is the like is she will she have to
have you said there's a time limit on
lung transplants will she have to have
another one in her 20s or something like
that so the first year is the riskiest
and we got out of that and so average
lifespan of lungs is like seven to 10

[1:02:01]
lifespan of lungs is like seven to 10
years yeah um and so doctors will do a
second transplant um if all of the stars
align
if if they say it's okay and you know it
happens in in a minority of cases so
that's kind of the hope is a double like
a second L lung transplant some point in
the future yeah yeah my wife's father
had a
um idiopathic is the the term right
idiopathic lung issue and also had a had
a lung transplant and same thing you
know gave him five to 10 years and I
think you know he was older when he had
the transplant he was in
his late 60s I think when the transplant
happened but um okay was able to get a
lot more years than he probably
otherwise would have yeah so that's
interesting very very rare right I so
you since have become a don't owner so
talk to me about you and your wife and
what you guys have done you know trying
to give back the to to I guess thank the

[1:03:02]
to give back the to to I guess thank the
little boy that saved your daughter's
life yeah so a month or two after she
got her transplant I learned about
living organ donation which basically
means donating your a a portion of your
liver because livers actually regenerate
you only have one but it will regenerate
so donating a portion of your liver or
donating one of your two kidneys or
donating blood marrow MH and so I
learned about I didn't even know it was
a thing I just thought you'd be you know
an organ donor on your trav's license
and I had learned about doing it
altruistically which or also known as
non-directed where you just give it to a
stranger yeah and it only happens a
couple hundred times a
year Nationwide that people choose to do
this you're saying yeah there's about
4,000 kidney donations a year and about
95% of them are two a loved one okay the
rest are non-direct so I had just felt
immense gratitude to Sam the boy who

[1:04:01]
immense gratitude to Sam the boy who
tragically died and gave my daughter his
lungs and I wanted to pay it for it and
it it seemed like a very logical way to
do it once I learned
about how low risk of a procedure it is
yeah you told me it's like a colonoscopy
or giving birth or something like about
the same OD about three and 10,000 um
mortality rate right and what was the
stat I read that if just one in
10,000 people did this kind of kidney
donation there would be tell me about
that I I don't know the exact numbers
yeah so I kind of had to backend into
this math myself once I learned it I
just like wow I kind of like the makave
story I just wanted to shout it from the
rooftops that's if one in every 10,000
healthy American adults um so not just
Americans not just adult
like healthy American adults were to
donate their kidney then no one would

[1:05:01]
donate their kidney then no one would
die waiting for a kidney whereas today
about 5,000 people a year die on the
transplant list wow yeah and your wife
also did the same procedure you and your
wife both gave a kidney and went through
this process yep just two weeks ago two
weeks ago she did hers
wow that's incredible so to find out
more about it tell I think you mentioned
a organization or a website what what
was that yeah the National Kidney
registry okay I think it's like
nkr something like that yeah kidney
registry.org I'll put links in the show
notes to this I I'm interested in it I
you know I don't know that I would I
really admire people that do something
like this so pretty cool stuff um before
we wrap up is there anything that we
didn't touch on that you wanted to talk
about no I don't think so we had talked
about this earlier where I'm doing this
um a live call-in show I I kind of call
it the the Dave Ramsey for entrepreneurs

[1:06:02]
it the the Dave Ramsey for entrepreneurs
where I love it yeah people can call in
