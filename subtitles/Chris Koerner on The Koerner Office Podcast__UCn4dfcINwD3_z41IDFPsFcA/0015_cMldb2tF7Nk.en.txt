are first a business owner that has a
virtual receptionist business and he
wants to know how to acquire customers
and how to hone in on a home service
Niche the second one we're talking about
is a com is a guy that has a small SAS
business that uses Google Earth and
Google imagery and Google Street View to
and AI to find leads for Home Service
professionals such as if a tree is
hanging low over a roof he can identify
that and send the homeowner a mailer or
a roof with a tarp on it he can send
that lead to a roofing company and sell
it to them super cool software it only
exists on an Enterprise grade right now
that at least his competitors are only
Enterprise scale so I think this company
has a bright future and I told him that
I would be one of his first customers
and I would pay him a lot of money to
bring me uh tree leads that was the
second caller and then another caller
came in and chimed in with an idea so
that's still the second idea and then
the third one is a guy that wants to buy

[01:01]
the third one is a guy that wants to buy
a custom souvenir business of all things
and he wants to start one and I gave him
some pretty pointed advice on whether he
should buy or start one and I think you
guys will really like that one the one
after that is a guy in Missouri that
wants to start his trash business so I
helped him walk through some customer
acquisition ideas that might be a little
unique and then the last but not least
is a guy up in New Jersey that wants to
buy an assai Bowl franchise and put it
in a mall and supposedly it's a great
franchise it's doing really well but I
gave him some advice and so it's going
to be shorter today because we cut out
seven of 12 but if you want to see the
other seven the other seven are a
woodworker on YouTube a home appraisal
guy a board games company a guy that
wants to start a Nigerian restaurant SAS
product a real estate agent website guy
and a dance studio guy so those will be
on our website but for now enjoy episode
4 and please please please I'm begging
you I'm begging you if you're on YouTube
leave a comment let me know what you
think I don't know if this is good I

[02:00]
think I don't know if this is good I
really don't I don't know or if you're
on Spotify or apple you can actually on
Spotify you can leave a comment on each
episode to tell me what you think so I
would love to subscribe but really I
just want to know if this is any good or
not so thank you for listening and or
watching and or calling in live I
appreciate you guys and let's get to the
[Music]
show hey my name is Corey and and so I
recently started up a virtual Reception
Company and Ruby I'm sorry like Ruby
yeah
exactly and we're specifically going
after the home service
industry here and I'm curious to get
your opinion on maybe some
different sales channels to explore
because I've been most ly focused on

[03:01]
because I've been most ly focused on
cold calling however some of the people
that don't answer are going to be the
ones that I probably want to Target the
most so I would need to develop
different sequences there in order to to
best Target them and ensure that I can
actually reach them but that's been
going pretty well so far 40% of owners
have answered their business phone and
most have expressed at least some kind
of interest but then again 40% haven't
answered their phone at all so I'm just
curious what you think about some
different channels to explore because I
do like that more personal touch that
comes with the phone call as opposed to
emailing or other avenues don't have the
the budget necessarily to spend on
Google ads like search query ads or that
kind of deal okay I think I have
everything I need I'm going to go ahead
and disc conect you and I'm excited to

[04:00]
and disc conect you and I'm excited to
answer all right his name Andy yeah Andy
has a soft a virtual reception service
right like Ruby so Ruby started out as
Ruby receptionist. comom now they're
just ruby.com I believe and they're
massive they're massive company so in
general I like the idea of watching
these companies usually takes about a
decade that just start at obscure you
start hearing about them and then
they're everywhere I I think of upwork
right upwork Ruby whatever and then you
take what they do and then you unbundle
it as then you offer that exact same
thing for a sub segment of their
customer base so Andy said Home Service
I don't like that because that's I'm not
exaggerating there are like 20 million
Home Service businesses in the United
States alone 32 33 million total
businesses and 50 to 60 is percent of
them are home service businesses so what
is home service I would start with
something like gutter cleaning like not
just Niche not like pools not Roofing

[05:00]
just Niche not like pools not Roofing
but really Niche and name your business
something broad make your offer
something Niche and then I would start
with
outcraze doing that and they're probably
more likely to buy something like this
and then I want you to send ringless
voicemails to them
I use sbc.com this is not I wish they
were paying me they're not paying me
I've just used them forever there's a
bunch I like them the best and then I
would make five different
voicemails either five different
Industries with the same text F the same
script or five different scripts within
the same industry and I would send
ringless voicemails to like let's just
say a thousand people total so 200 per

[06:02]
say a thousand people total so 200 per
and I would honestly use humor with this
and say hey you didn't answer your phone
like almost aggressive because because
it's no different than a YouTube video
or a tweet the hook is everything right
hey you didn't answer your phone and I I
can help that I can help you with that
cuz we offer a receptionist service only
for gutter cleaning only for pressure
washing whatever it is you got to have
personality you got to use a dynamic
voice up don't be monotone and also
realize that a lot of these guys aren't
going to listen to this they're just
going to read it on their voicemail
transcription and then just hit up those
people you can also do mass text now it
doesn't work for every industry it
doesn't work for every instance I would
use porterhouse porterhouse doapp is
great for this because it's fully
compliant you got to have a Macbook also
not sponsored nothing's I don't have any
sponsors come on I only want Chipotle to
be my sponsor and they won't answer my
emails and just get aggressive with
ringless voicemails don't do paid ads
don't do emails you could do like cold

[07:01]
don't do emails you could do like cold
calls work but it's not nearly as as
efficient it's more effective less
efficient so for pennies you could send
ringless voicemails and hit them up with
a really attractive offer and I
guarantee you you will find customers
that way hey Chris hey you can can
everybody hear me already perfect okay
great I actually really appreciate the
time and I think everything you're doing
so far Chris Is Awesome on X and on
YouTube thank you and my my question
question is that I'm building I I
messaged you recently and I said I'm
building a a software like a SAS and
what it does is it's a like a algorithm
that goes through Google Maps or Apple's
map satellite views and street views and
then I can actually detect objects
whatever objects that my my user wants
to detect on these maps and I started
doing mom tests and talking to do doing
customer devel and then talking to my

[08:00]
customer devel and then talking to my
arborist to landscape people and and
then actually seeing what what objects
they want to detect on the map so they
can generate leads from the satellite
and street views and then I'm just
wondering I I already have one or two
customers that's paying me monthly cost
and then I'm just wondering if do you
see any kind of ways I could scale that
out and also any kind of strategies I
could use that I could really help
approach like SMB owners and then like
maybe alternative customer Niche groups
because I I only see so far anything
exterior for like Roofing solar and then
landscaping and arborist and then yeah
I've just I know you you're pretty
creative with all your your weekly
reviews so I I I would love to pick your
brain okay so do you have many
competitors on this software and what
are they charging if if so there's some
competitors I'd say Google Maps
themselves is actually the biggest ones

[09:01]
themselves is actually the biggest ones
they have actually have a solar if you
go to Google if you Google solar and and
Google Maps they actually have this
attachment where they could go and and
look at roofs and then map out the roofs
to see like how much energy you could be
saving if you put a solar panel on your
roof but my automation is actually just
going and detecting let's say houses
with pools or without pools or with
solar panels or without and then
generating leads from those and ating
mailers and and advertising to those
homeowners okay so it's not through
street view it's just through Google
Earth so you can catch stuff in the
backyard too then oh yeah yeah it it
actually does both we do we use like a
object detection algorithm and then it
does you can run through streets and
then you you can also run through solar
or satellite views okay and you really
don't have competitors doing this other
than Google's in-house solution I think
there's larger competitors I don't know

[10:00]
there's larger competitors I don't know
about I I I need to do Enterprise grade
type exactly there's Enterprise grade
that's probably built into their
estimation or like I I've seen ads for
people doing like they'll do if you want
to install solar panels or you want to
install a new roof they'll actually
either send a drone or they'll use a
really well-defined satellite view and
like do the estimate before they come
Vis actually visit you but okay yeah but
like this them because my arborist he
actually does a lot of free estimates
and he says a lot of the small medium
businesses they go and do a lot of free
estimates and then they only convert
maybe 30 if if they're good they they
convert 30 to 40% of those estimates
into users and then we just want I want
to be able to have them even be better
like developed maybe sent out free
estimates using like our like our
software

[11:00]
software
okay and what are you charging the
couple guys that you have as customers
today I'm charging like pretty monthly
flat flat free about $200 a month okay
and then if every and then I actually
have them go through I have a number
that's assigned to each account and then
if the lead goes through then I charge
them per call um and I charge a pretty
low rate I I know there's other lead
generators that are charging like $50 to
$80 a lead but we're these new customers
we're just giving them introduction
rates so I'm charging them like
$30 20 to
$30 okay and is your software so good
where could it tell you like if a tree
was dying or just that there's a tree
could it tell you there's a tree like
hanging over a house or just that
there's a tree oh we can do that but you
just have to give us examples and then
and then uh to train your software
basically exactly and then we can
actually do this thing called
augmentation or or simulation and then
we can simulate it to like I think the

[12:00]
we can simulate it to like I think the
only downside here is a lot of the
Google Maps and B maps and and Apple
Maps their images might be like a year
or two years older uh that was my next
question yeah how real time is this
imagery yeah so you can it's usually
like a year or two years out and but
then you can there's also other
satellite imaging uh databases that like
Max are or Mex there you could purchase
them per sub like subset like by state
or by county mhm and then you pay extra
but it's like buying MLS listings right
like you you would yep yeah okay all
right I think I have everything you I
need I love this idea we're going to go
ahead and disconnect you now but I've
got some good ideas for you okay so I
love this idea I don't like it makes
sense to me that there's only Enterprise
grade solutions for this but this is
going to be a thing there's no doubt
this is going to be a thing and our
caller seems to be on the Forefront of
this but like any thing that's going to
be a thing you've got to get the word

[13:00]
be a thing you've got to get the word
out there so there's the good and the
bad the good about selling something
like this is that there
are handfuls of Industries willing to
pay big bucks for this solar roofing all
of the high ticket ones okay like they
would for sure pay for this but those
guys are hit up all the time from every
marketing software and offer in the book
so it's hard to break through the noise
okay on the other side there's five six
700 Home Service brands that could use
this that could need this and want this
but I would bet 90 plus perc of them
don't like or don't normally buy
software for marketers like they're
bluecollar guys and they just they're
they're stuck in their ways so if I were
you I would start with one industry and
I'm going to say trees because that's
what I know and I'm sitting here looking
out my front window and on my neighbor's
property there's a dead tree there's
four of them and it looks like they're
on my property but they're not and I

[14:01]
on my property but they're not and I
have gotten door hangers um from tree
guys that pointed it out I was at my
brother's house in College Station he
had a huge dead oak tree and he got a
door hanger from Monster Tree Care
pointing it out and they actually had a
quote for the tree in there and so I've
been thinking for the last year like why
isn't there an automated solution where
we could click Send mailer click Send
mailer to all the houses with dead trees
or with trees hanging over the roof
trees touching the roof because if the
imagery is old and it was touching the
roof a year ago or almost touching the
roof it's especially touching the roof
now and friction will cause that roof to
break down and leak over time so now
you've got honestly you could sell that
lead to roofers and to tree trimming
companies so I like the idea of charging
and this sounds egregious charging
someone like a dollar a month just to
get their foot in the door just to get
past the friction of acquiring their
credit card number because that is the
hardest part if you can get their credit
credit card number and charge a dollar

[15:00]
credit card number and charge a dollar
you're 80% of the way there which is why
SAR TR Trends charged a dollar for the
free trial and then 300 a year because
it converts really well I've already
given my credit card so I would charge
something stupid especially if he's
brand new and no one knows about him a
dollar a month just to say all right
this guy's pot committed he's gonna
answer my call I'm gonna ask him a few
questions and then I'm going to get the
software rolling and then I would make
Integrations with one to three Direct
Mail companies that have a and there's a
lot of them out there he doesn't want to
be in the direct mail business to where
he the owner or one of his employees on
the back end can run the software for
the business owner because this bluecar
business owner is not about to learn how
to use this software so it's going to be
manual he's going to lose money doing
this uh it's going to take a lot of time
run the software on the back end and
let's say he puts in a zip code and it
spits out a 100 addresses with dead
trees or with trees hanging over the
house and then he can charge $5 per

[16:00]
house and then he can charge $5 per
address 10 whatever it is to send a
mailer and then at that point he's done
he's done he doesn't worry about
conversion rate it it doesn't affect him
he's already been paid now granted he's
going to for sure go back and ask the
business owner what was your conversion
rate hey we sent 82 mailers last month
did you get any jobs from it oh what was
the ZIP code this one oh actually yeah
my phone's been blowing up in that area
okay now I have a case study right now
he can put that front and center on his
website and he can specialize in a new
lead source for tree businesses and then
as that grows he's not going to exhaust
that for a while there's 50,000 tree
trimming companies out there he doesn't
want to name the business around trees
but he can he can specialize in trees or
whatever it is he picks but I I like to
suggest three to five different
Industries attacking at the same time to
see what the response rate is but I feel
like with how intense the software is
that would just be that'd be a lot right
so I would start with trees or something
what up fencing signage like he he could
upload a picture of like Channel letter

[17:01]
upload a picture of like Channel letter
signs that have dead letters dead
lighting and train the software on that
and then send it to to building owners
there's a zillion opportunities here but
I would charge per address and call that
a lead and then just see what the
conversion rate is and then you can
increase your prices from there so
that's what I got all right Christian
you're up Hey thank you Heath Chris
thank you so much for having me here
completely fast I I actually wasn't
going to attack but not sure if Dave
with the software engineer it's still
here I was just going to say that I
could I would like to be one of his
customers I own a roofing company here
in Miami you guys didn't mention it but
it came it's one of my ideas to have
that software looking for roofs with
tarps on them okay so if he can have his
software detecting a lot of roofs in
here in Miami brare County Palm Beach
County I cover all the Three Counties

[18:01]
County I cover all the Three Counties
down here I would be completely happy to
sign up if he can get the API with a
third company shipping out the mailers
whatever he's going to charge monthly
Subs subscriptions I really don't care
sign me up that's all I wanted to say
thank you I appreciate that yeah and I'm
honestly kicking myself for not saying
the same thing David I will be a paying
customer of yours as well and I will pay
a lot more than $1 a month if you can
tell me what trees are dead or what
trees are close to close to the power
lines or close to the road um I will pay
you for that absolutely I love the tarp
idea there's so we could have a 4-Hour
call just talking about all the ways you
could monetize that anyway love it and I
also love if anyone else has ideas like
that like ways you could add on to
something that I said please request to
speak I'd love to hear it hey Chris how
you doing man good how are you pretty
good so I'm a self-funded Searcher I've

[19:01]
good so I'm a self-funded Searcher I've
been searching for a business to buy
for 15 months at this point so quite the
journey as I've looked at a lot of
businesses and learned more and more one
model like sticks in my
brain and it's uh custom souvenirs so
there was one that I saw that was I fell
in love with this
business and so they did custom
souvenirs for like gift shop
museums tourist attractions everything's
obviously custom made to order they had
it was like a million dollars per
employee in Revenue wow so custom so
this is all B2B then right whale custom
so they glori customized what give me an
example of an item that would be
customized and how magnets pins okay
like Zion National Park exactly exactly
you go through you go to a park you exit
out the gift shop all those little
custom things specifically magnets so

[20:00]
custom things specifically magnets so
their their this business specifically
their top sellers were magnets and
keychains they also do some pins enamel
pins but I thought it was just so
fascinating the fact that they get these
customers they're extremely sticky right
you do a good job they're coming back to
you for fresh designs they're refreshing
their stock every so often right but I
couldn't so my background is onl
marketing digital marketing web
development right so that's really
anything really related to technology is
my background right but I don't know how
to tackle these guys so they have just
the company I was looking at for
example they were just in the market for
so long 30 years and they had just
established a snowball they never did
any marketing all they did was they
would go to two trade shows a year so a
slow buildup so I guess my question to
you would be is how would you think
think of this in trying to from maybe a

[21:00]
think of this in trying to from maybe a
digital marketing standpoint or or a
gorilla marketing I don't know some way
to do it at scale and reach out to these
gift shops right because there's
thousands and thousands right every
single small town every tourist
destination every all these people are
all buying the same types of things
right ideally customed to them how would
you approach it I guess that's F how
would I approach basically building one
of these businesses from scratch yeah
exactly so let's say you had a designer
right you know where you're going to get
it in China or some other country
getting the stuff made I know all of
that it's more so the sales custom yeah
customer best way to so you mentioned
like ringless voicemails I was like
interesting but I don't know how you
would even get those people how do you
find these because I know it's you're
working with like buyers right so
typically there's a specific job title
maybe that's an opportunity so I've
never dealt with this like distributor
buyer relationship you know B2B stuff
it's normally I've been like direct
consumer and doing push or pull
marketing right so so in this business

[22:02]
marketing right so so in this business
your end buyer isn't in the the gift
shop it's like a a buyer for a chain of
gift shops is that what you're saying
almost every gift shop has a buyer right
so okay they're GNA have a position
right so you they'll have a
merchandising Department probably that's
like probably two or three
people maybe it's one person depending
on how small it is but a lot of the
times it's going to be counties or it's
gonna be larger entities right these are
pretty profitable this is how they're
making their money for the most part
right these tourist attractions is
through their merch or their you know
their gift shops and their souvenirs so
yeah they typically have a couple people
they have the higher level person and
then you'll have a is far as I
understand it right so just from what
I've learned there will be a buyer like
a specific person who does this and goes
out and maybe solicits bids from people
or asks for a RFP or something yeah now
so you tried to buy one of these and

[23:01]
so you tried to buy one of these and
then you weren't able to have you looked
for more to buy are you still willing to
buy one I would love to buy one so yeah
I would love to buy one so this one
specifically they took it off the market
so she okay she just had made so much
money that she she actually ended up
just selling it to her employees so she
actually was like you know what I was
I'm gonna get so she got so was gonna
get so killed on taxes with the sale
that she was like it's not even about
money she wanted to just take care of
her employees and so they did like an
ESOP exit okay all right I think I've
got everything I need appreciate it all
right thank you all right if I were
James I would take all of that energy
and all of that effort figuring out how
to acquire these retail gift shop
customers and put that into figuring out
how to acquire a company that sells to
them I think that in this and almost any
industry the reasons that make it such a
good business is because it is so hard
to acquire customers furthermore once
that a customer is acquired it is so

[24:01]
that a customer is acquired it is so
hard to lose them I've been in this
world I've sold B2B wholesale I sold B2B
wholesale iPhone parts we sold $2 to
$3,000 worth of parts per month per
customer our reorder rate was like
94% okay and so I've been on both sides
of this because I've also owned a chain
of iPhone repair stores buying this
stuff okay I like I'm I'm over here
thinking all right how would I okay
rless voicemail how would I find a get
and then he tells me there's two or
three and then it's sometimes it's a
buyer sometimes they're in store this
sounds like a nightmare it sounds like
buying or selling to school districts or
to health care companies it's just I
don't like it that's why waste
management is such a great monopolized
business is because you got to get these
contracts and It's tricky to get these
contracts but then once you get it if
you don't screw up if you literally just
show up and take the trash away you'll
keep it for years or decades right
that's why these are blowing up that's

[25:00]
that's why these are blowing up that's
why these are being rolled up so if I
were James and he's he called himself a
Searcher a self-funded Searcher so he's
not against buying a business clearly I
would make a database of every single
company that sells uh gifts to gift
shops custom gifts there's probably less
than a hundred of them and where's he
gonna find them honestly I would hire
five different vas and just say I don't
know how you're going to get it I have
no advice just go get it and then take
those five different lists put them
together remove the duplicates there's
your database you could use outs scraper
you could use LinkedIn you could use
Apollo but it sounds ha sounds messy I
would get that database and then I would
just start brt building a relationship
of trust with the owners putting his
name out there sending him a gift basket
sending him a letter shooting him a text
shooting him an email giving him a call
hey this is who I am this is my story
I've had a 9o5 job I hate it I want to
be a business owner like you I love your
your business no one's passionate about

[26:01]
your business no one's passionate about
custom souvenirs to gift shops But Me
You Are I Am you've never met someone
not in the industry that was as
passionate about this industry as I am
they will take to him like like flies to
Honey right they will be so flattered
that someone cares about their little
industry that they will want to sell to
him eventually and it's the law of large
numbers if there's 86 businesses out
there that he could potentially buy and
none of them want to sell right now in a
month one of them's going to want to
sell in six months probably eight of
them are going to want to sell so he's
just got to play the long game he's
already playing it he's been at it for
14 months just forget starting one from
scratch that sounds like a nightmare I'd
rather do anything else on this planet
and starting that type of business from
scratch but I as well would for sure buy
that type of business hey man hey how
are you yeah pretty good pretty good so
my name is Ed I don't have a so I'm
running a business right now but the

[27:00]
running a business right now but the
idea that I want to swing by you is not
really something that I currently do I'm
just very interested in seeing how you
would deconstruct this is that a cool
yeah so I've been fascinated for a very
long time about the waste management
business it's one of the more
traditional recurring bluecollar
businesses out there but it's very
monopolized right it's very controlled
among very few big National companies I
I had recently seen a post I don't know
if it cross your radar from Spencer
Scott he started a waste collection
business in a town in Texas not sure
where it is so his house is like seven
minutes away from
mine neighborhood like every week yeah
so at that post a few months ago got my
wheel spinning because I always been
interested in that and I think how he
targeted how he got into it was through
like HOA targeting now I don't know how
much it varies from state to State I
don't know like I'm in Missouri for

[28:00]
don't know like I'm in Missouri for
example and lots of the businesses here
in Missouri like the trash businesses
like you have to bid out a contract
through the local city
municipality now I was like okay how
would I so I want to share how I would
bootstrap it if I were doing it here and
I'm interested to see how you would do
it as well so you're going to be
competing against big players obviously
but if you go around like next door or
Facebook groups you're going to see a
lot of discontent with people that had
like with their own like waste business
and I see it a lot in smaller towns
right you gotta drive out 30 30 40
minutes out of City centers to really
get the the nitty-gritty in my opinion
but I would probably Target HOAs
probably be the easiest I would probably
if I were to do this I would probably go
with any communities that give me
density
so I think that's how Spencer did it but

[29:00]
so I think that's how Spencer did it but
you may have more like more info than I
do but I'm just curious like how would
you go about something like this in the
Modern Age knowing all the different
tools that we have in our disposal to do
something like this would you also
consider in addition to HOAs just to get
your name out there maybe targeting
Trash valet as a way to get in to Market
to multifam developments I don't know if
trash Val is a thing in in Texas but
here in in Missouri and St Louis it a
lot of the landlords big property
management companies use it as a as an
amenity for tenants but I wonder if
that's a way to get in because if you
talk to a lot of these landlords a lot
of these property managers they usually
don't like their Waste Management vendor
they you go to these dumpsters they're
always full they're always stuff are
filling out usually they miss their
trash day they're moving things all the
time so I'm I don't know so I'm just
curious I want to want to get your input
how would you approach it because I I'm

[30:00]
how would you approach it because I I'm
interested to see what kind of angle you
have that I haven't really thought about
how much money are you willing to commit
to this
idea so I would
probably 100K if I were to give a number
and on a scale of 1 to 10 how serious
are you about it about eight okay and
are you what are you doing right now
like a full-time job or business so
right now I have a business that I'm
committed to 100% so I run a recruit
business so that's what I see myself
doing for the most part for the rest of
the year but this is something that
looking to explore a little bit down the
line I wouldn't say it's an immediate
thing and do you live nearby like many
rural areas that that might be up for
bidding on something like this here the
near future yeah and also I live nearby
lots of like little like HOA like spots
as well in addition to just small rural
municipality towns it's like exer
really that are pretty much growing in

[31:00]
really that are pretty much growing in
the St Louis area yeah okay all right I
think I've got what I need I'm going to
give you my prescription so what was
your name again what was his name Ed all
right so I love that you said you have a
100K to put into this and I love that
you're an eight out of 10 because I was
prepared to say don't do this idea
because most ideas especially in this
internet age you can test relatively
cheaply and quickly this one uh you you
can't so so I've been following
Spencer's story I've talked to Spencer
he's a great guy and I would bet that if
Spencer were here he would admit that he
would not have done this business had he
not just struck lightning in a bottle
and I know the neighborhood he lives in
and he just hit it just right where all
the stars aligned that he was able to
put that up for bid and he posted in the
Facebook group and it took off and he
happens to be a brilliant marketer like
he owns a a marketing software company
like he's super super good at marketing
and so if if he doesn't trash issues in
his neighborhood like four different

[32:00]
his neighborhood like four different
things don't happen he doesn't start
this business okay and he started it and
I've been watching his videos and it's
awesome to be determined how well how
well he does how big he gets or what
have you that said I do like this
business but it's it's not something you
can just test so if I were Ed I would
get on NEX stor get on these Facebook
groups identify three to five
communities hopefully somewhat close to
each other that are in need of something
like this or will be up for bid for
something like this and then build your
website and put up one to two different
Billboards in that area specifically
Billboards if someone sees a billboard
they're not thinking oh yeah this guy's
just probably testing out this trash
business oh wow this guy has a billboard
he's legit it's like Michael Scott when
he says his friend owns a quiz NOS on
the turnpike must be a billionaire and
that's just what people think Billboards
are like three to6 $700 a month a lot of
times it's month-to month a lot of times

[33:00]
times it's month-to month a lot of times
that includes the vinyl it's not as
expensive as you think and so I would
put up a website and one to two
Billboards in that area before he even
buys a truck before he even shops for
trucks and then just start planting
seeds maybe a direct mail campaign maybe
cold calling to HOA presidents or HOA
management companies and putting feelers
out there and then actually bidding for
a job and then when you bid for a job
you just put your start date out a
couple months win a job buy a truck
figure it out like if he is that
committed eight out of 10 100 Grand a
truck is going to be a fraction of that
you only need one you only need to pick
up one or two days a week he could do
that himself especially if he's a
business owner I think it's a great idea
because it seems like these stars are
aligning and he has communities in that
area where he could pitch something like
this to and I like that this is a
monopolized industry it's monopolized
for a reason because this is a freaking
great business people are rolling it up
for a reason and so if call it 80% of

[34:00]
for a reason and so if call it 80% of
the waste management companies out there
are owned by a massive Corporation great
the other 20% are up for grabs so yeah
that's what I would do I like the idea
sweet hi Chris firstly thank you for
putting together these spaces I think
it's a big help for our community on
Twitter um absolutely my question is
regarding franchises I didn't hear you
speak too much about
franchises more particular ly what's
popular in the Northeast around the tri-
state area is something called
pliables it's like a fruit bowl
restaurant that has like an assai base
or Paya base and it's actually growing
really quickly I saw an article in
Entrepreneur magazine from last
month and they were expressing how it's
a very good opportunity how they only
have 220 stores right now now and how
they're doing much better than Jamba

[35:00]
they're doing much better than Jamba
Juice and all the others the average
revenue per store is $1.1 million
there's no cooking involved obviously
there's a franchise fee and you got to
build out a store
space and you got to pay 7% of the
revenue also a royalty maybe another 1%
or 2% for marketing and other things but
in general a franchise like this what
are your
thoughts okay all right I think I've got
what I need wait I have one more thing
to add there is a new mall here in New
Jersey it's called American dream it
might have almost 200,000 daily visitors
they do not have a pliables yet I looked
up in I found the pdf online for about
the franchise and they limit two mile
radius from another branch that you can
open one but the closest one is more
than two miles away I think that's a
good opportunity this mall is new it has

[36:02]
good opportunity this mall is new it has
a lot of traffic already it's new it's
modern I've been there many times I see
the potential I know that you mentioned
in one of your tweets about a mechanical
bull I don't know if that's as popular
in the Northeast as it is down in Texas
but they do have those little these
animal ride rides that you can ride
around and I think that's making a
killing that's another thing to talk
about but this m think would be a good
opportunity to pair with a franchise
like pliables what do you think okay all
right thank you so my prescription for
Clifton is okay I love franchises I
don't like this idea I don't I think
assai BS have peaked they might be doing
great as a franchise and a lot of times
they've got 220 locations a lot of times
that's because something like assai BS
have peaked on a macro sense but they
haven't peaked yet on her Market sense I
know there was one in Tuscaloosa Alabama

[37:01]
know there was one in Tuscaloosa Alabama
that opened and they were just crushing
it and lying out the door and they're
gone right same thing right around the
corner there was a cupcake shop that
opened line out the door they were doing
10 grand a day in cupcakes that arrived
Frozen from the the corporate
headquarters they're gone now right I
just don't like these Niche food
Concepts because I look at everything
with upside vers downside I feel like
you have much more downside on a niche
food concept the upside is 1.1 million a
year Topline you're probably going to
net call it 15% of that 150 Grand a year
after
investing 150 350 500 in buildout that
you're never going to recoup recoup in
equipment 7% Topline to the franchise or
what I would do if you haven't already
done this go to the Minnesota website go
to the FDD the database directory if
they have a location in Minnesota it has
to be listed there look at how many
stores they've closed not just opened

[38:01]
stores they've closed not just opened
also take anything entrepreneur.com says
with a grain of salt because they get
the most of their revenue from
franchisors who pay them big fees to
pitch their franchises so yeah
entrepreneur.com thinks every franchise
is awesome because they're all paying
them so if you're willing to do a
franchise like if you've wrapped your
mind around that like the the couple
callers ago he's willing to buy a
business then just transfer that
willingness that energy to a better
franchise with less downside and more
upside I was talking to a guy that owns
a franchise the other day that like they
save business's money uh I forget the
name of it if you DM me I'll send you a
link and it's like very little startup
cost you don't need a physical location
the churn is next to zero he'll go into
a small business and he'll cut their
credit card processing he'll cut their
shipping rates and there's like a third
one they're vendors or something and
then he'll take 50% of the savings
forever so this guy learned how to do
this then he's franchising this into
multiple territories and they're

[39:01]
multiple territories and they're
crushing it they're also making seven
figures a year on average but with much
higher margins no buildout I just think
there's H literally hundreds of other
franchise opportunities that have higher
upside and lower downside I wouldn't do
an oai Bowl if you're going to go to a
mall then buy a freaking mechanical bowl
and put it in the mall and tell me how
it goes because I'm gonna I'm not gonna
be able to scratch that itch until
someone does it or I do it myself I love
it thank you everyone for joining us on
