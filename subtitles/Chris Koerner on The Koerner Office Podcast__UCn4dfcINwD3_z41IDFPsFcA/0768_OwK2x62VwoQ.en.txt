[00:00]
I lost probably $50 million over the
course of making all the shows and I
would do it again. I suffer from
debilitating depression and anxiety. And
the reason that I work as much as I do
is because it medicates me. Sundays are
my least favorite day of the whole week.
I hate them. And I love Monday. Monday
I'm fired up and I start firing off
emails. And that's what I would tell
anybody that feels like they don't know
what to do with their lives. His
business is a safe place.
&gt;&gt; I grew up poor. no money for food and
entrepreneurship gave me everything. I
want everyone that's curious, that wants
to try it, wants to taste business
ownership, I want to help them get there
so at least they can answer that
question for themselves.
&gt;&gt; It's my connection to humanity.
&gt;&gt; I don't know what I would do or who I
would be if I didn't have business. If
you want to be a good business person,
you have to try things that make you
wildly uncomfortable.
&gt;&gt; One of my all-time business heroes is
Marcus Lamonus. He is the star of the
hit NBC show, The Profit, and he is a
business addict. He is a shiny
object-driven entrepreneur just like

[01:00]
object-driven entrepreneur just like
myself. I've looked up to him for 15
years. And so I ran into him by accident
at Caesar's Palace in Vegas. And I said,
"Marcus, can I interview you?" He said,
"Absolutely." So I flew all the way here
to New York City where I am right now.
And I spent an hour and a half with him
and it was one of the best hours and a
half of my life. So we discuss
everything from the profit learnings,
regrets, failures, how to start a
business, what ideas he loves, what
ideas he hates. I hope you enjoy.
So, you remind me of myself for a lot of
reasons, right? I think people might
look at you and say, "This guy isn't
focused. He's doing all these things.
You got to focus, focus, focus." Let me
tell you my theory, and I know you won't
be afraid to tell me if it's total BS.
I'm just justifying my own life. Or if
you agree with it, right? And maybe
you're the most biased person to ask.
&gt;&gt; I think people should focus on their
superpower. And maybe that's across a
dozen businesses. Maybe it's all in on
one. And people assume focus means
focusing on one business, one thing. But
I like to focus on my superpower,
delegate the things that I I hate or I'm

[02:00]
delegate the things that I I hate or I'm
bad at, and that's how I live my life.
Is that just BS?
&gt;&gt; No. I think there's a more vulnerable
layer there that that you probably
should spend time unpacking yourself. I
get bored easy.
&gt;&gt; Same.
&gt;&gt; And I like shiny objects. And if you and
I were doing a deal and I was really hot
on it and then you went on vacation for
a week, I'm out.
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; And it's not a good quality, but it is
what it is. The same thing happens to me
with ideas. I have an idea addiction.
And every idea I have isn't a good one.
I find myself
wanting to be more focused. I have a
high level of self-awareness that in
many cases I'm not capable of it. Mhm.
&gt;&gt; I actually don't have the ability to do
it. I think I could say, "Yeah, I could
delegate." For me, I've had to I think
the big pivot for me is if I want to be
the way that I am, I have to accept the

[03:00]
the way that I am, I have to accept the
things that come with that. And I have
to do one thing materially different,
which is I have to hire way up or
partner way up because all those people
need to fill the many gaps that I have.
Mhm.
&gt;&gt; I liked being a connector. I like doing
deals.
I don't mind the early stages of running
it, but once it's kind of going, I'm
like, "Okay,
&gt;&gt; I'm bored."
&gt;&gt; You got that
&gt;&gt; exact same.
&gt;&gt; I don't want to do that. I don't like
I've never started a business in my
entire life.
&gt;&gt; Really?
&gt;&gt; I don't know how.
&gt;&gt; I mean, you do.
&gt;&gt; I don't know how.
&gt;&gt; It's bias for action. You just
&gt;&gt; I don't know how.
&gt;&gt; Interesting.
&gt;&gt; And I have no interest in doing it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I have interest in taking your
idea
or her idea
and thinking about it differently and
ultimately I have one goal and that's to
get the best version of you so that the
business can be the best version of
itself. That is what I love to do.

[04:02]
itself. That is what I love to do.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Hard stop.
&gt;&gt; Now back to your example of if I partner
with you and then you go on vacation.
What about the reverse?
&gt;&gt; I didn't partner with you. We were going
to do a deal.
&gt;&gt; Who? you wanted to sell me a business.
You, whoever the person is, we were
talking about doing I can think of one
specifically. I'm looking at trying to
merge one public company with the one of
the public companies that I oversee
today. And I was hot on it. Hot on it.
Hot on it. And then the person is like,
"Oh, well, I'm thinking about some other
things and I need to do this." And I
said to him, I'm just telling you that
fire and that flame in me is going to
go. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And when it goes, there's no relighting
it. I'm going to move on to something
else.
&gt;&gt; Time kills all deals.
&gt;&gt; It kills the fire for me.
&gt;&gt; What about the other side of it? What if
you partner with someone or you start
it? You've never started. You you buy a
business
&gt;&gt; and then you get shiny object and you
move on and they're like, "Marcus,
what's going on, man? We were doing
this." Does that happen? That's happened

[05:01]
this." Does that happen? That's happened
to me.
&gt;&gt; It happens, but it happens in a
different way. People will know upfront
because they should have a high level of
like knowledge that I'm not going to
work at their business every day.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And too often I've made the mistake of
getting involved or making an investment
and I romanticize it so much and I spend
so much time with them right up front.
Then that time can't continue that way.
I I can't.
&gt;&gt; And they can. And then they become
disheartened or they feel like we broke
up or they feel like I left them behind
and then they get mad and then it leads
to it escalates. And I'll say to them,
"Did you actually think that I was going
to make the popcorn every day or walk
the dog every day?" Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Like, "Did you actually think that was
going to happen?" They're like, "I did."
And I said, ' Okay, well, either I did a
bad job of clearly saying to you, we're
going to be together for a week. At the

[06:00]
going to be together for a week. At the
end of that week, you're going to see me
twice a month, and at the end of a year,
you're going to see me once a month, and
at the end of the next year, you may see
me once a quarter. I don't do a good job
of
&gt;&gt; because I'm I would never go into a
relationship and say to somebody, "We're
going to start off hot and then it's
going to go cold."
Do you structure like the equity of your
deals differently being self-aware of
that today? If they're expecting you to
spend more time with them and they want
to give you 30%, do you say, "Listen,"
because this is what I do. People come
to me and they say, "Chris, give me 10
hours a week, I'll give you 10% of the
business." And I say, "Let's do 1% of
the business and 30 minutes a week." And
I just try to tell them upfront, I'm
going to be much less involved than you
think.
&gt;&gt; You always do that?
&gt;&gt; No. That's This is a very new
development. I'm going to spend less
time in this, but I'm I'm willing to
take much less of the business because I
have my hands in a million pots.
&gt;&gt; That's something for me to learn from. I
would probably take it a step further
and say, I don't want any equity in your
business, but I'm going to give you all

[07:00]
business, but I'm going to give you all
that I can and it will be inconsistent.
And if at some point the things that I
did helped you, you could do me a solid.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But that's on you. I don't want the
formality of the relationship. I don't
take equity in businesses like I used to
unless I'm actually going to be in them
because I started to accumulate a bunch
of little things
&gt;&gt; that ended up being not worth much or I
would give them back and in the end I
would be like I just what was that?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. How many different businesses
would you say you've had equity on other
than like stocks and
&gt;&gt; Well, I've only owned two stocks in my
entire life, Camping World and Beyond.
I've never bought a stock of a business
that I wasn't involved in.
&gt;&gt; Wow.
&gt;&gt; Because I don't I'm
&gt;&gt; You're not involved in them.
&gt;&gt; I have a problem. It's a I think I just
can't do it. I would say how many
businesses have received money from me
and I've gotten some form of something
either equity or debt
&gt;&gt; over a hundred. How many of them have
worked out?

[08:00]
worked out?
&gt;&gt; You got ahead of my next question.
&gt;&gt; Less than 10. Fun fact, 80% of the
people that watch my YouTube videos are
not subscribed to me. And most of them
think they are. They see them in the
feed, but they're not subscribed to me.
So, please, it'll take half a second,
just click subscribe, and it would mean
a ton to me. Less than 10 of them. So,
less than 10%. Yep. Wow. What does that
tell you? It tells me that I live my
life in two stacks of business. true
capitalism in my big businesses where
I'm pushing and driving for 7 billion,
10 billion, 12 billion dollars of
business, public two public companies
that I'm running and I run those very
differently. Yeah, there's relationships
that are involved but I'm very maniacal
about them. The other one feels like
something that I'm passionate about and
it is my form of giving back. And I went
into it with the mindset that I was
going to make a lot of money. And
halfway through I realized that that was

[09:01]
halfway through I realized that that was
not going to happen. And I kept going
and the consequences got more
complicated.
But I continue to do it today. I just
structure it differently. I'll say to
people, I want you to do these things,
and it costs $55,000 to do it. I'm going
to give you the 55,000.
You don't have to sign anything. I gave
you 55,000. You decide
what you think that should look like. I
don't want equity in your business
because I don't want to deal with K1s
and and I don't I don't know what you're
doing on a daily basis, and it's your
business. So think about it not as a
grant or a gift, but think about it as
like I'm doing you a solid. You have to
figure out how you're going to do me
one, too. Because I realized that the
time that I was spending on those small
businesses was taking away from the
amount of effort and capital that needed
to go into the big businesses. And I
started to feel sad about it that, oh, I
still want to do both. And so I said to

[10:01]
still want to do both. And so I said to
myself, okay, I'm going to take a
portion of what I have or a portion of
what I get on an annual basis or a
portion of what whatever it is and I'm
just going to say to myself, that's it.
That's what I'm going to do with it.
It's not a gift. I have high
expectations. I'm going to hold your
feet to the fire. But when I formalize
things with you, it sticks me to the tar
more than it sticks you.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. and the liability for me and the
risk for me don't outweigh the return
for me.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; If I give you something and you want to
tell people that I'm your partner, I
don't have a problem with it. I'm proud
to be associated with you until I'm not
until you misbehave. And if you want to
call me about anything and you want to
text me about anything or you need me to
come do whatever, I'll do all of those
things to the extent that I can. But I
don't need you to be obligated to me.
It's not a good place for me because
then I get resentment.
&gt;&gt; I would think that if I give someone
55,000 and say, "Hey, just give me what

[11:00]
55,000 and say, "Hey, just give me what
you feel is right sometime in the
future." And then I go off and do all
these other things, most people won't
follow up. And I'm optimistic about
people like you.
&gt;&gt; Some do.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. A minority of people.
&gt;&gt; I know. But the ones that do make it
worth it for me. The ones that will say
to me, and I've had many say, "You gave
me 55 and my business went from X to Y,
not because you're 55, but because of
the time we spent together. The 55 was a
great bridge. You got me out of trouble.
I learned a lot. I love the fact that we
could talk and you give me the honest
feedback. You helped me in ways that I
can't express. And I want to give you
150 back." And I'll say to them, first
of all, thank you. You don't have to
give me 150 back. You can give me my 55
back. If you want to give me a little
interest because it's like the right
thing to do, I'll take that. And people
will say to me, "No, no, I can't do it
that way because when I needed it, you
were there for me. And now my business
went from 2 million to 20 million and I

[12:01]
went from 2 million to 20 million and I
can't afford to give it to you."
&gt;&gt; And my response is, I know you can. What
else could you do with the money?
&gt;&gt; Are there some team members that deserve
a raise? Is there something that needs
to happen?
More recently though, I've said I'll
take the 150 because I want to build the
discipline.
&gt;&gt; If they I started to think like what
message am I sending them if they
have offered to pay it back and I don't
take it back? Am I sending a bad
message? And I think ultimately I was.
So I take it now.
&gt;&gt; Has your hit rate on finding people like
that gotten better over the years? And
if so, what signals do you look for when
you hand that 55 grand over?
&gt;&gt; It's only gotten better because I've
become more judicious with my choices,
which makes me a little bummed out
because I wish I could help everybody
all the time. And it's not a money
thing. It's a expectation thing that I
can't fulfill. But I've figured out what
the signals are and what the attributes

[13:00]
the signals are and what the attributes
are. And the characteristics of those
people are they ask a lot of questions.
They communicate without me having to
communicate to them. They send me
information that I didn't ask for. They
are overly transparent and they share
more than anybody would expect. And
that's a sign to me that I have nothing
to hide and I want you to see
everything.
They tend to be the kind of folks that
just want a relationship
&gt;&gt; and they just want to feel like they
have a cord that they can pull on. I
tend to be pretty liberal with that to
my own peril. And that's what started to
become a bigger problem for me. I want
some of my time back.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And I want some of my life back.
&gt;&gt; Because sometimes if they're
overcommunicating, it's because of the
relationship because they want to
exploit that at some point in the future
&gt;&gt; or they want to No. No. No, I don't
think it's an exploitation thing.
&gt;&gt; Not exploit, but like asking for favors.
&gt;&gt; They want to know. No, they I think they
like the connection. They feel like

[14:02]
like the connection. They feel like
that's the way to stay connected. And
they're probably not wrong.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Because it's a bit of out of sight, out
of mind. There's a small business in
Pennsylvania. Excuse me. Yeah.
Pennsylvania and Maryland. And it was an
episode of The Profit. And it was a
Greek family, young lady and her two
brothers. And
&gt;&gt; what was the business? I think
&gt;&gt; Zoe's Chocolates.
&gt;&gt; I think I remember that. and a Greek
Greek family and some of the hardest
working people ever and I did more for
them than they ever asked for and it
cost a lot of money to do it all and
they were so adamant about paying it
back and I said to them but I didn't ask
you to do these things you don't have to
pay it back the portion that I gave you
for working capital you have to pay that
back
&gt;&gt; and you could pay me interest every
month we could do whatever not only did
They pay it back. And not only do they
pay it back with interest, but there
isn't a hol I haven't I haven't seen
them in probably seven years. I maybe

[15:00]
them in probably seven years. I maybe
talked to them two, three times a year.
There's not a holiday that goes by of
any kind, could be Fourth of July, where
a box doesn't show up to my house with a
note with a whole assortment of gifts
that just say thank you.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And for me, if they called me
tomorrow and they said, "We're in
trouble." There isn't anything that they
could ask me for that I wouldn't do.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And you know that they're not
sending that to you to ask a favor in
the future. You know, they're genuine
good people. And that makes up for the
10 people that you partnered with where
it didn't work out.
&gt;&gt; It didn't work out. I had another I had
another group that maybe one of my most
proud moments of the entire series where
there's these two brothers in um Seal
Beach, California. um Anderson Brothers.
There was three brothers in the business
and the one brother died and they're
young. They're our age, your age. I was
really taken aback by I had never I
couldn't even imagine like as a parent

[16:01]
couldn't even imagine like as a parent
what that would mean to lose your child,
as a brother what that would mean to
lose a sibling. And I invested both
money and time and I've gotten all my
money back and then some. and their
business went from 2 million a year to
20 million a year. And not a day goes by
where I see them do an interview or I
hear something somewhere eight years
later will always say this is what
helped us. He helped us. He lent us
money. We got out of this. But what he
really did is he got us focused and he
got us over the loss of our brother and
he got us to get along and he got us to
change the our whole business model
&gt;&gt; and he did it in such a loving way and a
stern way that even though he's not
legally our partner, we tell everybody
he's our partner.
&gt;&gt; And I called him up one day and I said,
"Hey, I saw this interview that you did.
You guys told people that I'm not
legally your partner, but I am your

[17:01]
legally your partner, but I am your
partner." I said, "Well, a I'm flattered
by that, but let me tell you what you
did for me." And I think the biggest
misnomer about the show when I meet
people is like, "Oh, you helped this
person and that person and this person
and that person." And I will say to
people, "No, maybe I helped them, but I
got a lot out of it." Well, what did you
learn?
&gt;&gt; Well, I learned about their industry.
&gt;&gt; I learned about what not to do. I
learned about certain behavioral traits.
I learned a lot about that type of
personality and how to deal with them. I
learned a lot about myself. I learned a
lot about my my gaps and my flaws. And I
reaffirmed the things that I was good
at. And it gave me confidence to do
other things or it changed the way I
operate my big businesses because I was
able to do it in this petri dish. Mhm.
&gt;&gt; I lost probably 50

[18:00]
million dollars
over the course of making all the shows
and I would do it again.
&gt;&gt; Like personally?
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh. Nobody ever invested but me.
&gt;&gt; Wow. Just investing in these small
businesses.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I would do it again.
&gt;&gt; Wow.
I through all the legal drama, through
all the TV drama, through all the good
and the bad, at the end of the day,
while I people know that I do other
things that I sell campers or I sell bed
sheets, that's not what people will
remember me for. And as an only child,
adopted only child with parents gone, I
used to spend a lot of time thinking
like, what do I want to be known for?
What do I want? How do I want to leave
my thumbrint? And for me, I just came
from a an event at the Javit Center
talking to at an an event there. And
when I hear people say like, "Oh, I
learned a lot or I thought about things
differently or I was entertained or or I

[19:01]
differently or I was entertained or or I
was inspired or whatever word people
would use." The return on investment for
me for that,
I don't know if I could put a price tag
on it. And you know what's even crazier?
when I lost all that money, and I'm not
embarrassed to admit this, I didn't know
how to record the losses on my taxes,
like because I never took equity in
them. So, I was like, "Is it marketing
or if I did take equity, was it a
capital loss?" And I had the IRS come
and audit and they did an audit of a
couple of the years and the the auditor
said to me,
&gt;&gt; "We've never seen anything like this.
This just looks totally fraudulent." I
was like,
&gt;&gt; "Go watch the show."
&gt;&gt; And she did. And then she came back to
me and said, "Well, the deal that you
did," I was like,
"I ended up giving way more money. I
can't think of a case, and I've been I
can't think of a situation. I've been
challenged on this where I didn't invest
or spend or give infinitely more money

[20:01]
or spend or give infinitely more money
than anybody ever saw on that episode.
&gt;&gt; Infinitely more
&gt;&gt; just because they needed it.
Well, yeah, we'll go with that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Was there like an 8020 rule of that 50
million? Were there a couple businesses
that just bled you dry or was it pretty
evenly distributed?
&gt;&gt; They didn't bleed me dry because that
would that would imply that they had
malice in their heart. But I clean that
up for their sake. I'm sure that in life
there's people that are good and there's
people that are not good. I've decided
not to cast any sort of opinion on that.
People have to live with their own
decisions. I'll say this, there were a
subset of people who always did the
right thing like there is in life and
there are people who made choices for
whatever reason that they made them for
that didn't work out for me.
&gt;&gt; When it comes to people, process,
product,
&gt;&gt; y

[21:00]
&gt;&gt; y
&gt;&gt; 8020 of that has got to be people,
right? I mean, when you walk away from a
business on the profit, you move on to
the next one. of the ones that just go
back down, is it usually people related?
They just don't keep doing what you told
them to do or is it something else?
&gt;&gt; In most cases, the businesses did fine
after. In some cases, they weren't going
to make it no matter what.
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; No amount of money could have fixed it
because ultimately it is a people
business is a people business. But
what's changed for me recently,
particularly with AI, is that process
does matter. When you have technology
like AI giving your competitors an
advantage if they use it properly to be
smarter, to improve their supply chain,
to improve their pricing, to be able to
use scrape data, to know how to source
better, to know how to market better, to
know how to to know how to convert
better, to know how to do anything
better. Process will matter more in the
next decade. And I'm nervous and fearful

[22:04]
next decade. And I'm nervous and fearful
that people are gonna matter less.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And that is that's a pretty frightening
thing because I've lived my whole life
and I still believe it today that people
are the difference maker. But maybe it's
1% less tomorrow than it was yesterday.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And that's coming from an
optimist.
&gt;&gt; I'm a super optimist. I'm actually
Whatever's above optimism, I live in
fantasy land.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So do I. You have to to be a
serial entrepreneur. You have to to not
want to stop doing it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; To believe the good in everybody and
that everything's going to work out.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, when I have a win, it
compensates for 20 losses. I forget the
losses. I remember the wins. It's just
so much sweeter for me.
&gt;&gt; Do you?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You forget them.
&gt;&gt; So, I have a theory that insecurities
drive us to be our best or our worst
selves. Right. If we're if we're
self-aware of the insecurity, it can
propel us to be our best selves. And so
I'm a big believer in the chip on the
shoulder. And if someone screws me or if

[23:01]
shoulder. And if someone screws me or if
I have a bad deal or just outright a
toxic relationship, that propels me more
than like my mom saying, "I'm so proud
of you, son."
&gt;&gt; You know, so I don't know what that is
or what you call that, but
&gt;&gt; I used to have that chip on my shoulder.
I got rid of it. Unfortunately, it
turned into wiping it from my memory
&gt;&gt; as opposed to like having it be a
motivator for me. It needed to be a lost
thought because it would contaminate me,
I think, far too much. I love business
so much because it's people always say
that food is a unifier for me. Business
is a is a unifier and it's my connection
to humanity. Mhm.
&gt;&gt; I don't know what I would do or what I
would be or who I would be if I didn't
have business.
&gt;&gt; Do you feel an obligation to keep making
content about business?
&gt;&gt; I do. Recently, you know, I started
making a new version of The Profit at
Fox called The Fixer. I would tell you
that this has been the last 12 months

[24:00]
that this has been the last 12 months
have been a more of a learning curve for
me than ever around content. And the
nice thing about being at Fox is our
show airs at Fox Network where The
Simpsons and NFL airs, but it's all
connected to Fox News, Fox Business, and
everything else. I had been at CNBC for
a decade, which was an amazing platform,
and I I'm grateful eternally, but in the
end, I needed to to move on to see a
different see a different part of the
world and and do something different.
And going to Fox was a totally different
place. Like ideologically and
politically and philosophically is a
different place. And I wanted to dump
myself into a tank that would be
uncomfortable for me.
&gt;&gt; And the way that they wanted to handle
my dissemination of content was very
different. So I'll tell you a quick
story. We're making the Fixer. It would
air on Fox. It reairs on Fox Business
and airs on Hulu and all these other
places. They brought me on to different
shows, as you would imagine, to promote
the show. And so I would go on to Fox
and Friends in the morning or I would do

[25:01]
and Friends in the morning or I would do
something on Fox Business. And over time
I started doing more and more and more.
It was almost becoming invigorating for
me because I was able to take my
experience as a business person, big
business person and small business
person and mush them together and plug
them into real world events. So about
three months ago, one of the senior
people there said to me, "Hey, we had
somebody call in sick. You're going to
co-anchor the news tonight." And I was
like, "No, I'm not." I was like, "No,
I'm not." And I was like, "Why not?" I
was like, "I don't know how to do that.
I can sit on a panel and I can jam with
the best of them. I could do this and be
fine, but that's me riffing and ad
living.
&gt;&gt; You're asking me to do the news in front
of a camera with a teleprompter for
content that is not my content.
&gt;&gt; It's a real challenge." And they said,
"Well, that's Thank you for that
feedback. You you have two hours." And I
was like, I don't think this is a good
idea. I'm going to do a really bad job.

[26:00]
idea. I'm going to do a really bad job.
&gt;&gt; Now, did you have to do this? Did you
contractually?
&gt;&gt; Not nothing with them is contractual,
but I respect
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I respect the environment that I'm in
and and I want to be a good teammate.
And the lady said to me, "Oh, I totally
know it's going to suck. I'm okay with
it, and I'm in charge. And so, I want
you to go do it. and I also want you to
do it because I know you're
uncomfortable
&gt;&gt; and I know that you love challenges. So,
I did it and I went up to her office
after and I said, "How was that?" She's
like,
&gt;&gt; "Yeah, it was it was
&gt;&gt; as expected.
&gt;&gt; It was interesting." And I said, "I told
you." She's like, "I know." And I was
like, she said, "You're going to do it
again tomorrow." And I was like, "No,
but that person's back." She's like,
"You're going to do it again tomorrow."
I was like, "Honestly, I don't enjoy it.
&gt;&gt; I don't want to do it. please. She's
like, "You're going to do it again
tomorrow." And I did it again the next
day and it was a little better. And I
happened to be in New York this week
because I'm doing it all week, but now

[27:00]
because I'm doing it all week, but now
&gt;&gt; I want to do it
&gt;&gt; really.
&gt;&gt; And now I'm actually pretty good at it.
And now it's become like a drug because
I'm able to control a different kind of
environment. And I'm making the profit
of the fixer. It's a live set. It's
real. It's all happening, but it gets
edited down. So 5 days of filming turns
into 42 minutes. So 40 hours turns into
42 minutes,
&gt;&gt; right? I'm not controlling the editing.
When you're doing the news and it's
live, it's performance-based. Yeah. And
you have to you have to achieve a
certain thing. And so what I've started
to learn and maybe my message to
everybody is
&gt;&gt; if you want to be a good business
person,
&gt;&gt; you have to try things in and outside of
business that make you wildly
uncomfortable. and fish out of water is
the best curriculum for anything. And I
started to reflect on why I got involved
in all the different businesses on the
profit and why you get involved in all
these different businesses is because

[28:01]
these different businesses is because
it's almost like a challenge
&gt;&gt; to learn a different industry, to meet
different people, to not know the
answers to everything, to learn with
somebody, to learn how things work, and
to put it all together. When you're
making the news, you have to do all that
in one hour but live.
&gt;&gt; And when you're making a show or when
you're running a business or when you're
running a family or when you're doing
anything like that, you still have to do
all those things, but you have a chance
to reflect. I've noticed that my
reaction skills are getting better
because you're interviewing somebody and
you have to react. That's the message I
would send to business owners. Try
things that make you uncomfortable. try
different ventures that make you
uncomfortable. When I watch your videos,
which I'm really entertained by, by the
way.
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
&gt;&gt; I'm like, "Oh, I think that car wash
idea is good, but what if I what if I
did it at my RV dealerships and I wonder
what it would cost?" And then I watched
the one, and we were talking about it

[29:00]
the one, and we were talking about it
earlier. I watched the one that you did
about the gummy guy in Miami, and I was
like, I love gummies. Maybe I should do
that or maybe I should just be a good
customer.
And so I think that what you do and I
think what people don't appreciate
enough about you and maybe where you and
I are similar is we're both willing to
talk about things and try things and
some work and most don't.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. How much are you able to be
creative on set? Like how much of it is
it prepared like all right here's your
talking points versus you just like
riffing on the fixer or on the profit?
&gt;&gt; The fixer is on profit's 100% me.
There's no talking points. There's no
script. No producer research beforehand.
No, I do no research
&gt;&gt; really.
&gt;&gt; I know nothing.
&gt;&gt; That's awesome.
&gt;&gt; And it's intentional.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Part of it is I have a I have a learning
disability in one sense where if I know
too much information, I don't ask
questions. I'm like, I already know it.
And so what I learned early on in making
the show is if if I know nothing, I ask
all the questions that you're asking. So

[30:00]
all the questions that you're asking. So
I walk in the front door and whatever I
see, you see it, too. Yeah. And then I
ask him, you're like, "Yeah, that's a
totally good question." So, I started to
realize that what what worked about it
was the freedom to ask questions and the
freedom to do a follow-up question and
the freedom to make a decision. And I
want entrepreneurs to go into businesses
that they're interested in, that they
want to invest in, more curious than
knowledgeable. I've started to notice
that when I meet business owners today,
instead of being curious, they come too
prepared
&gt;&gt; and you can tell they're typing things
in a machine. Well, I know that 29% of
my market, nothing's more of a turnoff.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; For businesses who are doing their
research in AI exclusively.
&gt;&gt; Listen, Beehive has always been the best
newsletter platform for monetization.
Their ad network and their analytics are
unmatched. But they just had their
biggest update ever, and it's something
that all digital creators have to hear
about. It's not just newsletters

[31:00]
about. It's not just newsletters
anymore. They just dropped their own AI
website builder, dynamic podcast website
feature, native analytics, direct
digital product sales, and a link in bio
capability. And let me tell you, the
podcast website feature is outrageous. I
can pull my entire podcast directly into
my Beehive site and it automatically
creates episode pages with show notes,
an audio player, and embedded YouTube
videos. This replaces Pod Page and I've
already started messing around with
their digital products. Now you can sell
ebooks, courses, templates, whatever you
want directly to the people who are
already reading your stuff. So stop
paying for five different tools to do
all of this stuff that Beehive offers
within one platform. I've been using
Beehive for two years at this point, but
it's about time you got started. So,
switch over at beehive.com/chris
and use the code chris30 to get 30% off
your first three months. That's

Do you do a lot of research?

[32:00]
Do you do a lot of research?
&gt;&gt; I do. Yeah. But I feel like people don't
understand the trade-off they're making
when they rely on AI. They just feel
like it's all upside. They don't realize
there's a trade-off there. Right.
&gt;&gt; What if the information is wrong?
oftentimes it is
&gt;&gt; or it's slanted,
&gt;&gt; right? I'm not much of a planner or a
preparer. So, with this podcast, I don't
really do any prep. Like, I have all
these questions prepared. I haven't
looked down at it once. And I think that
makes for the best podcast because if I
were to do all this research beforehand,
then I'll ask questions for the sake of
asking questions and then feain surprise
when I hear the answer. But, like you
said, when you truly don't know anything
about it going in, it's more genuine and
you get better answers. So when you go
look at a business for the first time,
you go inprepared.
&gt;&gt; No, that wasn't really a strategy.
That's my ADHD and just being poor at
planning and last minute.
&gt;&gt; You're curious.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, very curious. I treat my episodes
as if I sat next to a business owner at
a dinner party and just was quizzing him
about his business. Right.

[33:00]
about his business. Right.
&gt;&gt; And then if it's interesting to you,
what happens next? I just ask them a
thousand questions and I get energy and
I get excited
&gt;&gt; or you get disturbed and bored depending
on their answers.
&gt;&gt; Well, I get bored if I sit down next to
a W2 worker just cuz I don't relate with
them and I'm an introvert so I I
naturally thrive on onetoone and with
other business owners.
&gt;&gt; Can you go to a party?
&gt;&gt; I don't. I I can. I don't prefer it.
&gt;&gt; Me neither.
&gt;&gt; Really
&gt;&gt; hate it.
&gt;&gt; I I felt like you were an extrovert.
&gt;&gt; Hate it.
&gt;&gt; You lose energy. No, I have social
anxiety. I suffer from debilitating
depression and anxiety.
&gt;&gt; And the reason that I work as much as I
do is because it medicates me.
&gt;&gt; It's like a soother for me. If I Sundays
are my least favorite day of the whole
week, I hate them
&gt;&gt; because I don't want to call people
&gt;&gt; because they're off with their family.
I don't know what to do.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And I love Monday because I'm ready to
like Monday I'm fired up. everybody's
and Sunday night I have to like wait

[34:01]
and Sunday night I have to like wait
till a certain time and I start firing
off emails. I've gotten better at it of
like sending them and like putting it
letting them go like in the morning, but
Sunday is a terrible day for me. Parties
are terrible for me. Relationships are
hard for me.
&gt;&gt; Very hard.
&gt;&gt; So, how do you deal with being on set
with all these people? Do you not get
social anxiety there?
&gt;&gt; No, because I'm there for work. I love
meeting new people. I love asking them
questions. I love to see how they can
shine. I like seeing the best out of
people. And I'll if I meet somebody on
the street or or even in the room like
this, I like asking questions because
I'm genuinely cur genuinely curious. But
I also think it's fun. I think people
are fun and I'm inspired by them. I
selfishly, if I'm being overly
transparent,
I want to learn something that I didn't
know before I met him. Mhm.
&gt;&gt; I just want to learn something. And so
if it's an audio guy or a cameraman who

[35:00]
if it's an audio guy or a cameraman who
I've never worked with before and most
of people have side hustles because the
work's not consistent,
&gt;&gt; I like just to know about them.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And then I'll start getting into their
business and asking them questions and
sometimes they answer, sometimes they
don't.
&gt;&gt; Would you say that if you had to choose,
are you an introvert or an extrovert? If
you had to choose,
&gt;&gt; I am a true introvert, but I can present
myself
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; as an extrovert.
But when I present myself as an
extrovert, as we get to know each other,
I will reveal myself who I really am and
share with them just like I just did
with you. I don't normally walk around
meeting people on the street and say, "I
suffer from terrible depression. How
about you?
&gt;&gt; Nice to meet you." But I want people to
know that if they are gonna have a
relationship with me and there's a day
where I'm off or there's a day that I'm
not engaged or there's a day where my
attitude is bad that it's not an excuse.
It's not an excuse and it's not a

[36:01]
It's not an excuse and it's not a
license to be that way, but it is it's
context.
&gt;&gt; It is what it is.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Sometimes I'll disappear for a week
&gt;&gt; from everyone.
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; Just to recharge. No, recharge sounds
like I I needed a vacation. It's to dig
myself out of a hole.
&gt;&gt; How often do you do that?
&gt;&gt; It happens less than it used to. I think
as an entrepreneur,
as a business owner, I have learned how
to self-medicate. And so, if I'm feeling
a certain way, I'll retreat to something
that I know is going to give me comfort.
It's happened a lot less since I got
married because
I really enjoy being with my wife. And
so if I'm feeling a certain way, I can
cocoon with her and she can dig me out
of it pretty quick. Like much quicker
than anybody can. But as a business
owner, I also know that I'm responsible
for people.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And that is usually what gets me out of
it pretty quick.
&gt;&gt; What do you do during that week?
&gt;&gt; I eat more than I should. I watch more

[37:01]
&gt;&gt; I eat more than I should. I watch more
TV than I should. My favorite thing
actually is if I'm feeling that way and
my wife goes out of town, I'm a neat
freak and a clean freak and my closet
like the hangers have a certain amount
of space between them for that week. All
hell breaks loose.
&gt;&gt; Nothing's safe.
&gt;&gt; Nothing. My own persona. Like I probably
don't shower for a couple days. I wear
the same clothes. My house looks like a
total wreck. I don't care. I eat food
that I know I shouldn't be eating. It's
like a guilty pleasure. And I could see
why other people, on a serious note, I
could see why other people fall into
other traps of addictions or things like
that because that's my form of
addiction. It's like I I can just I can
self soothe that way.
&gt;&gt; Mhm. Do you have ADHD?
&gt;&gt; I don't even know what that I mean, I
know what it means. I don't know. I
don't I know that I'm difficult to be
around. I know that I'm difficult to
work with. I know that I'm fun to be

[38:01]
work with. I know that I'm fun to be
with.
I know that I will do anything for you.
I know that I will ask you for nothing.
And I know that my intensity overwhelms
you.
&gt;&gt; So whatever that is,
&gt;&gt; you have
&gt;&gt; I have whatever that is. And you know,
we brought a bunch of people that have
known me for a long time. I would be
like escargo.
You either like them like it or you
don't. And it's an acquired taste. But
if you like it and you really like it,
you will love being with me.
&gt;&gt; You may roll your eyes as the person
listening to this who is with me all the
time saying, "I don't know that I love
being with you."
But you will like it because
uh there's lots of different sides of me
and the closer I feel to you in
business, the more I'll reveal. I think
it was uh Washington George Washington
Carver that said, "Anything will reveal
its secrets to you if you love it
enough."
And I love that quote. I think about it

[39:00]
And I love that quote. I think about it
a lot. Anything, not just a person, but
a thing, a business, an idea. I tend to
I tend to be far more revealing when I'm
in an environment that I'm comfortable
in. And business is the only environment
that I'm comfortable in. and making
television. I made an HG TV show one
year after making the profit and it was
the worst experience I ever had and I
thought that I just liked making
television
&gt;&gt; and I don't like making television. I
like making business television
&gt;&gt; and now I'm I like doing the business
news. It's got to be a subject that I'm
comfortable in, that I feel safe in. And
and that's what I would tell anybody
that feels like they don't know what to
do with their lives is business is a
safe place.
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; It's a really safe place.
&gt;&gt; One of my dreams is something that I
don't know that I would actually like if
I got there and that's to have a show
not like the profit but kind of like
Diners Drive-ins and Dives or Dirty Jobs

[40:00]
Diners Drive-ins and Dives or Dirty Jobs
where I just pick apart a business. I
help them with marketing. I help them
grow initiatives and just learn
everything about it, be curious about it
and like reveal it, right? I don't know
that I would actually like it if I did
that because I'm an introvert. Because I
don't want to I have four kids. I don't
want to be away from them all the time
just to satisfy some dream. What do you
think? Do you think based on the little
you know about me, do you think I would
like that or not?
&gt;&gt; I think you're looking at it the wrong
way because
you could do all the businesses in your
town and go home every night.
&gt;&gt; That would be the ideal scenario,
&gt;&gt; right? You could do that no problem.
Yeah. There's a couple things you have
to be able to do which I know you do
well. You have to be able to code
switch.
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; That is something that I would say you
cannot learn. And and for those people
that don't know what code switching is
is that you can move from topic to topic
for me because I'm involved in so many
different things. I could be talking
about the news at six and the
acquisition of Bed Bath and Beyond at

[41:00]
acquisition of Bed Bath and Beyond at
four and the divevestature of something
at three and a Family Reunion at two and
I'm making that up. Break those down
into minutes, not hours.
&gt;&gt; And you have to be able to move that
quick.
&gt;&gt; So that's one thing that you'd have to
do really well, which you do do well.
Um, are you willing to put yourself in a
situation
where you could fail publicly?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And are you willing to put yourself in a
situation where you could look dumb?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; That's different than failing.
&gt;&gt; It's interesting. I I'm more insecure
about the people on set looking at me
than I am about the pe the millions of
people that will be watching.
&gt;&gt; That'll go away. Okay.
&gt;&gt; It goes away like that. the idea of
making television and when when we start
a new episode with the new business, I
always tell them the first day, this is
going to be really weird for you. For
the first couple of hours, you're going
to see that camera and it's going to
feel like you have a microscope. Here's
what I would ask for my sake. I need us

[42:01]
what I would ask for my sake. I need us
to have a relationship, not you to have
a relationship with the camera.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; The people on the the guy that's
shooting it doesn't care and the camera
doesn't care. And the people that are
watching it, they don't care yet. And
the only way they're going to care is if
I get a 100% of you in me.
&gt;&gt; And I get to reveal everything about you
that they're going to love and
everything about you that they're not
going to love. But if you try to
regulate your behavior, and by the way,
I'm saying it to you, and I had to say
that to myself
&gt;&gt; before I started making it. If you try
to regulate your own behavior and have
too much self-awareness, you're gonna
have a problem. I'm going to share a
little inside baseball and he's going to
be really mad at me for this. I have a a
nice relationship with Alex Rodriguez. I
find him to be one of the smartest
people intellectually, really
misunderstood intellectually, but
unbelievably smart. He's a great
capitalist, but he's got a huge heart. I

[43:00]
capitalist, but he's got a huge heart. I
say that not as the preface to what I'm
about to tell you, but I genuinely feel
that way. When him and I first
re-engaged, he was he loved the prophet
and he's like, "I want to do that. I I
want to do that." And I said to him,
"Okay, but why?" He goes, "Cuz I love
what you do and I I want to do that,
too." And I was like, "Okay, great.
Let's do it."
And what I said to him was, Alex,
the challenge is, I don't care what
people think of me on the surface. I do
deep down. We all do deep down. You care
what people think of you.
&gt;&gt; And people have tried to rip you down.
And whether it was, you know, the good,
the bad. He's got a new doc a
documentary on HBO which is really good.
&gt;&gt; You have to be able willing to reveal
yourself in a way. And it can't always
be, does my hair look good? Does my suit
look good? He's a super handsome dude,
dresses amazing. Do I have the answer to
every question? Am I ever going to make
the right decision? What are they going
to think about me? Do I have to prove

[44:01]
to think about me? Do I have to prove
this? Do I have to prove that? If you do
that, he made a show at CNBC a few years
ago, and I did one episode with him just
to try to help him understand how it
would work. And he is so charismatic and
so smart, but he struggled initially. He
doesn't struggle with this anymore, but
he struggled initially coming off of
people just beating on him for whatever
reason they did. And I'm I'm he's my
friend, so it doesn't matter what he
did. I love him no matter what. But he
struggled to be to not have
self-awareness.
Whether you are a business owner, not on
TV,
a newscaster,
a public speaker, or you want to be on
TV, if you regulate your behavior and
you have a high level of self-awareness,
worried about what the people on set
think of you, it the whole idea would be
dead on arrival. It'd be totally dead on
arrival. And the best thing that I would
tell him is like, just make fun of
yourself.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Just make fun of yourself. It's so much
easier because if you make fun of

[45:00]
easier because if you make fun of
yourself, everybody's like everybody's
like expectations get lowered in a good
way.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You're like, "God, I am really bad at
this. I don't think we should do this."
People like, "No, you'll be fine." It's
like, "No, I'm honestly I'm not good."
People will help you
&gt;&gt; and they will forgive you when you fudge
it up.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, that's my message to you. If you
really want to do it, you can only do it
if you have zero zero selfpolicing.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, I did this one YouTube video
where I went around a grocery store and
asked the manager for help if we could
give away puppies. And I was so
concerned about what the people in the
grocery store thought about the guy that
had the camera on him. I didn't care
about the cameraman or the viewers, but
I just felt weird for everyone in the
store to be looking at me, you know?
&gt;&gt; Why is that?
&gt;&gt; I don't know. I I don't like to be on
the spot. I know that seems weird. I get
100 million views a month on my content,
but in person, I don't like the
spotlight to be on me.
&gt;&gt; Well, I'm going to give it to you a
different way.
You don't have a choice.
You were given a gift. And this applies

[46:01]
You were given a gift. And this applies
to anybody out there. Whatever gift you
were given, you have an obligation to
use it. And whatever issues you have,
whatever anxiety you need to overcome,
that's your garbage. And if you have the
ability to change the outcome of
somebody else where they're going to
learn something, they're going to get
information or they're going to be
inspired, you have an obligation to do
that. It would be like a really good
athlete not doing something or a really
good scientist not launching rockets or
a really good musician not singing. You
were given a gift and you have an
obligation to share it. And your gift is
being able to communicate to people your
ideas cris crisply and cleanly and in a
way that they can digest to better
themselves.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Isn't that right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, it's not about you feeling
uncomfortable at the grocery store. No
one cares.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; No one cares that you're uncomfortable.
Get over it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Because what you're giving people is

[47:01]
&gt;&gt; Because what you're giving people is
more valuable than the uncomfortableness
you're feeling. And maybe you should
flip the script and go in and say,"I
know I'm good at this and I'm going to
have fun and I'm going to make fun of
myself and I'm going to laugh with the
people in the grocery store and I'm
going to say to them, you guys probably
think this is the craziest thing ever.
You just came here to buy toilet paper
and I'm talking a bunch of
you have fun with it. You'll be okay.
But if you're not okay with it, too
bad."
&gt;&gt; Like I run ultramarathons. That's
uncomfortable. And I do that because
it's uncomfortable. I don't like
running. I just need to frame it.
getting anything out of that but you.
&gt;&gt; Right. I'm just saying if I framed it
that way like
&gt;&gt; it's not the same.
&gt;&gt; Well, I'm saying Chris, do this because
it's uncomfortable and because you have
an obligation.
&gt;&gt; Those are different. Run the marathon
because it's fish out of water
uncomfortable. Make the content in the
middle of the grocery store because you
were given a gift that you have an
obligation to display to people. Too
bad.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, you don't think I should ever
say, you know what, I'm just going to
make stuff in my office at home. You

[48:01]
make stuff in my office at home. You
think it's I have an obligation to go
out there and make better content about
business because it's already proven
that people are inspired by it, so I
need to lean into that more.
&gt;&gt; What if you change somebody's life?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And I promise you that whoever's
watching it has more anxiety than you
do. And whoever's in the grocery store
has more fears than you do. I don't
think you have a right to choose.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I
&gt;&gt; think you've lost that right.
&gt;&gt; There was this one comment on a YouTube
video where I went door todoor selling
things and he was like, "Chris, I had no
idea how bad you are at sales. how bad
you are at small talk and it's so
refreshing. Like that is awesome. I feel
so much more confident seeing that
you're not good at sales and I took that
to be a compliment. I was grateful for
that.
&gt;&gt; You exposed your vulnerabilities and you
gave people permission to feel okay with
themselves.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's more relatable.
&gt;&gt; That's what the that's why the profit
work to be honest is because we would
make the math really simple. That was
always a big thing of mine. Dumb it all
the way down. Do the work with people so
that they understand that you're
invested in them. And don't be the

[49:01]
invested in them. And don't be the
smartest guy in the room all the time
because you can't be.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Be relatable.
&gt;&gt; You were talking about code switching. I
tweeted this 12 hours ago. I'm going to
read this. Here's a secret the
productivity gurus don't want you to
know. The more you context switch, the
more you get used to context switching
and the faster you can context switch
without skipping a beat. Our minds
adapt. Context switching should be all
or nothing. For me, it's all
&gt;&gt; it's difficult to to code switch,
context switch without having remnants
of the previous conversation leak into
the current one. It's it's difficult. I
would think about it like a reverse
paper boy. A paper boy rides on his bike
and he disseminates information by
throwing it into the yard. And what I do
and what you do is that I drive around
on my bike and I pick information up.
&gt;&gt; Mhm. and I put it in my basket and I
have to figure out how to sort it and I
have to figure out how to use it and I
have to figure out how to disseminate it

[50:01]
have to figure out how to disseminate it
again.
In every single instance, the more I do
it, the more houses I want to go pick up
information because I want the
information that I give people to be
more relevant, more current and or
accurate. I think that code switching
and the reason I am so invigorated by it
is because I can move from topic to
topic but there's a common thread
through all of those and that's the
interaction with people and I get a lot
of practice at dealing with multiple
personalities in a short period of time
with different levels of emotion
&gt;&gt; all that I have to process and give back
something and more importantly
I have to be a chameleon. So, not only
do I have to take all of their stuff,
but I have to give them something back.
And I have to give them something back
that's going to work for them. I think
that ultimately
people who struggle with relationships

[51:00]
people who struggle with relationships
tend to keep themselves cocooned long
term. people that tend tend to really
grow and have new ideas and get better
at their frailties and get better at
their gaps are because they're
interacting with so many things so
often. And the fact that you do that, I
think makes you a jack of all trades.
The question is, are you a master of
anything?
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; That's a question. You're a jack of all
trades. Are you a master of anything?
&gt;&gt; I'm a master of bias for action, of
having ideas, being curious, and
executing on it immediately. And the
more I do that, the more I do that, the
better I get at it. Being impulsive in a
constructive good way or impulsive.
&gt;&gt; How much time will it take you to meet
somebody and make a decision whether you
want to do it?
&gt;&gt; Five minutes.
&gt;&gt; And how quickly will you act on it?
&gt;&gt; Five more minutes. My interviews with
employees are I know within 5 to 10
minutes, but I'm willing to cut bait
within 30 days if it doesn't work. I
don't do like multiple rounds of

[52:00]
don't do like multiple rounds of
interviews, multiple hours. I would
rather just make a quick decision.
&gt;&gt; I feel like you and I are related.
&gt;&gt; When they stay, do they stay for a long
time?
&gt;&gt; It's either all or nothing. It's either
13 days or 13 years.
&gt;&gt; Is there any part of you that that
thinks that's a problem?
&gt;&gt; I used to. Part of it is just like, am I
just giving into who I am? Am I just
settling? Or is it this is actually a
feature, not a bug? I need to just lean
into this. I I went and got my NBA
because I thought I was too distracted.
If I could go back in time, I wouldn't
have done that again.
&gt;&gt; Wasted time
&gt;&gt; and money. I've never used my under.
&gt;&gt; You need it for stature?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, probably. It's probably an
insecurity, but I I wanted to be more
organizational and less shoot from the
hip.
&gt;&gt; Were you good in school?
&gt;&gt; I was okay. Just okay.
&gt;&gt; A minus.
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; that's just okay. A minus. Just okay.
&gt;&gt; I don't know.
&gt;&gt; Nobody likes to show off.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I No, I I wasn't like
validictorian type. didn't I didn't
apply myself like when I got to

[53:01]
apply myself like when I got to
undergrad I had a computer in front of
me and I'm like what why am I supposed
to be listening about mitochondria when
I can like research business ideas so I
completely didn't focus or study or
anything I did just the bare minimum to
get by
&gt;&gt; in your yearbook most likely it would
have written most likely to
&gt;&gt; I was nothing different or special in
high school
&gt;&gt; what would it have said
&gt;&gt; class clown most likely to be a comedian
I served a mission for my church I
knocked doors for two years in Hungary.
&gt;&gt; LDS.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And that changed my life more than
anything. I came home. What's that?
&gt;&gt; What did you learn?
&gt;&gt; I learned rejection is a good thing. I
got rejected. I I counted loosely like
25,000 times face to face at the door.
That changes you. So I came home with
confidence. I came home and I was like,
"This is America." Like I didn't My dad
used to cry during the Star Spangle
Banner and I'd be like, "Dad, what are
you doing? Get a hold of yourself." And
then I went in Eastern Europe for 2
years and just spoke to people all day
every day and I came home and I'm like I

[54:00]
every day and I came home and I'm like I
can do whatever I want. This is the
greatest country. And so it gave me
confidence and I've just I haven't
stopped since. Had I not gone on a
mission, I'd be doing nothing special
today. I truly believe that.
&gt;&gt; How do people that are not a part of
that faith get that same experience?
&gt;&gt; That's a great question. I wish I could
just tell someone go to Eastern Europe,
learn Hungarian, knock doors for two
years. That's all you need to do. That's
not realistic. I think maybe it's cold
calling sales in general.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, cuz we don't have enough
resilience or grit today. And that's my
superpower. I do have grit. Like I won't
quit. I'm scrappy. And it's because of
that. I don't know how someone develops
that without just exposure therapy
getting rejected.
&gt;&gt; When you knocked on, you said $25,000
&gt;&gt; something like that. When one would go
well, you'd have whatever your
definition of success was. What was the
feeling?
&gt;&gt; I would dance the whole way home. I'd
forget about all the losses. It was the

[55:01]
forget about all the losses. It was the
best.
&gt;&gt; Do you apply that to relationships, too?
&gt;&gt; How so?
&gt;&gt; You have every relationship you've ever
had has worked out. Every friendship?
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; So, isn't it the same?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Similar. I have a handful of
people that I'm incredibly close with
and loyal to. and then everyone else.
&gt;&gt; You do business with any of them?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; How does that work?
&gt;&gt; Not great a lot of times.
&gt;&gt; Not great.
&gt;&gt; I've had about 15 business partners.
Some of them my best friends, family
members.
&gt;&gt; Not great.
&gt;&gt; No. I had to find the common denominator
after a while. And it's like,
statistically speaking, Chris, you're
you might be the problem here. How do
you structure partnerships?
With as much distance as I can because I
got burned too many times. I had a
really good friend that I did business
with and we had a falling out and our
friendship is very different today and I
as I've gotten older I've tried to think
about resuscitating that. I tend to
unfortunately not be great at forgiving

[56:03]
unfortunately not be great at forgiving
people. It's a terrible quality of mine.
Like once we're done, we're kind of
done. I try not to do business with
people that I have relationships with,
but I have a very difficult time saying
no to people.
&gt;&gt; Same.
&gt;&gt; And so people will ask for things and
I'll do it for them. And I've just
repositioned my brain to say, "Okay,
okay." It's just like it it's gone. My
relationship changes with them though
once they ask me for something because
then I'm always anticipating that
there's going to be the next round. It
it definitely changes. How has your
relationship with business changed since
being married, if at all?
&gt;&gt; I take less chances.
My wife's considerably older than I am,
and so more than likely, you know, if
natural causes sort of bring us to our
death, she'll she'll won't live as long.
I feel responsible for her. And when I

[57:00]
I feel responsible for her. And when I
wasn't married, I didn't feel
responsible. I was like, if I lose
everything, I'll go sell cars and I'm
more than happy. This is like I promise
you I would be much happier in a studio
apartment. Just like I even have this
visual first apartment that I ever lived
in out of college. This is a studio
apartment overlooking a tennis court. I
had furniture that was like cardboard.
But I was so happy. It was maybe the
happiest time of my life cuz it was like
my life was simple. And if you told me
you're going to have to go back and live
that life, I'd be like, "Don't threaten
me with a good time."
&gt;&gt; I'd be totally happy. Keep my checkbook
with me.
&gt;&gt; Like, you would see it on the show.
There's my real checkbook. Like, I kept
it in my pocket or in my in my bag.
&gt;&gt; I have no checkbook and no access to
capital today. I legitimately do not
have a checkbook. I can't wire money on
my own. And my wife didn't take it from
me. I gave it to her and I just said
like,
&gt;&gt; "I need to be protected."
&gt;&gt; Yeah. from myself.
&gt;&gt; Is that a relief?
&gt;&gt; It's a relief because I could say to

[58:01]
&gt;&gt; It's a relief because I could say to
people like, "I would love to, but you
have to call her." They're like, "I'm
not calling her." I'm like,
&gt;&gt; "I can't help you."
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Is there any part about your life
that you thought would change when you
got married that didn't?
&gt;&gt; There's a part of my life that still
needs to change that hasn't changed yet,
and that is because business is a safe
place for me. I've convinced myself it's
the only place. It needs to be more than
that. You know, growing up, I most
people don't know this about me, but in
high school, I went to a a Catholic
elementary and a Catholic high school,
and I was going to become a priest. And
I was really really heavily into my
faith. And I went to college, I went to
a Jesuit college, and the order of
priests that that ran the college kind
of disenfranchised me from my faith. The
part that I thought would change when I
got married was that I thought that I
would kind of reemerge with my faith
again. I have to a small degree, but not
the way I want to.
&gt;&gt; And I thought that make more time or

[59:01]
&gt;&gt; And I thought that make more time or
spend less time on business
and I need to do a better job just as a
human finding the balance. I'm so
fascinated by work and I'm so I have to
be honest, it's probably I'm addicted to
it in a not healthy way,
&gt;&gt; but I don't but I'm not hurting anybody
by it, including myself, I don't think,
but I'd like to maybe care a little
less.
&gt;&gt; Do you have any regrets?
&gt;&gt; I have regrets not having kids. It was a
choice that I made. When you're a
business owner, you're the first person
to show up in the morning. You're the
last person to leave. your credit cards
are maxed out. You're the last person to
get paid. You miss out on family
functions. You make bad choices in terms
of like your friend group in being there
for them, your family and being present
for them. You make bad choices. I think
the bad choice that I made is I made a
conscious decision that being a business
person was more important to me than

[1:00:00]
person was more important to me than
being a parent. And I convinced myself
that I would get whatever fulfillment
that I wanted to get out of being a
parent, I would get that out of being in
business. and I would have this parental
relationship with people at work and to
some degree it's happened. I get that
same fulfillment. I don't know if it's
the same because I don't have context to
know
&gt;&gt; but I would say yeah I kind of I would
have liked to be responsible
actually responsible for people
&gt;&gt; as opposed to like being at work. I'm
actually responsible for them but
sometimes I'm like you got to show up.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I know with my kid I be you're
going to show up and this is how it's
going to be. So that I would say that's
a regret. That's a regret. I would say
another regret would be I'm not sure if
I had to do it again. I would do TV.
&gt;&gt; H why?
&gt;&gt; Because I thought it was going to change
my life in a way that that at I've been
doing this since I was 30.
Oh my gosh. I've been doing this since I

[1:01:01]
Oh my gosh. I've been doing this since I
was 35. I'm 51. And I've been doing TV
for that long. And when you're 35, you
kind of romanticize the idea of like
what it's going to be like. It's going
to be super glamorous and you you're
going to get a dinner reservation and
all those things that you kind of
&gt;&gt; make up in your mind. It stole a good
chunk of my life. It stole a lot of my
time. Yeah. I was spending a lot of time
doing it and I was spending a lot of
time investing in and I was spending a
lot of time being labeled by it and I
enjoyed the things that came with it and
I'm grateful for the platform and for
all of those things but it came with
like you know it came with some not so
good things.
&gt;&gt; How do you think you would have spent
your time otherwise if you weren't doing
TV but still doing business?
&gt;&gt; I probably would have become a parent.
&gt;&gt; You still could. You're you're adopted,
right?
&gt;&gt; I'm adopted. Um,
&gt;&gt; my wife's adopted,
&gt;&gt; but I'm a firm believer, just maybe it's
a faith-based thing, but I'm a firm
believer that if you're going to be a

[1:02:00]
believer that if you're going to be a
parent, you have to be a parent.
&gt;&gt; You can't be a part-time parent. And I
understand that sometimes people have to
make tough choices to be a part-time
parent because they have to provide for
their family and they have to work two
and three jobs. And that's not a choice,
that's a requirement because they're
responsible for their family. And I
admire those people greatly. they end up
being the biggest loser in that model
because they get nothing for themselves.
But if I was going to be a parent, I
would know that I would have to change
my life. And candidly, I wasn't willing
to do it. I wasn't willing to give up
the drug of business for whatever
potential satisfaction that would come
from being a parent. I look back on that
now, I was like, I was 35, 36, 37, and
even at 51, my life's pretty baked. And
people have said to me, "Well, you could
just like you could just not work and
just do that." I was like, "I could, but
then I would be unhappy and then if I
was unhappy, would I resent my child?"
Because that was the reason that I made
the modification. So when those things
start to populate through your head, and

[1:03:01]
start to populate through your head, and
maybe all parents think that, I don't
know. Um, but the fact that that even
comes into my head makes me say like, I
don't want my child to have stuff.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, I know we're both Christian.
We don't share the same faith. Exactly.
But in our faith, we believe that
families are eternal. And I have
confidence that when it's all said and
done, you won't have that regret. Like
you'll have an opportunity to have a
family, to have kids when it's all said
and done. Yeah. The next life included.
So
&gt;&gt; yeah, I like that. I think that's I
think that's right. I actually I don't
think we're as far off in in thinking
about that um as you may think, but I
love the people I work with to my core.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And you know, I've been making
some life decisions about what I want to
do career-wise. I took over another
fractured business and the business of
my camping business. It's been 25 years.
I don't want to be defined by it, nor do

[1:04:00]
I don't want to be defined by it, nor do
I want it to be defined by me. And the
young people that are in that business
today are infinitely smarter than I will
ever be, infinitely more talented and
more skilled than I will ever be. And
the one thing that I could take pride in
is maybe I help them get there. Every
business needs an evolution
and I spend a lot more time thinking
about succession planning and I feel
like the team that's in place there is
right. biggest challenge for me is do
you partially make that modification or
do you have to make like a clean break?
&gt;&gt; And that's been, you know, people have
said, well, if you don't want to be the
CEO anymore, then just be on the board.
And I don't know that I could ever kind
of like be half half there.
&gt;&gt; No half measures.
&gt;&gt; Nor do I think it's good for them, nor
is it good for me. I think you have to
like
&gt;&gt; all or nothing.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think so. And I I've been I've
been wrestling with that in lots of
parts of my life. Like it's just an all
or nothing. And while it seems severe,

[1:05:01]
or nothing. And while it seems severe,
it seems maybe my philosophy on this
topic will help you help everybody. But
the business is always more important
than the business owner.
Infinitely more important. People say,
well, were you successful in that
business or did you make money? A
person's success in a business is not
defined by the success that happens
while they're there. It's defined by the
success in my mind of what happens when
they're not there, when they leave. Did
they lay the foundation right? Did they
put the right people in place? Did the
culture get established the right way?
And if the business falls apart when you
leave, then the business actually wasn't
good while you were there.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. You've also said that the employee
is more important than the customer. way
more,
&gt;&gt; which is something I've always said, if
you treat your employees right, they'll
treat your customers right.
&gt;&gt; Just as long as the employees don't
misunderstand that the customer doesn't
matter. And I've had some knuckleheads
say, "Well, you said I was more
important." I was like, "I get it, but

[1:06:01]
important." I was like, "I get it, but
that's how we eat." Yeah. So, like this
idea that the employee is more important
to me than the customer doesn't mean
that the customer is not important.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But you're the one that had interacts
with the customer. So, like I still need
you to make them the most important
thing. Like don't take my words and
think you could apply that to your job.
That's just for me. You have to make
them the most important thing.
&gt;&gt; I want to be respectful of your time. I
could talk all day. I know you have
things.
&gt;&gt; Two questions. Number one, for aspiring
entrepreneurs watching this, they have
analysis paralysis. They're thinking,
they're dabbling. They're watching
content.
&gt;&gt; They're AIing at Chad P, but they're not
doing the thing. What advice would you
give them?
&gt;&gt; Pick one thing and go do it. and uh be
calculated about what you're going to do
because there's a high risk you're going
to lose lose. It's not a game. It's real
life and you can't put your family or
yourself in peril. If you're just
starting out, have the risk be measured.

[1:07:02]
starting out, have the risk be measured.
I think that taking a chance on yourself
is the one regret I will never have. And
that's the run one regret that I don't
want anybody else to have. But it has to
be calculated and it has to be finite.
And if you've never done it before, you
can't take your 401k and put a second
mortgage on your house. No matter what
movie you saw or what speaker you
listened to or what book you read that
said lay it all on the line, don't do
that.
&gt;&gt; You don't have to.
&gt;&gt; But don't but don't do it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Don't do it. Learn in baby steps. And
when we all learned how to ride a bike,
our parent parents put training wheels
on our bike because they knew we would
fall down. If you're going to be an
entrepreneur, start with something super
basic.
&gt;&gt; Don't be an investor in somebody else's
business as your first like I'm getting
into business. The lemonade stand or
whatever the equivalent is of a lemonade
stand is should go down as the best

[1:08:01]
stand is should go down as the best
first business ever.
My lemonade stand was the candy
business. I started a little candy
business. It's a crazy story how I got
there.
&gt;&gt; I thought you didn't start a business
though. Did you start it?
&gt;&gt; I mean, I was hawking other people's
wares.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; 7-Eleven was a great wholesale account
for me. Um, what I want people to do is
just take a chance, but no going allin,
none of that. And the thing that I like
about what you do, maybe more than maybe
more than anything you do, is that you
provide people these little ideas
that are lowrisk potential return,
&gt;&gt; but they're low risk and they feel like
some of them could be side hustles. So,
if you want to start a business, I want
you to start with something like that
because you still need to make income
&gt;&gt; to feed your family and pay your
mortgage and pay your tuition and take
care of your kids or whatever it may be.
But as you do that side hustle and then

[1:09:00]
But as you do that side hustle and then
you get to two side hustles and three
side hustles and you get enough cash
flow to do that, then you can make the
leap once the cash flow is right. But
don't put your family at risk.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I call it the wing walkers code.
You got an airplane wing walker. Never
let go of one railing until you're
already holding on to the next.
&gt;&gt; And that other one better be solid.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. My next question, my last
question. What business ideas do you
have right now that you're excited
about? What's your business idea of the
week or of the day? My business idea of
the next 10 years of my life that
happens to be today, this week, and this
month is I got involved in a very
bizarre way with a company based in Salt
Lake City uh where I kind of kicked down
the side door and got onto the board and
took over the company in a month and it
was Overstock, now known as Bed Bath and
Beyond. We bought bye-bye baby and the
American dream which I feel like has
lost its way is starts and ends with

[1:10:00]
lost its way is starts and ends with
home ownership.
&gt;&gt; Agreed 100%.
&gt;&gt; And home ownership has become a real
problem and it's not a political thing.
Oh, this person, that person, 50-year
mortgages, like I don't want to hear any
of it. It's a goal and we have to figure
out a way to get there. And it's still
possible. You can you can save a
paycheck and get a down payment and you
can buy a house and it may be a further
drive than you want, but you can find
affordable housing somewhere. It exists.
I don't I don't want to hear that it
doesn't. I don't I don't believe that to
be true.
&gt;&gt; I want to have the last part of my
career, the first part of my career has
been mobile housing and recreational
housing. And I want the last part of my
career to be foundational housing and
family housing and generational wealth
building. And people thought that I got
involved with Bed Bath and Beyond
because I wanted to sell towels and
bedding and you know t you know stuff
for your kitchen. That isn't the reason.
And I want to use that as a platform to
build an everything home business where
we can provide uh services and products,

[1:11:02]
we can provide uh services and products,
fintech, insurance, home buying, home
selling, home insurance, home finance,
home decorating, lawn, all those things
in one because they think home
ownership's an expensive proposition and
it's a scary proposition. And I want to
try to figure out a way to make it less
intimidating for people. And I want to
do it on blockchain.
&gt;&gt; Wow. Okay.
&gt;&gt; So, we own a big uh blockchain business
today that most people don't know about.
And ideally, in the end, a home would go
on chain, go on blockchain. And for
those people that don't know what it is,
just think about it like a lock box
where all of the information gets
stored. So, if you have a safe in your
house with a code and you put all your
important papers in there, you would
essentially build them into a technology
stack and you would access them all. So,
ideally, I'd like every home in America
to be on chain with title deed, survey,
mortgage, insurance, all your assets and
everything else. So, if there's a

[1:12:00]
everything else. So, if there's a
Pacific Palisades fire, you haven't lost
anything.
&gt;&gt; If you pass away unexpectedly, you
haven't lost everything. If you want to
sell your asset, the value of your asset
will be appreciated because it will have
all of that information. When you go to
sell your car, they say, "Do you have
the maintenance records?" Nobody does.
If you go to sell your home and you have
all of that in one place and people know
what it looks like and they understand
it all and they see every permit and
everything that ever happened to the
home, the transferability of that
&gt;&gt; will make financing that asset more
interesting
&gt;&gt; because conventional financing can't
live forever. So, I want to change the
way people think about home ownership
and I want to change this idea that home
ownership isn't obtainable. But I like I
like the home. And maybe maybe because I
came into this world as an orphan and
I'm going to leave this world as an
orphan. Both my parents are gone and I
have no siblings and no real family.
That home that roof idea,

[1:13:01]
That home that roof idea,
that dwelling idea, that memory idea,
that life event idea, birthdays,
anniversaries,
child births, funerals, marriages, all
that stuff. It's really a summary of
someone's whole life. I want to help
make that a little bit more digestible
for people. It's a super ambitious idea,
but why not try?
&gt;&gt; I love it. Ethereum, that blockchain.
&gt;&gt; Um, I don't know yet.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; I don't know yet.
&gt;&gt; People will help me figure that out.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's a great idea.
&gt;&gt; I want to be able to tokenize things and
that's what I ultimately love is the
tokenization. And we we own a business
called T0 that
&gt;&gt; I know TZ. I was an investor in the
original TZ ICO
&gt;&gt; back in Salt Lake
&gt;&gt; uh
&gt;&gt; with Patrick Burn.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, like back in 2019
&gt;&gt; or so.
&gt;&gt; T0 R O you bought a little bit of a
token.
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; I think so. Yeah,
&gt;&gt; that business is going to sell for a lot
of money someday. It's a crazy world
that we're living in. And whether it's

[1:14:02]
that we're living in. And whether it's
AI, crypto, blockchain,
tokenization,
it reminds me of 20 years ago, plasma
screen, and iPod.
For those young people that listen, I
don't know if you know what an iPod is,
but it's like a small part of the iPhone
where the music used to live.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So,
&gt;&gt; Marcus, thank you.
&gt;&gt; Thanks for the chat. I have a question
for you before we go. You love making
content and you love sharing your
business ideas with people,
but there's got to be a purpose behind
it. What's the purpose?
&gt;&gt; What's the end goal?
&gt;&gt; No. What is your purpose here?
&gt;&gt; Aside from family stuff,
&gt;&gt; it could be that. Not aside from
anything. What is your purpose?
&gt;&gt; I want to be a loyal, loving husband and
father and disciple of Christ first and
foremost.
After that, I want to inspire a million

[1:15:00]
After that, I want to inspire a million
business owners. I want to inspire a
million people to start a business with
my content, with my work.
&gt;&gt; Why? Because business and
entrepreneurship has given me
everything. I grew up poor, lower middle
class, no money for food, cans of
vegetables in the in the cabinets, and I
just didn't like it. And
entrepreneurship gave me everything. And
it's my biggest joy. Like you, it gives
me energy and I want everyone to see if
they like it. It's not for everyone,
right? Business ownership. But I want
everyone that's curious, that wants to
try it, wants to taste business
ownership. I want to help them get there
so at least they can answer that
question for themselves.
&gt;&gt; What are they going to get from it?
&gt;&gt; They won't have a regret about it.
&gt;&gt; Freedom.
&gt;&gt; Potentially one less regret, right? We
we're more likely to regret things we
didn't do than things that we did.
&gt;&gt; Business ownership is not freedom. It's
the opposite of freedom.
&gt;&gt; Right. But it's optionality.

[1:16:00]
&gt;&gt; Right. But it's optionality.
&gt;&gt; But it's a pathway to being able to
solve things for yourself.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, having regrets is not
freedom either, right? Freedom of the
mind.
&gt;&gt; So if if someone I just talked to a lot
of people in their 40s, 50s, 60s like,
"Yeah, I I started to do this. if I want
and I never and I can just see they're
not saying it outright but I can just
hear and see the regret on their face
&gt;&gt; and I don't like that. I want them to at
least know. There's been businesses that
I've thought about starting. I was
curious and I started it and it went
terribly and then I moved on and I'm
like I I tried it. I did that. I don't
regret anything. And I just want people
to have that experience for
entrepreneurship in general. for people
that are listening that don't share our
faith or don't share or have a belief in
whatever it is and I'm fine with that.
The one thing that I always tell people
is I need you to have a belief and faith
in something
&gt;&gt; even if it's just yourself.
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; You have to have it and it starts from
there. I think too often people either

[1:17:01]
there. I think too often people either
&gt;&gt; don't believe in a higher power which is
their choice
&gt;&gt; but more importantly don't believe in
themselves. Mhm.
&gt;&gt; And if you don't believe in yourself,
don't get in business.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Period.
&gt;&gt; That's a good point.
&gt;&gt; You will fail.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Cuz it's going to be hard.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; 100%. And the likelihood of it working
out is very low.
&gt;&gt; Full disclosure. It's like the warning
on the side of a cigarettes.
&gt;&gt; Getting into business can may cause
harm.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; This is what could happen.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; All right, buddy. Thank you, Marcus.
Appreciate it.
