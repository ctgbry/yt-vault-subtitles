[00:00]
All right. So, until this video came
out, nobody knew about this hack. This
is a Costco. There's about 900 of them
on this Big [music] Blue Earth, and
people are making between 2,000 and
$20,000 profit every week buying gold
bars from Costco and selling them on the
internet. You've got to know which cards
to use, which hacks to use, how to get
the right points, how to convert them.
We're going to cover all that in this
video so [music] you can profit.
All
right. So, there are about 14 Costos in
the Dallas Fort Worth Metroplex, and we
want to see if any of them have any
gold. So, I'm going to call one in
Plano, which isn't too far from where I
live, and I want to find out how much
are they're selling it for, what the
quantity is, but most importantly, do
they even have it in stock? So,
&gt;&gt; Costco Island,
&gt;&gt; hey, do you have any um gold in stock
right now?
&gt;&gt; Yes, we do. I'm sorry. I meant to say
Costco. What is the price of it and how
many do you have in stock right now?
&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, I'm not allowed to get
the price over the phone.
&gt;&gt; Okay. What about like stock quantity?

[01:01]
&gt;&gt; Okay. What about like stock quantity?
&gt;&gt; Let me take a look. 24 of them. We have
plenty.
&gt;&gt; All right. Thanks. I'll be stopping by.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Goodbye.
&gt;&gt; All right. Bye. Let's go buy some gold.
&gt;&gt; If you want to buy five bars, you just
need a disguise every time. You need
five disguises in the car. Hello.
&gt;&gt; How y'all doing?
&gt;&gt; Good. Good.
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Yep. There she is. The white whale. Good
luck, dragon. So, it's not the Lady
Fortuna.
&gt;&gt; No. So, they have different ones.
&gt;&gt; Have you bought that one before?
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. They come with like a nice little
uh carrier in the case.
&gt;&gt; Okay. How's that price
&gt;&gt; right now? I think it's uh just a little
bit above the spot, so
&gt;&gt; a good It's a good price.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's been repriced since
yesterday, for sure.
&gt;&gt; Can I get a bar gold?
&gt;&gt; Of course.
&gt;&gt; What was it priced yesterday?
&gt;&gt; Oh, we didn't have it yesterday. It just
showed up to date, but whenever they
first put it up here, uh, it was going
to be $100 more, but but then they wait
for like the market to stop.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Hasn't been this one in a long time. We
have double dragons right now. Another

[02:00]
have double dragons right now. Another
lady bought 10. You know what I mean?
Like
&gt;&gt; 10.
&gt;&gt; Well, as long as you have two different
memberships.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Do you get a lot of people buying
these?
&gt;&gt; Hell yeah. They sold out within the hour
last week.
&gt;&gt; Wow.
&gt;&gt; So, but this week looks to be you're
like the second person for some reason.
&gt;&gt; Usually when it goes up, it should stop,
but it was the opposite.
And people aren't buying.
&gt;&gt; Do you usually get them on Wednesdays?
&gt;&gt; Been kind of Wednesdays. I say call
Wednesday morning. If not Wednesday
morning, call
&gt;&gt; Wednesday noon and like first come first
serve.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But it's kind of strange this week. It
was the complete opposite last week. If
it like by this point last week, it
would you would might be the one being
the last one.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; When it gets expensive, everyone wants
to buy it. When it gets cheap,
everyone's scared.
&gt;&gt; It's weird.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Human nature. I bought it a week ago and
it was $40 more on the on the silver,
but I don't care. Like,
&gt;&gt; yeah,
&gt;&gt; it's a couple dollars here and there,
but you're buying the big boy stuff. I
wouldn't mind having a little bit of
that. Already have some already or
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Good.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; There you go, man.
&gt;&gt; I like it.
&gt;&gt; Keep it and just look at that for a
moment. Oh, that's awesome. And then put

[03:00]
moment. Oh, that's awesome. And then put
it away.
&gt;&gt; Oh, what was that?
&gt;&gt; Do Do people buy it just to flip it or
do they buy it and hold it?
&gt;&gt; A little bit of everything. Um, a lot of
people buy them to actually make
jewelry.
&gt;&gt; Oh, interesting.
&gt;&gt; A lot of that. Um and um a lot of people
are holding too and a lot of people
don't even tell us what they're doing.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But I surprised that quite a bit are
using it to send to uh overseas and have
their jewelry manufactured.
&gt;&gt; Interesting.
&gt;&gt; Surprising.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Cuz I would think if someone comes
back and buys five every time it's in
stock, they're probably flipping it or
making jewelry.
&gt;&gt; You would think so. Um but I think with
my bullion guy, I just call him our
bullion guy. He is obsessed with this
stuff. He just got into it years ago.
People come and talk to him like a buddy
named Kevin. It's not I don't know if
he's just here today,
&gt;&gt; but he talks to people that it sounds
like they've been holding for years,
&gt;&gt; decades.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And they only want to talk to him. I'm
like, "All right, well, it's like I
don't really care enough about it."
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But it sounds like there's some real
whales around there. Okay.
&gt;&gt; Serious whale. Like that lady who I
sold, she's bought 10. Like that's her
limit is five a day, but you know, she

[04:00]
limit is five a day, but you know, she
had a business membership, too. I'm like
she's walking with 50k in her pocket.
Like what is she doing?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. don't know. Um I'm not asking,
[laughter] you know, like could be their
own business. But I
&gt;&gt; I assume some of these people have a
have a plan because dude, like what this
is history. Never seen this before.
&gt;&gt; How have you seen demand change over the
last year? Like a year ago was it?
&gt;&gt; So uh well, when we first got it, like 2
and 1/2 years ago, it was a uh we have
it was 1749.
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; And man, people were buying it up within
the moment like like kind of how it was
last week. That's what happened. It was
all over the news when we first got it
though. Yeah, I remember.
&gt;&gt; I We have people cuz we've never seen
this before out of nowhere. People
who've never collected. We've actually
sold a lot to people who've never ever
ever collected before and they're like,
"Is this a good idea?" I'm like, "I
don't."
&gt;&gt; I'm not your financial adviser.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I like to put my money where I can
know it's going to be immediately
available, but savings is for people who
have an investment eye.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yourself?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, I buy Bitcoin mostly.
&gt;&gt; So, this is my physical Bitcoin, right?
&gt;&gt; It's nice to know it's not as volatile.

[05:00]
&gt;&gt; It's nice to know it's not as volatile.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Uh but I would have been nice to get in
Bitcoin when it was that price. Yeah.
Seriously. Seriously. All right. So, I
just picked up some gold here. $4,29.
You go turn this into the cage and they
will pull it out of their safe and give
me a bar of gold and then I'm going to
turn around and sell it immediately.
&gt;&gt; All right. Thank you.
&gt;&gt; All right. Thank you so much.
&gt;&gt; There it is. Good luck. It says mwah.
I mean, you could buy a used motorcycle
with this money. All right. So, now that
we have the bag, we've got the gold, we
need to see if we can find a local gold
buyer to buy it from us for about 4150.
Is that right? All right. So, we're
going to try Dallas Gold and Silver
Exchange. Let's see what they have to
say.
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon, Dallas Gold.
&gt;&gt; Yes. I have a 1 oz Lucky Dragon from
Costco Gold. Um, what would you pay for
that today?
&gt;&gt; Is it a bar?
&gt;&gt; It's a bar. Yeah. 1 oz bar
&gt;&gt; right now is we would buy it from you

[06:00]
&gt;&gt; right now is we would buy it from you
for $3,97641.
&gt;&gt; Okay, thank you. Oh, $3946.
So, we can go online to a certain
website and sell this for $4150ish.
4160. So, that is a bad price. We're
going to try a couple more, but I'm
betting you anything we're not going to
get a good price from these local buyers
cuz it's a smaller pond that we're
fishing in. We we want to go to the
internet. And if you pay $30 to
overnight something via FedEx, it's well
worth it when the product is 100 times
that. So, let's go to Frisco Gold
buyers. I feel bad for hanging up on
her, but we're just wasting each other's
time.
&gt;&gt; Connect you.
&gt;&gt; Frisco gold buyers.
&gt;&gt; Hey, I've got a 1 oz gold bar double
dragon. What are you paying for those
nowadays?
&gt;&gt; AI is taking notes.
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; you looking at about 3,900 right now.
&gt;&gt; All right. Thank you. Um All right. So
now we should go to FedEx or go on on my
phone and try to sell this to that
company.
&gt;&gt; Okay, so this is arguably the most

[07:00]
&gt;&gt; Okay, so this is arguably the most
important part of this entire
transaction. Costco is special because
they sell gold for below what they call
the spot price or the market price. In
any investment, you make your money on
the buy, not the sell. So Costco ensures
that we buy it right. But as we just
saw, we can't sell this gold locally
because local buyers are not willing to
pay enough for it. We need a much bigger
market. And so this website,
Collectpure, they're a marketplace,
pitcher, eBay, if it were only for
buying and selling precious metals. So
we're not selling to Collectpure. We're
selling to another individual that's
buying through CollectPure. And then
Collectpure plays the middleman. When
they send me a FedEx label, it will go
directly to Collectpure. They will take
it out of the packaging and validate
through their testing tools and
materials that this goal is actually
real. Then they will say, "Hey buyer,
trust me, this is real. Hey seller,
thank you for sending us real gold. And
then they hold in escrow the gold from
the buyer until they've tested it to
make sure it's validated. This also
prevents any buyers from saying, "Whoa,

[08:01]
prevents any buyers from saying, "Whoa,
whoa, whoa. I never got the gold. The
guy dropped it off my doorstep, but it
never arrived." That's impossible
because they only used sign on delivery
with FedEx. And they take a video of
them repacking the gold after they test
it to validate its authenticity. So I
list it for sale on Collect Pure. Once
it sells, they send me a shipping label
and I go to FedEx as you see here. I
want to triple pack it because the
packaging is free anyway. I might as
well make sure that it's safe. Get a
receipt, take pictures of everything
just in case, and then ship it off.
Collect Pure receives it, they unpack
it, they validate it, they repack it,
they pay me, they ship it to the
eventual buyer, everyone's happy.
Collectpure takes a little bit of a
profit in between, and then you do it
over and over again. All right, the gold
is now out of our hands. We went to
FedEx. We printed a label. We triple
packed it just to be safe. We took a
picture of the bar just in case any
funny business happens when it arrives.
We want we want insurance. We want to
keep our receipts because we're talking
about thousands andor tens of thousands
of dollars here. So now we wait to get

[09:00]
of dollars here. So now we wait to get
paid. Now let's talk about how to
actually make money from this scheme.
You can earn up to 7% on this gold. 3%
from your credit card. The Venmo card is
great for this. Or you can use credit
cards that offer 3% cash back on
groceries. assuming that they categorize
Costco as a grocery purchase because not
all credit cards do. I'll put a list to
all these resources in the show notes.
So, that's 3% from the credit card, 2%
back from Costco. We're at five. And
then there's a special company that
enables you to pay off a credit card
with a debit card and get 2% back in the
process, which makes this a total of
about 7%. So, you're going to lose 1 to
2% right off the bat when you sell the
gold. But then hopefully you're going to
make between 5 and 7% from all the cash
back rewards, which will net you out at
about 5% cash back total. Now, that
doesn't sound like a lot, but it can
really add up if you're doing higher
volume. My friend Braden has a full
tutorial on all this, and I'll put
everything down below where you can go
