these stories if not then I'll see you
somewhere else

[02:00]
so my name is Chris Kerner 37 years old
I live in the suburbs of Dallas Fort
Worth I have a wife of 16 years we got
married and I was 21 she was 22 and four
kids when I was young I lived in Logan
Utah I lived across the street from a
golf course and I was pretty broke my
parents didn't make much money and these
golf balls I I live across the street
from the 18th hole and these golf balls
would fly into my front yard and one day
I had the idea huh I should sell these I
could make some money for a yearbook or
for a field trip or for some candy and
so I did I started Gathering these golf
balls I'd go across the street there was
a ditch full of cattails and mud and
water and I would dig for golf balls and
then I got a little more Brazen and I I
jump the chain link fence into the 18th
hole at night with a flashlight search
for golf balls in the golf course then
I'd go in the lakes and I kept getting a
little more bold a little more Brazen
and I would find as many golf balls as I
could I'd bring them home in like a
plastic garbage bag and I'd wash them
clean in my Red Rider wagon and then I

[03:01]
clean in my Red Rider wagon and then I
would walk down the busy road and if you
look up a Park Avenue in Logan Utah
today it is a busy road I lived at I
think 1099 Park Avenue and I would walk
from my house to the clubhouse and try
to sell them in the parking lot until
one day the clubhous manager came out
and cussed me out that was the first
time I'd been cussed out so I never went
back there I don't like confrontation so
then I thought huh I need to put some
signage out on my road because Park
Avenue is a busy road and so I got a big
4 by8 piece of plywood and some spray
paint and I just wrote golf balls three
slash for a dollar and I leaned it up
against my mailbox and I would wait all
summer for these golfers to pull into my
driveway and hand me a few bucks for
nine or 10 golf balls that was my first
business and it paid for my Schwin
bicycle and all the candy or peaches or
plums I ever wanted because I love
eating fruit that's always been my thing
and so I would get a my bike I'd ride to
the Macy's grocery store that is now a
gym I think and I would buy candy and

[04:00]
gym I think and I would buy candy and
fruit and then I would wait for the bus
with my friends and I would eat candy
and fruit on the back of the bus that
was my first business I was like eight
or nine years old in Logan Utah at 11:
we moved to Florida Central Florida my
dad got a job at Kennedy Space Center
and I that that entrepreneurial Gene
kind of left for a while I got
interested in girls and in wrestling and
in surfing and friends and hanging out
and my parents were still pretty broke
but I just didn't care about starting
businesses for a while and so at 15
years old I got a job at a Mexican
restaurant called Elon Sito and it's a
famous Mexican restaurant it's still
there it's right on us one and I was a
bus boy with my mom and my sister all
three of us worked there uh I had three
siblings one brother and two sisters and
half of everyone in the family was
working at this Mexican restaurant and
that's how I made my my money to go out
and hang out with my friends and so I
wrestled in high school year round I'd
go to the beach with my friends I had a
great I had a great childhood with great
parents and then then at age 19 I served

[05:01]
parents and then then at age 19 I served
a mission for my church The Church of
Jesus Christ of latterday saints you've
probably heard of us we used to be known
as the Mormons and we go out in white
shirt and ties at age 18 or 19 for 18 to
24 months anywhere in the world maybe
it's LEC Texas maybe it's Tasmania I
served in Hungary um in the city of
Budapest the capital city I was there
for about half the time and then I was
in outlying cities for the other half of
the time and that is where I met my
current best friend and business partner
NE kulaski he goes by co-founders Nick
on everywhere on all the socials and I
went first to the Missionary Training
Center in proo Utah and they taught me
they tried to teach me Hungarian for 12
weeks you don't really learn a lot
though until you actually get to the
country so after 12 weeks of learning
hungar and with 10 others that were
going to Hungary I flew to the country
and I met Nick he was my first uh
companion also called my trainer and we
spent all summer 2006 knocking doors in
Buddha so Budapest is split in half by

[06:01]
Buddha so Budapest is split in half by
the river uh danu and the east side or
the west side is called Buddha and the
east side is called PES and so we were
in a more affluent part of Buddha
knocking doors and Street contacting
people all day every day in my broken
Hungary and Nick trying to teach me and
we just became fast friends we were
companions for three months or two
transfers basically the whole summer of
2006 and then we went our separate ways
about 6 months later he went home and I
stayed he he went home at the end of his
two years and I stayed my whole two
years and had an amazing life-changing
experience and really what that mission
did for me was teach me how amazing
America is I never understood that I
never saw what was special about America
because it's all that I knew and then I
went to Hungary and I would meet these
amazing people that had multiple college
degrees that couldn't make more than $5
an hour and they didn't know how to get
out of that they didn't have opportunity
there was too much regulation they
didn't know how to make money and they
were just kind of burdened by the sins

[07:00]
were just kind of burdened by the sins
of their father so to speak and living
in this country that used to be run by
Communists not too long ago actually so
I came home from Hungary and I was just
ready to take on the world I didn't know
what but when I left I didn't know what
I wanted to do for college but for some
reason on my mission I thought I want to
do business internationally I want to do
international business that's what I
want to do and so while I was on my
mission I had a very serious girlfriend
that I had actually baptized into our
church and we were we were close we were
going to get married for sure but 6
months into my mission she got married
to my friend without ever telling me she
just stopped riding me out together and
then my mom told me that her and he were
hanging out a lot and then I found out
that they got married so that was a huge
blow big distraction on my mission just
it was very it it was tough honestly and
luckily I had a my best friend one of my
best friends in high school her name was
Jesse she lived in Florida near me and
she had moved away to Alabama after a
couple years years and we didn't really

[08:00]
couple years years and we didn't really
stay in touch but while I was on my
mission about halfway through she came
back home and she sat next to my mom in
church and she said How's Chris doing my
mom said oh he's on a mission in Hungary
you should write him so she said what's
his address so she got my address from
my mom and she started writing me
physical letters believe it or not this
was 2007 and I started writing her back
and we kind of rekindled this Crush SL
friendship over letters in the summer of
2007 and we wrote each other Faithfully
for that second year of my mission she
sent me gifts and snacks and I happened
to come home from Hungary the same week
that she had spring break it was March
of 2008 and she said hey how about I
meet you at the airport and it's like I
was very excited but also both of us
were pretty nervous because it's a
little awkward I hadn't seen her in
years and is she totally different am I
totally different but we said let's just
go for it so she drove down from
Tuscaloosa Alabama she was a student at
the University of Alabama to Titusville

[09:00]
the University of Alabama to Titusville
Florida and then she went with my family
to the Orlando Airport and there she was
and I have a picture of this moment that
I'll upload here anyway we hit it off
quickly we started dating the next day
we went to a church dance the day after
that we got engaged a month later to the
day on her
birthday and then about three and a half
months after that we got married we got
married in the Orlando Temple for our
church so in our church we get married
we try to get sealed for time and all
eternity in these holy temples there's
only a couple hundred of them around the
the world and so we have been happily
married for 16 years and she is
incredible she's my everything and I've
got a lot of sins I've got a lot of
faults but my marriage is just about
perfect and I can say that with full
confidence and that's because she just
makes it easy we see eye to eye on just
about everything it just makes life nice
and easy and we have trials we've got
kids that have had serious illnesses
we've moved all over the country several
times but my marriage is is Rock Solid
and I'm grateful for her and for that

[10:02]
and I'm grateful for her and for that
anyway so I came home from my mission
got married very quickly and when I came
home from my mission I had to report to
the leadership in my local U
congregation it's called a a stake High
Council and there are 12 of them and I
had to sit at this boardroom and
basically present to them how my mission
went and it sounds a lot more
intimidating than it is they're actually
very kind and they just want to hear
stories from me and so I told stories
from my mission this was the Sunday
after I came home in March of 2008 and
then they said what do you want to do
with your life Chris what's next and I
said I want to do international business
whatever that means and afterwards one
of the gentlemen pulled me aside his
name is Nate Quigley and I look up to
him to this day and he was the CEO of a
company called live TV and I'd never met
this man I'd never heard of live TV and
it was about an hour away from me in
Melbourne Florida an hour south and he
said Chris I'm looking for an intern in
our finance department pays $10 an hour
and it's just for the summer of 2008 and
I said absolutely signed me up that

[11:00]
I said absolutely signed me up that
sounds like business and I want to do
business and so live TV was the first
company that actually enabled live
television on airplanes that was their
claim to fame and they were owned by
JetBlue they were subsidiary of JetBlue
Airlines and so I took that job I made
$10 an hour and I bought this $1,500
Kawasaki motorcycle and every single day
I would ride it down I95 to my job it
was a 95 and I filed papers and I
learned what AR accounts receivable and
AP accounts payable was
and I learned General business
principles and I worked with great
people and it was a very corporate
setting but it's all that I knew and I
loved it and I loved the environment of
business and my hours were flexible they
just wanted me to work 40 hours a week
they didn't care when and so I would
work 10 hours a day from Monday through
Thursday and then every Friday I would
still get on my bike and drive to
Melbourne but I would go to Barnes &
Noble around the corner instead of toay
TV and I was too broke to buy any
business books so I would just sit there
all day day and read books about you

[12:01]
all day day and read books about you
know Real Estate For Dummies startups
for dummies Rich Dad Poor Dad 4-Hour
Work week I would read all these books
but never buy them and then I would go
to Taco Bell and get three bean burritos
no onion for lunch and I would do that
every Friday and when I came home from
my mission and I saw how incredible
America was I had this confidence that I
never had before because when I was in
high school I was just like a I was just
I wasn't anything special I was just a
kid I was doing dumb things I had a 3o
something GPA I was cheating on my tests
and cheating on my quizzes and I took a
couple AP classes that I barely scraped
through and I was just dumb and I wasn't
motivated I had no big plans or
Ambitions College who knows the only
thing I knew was that I wanted to go on
a mission that's it that's all I knew
and I didn't even really want to be
wealthy or rich or successful I didn't
have any plans I didn't know what I
wanted to do in college but then when I
came home from Hungary I got rejected
over 22,000 times in hungry and I added

[13:00]
over 22,000 times in hungry and I added
these up I had a journal and we went
door knocking and Street contacting
almost all day almost every day and I
got rejected tens of thousands of times
and that plus the contrast of how
amazing America is compared to most of
the world how much opportunity we have I
came home from America ready or I came
home from Hungary ready to Take On the
World with all the confidence you would
ever imagine I had it and so when you
take that plus all this knowledge that I
acquired from Barnes & Noble never
having bought a book just reading it in
a comfy chair I was ready to just be the
biggest businessman you have ever seen
and so that summer of 2008 was very
transformative for me and I maintained
this long-term or this long-distance
relationship with Jesse my wife because
she was still a student at the
University of Alabama working and taking
summer classes and so we would you know
every other week we would fly to each
other but we were trying to plan this
wedding while I was working full-time
and learning about business so then

[14:01]
and learning about business so then
August 080808 August 8 2008 I got
married we went on a quick honeymoon to
the Virgin Islands came home put all of
my stuff in a U-Haul trailer and we got
her Toyota Corolla and we drove from
Titusville Florida to Tuscaloosa Alabama
and because I hadn't started college yet
I hadn't done anything but taken two
Community College classes before my
mission and two AP classes so I went to
Tuscaloosa and I broke and I started at
Shelton State Community College and I
just wanted to save money so why go to
Alabama first so I did I went to a
community college and got my associates
degree and I wanted to start businesses
um but I needed money I needed a job
first and so we lived at this little
attic apartment right off campus and
this Thai restaurant had just opened
called Surin of Thailand and I thought
I'm going to go be a server because they
can make good money so I just walked
around the corner it was like a
two-minute walk and I walked in and I
met a manager named net NE and he's a
great guy and I'm still friends with him

[15:01]
great guy and I'm still friends with him
today and I applied for a job and he
gave it to me and then I said hey can my
wife get a job get a job she has
experience waiting tables and he was
basically like H calm down we don't like
spouses working together maybe we'll see
how it goes she was waiting tables at a
steakouse but it wasn't going very well
they weren't very busy and so I started
working at this tire restaurant and I
don't like serving tables I don't like
waiting tables I'm an introvert I don't
like talking to people I don't like
pretending to become friends with
someone that I'll never see again and I
don't like it when servers do that to me
but it was a job and it paid the bills
and I worked really really hard and I
got the attention of net he liked me so
I finally convinced him to bring my wife
on board and she became a server too and
he was very cautious and I'll never
forget the first night we served
together we served a party
together and she's a great hard worker
and I'm a hard worker and we did a great
job and that the head of the party went
up to net and said you know what Chris
and Jesse and I don't know if he knew
that we were married or not but like
they are amazing servers you have really

[16:01]
they are amazing servers you have really
great servers and I just thought man
that we are going to get this all the
time like what are the chances on our
first night working together someone
would go out of their way to compliment
us this is going to happen all the time
and I think it in the three years we
worked together it might have happened
two or three more times but it was just
kind of a neat tender mercy so to speak
that they did it on that night because
from then on net was sold that Jesse and
I were good to work together and
so we both worked at That Thai
restaurant she would walk to class at
the University of Alabama and I would
drive to class at Shelton State they had
two different colleges all right if you

and then I I eventually applied to be a

[17:02]
and then I I eventually applied to be a
student at the University of Alabama and
I got in and we kind of hit this turning
point
because we wanted to buy a house so my
timeline's a little off here but seven
months after we got married we had been
looking for a house now this was 2008
into 2009 the housing market was a mess
Alabama was more immune than other
states because it really never
appreciated a lot so there wasn't much
to crash but nonetheless people weren't
buying houses and we wanted to buy a
house as two broke college students with
student loans waiting tables at 2113 an
hour per tip uh plus tips we found this
lady named Ginger Pennington and she was
a loan officer and I don't know how I
don't know how but we made it work we
took out a loan it was not an FHA loan
it was a conventional loan 35% down we
found a $90,000 house about 7 minutes
from campus it was 60 years old
three-bedroom one bath it had been
listed for 6 months and I just wanted to
own real EST estate that's all I wanted

[18:00]
own real EST estate that's all I wanted
to do it had been listed for 6 months
and the we called the realtor that was
listing it for sale which now I know you
shouldn't do they're representing both
parties and I said hey I want to buy
this house and she said okay well and
she learned that I was young and
impressionable and dumb and so she's
like well you know what the sellers just
won't they just they won't take a price
reduction so I'm sorry and I was like
that's okay we'll buy it anyway idiot
it'd been on on the market for 6 months
so paid full price $90,000 and we moved
in we broke our lease we gave our lease
to some friends we were paying $500 a
month for that attic apartment on campus
and our mortgage was $541 per month so
we thought wow that's an upgrade we've
got a carport a driveway we got
neighbors three bedrooms and a bath we
are living the high life we had a great
day and this was the American dream and
so then in this time President Obama was
giving $8,000 tax credits to people that
bought their first home first home buyer
tax credit and it was literally an

[19:00]
tax credit and it was literally an
$88,000 check that you got in the mail
after buying and that was a big reason
that we bought believe it or not and so
about 78 months later after chasing down
the government we got an $8,000 check
and we both agreed let's put this into a
rental property and so we found a rental
property 5 minutes away in a rough part
of town it was a four-bedroom two bath
and we found it from one of the
gentlemen that we waited tables on
regularly his name was Sam he didn't
became a great friend he sold us this
house for about it was like
$53,000 and it was in a rough part of
town once again and we were now rental
property owners and we never had a
problem renting it out I think we rented
it for 900 bucks a month which is not a
bad return for a $53,000
house and we rented it to all walks of
life I remember one time we rented it to
a Hispanic family that was in town for
landscaping and one day I went to check
on them because they hadn't been
responding or paying their bills and
there were like 14 air mattresses in the
house and candles everywhere because
they had stopped pay their electric bill
and they couldn't see so there were a

[20:02]
and they couldn't see so there were a
lot of people living in that house and
it was really a wakeup call as to what
being a landlord is like so that was a
great learning experience it was also
very tough I remember my wife had to
retile the bathroom once and she did not
the best job but better than I would
have done just watching some YouTube
videos and so that was our second house
after only being married for a year and
then my wife got pregnant with my what
is now my oldest son and and we didn't
have any health insurance we didn't have
any money well I mean we got pregnant on
purpose we wanted to get pregnant but we
didn't have a plan and I was only 22
when she was pregnant and then I was 23
when he was born and so I had to get a
job and I had heard that the county jail
was hiring and so I went and applied for
a job at the Tuscaloosa County jail and
talk about a miserable job I got it it
was like $14 an hour which in 2009 or 10
was amazing and I had full benefits
healthc care and all that time off but
at the same time met I had also applied
for a a full ride scholarship to be on

[21:02]
for a a full ride scholarship to be on
the Alabama speech and forensics team
now believe it or not Alabama at the
time had like a top 10 program for
public speaking they had a traveling
public speaking team where you would go
and compete against other state schools
and it was a really good team and I had
experience speaking in my church and on
my mission and so I'll never forget I
had to go apply by giving a public
speech to the current team and the
adviser for the team and I gave it on
investing in stocks in the stock market
and they I got in and it was a full ride
fouryear all expenses paid to school and
I got this at the same time I got that
job in the jail and this was a big
turning point in my life because I had
to decide do I chase this dream and get
this scholarship that has a real
monetary benefit and probably an amazing
experience I was going to be gone a lot
I was going to be traveling and
competing or do I take this horrible job
in the jail that will provide for my
family and provide uh insurance for my
child I couldn't decide so I'm being a

[22:02]
child I couldn't decide so I'm being a
man of faith I prayed about it and I I
felt strongly that I needed to take the
job in the jail and so I never took that
scholarship I took the job in the jail
and I don't regret it it was quite the
learning experience working in the jail
although it was absolutely terrible it
was the worst job I've ever had I would
it was the midnight shift 7:00 p.m. to
7: a.m. 3 to four days a week and I was
a guard I would go guard the inmates and
serve food and take fingerprints and mug
shots and it was absolutely terrible and
I had it for exactly nine months just
long enough to have insurance for when
my son was born but I'm glad I did and
some I have some crazy stories from that
so we had my first son and I started
some businesses during this time I
started a business called textbook Crook
and I had my rental house that was CK
properties and textbook crook was a
Marketplace for students to buy and sell
textbooks to each other and I had all
kinds of little businesses at the time
but one day I was on campus and I saw
sign that said I'll fix your IPhone $60

[23:00]
sign that said I'll fix your IPhone $60
and I didn't know what an iPhone was and
I had a dumb phone it was a palm prio or
something with a physical keyboard it
was bright red and then a day after that
I was in a group doing group work at
Alabama and one of the students said I
have a broken iPhone in my drawer if
anyone wants it and I said I want it you
know growing up broke I'll always take
free stuff so he gave me this broken
iPhone I didn't even turn on I went back
to that flyer and I said hey can you fix
my iPhone he said come to my dorm room
so I did and he had this little LCD
screen and I watched him fix it he had a
suction cup and a little he had a
suction cup and LCD screen and a
screwdriver that's it and I just
peppered him with questions just like I
do today with business owners and I said
where'd you get the LCD screen how long
does it take where'd you learn how to do
this I got it from eBay it's $15 I'm
like well I'm paying you 60 wow okay I
got it from eBay learned on YouTube and
I just had this light bulb moment where
I can do this I can do this business so
right around the same time I read this
article about this business called
iPhone MD and they were in Baton Rouge

[24:01]
iPhone MD and they were in Baton Rouge
Louisiana they were LSU students and
they started a a physical retail iPhone
repair store and there was a line out
the door every day and they were
bragging to the media about it and they
were making $20,000 a month and they
were planning their second location on
Airport Road and apple tried to sue them
because they used iPhone in their
business name so they had to change
their name to my phone MD and I was just
like man if these guys can do it I can
do it this will be my first real
business and so I started doing research
and and I looked up locations and I
found a retail store right next to a
Subway in McDonald's on 15th Street in
Tuscaloosa 15th Street and McFarland
which is like the busiest intersection
in the county tusca county and I signed
a personal guarantee on a 5year lease
505 East 15th Street sweet C and it was
$2,300 a month and I had no money to my
name and the suite had been vacant ever
since the building was built for years
no one had taken it and my commercial
real estate agent was like oh you got to
sign a 5-year lease that's just what you

[25:01]
sign a 5-year lease that's just what you
got to going to have to sign a personal
guarantee looking back it's like no this
place has been vacant for years I I
didn't have to do anything I could have
done a six-month lease with an option to
terminate but I didn't know any better
and so I started a business and I'll
never forget I went to the Small
Business Development Center and I wanted
to get some advice on my business plan
and I talked to this Boomer that owned a
home inspection business and I was so
excited about this business and I told
him about the guys in Louisiana I told
him about the iPhone how they're making
millions of them and it's going to be
the next big thing and this guy just
laughed me out of the room and he said
this is a stupid idea this is dumb he's
like that rent is too expensive you need
to open up in the ghetto where it's $500
a month instead of 2,300 and I was like
yeah but they put bars on the window
they put bars on the Windows there like
who's going to go there to get their
like what Sorority Girl is GNA go get
her iPhone fixed in the ghetto he like
no no it's too risky you got so I left
there so angry at this man so fired up
and that taught me a lesson that I still
use to this day and that's if the haters

[26:01]
use to this day and that's if the haters
know more about the industry or as much
as you do then listen to them take their
advice to heart if they don't then just
let it be a chip on your shoulder and
ignore them let it Propel you forward so
I open this business phone restore and
it was very slow and my first customer
was my entrepreneurship professor and I
was very grateful for him Anthony hood
dror hood I still appreciate him today
and he brought me his wife's iPhone I
paid they paid 60 bucks and that was my
only sale that day the next day I had no
sales and the first month was just slow
I was barely covering my bills if so I
don't even remember and then one day I
went to the mayor's office I just
knocked on his door and said Walt Maddox
I said Walt will you host my grand
opening will you come to a grand opening
I'm a student and I really leaned on
that hard I want to have grand opening
and he did and then I emailed the
tuscala news and the Crimson white which
was the newspaper on campus and I had
this big grand opening and from then on
things were different and I had a
business and I could tell you all kinds
of stories about that business but I
won't do a time but I ended up opening
four locations over the next 18 months

[27:02]
four locations over the next 18 months
one in Birmingham two in Huntsville
Alabama and then that one in Tuscaloosa
and we got taken out by a tornado April
27th 2011 a swath of tornadoes came
through the southeast hundreds of people
died 50 of them were in Tuscaloosa and
it went right over our store and we
couldn't pay the bills we put another 4
by8 plywood sign with spray paint out
just like I was a nine-year-old in Logan
Utah again said you know iPhones will
fix your IPhone and we made it work it
was right before the summer so there
were no students it was a tough time we
just opened our second store but somehow
we made it work and I ended up selling
that business two month two years later
and I started a company called LCD cycle
and LCD cycle was a so phone restore got
to six figures in Revenue it ended up
getting I sold two-thirds of it to some
Partners I kept a third it ended up
getting to seven figures in revenue and
then we sold it for about a million
bucks and that was nice I got an exit in
my
20s and the day after selling it the

[28:00]
20s and the day after selling it the
first time I sold it I started a company
called LCD cycle and we bought and
recycled iPhones iPhone screens and we
would send them to China and that's a
whole story in and of itself but LCD
cycle grew like Gang Busters we did 2.1
million our first year 4.8 our second
9.6 our third and then year four we kind
of started to stagnate we got to eight
figures in Revenue but then we started
to stagnate because the market got a lot
more saturated and I wasn't paying as
much attention to it as I should have
been honestly but that ended up being a
really good business it paid me millions
of dollars to helped build this house
that I'm sitting in today our dream
housee on a few acres in a great school
district and then we ended up selling it
a year seven or eight that was LCD cycle
and then all along the way I've been
starting all kinds of other businesses I
started a company called mining
Syndicate that's still around today it's
been three and a half years and we did
$10 million in sales our first three
months profitably bootstrapped so that's
an eight figure business
I started a company called Texas snacks

[29:00]
I started a company called Texas snacks
and we're The Unofficial exclusive quote
exclusive seller of all bues products
worldwide and so bies is a popular gas
station chain that originated in Texas
they have about 55 locations but they're
multi-billion dollar company and they
don't sell online and so we did that for
them and I kind of growth hacked my way
I kind of forced my way in there to sell
all their stuff online and it's a good
it's a good seven figure business today
and my partner Kirk runs it and does a
great job I own another business or we
started another business with my partner
Kirk called called sends they got to
seven figures in revenue and then we
ended up firing all of our customers
sends was a thirdparty logistics
business for food brands which is a
fancy way of saying if you sold food on
the internet we managed all the
logistics for you that was a really
really tough business not very it was
profitable but not very profitable
single digit margins really really tough
to make work so we ended up basically
shutting it down firing our customers
going all in on Texas snacks the buy

[30:00]
going all in on Texas snacks the buy
business because that is a profitable
business it's hard but we've cracked the
nut we figured it out the hardest part
is behind us and we grow uh about 30%
year-over-year so that's a good business
I've started over 70 businesses and I
have some other podcast and YouTube uh
videos documenting that I it's going to
be like a four or five part series and
I've done two or three of them but I've
started a lot of businesses period end
of story and I'm always hopping from
business to business and I believe in
focus focus is important but that's not
what I've done and so that's given me a
unique advantage of having seen lots and
lots of Industries in lots of different
lights and I'm able to apply different
learnings and marketing methods across
these industries when it comes to
business I Ma I like leadership I don't
really like management I love marketing
I just love it I love taking old school
marketing methods with new school
businesses or new school marketing
methods on Old School businesses my
dream my retirement the the thing I do

[31:01]
dream my retirement the the thing I do
every day that I love the most is
running marketing tests um validating
business ideas testing testing testing
maybe it's a Facebook ad maybe it's
flyers on cars maybe it's ringless
voicemail drops or cold calls or texts
or cold emails or going door too and
asking questions market research getting
the first dollar in the door zero to one
over and over and over and over and over
that is what I love and so today me and
my partner Nick the trainer for my
mission we own a company called
co-founders and co-founders owns about
six businesses we have a software
business a tree trimming business an RV
park mining Syndicate Texas snacks and
then basically our content business I
always forget some of our businesses
some of those are profitable some of
them are not some of them require a lot
of handholding some of them do not
furthermore I have other partners in uh
a private Equity Real Estate fund called
Blue metric we buy one to two large RV
parks and campgr every month alongside
investors and so I help Source those

[32:01]
investors and so I help Source those
Parks I help Market those parks and I
help raise money for those parks in 2019
I started buying mobile home and RV
parks with two partners we bought over
20 mobile home and RV parks between
Kansas Texas and Georgia alongside
investors and it went well until it
didn't and it crashed landed very
horribly because of a bad decision that
my partner made that I will talk about
in an entirely different video
nonetheless we were collecting $80
90,000 a month in rent we had eight
figures worth of property we had a
handful of employees and I took that
experience and I leveraged it into what
I am doing today as a co-general partner
in Blue metric we are buying one to two
large RV campgrounds every month we own
21 at this point and we have I don't a
couple thousand employees and we're
closing in on $80 million of parks under
our belt so that's what I'm doing today
alongside co-founders as well
furthermore I have all this content I
have a podcast a YouTube channel and all
this where I just talk about about
business I love business I love
answering business questions I love

[33:01]
answering business questions I love
seeing young entrepreneurs start their
first business I love helping them
personally I have four kids I've done
some crazy things I run I've run 15
ultramarathons I spent all of my 20s at
260 pounds I was just fat and then one
day on our anniversary our 10th
anniversary in Hawaii I looked in the
mirror and I just said what happened
Chris like what are you doing you're 260
lbs my wife blessed her heart never said
a word to me about it never complained
never told me I should watch what I eat
it was just myself I just saw myself in
the mirror or in pictures and said
you're done you're done with this and so
I went on keto for 5 months strict keto
I went from 260 lbs to 200 lb that was
five years ago five and a half years ago
and I've been 200 lbs ever since once I
lost the weight I started running like
force Gump I'd never run before I'd only
wrestled in high school and I thought I
want my first race to be a marathon and
so 3 months after I started running I
ran a marathon then after that I learned
what Ultra marathons were I learned
about David gogins and a month after my
first marathon I ran an ultra marathon

[34:02]
first marathon I ran an ultra marathon
and then I was hooked I was addicted you
can tell I'm kind of all or nothing I
have an addictive personality and so I
started running Ultras first 34 mile
then a 50 mile then 100 mile then 140
Mile and I've broken some fastest known
times on some Trails I'm not skinny I'm
200 lb 63 I'm built more like a tight
end than anything but I've got a good
endurance Gene and I can just keep going
and I just keep eating food and keep
running over and over and over so I
really love endurance events I love
doing 100 two 300 mile bike rides I love
pushing my body to the Limit and doing
hard things I have four wonderful
children they're all two years apart to
the month believe it or not three boys
and a girl my second oldest is a girl
and at age three she was diagnosed with
pulmonary hypertension which is a rare
inter terminal lung disease it's a
disease where the arteries in your lungs
are too narrow they're too muscular and
so your heart has to pump overtime 247

[35:00]
so your heart has to pump overtime 247
to get the blood through and so her
resting heart rate her whole childhood
would be in the 120s to 140s resting and
so her lips would frequently be purple
she couldn't really climb stairs without
getting out of breath she couldn't play
sports she couldn't run around and it
was really sad she had to literally
carry a metal oxygen tank for a while
like you see old people carry eventually
she got an electronic oxygen
concentrator and life was tough we put
her in studies in Denver we had to fly
to Denver every month and that didn't
work we you know we tried experimental
drugs and nothing really worked and at
the end of the day the doctor said this
isn't she's got a year to live we've got
to we've got to do a double lung
transplant and so with about two weeks
notice we in the December of 2021 we had
to move from Dallas to Houston Houston
has the best pediatric lung transplant
facility in the country so we did we put
this house that I'm sitting in on Airbnb
we couldn't rent it out on short notice
and we needed someone to pay the
mortgage and so we moved to Houston we

[36:02]
mortgage and so we moved to Houston we
rented
a600t house which is about a quarter of
this size of this house in a
neighborhood and we lived there for 6
months and 6 weeks after we got there we
got the call at 10 p.m. one night that
said we have lungs for your daughter we
think they look good they're coming from
Nebraska and so we rushed to the
hospital like we had planned we had a go
bag ready at any given time we called
the neighbors as we had planned they
came over watched our other three boys
my wife and I and daughter and we drove
to the hospital to Texas Children's
Hospital in Houston and my daughter
received lungs from a boy named Sam
Walman who was an eight-year-old boy he
was the same age as as my third child
and Sam woke up one day having seizures
and he never really woke up again and
his parents selflessly donated
everything they could they saved eight
different lives with his donated organs
one of them my daughters and so that was
a trying period but the the surgery went

[37:00]
a trying period but the the surgery went
perfectly and the recovery has gone well
it's been two and a half years the first
year is the riskiest as far as rejection
is concerned we don't know what the
future holds because lungs are the only
transplantable organ that are constantly
exposed to the outside air and so she's
at risk unlike a kidney or a liver we
she can't be around a dust particles she
can't be in a barn she can't go in caves
which is not like this is a big burden
to us but her lungs are very fragile and
so the best help for us is for a second
lung transplant in you know two to 20
years lungs last on average eight years
some go 15 to 20 and so we're hoping for
a second lung transplant at some point
in the future or some sort of medical
advancement but she's happy she lives a
very normal life she takes a bunch of
pills every day but she no longer has
that original disease that she was born
with that had really no cause it was
idiopathic we don't know what it came
from it wasn't genetic so she traded the
disease for someone else's lungs and

[38:01]
disease for someone else's lungs and
that's it's a good trade-off we're happy
for it and so a year what was it a year
after what would have been Sam Sam was
her donor what would have been Sam's
ninth birthday on that same day I
donated my kidney to a stranger in honor
of Sam to thank him for what he did and
then the following year my wife this
year donated her kidney to a stranger as
well on the 2-year anniversary of her
lung transplant
um or I can't remember if it was the
anniversary of her lung transplant or of
Sam's death because they were two days
apart so my wife and I have now donated
both of our kidneys to strangers and it
was an amazing experience and we've
suffered no adverse effects there's no
dietary restrictions there's no pills we
have to take um basically if one in
every 10,000 healthy adult Americans
healthy adult Americans if one 10,000
donated their kidney to a stranger then
no one would die on the kidney waiting
list whereas today about 4,500 people
die in the US per year waiting for a

[39:01]
die in the US per year waiting for a
kidney
unnecessarily we have two and we need
one so I could talk about that all day
but I'm a very strong proponent of organ
donation living organ donation so that's
me I've got a lot of crazy stories I
partner with John Mack if he wants the
Bucky story is a whole video in and of
itself I have an extreme bias for Action
I have business ideas all day every day
which is is cool it's fine it's
interesting but I also have this Quirk
where I can't not do something about it
like maybe I just tweet about it maybe I
have to launch it that day but so I have
this extreme bias for action and all
these business ideas and I just have to
put them together so this podcast this
YouTube channel is a way for me to talk
about it right talk about everything I'm
doing give you ideas because I have more
than I need so hopefully you can take an
idea you can copy me something I'm
already doing or something I'm talking
about and you can start it that's the
whole purpose of this I really want
people that are stuck in dead-end jobs
or stuck in amazing jobs that they hate
I want them to start a business some
people love their job and they want to

[40:01]
people love their job and they want to
be a 9-5 that's great I want people to
be happy but there are a lot of people
millions of people out there that would
prefer to own a business they don't want
to be under the thumb of their boss and
so I'm here to help encourage and
motivate them not to sell them courses
not to talk about Drop Shipping but to
just talk about business experience talk
about how to market products and
services in unique ways that's why I
create this content I want you to quit
your job if you want to quit your job
because I don't want people to die with
regret I've done things that I regret
but what I don't regret is checking that
box right like I've started businesses
that failed I started businesses that I
ended up abandoning but at least I
answered that question for myself I
started to use car business once it was
a concierge car buying service and it
was terrible I hated it it was
successful but I quit it because I
didn't enjoy it but you know what if I
never started that I'd still be
wondering today what would happen if I
started Pres St cars would that have
been a good business I'd still be
wondering and I don't wonder anymore so

[41:01]
wondering and I don't wonder anymore so
I don't want you to wonder if you wonder
what it would be like to own a business
I want you to at least check that box
and check it out see it for yourself you
might end up going back to your job and
if so great but you might find that
there's a whole world out there that you
just love that is so much better than
your job and I want to do whatever I can
to help you find that so that's why I
create content on the internet I'm
driven by chips on my shoulders I'm
driven by people that have said um
things to me that piss me off frankly
that drives me I have a lot of
supporters way way more supporters than
I have detractors and I love my
supporters but the people that I think
about when I'm trying to succeed are the
ones that did not believe in me so I'm
grateful for them as well hopefully you
learned something today hopefully you
learned something about me that makes me
a little different thank you for
spending time out of your day to listen
to me or watch me and I will see you in
the next episode
