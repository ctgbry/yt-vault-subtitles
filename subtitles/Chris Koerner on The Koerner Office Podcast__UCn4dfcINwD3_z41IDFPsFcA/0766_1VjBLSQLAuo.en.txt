[00:00]
If you can carry in a stubborn load of
groceries, [music]
you can make 10 grand a month flipping
coaches. Anybody who hates their job,
like it's the dopest [music] gig. The
only way that I could stay afloat was
just slamming 16-hour doubles and
[music] I was just headed towards like a
mental health crisis. So, in my first
half month, I made more in my evenings
after full-time work than I did my
nursing job. [music] 2023, I did 183K
and that was with a 3-year-old in tow.
&gt;&gt; Wow.
&gt;&gt; It doesn't feel like work. Lots of days
[music] off during the week. $200
purchase for a $5,200 sale.
&gt;&gt; Whoa. I don't put pants on for less than
a thousand bucks. The time [music]
freedom is stupid.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, [laughter]
&gt;&gt; it's awesome.
&gt;&gt; So, the other day I'm swiping Instagram
as I do and I come across this guy
called the full-time flipper. And what
does he do? He flips couches in rural
Canada on Facebook Marketplace. He makes
six figures a year, working part-time,
golfing a ton. He's got kids, his wife
works, and he just buys couches and

[01:00]
works, and he just buys couches and
sells them. Or he gets couches for free
and gets paid to take them to the dump.
Or he sells the free couches. His name's
Tim, and what he's doing could be
replicated in any market, large or
small. If you like Shannon's episodes or
the appliance rental stuff or the garage
shelving stuff, you are going to love
this. Tim is a ball of energy, and he
shares everything. He holds nothing
back. All the tactics are in here.
Please enjoy. Well, Tim, why don't you
tell us who you are and what you do? My
name's Tim Mloud. I flipped couches.
Used to be a nurse. That was fun, but
just not enough money. Kind of put
myself in a hole with adulthood. Got
married really young. We had one kid and
that was good. And then another kid on
the way and my wife was kind of at her
limit. The only way that I could stay
afloat on this little financial
treadmill I got myself pinched on was
just slamming 16-hour doubles. And I was
just headed towards like a mental health
crisis. So, needed something extra.
Overtime needed to be replaced
desperately. All my options for
replacing the income sucked. Like I
could relocate or commute an hour away
and make danger pay like a mental health

[02:00]
and make danger pay like a mental health
asylum with my current nursing
certificate. Going back to school
sucked. Like I scraped through the first
time. The thought of going back was
brutal. I just needed to replace the
overtime. I didn't want to overhaul
everything. I just wanted to replace the
overtime. I just needed something extra
to take the edge off. And I had some
success flipping phones and iPads
because that's all I really understood.
&gt;&gt; I've done that.
&gt;&gt; Okay, these are worth 450 down the city.
there were 300 bucks because saturated
with inventory. It was kind of like a
just geographical arbitrage. Bring them
up to the stakes where there was no
supply and uh they moved way better and
my in-laws were in the city so it was
easy. Go for a free meal, grab some
phones, come back and every single one
was like a nursing paycheck because
after taxes was like 180 for a nursing
paycheck. So couple phones would take
the edge off. And then I had this
terrible experience selling a couch
because so many people wanted it, but
everybody is like, "Could you drop it
off? I'll pay your asking price, but
could you bring it by?" I was like, "No,
without a little [laughter] Mazda 5, I
can't."
&gt;&gt; I was like, "I cannot help you. I'm so

[03:01]
&gt;&gt; I was like, "I cannot help you. I'm so
sorry." And then finally, I hit a
deadline and my best option was some guy
who was under asking price because he
had to go get a U-Haul. He's like,
"Could you do this? I got to rent a
thing." I was like, "Yeah, sure." And
so, who got paid? U-haul got paid. It's
like, hold up. If I had a truck, I could
have done that. That would I'd lost 200
bucks for not owning a truck was the
dilemma.
&gt;&gt; And so, I pitched the idea to my brother
Ross, who's a business owner. And uh the
idea at first was an excuse to justify
buying a Ford Ranger because I thought
it would make me feel like a man. And uh
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; and that's a pretty small truck as far
as trucks go.
&gt;&gt; Small for a couch.
&gt;&gt; I was driving a I was driving a Mazda 5
at the time, you know, they're like mini
minivans, the little four big upgrade.
So, anything's an upgrade.
And uh he said, "That's a cool idea and
I think that you'd be good at it. Like
the phones and iPads things like you're
really reliant with that, but don't
start eight grand in debt. That's so
stupid. Just borrow my trailer." And I
was like, "I don't have a hitch." He's
like, "Go get a hitch." I like, "Okay."

[04:00]
like, "Go get a hitch." I like, "Okay."
So
&gt;&gt; on your Mazda 5.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So I put a I put a $450 hitch and
wiring on a four-cylinder car. Just put
it on the Visa. My wife almost talked me
out of it. She's like, "Don't do it.
That's a terrible idea." [clears throat]
And I was like, "I can pay for the
hitch." Like that was that was my first
goal was just pay for the H, break even
on that. If it's a failed experiment,
whatever. I know I can make 500 bucks
after a couple whatever. And the other
experience. So there was my couch
experience and then my in-laws scored a
sweet deal on Bosch washer and dryer.
Just someone who moved and the new place
had nice ones and they had already
brought their old ones so they just had
double sets of nice stuff. And um same
thing, truck privilege. My father-in-law
got a sick deal on washers and dryers.
So, I thought I was going to be doing
appliances and they even got the dolly
for it. But then the first day that I
got the hitch, picked up the car with
the hitch on it, borrowed the trailer,
and I was like, "What can I get? What
can I get?" And the only thing was a
free couch. I was like, "All right,
let's do a couch."
&gt;&gt; You were just anxious to do something
with this trailer.
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Anxious to pay off the hitch.
&gt;&gt; Yep. Yep. Just uh itching for activity.
And so, I got a free couch. It was this

[05:02]
And so, I got a free couch. It was this
beige microfiber. Had some uh you know
the ones that just like hold every water
stain.
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. They get they get ugly so
quick. It was one of those. And so with
20 minutes in the driveway with a damp
cloth, just like make the whole thing
wet and then it dries evenly and it
looks new
&gt;&gt; for 5 minutes.
&gt;&gt; So a free couch, little bit of sweat
equity of just a damp cloth and then
just being the dude with the trailer and
it sold for 280
&gt;&gt; and a nursing or a nursing shift was
180.
&gt;&gt; So I was like,
&gt;&gt; "Wow."
&gt;&gt; So if I go if I do like what was the
whatever math it was, I'm just like if I
do this many couches. So immediately I
called I just called scheduling office.
I had the trailer. I had the hitch
couches. I was like, "Okay, I can do a
couch camp." That was easy. I renegged
on all my overtime. I called up the
scheduling and said, "Cancel all my
doubles." And I wasn't uh I wasn't shift
work. I I barely touched my um scope of
practice with nursing. Like I went
straight to the comfy job with a nursing
home. Eight hour shifts, free parking,
four minutes from home, just comfy,
comfy, comfy. I reaged on all my

[06:01]
comfy, comfy. I reaged on all my
doubles. So canceled all the two to 10
shifts. So just just my six to twos. So
10 of those every pay period and then
all day at work I'm just hiding in the
med room just like shopping for couches.
Shopping for couches. Just lining up an
evening.
&gt;&gt; Yes. Are you still interested? Yes. Are
you still interested?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
And then just line up pickups. And my
wife's at home with a baby and she's
sending me coaches too and we just line
up profitable evenings. We had a little
sad season there too where we had a
miscarriage and so we're really itching
to just get out of the house because
just like the normal of like come home
from work, watch office reruns or play
Call of Duty, whatever I was into at the
time was just so dark. Like I just hated
being home.
&gt;&gt; We just needed a distraction and couches
was a beautiful little distraction. So
hit the road and uh my first month I
borrowed the trailer on the on July
10th.
&gt;&gt; What year was this?
&gt;&gt; 2019. Summer 2019. July 10, I got the
trailer and in my first what, twothirds
of a month, half month, I made more in
my evenings after full-time work than I

[07:00]
my evenings after full-time work than I
did at my nursing job. Three grand
profit in two and a half weeks,
whatever. And that was mostly free
stuff. I was playing it super safe.
Wasn't like 60 bucks for a couch set,
like couch love seat, but for the most
part, it was just like free
three-seater, free three-seater, just on
repeat, just rinse and repeat.
&gt;&gt; If you could go back in time, would you
still start with free stuff? Is that a
good way to start or knowing what you
know now, you would have started
differently?
&gt;&gt; If I could brain transplant into like
the confidence of just like that's a
$3,000 sectional and they're giving it
away for $1,000. Like I have a different
confidence now. But it was it was so
safe to slowly scale up of just like,
okay, that's a that's a $250 couch.
That's a $400 set.
&gt;&gt; Okay. And then there was one time where
it was a leap of faith and another like
my wife trying to talk me out of it of
don't do it, don't do it. Where I spent
900 bucks on a lazy boy sectional. was
this big gray and at the time millennial
gray like everybody just wanted gray
fabric sectionals. That's all anybody
wanted. And uh I had my eye on this

[08:00]
wanted. And uh I had my eye on this
sectional. It was at 2 grand, 1,500. And
then I saw the price drop to a,000 or
something like that. And I got it for
900. Had it firmed up for 900. She tried
to talk me out of it and I was like, I'm
going to do it. I'm doing it. And uh I
bought it. I think we're into like
September now. So the days are getting a
little shorter. It came home in the
dark. The next day I'm working or on
break I head to the locker and do photos
and videos and measurements and stuff
like that. List it there and then drive
back to work. And by the time I got back
to work, it was firmed up at 1,500
bucks. [sighs]
&gt;&gt; By the time you And it's a four-minute
drive.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. With a $150 delivery. So a 750
profit on the don't buy it, don't buy it
catch.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And this was like your first risk, like
your first risky buy. Oh yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, for sure. And it was the biggest,
the fastest, the easiest. No repairs, no
restorations. It was just straight up
someone hit a deadline and then the game
changed.
&gt;&gt; Real quick, please subscribe to my

[09:00]
&gt;&gt; Real quick, please subscribe to my
channel. I know it's kind of lame to
ask, but it means a lot. Thanks.
&gt;&gt; Then it was just like, "Oh, buddy,
&gt;&gt; let's just position oursel to be first
in line when situations change." And so
that's what I'm doing now. And it takes
the pressure off too because at first it
was like I'm just refresh refresh
refresh looking for the people who are
um pricing it impatiently out of the
gate. That's not fun. That's stressful.
What I'm doing now is doing big shops
once a week starting 30 conversations.
Okay.
&gt;&gt; And then when people's situations
change, you get notifications because
the price changes, the description
changes, they mark it pending, then back
available. It's like, oh, someone bailed
on them. And so it's positioning myself
to be first in line when impatience
strikes.
&gt;&gt; So you're starting 30 conversations
regardless of price. Like it's an item
that you think you could sell, not
regardless of item, but the price is
kind of irrelevant because you're you're
willing to be patient.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm I'm just looking at pictures.
What do I want in my lockers is all I'm
looking for. And I start those
conversations. Like I started a

[10:00]
conversations. Like I started a
conversation with today who's got a
couch listed at four grand. It's like
it's a pike dream. I'm not going to tell
her that because I burned the bridge.
But she paid 10. She deserves four. Not
how it works. She might get 1,500, but
she's too proud. You can tell by the
listing in the house and the description
and everything like that. She really
thinks she's getting four for it. No
chance.
&gt;&gt; They just appreciate a lot more than
people realize.
&gt;&gt; Worse than a BMW. They're painful. Like
I have so much sympathy for the people
that I buy coaches from. A lot of the
times it's like there's there's not
going to be a win here. Like I can tell
by the wording. I can tell by the we're
in no rush. A lot of the times it's like
they're thinking about changing up their
decor. There's no opportunity there. I'm
looking for the people who have move out
dates, house closing, new one arriving.
I'm squeezing those details out of them.
Just like any hard deadline, it's like
no, no, we're good. Coach arrives in the
20th, 20th.
&gt;&gt; So, that's a key part is the questions
that you ask to determine the how
motivated they are, the timeline like
when to follow up for sure, etc.
&gt;&gt; I am looking for impatience,
indifference, and ignorance is a big one

[11:02]
indifference, and ignorance is a big one
too. A lot of times it's like
millennials, millennial couples who were
gifted like a dope burnhard sectional
from their in-laws or something like
that. And either they don't know what
they've got or like to them it's only
worth 500 bucks. But it's like no that
was an $8,000 sectional and you guys
took okay care of it. That's 1,550 to me
and ignorance is on there too.
&gt;&gt; What are some green flags in a pitcher?
Like what are you really looking for for
the big money makers? moved to the
garage already with a Porsche in the
background in the driveway. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; There it is.
&gt;&gt; Moved moved to the foyer hogging up
space. You can see the new couch in the
background which is like, "Oh, buddy,
&gt;&gt; I'm I feel like a turkey vulture. It's
like you're gonna
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You you need me."
&gt;&gt; Do you re do you reference those things
in your messaging at all or do you just
kind of internalize it?
&gt;&gt; How so?
&gt;&gt; Like let them know like listen, I see
it's in your garage. Like I can come get
it. like clearly you've already replaced
it. It's taking up a lot of space or do

[12:00]
it. It's taking up a lot of space or do
you not go that route?
&gt;&gt; Yes, but not in a way like that. That
sounds like if you're playing poker like
talking just like you didn't get that
ace, did you buddy? Like that kind of
stuff. It's [laughter] not like that.
It's I am offering I'm compensated from
a reliable pickup service with a smoker
deal on a couch. So I let people know
that hey, if you hit a deadline, keep in
mind there's a guy from Msoka who will
come. I can lift something by myself.
You already got in the garage. Oh, your
husband doesn't even need to be home.
I'll e transfer the whole thing right
now. I'll text it, pop the garage open,
I'm out of there. So, the fact that I
can I can lift them by myself, I'm
willing to send e transfers like full
pop a lot of the time. And uh there's
hurdles about selling a couch and just
hop them.
&gt;&gt; What are the best types of couches?
Either brands or sectionals or sofas or
or does it not really matter?
&gt;&gt; Definitely matters. I like to work
backwards. Think about like who is my
ideal customer profile on the buying
side. They are homeowners with either
renovations that just got finished or a
new house or they just had they just

[13:00]
new house or they just had they just
bought a couch from the box store and
their kids and dogs smashed it. Now they
know that a used Lexus is better than a
new Kia and they they're just like I'm
not paying the depreciation. Like that
thing lasted three years. I would way
rather get something rock solid. And
that's all my inventory is is used Lexus
is just like the nice bones full grain
leather built to last stuff. I have lots
of repeat customers and lots of
referrals, but very rarely am I taking a
couch that I sold to the dump? Like I'm
just moving premium.
&gt;&gt; H how [clears throat] many times have
you had to do that? Just throw something
away.
&gt;&gt; Like dump runs for my customers. Oh, all
the time.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Or just something you couldn't
sell?
&gt;&gt; Nah, I'll fire sale it. Like I'll I'll
make a single mom's day and I'll take a
loss. Like if it's I pay 300 bucks and
it's just like gh I'll move it for 200
bucks. make someone stay that way
because I would rather do the driving of
shame and my my inspections are so
shameless. Like I'm like sticking my
nose in people's couches and just like
that's piss. You lied to me. [laughter]

[14:00]
that's piss. You lied to me. [laughter]
I would rather I would rather do the
drive of shame than pay for a couch or
bring home a cat piss couch or something
like that. You know, that's always the
decision when when I find something
that's a mess is just like what drive of
shame do I want to take? Do I want the
empty trailer or the cat piss couch in
the locker? And I'm empty trailer all
day. I'm hanging on every word. I'm
loving this conversation. You don't even
know. I'll go.
&gt;&gt; What do you charge for dump runs?
&gt;&gt; Dump runs start at 100 bucks. So, if
it's a three-seater, if it's I'll always
ask, is there a recliner or a pullout
bed in it? Because if it's a recliner,
it's going to be heavier on the scale.
If it's a pullout bed, the mattress is a
flat rate of 38 bucks because of the way
that my recycles them. If I come into
the couch, they're saying, "Is there a
mattress in it?" And there's a flat rate
upsell. Whether it's a whether it's a
king bed or a twin bed, it's 38 bucks.
So, but 100 base and that is super
affordable compared to junk removal.
It's not affordable compared to having
the brother with a truck come pick it
up. And that's totally cool. I don't I
don't uh want to be cheaper than the
brother with a truck.

[15:00]
brother with a truck.
&gt;&gt; Roughly speaking, like what percentage
of your jobs are not revenue, but jobs
are dump runs?
&gt;&gt; Very rare. I do 20 transactions in a
month. I did two dump runs, three dump
runs.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Not a big part of your business.
And you don't want it to be, I'm sure.
It's kind of nice icing sometimes
&gt;&gt; only having one side of the transaction,
not having to manage a buyer. It's nice
just not having to sell it. You just you
get your money and you know it's going
to the dump. You don't have to list it,
etc.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. It's just it's like my fries
with that of just like and it's just
icing. The dump's pretty close to home
and if I have stuff that's a dump run at
home now that's a business expense. Like
it was paid for with the customer. You
know what I mean? Like it's just
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; It's a nice little addition. Not a post.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Plus, it's just it like it secures
the five star review too of just like
all of their couch related issues I
handle.
&gt;&gt; Are you doing exclusively all this stuff
on Facebook Marketplace or other
platforms as well?
&gt;&gt; So, in Canada, our Craigslist is called
Kijiji and I love I prefer Kijiji for

[16:03]
Kijiji and I love I prefer Kijiji for
buying because that's where the boomers
I think predominantly actually no. I got
in trouble for saying that one time. I
had a reel that did really well
performance, right? Because all the
boomers in the comments were like That's
not true. I'm on Facebook.
&gt;&gt; I've done the same thing.
&gt;&gt; But, uh, I really prefer Kijiji for
buying because it's also chronological.
It's just easier to keep track of.
Facebook's kind of just like stuff gets
thrown at you and there's like a
gravitational pull to the rails tab.
Like I'm constantly just like, "No, Tim,
back to couches. Couches." [laughter]
&gt;&gt; Watch. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Road rage videos. And
&gt;&gt; I much prefer Kijiji, but Facebook outs
sells Kijiji probably nine to one. What
are some of the best deals that you've
ever done? Like best flips?
&gt;&gt; The goat was Eleanor. That's pinned on
my um Instagram page. That was a $200
purchase for a $5,200 sale.
&gt;&gt; Whoa. It was
&gt;&gt; dope. It was a Restoration Hardware.
That thing made my knees shake. It was

[17:00]
That thing made my knees shake. It was
20K new. It's just art you could sit on.
Like, yeah, that was a really, really
nice couch. And uh I probably could have
posted it for eight, but as soon as you
post price,
&gt;&gt; you can't raise it.
&gt;&gt; So yeah,
&gt;&gt; I had it five grand and I had six people
ready just like I'll send money right
now. Can I please have it?
&gt;&gt; Wow.
&gt;&gt; Even at that price point.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, even at five because at that point
it's like it's like people who they'll
they'll never have an opportunity to
&gt;&gt; like it's an heirloom piece like
Restoration Hardware 20K new 5k like you
can get plywood and pleather for five
grand. I think people might be thinking
like, well, you know, Facebook
Marketplace, it's for the lower end of
the market or but like you either want
to be the most expensive or the most
cheap, right? There's people at both
ends and everywhere in between.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm like a middle grounds between
retail that comes delivered and new that
you have to pick up. Like I'm I there
isn't really competition between my
listings. It's a very very unique offer
of it's a used couch on Facebook
Marketplace, but I did the inspection.

[18:02]
Marketplace, but I did the inspection.
My video inspections are really thorough
so there's no surprises on them whether
they come to see it or whether they take
delivery site on scene which is often
and that's the goal with my videos is
where it to be good enough it's like
yeah for he literally showed me all the
reasons not to buy it
&gt;&gt; and uh highly doubt with that much
detail that there was anything missing.
So yeah sure bring them back
&gt;&gt; and do you lead with the video first on
the listing when you go to sell it? Yes,
I pioneered videos on on listenings.
Like it was way back when that was my
like signature move was that when they
message me, hey, is this still
available? I would have a keyboard
shortcut. Yep. With two Ps. Yep. It
expands into, "Yep, here's a quick
little video inspection of it." And then
I'd fire over a 59 second video
&gt;&gt; that showed all the reasons that they
would not want to buy it
&gt;&gt; and then they could make a good decision
right there. Since then, Facebook
realized I was a genius and now you can
add videos to listings.
&gt;&gt; What are your numbers like today? like
how many couches are you flipping on a
monthly basis? What is your revenue and
profit like?
&gt;&gt; The year to beat is 2023. Uh this year

[19:02]
&gt;&gt; The year to beat is 2023. Uh this year
was softer and that was mostly my fault
in the spring. I kind of took my foot
off the gas pedal and uh didn't have
enough humility in my pricing and stuff
was moving slower, but I'm on the men
now. The goal is always 20k sales gross
profit. So just sales minus cost of
goods usually settles north of 10, like
15 grand probably after expenses. But
it's it's so muddy. Like I hate the
n-word of net profit because it's just
so muddy. Cuz it's so much personal
expenses. Like it's my I got car seats
in the back of a soccer mom SUV. Like
I'm driving a 2009 Toyota Highlander
Sport with car seats in the back. And so
that's my grocery getter and kids to
school and church mobile and stuff like
that. So it's probably like an 80K a
year income,
&gt;&gt; too.
&gt;&gt; Gross profit. 100K.
&gt;&gt; Over 100K. six years running in revenue.
&gt;&gt; Here is a quick triedand-true business
idea for you. There is an all-in-one
platform that handles CRM, email
marketing, funnels, booking, all of it.

[20:01]
marketing, funnels, booking, all of it.
Everything a business needs to run and
grow. It's called Highle, but you can
completely white label your own tools
with it, which means you can rebrand the
entire thing as your own software and
sell it to local businesses. It's got a
built-in prospecting tool that pulls
local businesses, shows exactly where
they're screwing up, and then you can
pitch them the fix. Find the problem and
solve the problem on the same platform.
It's stupid easy to set up. It has drag
and drop builders, pre-built templates
for everything, so you're not just
starting from scratch. Then you can
charge monthly. They get their problem
solved while you build recurring
revenue. So go to gohighlevel.com/tkopod
for your first 30 days free. And this
could legitimately be your next
business.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, 2023 was dope. I did 183K
in sales. Um, gross profit was 120 after
expenses, probably like 90k income. And
that was with a three-year-old in tow.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Because my wife went back to work. She

[21:01]
&gt;&gt; Because my wife went back to work. She
was sitting on a nursing license and
then she got an opportunity to go on the
supply list and she had a lightning fast
teacher career launch. She's already
full-time grade seven teacher, but that
year was she got an offer for supply
list and she's like, "I don't know,
babe." Like, "How would it work?" I was
like, "Do it. I'll take Hudson. No
problem." And we did. She She hopped in
supply list. She was slammed right away.
And every day I had a little
three-year-old with me. And uh in my cup
holder, I had bottle of milk to get him
to sleep. Like I maintained perfect nap
schedules and drop his sister off at
kindergarten, go to the city, fill a
trailer,
&gt;&gt; bring it home, pick her up. Yeah. Like
record months, just banger after banger
with a three-year-old. And I played 75
rounds of golf that year.
&gt;&gt; Whoa.
&gt;&gt; That's the biggest clutch.
&gt;&gt; How many hours per week would you say
you're working on an average week, give
or take?
&gt;&gt; I wish I had those numbers for you, but
I just it doesn't feel like work. Like
I'm just going for a car ride with Alex

[22:01]
I'm just going for a car ride with Alex
Orzosi just crushing audiobooks and
[laughter]
no way no way am I working 40 hours
though. I don't think I don't put pants
on for less than a thousand bucks. Like
I'll I'll wait I'll send deposits and
I'll stack them so that I can get it all
done. I'll get two or three done in one
go.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Lots of lots of days off during
the week. And the goal is probably three
good double or triple pickups. And then
the deliveries don't feel like work.
Like often it's like wife and kids in
the car and go to Wendy's and grab a bag
of burgers and stuff like that or
squeezing a round of golf. Like the time
freedom is stupid.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, [laughter]
that is awesome. How much time do you
spend flipping each couch on average?
Like how much work do you have to put
into them? If I would think it's like
minutes per couch, some you do nothing
to. What does that look like?
&gt;&gt; I don't rehab. I relocate. You just wipe
them down maybe.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, most of them are asis. I had one

[23:00]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, most of them are asis. I had one
recently where I did a delivery that was
two and a half hours away. $500 delivery
on top of a $1,000 profit. Was a dope
run. And then on the way while I was
there, I shot the area. Hate coming home
with an empty trailer. So, found a
couch, put my nose in it. Cat piss.
Pissed. And got another 300 bucks off
the price. Took it straight to uh my
auto detailer. And uh it was 150 bucks
for them to make it brand new. I don't
clean. It started as a rehab gig, but uh
yeah, ever since that great lazy boy, I
was like, nah. Plus, there was a lot of
times where I would that was a
bottleneck for me. And that's where
that's the difference between it being a
hobby and a business is just like
identifying bottlenecks and smashing
them. And I am a procrastinator when it
comes to cleaning couches or I actually
don't have the skills to fix leather.
I've got a I've got a guy for that where
I'll drop it off to his garage. He was a
a mobile restoration guy. So, he would
get contracts with dealerships and he

[24:02]
get contracts with dealerships and he
would go fix three cars in a day that
were off lease before they'd resell
them. That was his thing. But he gave me
smoke and cash deals because I would
bring them to his garage. And you know
how you can either have what's what's
the saying? You can have it fast, you
can have it cheap, or you can have it
good. You got to pick two.
&gt;&gt; Pick two.
&gt;&gt; His was good. His was good and cheap.
And it was like, "Take it, take as long
as you can. No problem. I don't need it.
I don't need it." Yeah. Put it in his
garage. And a month later, I'd say,
"Hey, is that thing done yet?" He's
like, "Oh, yeah. Come Tuesday, it'll be
ready." So, that was But he's a
magician, but I can count on one hand
how many times I've used them this year.
So, that's my leather guy. And then if
it's fabric for cleaning and stuff like
that, I'd way rather drop it off to the
detailer because they got the big guns.
I had a green little Bissell extractor
machine and uh I gave it away to a
customer one time because a tarp
malfunctioned on me in the winter and it
had salt stains when I dropped the couch
off. I was like, "Here, just have it.
Here's a free machine."
&gt;&gt; You're still just using a trailer for
everything. You don't have like a box

[25:00]
everything. You don't have like a box
truck or
&gt;&gt; no open trailer, utility trailer on a V6
SUV. So, it's like, as far as moving
couches go, it's two trucks for half the
price. It's a 12x6 open trailer. It's
just plain Tetris XL. And uh I've put
some comically large loads in there. In
soggy season, I have to be a little more
particular and like I'm doing like
mental Tetris and how I'm going to tarp
it and stuff like that. And uh sometimes
I'll get a U-Haul for 45 bucks including
insurance for 24 hours for a 12x6
enclosed, but it's got all the
aerodynamic qualities of a garden shed.
Like I'm just chugging gas on those
days. The dream for me is a snowmobile
trailer. 7 by16 full aluminum snowmobile
trailer. I had someone pick up a couch
one time and throw it in there. I was
like, "Oh, buddy." When I saw like how
much room it was in there,
&gt;&gt; you were coveting him hard.
&gt;&gt; Big time. Coveting. Yes.
&gt;&gt; You're two hours north of Toronto.
That's like rural Canada. How How many
people live in your area?

[26:01]
people live in your area?
&gt;&gt; I don't know.
&gt;&gt; What city is it?
&gt;&gt; Muskoka. Typically
around the
3 hours one way mark is when my delivery
fee is discouragingly large where people
are like sorry Facebook's showing me
stuff further away. I don't actually
want it that bad. But the most I've ever
charged for delivery was 600 bucks and
it was three hours one way.
&gt;&gt; Wow. I'm looking it up. Msoka has 66,000
people. Like that whole area.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And then you got Berry. Is that just
south of you?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. That's where my in-laws are.
That's where I was originally picking
up. 150,000 people there. Like that's
not a lot of people.
&gt;&gt; No, we got to be more than that. They
got two Costos. No, that's not true.
They have one Costco, but I feel like
it's more than I feel like it's a half
mil greater barrier area.
&gt;&gt; I mean, maybe like the greater area, but
&gt;&gt; yeah,
&gt;&gt; everyone needs a couch. Like, it doesn't
need to be a lot of people.
&gt;&gt; Correct. And that's I'm really well
positioned where it's like my own little
private fishing pond where I'll rip down
to the city where inventory is so dense

[27:01]
to the city where inventory is so dense
and nobody has trucks. Like I'm buying
in the like Tesla, BMW neighborhoods and
a lot of my stuff does get picked up.
Like it's I'm not delivering everything.
A lot of trucks and trailers come to my
locker to pick up, but they weren't
going to the city. It's like an import
business.
&gt;&gt; What percentage of the quote unquote
market I know like you have no way of
really knowing do you own like of these
types of couches? Like how how much of
this is yours versus if you really
wanted to work a 100 hour weeks, how big
could this be? I only want to buy them
as fast as I can, as fast as they're
selling. I have five lockers. I'll keep
par levels. When I'm when I'm at
capacity, I'll drop some prices. When
I've got room, I'll start buying. Like,
let me show you October. October was
super light, but kind of a banger.
&gt;&gt; You say lockers, you mean storage units?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Five. I got five of them. I had
six. I dropped six was giving me a
complex where that's where the my
pricing was not did humble enough
because it was like
&gt;&gt; Mhm. [clears throat]
I got space. October I did 10,340

[28:03]
I got space. October I did 10,340
in sales with a gross profit. So just
sales minus cost of goods. Um gross
profit of 7240
and that was seven transactions.
&gt;&gt; Wow. Thousand bucks
&gt;&gt; profit per transaction.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's the game for me is uh
saying no to stuff. If I'm driving down
in the city, I want a whale or two
tuners. I throw back all the bass.
&gt;&gt; How big are your lockers? 10 by 20,
three of those. 10 by 25, two of those.
&gt;&gt; And what do those cost in total per
month?
&gt;&gt; They're they're very affordable compared
to the city. I'm like, when I had six of
them, it was 1160 and I just dropped
one. So, I think I'm under a grand, just
under a grand, like 1,100 ft. And they
stack pretty well, too. So, I like to
have lots and have them as showrooms
instead of tuna cans cuz when people
like it sucks to have to pull everything
out to show someone a couch, right? I
would way rather have five showrooms
than three tuna cans.
&gt;&gt; Do you ever dabble with other large

[29:00]
&gt;&gt; Do you ever dabble with other large
items, flipping them, or is it only
couches?
&gt;&gt; Well, I ate a loss on a washer and
dryer. I hurt myself with a dining
table. I
smashed a hutch. I just really like
couches. I can lift them solo so safely.
And that's what my market's looking for.
I get lots of requests for other stuff.
I get offered a million china cabinets.
No thank you. Just catches. I just love
couches and they're so easy. I'll just
throw those suckers around so easy.
&gt;&gt; You can't really break them that easily,
right? I mean, they're just hardy. As
opposed to like a china cabinet,
&gt;&gt; especially premium ones. Yeah. Yeah.
Like the china cabinets, I have to
decide whether I want to break the
furniture or break my body when I put it
down. Whereas couches is like my
movements are so solid. Like it's like
portaging a canoe, you know?
&gt;&gt; That's the most Canadian thing I've
heard all day.
Even if I can't do like the heroic like
clean and jerk from all four feet on the
floor, I can still stand it up from one
end and then use my thigh as a fulcrum

[30:00]
end and then use my thigh as a fulcrum
and let it fall and catch it and then
big and I'll throw it up with my If my
dog wasn't so cute on the couch, I'd
lift this couch for you. But
&gt;&gt; have you ever um hired an employee or
used like contractors or helpers or do
you have any intention or desire to
scale that way or are you good? My hire
that I'm tempted would be a VA to shop
couches for me and just fill up my
messenger and run my scripts and just
have everything queued up so that when
people drop prices and stuff like that
that I'm cuz it's like having irons in
the fire. I need like 20 conversations
on the go at all times to have like five
good purchases a week. And uh I hate
shopping is my least favorite part. It's
the most crucial part and it's just like
I go full hormosy with the headphones
and the caffeine and nicotine gum and
like I just walk in and just like
oh look 300 couches message 50 by three.
&gt;&gt; Do you ever list stuff before you buy it
to see how much demand there is for it

[31:00]
to see how much demand there is for it
or is that kind of tricky because it's
already listed? I do have a wait list.
So I have in my phone the W in my
contacts is very long because it's wants
brown leather sectional wants burgundy
couch love seat that kind of stuff. And
so whenever I have something lined up
I'll be like does anyone want this? And
then I'll screenshot it and crop the
price out of it and say is this one
maybe? And then um as soon as I have my
hands on it I'll send them a video
inspection from the driveway. But very
rarely am I taking something straight to
a customer. It's usually going to the
locker anyway.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. How long did it take you to learn
the values of these things? Like to
really know when you had a good deal on
your hand. Were you just doing a bunch
of research like looking for comparable
couches or how did you work through
that?
&gt;&gt; No. Trial and error and uh school of
hard knocks for sure. The ceiling
besides Elanor, she was a unicorn is
2500 for a catch. That's like a $10,000
sectional. 2500 bucks. And there's some
outliers. Like I've definitely had some

[32:00]
outliers. Like I've definitely had some
3500s and 30,000. No 4,000s though. The
jump is straight from like 3500 bucks
right up to L&R at 52. I want all of my
listings ideally to be north of a,000
bucks. But it's still nice to fill in
the cracks with the odd like $650 couch
love seat and just pump volume with
them. Yeah. The reason October was so
dope with seven transactions and 10
grand was because it was just banger
banger banger.
&gt;&gt; That's what you want. or no, not love
averages, 8020 rule. We just like cut
out all the crap, just whales and
turtis. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Quick question. What if there were a
private community out there of people
that were building businesses based on
this podcast? Well, I just made it and
it's only for business starters and
business builders. It's called TK Owners
and it's basically like having me and
100 other business geniuses as your
business partner. Also, there's going to
be exclusive new trends, growth hacks,
business ideas, and a database of
everything I've ever talked about.
You'll find thousands of startup case
studies. You'll have weekly ask me
anythings with me while I'll answer your

What are some best practices for selling
or buying anything on Facebook
Marketplace?
&gt;&gt; Not procrastinating listing, not
procrastinating anything. Actually, just
constantly on the lookout for
bottlenecks and just smash them. Um,
sometimes a bottleneck will be that the
photo sucked because when I brought it
home, the sun was behind my back and
I've got a big shadow holding the phone
over the thing and I need to go back in
the morning to relist it when the sun is
behind it. Lots of natural light, but no
direct light. So, there's lots of little
things like that. And that's why I got
in trouble in the spring is because I
was ignoring that. Just way too comfy at
home in the ice storm in Ontario. It was
brutal. We got our butt kicked last
year. Best practices,
video inspections for sure, so you can
push people to making good decisions
when messaging people. Key. Okay, this
is the answer I want to give you.
Keyboard shortcuts having everything so
that you're not typing all day long.

[34:00]
that you're not typing all day long.
Like my keyboard shortcuts are just of
just,
&gt;&gt; hey, anyone scheduled to pick this up?
Doesn't need any repairs or
restorations. That's if it's leather.
Doesn't need any repairs or stain
removal. That's if it's fabric. Is
anyone there to help me lift it? I'll be
alone. Um, are weekday morning or
weekday morning pickups possible? And I
will send I'll batch that whole thing.
I'll I'll look at the listing and then
okay, so the listing says pet free,
smoke free and and good use condition.
And then from that I'll fill in the gaps
using my keyboard shortcuts. And then
now their reply is all the information I
need. And then I pump the brakes on my
enthusiasm with a another keyboard
shortcut just starting to have the
peaked good options. might get back to
you. Um because from the when you're
selling, if somebody's asking a bunch of
questions and then they shoot an offer,
it's like now you want it. But when you
slow play it a little bit, and sometimes
it's safe to do that. If it's if they
already have it priced at a GTFO price,
then I'm not going to slowplay it. But
most of the time I'm extracting all the

[35:01]
most of the time I'm extracting all the
unnecessary information and I'm pausing
it with a just starting to have a peek
at options might get back to you
message. you get bonus points for not
ghosting them because everybody else
ghosted them and now you've got good
favor of that and then I'll reconnect
with a polite lowball offer of hey any
chance you'd considered this much for an
out oftowner I could come from MSCO with
trailer and pick up
&gt;&gt; because it came like gift wrapped of
just like I'm so far away could you take
this
&gt;&gt; yeah yeah yeah
&gt;&gt; and that's truthful a polite lowball
offer and I was deceitful I said yeah
&gt;&gt; I'm I'm shopping for my little sister
who got her first apartment I don't have
a little sister I'm the youngest of
three brothers I did that once and then
the lady was like, "Oh my gosh, of
course. Come get it."
&gt;&gt; Then you felt dirty
&gt;&gt; and Oh, I felt terrible. I was like,
"That didn't even it wasn't even
necessary." Like she
&gt;&gt; she was such a sweet lady.
&gt;&gt; And uh I did that once and then I got in
the car and I was like looking in the
mirror like who are you?
&gt;&gt; And uh [laughter]
&gt;&gt; what have you become? It's just a couch.
&gt;&gt; Never again. Never again. Honesty
always, always. Always. And um I want

[36:01]
always, always. Always. And um I want
people to know that I'm a reseller
because I want them I want my name and
number in their phone all the time. I'll
get messages of just like, "Hey, got
your number from Sophie. Any chance
you'd be interested in this one?"
They're my customer, too.
&gt;&gt; That's that's surprising to me that you
would have so much repeat business. I
wouldn't have thought that. It's a
signal that you're really you're working
that like it's intentional. It's not by
accident.
&gt;&gt; Like it feels like skills and tools.
Like in the same way that I sit in my
hot tub and look at all the trees that I
want to cut down, it's like I would kill
myself if I tried that. I need to call
my buddy Mike who's got climbing spurs
and three different kinds of saws and a
dump trailer and a chipper and
ridiculous skill with tying knots and
stuff like that where every time that I
lift a couch with somebody, they'll say,
"Wow, you look like you've done this
before." It's like cuz like it's like,
"All right, we're going to go front side
down. Okay, once we hit this corner, I'm
going to go high. You stay low. Good.
And we're going to rifle it a little
bit. Kind of 45. That's it. Perfect. And
okay, once we clear that armrest, we're
going to buy three inches. And then I'm

[37:00]
going to buy three inches. And then I'm
going to go this way. Can you take a
step to your left? There it is. Perfect.
Like it's like it's just surgical. It's
just a weird little skill set that I've
not only developed, but I actually have
a memory back in high school when uh I
was playing Halo with my buddy Devin in
his basement. And No, that's not true.
No, we were smoking bongs in his
bedroom. That's what we were doing. And
we I was and we we're sitting next to
each other on the bed and it felt way
too intimate for two 17-year-olds. And
uh I was like, "You know what? We should
get that chair from the basement that or
the love seat from the basement that no
one uses." And so we go to get the love
seat. And his idea on how to get it
through the door was terrible. And I was
like, "Hold up. No, no, no, no. This
side down, this side up." And then he he
like laughed and he's like, "Have you
done this before? Like do you want to
start a moving company?" Like that was
so good. and it was flawless. And it was
just like I saw [laughter] it.
&gt;&gt; Do you ever see um Goodwill Hunting? You
know, when he's he's at the he's the
cafe with his sweet girl and uh
&gt;&gt; and she's like, "How how do you know

[38:00]
&gt;&gt; and she's like, "How how do you know
this?" And he's like he's like, "You
know, Mozart sat down and he saw the
piano and he could just play." He's
like, "I can't hit a ball out of Fenway
or I can't hit a home run. I can't and I
all I can play is chop spits, but when I
see this stuff, I could just play." And
just putting putting couches through
doorways and just like
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's your skill.
&gt;&gt; There's some times that pain me that I
didn't have my tripod set up where it
was like I impressed myself of just like
use a tea towel as a slider and get a
couch through a patio door by myself and
then portage it down the stairs and like
I've done some ridiculous solo
deliveries. Um, and it's just a weird
little skill set that that and backing
up a trailer and negotiating negotiating
on Facebook. Like every aspect of this
game is just like all my skills just
combined into one beautiful little craft
of just like, "Hey, you need a coach?
You need your coach picked up?" It's
just I'm good at it.
&gt;&gt; So many of those skills are applicable
to any anything though, like the
negotiating, the so valuable.

[39:00]
negotiating, the so valuable.
&gt;&gt; Yep. And I'd probably be a good realtor.
I'd probably be a good mortgage agent,
but uh gosh, man, time freedom is just
so hard to beat. And then like the
coaching and stuff like that. I've got
lots of guys that are making like 1,500
bucks with my info and just stealing all
my scripts and I've got guys in
California and couple different states
and uh it's dope. Those are my favorite
messages to get of just like selfies
with the kids and uh doing couch pickups
and stuff to just copy and paste what
I'm doing. is really cool. Yeah, couches
is dope for
&gt;&gt; a transition season. Like anybody who
hates their job, it's like, yo, there's
a lot of people if you can lift a couch,
you've got a truck or a trailer, like
it's the dopest transition gig to either
supplement or replace your income and
just pay the bills until the next thing
takes off.
&gt;&gt; Is this something you would recommend to
other people to try? Is that a a
softball question?
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah, totally. If you can, you don't
have to be able to lift a carriage by
yourself. Like some of my students are

[40:00]
yourself. Like some of my students are
string beans that are not able to lift a
couch like I am, but like me lifting
couches is a very very unique form of
laziness where it's like I could jack
knife park the trailer and use a dolly.
It's like nah, I'm just going to pick it
up. I'm the kind of guy who would rather
walk across the house to find my
flip-flops than bend over and put my
shoes on that are right there in front
of me. You know, like it's a very unique
kind of laziness. And that's that's what
the couch lifts are too. If you can
carry in a stubborn load of groceries,
you can make 10 grand a month flipping
couches all day. Like most of the time
when I'm when I'm buying a couch, one of
my first questions is, is someone there
to help me lift it? You can lift half a
couch for sure. And if it's in the
garage already, you can drag it to the
edge of a pickup truck. Like if Brian
Panita can do it, you can do it.
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; I didn't know he was doing it.
&gt;&gt; He was like the original. I thought I
invented it and then someone sent me a
video of Brian Prenita with a red hair
at the time and I was like, "Oh,
everybody's gonna be doing it now."
&gt;&gt; I think you're a lot more respected than
he is. But that's just me. All right.

[41:00]
he is. But that's just me. All right.
Well, Tim, where can everyone find you?
&gt;&gt; Full-time flipper. The full-time
flipper. There's a girl who made a page,
did one cartwheel, took the name
full-time flipper, and so I'm the
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; that's your name on Instagram.
&gt;&gt; Yep. The full-time flipper. Do you have
a website?
&gt;&gt; In the bio, there's my landing page for
the couch course.
&gt;&gt; Cool. Thanks, Tim.
&gt;&gt; Cool beans, dude. Thanks so much for
having me.
&gt;&gt; All right. What' you think? Please share
it with a friend and we'll see you next
time on the Kerner
