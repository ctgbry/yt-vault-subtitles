would you ever pay 40 Grand a month to
break your phone addiction of course not
but would you charge someone 40 Grand a
month to help them break their phone
addiction of course you would people are
paying 40 Grand a month today for this
it's called digital detoxing and it's
one of the fastest growing Industries in
the world right now here's how I would
attack this business if I had zero
dollars to my name I would start with
chat GPT and have it make up a full
1hour seminar that I could teach to
people that I find on local Facebook
groups of parents that are in high rated
school districts I would teach them for
an hour and then at the end of the hour
I would have an upsell and say listen I
teach a one-day master class for $2,500
to you or your kids and I will teach you
everything you need to know about
tracking cookies algorithms phone
blockers Instagram settings so you and
your kids can be protected and so you
won't be addicted to your phone I
promise you can close sales that's
$2,500 a pop and if there's people are
charging 40 Grand it means there's way
more demand than Supply go watch my
latest episode of the ker office and I
talk about this whole strategy in detail
