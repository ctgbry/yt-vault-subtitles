look at this freaking guy right here
this will be the least shocking thing
you hear all day you know all those
private jet pictures and videos you see
on social media it's fake it's all fake
and of course it is but before you play
Boomer on me start looking at this as an
opportunist or as an entrepreneur and
think hm how can I make money on that
I'll tell you exactly how this is called
a private jet photo studio and there's
only two in the United States that I
know of New York and la and then there's
one in Moscow London there's about a
dozen around the world but guess what
there's 8 billion people on this planet
and 99.9% of them live nowhere near a
private jet photo studio but also a
large percentage of them are pretty Vain
and selfish and they might pay for
something like this and it actually
doesn't cost that much to start up you
can charge $40 to $240 per hour or per
photo shoot for these things and yes
there is demand you can list on
marketplaces such as peer space Facebook
Marketplace there's a whole industry
being built up around these so don't
look at this like a pessimist look at
this like an opportunist full business
plan right here
