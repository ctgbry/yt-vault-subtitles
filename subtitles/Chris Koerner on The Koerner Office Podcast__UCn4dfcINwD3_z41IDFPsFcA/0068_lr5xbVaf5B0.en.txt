[00:00]
reverse engineer exactly what they're
doing and treat it just like that
because the biggest red flag to me about
your whole funnel right now is that
someone's really excited about what
you're doing and they fill out a form
and then they don't speak to a human for

[Music]
week welcome welcome to episode 13 of
the ker office we had a great show today
four people called in our first caller
owns a private school in Amarillo Texas
population 200,000 and he's struggling
to grow having trouble growing and it's
actually a licensed private school like
a franchise with a couple hundred
locations around the country and so I
helped him through that and then we had
another caller that was selling a
similarly High ticket priced item they
sell cabins Do-it yourself kind of linol
log type cabins that City dwellers buy
to put out on their rural land for their
friends and family next caller has a
Shopify app that does something pretty
unique they allow Shopify store owners

[01:03]
unique they allow Shopify store owners
to place a clippable coupon on their
product page which seems obvious
Amazon's been doing this for a long time
but it's not obvious so it's basically
the digital version of going to the
grocery store and seeing like the paper
coupons um in the aisles and ripping
them off and feeling indebted to go use
it to go up to the the front of the
store and actually pay for it so I like
to call it strategically introduced
friction it's a cool idea he's having
trouble growing as well so I talked him
through that and then our last caller
had a unique problem he has a good
handful of followers on Twitter and he
post cool interesting business content
and he doesn't want to be rude to all
the people that DM him asking for help
or advice but he also wants to help and
so I walked him through that so I hope
you enjoy today's show please share it
with your friends and family subscribe
like yada yada yada do all those things
that I cringe at myself for asking you
to
do Michael how you doing man hey Chris

[02:01]
do Michael how you doing man hey Chris
I'm good how about you good I've had
your question in front of me for a
couple weeks and it's really interesting
you're out in West Texas like how many
people start an untraditional School in
West Texas it's not normal apparently
just one yeah that's why I wanted to
talk to you I always rate the questions
from one to 10 and I think you were a
solid eight and a half thank you yeah so
tell me about mlo Acton Academy yeah so
it's a learner-driven school it was
created acon was created by Guy Jeff
sanifer in Austin about 12 years ago he
has an active NBA program and the story
is why can't there be a school in the
21st century that is relevant nobody
disagrees that the school system is a
joke Traditional School does not
replicate anything like what we see out
in the real world whether you're an
entrepreneur or not and uh so he built
the School kind of based on the Acton
MBA which is a No Frills 12mon really
fast NBA program and so he launched the
school several people said man I I I

[03:01]
school several people said man I I I
want to do this in my city so then he
created the ability to basically be an
affiliate and so like a licensing
agreement yeah I guess so they have zero
input on how we run the school they
basically give us access to materials
and stuff like that and we we run the
school as we see fit so it's the exact
opposite model of the Traditional School
where the young people are in charge we
don't have teachers we have Socratic
guides they're not even allowed to
answer questions in the studio h
are you willing to share Revenue numbers
sure yeah yeah so how long have you been
opened and then if you could just share
like yearly or or monthly whatever is
most relevant yeah we started in 2020
right in the middle of covid with six
fam all right great timing actually we
had four families we had six Learners
and and four families fast for to today
we have 20 and we charge 8,500 a year
and our revenu is going to be around 120

[04:01]
and our revenu is going to be around 120
I don't know what the math is you said
six Learners or eight we we have 20 oh
20 I say yeah you started with six okay
so 170 Grand a year roughly okay and has
that been growing steadily for the last
four
years yes it we had a few families leave
last year our Middle School is real
small and so some of the
families felt like hey we want our kids
to be around more than just three or
four other kids that's tough and yeah so
we had a few leave but was that the
feedback that there just you didn't have
enough critical mass at that age yeah
okay you know I I guess that's why I'm
asking the question is like important I
I my my question is how how old are your
kids 8 10 12 14 okay so yeah I just I
don't know if I'm not getting the right
message across if I'm not communicating
this correctly everyone that I sit down
oneon-one everybody
leaves a conversation going oh my gosh

[05:02]
leaves a conversation going oh my gosh
this is amazing yeah this is so great
you're doing you're doing what needs to
be done MH okay great I don't know I
don't think so it's just it's such a big
change and I want to go back to the
question you just asked where what's
more important and I don't even think
that's the right question because I
don't think you're going to change their
mind if they think that having friends
at school is more important I would
think I would say you just attack that
from a different angle because that's
just I don't think they're going to
change their mind you're clearly and
naturally more biased than your
potential customers because you love
this and this is your baby and you know
all about it inside and out but to them
I think they're just looking at this
like a huge life change and it's it's
like we should move to Europe oh that
sounds amazing let's move to Europe then
it's too hard this is an actual
conversation that I've had with my
wife so do you have any idea of what
your percentage close rate is from
people that are interested or receive
the info packet or talk to you in person

[06:00]
the info packet or talk to you in person
no it would be very it'd be very small
we have a a lead magnet on our website
and I get notified when folks sign up
for that and we probably have three or
four a week that will request more
information and they'll go through a
three email series all of them with a
some kind of call to action to either
schedule a call or apply and they did
they get they run through that nothing
really happens and then I have assistant
I I run another company also and so I
have my assistant in that company to
help me out so she'll follow up with the
ones that have gone through it after a
week she'll hop in there and email them
and say hey any questions and and
usually it's just
crickets now let's talk more
specifically about your funnel so they
go to the website they fill out the form
and they then they get a three email
series and then what is that the order
of it yes okay and then at what point do
you reach out and try to get them on the
phone about a week after the last email
after the a week after the third email
yes and how long does it take for those
first three emails to go out

[07:00]
first three emails to go out
every two days okay one every so six six
days I'm G to pull up your website
here so they're clicking request more
info specifically right yes okay
so how many people click schedule a
phone call verse request more info do
you have any data on that oh I would say
hardly anyone schedules a phone call
once a month maybe very few people
schedule a phone call okay so when they
do though are they more hot to trot are
they more likely to close no because
what we found is the ones that do it's
more
like they were just you know they just
have a very specific question like hey
is this a they they didn't read through
the website they're like oh this is a
private school you charge tuition like
yeah they're like oh I'm looking for a
charter school sorry thanks and they're
just like in a hurry okay not oh my God
I can't believe this school is in our

[08:01]
I can't believe this school is in our
city this is so amazing tell me more
about it yeah that that hardly ever
happens how are you driving traffic to
your website
today I I'm not just organic correct
yeah I don't pay for ads we have a
really strong pretty strong social media
presence my wife does all that stuff and
so we're really active on there and
we've had people that reached out say
man I've followed you guys for for Years
love what you're doing and then ask for
more information so really we don't have
anything that is paid that's driving
traffic mostly because I'm just scared
of Google ads I've never used Google ads
in any of my companies I'm scared of it
seems like a scam I don't really know
maybe I'm wrong with all due respect
you're
wrong I'm sure I've felt the same way
and one of my business partners still
feels the same way even though and it's
not Nick it's another one and I love him
to death but even though we have seen
positive Roi from Google ads for four
years straight he's still just and I
told him like a month ago I was like I'm

[09:01]
told him like a month ago I was like I'm
gonna turn off ads just watch I turned
off ads and traffic died and he went and
turned him back on himself so I get it
and there's a lot of people and I've
read stories of companies mostly billion
plus dollar companies that have just
turned off all Google ads and didn't
skip a beat that happens but that's
because they're not tracking it closely
or they're tracking the wrong thing or
they're doing like brand campaigns for
brand awareness like a Coca-Cola
billboard on the highway like who knows
if that actually works but I don't do
that stuff ever because I'm like you I'm
cheap I don't want to waste money on ads
especially to a multi-trillion dollar
company that is happy to take it and
have they know all the tricks in the
book to take it and so I will only do
paid ads that show me a very clear
attribution and so I love the idea of
Google ads for this business because it
is local and because Google will tell
you exactly who in your county is
searching for terms that might be
relevant to your business I don't

[10:02]
relevant to your business I don't
recommend that you go out get an agency
I recommend that you actually invest
some time to learn it yourself Google
ads is in my opinion 8020 right like you
can spend a few hours learning the 80%
of it and see a positive Roi and an
agency they might help you scale it
better but you're not you don't really
need to scale it because you're not
looking to take over the world and
they'll help you hone in that last 20%
while they'll really refine the keywords
and they'll add in some new keywords but
I don't think you're really going to
need that I think Google ads could help
have you spent time interviewing or
talking to other Acton license lenses to
see what they're doing or how they're
doing yeah a few and I think it amarello
is a very unique situation the other
ones are mostly in bigger cities and so
in Austin there's probably six or seven
of these and they're all on a wait list
I think a lot of it has to do with
income right so yeah just everyone's the

[11:00]
income right so yeah just everyone's the
private school in Austin is 30 40 Grand
so the Acton Acton down there are
charging 15 20,000 a year and that's the
cheap version of private school you've
got 200,000 people in Amarillo you've
got just under a million in Austin right
so if Austin has six or seven
theoretically if the demographics were
the same which they're not then you
could support a an Acton with a weit
list right theoretically and I believe
even without doing data I I think you
believe that too right that that it is
possible to completely fill up your
weight list yeah and let me be clear if
we had 60 out of 200 thou I'm looking
for I'm looking for 60 Learners that's
it yeah if you were to take your 20
Learners and take their parents and how
would they rate their satisfaction with
you on a scale of 1 to 10 like how much
are they just in love with what you're
doing uh all in and we we actually have
to do a net promoter score and turn that
in every quarter to AC that's one of the

[12:01]
in every quarter to AC that's one of the
things that we do and it's on a scale of
five and we're
4.5 every time do you know how that
compares to other
locations no they don't share that with
the network I I haven't seen but you
can't drop below a four I think before
you start getting maybe you shouldn't be
active anymore yeah if I were you I
would do several things I
would get other Acton owners on the
phone as soon as possible because you
could bang your head against the wall
trying to learn all these things but I
guarantee you you're going to find one
person that just makes one little
comment that just sets off the light
bulb for you oh no they're gonna be like
don't no don't do that like you got to
go through the schools or you got to go
through the whoever and it's just going
to be this light bulb moment that will
save you a lot of time and a lot of
money so I would just cold call them
honestly they would be fine with that
the Network's super generous there's
only 300 actins all over the world and
so they're very generous with their time
one calls another one we would always

[13:00]
one calls another one we would always
help each other when was the last time
you called like corporate and asked them
for help you can't really do that there
there isn't there's one guy that's over
the whole network it's a very Skeleton
Crew if you want to say it's very
similar to CrossFit that's is how
CrossFit got started they put the thing
out there and you Affiliates you take it
and run with it whatever you want to do
is great okay so that's the first thing
I would do I would talk to the other
owners I would look seriously into
Google ads because Google is more intent
like Facebook ads are fine but you want
to find people that are searching for
like alternative schools alternative
schools near me or unhappy with my
school or something like that it might
not be as direct as you're thinking and
when do I start with that because I have
done that a few times and some of my
other businesses like I I'll get on
there I have a Google ads account and I
just get overwhelmed so quickly and
where would you start if I had zero
experience to learn about Google ads I
would start on YouTube I can't recommend
anyone specific but I would bet there's

[14:01]
anyone specific but I would bet there's
dozens of very high quality YouTubers
that specifically talk about like the
how-to of Google ads you can go take a
$50 udemy course I had a friend that did
that in short-term rentals and it
changed the game form that might be a
little more structured for you but if
not UD to me then just YouTube is it you
to me sorry UD DM y the letter U DM y UD
to me yeah it's a course platform and
another thing I would do which I'm even
more optimistic about
is I would take a page out of the whole
clickfunnels I would go to like the
cringiest course gurus you can find and
look at how their funnel works because
it works there's this Airbnb Mastermind
and this I don't know what it's called I
don't want to promote them but they I
think it costs like 12 Grand to learn
how to be a short-term rental owner and
this website doeses like 2030 million a
year selling these high ticket courses I
would go find one like that okay and

[15:00]
would go find one like that okay and
just reverse engineer exactly what
they're doing and treat it just like
that because the biggest red flag to me
about your whole funnel right now is
that someone's really excited about what
you're doing and they fill out a form
and then they don't speak to a human for
over a week I think that you need to
take your form and you need to shrink it
down and just do name phone email that's
it not kids name nothing else name phone
email and then you or someone needs to
get them on the phone immediately and
strive to get them to your facility in
person as soon as possible I guarantee
you your close rate will just explode
it's a lead and every second that goes
by that you don't get that lead
preferably in person if not on the phone
they just get colder and colder and
especially with such a big life decision
like this you got to talk to him faster
than that okay yeah that's what I would
do go find a really cringy guy on
Instagram and look at what his his
process is and copy it and just put
something actually eth behind it

[16:01]
something actually eth behind it
yeah yep cool thanks for your time Chris
I appreciate what you do anytime Michael
let me know how it goes I will thanks
all right yep see you see
you David hey how are we doing hey good
how are you man I'm doing fantastic all
right you got a little kid
there I always have a little kid that's
just my life right now okay who's
that my youngest he's two his name's
Owen oh Owen hi
Owen he can't hear us cuz he's in the
headphone hope he's not too loud there
it is no that's fine all right you've
got a bootstrap company that's about to
hit 10 million in Revenue right yeah
we're tracking to do about 11 or 12 run
rate right now awesome good for you and
what type of company so uh I know I
can't get too specific but we're in the
outdoor space a weird Niche we sell
small Log Cabin kits and ship them all
over North America that's cool okay
who's your Target customer
so our Target customer is 40 to 65 years

[17:02]
so our Target customer is 40 to 65 years
old they live in the city but they have
a rural property outside the city and
they are generally small business owners
professionals middle class upper middle
class people I would say and they Val
are like family they want an extra space
for their family to stay so they can
have everybody at the cottage or
everybody at the lake house or the like
okay and how much do your homes cost
they're AR really homes they're like
small kind of bedrooms essentially but
somewhere between about 6,000 in the low
end to about 20,000 in the high end wow
super cheap and that's for a kit that's
for a kit so you build that yourself and
part of the experience is that you're
building a bunkey with your friends and
family and they're like a Lego kit or
like a linoln logs for adults if that
makes sense that is awesome and it
they're meant for the homeowner to put
together themselves it's easy enough for
them to do that yeah about 85% of home
owners built themselves we've got a
really great set of manuals and build
videos and build support to get people
through it so no one has tried and

[18:00]
through it so no one has tried and
failed everyone has tried to do it has
pulled it off wow now what type of
foundation do they need to put these
down depends on the area but you can get
by for as like with as little as just
put some gravel and some patio stones
down or you can make it as complicated
as like a a fulling cement pad if you
want to go nuts okay and what about
electrical and plumbing uh doable in a
lot of areas once you stray into
Plumbing you're into permits required so
a lot of people avoid it for that reason
but the electrical side of things you
can just run do it on the walls it's
pretty straightforward to do that okay
it's not glamping it's not a tiny home
it's a proper cabin that you put
together yourself that's 10 to 20 grand
exactly right okay that's really
interesting and although we do sell to a
lot of glamp grounds and like we we're
trying to get the B like our B2B
Dimension is a lot of people coming
through the B Toc funnels and still
buying it for a campground or for a
wedding venue or for a trailer park that
type of thing um and so B2B is like un
like if that makes sense we should be

[19:00]
like if that makes sense we should be
able to reach out to B B2B clients but
we have not really nailed that yet okay
so you're mostly doing uh b2c yeah
exactly and how are you finding them so
primarily paperclick on social media and
then we do a big promotion every year we
give a bunky away but still paperclick
feeding that funnel into a a 30-day win
this bunky and then oh you didn't win so
buy one okay what percentage of your
leads are closing side on scene no sales
call vers after a sales call the site
unseen thing it's rare like people are
usually emailing in once or twice there
isn't a lot of randos just come in and
we're not an e-commerce stor we've
experimented with having e-commerce but
generally with a larger ticket item
they're going to want to fill you out
they usually call once or twice email in
there's three or four touch points
before they like feel safe enough to
give us money over the internet and then
we also have a phys like we have a
factory where we make them and so people
come in and see we have a little village
of bunes there as well and then we're
yeah so people will see them sometimes

[20:00]
yeah so people will see them sometimes
in person but it's a good it's a good
minority of people that have never
actually like physically been there and
then we're working on a virtual tour so
we've got a virtual tour experience that
you can take a A salesperson guide you
through a couple models and sell you
that way that's awesome and have you
ever done like a group sales call or a
webinar or anything yeah
I've like abysmal show up rates right
now so I've been I've been rting them
bi-weekly and like you know 50 people
sign up and one shows up yeah we're
trying to tweak that but the contest we
where we do the giveaway I'm doing a
series of live streams where we'll do
one on the foundation one on stains and
so there was like an educational
Dimension to that and if they go through
that 30 days and they're tuned into
those live streams they're pretty solo
by the end of that so a big bulk of our
sales come through it like the week
after the contest
closes okay and what how big is your
email list it's about
350,000 oh wow that's a great list and a
lot of that is is chaff there's some
wheat in there but a lot of people that
want the free bun are not necessarily
going to buy a bun right so it's a lot

[21:00]
going to buy a bun right so it's a lot
of yeah how often do you email everyone
as opposed to just segments we try to
segment as much as we can but we got a
monthly newsletter that goes up once a
month to everyone okay so if you're
going to cross 10 million then you're
selling like few hundred of these things
a year no like the goal this year is a
thousand wow okay yeah so like last year
900 roughly okay okay around 11 11k okay
yeah all right I guess I went High there
okay so your original question now that
we've got all that out of the way is at
what point should you specialize your
sales process vers maybe not specialize
them at all and just keep it broad like
account manager to marketer to
salesperson yeah how does it look today
yeah so right now it's just a duct taped
hodge podge of what's organically grown
up we've got like people that have been
with us since day one a few people and
they're very much oh I want the whole
customer journey I want to like take
them to the factory show them the bun I
want to sell them I want to help them

[22:02]
want to sell them I want to help them
with their delivery talk to them like
they want to do all the steps of the way
I call that the sherpa model like they
take them up all the way up the mountain
that's what they want to do I've always
been more inclined to I just want to
sell them and then give them to someone
else and they get invoiced and they get
and want to make sure the delivery
happens and we have a pretty good track
record of delivering on time and people
being pumped but I can see benefits to
both angles so it's like Sherpa all the
way up the mountain with maybe a little
bit of support here and there versus one
person just sets appointment one person
just uh does a middle call one person
closes like that's the Baton method and
it seems like a lot of people go in that
direction it's l more measurable and you
can see who sucks a lot easier but it's
I don't know if we're at the right size
to do something like that and I don't
I'd like to figure out from someone
who's been there and cross that Chasm
from 5 million to 15 million or 20
million so you're exclusively doing the
sherpa model right now then right so
right now I'll tell you the sales person
we do have outbound people to just call
leads so they're making 130 calls a day

[23:00]
leads so they're making 130 calls a day
their whole goal is set appointments but
a lot of times people call in so inbound
leads so you might talk to someone
they'll say hey let's go on a tour book
a virtual tour book an actual tour and
they might take them to the point of
close so it's like a weird hybrid of
both so we have this appointment CS two
of those people they're from the
Philippines then we've got a couple
people in the factory like showing
people bunkys or doing it virtually and
then we've got another person remotely
in Britain that can do the virtual tour
but not using like a Zillow kind of tour
do able to do virtual tour so my thought
process is the more we can make it
digital and not everyone has to be at
the factory the better yeah have you
ever experimented with an appointment
setter that was based here in in North
America as opposed to the Philippines
not
yet I would definitely try that just
because it's such a high ticket item
such a big purchase the amount of
savings that you get is probably neg
negligible if you can get your
appointment set rate up just a few
percent right yeah that's fair I would

[24:00]
percent right yeah that's fair I would
AB test it as well keep your Filipinos
and and add a couple and just side by
side how many calls are they each making
versus how are they comparing because
it's not even the and I know Filipinos
have great accents but it's not even the
accent it's just the weird kind of
cultural quirks that might only show up
one every three or four phone calls that
really make a big difference where
someone in North America can just make
off-hand comments that are much more
relable much more relatable to the
person than someone overseas might
yeah that's good nice thanks uhuh you're
doing a hybrid model do you know of any
competitors that are doing one or the
other like who are you looking to for an
example on this like the problem with
our little nich is I really I struggle
to find a super analogous competitor
everybody in the like it's the kind of
model is like a guy named Chuck with a
corner lot that sells sheds and there's
hobos living in them and that's the
model for the shed Biz not super
analogous to what we're doing and then
there's other smaller competitors but
we' so far in the small cabin space the

[25:01]
we' so far in the small cabin space the
bunky business we're probably five or
six times as large as anybody it's hard
to say and and then we email our
competitors like what happens after that
and there's no real I don't feel like
I'm in a process or any type of sales
funnel so we're trying to lead the
charge here what I try to compare
ourselves is like other high tech items
like hot tubs boats like anything like
that that I could say oh I can learn
from that that vertical but it's not
necessarily us or I guess Outdoor Living
Like Outdoor Living is probably the most
because they're selling High ticket
stuff sometimes too and if you were to
say let's just pretend for a minute that
your whole sales cycle not just the Sal
cycle but the whole life cycle of a
customer is 100 days and and then at
certain point they actually pay and then
at a certain point their cabin is
completed where would you put the
payment in that 100 day timeline so our
model right now is we take
65% up front to make the bunky to help
us cash flow it and then 35% a day or
two before you get it so that's the but
it's not 100 days like there's 700 day
close on a lot of our clients like so

[26:00]
close on a lot of our clients like so
we're trying the whole point of
appointments and let's book a tour is
shrink that down ideally 100 would be if
I was if I 100 day closing it would be a
fantastic now sometimes it is two weeks
but oftentimes it's two weeks but like
I've been watching your YouTube channel
for two years so
yeah what about between the time that
you first speak to someone and you
collect the 65% what would you say an
average is there an average is there it
just depends how hot they are so if
they're hot it might be a day like a day
to a 10 days we often give people 10
days to pay that if they start chipping
away at it we'll call them in so that's
yeah probably like one to 20 days okay I
feel like you should test the
specialized model I I think that if you
were to just get a killer closer to to
get them there someone really friendly
and then just get someone really nice to
see them through the end of it uh
because they're not going to get their
deposit back I I assume right if they
continue wanting to go through it yeah
is a refundable deposit uh but it's only

[27:01]
is a refundable deposit uh but it's only
when you we sell your bunky to somebody
else so we don't take people's money for
no bunky but we have a kind of it's
refundable as soon as someone else buys
it basically is usually pretty fast how
many take you up on the
refund our refund rate's pretty low it's
maybe 1
in30 okay like over the course of a
season yeah I feel like you should did
you hear the last call that I was just
on no I was in the waiting room and I
couldn't hear anything so I I gave him
advice because that was another high
tiet item
to take a page out of the cringy course
gurus Playbook on Instagram that's try
selling High ticket like $10,000
masterminds and courses and just analyze
exactly how their funnel is and it's
that's finally or like highly refined
over years and years of gurus selling on
the internet right and you've got a
Setter you've got a closer and then
you've got a third person that actually
fulfills yeah I feel like they that is
the model I'm leaning towards that's

[28:00]
the model I'm leaning towards that's
what my intuition tells me to do yeah
that's what I would do like in my uh
crypto business we have something
similar because we sell a $5,000 product
and we there's a lot of handholding that
needs to go into that product for years
after they buy it because we also host
the product and so in that sense it's
easier for us to keep it the same person
because there are going to be a lot of
touch points along the way it it'd kind
of be like if your customers were still
interfacing with you for years after the
house was built like they had to it it
might be a different strategy but
because of the fact that they're good to
go once the house is built I like the
idea of specializing in your case or at
least testing it you don't want to of
course go all in on it because you've
got a good thing going yeah that's fair
so your advice is essentially like lean
yeah get a
few like while you have the appointments
that are just set it up in that kind of
handheld way yeah that makes sense yeah
like just three Setter closer fulfiller
yeah that's yeah that makes sense that's

[29:01]
yeah that's yeah that makes sense that's
what you're doing today fulfiller like
by fulfiller someone invoices them and
then another person make sure that funy
physically gets to them and all that
logistical fun yeah the logistics is
what I mean by fulfiller yeah yeah
that's the model right now we can just
lean heavier in it I think yeah okay I
hope that helps I'd love to how it goes
yeah appreciate your time okay thanks
David okay my pleasure
bye all right sa I hear that you have a
SAS business that you're trying to
grow that's right yep all right let's
hear about your business I want to hear
all about it to give you some background
I've been working with Shopify for eight
years started doing development work and
ran an agency for many years a few years
ago I decided that I wanted
to create my own product for Shopify I
had a lot of knowledge for how the
platform works I knew what customers
were looking for and last year I settled
on what I was planning to do and I ran
with it before you proceed so you

[30:00]
with it before you proceed so you
already own a Shopify agency or at least
you did at the time yeah I I still run
it now and I'm trying to transition more
into having this SAS be my full-time
what type of a Shopify
agency it's mainly just a development
agency so we do a lot of theme
customization work Custom theme
development integration okay yeah that
kind of stuff okay so what gave you this
idea for the app and then what is the
app and why did you feel so strongly
about it to spend a couple years on it
the app itself is called clip coupons
it's uh based on introducing coupons
directly on the product page once the
seller is on the product page you can
offer them a discount code where they go
to check out they forget the code they
Mis entered they get upset there's all
these issues with manual discount codes
the alternative is automatic discounts
and automatic discounts while they're
great a user may not necessarily even
know they're getting that discount
because it's automatic yeah I
is like strategic introduced friction

[31:01]
is like strategic introduced friction
it's a little bit of friction that make
them more likely to get to check out
exactly and the app itself helpful to
many store owners our app is free and
it's a strategic decision to make the
app free it's a massive investment it's
so every week is just money going into
development and into our VA team and
customer support team and marketing team
so I can't sustain it
forever but my question to you is why
at what point do you know in this space
that perhaps it is time that you can
start charging for the product okay do
you have any data on how effective your
app is at increasing conversion rate or
average order value I've been very
hesitant to put out precise numbers I
think right now we're still trying to
figure out exactly what those numbers
are do you know the numbers internally I
have an estimate yeah but it's very
rough it's only been a few months that
we've been testing this out okay and how

[32:00]
we've been testing this out okay and how
does it look it's definitely an increase
we've seen stores that with the coupon
it could be anywhere from a 2% increase
in conversion all the way up to
10% and what is your hesitancy to
release that data just because it's you
have a small sample
size small sample size varying sample
size across stores there's a lot of
things that go into kind of the
effectiveness of coupons what have you
done to grow so far how have you gotten
these first users
we're like at a very interesting type of
growth I I can show
you something like
that oh wow okay is that mostly organic
it's all organic just yeah you publish
in the app store and just let it
go yeah running like some ads very minor
on the App Store and I just brought on
someone as a full-time marketing person
so just spinning up like social media
going full-time into content I think our

[33:00]
going full-time into content I think our
main play is going to be app
Partnerships from what I understand
seems to be working pretty well are you
able to AB test pricing I don't know how
it works on the back end on the App
Store but would you be able to run paid
ads towards your app with a price tag on
it to see how they might
perform yes to a degree that would like
compromise anything it would have to be
like you'd run a certain price for a
month and then change it and run another
price to be honest the Shopify App Store
architecture is not as great as people
make it out to be okay have you ever
thought of making your own Shopify
Facebook group like for Shopify store
owners I know a guy that has built a
Shopify app Crazy Fast and the way he
did it was by first starting a Facebook
group for Shopify store owners not
selling anything and then building his
product in public in the Facebook group
even though it's already built right hey
guys what do you think of this feature
what do you think of that feature and
he's the only admin so he can talk about
it as much or as little as he wants and

[34:00]
it as much or as little as he wants and
then over time it just becomes this very
organic marketing vehicle to drive uh
traffic to the app of people that feel
indebted to you I know it it sounds it's
harder than I'm making it out to be just
oh let's just create a Facebook group
and people will flock to it but a lot of
times if you find uh a category of
Facebook groups that's popular for
instance real estate find a subcategory
of that that seems to be underserved I
started a Facebook group a couple months
ago specifically for off-market RV park
deals there were a ton of Facebook
groups for Real Estate a handful of
Facebook groups for RV and mobile home
parks but nothing for off market and I
got this idea from my friend I can't
claim it but people just come in
organically and it's top of funnel so it
seems like you're using the app store
for top of funnel but what if you had
that downline a little bit and you had
some sort of a community that you could
push down the funnel to the App Store
yeah that's actually really interesting
do you think that this is something that

[35:01]
do you think that this is something that
would be promoted organically within the
group or is it something that's like
part of the group like this app is
sponsoring the group or whatever it is
it's really neither it's the admin
creator of the group just openly posts
about how the app is going so he's not
commenting on other posts and he's not
doing sponsored posts he's just talking
about building in oh we just had this
annoying customer that asked for a
refund yada yada yada and they just come
to know this app and then come to use it
I I also think that you should get on
the phone with your customers most
Shopify app store owners they don't
think to or they don't want to because
it's high friction but they will tell
you exactly what your app is lacking
whereas even if you have a feedback form
or I see you have great reviews if if
you get them on the phone give them an
Amazon gift card or something they will
get very specific on what they love
about it and what they don't love about
it one of the things that we noticed is
that there are are some compatibility
issues it doesn't necessarily have to be

[36:02]
issues it doesn't necessarily have to be
because of our app but for example like
there's other apps on Shopify that offer
functionality like quantity upsell so
they have a little thing where oh buy
three get 50% off or something like that
and what happens is a lot of those apps
just the way that they work they
actually o because our discount takes
place in the product page those
discounts usually take place in the C
page when they apply it it just
overwrites our discount so a lot of
times people come to us your app doesn't
work if that is a paino then I would
suggest doing exactly that building it
into your app if it's not too cumbersome
have you are you able to change your
pricing model or when you do introduce a
pricing model are you able to charge a
percentage of like savings or a
percentage of the yes but I'm hesitant
to do that because I've been reading
online like some people that have done
that and some customers get upset
because the the pricing isn't so clear

[37:00]
because the the pricing isn't so clear
up front so then they get the the bill
at the end of the month there's a lot of
apps that make a or that charge a lot
more money than you might think on the
surface because of the usage based um
pricing but if I were to suggest three
things I would suggest either
piggybacking onto some existing Facebook
groups for Shopify store owners or
starting your own and just getting it
going you can use builtwith to find a
list of Shopify stores to advertise them
to I would also suggest talking to your
users actually on the phone if possible
seeing ask them straight up would you
pay for this how much would you pay for
and you can even tell them like listen
be honest with me and I'll make this
free for life like I just want feedback
what would you pay for and I'll keep it
free for you the third thing I would do
is I would go ahead with your data that
shows your increase of conversion rate
and I would put that front and center on
your app store if you want to put an
asterisk on there fine but anytime you
present data there's a million wh ifs or
variables that could change the outcome

[38:00]
variables that could change the outcome
of that data and you can be as
transparent or as opaque as you want on
that but I think that would make a
really big difference because as a
Shopify store owner myself I want to
juice that conversion rate every bit
that I can and any tool that I can find
that will help me do that I want so I
would put that more front and center the
the third point that you mentioned with
advertising the conversion rate increase
how would you go about that would you
set that up as like a case study and
then present that to someone so they
have a reference to it or I'm just
trying to think of a way to do it that
people are not get going to get upset
like how can you claim this number like
where are you getting this information
from I don't think that's going to
happen I I think it would take a a large
amount of customers to be seeing that or
experiencing something contrary to what
you're stating for there to be someone
upset I think you're overthinking that I
think you should do a case study and
email that out to your current customers
and then take like the tldr of that case
study and put that front and center
makes

[39:00]
makes
sense but yeah I hope that's
helpful yeah no I really appreciate it I
guess in in your mind do you have any
feedback on the the app itself I think
it's a great idea it it reminds me of
when I we go to the grocery store we go
to HB and they have paper coupons in the
aisle and I'm just like what are you
doing but they know what they're doing
and my kid always rips all the the
coupons off whether or not we're buying
the item but it's just it's strategic
friction and the same thing but in real
life you grab the coupon and it's okay
now I need to take this somewhere and
hand it to somebody it's just a digital
version of that and I'm pretty shocked
that it didn't exist already so I I do
think that your idea has Merit and it
has legs I would be very hesitant to
hire a full-time marketer or to really
pour resources into it because I think
this is something that you could
bootstrap fairly cheaply so to what
degree do you think you could bootstrap
it I'm just curious just by doing these
three things by actually getting on the
phone yourself with these users
experimenting with the paid ads a little
more I just have maybe I'm too cheap I

[40:01]
more I just have maybe I'm too cheap I
just have a hard
time understanding what a full-time
marketer would do at this stage in the
process of your of your app I I feel
like you're too early along for that
full-time I would probably say full-time
employee part-time marketer but I the
main thing that I figured would be
really helpful with was our content so
being able to create YouTube videos to
explain our app and different
functionalities and social media posts
and stuff and then it turned out that we
actually had a big demand for bringing
on someone to help with customer support
because we're getting a lot of queries
and so it turned into more like a
full-time position and helping with with
that as well now with multiple roles
then yeah
basically okay that makes more sense
thanks for coming on let me know how
appreciate it man thank you so much for
your advice and I'll keep you posted how
how things go maybe we could reconnect
at some point okay sounds great thank

[41:01]
at some point okay sounds great thank
you love that thank you Christ take care
yep see
you Christian all right you've got a
unique problem let's hear about it yeah
pretty simple let's say for example
somebody followed me and I'm having like
people important people following me
let's say 50k followers 100K 150k and
I'm just wondering like some of them
want to pick my brain and and I'm just
wondering should I charge them a
Consulting call when should I do it when
should I not do it let me add some
context for people that are listening or
that will be listening that don't know
so you're talking about Twitter
specifically right like yes you have a a
Twitter account yep that that posts
business stuff we'll keep it broad right
you post interesting business stuff and
then people reach out and they're like
hey you seem smart I want to make money
doing what you're doing can you help me
and so you're asking like what do I do
with that do I charge sell my time do I

[42:01]
with that do I charge sell my time do I
sell a product do I sell a service is
that right absolutely yes I bet you get
tons of those yes yeah and where are you
where are you leaning today what do you
want to do if I can make money with the
Consulting calls I will but at the end
of the day I've helped a lot of people
by not not charging them but some of
them are sending to me 10 15 questions
in a DM I'm like dude I'm not going to
be able to answer all of this so you're
better off setting up a Consulting call
with me but I also don't want to be rude
that's my main question here I don't
want to be rude especially for those
that might find it as a rude answer if I
say that to them putting into
perspective that they have a bunch of
followers do yeah I don't want to come
across like a let's say like a bot B
head or something like that
yeah so I've dealt with the same problem
I think there's a way to to do it where

[43:00]
I think there's a way to to do it where
you're not rude I think that you should
have a copypaste kind of explainer
that's listen statistically speaking if
I said yes to the amount of people that
dm' me I would have no time to run my
actual business so I just can't and so I
think at that point you need to put them
through a filtering mechanism I've tried
several different things I've charged
for my time before and it's actually
shocking how few people are willing to
pay for your time yeah
I agree like when I started I charged
200 bucks for an hour or a half an hour
and this is this is high ticket stuff
like you could find out in an hour
exactly how to buy a mobile home park
that makes you six or seven figures but
PE like the conversion rate on that that
paid cenly is Tiny and so I eventually
took it off because I'm like I feel like
this does more harm than good like I'd
almost rather not do any of this than
make a few hundred here and there and
then I put it at ,200 $ per hour just to
weed everyone out and guess how many

[44:00]
weed everyone out and guess how many
people paid for that zero like not one
person has ever paid that which is
honestly fine because I don't like
hopping on these calls because it's it
doesn't seem efficient and I feel in
like I don't pay for Consulting calls so
I feel indebted to them and so I always
want to go over I always want to deliver
a ton of value and make sure they're
super super happy and it ends up being
fine but it's just it's it doesn't move
the needle much to to make
yeah it's not scalable either so I
totally agree with you so I think you
should do one of two things I think you
should you should create a course and I
say course but I really just mean a PDF
just take all your tweets that are
relevant upload it to chat GPT or do it
yourself or give it to your assistant
and have them just put it in a coherent
like an ebook right call it 3 to 5,000
words probably doesn't take that long go
to gumroad upload it to gumroad make it
20 bucks or 50 bucks or something and

[45:00]
20 bucks or 50 bucks or something and
just tell them hey just have a copy
paste listen if I were to say yes to
everyone I have no time like I I really
don't mean to be rude I just don't have
the time and so I put this together so
because I already know what you're G to
ask and this is going to answer 90% of
your questions go ahead and buy this if
you still have questions at that point
you can say I'll just hop on for free or
I'll charge for my time after that point
but most people aren't even willing to
pay 20 bucks they just want something
for free right yep even if they have a
lot of
followers I agree yes I think another
thing you could do which has been my
solution to this is you don't like
you've got to get people into an email
list or a free newsletter or something
just so you can touch base with them so
when you do sell something more High
ticket maybe that's you're fundraising
maybe you're selling an agency service
that's two grand a month when you do
sell that you don't have to go blast it
out there to everyone you can only tell
the people that you feel are the most

[46:01]
the people that you feel are the most
interested that gave you their email
months or years
prior okay so would you consider any
different approach to let's say someone
that is famous or an influencer or
something like that would you take any
different approach I would yeah I would
do it on a case-by casee basis okay
that's what I wanted to confirm yeah I
make exceptions all the time for this
like sometimes people reach out to me
that I look up to and admire and it's
dude I just want to talk to you like I
want to ask you questions and then it
becomes more of a a give and take
instead of just a take okay perfect hey
Chris thank you very much that's all I
wanted to confirm I had that idea in my
mind already I just wanted to peek your
brain you're very wise dude man thanks
man thanks for calling it was good
chatting with you I appreciate your time
thank you Chris take care Y no problem
by yep see you thank you for watching or
listening if you're live streaming right
