so I've always wanted to start a
restaurant but also I'm not an idiot so
I won't but I have a friend that's in
the restaurant industry that makes about
$230,000 a year in profit his startup
costs were about 15 grand and it is a
beautiful business so I'm going to tell
you what it is and how you can copy him
he has a smoker much like this one that
he pulls behind on his truck on a
trailer and he Parks it in a gas station
he pays the gas station owner about $700
a month which is nothing and he makes
thousands of dollars a day in Topline
sales selling brisket rig
sausage and chicken the margins on these
actually isn't that bad because this
chicken right here was A180 a pound for
Walmart best meat on the planet and I
brind it to make it way more and you can
sell it for $10 to2 a pound even more if
you put it on a bun and turn it into a
sandwich so if you like the restaurant
business buy a smoker learn how to do it
Go negotiate a lease on a gas station
and you're in business follow me for
more business ideas like these
