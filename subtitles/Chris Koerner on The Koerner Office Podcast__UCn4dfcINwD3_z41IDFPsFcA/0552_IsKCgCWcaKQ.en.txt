I don't think I could love this stupid
idea anymore this guy freaking vacuums
dogs he takes their hair he turns it
into yarn and then he crochets that into
stuff I'm sorry but any business idea
centered around people spending too much
money on their dumb pets is probably a
good idea there's a framework for you
day 24 of Genius business ideas follow
for more now I don't recommend you learn
how to crochet or vacuum dogs but you
could certainly sell a kit that has all
of these items in one package or you
could have a little popup shop at a flea
market what's rent at a flea market $100
for a Saturday have a little pop-up shop
people are walking around with their
dogs say hey let me freaking vacuum that
dog real quick vacuum the dog charge him
100 bucks mail him a scarf in a month
now are you going to get enough hair off
a dog at a farmers market after
vacuuming it for 10 minutes to make a
scarf of course not but every good idea
starts with a bad idea will that idea
work I don't know but it might it's
better than being in a job you hate
isn't it full business plan right here
