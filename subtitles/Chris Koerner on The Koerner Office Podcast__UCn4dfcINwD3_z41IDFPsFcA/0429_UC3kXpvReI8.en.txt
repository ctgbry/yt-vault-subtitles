look at this freaking lady right here
you know those 6ot plastic folding
tables that you see everywhere you go
they're like 80 bucks well this mom
wanted to use one but thought they
looked pretty ugly so she made a nice
overlay out of plywood whatever to go
over it to make it look more like a
regular table now I don't know if you
already follow me or if you've seen
these videos of mine before but my whole
job is to take really cool ideas and try
to show you how they could be business
ideas because my tagline is any good
idea can be a good business idea but the
more I looked at this video and thought
about it I don't think this is a good
idea I'm sorry I think this is why
tablecloths were invented no shade to
this Mom it looks like a fun project
table looks gorgeous but this is one of
the few times where I rack my brain
thinking how do I monetize this and I
just don't know I just don't know we
can't all bat a thousand right so if you
want good ideas then follow me for those
