[00:00]
okay so we talk about chat GPT rappers
on this podcast quite a bit and a GPT
rapper is basically a business that you
build on top of chat GPT a lot of people
crap on it but people are building
really big businesses on top of chat GPT
and so instead of talking about it
theoretically today I wanted to invite
someone on the podcast that actually did
it he built a rapper he's growing super
fast he's an AI voice rapper selling to
small businesses local businesses Home
Service businesses and I wanted to ask
him no holds bar like how is this how
did it go how is it going is this hard
is this a should other people do it what
markets would you attack if you were
doing this all over again what ideas
would you give other people specific
business ideas or launch tactics you're
going to love it is with the owner of a
business called hey Rosie please share
with a
[Music]
friend well why don't we start by you
just telling us who you are and what you
do cool Chris first thanks for having me
on I'm a fan of the Pod and your Twitter
and it's great to be on yeah you want to
talk about Rosie it's a new business we
started about 6 months ago and what it
does is it answers theone for small

[01:01]
does is it answers theone for small
businesses it's an AI agent that does a
much better job than voicemail it costs
a fraction of what an answering service
does and it handles this very painful
issue that small business owners have
which is phone calls during the day
while they're working phone calls after
hours when they're closed just how to
handle the phone when you are an owner
operator or you're relying on people and
the phone matters to you in your
business that's that's what we're doing
I've honestly been surprised at how
expensive a lot of these like
traditional phone answering services are
it's it's never made sense for me as a
business owner one of the exciting
things about AI is it creates markets
that weren't possible and as a business
owner that relies on the phone you
really kind of had voicemail as one
option and then the answering service as
another and it is surprising it's like
two bucks a minute is is like a normal
rate for an answering service and that's
only worth it if each call is extremely
high Roi or it is built into the service

[02:02]
high Roi or it is built into the service
that you promised people and you charge
for and I've been on both sides of those
calls I've I've called like my septic
guy and it went to the answering service
and like I feel like their knowledge
base is so limited it's like I my
sprinkler and they're like and it's like
really you can't answer this whereas AI
is just like upload PDFs answer
questions obviously I'm oversimplifying
it but yeah but well you're touching on
something which is you know if you rely
on human memory and skill an answering
service does a very difficult time
keeping it affordable because they might
have 10 20 30 50 people answer in the
phone based on the time and day and not
everyone has the same context yeah so or
you go the other way you hire someone
inhouse or you're sophisticated enough
to hire someone in the Philippines or
something like that then you train them
up and then they have the knowledge in
their head and if they're not available
or if maybe they go take another job or
something then you kind of have to
restart and like you said AI addresses a
lot of those concerns with you know
memory that doesn't go away people that

[03:02]
memory that doesn't go away people that
don't leave for other jobs so yeah yeah
it could be better in that way it's
funny because I'm actually smiling at
I'm remembering I tweet I don't know if
you saw this tweet it was just last week
I had some guy come to fix my dryer and
then he steps through my ceiling and so
I call the number and immediately I know
like if I weren't a business owner I
probably wouldn't know but immediately I
know all right this is someone in the
Philippines she probably has like six
questions she gets every day and this is
definitely not one of the six she's not
going to know what to do like just knew
from the first jump and this seems like
just a perfect use case for AI right you
know one of the reasons I was drawn to
it is because it actually when we looked
at it roughly six months ago it was in
its infancy meaning it wasn't actually
that good but anything around AI that is
currently not good you have a lot of
confidence in it getting good and then
really good in the future so like what
you're alluding to we would probably do
a decent job at addressing not a very

[04:02]
a decent job at addressing not a very
good job because we're not actually a
human replacement we're a much better
voicemail much better conversion rate
than voicemail everyone hates voicemail
it is on its way to human level skill
and memory and that sort of thing right
now it's in it's in between phase and
it's going in that direction and that's
we think a lot about that the way we
talk about it is it it's transitioning
from an answering service to a
receptionist so in between those two
tell me what like a perfect use case is
for Rosie so like let's say you you own
a $5 million HVAC business would that be
a likely customer of yours and what
would a normal call look like for them
yeah Le let's let's talk about two types
of customers one I have in mind is a is
is a water remediation company right so
that's the use case that you're talking
about they do millions of dollars in
revenue and sometimes at 10:00 at night
a hospital will have a water issue and
they're calling this business and that's

[05:00]
they're calling this business and that's
like a million dooll job but it's 10:00
at night and right now they have an
answering service and that answering
service is expensive and is in a similar
situation as you described earlier you
don't know who's going to pick up the
phone and sometimes they're keeping
those that call like on hold for like 10
12 minutes and that's just unacceptable
so in that situation they've come to us
and said we love what you're doing we
can train her great what we need now is
call transfers we need a split in the
road this is just a regular call take
the message this is a really important
call we need you to transfer it to us
and do not hang up until someone has
picked up so try line number one for
Billy try L line number two for Jack so
it's programmable conversation so you
Bas all that functionality is code you
can say don't you know transfer
depending on what timee of day and which
day transfer to this person so that's
the use case of that type of business

[06:00]
the use case of that type of business
the other type of business is like a one
or twers company and that I I think is
like emotionally What drew me to this
and that I always describe as Saturday
morning you're having breakfast with
your kids phone rings you do not know if
you should pick up the phone what that
phone call is is it a $33,000 you know
concrete job that it really matters to
you and your family is it spam you're
with your family so this that choice is
very painful and addressing that pain
feels amazing so Rosie will pick up the
phone the business has the ability to
identify what they consider to be a
successful message right are you an
existing customer what town do you live
in what do you you know what kind of
work you're looking for and then it'll
just send them a text message with a
transcript and a summary of that call
and then that person can decide I'm
going to stop what I'm doing right now
with my family because this is important
or I'm going to ignore it until Monday
so what is the voice saying is like hey
you know this is so and so can I take

[07:01]
you know this is so and so can I take
your info and we'll have is it saying up
front this is AI or if it doesn't and
they ask how does it respond I'm very
curious about those awkward interactions
it felt like a strategic question
whether or not this tries to pretend to
be human or if it just has no problem
just address yes I'm an AI we give the
we give the user the option some
businesses want to say hi I'm Rosie the
AI receptionist for Chris's business how
can I help you and other people just
want to gloss over it and hope that the
people don't care what do you think is
best I think it depends on the audience
and and the demographic I listen to a
lot of calls some people have no idea
they're talking to an AI some people get
a kick out of it some people like are
are upset about it and then they kind of
realize oh this is actually me like
interacting with the voicemail in some
ways and I just assume it's early so a
year from now two years from now the
truth is this kind of has the potential
to alleviate a lot of pain from both the
caller side and the business side yeah

[08:01]
caller side and the business side yeah
yeah yeah because it's easy to look at
this as being a big convenience or a
costs saer for the business but as a
consumer like I would rather just have
someone like binarily answer my
questions like just answer my dang
questions don't transfer me don't put me
on hold even if I knew it was an an AI I
would much prefer that it just seems
like a win-win all the way around right
and then there are some cases that you
do need a human and for that the AI goes
out and tells the people hey you got to
call this person back
we even had people a large national gym
franchise what they said to us was all
of our users would prefer text message
can you just say at the beginning do you
want to turn this into a text message
conversation if so I'll send you a text
so that's that's kind of on the way
because it puts more power in the
caller's hands on how they want to
interact so that's a feature you're
adding based on that feedback yeah
interesting that that's a really cool
idea right it's just like oh I have to
call to what to like set set an
appointment or cancel something or ask

[09:02]
appointment or cancel something or ask
you know whatever it is if you prefer
text then you just don't need to
interact on on the thumb do you have any
funny stories about awkward interactions
that you listen to or where it went off
the rails or in your early days I I
think that's daily you know it's yeah
it's not perfect one of the very like
relieving
experiences is understanding that it's
such a painful problem that the product
actually doesn't need to be perfect it
needs to really good and consistent but
not 100% perfect it's challenging from a
development point of view because you
know there's software and you can kind
of like set things up to tell you where
there are errors this type of thing
because it's voice you really kind of
have to listen to the conversations to
see where things go wrong and what you
need to adjust and then you have to wait
for the next phone call yeah and then
see what settings led into what
interaction yeah but there's like
there's funny stuff all the time you
know every once in a while show
like leak in some funny thing or she'll

[10:02]
like leak in some funny thing or she'll
repeat herself three times I mean like I
said it's software and there's plenty of
work to be done but the reliability is
what matters now I'm sure you're white
labeling something that actually handles
the heavy Tech of this is are there
still pauses are there awkward pauses
and has that gotten better the
Improvement on latency is probably the
biggest Improvement since we started you
would make a call and you would kind of
cringe like oh my God no nobody Waits
two seconds to respond that is so much
better just a few months and you know I
I I I hope we get a chance I'll I'll
like call Rosie during this podcast so
we can see and and you'll notice that
the latency is very natural very very
okay well I'll just I'll let the demo
answer that question fully for me Co
I've seen your bio you remind me of
myself and that you're a Serial
entrepreneur you've done a lot of things
when you know with everything at your
disposal not just like across any
industry but in AI specific specifically
of all the things you could have chosen

[11:01]
of all the things you could have chosen
what made you want to tackle this
problem of all things okay so I go
toward the customer meaning uh I want to
live at the app layer where end
customers interact I don't want to sell
to developers so that automatically drew
me to that basically uh a rapper
business and people talk a lot of trash
about rappers I think they change your
tune a little bit with deep seek coming
out because you start to look at the
really really hard tech that might get
commoditized so I always want to sell to
the End customer so that immediately
drew me there the way this business came
about is I was actually running another
business called rally which is an
e-commerce checkout that we've raised
money for and it was just going okay but
it wasn't fun it had an Enterprise sales
process it wasn't grown quickly enough
so I was open to pivoting I mean I'll be
honest with you what I did was I went to
YC's uh website and they do a great job
of listing other companies and I looked

[12:01]
of listing other companies and I looked
at the most recent batch and I start
going through AI ideas and I wanted
something one that was worth money like
to the customer like if you do this for
me I get Roi from giving you money every
month and I wanted something that was
not good so voice felt like this thing
that was going to become very good but
at the moment was not good and I wanted
a big Market that I could sell self-
serve I did not want to do the
Enterprise sales process so I had like
some criteria when I looked at it and it
this just kind of hit the bullseye for
me what a a beautiful framework is just
going to the for those aren't familiar
YC is y combinator it's the most
prestigious startup incubator in the
world by far nothing's even close I've
never even thought like I've heard of
people doing that I know they post like
what they're investing in what they're
looking for but I don't know maybe
because I have too many ideas like I'm
never short on like what to do you know
but a lot of people are not I'm not even

[13:00]
but a lot of people are not I'm not even
saying that you were but you were very
strategic about what to launch and
that's honestly refreshing to hear
because usually the story that I hear is
like you know I had this problem and I I
solved it for myself then other people
asked and they kind of serendipitously
fall into it which is great but like I
just love that this is different and
it's like I was tactical I looked at
this what is a problem what's a huge
Market what is Silicon Valley putting
their money into what do I know what are
my Frameworks I want to sell to the
consumer I don't want Enterprise SASS
and you just kind of baked a cake that
looks like Rosie you know I appreciate
you putting it that
way yes that you can look at it that way
right the the other point of view was
like oh you went and copied someone but
not not really no I love even if yes I
love copying people IOP great no
sh what I liked you alluded to it before
you said I bet you not really doing the
hard tech yourselves you're building on
top of existing stuff so what I actually
found and I went to see was not

[14:00]
found and I went to see was not
companies like Rosie I found the
infrastructure companies that were
effectively marketing to companies like
Rosie saying build your stuff on top of
our
texting and and that I think is really
interesting in AI because you're
building a lot less than you used to so
rally we build so much like we still had
stripe to build on top of but you had to
build so much of the stack and AI allows
you to leverage amazing Tech and you
really are just building the interaction
layer on top uh which I think is why
very technical people you know talk down
to rappers but regular lay People Like
Us who understand how big the market is
for just normal businesses who have
problems who don't care what model we're
using or transcriber or anything else
they just want the problem solved
there's a huge like Arbitrage
opportunity in AI for people like us to
just grab the TCH Tech and sell it

[15:00]
just grab the TCH Tech and sell it
you're almost reselling the tech but you
are solving problems you're not just
taking the tech and handing it over yes
a lot of people can go out and build
their own voice agents nobody wants to
do that you're running a you know $20
million window company yeah I mean I
think what is air was one of them is it
air dot I started playing around with
that right when it came out and I was
like floored my mind was blown I was
uploading thousands of phone numbers I
was calling people they had hilarious
conversations I was trolling people it
was just like I can't believe this is
real so like that probably puts me in
the like the top tier of people that
know that these things exist and how to
use them but even me I also own a tree
trimming business if we were to hire you
know a call service it would be
something like this because I don't want
to mess with it like just because you
know how to use it doesn't mean you're
not going to pay a rapper you know yep
yep I had a lot of fun with specifically
around the experience with Enterprise
sales I really didn't like that version
of things I I wanted it to be more
straightforward not you say yes in this
meeting but there's actually someone

[16:00]
meeting but there's actually someone
else that decides we got to have another
meeting there and so what I said to the
team was prepare this to take on 100
signups a day okay we're not there yet
we're making our way there but if you if
you set that out as a requirement for a
piece of software it forces you into a
bunch of decisions around how complex
how sophisticated who's it for how how
much you're describing it how many
options you're giving right so in the
spectrum of ease of use to
complexity it tells you where you want
to be so Rosie is very much that there
are much more sophisticated Solutions
this is not that if you are some Airline
and you need to replace it with AI we
are not for you if you're a restaurant
go to slang AI they're building it for
restaurants if you are a business owner
that wants to come in and 20 minutes
later be launched that's what that's
what we're for yeah yeah just such an
interesting framework is like there's

[17:01]
interesting framework is like there's
like rappers on rappers right like slang
at like you could do that you could be
you could sell the restaurants right
like it's just it I'm oversimplifying
it's a different prompt but it's like no
no no like restaurants want to buy you
know call services for restaurants yes
yeah I just turned someone down I like
hey you know it's a kind of decent
opportunity too 2,000 minutes all this
stuff but they want integration with
their POs to take orders yeah so that's
amazing but we're not going to do that
anytime soon
yeah yeah okay so let's talk unit
economics what does what does 2,000
minutes look like to you on like a gross
revenue and net margin perspective Okay
cool so I I love pricing and positioning
so I'm happy to dive all the way into
this stuff one of the downsides with AI
at least with voice AI is that the gross
margin is not as good as other software
companies like the the cogs is is
serious like it's you're paying per
minute you're selling per minute we
don't want to sell per minute we want to
sell s based on features but as of right

[18:01]
sell s based on features but as of right
now you go to our website right it's 250
minutes is 49 bucks a month with the
features come with it 99 bucks a month
for for 500 so it's about 20 cents a
minute uhuh now in my previous software
companies like one card hook that was
really successful we were probably
spending 5,000 bucks a month on AWS and
doing $500,000 in Revenue that that's
what gross margin normally looks like
the software company so video is cool
but you know what's better long form
audio via podcast and my newsletter TKO
pod.com go there to subscribe for free
to my newsletter it's one email a week
very tactical and then go to my audio
podcast three episodes a week stuff like
this you're gonna love it all free no
sleazy sales TKO pod.com so in AI
the challenge is you cannot B price
based on your cogs because you will get
smoked yeah because cogs goes down so
fast that you need to price with the
Assumption of where cogs will be in the
future and so you kind of need to eat
the bad margins now to enjoy the good

[19:01]
the bad margins now to enjoy the good
margins later I was just pricing out per
minute for voice calling and it was like
it's not it's wasn't great it was like
15 13 cents and so when we're talking
what you're charging like that might
sound good on the surface but for
software with software type cost that's
not great that's right that's right so
when we first launched we didn't have
differentiation in features among the
plans cuz we were just starting and now
as we add things like appointment
setting and transfers and live transfers
and spam detection and custom agent
training and training files that is what
we're using to differentiate among the
plans because if we're viewed as a set
number of minutes for the price you pay
we're seen as a commodity yeah then I'm
just going to compare to this other
service and you don't you don't want to
be in the commodity game so that that's
our challenge over the next few months
we've started but over the next few
months we want to deemphasize the number
of minutes because that actually doesn't

[20:00]
of minutes because that actually doesn't
map to the type of business if I'm a one
two or three person company I I just
need the simple features just take the
messages for me let me know and that's
it and if I'm the water remediation
company I need the higher plan because
you got all the stuff that I need not
just the number of minutes yeah and also
when it comes to pricing is you always
play that trade-off between like
friction and simplicity because most
business owners are like what is 2,000
minutes I don't know how many minutes I
need like that equals friction that
equals I'm going to go somewhere else
where it's 50 bucks a month and that
just gets what I need and you're like
okay but you know 50 I could lose my
shirt on that you know but the more
you're you're in the game the more you
realize okay this guy he's gonna be this
guy he's gonna be I might lose money on
5% of these guys but you make the
pricing more simple because you you
gather more data to be able to afford to
do that yes I like I knew we needed to
start moving away from deemphasizing
minutes when we got the comment more
than once do my minutes roll over like
now you're in the cell phone game bad
you know bad place to be I want it to be
commodity you're setting yes you're
setting appointments for me that's worth

[21:01]
setting appointments for me that's worth
99 compared to the 49 plan that you just
take in messages
yeah what types of businesses or
Industries are you on boarding that
really surprise you like that always
happens right you're like all right
we're going to be you know hfac Plumbing
electrical that's those are the big
three we're going to do that and then
it's like wow all these Landscaping
businesses keep calling us what and then
you learn like oh because in landscaping
I did you know yes tell me about that I
love that process in business like you
just uncovering what the actual issues
are on the other side so going in our
assumption was that the most important
category was going to be home services
and that's because they're advertising
and phone calls come in you know I own a
home I'm in like the Chicago BBS I do my
research online and then I pick up the
phone and I call these people and that's
how a lot of people make their decision
so that's that was our assumption that
was mostly right it's about 50% Home
Services okay the other 50% is a wild
west small business American

[22:00]
west small business American
entrepreneurial landscape it is Property
Management party events just local
businesses but not home service local
businesses but not home service it's
basically anyone that has the phone
still playing a large role in their
business yeah have you ever thought
about scraping uh Google Maps and and
then scrubbing out all of the landlines
and marketing specifically to the ones
with where the owner has their cell
phone
unlisted yes so I've thought one of the
things I like most about your content is
it reminds me of technical hacking I'm
not an engineer but I know people who
hack you look at it from a business hack
point of view so that that would be one
of them right so one of the things we
wanted to do may maybe we'll figure out
a way to do it was basically call local
numbers scraped off of Google Maps or
Google Business profiles after hours so
based on time zone and anyone that went
to voicemail was a perfect candid you

[23:01]
to voicemail was a perfect candid you
could actually drop a voicemail saying
hi I'm Rosie I'm the AI eat your own dog
food use your own software to do this
yes yes so we haven't done that yet
right now we're advertising which is
super interesting and of itself B2B I've
never really succeeded advertising with
B2B I've always done like this
networking thing and content and all
this other stuff right now ads on
Instagram Facebook Tik Tok which I think
speaks to the fact that there's so many
small business owners and people
involved in small business you can kind
of just blast it out there and let the
algorithm go find them but we're just
speaking to a very general paino you
know I hate getting to the office on
Monday and seeing 14 Miss calls and no
one left a message right that's just a
common paino so I think that's related
to what you asked about like a
category normally if I started a
software company I would go for a very
specific category a niche and nail it
for them and expand from there in this

[24:01]
for them and expand from there in this
case in AI in general I think the broad
approach makes more sense because the
markets are just forming every business
owner a lot of people have this phone
problem there aren't many very large
problems in the economy that don't have
any
solutions you know capitalism is better
than that yeah this stuff AI creates
these new categories because you
couldn't do this a year ago so voicemail
and answering Services were the only
option that creates a third option in a
very large Market with a very large
problem I don't think it makes sense to
Niche down I think you got to go Broad
and and capitalize on the wave uh of new
businesses looking for this yeah agreed
so one question I'd love to ask is for
anyone listening a lot you know 30% of
people that listen to this 30 to 40% are
business owners and 50 to 60% are
aspiring business owners so if someone's
an aspiring business owner and they're
like I want to build a rapper what
advice would you give them that's part

[25:00]
advice would you give them that's part
one of the question part two is what
opportunities are you seeing that you're
too focused on Rosie to execute on like
man someone really needs to do this
because I got this call from this
plumber that like what are you seeing
that other people could go launch or
start let's start with that second
question I'm pretty focused on voice
with AI and there are a lot of
opportunities around voice that aren't
what we're doing so one of the one of
the things I think is most uh huge
opportunity it's basically coaching but
it's it's AI sales
coaching so you and I are doing a
podcast you've probably been on Zoom
calls before and there's like a
transcriber an AI along with you those
are really good I've used one called
fathom it's ridiculously good yes if you
layer that on top of sales conversations
it starts to become worth a lot of money
one of the other ideas that I considered
and looked into before pursuing Rosie
was basically a ridealong sales manager

[26:01]
was basically a ridealong sales manager
that just listened to either calls or
in-house so think about a pest control
salesman going door too recording the
conversation they have at the door
because the owner has no idea what he's
saying the owner of this pest control
company like and I used to do pest
control and I worked with sales guys and
like they could be misrepresenting the
company without even knowing it they
could have terrible sales technique they
they could just be breaking every rule
in the book and the owner would never
know that's right you you are not there
you are not part of that conversation
and you know a lot of people who want to
go from I do all the sales myself to I
want people they have trust issues you
try how do I train people properly so I
think that is a huge opportunity you
could do it on the phone and on Zoom you
could also do it in person you an iPhone
app and start an iPhone app and then
basically take the transcriptions of
those conversations and start to talk to
the owners and say what needs to be said
how do you want it to close are they
representing the company properly are
they saying the tag you know the the

[27:01]
they saying the tag you know the the
lines that you want them to say and you
could even have it like anonymize
specifics so you could tell the sales
guys listen don't be afraid of this it's
not going to I'm not going to see
transcripts of what you're saying it's
just going to send me notes like you
know he really could have you know
before he left he really could have
upsold them a little bit on this or that
or else it might be hard to get Buy in
from the sales guys but are you familiar
with rewind and that pendant that
they're launching yes yes yeah so I
pre-ordered one of those but that's more
consumer FOC but it's interesting yeah
yeah but it's like a it's a very small
wearable that will enable conversations
like this that where they don't have to
be on your phone so it's gonna be
interesting to see how new hardware can
enable new rappers or new businesses on
top of that Hardware True the first
question was what just advice yeah like
just advice on launching a rapper in
general like because I over simplied a
lot on this podcast that's like my
biggest complaint which I won't
apologize for that because that gets
people to launch things right yep that's
right but we talk good yeah we'll start
rapper for this I'm going to launch a
rapper for that and what is your maybe

[28:02]
rapper for that and what is your maybe
pessimistic take on that or slap of
reality on that if there is one at all
there's both sides the the realistic you
know cold water on it is that it's still
hard just because it's a rapper doesn't
mean it's easy software's hard product
Market fit is elusive you have to go
into it knowing yes point of view the
rapper approach gets you places
faster but mhm it's not a Panacea you
still need to do the hard work now the
the other side of that the optimistic
side of that is if you pay attention to
the solution and not the tech don't get
enamored with the tech just because this
new thing came out you can do it just
because it's cool that that's not what
you should be following if you can
identify the actual problem and then
connect the two oh there's now this Tech
that I can build a rapper on top of that
addresses this I think that that's the
way to go that's the key advice is don't
get enamored with the tech get enamored

[29:01]
get enamored with the tech get enamored
with the problem and the solution and
you see people doing that really
successfully with like these rapper
iPhone apps it's like dating stuff Bible
study enables things that weren't
possible and then you can wrap up into
something that's very popular there's
already a big market for and you can
jump in what do you think about that
specifically building iPhone app rappers
like a Sourdough cooking guide I
experienced that I think the same way as
other aspiring entrepreneurs you look
over and there's a lot of Twitter posts
about how much money they're making and
how EAS it looks and then it goes
through your like emotional you know
roller coaster of all I of
disillusionment yes so I feel like maybe
I've gone through that enough times to
be like oh that's just the shiny object
I'm not going to pursue that I I think
there's an interesting Market there I
just don't know the Apple App Store game
at all yeah and one of the key
characteristic ICS that we didn't touch
on going into Rosie was I did not want

[30:01]
on going into Rosie was I did not want
to be beholden to a larger
platform my card hook that company I
alluded to before Shopify yep yep it got
to like six million in ARS like it
wasn't bootstrap just a few bucks from
friends and family it's beautiful
business 20 people having fun and
Shopify just didn't want it to exist so
they nuked it and I just didn't want to
be in that position anymore so Rosie
specifically one of the key
characteristics was you know out in the
open market okay so you're 6 months in
what are your numbers looking like today
how was your churn what is your customer
acis acquisition cost Revenue what does
that all look like that you're willing
to share yeah I I can talk about
customer acquisition cost and then I'll
be fuzzy on revenue and stuff sure
customer acquisition cost is obviously
important we've gotten to about 50 bucks
which is really interesting and in
software you you know what you do is you
take that and then you apply your
conversion rate your trial to paid
conversion and then you look at your
churn and then you know all that you get
your payback period how many months it

[31:00]
your payback period how many months it
takes you to get payback for your
advertising your CAC all that stuff it's
not that the numbers don't matter to me
right now the most important thing is
that there is a pull in the market and
people want it to work you can you can
sense it you're not pushing you're not
selling anything people are coming us
saying I want this help me how do I if
this works this will be a game changer
you probably hear that a lot right yes
so so that that is what really drives us
churn when I made my projections for the
year I put churn very high I thought AI
product voice non-technical customers I
was like ch's going to be like 20% of
it's going to be a mess for a while
until it gets good and we have been
shocked at how low it is it's low single
digits and the reason for that what we
didn't appreciate is how painful this
problem is and so because it's so
painful if you solve it they'll wait

[32:00]
painful if you solve it they'll wait
okay it'll get better okay I understand
this thing got messed up I I don't care
You' have solved this problem for me and
I do not want to go back to the way it
was so that's important but we have been
we have been doubling every month for
the last few months so it is flying
right now feels amazing awesome it's
like I'm looking at a vent diagram in my
head of everything you've got going
right massive Market massive problem
you've got to have a beautiful product
and in this case the UI and the features
you know are what primarily make that up
and then you have to acquire customers
and if you have a great product then
you'll keep the customers if it's a a
pain a painkiller not a vitamin which is
this seems to be then you'll have demand
and the market is huge you've got 30
million small business owners in America
alone the the DNA feels great and a
growing Market really papers over a lot
of problems and a lot of mistakes
speaking of UI maybe that's a good
transition to like let's do it show you
this thing yeah just getting there so

[33:02]
this thing yeah just getting there so
we're going to take a little risk we're
going to go live we're going to set up a
Rosie agent I'm going to share my screen
we'll go through the onboarding and
we'll just kind of you know experience
it and then feel free to ask questions
but we're just going to go from where we
are right now to being able to call the
agent we'll see we'll see how long that
takes okay let me share my screen here
you said you can do Spanish as well
right like if it detects Spanish it will
speak in Spanish yes that's right so it
can switch I don't speak Spanish very
well but yeah but it understands that
was like that was the most important
language right we're focused in the US
market yeah and that works now so it's a
trip to hear her just like flip and just
go into Spanish or flip back that's
crazy all right cool so we're looking at
our website so what we did here which
was I think really important is we
started adding value before they created
an account so if you're on the heyr
roy.com webbsite you click and the first
thing you see here is like putting your

[34:00]
thing you see here is like putting your
business name into to find your Google
business profile that's cool right so
I'm going to do pest Busters right it's
like a pest control company here in the
suburbs all right I found it on Google
business profile and I hit continue and
I see yes that's my logo that's the
information and I hit yes train so this
is what few
seconds so under 10 seconds we are
giving them some value so what's
happening on the back end here so we
have scraped their Google business
profile
listing and created their own agent so
now let's click on it hello thank you
for calling pest Busters pest control my
name is Rosie how can I help you today
right so we wanted them to go from
homepage to putting in their information
to hearing their own business name
spoken by an AI agent in 10 seconds
that's so cool only then do we ask them
to create an account right we've kind of
proven to them no this is legit and it's

[35:00]
proven to them no this is legit and it's
fast and you'll you'll get what you want
quickly so let's hit claim my agent and
now let's just grab a password real
quick and we'll do Jordan
plus password and then
claim okay and now we go another step
further we scrape the rest of their
website we scrape the rest of their
information and we just built their
agent on the Fly mhm so as you get in
here you see this is the training
sources your website and your Google
business profile it has pulled in what
you do your location your phone number
your core services and then it can take
a message so let's do this uh we're g to
add a question that we want Rosie to ask
when she takes a message so are you an
existing
customer question mark
okay and then we have email

[36:00]
okay and then we have email
notifications and SMS whenever a call
comes in it'll it'll notify you and then
let's just click talk to Rosie and
that's it we're we are here we now have
an AI agent for this business and now we
got to give it a call 2 two
three all right let's
listen hello thank you for calling pest
Busters Pest Control our call may be
recorded today for control purposes my
name is Rosie how can I help you hey
Rosie can I leave a message for the team
of course can I get your first and last
name sure it's Jordan and last name is G
thanks Jordan are you an existing
customer with us yes I am all right so
I'll hang up and stop sharing so that's
it that's cool right that's we wanted a
small business owner that isn't
technical to just get there yeah that's
amazing did I hear like talking going on
in the background or was that something
else yes that is an option if you want

[37:01]
else yes that is an option if you want
it to sound like an office setting with
like background noise you can keep that
or you can just oh that is so cool yeah
the playing around with like engineering
like programming features with like
human interaction is fun like the can
you speak Spanish and she just flips and
starts talking Spanish it there's
something more tactile than just
interacting with a screen and a mouse
and a keyboard it's been fun yeah like
I'm just thinking of
are you able to do male voices as well
right now we just have one voice I
thought people were over optimizing for
that so if you go to some more
competitors it's like 50 different
voices yeah fature creep that people
aren't asking for yes people are like
can I get XYZ and we'll do that you know
sometime over the next month or two
we'll still keep it in our style We'll
add two or three voices you know a few
male few female that's it I was just
thinking it would be cool if like if you
called and it was like a Gruff male
voice and you could it sounded like he
was driving
hey this is Jim Jim's Plumbing how can I

[38:00]
hey this is Jim Jim's Plumbing how can I
help you like that would just be so real
it should match the personality of the
business some are more formal some are
more blue color so so that will
eventually be right now you can change
their name and you could go you could
change the tone casual professional and
so on yeah there's a lot of like fun
settings but it's very easy so actually
this goes back to the rapper business
mindset underneath our Tech are a lot
more op than we're showing it it's
almost like that distillation of what
actually matters is part of our value ad
it's not just revealing all the features
yeah I I once heard this stated a lot
more beautifully than I'm about to say
but it's like it reminds me of Airbnb
it's a design first company and a
beautifully designed company is that
there's a lot of complexity happens
there's a lot of complexity happening
that the user has no idea about right it
it appears simple but it's not simple
like that's the perfect balance yes yes
and you have an amazing opportunity when
you work with non-technical people to

[39:01]
you work with non-technical people to
give them the it just works experience
and they're very grateful for that as
opposed to you know having to do a bunch
of stuff and go through what looks like
fancy layers but it's really just
getting in the way of what they're
trying to accomplish that's amazing well
