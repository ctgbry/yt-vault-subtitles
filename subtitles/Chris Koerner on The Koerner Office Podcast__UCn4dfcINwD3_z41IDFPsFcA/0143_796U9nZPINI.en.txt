[00:00]
oh and Ohio is also interesting because
it has three four five cities that are
like midsize by midsize I consider to be
2 to 400,000 people so Columbus is the
biggest and then you've got Cincinnati
Cleveland Toledo Dayton okay so we are
going to be looking at six cities three
within Ohio and three outside of Ohio
but in neighboring is states and cities
of comparable sizes and so we're going
to look at Cleveland Cincinnati and
Toledo all of those have between two and
400,000 people and then we're going to
look at Madison Wisconsin Grand Rapids
Michigan
and Fort Wayne Indiana okay and I'm
going to show you all this data and why
I thought to pull up this data so I'm
not going to look at the YouTube
questions that often because it gets
pretty distracting so I'm just going to
roll with it I'm going to talk a ton and
then I'm going to pause look at
questions answer them as best I can and
then keep going okay so we are tring to

[01:00]
then keep going okay so we are tring to
validate if starting from scratch a
dumpster rental business in one of these
three Ohio cities is viable okay maybe
you live in Cleveland and you want to
measure um Cincinnati and Toledo maybe
you're saying hey I'm going to move to
any of those three cities because I'm
going all in on this business and I want
to pick the one that's best This
research will fit both of those
scenarios and they will fit any state
and any home service industry so just
copy and paste okay um all right I'm
going to look at some questions real
quick and then I will share my screen
all right here's what we're doing so
here's the poll this what I was talking
about okay cool just for proof I'm not
trying to lead everyone towards dumpster
rental I have no affiliation with any
dumpster rental business I just like
every time I tweet about it people love
it and it's hot right now for whatever
reason which probably means it's going
to be pretty saturated in a year or two
so I'm going to close that window I'm
going to go to this Google sheet that I
have so this is the Google sheet that I
started putting together and let's go
ahead and bold the cities in

[02:02]
ahead and bold the cities in
Ohio and then the unbold cities are
outside of Ohio but in nearby States so
these are the cities these are the
populations uh this is the percentage
real estate growth now I use chat GPT
for most of this so I don't know if this
is over the last decade or what but I
wanted to look at real estate growth
because I in my opinion that's going to
correlate with how well Home Service
businesses do in the area I also want to
look at the economic growth in that City
I also want to look at the average home
value because that's going to dictate
how much you can charge and then right
here oh I think I accidentally hid uh
iow let me unhide that all right average
household income home ownership rate and
this really surprised me and I double
checked it to be sure Fort Wayne Indiana
has a 66% home ownership rate apparently
the the Nationwide average is closer to
65% so I don't know I'm surprised by how

[03:00]
65% so I don't know I'm surprised by how
many of these are low and then I want a
zip code for each area just for
convenience because I'm going to be
using those zip codes to look to see how
many competitors there are on Angie's
List and thumbtack and then these are
the cells that I have yet to fill in
that we're going to fill in together so
I'm going to go to outs scraper and I'm
going to start fresh here so let me
close these extra
windows and so I've been doing other
scraping today for stuff outside of this
but if you look at these scrapes that
say dumpster rental service specifically
from this morning these are all the
different cities and so I'm going to do
something that's a little tedious and
it's going to make you square them a bit
and I will share this Google sheet with
everyone I'll put it in like the comment
or in the uh description on YouTube this
is going to be a little tedious but bear
with me this is a live stream right tune
me out I don't care and I'm going to
export
these and I'm going to paste them into

[04:02]
these and I'm going to paste them into
I'm going to consolidate
them so here's the thing I assume you
can still see this I think you can see
my whole screen when you scrape things
from outs scraper the phone number is
the gold this is what we're here for
okay and I like working with stuff in
Google Sheets that's just me I don't
know call me a millennial but when you
paste these phone numbers into Google
Sheets directly it formats them really
weird from Google Sheets so I always
have to remove the plus one in the space
and then the Dash and another thing that
does is it standardizes them just to
make the data cleaner to work with so
I'm going to try this here I'm just
going to paste it see what happens yeah
see the phone number it's dumb so we're
going to go in here and I'm going to do
I'm going to do this all at once
so I exported the bottom
one and now I'm just going to export all
of them boom boom so there should be six
cities here

[05:00]
cities here
six exports for all six
cities so let's go to this top one and
you know what I
am I don't need all this
data I just want ah I might as well get
all of
it so let's do this so
dumb now I could have put all these
cities in
here and scraped them at once but I
wanted you to see like this tedious
process so this is Indiana we haven't
done Indiana yet just making sure this
is
right all right so I've got one market
let's see how many I've done these four
plus the one that I started with so
let's go here that was the first one the
second
one Toledo okay I think this will be all
of them

[06:07]
all right so now I'm going to sort these
by city name just to make sure that I
have everything that I
want okay Cincinnati Cleveland Fort
Wayne Grand Rapids Cincinnati Cleveland
Fort Wayne Grand Rapids Madison
Toledo Cincinnati Cleveland Fort Wayne
Grand renss Madison Toledo all right
we've got all six cities here and then
we have a bunch of scrapes that did not
have a city there was just not enough
data on Google and then we have a bunch
of like outlying uh suburbs that Google
Maps picked up that we can't really
account for okay and so we can get as
granular as you want but I don't want
this to take six hours so I'm going to
keep this simple the populations I
pulled were only from the actual cities
not from the Greater Cincinnati area so

[07:00]
not from the Greater Cincinnati area so
I'm going to keep all the data true and
so I'm going to assume this is an
assumption that there is a similar
percentage of blank entries on all of
these cities I could be wrong right if I
were starting a business I would get
much more granular with this but I'm not
this is for instructional purposes only
and so I'm going to
delete all the ones that don't have a
city and I'm going to delete all of the
ones outside of the ones that I want and
then I'm going to delete delete well I'm
not going to delete the ones with a
phone number and I'll tell you why in a
minute but I am going to remove this
other stuff so I'm doing plus one space
replace all with nothing and then I'm
going to do the dash replace all with
nothing okay so now the phone numbers
are standardized I want to remove
duplicates but I don't want to remove
these so look at all these duplicates
okay but you know what I don't actually
want to remove these for this purpose
because this is a multilocation business

[08:00]
because this is a multilocation business
it seems and we want to account for that
yes so that's a big player in um in
Cincinnati so I want to account for all
of their businesses so a lot of times I
remove duplicates based on what I'm
doing for this I'm not
so we're going to go here and I don't
know what is up with Google Sheets
lately but it's has not been letting me
paste as values only all right so here's
our data directly in Google Sheets okay
so we we can do a pivot table we could
get fancy with this I'm not going to do
that I'm just going to Simply count by
city so Cincinnati has
17 okay and I'm just going to do a quick
like a look over okay like garbage
collection yeah they're going to mix in
some other random ones
but junk removal a lot of garbage
collection services offer dumpster
rentals so I'm not going to delete any
of these I'm just simply going to put
the counts in so Cincinnati we've got 17
Cleveland we've got 11 let's make this

[09:03]
Cleveland we've got 11 let's make this
easy
17 11 Fort Wayne Grand
Rapids Fort
Wayne Seven Grand Rapids
seven
7741 all
right okay so let's go ahead and get a
percentage okay now this isn't the best
percentage but you can clearly
see okay these are the cities that are
mostly saturated so
Cincinnati if you go to Cincinnati it is
controlled and I will tell you I've
never done this before like I've done
this process but I've never done it with
dumpster ryal in Ohio and so I'm to be
learning just like you guys this is

[10:00]
learning just like you guys this is
actually really fascinating what is this
company again rumy so rumy has a pretty
pretty strong foothold on this market so
Cincinnati has the most and it's also
the most saturated Toledo second most
saturated and then Madison Wisconsin
four companies or yeah geez four
dumpster rold companies now keep in mind
these are colder cities you will have to
deal with seasonality to some extent
there obviously aren't going to be as
many people building or needing
dumpsters if it's covered with snow
outside but this is fascinating to me
already right we're only a few minutes
into this but we Madison Wisconsin has a
great economy it's a college town
University of Wisconsin 12% real estate
growth which is the second most of the
six cities 5% economic growth which is
the second most average home value
highest by far crime rate lowest by far
average household income highest home
ownership rate middle of the pack and it

[11:01]
ownership rate middle of the pack and it
only has four so this could be
misleading okay so now we're going to go
we're going to pull up Madison Wisconsin
we could stop this right now and this is
the 8020 we'll call it
6040 let's look at
Madison I'm trying to
see so all of these other five examples
are going to have their own suburbs
there's nothing over 100,000 people here
so immediately what this is telling me
is it's not like a Minneapolis St Paul
situation where you've got two big
cities right next to each other Dallas
Fort Worth Etc in fact the biggest
suburb is only 36,000 which is a tenth
of the population of Madison well an
eighth so this is already really
promising this is looking good for
starting a dumpster rental business in
Madison Wisconsin but we're not done we
got to do more right we could unlock
something here in 20 30 minutes that
makes us want to steer clear so we're
going I'm going to show you Google LSA
so if you're unfamiliar with Google LSA

[12:00]
so if you're unfamiliar with Google LSA
it is their answer to Thumbtack and
Angie's List they want to sell Home
Service leads or any business lead to
business owners and they're doing a good
job of it and the leads are actually
really good we use them for our tree
business so I'm going to do this I'm
going to
go I did a little research this morning
on LSA and dumpster rental is not a
category so I'm going to show you
this you go to Allen Texas Tree Service
show more
and then you go more tree service
providers you got to know where to click
these are LSA listings that's us huh and
then here way down here are organic uh
Tree Service listings and so if I go
look for dumpster ryal it's not there
Roofing is there and so I can't really
do this LSA research in a very clean way
so we're going to find a workaround so
we're going to say Madison Wisconsin

[13:00]
we're going to say Madison Wisconsin
dumpster rental we're going to look at
more businesses now okay this is Google
LSA Google guaranteed but the problem
with this view that you're looking at
right here Google will only show a
maximum of two LSA listings but we are
learning something here because there's
only one company in all of Madison
bidding on LSA because if there were at
least two then it would list right here
this is organic this is paid because
this is Google guaranteed so we're gonna
we're going to go with this okay and
we're going to add this to our data and
we're going to go LSA Madison one okay
now we're going to
say
so now this is sponsored so Google's
confusing because you can do Google ads
you can do Google LSA you can do
performance ads you can do search ads
there's six ways you can promote your

[14:00]
there's six ways you can promote your
home service business on Google so this
is what I'm looking at is most likely
just like a Google ads listing and not
LSA because it doesn't say Google
guaranteed let's try this in a bigger
Market to see how it
looks all right so this is exactly what
I was talking about it will only show
you a Max of two sponsored listings and
so we're going to we're going to go back
here we're still going to use this
and we're just going to call that one
then we're going to go we're going to
call that zero because there's none so
let's go back here it's a little tedious
one and then Cleveland is zero so now we
still got to do Fort Wayne Grand Rapid
in
Cincinnati
zero zero

[15:03]
zero
okay okay so LSA in all of these markets
LSA is not it's just not very strong and
I'm not surprised because LSA is fairly
new they don't have a ton of market
share yet Believe It or Not which means
it's an Arbitrage opportunity for you I
know people that have Home Service
businesses that wholly rely on Google
LSA they'll get a tree bid a tree lead
for $50 they close half of
and their average job is $800 so it's
basically $100 customer acquisition cost
you know 50% margins you're still making
about 300 bucks per job there are people
that just bid up all the areas and only
rely on Google LSA so there is an
opportunity there but it doesn't give us
a lot for these markets and we're
combining LSA and just normal Google
paid ads here so let's go to thumb teac
so I'm going to open Thumbtack and you
want to do this right because we're
doing research but we don't want these

[16:01]
doing research but we don't want these
businesses that we're researching to
have to spend money because of our
research so you have to do this the
right way if I were to type in dumpster
rental Cleveland Ohio and then go
through like the process it would charge
these businesses just for giving me a
quote a a good amount of money too
depends on if it's Roofing could be
hundreds if it's a locksmith could be 20
bucks but I have no intent of actually
buying from these people so I don't want
I don't want them to have to pay money
and so we've got to do this a very
specific way we're going to say let me
do this go back to Thumbtack so this is
basically thumb tac's landing page for
their
services where is dumpster
rynal okay this is what I was going to
do okay let's go let's just do all this
alphabetically so let's go to Cincinnati
I'm going to get their zip
code uh
and so no one's been charged yet
I haven't requested a quote and I'm only

[17:01]
I haven't requested a quote and I'm only
seeing one result so that's Cleveland
let's do it
here
two oh no one in that zip code let's
just I'm going to take a look at the ZIP
code make sure it is populated yeah okay
but so a lot of this depends on if these
guys are bidding in that exact they
could be in the neighboring zip code but
I would think if this is downtown Fort
Wayne then people would be bidding on it
but they're not so we're going to put a
zero here Grand renss Madison and
Toledo
two
zero 2011 okay

[18:02]
all right now we're going to go to
Angie's List and we're going to copy
that zip code again I'm going to close
thumb Tech and okay here's what we want
to okay we got to do Angie list
differently so we're already on
Cleveland's page I pulled this up and we
want to see how many are on Angie's List
now Angie's List I'm pretty sure they
scrape data from Manta Google Maps Etc
so they will list everyone and if and
they'll the people that pay Angie's List
for lead they will put them at the top
but people that they just scrape they
will put them in the back that way if
someone for some reason goes to the
second or third page clicks on someone
then Angie's List will reach out to that
person and say hey we've got a job for
you it incentivizes them to sign up for
Angie's List so we're just going to do
this we're going to go to the bottom of
this we want to go to the landing page
for dumpster rental in Cleveland and you
can Google it to get here and we just
want to know how many
65 and I I went to the last page and
looked and like they do a lot of
reaching right like on the last page

[19:01]
reaching right like on the last page
there's they're pretty far out like
somewhere an hour away but we're just
going to keep everything constant
so let's go back here so let's do
this Cincinnati Fort
wi pull that
up so we're just looking at the city
landing page for Angie's
List Grand rap
Grand Rapids Madison
Toledo all right so we've got all of
them pulled up Cincinnati now we got to
scroll down here and we got to find
dumster
Reynold
52 and we're done with that Fort
Wayne 13 man Fort Wayne like I've never
I'm not going to lie I've never looked

[20:00]
I'm not going to lie I've never looked
at Fort Wayne very
favorably but whatever here we are no
offense to anyone in Fort Wayne it's not
Gary 28 in Grand
Rapids wouldn't it be hilarious if there
were like 87 dumpster rental companies
in Madison Wisconsin by the end of this
month I would love that so
much all right internet's a little slow
today let's see
17 in
Toledo 17 in Toledo and 14 in
[Music]
Madison okay there's our anges list data
and let's go ahead
and clean this up and you know what I'm
just going to delete the LSA column
because to me there's not enough data
there to really draw a conclusion on it
so it just looks messy right now and
honestly Thumbtack I don't know I just
wanted delete thumb Tech too but I'll

[21:00]
wanted delete thumb Tech too but I'll
leave it I'll leave it
so let's do
this let's do this we're going to make
we're going to divide this by the number
of businesses in the area because that's
going to be a cleaner
percentage we're going to do the same
here
so well yeah man that's yeah it's going
to be a a a triple digit percentage
because there's more on Cincinnati
Angie's List than there is on Google
Maps which is because they're pulling
from a wide area but whatever we'll keep
it the same
so we could also do the reverse what
percentage of um anges list businesses
are on Google Maps but
whatever
okay I'm just going to start observing
this in real time so let's look at this
so
Cleveland in this sense the higher
percentage I guess it doesn't really
make a difference

[22:03]
okay
so if we look at this percentage which
is basically the saturation po per City
Madison I guess I should have reversed
this right CU we want green to be
good Madison and Fort Wayne are
attractive but honestly Fort Wayne is
not as attractive because if you look at
the not bad at crime rate if you look at
the real estate growth growth economic
growth well you know what I take a back
Fort Wayne is not is not that bad I've
been hating on Fort Wayne I don't like
the average home value of Cleveland I
really like to see that higher
but let's do this this is what we want
to do we want to call this the Google
percentage and the Angie percentage

[23:09]
so if you look at the Angie
percentage Fort Wayne is at the top
again Toledo and Madison top
three Toledo is at the bottom as far as
Google is concerned okay so Thumbtack is
there we're not going to do that math
I'm just going to delete that people
aren't using Thumbtack which you can
see okay so so far we're seeing that
Madison and Fort Wayne look pretty dang
good now let's say I'm in Ohio and for
whatever sick reason I want to open a
business in Ohio I'm gonna look at these
top three really bad household income
but hey there are there is a need for
dumpster rentals there home ownership
rate all in the 40s crime rate all
High real estate growth okay so Toledo
is the highest household income second

[24:00]
is the highest household income second
lowest home value middle of the pack
that best real estate
growth not that much on Angie's
List you know what I want to do this I
don't like this I want to do this as a
percentage of
population so once again Fort Wayne
Toledo Madison are they're the least
saturated all green
there Toledo's a little more
saturated should we give these guys a
call okay Garrett asked is the real
estate growth economic growth crime Etc
all scrape from out scraper no actually
I asked you GPT all of these and then I
kind of cherry-picked a couple to to
confirm and it was accurate because
sometimes it's not so let's give these
guys a because I want to know are these

[25:00]
guys a because I want to know are these
guys swamped with business are they not
I want to know what my competitors look
like am I going to voicemail or an
answering service let's do this so I'm
going to get my actual phone and I'm
gonna call them and I guess it's a good
thing I'm not using my phone as a camera
because I need to use it here
so I'm going to stop sharing my
screen I'm going to start calling some
people and you can hate this all you
want but I'm not going to talk to them
okay so yeah I'm going to waste their
time today for about three seconds I
want to know if they answer because that
is the litmus test that I'm performing
right now do they answer their phone and
I'm going to keep the variables constant
because I'm calling them all at the same
time but we're not accounting for maybe
he's on the phone right then maybe some
oneoff variables are happening so you
can get a lot more granular with this
you could call them you could call
everyone once in the morning afternoon

[26:00]
everyone once in the morning afternoon
and evening on Monday Wednesday Friday
you could get as granular as you want
but uh I just want to see right off the
bat how many people are picking up so
we're only going to look at these ones
we're not going to look at the ones in
the outlying
areas so I'm going
to let's see I'm just going to go down
the
line okay so if you see my
phone I just pasted it from my MacBook
to my phone and I'm going to call him on
speaker and see if he
answers this reminds me of a scene in
the office I can't remember which one
hello and thank you for calling for a
dumpster port or rental if you're a
homeowner press one if you're a business
or contractor press two all right so
that's an answering service so I'm going
to mark that as answering service that
was fast enough we'll go to the next
one call ended 419

[27:04]
one call ended 419
451 yeah it's right
there it's not going
through well it's a good sign so
far let's go to the next
one it's Larry all right Larry answered
sorry
Larry I'm going to get so many people
calling me
back can I you okay another answer on
the first ring both of
them so I'm going let me count how many
of these there are so we've got 57 I
could probably call all
these hey this is with Cincinnati ders

[28:00]
these hey this is with Cincinnati ders
sorry
[Music]
this got to be the least exciting thing
you watch
today your call has been forwarded to
voicemail that's a
no I don't know if I'm going to call all
these so let me call more I want to get
a good like a Baseline and then I want
to go straight to Madison I want to see
how companies are fairing in Madison
Wisconsin stop ringing
I'm G to call that a

[29:10]
no oh I'm going to show you something
here in a minute you're going to like
all right stick with me here it's gonna
get a lot better Queen City dumpster all
right he
answered I'm going to finish
Cincinnati and then I'm going to text
some of these guys thank you for calling
dumpster rental Solutions the number one
dumpster rental provider in the
Cincinnati
[Music]
area I hope someone out there is already
doing this research in their own area
because you're that excited that's what
I'd be doing hello and thank you for
calling
for now okay in answering service that's
not doesn't mean they suck but it's not
as good as answering right away

[30:06]
thank you
for that's a
yes all right now all of these are the
same company so let's see what they do
it's got to be an answering service
right if it was my company and I had all
those locations I would not have an
answering service
there are ways to get it's an 800 number
yeah it's not even ringing so that's not
a good sign all right now this last one
does not have a phone number at all
dumpster tub let's I just want to do a
little
research they've got products like they
went through the effort of putting this
here but they don't have their freaking
phone number what are you guys
doing
huh so we're going to call that a no
we're going to count any that don't have
a phone number is a no then let's call

[31:00]
a phone number is a no then let's call
all of them in Madison I'm actually
going to talk to these
ones oh this is a recycling
[Music]
center I just realized you can't see my
screen okay so that is recycling center
I'm going to share my screen again so
you can see that so this is actually
very interesting because if we do get
more granular then we learned that one
of the four dumpster rental companies in
Madison is not a dumpster rental company
at all not a garbage service that also
rent dumpsters it's just a recycling
center so we're going to go back to the
research we're going to go here to
Madison we're going to change that to
three and look at those numbers pop and
so
literally Cincinnati
Ohio is five times more saturated
exactly than Madison Wisconsin so it's I

[32:00]
exactly than Madison Wisconsin so it's I
guess it's good that I called all of the
ones in Cincinnati because we're on both
ends of the spectrum here so we only
have three in Cincinnati let's give them
a call Kars dumpsters so since there's
only three let's do a little more
research yep I don't even need a click
that's dumpster
Ral tread lightly
dumpsters
Countrywide dumpster
rental this looks like it could be a
lead generation
site um they just had a Madison Google
page I mean look at this Lakeland
Florida San
Bernardino contact
us okay this gets very interesting I bet
you anything this is just a lead
generation company that's grown using
programmatic SEO which is here's a
secret this is what we do as well we use
programmatic SEO for the same type of
stuff if you ever want to do
programmatic SEO email me by the way
Chris co-founder .c I can help you out
with that this is very interesting these

[33:01]
with that this is very interesting these
guys are just selling leads junk
removal and dumpster rental very
smart yep completely different landing
page geez Louise okay so Madison like
the more research we do the better it
gets now of course we could go to the
other cities and do more research and
we're going to find similar things that
would bring the numbers down but now
we've got two
so we've got Kars tread lightly that's
it um let's look at Kars and then let's
look at tread
lightly all right I want to see how many
locations these guys have they service
the whole County it is a local business
like this website it's ugly but it's
clean it's clear look at that picture
man that picture is like a Boomer's
dream okay so these guys look like
they're using like a template I've seen
this template before so they're probably

[34:01]
this template before so they're probably
a little more sophisticated they're not
even like in medicine let's see if we
can do
this we're going to try to book I wonder
if this is
like actually tied to their
inventory you know what we're just going
to call these two I don't think this is
going to be tied to their inventory all
right I'm going to YouTube real quick
I'm going to take a breather what am I
learning from the company calls
validating if the business is real great
question I want to know how good they
are at customer service we like we have
a small business our tree tring business
is a small business and James my
operating partner he always answers the
phone he just answers it if he's talking
to a customer quoting a job can you just
give me a second he just answers his
phone because the chance of getting a
job like he knows just just from a call
that comes in cold is call it 30% and if
he gets there in person to quote it face
to face it's 70% right and so let's say
the average job is $1,000 we have a 30%

[35:02]
the average job is $1,000 we have a 30%
chance of closing it that means that if
he misses that call he loses $300 right
and if our margins are 50% he loses $150
we lose $150 in net profit and so
answering the phone is the most simple
yet most important thing you can do so
that's what I want to know an answering
service that's friction that's oh it's a
big company oh they don't care about me
uh they're probably busy friction um and
then surprisingly quite a few of those
just were bad numbers altogether using
this example curious if you recommend
trying to buy an existing business
instead of starting one based on
everything I'm
learning I would not I would start a
business in Madison uh Wisconsin so all
right I want to call these two
businesses because we're down to two now
and I want to ask them if they have
availability to rent three dumpsters
this weekend okay why three because that
will give me a better idea of how busy
they are if yes and it's okay this is
like Prime construction season in
Madison Wisconsin I'm sure three

[36:01]
Madison Wisconsin I'm sure three
dumpsters is quite a bit this weekend is
4 days away so if they say no then it's
that tells me that they're somewhat busy
and they'll also probably tell me I can
rent one not two so that gives me an
idea of exactly how busy they
are like I'm expecting them to say no
because it's short notice so that
doesn't tell me a lot I would prefer if
they say yes they do have availability
to rent three dumpsters this weekend
because that's going to tell me that
they're not very busy and that's going
to be a red flag that that conflicts
with almost everything I'm learning
about the dumpster rental business in
Madison Wisconsin so I'm going to call
both of them
and I'm gonna keep sharing my
screen and I will put the audio up to
the mic

[37:18]
thank you for calling tread Services
anyone surprised is anyone surprised it
went to voicemail guy's busy that's my
assumption let's call call the next one
and then I'm going to do a little more
research before we text any of these
guys so that was tread lightly now we're
going to go to kar's this is so exciting
I'm like a kid in a candy store right
now all right I'm calling Kars and I
like pulling up their website as I talk
to them just so I sound like less of an
idiot hello this is K dumpsters how may
I help you hey I was wondering if you
have availability for three 15 yard
rentals this weekend um when were you
thinking of getting those dropped off
it's flexible maybe Saturday morning or
or Friday
afternoon we yeah Friday we could do

[38:01]
afternoon we yeah Friday we could do
Friday we could drop them off Friday um
we have 12 yards 20 yards and 30 yards
um I don't I don't see it being a
problem on Friday is that okay uh that
might be okay I'm just doing research
right now are you pretty busy this
weekend we don't deliver on weekends oh
okay are you pretty busy this week no
Friday's open that's Friday Thursday and
tomorrow sort of okay okay well I'm just
trying to call around right now but I
will give you a call back if I decide to
go that
direction all right have a great day sir
thank you all right so that was
interesting not as busy as I would have
thought now look at their website
compared to try lightly you can book
online that's like the obvious you don't
have to build out a custom website
there's probably a theme or a package
you could buy for a couple hundred bucks
here
you you can't you got to call them it's
friction now we're going to okay we're
going to do a little we're going to do a
little research here so we're going to

[39:00]
little research here so we're going to
go we're going to look them up on Google
Earth all right
okay
o so it looks like it I wonder if this
terara engineering business is owned by
the same
person a lot of times these dumpster run
companies start out as construction
businesses and then they buy some
dumpsters and then they start loaning
them out to other people in the industry
and next thing they know they're in
business so I'm not learning a lot here
other
than it looks like he might just be
piggybacking on another
business yeah I would love to see a
bunch of dumpsters lined up but that's
just like a trash pile and then look at
Countrywide this Leen Factory we could
learn something from these guys I bet
you
anything okay what is this

[40:01]
anything okay what is this
address they're not fitting many
dumpsters in there I wonder how they got
the hookup to validate their address on
Google
Maps there's all kind of tricks of the
trade so that's interesting 32
reviews just reading these reviews here
do you see any typos do you see any look
at these
names Michaela win Hershey
abon Ashley
Williams I accessed the website this is
all AI written literally not any human
on this planet has ever said I went and
accessed your
website I bet you anything they have a
standard review and then they tell Chad
gbt write this 15 different ways and
they just swap out synonyms it ends up
making no sense so these are all fake
reviews and the automation automatically
responds to them with AI very
interesting very we're doing
I I will admit we're doing something
similar not with dumpster not anything

[41:01]
similar not with dumpster not anything
near dumpster Reynold but a Le gen
service with programmatic SEO and we're
seeing some really good results from it
so no shade but it's just interesting
seeing this for what it is okay
so we've learned a lot especially about
Madison Wisconsin but now I want to text
all these guys and so I'm going to take
all these phone numbers and I am going
to remove the ones with blank phone
numbers I'm going to take
this and let's close
that and I'm going to open a new
sheet and I'm going to remove
duplicates okay
so I just want their cell their phone
numbers here and I'm going to scrub
these if they're cell or
landline so I'm going to save this as a
CSV doesn't matter what I save it as and
then I'm going to go to this website
over here Sly broadcast and they are

[42:03]
over here Sly broadcast and they are
happy to
validate these lists and tell me if it
is a what's it
called if they're sell or
landline so I'm going to upload this
list all I have in it are the phone
numbers save spits it out 82 contacts
I'm going to download it
open
it
okay
let's go ahead and add a
header I don't care about the land lines
right
now I don't care about the unknown
I only want the cell phone

[43:02]
numbers so I do want to remove the one I
just talked to because I just talked to
him and I know what's going on there
[Music]
so that was Kars I believe
right
2565 yes all right so I'm going to
remove that
well I guess he wasn't in there because
that wasn't a cell phone so save that
list now I'm going to go to message
media and I use quite a few different
texting platforms but this is the one
that I like for this type of of outbound
texting the most so this is our
co-founders account and we have a few
different phone numbers and I'm going to
go to contexts
list and create a list

[44:01]
and then I'm going to
upload that list into that specific
list I only need their phone
numbers so once again this doesn't give
us data from people that are using
what's it called Lan lines or unknown
phone numbers it just gives us data from
people that have cell phone numbers but
it's really quick and
easy so I'm going to use this list only
27 numbers and I'm going to
[Music]
say that's it that's all I'm going to
say I don't need a personalization in
here it's a very binary
question I'll do

[45:00]
this and I'm going to click Send and
it's not a big sample size but it's
something and now we
wait and let's see if we have any
responses we got
one I wish we had because we would get
like a 10 to 30% response rate right
away
okay all right well that's
something how would you go to market if
you decide to launch a dumpster ryal
well that is uh that's a whole other
live stream in and of itself we're not
getting more responses I'm surprised I
want to text
more let's see what could I do to text
more okay all right call me I don't like
that if I'm texting you I want you to
respond via text what material

[46:02]
fully booked okay that's something 8826
I want to see where he's at Grand
Rapids
okay okay these guys are pretty busy
8091 Fort Wayne yeah Fort Wayne is a
good Market we're not surprised that
they're busy we already knew that
can you book
online book online imagine
that all right all right going back to
the
questions I went with these Lewis
because I've just I've been doing this
for 15 years and trial and error these
are just what I've settled with they
work well they might not look pretty but
they're better than the other
options um okay my ADD is in full force
right now where was I all right there we
are let's see how many responses we got

[47:01]
are let's see how many responses we got
27 texts and we got one two three four
five six
7 okay um so 20 something percent
response rate right off the bat not bad
it's too bad we didn't text more people
let's I want to look more into this guy
8091 okay look at now this is legit Blue
Line bins all five star reviews
82 we got a big parking lot I assume
that most of these spots normally have
dumpsters but it's mostly empty now
here's a little life hack the obviously
the the Google Street View that you see
will be different than the Google Earth
view that you see
so you can get two different points in
time and then if you really want to get
granula with it oh this is
good okay so it looks like they just do
all kinds of stuff

[48:00]
[Music]
you're going to like this what I'm about
to show you this should be good so it
looks like it hasn't even been there for
that long this is May 2023 that was an
autocredit Place here's what we're going
to
do we're going
to take that address
we're not going to learn a lot from this
because it hasn't been in business for
that long but you get the
idea so I need to be able to zoom in
more that's a bummer I can't zoom in any
more than that so forget I said anything
that doesn't work but I had the right
idea let's go back to
this we don't have 20 yards and our 11
yards are currently being
used okay so I don't like this guy dude
come on imagine how much you can learn
just from this just seeing how busy
everyone is demolition contractor just

[49:00]
everyone is demolition contractor just
take it llc.net
oh saying the phrase llc.net gives me an
aneurism that is
painful so I don't think you can book
online but yeah whatever it's a website
okay so what have we learned let's go
back to the research tab it looks like
there needs to be this business in
Madison and or Toledo and or Fort Wayne
we could do a lot more research in these
cities because for all we know Grant
Grand Rapid is a great place to open
because maybe it looks saturated on the
surface but if you call everyone and
really dig in and do your research and
you find out that they're all busy and
there's room for more or if you find out
in the northeast corner of the of the
city there's no one right but be careful
with research because let's say you live
in Grand Rapids it's a great place and
you don't want to move and you really
want to start a a dumpster business then
you're going to have confirmation bias
everywhere you look you're like well
they're not too busy but there's no one
around the corner well don't try to Lo
yourself into doing this follow the data
right be unbiased follow the data or

[50:01]
right be unbiased follow the data or
else you'll get yourself in trouble so
what I like to do when doing this
research let's say you're not location
agnostic and you want to go to a
specific area be willing to do five
different businesses and do all this
research so we've only it's only taken
an hour to do this do all this research
for all five businesses and it will
scale right it won't take five hours to
do it it'll take two and a half hours
because you're studying the same cities
you're just swapping out the the Home
Service businesses so don't get too
attached to an industry or a city be
flexible on both but this is the 8020 or
9010 of finding out if specifically a
home service business could be VI viable
in any given area you can get a lot more
granular with it you could text a lot
more people you could you can make pivot
tables you can make charts and graphs
and Yad yada y but you're not going to
learn anything new than what we've
already learned right here so I will
link to all this stuff in the YouTube
video I hope you enjoyed something hope
you learned something yeah
let me see if there are any questions
before we end this what question would

[51:01]
before we end this what question would
you ask to gauge demand if this was
researching Roofing instead of
dumpsters that's a good question Roofing
in my opinion is just like a home
service business in and of itself
because it is you know instead of being
a $200 pressure washing job or a $2,000
tree job it's a $20,000 job which puts
it in a whole other category and that
also means that you know Roofing has
attracted a lot of sophisticated
operators because they feel rightly so
to a degree that they could do the same
amount of work to get a $220,000 job as
they could get it to get a $2,000 job
and because the margins are also good in
Roofing you have a lot of people
spending a lot of money in marketing you
have a lot of agencies built up around
Roofing to compete there and so it is
hard to keep compete in Roofing because
there's a lot of people there for all of
those reasons if you haven't already I
would love for you to subscribe my
newsletter I talk about this stuff
there's no ads in the newsletter there's
no cost I do it once a week Chris
jer.com KO R NE R thank you Terrell

[52:01]
jer.com KO R NE R thank you Terrell
appreciate that I honestly just want
people to quit their job if you love
your job then you're not watching this
so if you love your job then don't quit
your job jobs are great but if you're
watching this you probably want to quit
your job or you probably already have a
business and I want you to grow your
business or quit your job that's my goal
would love to see a sort of inverted
version of
this what do you mean by that
Louis where you have an air area you
want to be in and want to identify
service businesses that's a great idea I
love it I love it I'm back to the
texting right now I know I'm not sharing
my screen but one person said may I ask
who this is the other person said yes so
that's 1 two 3 four five six 7 8 n 10 10
responses from 27 sheesh all right
that's like almost 40% response rate not
bad at all okay well I think I'm going
to wrap it up thank you guys for joining
and I hope you learn something and if
you ever have any questions just email

[53:00]
you ever have any questions just email
me Chrisco founders.com and I'll do my
best to help you with the time that I
