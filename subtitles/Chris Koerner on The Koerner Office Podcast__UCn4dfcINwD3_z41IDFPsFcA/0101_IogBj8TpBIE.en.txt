okay so this is my favorite inventor
that I promise you've never heard of he
created A1 billion doll product that you
have used so this guy Roger Wittenberg
in the 70s was an organic chemist who
started selling old bags of Bakery bread
to Pork Farms as a side Hustle but then
he started throwing away all these
plastic bags and thought this can't be
good for the environment what should I
do with them so he would take the stale
bread and the plastic bags shred them
together melt it together and he would
make 2x6 boards that is now known as
trxx an artificial decking company worth
$1 billion doll with a bee some cool
facts about this business they buy all
of the recyclable plastic bags from
Target and Walmart and put those into
decks it takes
2,250 bags to make one 2x6 and they used
to have to make the 2 by sixes out of
the color of the bags that they use
