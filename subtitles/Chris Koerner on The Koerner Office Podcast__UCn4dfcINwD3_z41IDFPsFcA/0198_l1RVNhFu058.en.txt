three and a half years ago I walked into
a gas station called bies these guys
have over 120 gas pumps they're all over
Texas and they are a cult phenomenon I
walked out $3,000 worth of snacks in an
unofficial partnership to sell all of
their products online I want to tell you
the full story with all the details the
margins the partnership how it works how
it worked how it looks today and then at
the end I'm going to tell you how you
can create opportunities like these for
yourself
[Music]
first of all three and a half years ago
I was running a company called send eats
with my cousin Kirk send eats was an
e-commerce fulfillment brand where
e-commerce companies that shipped food
products would send all their stuff to
us and we would manage all of the the
logistics but it was tough it was a
tough business it was low margin at the
same time I took my cousin Kirk to bues
for the first time and he was in awe

[01:00]
for the first time and he was in awe
there's nothing like bies all right once
you've been you're a changed person
forever and on the way home we were
talking about man how much must these
guys do online these guys must do
hundreds of millions a year online we
pulled up their website and there was no
shop button we couldn't believe it there
was no way to buy their products online
now keep in mind bies is a brand like
Disney their Beaver mascot is Iconic you
see it all over the world okay and to
think that they didn't sell their stuff
online just boggled my mind and I wanted
to fix that right I saw dollars being
burned in front of me and I wanted to
fix that so I started cold emailing the
founders the two Founders over and over
and over no response nothing and I'm
good at Cold emailing nothing so I I
thought Kirk what if we did this
ourselves what if we launched a viral
publicity stunt and launched their store
for them and he's like well what if we
get sued it's like well let's look into
that so we start googling around and we
we learn about what's called the first
sale Doctrine first sale Doctrine means

[02:02]
sale Doctrine first sale Doctrine means
that anyone can resell whatever they
want if you have a used iPhone you can
sell it as an iPhone you just can't
pretend to be apple and so we knew that
we would be protected under first sale
Doctrine as long as we didn't cause
confusion with the customer about us
being bies or not and so we threw up a
website it was called Beaver snacks with
an
x.com because the bues mascot is a
beaver and it was an ugly website and
you can probably look at some pictures
here or the web Archive of what it
looked like it was like a pale yellow
really really bad I hired a professional
photographer from Thumbtack she charged
3 or 400 bucks we had2 or $3,000 worth
of snacks I've got some pictures here
for you to see uh long receipts and I
thought okay worst case scenario they
try to sue us uh or it just never takes
off no one cares it doesn't generate any
attention and I have a panry full of
snacks I don't know what to do with okay
and it but it's a good story at least I
have a good story best case scenario it

[03:00]
have a good story best case scenario it
goes viral and it influences bies to
partner with us we wanted to be their
full e-commerce provider we wanted to
basically do everything for them head to
tail manage all all their Logistics set
up the website everything which was
abnormal that's not what we did for
other customers our other customers
already had a website they already had a
business and a brand we wanted to bring
them online so best case scenario we
could bring them online and be there
their official partner and then anywhere
in between would be cool too anyway so
we buy beaver next.com we put up a
website we take pictures of everything
and we launch quote launch and his
crickets because no one knew we were
there I posted it Reddit it and uh we we
sold like a jar of quail eggs pickled
Quil eggs and I was like yes we got a
customer and people on Reddit loved the
story it didn't go viral or anything but
it had thousands of views and a couple
dozen comments and I think it's still
around somewhere and then I started cold
emailing some reporters this was
November 2020 so coming up on four years
now early November 2020 and I basically

[04:01]
now early November 2020 and I basically
said this is who I am this is what we're
doing we want to get Bucky's attention
do you want to write about this and they
loved it a reporter from Texas monthly
reached out to me and he asked me all
these questions and he was excited and I
was excited and then he called me back
we were speaking throughout the day and
a few hours later he called me back and
he said hey uh good news the Buy's
lawyer wants to talk to you I'm like how
does the Buy's lawyer know that I exist
he's like oh I reached out for
comment in my head I'm like why did you
do that I don't want them to know about
this yet like I'm going to be shut down
before I'm I'm even launched and so I
called up the lawyer and he was actually
really nice he was a nice guy and he
said I need you to make three changes
for me but I'm I'm not mad I we don't
mind that you do this uh we tried
e-commerce we thought about it but it's
just not something we want to do they
don't they feel like they need to charge
their customers more online than what
they charge in store in order to make
the numbers work and frankly I think
they're right they do need to and they
don't want to that's the whole thing
they really value their customers they

[05:02]
they really value their customers they
want to keep that inore experience
sacred and so they don't want to have to
sell the same products for more online
because I think it would upset their
customers and they want they want their
customers to continue to have a reason
to come into the story anyway and so it
just fit for someone else to do this for
them and so we spoke and he said make
three changes change the name I don't
want the word beaver in the name because
beaver's our mask gu it's kind of
confusing and I said no problem we
haven't even really launched yet other
than this Reddit post number two we want
disclaimer in the logo and we want the
logo to be on every page of the website
and I was like oh that's kind of ugly
right like have you ever seen a logo in
your life with a disclaimer in it
probably not until you go to texas.com
now you have and so we said okay not
ideal but we'll do it he said number
three I want that disclaimer in every
product description on your website all
right that one's easy so we did we made
all the changes the Articles went live
and we went viral now when I say viral I
mean like Texas viral okay dozens of

[06:00]
mean like Texas viral okay dozens of
Articles written eer Texas
monthly Texas monthly is the biggest
news publication in the state of Texas a
few others and we did almost
$200,000 in those first 30 or 45 days
now it really helped that we were right
up against Christmas and Thanksgiving
timing was perfect and it was a mad
house now we already had a warehouse we
already were shipping food and other
e-commerce things for other brands this
wasn't way out of the norm but they have
thousands of SKS SKU stock keeping unit
things to sell and it's hard managing
and then then they had hundreds of
different expiration dates and you don't
want to ship something that's been
expired or you could get sued or bues
could sue us or it's just it could get
ugly and so we had to work through all
these on the Fly and you know I've once
heard that entrepreneurship is like um
building an airplane while you're trying
to fly and that's exactly what this felt
like we were doing all these sales but
we weren't taking very good care of
these orders it was taking a long time
to get them out the door and we had stay
CES and it was just hairy but we figured

[07:01]
CES and it was just hairy but we figured
it out because at the same time we're
still having to ship orders for all of
our other customers as well and it was
just it was hairy but we figured out and
so we got into 2021 um and things were
getting a lot better and we just kept
growing every month we grew a little
more and then for the first couple years
in business we were growing but like we
weren't really putting enough attention
into it because we had all these other
customers for our e-commerce brand and
some of these were paying some of these
customers were paying us two $300,000
per month to ship their products whereas
with bies if we were late on an order
then Karen in Omaha Nebraska got a
little upset about her $60 order and so
we kind of had Texas snacks on the back
burner until we realized that all these
big fancy customers paying us hundreds
of thousands per month weren't really
all that profitable we looked at the
numbers we thought okay Texas snacks is
profitable these guys are profitable
what are we doing so we ended up making
a really hard decision and firing all of
our EC commer fulfillment customers we

[08:00]
our EC commer fulfillment customers we
just we shut down that whole business
and we had to let some employees go cuz
it wasn't very profitable especially for
the headache we had to cut our lease
early we got in a fight with our
landlord moved to a smaller warehouse
and we went all in on Texas snacks and
it was the best decision we ever could
have made our sales doubled every time
they opened a store we kept growing and
we've been Off to the Races ever sense
so our net profit margins are somewhere
between 10 and 20% depends on their
discounts if if we're doing paid ads at
the time or not but it's somewhere
around 15% give or take um and we're
doing millions of dollars a year I don't
want to tell you exactly how much but
we're growing 30 to 70% every year and
it's it's healthy and it's a good
business and it has good margins and
we're actually really really good at
shipping our stuff really fast now uh
which took us years to learn and so
we've got great reviews anyway what I
care about is you taking something away
from this that you can apply so I gave a
keynote beach in Utah earlier this year

[09:01]
keynote beach in Utah earlier this year
called how to find your white whale and
you could see it right there uh if you
want to check that out and bues was my
white whale right it was my fat pitch
Warren Buffett says that he only makes
one or two Investments per year he says
no to hundreds of things you waits for
that fat pitch to come along and when it
does he swings hard there are fat
pitches like this everywhere white
whales fat pitch call it whatever you
want but it's also an asymmetric BET
right you lose $3,000 in snacks and you
you create potentially a multi-million
dollar company and jobs and profits and
freedom from working for the man right
it's an asymmetric bet and so I
challenge you to look for those white
whales in your life where you can risk a
little bit to gain a potential huge
reward there's another story that I told
here on YouTube right here where I
showed up at John mca's House of mcab
security and I knocked on his door and I
asked him to partner with me on a
project back in 2018 and he said yes
that was another white whale I love
chasing white whales so if you want to

[10:02]
chasing white whales so if you want to
learn stuff like this then please hit
subscribe follow me and I have a lot of
stories like this like this is one of a
couple dozen stories like this I promise
you and I'm going to tell more of them
I'm not here to sell you a bunch of
courses and all that I just want to get
people to quit their jobs if they hate
their jobs and to try entrepreneurship
and if they learn they don't like it
great at least they tried it that's why
I'm here making content for you thanks
for watching and we'll see you next time
