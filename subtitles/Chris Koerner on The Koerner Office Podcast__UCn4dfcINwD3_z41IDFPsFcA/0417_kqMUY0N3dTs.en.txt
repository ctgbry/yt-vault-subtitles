look at this freaking thing right here
would you believe the owners of this
machine make over $6,000 per month per
machine in some random shopping mall in
Australia it's a brilliant business and
they charge $7 for a small cup of
freshly squeezed orange juice they have
six machines and they've sold 32,000 L
worth of juice in their first 18 months
across one to six machines you do the
math on that every cup of juice takes
about six oranges and the Valencia
oranges that they use are much cheaper
than you'd think we're about to see
these vending machines everywhere across
the world because who doesn't love fresh
squeezed orange juice full details right
