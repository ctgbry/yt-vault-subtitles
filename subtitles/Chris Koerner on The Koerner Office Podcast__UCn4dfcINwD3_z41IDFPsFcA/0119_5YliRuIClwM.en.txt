[00:00]
we'll go here this is a four-lane
Highway uh Highway
One and the main office is right here on
the West side of the highway and it's
very because if
you I didn't see the sign when I first
pulled in and that that kind of gave me
dollar signs because every time I see a
park on a busy road without a sign it's
like what are you thinking why are you
even on this busy road if no one knows
you're here then when I left the park I
looked closer and I could see that there
actually was a sign um right up
there so the owner's name is Danny
Lawler and he has this really big
auction business and he has this
business on his property so he'll be
moving his car impounded police vehicles
we get to keep the buildings of course
but he's moving his auction business off
the property um and his signage really

[01:00]
the property um and his signage really
that you you can't even really see these
really it's just God's country I don't
know what gav fall Falls is I don't know
if that's a competitor or what um but
that's his tiny little sign and so one
of the first items of business is going
to be to change that to make a very big
billboard here um the this this kind of
goes hand inand but the the park is like
it has a shareport address but it's not
in the city limits of shareport it's in
the city limits of Blanchard which is
which is a really uh small town so when
I visited the park the mayor of
Blanchard was there and he was basically
selling us on annexing into Blanchard
because he would like our tax revenue
and he said in exchange we will give you
full zoning you know do whatever you
want with regards to zoning we'll speed
up the approval process yada yada yada
and so we'll be able to put a really big
billboard um on our property that
advertises this beautiful property so if
I go out of street view um you'll see
you pull in here and there's a a gate
with a keypad this guy has security

[02:00]
with a keypad this guy has security
locked down uh so gate with a keypad and
then you've got some it's all cement U
pad sites which is pretty hard to find
even at our Parks there's a lot of
gravel you pull in here through the back
this is a mobile home right here that he
rents for like $2,300 a month um so we
will own that I don't know how he he
fetches that much but this is um this is
where you go to check in this is like an
overhead awning where you can park uh
get out of the sun um and there's like a
a fishing store in here kind of like a
general store and then you pull in even
more and then this is a big game room
with like 12 pool tables and arcades uh
no kids allowed and a lot of times we
see these and it's like all right does
anyone actually use this and he said yes
it stays very busy um and then these are
the like the police impound vehicles
from his auction business the he'll be
moving so you keep pulling back

[03:00]
moving so you keep pulling back
and you've got more pad sites I don't
remember what this building is here um
then you have a pool which is really
nice let me see if I
can no I can't pull that down um you got
a nice community pool more pad sites and
I don't know if you saw on Twitter but
he talked about how he has some of these
pad sites are covered and they fetch
$500 more per month um you go back here
and this is a $100,000 kids play area
like it's really really nice and went
ahead and uh put an awning over it cuz
it was it was so hot during the day so
it's really a familyfriendly park which
I like because typically familyfriendly
Parks don't scare away older people it
just it just widens the net of people
that might want to go there um you got a
nice fishing lake here he keeps it
stocked um and then here they call this
the great lodge they rent this out on
vrb only it's not on Airbnb so we'll
change that immediately it has a really
nice pool even nicer than the pool that

[04:00]
nice pool even nicer than the pool that
only residents or only guests of the
great lodge are allowed to stay at and
then I believe this is like an outdoor
kitchen cooking area um on this land he
has his personal property which he is
moving out of we we'll keep the house
but he's he's moving he's building
another house half hour away he got
another big stock Lake here and then he
has a ton of Longhorn cattle out here um
and so this is all part of the property
and then uh the property extends down
this road and then I think it ends right
here so these are just neighbors um and
the house we are going to rent out uh on
vbo and Airbnb as well it's about four
years old marble everything really
Tastefully done it has like a Michael
Phelps swimming pool like not a real
pool but a you know one of those
treadmill pools uh and that it's a 5,000
ft house with a big theater room really
nice so you got a bunch of pads sites
here but one of the first things we're

[05:00]
here but one of the first things we're
going to do is add 37 more pad sites um
right can't remember if it's right here
or right here um and according to Dany
we've seen his waiting list according to
Danny if you were to add these tomorrow
they would fill tomorrow because these
pad s sites in this location especially
the Shaded ones are the most in demand
so we have a lot of experience doing
that um one of our
employees Joe D he has 30 years um
experience in Land
Development it's a great guy and right
there Jody d right there he was uh he
was there last week as well so we go
back here uh all right so that's half
the park um it's 113 Acres or so about
half of the acreage is over here and
then we call this the the west side and
then the east side of the park is right
up the road

[06:02]
you have a
question I heard something uh there it
is all right so you go right up the road
you pull in here and this is the nicer
part of the
park um so you can't tell the topography
or the elevation but this part of the
park sits on one of the highest points
in Northern Louisiana 2777 feet which
does not sound like a lot but for
Louisiana is a lot um you can see on the
website or the video I posted on Twitter
the Drone video it looks gorgeous you
can see out on this this is a Wildlife
Management Area you can see out for
miles and miles um out here really
really a gorgeous view and so there's
another gate with a keypad right here um
I forget what this building is more
cement pad sites you have a supposedly
one of the steepest slides water slides
of this type uh in the state um um and

[07:00]
of this type uh in the state um um and
they only operate it for two hours a day
because it's there's not enough kids to
keep this open all day and they do have
to pay to use it um so he'll put one of
his employees there for a couple hours
in the afternoon and the kids will just
go up and down it all day um and then
this is the old great lodge it's an
older building but it's well-kept and it
has a ton of pitch windows that look out
over that view um and they rent that out
as well on VRBO but not Airbnb for some
reason this is another Lake they keep it
stocked it has a dock going across all
sides of it and they have like those
paddle boats that you can rent and just
kind of uh Tinker around with two
glamping teeps that stay rented pretty
well and then this is called an air
pillow and it's it's massive and it's
just a bunch of air pumped up in the
ground and the kids jump on it and then
they play in the lake and then this is
just a really steep hill and then if you
drive down this road uh We've almost
seen all of it now youve got a few more
cement pad sites and then These are nice

[08:00]
cement pad sites and then These are nice
cabins all of the cabins are Stone on
the outside and then they have um they
all have hot tubs and then here you have
a bath house because you've got
primitive camping here they need
somewhere to go to the bathroom you've
got um covered wagons $48,000 like
lamping covered wagons with AC and
they're actually really nice and popular
got four or five of those um and then
they all use the bath house and the bath
house has these Japanese heated seat
toilets with sensors that automatically
open and these lights turn on when you
approach them so definitely never seen
that in a bath house and then down here
you have parking for the people staying
in these glamping sites and primitive
camping that are like nice elevated pads
um with Stakes like permanent Stakes for
you to hook your tent up to and then
fire pit and more down here and then
this is a very important part of the
property because this is where the um
bik bike park will this is where we'll

[09:01]
bik bike park will this is where we'll
be attached to the bike park um and so
it's a 547 acre Nature Park um it's
called One North they haven't announced
the name yet but two of the
representatives were there with me they
took us all over the property it's going
to have an ampi Amphitheater um it's
going to have a a huge Lake they already
have a lake but they're going to make it
bigger and put a cement path around it
for you know moms to P strollers um and
then the the bike Park is going to have
like this Central Hub where you have
gravel and you have you know black
diamond stuff and more family oriented
stuff and there's even going to be a
pump park where you can go like off
jumps and everything it's going to be
state-of-the-art like I guess there's
one big company in uh like Bentonville
which is world headquarters for mountain
biking and they're known for Designing
and developing the best bike parks and
they hired them to do it um so they're
pulling out all the stops and it's going
to be a a destination and this our Park
will literally be the only um the only

[10:03]
will literally be the only um the only
lodging attached to the bike park so the
entrance of the bike park will
be um I believe it's gonna it's gon to
it's called One North because it's on
Highway one
so yes I
believe Fish Lake I think this is the
lake that they're expanding yeah so the
entrance of the park will be right here
on the highway um and they're going to
expand this Lake make it bigger put the
path around it and then this is a steep
incline they're going to put the
amphitheater for music events right here
um and then there's like there's nothing
around here there's nothing and so when
there's Trail Races or ultramarathons or
bike races or anything um if you don't
have an RV that's fine you can stay in a
cabin you can stay in a glamping TP or a
glamping wagon um this will be the only
place that they could stay that's that
is literally connected to it all so
they're very excited to have us cuz they
think that we will increase the

[11:00]
think that we will increase the
occupancy of their park and vice versa
it will be a free park um funded by the
like the Louisiana Wildlife Commission
and the state and I don't remember what
he said um but we're very very excited
about that because I did not even know
this was going in so it'll be 23 miles
of trails first six miles are going in
this year um but they're rolling it out
in seven phases and it won't be
completely done for 5 years they say so
um if you guys have any questions so far
you can go ahead and leave them in the
comments and I'll get to those uh this
is kind of the first section of the
webinar uh that I wanted to touch on
I'll go ahead while you leave those
comments I'll just kind of zoom out here
um this is shareport you've got about a
quarter million people up here in Texas
Arcana that's 58 minutes away um
streetport it's 19 minutes away uh Long
View and Tyler are you know an hour and
a halfish away and then you've got of
course of course DFW a good three hours

[12:01]
course of course DFW a good three hours
away um so every time we go to Disney or
the beach we always go through shreport
uh so it would make make a lot of sense
for us to stop over and stay there in
our RV
um yeah so let me go got a couple
comments
here okay gravel Falls gavel Falls
Campground just redirects to Gods
country interesting I wonder if that was
an older name uh is the mountain biking
Park a multi-day activity not super
familiar with it it doesn't have to be
but it can be um so there used to be a
bike park in shareport there's just one
and it was really popular uh and it but
it was privately owned and so they ended
up just developing it and putting homes
on it and so there really are no bike
parks in this area and mountain biking
is actually more popular than you think
in this area because Northeast Texas is
pretty hilly there's a lot of pine trees
uh and there's just good topography for
it but there's not a lot of supply so

[13:00]
it but there's not a lot of supply so
you could like you could easily like
Bentonville people go to Bentonville
from all over the world and they'll stay
for a week and they'll just hit all the
trails uh it's it won't I'm not saying
it'll be anything like Bentonville
because in Bentonville there are dozens
if not hundreds of awesome Trails um but
it will justify like 23 miles is quite a
bit of track uh people staying there uh
for multi- days or just going there for
a day for a race or for an
afternoon funding and closing timelines
so the closing day date for the park is
the 15th um we thought we were going to
have to push that but because we didn't
have the appraisal back as of two days
ago but we got the appraisal back this
morning and it was
676 th000 above our purchase price which
was always uh a good nice surprise so
that's just kind of baked in equity for
the GPS and the LPS uh on day one so to
go back to your original question July
15th um is the closing date it might be
pushed a week just because that's how

[14:00]
pushed a week just because that's how
things go a lot um but we like to get
all the funds in with a few days to
spare um just to be safe but it seems
like investors are always kind of
stragglers and we always push up against
the last minute but we try to avoid that
so um all right so I touched on this
article about the Nature Park and I'm
going to go to the deck now so I imagine
you've already seen this
oh we've got a uh another question can
you share the returns the other parks in
close proximity have IR and m o i so I
will have to email that out because I
don't have that prepared right now but
um Anders I commit to I will I'm
emailing this webinar out to everyone
whether they're here or not anyone that
rsvped so I will include the answer to
that um as well so I know I can tell you
that natalbany which is the park
right let me just do

[15:04]
[Music]
this if I'm spelling that
right I know the city it's
in so this park that we own in
Louisiana um obviously it's not that
close but it's called natal bany and
that was the first Park that I played a
role in with blue metric we closed on
February 20th uh TR typically first
distributions go out after the First
full quarter which is four days from now
uh we sent them out early yesterday we
always try to do that um and we met the
full PR we distributed to
$73,000 um that one is overperforming so
far um but yeah I accidentally lied I
thought this park was closer than almost
5 hours away and it is definitely not um
it is somewhere around here yeah there
it is that'll be

[16:00]
it is that'll be
this is the one of the two parks I
referred I'll try to get financials and
send that as well as the one in Western
Mississippi oh thanks for linking that
Jeff all right so I'll go to the deck um
that's a picture of this is the second
the uh east side of the park that I
showed you there's the air pillow down
there this big steel Buffalo that looks
really cool and then the bike park
entrance and stuff down there so it's a
$6.5 million raise we're also borrowing
6.5 million um as GPS we are putting in
collectively 10% uh that's the same with
every deal um the debt terms on the deal
it is floating rate but with a caling
and a floor so even at the ceiling uh
the numbers still work at 7.75% today
with a floor of 5% and a ceiling of 9%
um so we're borrowing 6 and A2 in debt
and 6 and2 have in equity which will

[17:00]
and 6 and2 have in equity which will
cover more than all of the value ad that
we're doing so we've never done a
capital call and we try to raise more
than we need so we don't ever have to do
a capital call um 10% preferred return
which is at the high end of what we
normally do um we're doing that because
this is a higher fund raise than what we
normally do um our biggest fund raise
ever was a couple months ago the park it
outside of Glacier National Park in
Montana uh that was a $6 million raise
and it is performing exceptionally well
so far um so we like these bigger raises
as long as we're able to buy at our you
know 9 to 12% cap rate which we were
able to do uh in both cases so 10%
preferred return that's usually eight uh
2.0 2x Target Equity multiple uh 25.6
Target irr um if you're unfamiliar with
irr that just accounts for the total
return looking back after we exit the
park either through refinance or a sale
um once again we've never missed um a
pref payment this will be our 21st or

[18:02]
pref payment this will be our 21st or
22nd Park um I've been in the RV mobile
home park business for five and a half
years I did it uh with two partners from
2019 to
2021 uh in Texas and Oklahoma and we
bought a slightly different asset class
smaller Parks um more long-term Parks
not really seasonal Parks we only bought
parks that didn't need an on-site
manager so we sold that whole portfolio
in 201 21 I started writing about it on
Twitter everything I learned um and then
blue metric I met the blue metric guys
last year we formed a friendship I liked
what they were doing and I joined them
as a cgp and I helped them with deal
sourcing most mostly passively people
will DM me off Market deals and then
with fundraising as well so I don't play
an operational role there um but I'm
talking to operations on a weekly basis
um mostly so I can find out how these
parks are do CU I like to they send

[19:01]
parks are do CU I like to they send
quarterly updates um blue metric does to
everyone I like to send monthly updates
to people that invest through me uh just
because transparently when you
overcommunication
and I'll get to that on this park here
in a moment um there will be 50 plus
sometimes closer to 62% bonus
depreciation a year one that goes to
investors first um there has been recent
legislation that will drop that down
starting
2025 um and so that stinks but it is
what it is um I'm going to skip over
some of these Decks that are just kind
of
informational so this talks about the
location uh of God's country which I

[20:00]
location uh of God's country which I
already touched on 89% occupancy rate
that's a blended rate between um the
short-term rentals the cabins the
glamping and the RV pads the RV pads
have closer to 100% occupancy rate and
the glamping and cabins have closer to
60% occupancy rate which is the main
reason why we're prioritizing expanding
the pad sites as opposed to more um
cabins are glamping but we think that
once we add everything to Airbnb uh and
hip camp and Camp spot uh that will be
an immediate lift in occupancy but we're
not really accounting for that in the um
in the underwriting that will just be a
kind of a
bonus um okay so Revenue per site
11,500 which is a great number because
it typically costs if we were to build a
park from scratch today between 15 on a
very very low end to 35 Grand per pad um
to build new pads so when you have
12,000 Revenue Vue per site per year um

[21:01]
12,000 Revenue Vue per site per year um
that's a pretty pretty quick pay payback
period
um we're going to add 75 RV sites in
total over the next five years assuming
that's going to be in phases assuming
that the phases go well and that we're
being able to keep them mostly occupied
um that will more than double the noi uh
of the park today we got someone
joining um
we the debt service coverage ratio dscr
is 1.57 today we project that to be
closer to three uh by year three because
most of the value ad uh will be
completed by year three um Danny the the
pride of ownership and attention to
detail that we see in his Park you know
with the the keypad at the gate and the
heated toilets and all these intangibles
the grass stain cut that is also shown
in his recordkeeping and his financials
so he has very clean records uh which is
very appreciated
um occupancy proximity nearby

[22:02]
um occupancy proximity nearby
attractions I already talked about all
that that's the game room glamping TPS
that is the playground before he added
the shade cover the pool uh the kids
play area the uh pool tables um this
just kind of talks about high level of
the park
shreport um this is kind of what our
whole um strategy is at Blue metric we
don't Outsource our our management we're
all vertically integrated we don't
Outsource our development of course we
use subcontractors but J D is a
full-time employee of ours and that's a
very big part of our strategy is to buy
properties that have vacant land um and
strong occupancy and poor marketing
right those three ingredients are the
recipe for Success increase the
marketing increase the pad sites
increase the occupancy uh and with more
pad sites more noi hopefully that's just
kind of an chart uh this talks about the

[23:00]
kind of an chart uh this talks about the
RV sector um and how it's been growing
uh there's been a lot of Trends in you
know postco trends that shows the
pendulum kind of Shifting away from
being indoors the pendulum shifting away
from being on our phones are on screens
all the time and people are getting out
more um national parks are swamped more
than they ever have been and that is not
going away state parks are swamped U so
we like buying parks that are near state
parks near National parks near a major
lake not just any Lake but a big
attraction Lake um or at least on the
way to those things which is similar to
what bies does actually um this is why
we like RV parks you know everything's
getting rolled up by private Equity
everything will be rolled up eventually
I just heard a podcast about the guy
that rolled up 53 music schools in
Denver sold it for $42 million nothing
is immune from the rollup and RV parks
are certainly no exception we like this
size of R Park a lot because it's kind

[24:01]
size of R Park a lot because it's kind
of in the messy Middle where you've got
retail buying you know 0 to two million
dollar Parks you've got black Zone
private Equity they've been in the
mobile home park game for about 10 years
they're starting to get involved in the
RV park game but they don't spend six
million at a time um they really don't
even spend 10 million at a time they buy
really really big parks um so we're kind
of in that messy Middle where we're able
to get good cap rates and um it's been
strong um it's been strong for a while
it won't last forever of course nothing
ever does um will it last for six more
months or six more years I don't know
but while it's around we're going to
keep buying and we're actually pretty
careful about where we buy I talked
about national parks and state parks and
attractions but we don't really Buy in
Texas uh we have a couple in Oklahoma
because Texas is so liberal with what
they allow people to build it's kind of
an oxymoron it's a very it's a
especially the rural parts of Texas is a
very red State um and so they're very

[25:01]
very red State um and so they're very
open to zoning and if you've ever driven
through Houston you'll know what I'm
talking about Texas is loose with zoning
and so we're afraid that if we buy we
just looked at a deal in abene Texas
that was a 13 cap in a big Park really
nice uh and we passed
because we could literally have three
competitors right next door by the end
of next year and that scares the crap
out of us frankly so uh we're trying to
to buy in Supply constrained areas um
that will be Supply constrained in the
near future we're not against Texas if
we were to find an RV park within City
Limits that had already grandfathered in
that Park um it's easier to find mobile
home parks like that than it is to find
RV parks um unless you're they're
long-term RV parks and we're really more
after U parks that could be long-term as
a hedge against a down economy but that
are more seasonal Andor
shortterm um this is our track record
it's a little outdated um John my

[26:01]
it's a little outdated um John my
partner the founder of blue metric has
been in commercial real estate either as
an investor or as an attorney for 20
years um undergrad at Duke Law School at
Michigan smart guy been involved with
several startups uh fun fact he's one of
the founders of Mental Floss which uh I
didn't even know until we drove to
shreport together last week um good guy
smart guy um and then I've been buying
real estate in some form or fashion for
for 15 years I started in college buying
single family um single family in
Tuscaloosa Alabama and Huntsville
Alabama and then I moved to Texas it's
bought my first RV Park in CA Oklahoma
population
732 uh learned a lot of lessons the hard
way um so I've only been in the RV
mobile park space for five and a half
years but I've been in real estate
investing for about 14 or 15 um so we
slbl metric have bought
about $50 million worth of parks and um

[27:04]
about $50 million worth of parks and um
they're worth today you know over the
last 21 months and today they're worth
between 80 and 90 million um so we try
to buy right but also have a lot of
value at levers left to pull um this is
a map of our Parks uh the one outlier
here and Glacier National Park that was
worth it um because it could be a $20
million Park that we bought for 8
million and it is very very very Supply
constrained and we're buying the raw
land next door to actually expand that
but we did take an expense ratio hit we
took an noi hit the first year because
we replaced the owners with an expensive
employee that is only managing that Park
and so we get a couple more Parks over
there great um but even with the noi hit
that we took it's worth buying so other
than that we're primarily in the
Southeast we like all of the states that
are touching Tennessee uh Plus Tennessee
um Oklahoma was kind of an outlier

[28:00]
um Oklahoma was kind of an outlier
because we found someone with three
parks and it was a great deal and we
bought all three of them so we're able
to put one manager in Oklahoma
so um this is the whole plan right buy a
property year one at a 9 to 12% cap rate
that has room to expand uh that has not
been marketing well but still has strong
occupancy um we want to refinance by
year three uh return most or all of
invest or Capital but keep them in the
deal uh perpetually for quote infinite
returns we don't plan to sell individual
Parks oneoff because the whole play here
is to aggregate everything to compress
the cap rate down from 12 to five or six
uh and to exit to private Equity one day
hopefully um if not then we'll have
strong noi strong cash flow um and so if
you're an LP that joined us on day one
or if you're an LP that joined us the
day before we sell um everyone will
benefit from even having an ownership in

[29:00]
benefit from even having an ownership in
one park that is combined with all of
the parks and enjoys a compressed pratic
cap rate so we've yet to refinance a
park we've gotten some offers at you
know decent offers 70% LTV even up to
75% % debt it just hasn't made sense
like the you know rates haven't come
down it hasn't made sense to refinance
but we know that we we could we just
haven't yet so I just wanted to cave out
that that is the plan but we have yet to
actually refinance the park
um so that's the Grand Lodge I was
talking about 10% preferred returns
talked about that already these are our
debt terms I talked about that um
quarterly
distributions uh
so the investors get up to you know 100%
of the first 10% return 60% of you know
the first 15% from 10 to 15% and then
50/50 after 15%

[30:02]
50/50 after 15%
irr
um 50% minimum accredited only uh we are
very strict about that um these are the
financials so Danny did 836k last year
in noi uh we're projecting a drop this
year uh because we're replacing the
owner the owner is the manager here
we're replacing him with a manager and
so the expense ratio will go from 32 to
39% and then we will see it drop over
time as we add more gross revenue and I
don't even think we're we're like
accounting or underwriting for adding
more parks in the area we're just
accounting for the park being ran more
efficiently as the the Top Line grows so
there's some financials there this kind
of talks about our our schedule for uh
when we're going to roll out more pad
sites um this is what projected returns
look like on a $100,000 invest M um you
can see the refinance pop right there so

[31:01]
can see the refinance pop right there so
in this case if things go well lots of
ifs um the investor will receive more
than what they put in uh by year three
but then stay in the deal for continued
returns um talked about that and that's
the
team and that is it let me see if I I
have more notes I see there's a few
questions so let me go back to my notes
to see if I missed anything
so yeah we're also not accounting for
occupancy increasing because of the bike
park like we that's not in the
financials it's not in the projections
the projections look like our other
Parks projections we're just banking on
our Playbook we've never bought a park
that was about to have a bike park go in
next door uh maybe the bike park really

[32:01]
next door uh maybe the bike park really
doesn't affect things much you know
maybe it's a dud uh so we're not
accounting for that in the financials
but we we're fairly confident that it
will affect our occupancy in a good way
um yeah I think that's all I have so let
me go to the
questions here only have
three does the 25% irr take into account
all the projected additions RV sides yes
uh yes it does it includes all that
expansion do you build the cabins
in-house as well it depends um typically
not so we actually just bought 48 um
Fort Wilderness cabins from Disney I say
cabins it's a single wide mobile home
that has like a a cabin facade on the
outside we just placed the first one at
our park in the Smoky Mountains Peace
Valley and the other 47 uh we're going
to place all over the country Montana
Mississippi Tennessee all over um we are

[33:01]
Mississippi Tennessee all over um we are
always open to new like affordable
housing options we're looking at these
things called bunes made in Canada there
are 15,000 for one Park um we're looking
at ever rooms which one of our CPS owns
a tiny like a luxury tiny home company
those will be more Lakeside those cost
150,000 um and then we're looking at
things that cost 15,000 and then things
that cost 47 or 48,000 like the Fort
Wilderness happin so um we we're doing
the primitive campsites ourselves
because that's easy um in Montana we
just added plug-and-play cabins that
were locally built so as I'm talking
myself through this I don't I don't
think we're building these cabins
ourselves I can't think of an instance
where we built them ourselves from the
ground up we typically buying them and
placing them on
site all right uh what are the main
risks with this property what would be
the irr in this scenario great question

[34:00]
the irr in this scenario great question
so the biggest risk that we see in all
of our
properties is capex and expense ratio
being not what we project so we did have
the second Park we ever bought is called
Newport um it was we we didn't we were
not thorough enough on our electrical
inspection um and we ended up having to
close a third of the park because the
electrical was insufficient thought it
was 50 amp it was 30 amp um and so that
the repairs were you know 20 $330,000
which didn't completely ruin everything
but what really hurt our performas were
closing down a third of the park for
months um and so we're since much more
we've since been much more thorough on
our electrical inspections that's the
biggest miss that we've had um of all
the parks in our portfolio we we don't
have any that will be like a complete
loser um the Newport Park is behind
projections on the noi but the investors

[35:01]
projections on the noi but the investors
will still come out ahead in the end
we're turning it around but all that to
be said um there's always a risk with
the septic or you wastewater treatment
plant whatever it is like one of the
biggest questions that we have to fix uh
or answer when we buy a park is how do
we get the poop out right like that is
always one of the biggest problems if
it's on City Water great if if it's on
wellwater that's usually fine too um
waste is always uh an issue expense
ratio not being what we expect is an
issue um owner not disclosing everything
uh and us not learning things until
after we buy the park that's an issue
things that are not issues that we find
in other asset classes um we don't
really have occupancy issues in any of
our Parks which I really like that not
being a core risk it's of course a risk
you you could always happen usually it
happens when you buy a park and the new
Supply enters the market which is what
we're trying to control for um the great

[36:02]
we're trying to control for um the great
thing about this asset class is that
when the economy is strong you have more
people buying RVs more people traveling
therefore more short-term tenants
short-term tenants are much more
profitable especially when you already
have a park manager on site that can
manage them if you have or if you're
already paying someone to manage them
then you want as many nightly tenants as
you have as you can have because they
pay 60 to 100 tonight whereas a monthly
tenant will pay 700 for a month right so
three times the gross revenue from a
nightly tenant so things are really good
when the econom is good and you have
more profitable nightly tenants when the
economy sours which eventually of course
will um people are buying less RVs uh
and they're living in their RVs
full-time which I think most Americans
don't even realize how many millions of
Americans live in their RVs for years at
a time that's why long-term RV parks
exist and so when the economy sour then
you can convert and I use that word very

[37:00]
you can convert and I use that word very
Loosely because there's no conversion
process that happens you just naturally
attract more tenants that want to stay
on a monthly basis and in that case
you're more primed to have good
occupancy because you have all these
amenities that are pointed toward
short-term tenants whereas a more um
like a long-term park down the road that
was more geared towards long-term Park
tenants they don't have all those
amenities because typically long-term
Parks don't have have as many amenities
and so it's a hedge against the economy
um natural disasters those are always a
risk of course especially in places like
Louisiana flooding um of course is a
risk but we have insurance that protects
us of course against damage liability
and loss of income for up to a year and
so all that to be said the the biggest
risks are usually capex uh
related and Opex
related and what would the irr do in
that scenario
um it would just be lower than projected

[38:01]
um it would just be lower than projected
um I don't know exactly what what it
could be it could be a wide range of
things uh Andre says what rate
projections are you making for the
refinance in year three and the sale in
year five rate projections you make for
the refinance in year three in the sale
in year
five um that's good question I
think I I'm almost positive we're not
underwriting for big rate drops um I
believe we're underwriting for 7 to 9%
rates at at refinance um year five
you yeah I I don't think we're
projecting anything for year five with
regards to rates being higher or lower
we think the most likely uh scenario is
just a total buyout because that's what
we've seen happen in the
industry all right well I don't see any
questions I'll give you guys another
minute or so to ask them but if you are
interested I I put a link at the top of

[39:01]
interested I I put a link at the top of
the comments to the investor portal you
can make an account you can show Soft
commitment there's no obligation to
invest until you've signed all of the
ppms and loan docs um you can find the
ppms and Loan docks um in the portal as
well um and you can email me Chris coof
founders.com with any questions we' love
to have you at the inperson tour 8: a.m.
next Saturday uh July 7th I think um I
will be there with Danny the owner and
um yeah we can go from there I will also
email this out to everyone if you want
to uh someone's total weirdo and wants
to rewatch this uh Jeff says when you
sell in five years as a bundle to PE or
someone else how is the return for this
specific Park expected to be calculated
some cap rate uh calculation yes so what
we've seen this is kind of an assumption
because we don't have anyone with an
offer right right now but what we've
seen happen in the industry does others
um is you you basically assign a cap

[40:01]
um is you you basically assign a cap
rate to the whole asset uh and then that
cap rate carries down on a park by Park
basis and so it would be a very tedious
process of taking all the parks and
saying all right this investor put in 50
Grand into this park this park now
enjoys a 6 and a half% cap rate because
it's part of everything and so this
investor his ownership is 1% yada y yada
his return would be X Y or z uh so
if there are no other questions uh thank
you for joining if this is part of a big
winner and there's another one as a
moderate winner this park will have a
lower return potentially let me read
that again so if this park is a big
winner and there's another one as a
moderate winner this park would have a
lower yeah I mean yeah honestly it's
it's it's just going to be an average um
that that could happen but obviously if
we had one loser in the portfolio it
wouldn't wouldn't move the needle as
much as if you were invested in one park
and it was a big winner and the other 20

[41:00]
and it was a big winner and the other 20
or 30 were all losers that would of
course that would drag you down that is
a downside um
yeah okay well thank you all for joining
