[00:00]
Most of everything is not on the
internet, believe it or not. But that's
like the most valuable stuff. They
charge between $50 and $100 a week to
service these. They were here for 5
minutes. They do 25 a day in the middle
of nowhere, Idaho. I am so hyped on this
idea. And someone needs to copy this.
You know those little inner tubes you
buy on Amazon? 15 bucks. $95 to rent an
inner tube from Maxin. This is a
three-hour rental. They send two letters
per month to people paying $10 per month
that tell a story. We're talking 310
grand a month.
&gt;&gt; What? They're not doing paid ads. It's
just word of mouth.
&gt;&gt; I almost don't want to release this
podcast episode cuz they're going to get
freaking destroyed.
&gt;&gt; So, I'm sitting in my Airbnb. My wife
takes the kids to go see some friends. I
got the whole day to work. So, I'm
thinking, what can I film? I want to
film some content about small
businesses. And I see this hot tub out
here. thinking, "Oh, that guy Austin on
Twitter, he has a hot tub maintenance
business where he only services Airbnbs.

[01:00]
business where he only services Airbnbs.
That could be cool. I could do a video
on that." So, I'm kind of writing it up.
I'm scripting it. And then in the front
yard, I see someone pull up a white van.
I'm thinking, "Who's this? Is this the
cleaner? Cuz I'm here for three more
days. Why is the cleaner here?" Guess
who it was, Nick?
&gt;&gt; I don't know. It's the hot tub servicing
business. They pulled up right at the
same moment that I was trying to make
content about hot tub servicing.
&gt;&gt; Hm. I'm sorry.
&gt;&gt; So, what am I going to do? Do I have any
option but to go out there?
&gt;&gt; You've reached a whole new level, Chris,
of influencer. You influenced the
universe to send hot tub maintenance
people to your house. That's how much of
an influencer you are right now.
&gt;&gt; What can I say? So, I go out there on
the deck. I surprise these two girls.
They're probably 16, 17 years old.
Sisters, I think their dad owns a
business. And this business does two
things. They do hot tub maintenance and
servicing for short-term rental owners.
And they do hot tub moving because guess

[02:01]
And they do hot tub moving because guess
what? A retail business that sells hot
tubs. They don't want to move the
things. They don't have the equipment.
They don't want to be in the logistics
business, the delivery business. So,
this company moves all of them for them.
&gt;&gt; First of all, that's one of the most
Mormon things that I've ever heard. like
their dad owns the business and they're
coming out to service your hot tub.
Like, oh, how's it going, brother
Corner? Yeah, dad sent us here. Sounds
like there must might be a maintenance
issue. Do you mind if we have a word of
prayer before we start?
Like, okay, the word prayer was a joke
at the end of that. But like, but like
seriously, how many Mormon entrepreneurs
are there that have their kids working
for them? Dude, that's like genius. I
love it.
&gt;&gt; I know. I know. And so I start picking
their brain and they're doing they do 25
hot tubs a day. A day in the middle of
nowhere Idaho. They charge between $50
and $100 a week to service these. They
were here for 5 minutes. And that
includes the time that I spent peppering
them with questions. So I spent the next
three hours down a rabbit hole

[03:00]
three hours down a rabbit hole
researching all types of like hot tub
related businesses. Hot tub moving, hot
tub maintenance repairs, hot tub cover
sales. And two days ago, I posted that
whole deep dive on the podcast and I
just love the hot tub business. Now,
&gt;&gt; what would you start? Like, of those
businesses that you just mentioned,
which one would you start?
&gt;&gt; You know, I want to say hot tub
maintenance and servicing. That was my
number one. But the more I ponder it,
the more I think I like the moving
business more.
&gt;&gt; You were thinking about hot tubs. I
think you and I have talked about this
idea before, but I just got reminded of
it. I was up at Lake Cascade. Oh, dude,
it was so beautiful. You know, Owen,
he's got a a big company. He's been
super successful. He's he has a a cabin
on the lake in Cascade. He's got a boat
and um beautiful. But in order for us to
go up there, it was a family reunion.
What did we have to do? Everybody had to
buy their own food. We had to go up
there early to gas up the boat and the
jet skis. And we had to make sure that
everything was perfect in the backyard.
We had to stock the fridge. After we got

[04:00]
We had to stock the fridge. After we got
done, we had to, you know, take the
stuff off of the the bedding, yada yada
yada. And it just reminded me of this
idea that I've had for a couple of years
where I think that there's an
opportunity for somebody to create a
concierge
prep service for rich people. Because if
someone came to my brother-in-law and
was like, "Hey, look, just text us
before you come up. We'll gas we'll gas
up the boats. We'll gas up the jet skis.
We'll make sure that they're serviced
and and maintained. We'll clean up the
yard a little bit. We'll stock the
fridge with what you want. and we'll
charge you, you know, whatever a,000
bucks to do that plus cost in a
heartbeat. I know in a heartbeat my
brother-in-law would do that. And I just
think anybody who's got a lakehouse or,
you know, has enough money to have a
lakehouse would pay to do that. Who
would not like why would you not do
that? And I don't know why there isn't a
service that exists like that. I love
it. We did the same thing. We rented a
boat on Bear Lake on July 3rd and we had
the same thing. We rented it, right?
Right? So, it was different scenario,
but it took us an hour to like sign the
waiverss and fill up the tube and learn

[05:01]
waiverss and fill up the tube and learn
how to do it. And we could have skipped
all that. Like, we could have done that
before we went. So, I feel like there's
also a SAS play here where you could
build something. You could vibe code
something that these boat rental places
pay for monthly to help streamline the
waiver process, the learning process.
Like, take this video, check the box
that you learned how to start it, how to
back it up. Yeah. Then you just show up
and go, you know,
&gt;&gt; and there's like two ways to do it.
There's the one way, which is like, hey,
I'm starting this business and I'm going
to go actually do the fulfillment,
right? I'm going to gas up the jet skis.
I'm going to stock the fridge. I'm going
to get the beds ready, etc. Flyers would
be perfect. I'm just going to go to each
one of these houses and I'm going to set
flyers and, you know, might take a
couple months for the owner to actually
come up and see that. But I think that
would be a fairly easy way to get
customers. And then on the back end to
your idea, let's say that you're a boat
rental place. You do the same thing. You
just drop the flyer off and say, "Hey,
if you want to come rent a boat, scan
this QR code, fill out all the stuff
before you come." And it's like now when
you go to Enterprise or you go to Hertz

[06:01]
you go to Enterprise or you go to Hertz
where you don't have to interact with an
agent, you just show up, grab a car, and
leave. Like, why don't they why don't we
have the same processes for going and
renting things. It seems like such an
easy lowhanging fruit.
&gt;&gt; That's an interesting framework now that
I think of it is like find an
established industry like car rentals,
been around forever. Look at the
features and the offerings that are just
now starting to come out such as, you
know, no need to check in. Just walk up
to your car and leave. Okay, that's
innovative. That's new. Take that same
feature to like a subindustry of that
like boat, ATVs, we're renting a
sidebyside tomorrow. Insert anything
rentals and just implement that like as
a service, right? And then offer that
service to to the companies.
&gt;&gt; Dude, that would be a genius idea.
Paddle boards, skin boards.
&gt;&gt; Mhm. like anything boat kayaks, anything
boat related near a lake. It's
touchless. Okay, cool. I'll go. Yep.
This is what I'm picking up. I mean, you
do that all the time with Uber Eats,
right? Like, there's got to be some way
for them to have compliance where they

[07:01]
for them to have compliance where they
come in and they just grab the food and
go. Side note, for example, anytime we
go to a Chipotle, Chris makes this joke.
Anytime if anybody ever goes with Chris
to Chipotle anytime he's ordering and
he's like, "Oh, hey, why don't we just
grab some food from the free food rack?"
&gt;&gt; The free shelf. The Chipotle free shelf.
Okay,
&gt;&gt; that's the Chipotle free shelf. It's
where, you know, Uber Uber drivers, Uber
Eat drivers come to pick up the food for
their orders. But yeah, why would they
not do that at the lake for any rentals?
&gt;&gt; Why not, dude? I think I've spent half
of my summer inflating paddle boards and
it's the worst experience in the world.
It's terrible.
&gt;&gt; Can someone invent a paddle board that
has an integrated electric pump? You
just press a button, it pumps it up to
the right PSI, and then you you're done.
You press a button and it deflates it.
Because they have electric pumps, you
hook it up to your car. They're so slow.
Like, if we have integrated electric
pumps on our air mattresses, just do it
on a paddle board. Oh, it's water. Dude,

[08:00]
on a paddle board. Oh, it's water. Dude,
stop. We can put freaking rovers on
Mars. We can figure out how to
waterproof an electric pump. Okay, I can
just hear the haters. Someone please
make a paddle board. It takes 30 minutes
to fill those things up. It's the worst.
So, here's how this works. I make you
free videos. I actually know what I'm
talking about. I have no greasy sales
pitch at the end. And if you implement
what I talk about, you'll make a lot
more money and have a better life. And
all I ask for in return is that you hit
the subscribe button and maybe even the
notification bell, just like that. Thank
you.
&gt;&gt; I actually really like that framework.
Go to places that are vacation
destinations.
and find those businesses who are
renting out things to people. Like it
doesn't just have to be lake related
things. It could be skis. It could, you
know, anything like that. And be like,
"Hey, this is going to make your service
even better. It's touchless. You're
going to eliminate the number of
employees who need to have people come
check in, all of that stuff, and then
implement it as a SAS product." Why
would you not do that?
&gt;&gt; No, dude. Speaking of renting stuff in a
vacation destination,

[09:00]
vacation destination,
&gt;&gt; talk about a monopoly. If I were to buy
a business, I think I would buy a
business like this. I'm going to give
you two examples, okay? Island Park,
Idaho. Population 236. But in the
summertime and in the winter time for
skiing, it booms. It's exploding, right?
All you all there is here are like two
gas stations, a subway, and a grocery
store. But it's packed with people. It
is a hidden gem. Okay.
&gt;&gt; Crappy cabin up in the woods. 800 grand.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. For those who don't know, it's
like what, an hour from Yellowstone?
&gt;&gt; It's like 30 minutes from Yellowstone.
We were at Yellowstone yesterday.
Anyway, they have this float on the
Henry's Fourth River, right? It's a
two-hour float and there's this hotel
right on the river called Max in Ma K
apostrophe S. Maxin. And they rent stuff
that you can use to float down the
river. Maybe an inner tube, kayak,
paddle board, and a raft. Okay. Now, we
brought our own stuff because your boy's
cheap, right? And we we rented it from

[10:00]
cheap, right? And we we rented it from
the BYU like BYU Idaho equipment center
which is like $2 a week. It's it's
honestly a joke how cheap it is there
which it has to be that cheap or they
would have no business, right?
&gt;&gt; Oh my gosh. Yes.
&gt;&gt; There's so many jokes you want to make
right now.
&gt;&gt; There's so many jokes. Like how far is
BYU Idaho from from Eagle Park or Eagle
Island?
&gt;&gt; Island Park. It's an hour.
&gt;&gt; It's an hour. Yeah. So Chris goes and
rents and drives with all that stuff.
Well, we were in Rexburg. We were in
Rexburg, so we picked them up and we
drove off.
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; but then we stayed because that this was
our next stop. This is how much they
charge max in. This is what a legal
monopoly looks like. This is what a moat
looks like. Okay.
&gt;&gt; Mhm. Mhm.
&gt;&gt; You know those little inner tubes you
buy on Amazon 15 bucks, right? You go
floating down a river, you rent them for
$5 for a day. That's common price. $95
to rent an inner tube from Max in $95.
&gt;&gt; What? Stand up paddle board, $105. One
kayak, $130. Canoe, $170.

[11:02]
kayak, $130. Canoe, $170.
This is a three-hour rental.
&gt;&gt; That's what we call surge pricing.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But all the time three-hour
rental, not even an all day rental.
&gt;&gt; That's insane, dude.
&gt;&gt; Is that insane?
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Talk about profit, right? And this place
in Bear Lake, where we rented a boat,
their domain name, bearlake rentals.com.
All right. Right. And for those
unfamiliar, Bear Lake is a huge vacation
destination for people in Utah, Idaho,
all over, right? Imagine buying that
boomerowned business, Bearlake
Rentals.com, with their own marina right
there, right in the center of
everything. Is that thing ever going out
of business?
&gt;&gt; No. Like, you'd really have to screw it
up. Like, what's going to disrupt boat
rentals? You know what I'm saying? Like,
not AI, not a competitor that has the
location, it has the domain name, it has
the 30-year history. I love these
businesses,
&gt;&gt; dude. They're amazing. I I just talked
to a guy who's under LOI for a
&gt;&gt; sign printing and maintenance business.
&gt;&gt; Like that's his whole business is

[12:00]
&gt;&gt; Like that's his whole business is
&gt;&gt; not just sign printing. I'm sorry. Sign
creation. So
&gt;&gt; it's not just billboards, but it's like
custom whatever. I don't even know. Neon
signs, etc.
&gt;&gt; That's not going out of business.
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry. Do people still have eyes? Do
they still make impulse buys? Like Yeah.
That business is going to be around for
a long time. Okay. I think it's going to
be Yeah. Yeah, I think I think that'll
do it.
&gt;&gt; Freaking love businesses like
&gt;&gt; So, we got watercraft rental businesses.
We got watercraft service businesses.
We've talked about watercraft SAS
businesses that you could vibe code.
Once again, I really like hot tub
maintenance to Airbnb owners, hot tub
rentals to Airbnb owners, and hot tub
moving for hot tub retail businesses.
You could just be their logistical arm.
It costs 600 bucks to move a hot tub.
Can I pitch an idea that I'm having
right now for like a mastermind getaway?
How cool would it be in the summer to
just get whatever a group of guys and
gals who are entrepreneurial go to Eagle

[13:00]
gals who are entrepreneurial go to Eagle
Island, not Eagle Island, whatever,
Island Park. Yeah. Anywhere, anywhere
that's a vacation destination, and be
like, "All right, we have a competition.
There are five teams. Whoever can think
of and execute the best business model
in the next seven days and make the most
money wins.
&gt;&gt; Like in-person businesses.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Like think about Bear Lake
rentals, right? Yes. They're selling
boat rentals or even or even the one um
in Island Park inner tubes, paddle
boards, etc. Okay, cool. You go there
for one day, you see what the pricing
is, and you're like, "All right, I'm
going to go drive and buy 10 inner
tubes, and I'm not going to sell them
for 95 an hour. I'm going to sell them
for 55 an hour and I'm going to make a
homemade sign and I'm going to do it
down the road. Like for people like you
and I, like that would just be fun. That
would be the vacation is like you're in
a cool place, you're thinking of an
idea, you go out, you execute it and
it's like within a week, who can
actually launch this and make the most
money? That would be, dude, that would
be freaking fun.
&gt;&gt; It's like, you know, the pendulum going
towards AI and all that. It would be
going the opposite direction and doing
an in-person hackathon. A local business

[14:02]
an in-person hackathon. A local business
hackathon,
&gt;&gt; dude. Yes. A real world hackathon.
&gt;&gt; That's what it is. Yeah, for real
business.
&gt;&gt; Okay, cool.
&gt;&gt; Well, and it's like, all right, don't
buy my course. I'm not going to show you
how to do start a business. Don't come
to my mastermind that's going to be in a
boardroom for the next, you know, 3
days, 10 hours a day. No, we're going to
go get a cabin and guess what? You're
going to launch a business. And maybe
you put like a, I don't know, camp
counselor, quote unquote, in each team
that knows that you trust that you've
like actually seen that, you know, could
act, you know, Sam Thompson would be one
of them.
&gt;&gt; And it's like, cool, let's go. Let's go
figure it out. Whoever went to that
would learn more in five days or or
whatever in one day than they would in
any freaking classroom setting because
you're going to get your hands dirty.
You're like actually trying to charge
money.
&gt;&gt; Just imagine like a a group of guys
sitting there. They're on their
MacBooks. You've got partnerships of
like two or three people and then one of
them just stands up to leave like where
are they going? Oh my gosh, I heard them
talking about inner tubes. Oh, okay.
Let's do inner tube. Where are they
going? Oh, I heard them talking about
selling waters. You know what I'm

[15:00]
selling waters. You know what I'm
saying? Like
&gt;&gt; dude, that would be fun.
&gt;&gt; That would be super fun. really fun.
&gt;&gt; We could film the whole thing and
actually have it be like a season. Just
call it hackathon.
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; That would be so fun. Hey, sorry I'm
getting off topic here. But
&gt;&gt; I would cool.
&gt;&gt; I got an idea for you. You ready?
&gt;&gt; Okay. Yep.
&gt;&gt; I got this email from a guy Connor
Brereslin. So, shout out to him. I'm
going to read this to you and I I want
to hear your your real time thoughts.
Okay.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Hey, Chris. I thought you'd appreciate
this cold email idea. It's a bit wild,
but kind of ingenious. It's inspired by
your one-scent PayPal trick. Send
someone a scent and PayPal nags them to
open an account and then you can put
your your cold email message to them in
the message when you send them the one
cent and then they'll see that message
over and over from PayPal. Right? Here's
the angle. Shopify order confirmation
emails almost always land in the primary
inbox. Not spam, not promotions, even if
you've never interacted with the sender.
That's because these emails come from
Shopify's central infrastructure, not

[16:01]
Shopify's central infrastructure, not
from the merchants's domain, which would
probably be less trusted by your inbox.
So, what if instead of cold emailing
highv value targets and risking spam
filters, you use Shopify? Say you're
Chris Kerner trying to get in front of
100 top real estate CEOs about stump
grinding. You set up a Shopify store.
Use an import plugin to manually create
100 orders, which I've done. It's very
simple. Mark them as paid. It could be a
free ebook, guide, anything. And trigger
the order confirmation email. Now that
email lands right in their primary
inbox. They're curious. What did I just
buy? They open. Boom. It's a tailored
message like outsource your stump
grinding. We handle it all. Click below
for a quote. It's not for everyone, but
it might just work.
&gt;&gt; I don't know this space well enough. So,
how would you have it be generated from
Shopify? Like using how would you
piggyback off of their infrastructure?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. You just make a CSV with
like dummy orders. You take all your
emails of your target. You put that
under email and then you don't need a

[17:01]
under email and then you don't need a
lot else in there. You can put in a
price, a product name. Product name
could be like outsource stump grinding.
It's kind of like for like for our
vending business if we had a big big
customer place a manual order. They're
like, I don't want to pay the Shopify
fees. I don't want you to pay the fees.
Give me a 5% discount and I'll just send
you a wire. So you make manual invoices.
you can convert those invoices to a CSV.
You still want them in Shopify because
all your reporting is pulled from
Shopify. So, you just upload the CSV and
then boom,
&gt;&gt; you can see them now in Shopify and
instead of saying like placed on
website, it just says like manual
import.
&gt;&gt; So, you would do that with any dummy
product.
&gt;&gt; You like turning Shopify into your own
CRM
&gt;&gt; into your own like
&gt;&gt; like in a weird way
&gt;&gt; outbound cold email agent CRMish. Yeah,
&gt;&gt; cuz this is piggybacking. You're just
you're effectively just borrowing
Shopify's infrastructure in order to get
in the
&gt;&gt; and their trust.
&gt;&gt; And their trust. Yeah. And
&gt;&gt; you're I mean you're doing three things
at once. Instead of using hundreds of
dollars per month cold emailing

[18:00]
dollars per month cold emailing
software, you're using Shopify, which is
like 39 a month. You're saving money.
Number two, you're landing in the inbox,
which is a cheat code because that's the
hardest part of cold emailing. Okay.
Number three, you're standing out even
more because it looks like an order
confirmation email, right? Okay. And in
the age of AI, to be successful at cold
email, you're going to have to be more
creative than ever. So, I can't think of
an industry where this wouldn't work.
&gt;&gt; How quickly do you get shut down by
Shopify?
&gt;&gt; TBD.
&gt;&gt; I mean,
&gt;&gt; we'll see.
&gt;&gt; Chris Kerner, who's been shut down by
more service providers than he can
count. Surely they would like catch on
to you pretty quickly and shut you down.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, you get a new Shopify account.
&gt;&gt; Oh, I'm sorry. Do you just give up when
the first roadblock hits you? Huh? NGMI,
bro.
&gt;&gt; 30-day free trial. 30-day free trial to
Shopify. They shut you down on day 21.
Get a new account.
&gt;&gt; Dude, I mean, you know this. I love
piggybacking. I think that's a freaking
great piggyback idea.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I would love for someone to try
this and let us know.
&gt;&gt; I mean, that's what you've been good at

[19:00]
&gt;&gt; I mean, that's what you've been good at
ever since I've known you is by
leveraging non-traditional
marketing funnels, and this would be one
of those channels. I think that's a
freaking amazing idea.
&gt;&gt; Amen, brother. All right. What you got?
&gt;&gt; All right. So, you and I have talked
about starting AI agencies in the past,
and I just talked to somebody today that
kind of blew my mind. You've heard of a
directory, right?
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; I have a directory idea for you, too, by
the way.
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay. So, for those who are
listening, directories are basically
like Yelp meets Craigslist.
&gt;&gt; It's not a super sexy website, but it
has all the information that you need.
And it's super hot right now in our
space because you can use AI to build
directories easier than you ever have
been able to in the past. And now lots
of people are building directories.
Well, I talked to this guy today on my
podcast, Nickonomics. He has a
healthcare company. And what he's done
is he's built a directory. It's actually
an ABA directory. Chris, applied
behavioral analysis.
&gt;&gt; Autism clinics. And what he's doing with
that is he's using that as a lead
generation source for the clinics, not

[20:02]
generation source for the clinics, not
for patients. I mean, although it will
function as that. So, what he's doing is
he's created a directory with all of the
ABA clinics around the country. Then,
what he's going to do is reach out to
them via cold email.
&gt;&gt; Okay, quick pause. What if you had an
employee who worked 24/7 answering
leads, building funnels, tracking
conversions, and you didn't even have to
pay them a salary? Well, that's exactly
what you get with Highle's new AI
employee. And right now, they're giving
you 30 days free as part of their summer
of AI promo. And after that, it's just
97 bucks a month, way less than you'd
ever pay a human. And it doesn't even
ask for lunch breaks or vacation time.
So check out the link in the description
below and let AI handle all the grind
for you. And with that cold email, he's
going to introduce himself and say,
"Hey, you're on my directory. Check it
out. If you want to rank higher, you
know, let me know." but basically get
them to buy in to his directory and see
that this is another place where they
can get patients from because he's

[21:00]
can get patients from because he's
currently getting 90% of his leads from
a directory like he's on the receiving
end of
&gt;&gt; Mhm. And he is he has his own digital
marketing agency where after he builds a
directory and he does the cold email
outreach and people come on he's then
going to pitch them his digital agency
services. Well, hey, since you're here
now, I I could also do pay-per-click for
you. I could also do SEO for you. I
could also do, you know, a bunch of
other things. I thought it was one of
the most creative lead generation ideas
that I've heard in a long time where
you're, yes, you're building a
directory, but you're not just
monetizing based on the traffic that
comes to the directory or by selling
leads to the end user. You're building
the directory to bring the end user to
you so that you can get a foot in the
door and then sell them other services.
So,
&gt;&gt; why wouldn't this work for somebody
who's like, you know what, I'm a digital
agency that specializes in tree trimming
businesses or I'm a digital agency that
specializes in Bitcoin miners. Great.
You create your own directory and you
use that as lead generation, not just

[22:01]
use that as lead generation, not just
for selling leads to the end user, but
to the businesses themselves. That's
your lead generation for them to come in
and then start using your services. What
do you think? I love it because if I had
to choose between a directory of end
consumers that got 10,000 hits a month
versus a directory of business owners
that got 1,000 hits per month, I'd much
rather have the latter
&gt;&gt; because most directories monetized by
just banner ads, which is like the
lowest form of monetization. You don't
need to do any work. It's it can be
somewhat passive, but it's so you just
don't get much from it. You really need
a ton of traffic. And so the play with
directories,
&gt;&gt; you need volume. It's kind of like
Subway. You want to make money in
subway, you got to own 50 subways.
Because if you own one, you're going to
make like 20 grand a year, right? You
want to make money in directories,
probably got to own like 10 directories.
And you know, it's going to be 8020.
Most of them won't do much. Two or three
of them will do really well, right? It's
a vertically integrated directory to a
high ticket monthly recurring offer,
right?
&gt;&gt; Totally.
&gt;&gt; To the right audience that can afford
it.
&gt;&gt; It's going to take a minute to get spun

[23:01]
&gt;&gt; It's going to take a minute to get spun
up and to gain traction and all that
stuff, but I think that those customers
are going to be really high intent.
They're going to be really sticky
customers and it's just going to be
after you, it's almost like programmatic
SEO. After you build it out, it's just
going to be generating leads for you
forever.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. What are some other ideas we could
launch this in? Like a B2B not Yeah. a
B2B directory.
&gt;&gt; So, thank you for asking that cuz I
should have said that. I would look at
high ticket services or businesses that
have like high LTV. I like the healthare
space because like they're not typically
targeted by these types of ideas. So I
think you could go to any other vertical
within the healthcare space. I think
home services are kind of overly
saturated. So where I would look like
today 2025, I would look at the other
small businesses like hometown
businesses, restaurants, CPAs, lawyers,
businesses that are high ticket, high
trust, and aren't yet overly saturated
by a bunch of people like you and I who

[24:00]
by a bunch of people like you and I who
are like, "Oh, home services. Anybody
can start a home services business."
Well, it's like not anybody can start a
CPA business. Not anybody can start a
law business. Not anybody wants to start
a restaurant. So, that's kind of where I
would go is just start building out
these directories without necessarily
knowing the monetization play for it
&gt;&gt; and then either finding a digital agency
that I can partner with or just selling
it at some point. That's where I would
go.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I love it. I mean, we have our
directory animal afterare, but it's like
I wish we were getting leads from
cremation clinics and veterinarians,
&gt;&gt; but we're we're not. We're getting leads
from poor Nancy that just had her dog
die.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, that's a good one.
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
&gt;&gt; All right. I want you to pull up the
flowerletters.com.
&gt;&gt; The flowerletters.
&gt;&gt; Yep. I am so hyped on this idea.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; And someone needs to copy this. Can I
tell you what this business is?
&gt;&gt; Can I share my screen so people can see
it?
&gt;&gt; I can. Sure. Nick, what do women love
more than romance novels? I'll answer

[25:01]
more than romance novels? I'll answer
that for
&gt;&gt; money. World War II history. Okay.
fictional World War. I swear every time
I see my wife reading a book, it's about
some terrible thing that happened during
World War II. I don't know what it is,
okay? Like flies to honey. Okay, this
business, this website, the
flowerletters.com,
they send two letters, like handwritten
in quotations, not actually, but
appearing handwritten. Two letters per
month to people paying $10 per month
that tell a story. They're like reading
love letters between two people during
World War II. And it has like stickers.
It has like some artwork in there. It's
really well done, really tastefully
done.
&gt;&gt; $10 a month, two letters per month. They
have like six different themes or genres
or story lines that you can follow. The
churn is very low because it's like a
book. They're like getting a book by
letters. You don't want to cancel on
month three because you don't know how
it ends in month 12.

[26:01]
it ends in month 12.
and I know all the details of this
business because I found a random blog
article on USPS's blog of all things
because they're a massive customer of
USPS. What are your what are your
immediate thoughts before I go further?
&gt;&gt; My immediate thoughts honestly I love
the idea these guys are Mormons and I
went to the website to go look at it and
of course the Clarks live in Utah, USA
and have been married
&gt;&gt; hometown of Brandon our friend
&gt;&gt; PG brother I love it. I think that
this is going to the like if you're
looking at a spectrum of things right
now, instant gratification is what
everybody goes for. Instant, instant,
instant. And this is zigging while
others are zagging. It's not instant
gratification. It's a trickle of letters
that are coming in. And I think that's a
really smart play. They're like, "Okay,
you want everything right now. We're not
going to do that. We're going to go back
and play into this niche." So, I think
that's a really interesting framework is
like looking at what is popular right
now and going the total opposite

[27:00]
now and going the total opposite
direction. And so, anyways, yeah, I love
that.
&gt;&gt; All right, so this is what their volume
is like. This was a year ago. A year
ago, they had 31,000 active subscribers.
&gt;&gt; What?
&gt;&gt; Okay, $10 a month.
&gt;&gt; 31,000.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're talking 310 grand a month.
This was a year ago and they're they've
they're only four years old. I would bet
they're closer to 400 or 500 grand a
month at this point.
&gt;&gt; What?
They're not doing paid ads. It's just
word of mouth. It's just a good product.
&gt;&gt; Okay. $310,000 a month and it's two
letters a month.
&gt;&gt; Two letters a month. And the cost of a
stamp at bulk is like less than 50. Cost
the paper printing like for sure it's
under $2 all in like for your cogs.
&gt;&gt; Let's just say it's $2 all in. It's 60
grand a month of COGS.
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; So their their gross margins $250,000
a month.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. 80% give or take. 24 employees.

[28:03]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. 80% give or take. 24 employees.
&gt;&gt; Well, dude, you know this. Like in a lot
of these businesses, you look at the
cost of goods sold and their net mar
their gross margin, you're like, "Oh,
they're freaking crushing it." And then
you look at below the line and you're
like, "Oh, that's why their gross
margins are so good is because they
spend so much money on customer
acquisition. They're on Meta. They're on
Google. They're doing paper click.
They're doing SEO, whatever. They're
doing cold outreach. And so their net
margins are are nowhere near as good
because they've got to pay so much money
to acquire customers. But you just said
they're not spending any money on
marketing.
&gt;&gt; That's what they said in this interview.
I didn't see them on the meta ads
library. So let's just say, let's just
say back of the napkin, 5 million a year
topline, $4 million a year after their
COGS come out. They still have 24
employees. Surely there are other costs,
right? 24 employees. Let's call it I
don't know. Some of them are part-time,
some of them are full-time. Let's say 75
grand a year. So, she gez,
&gt;&gt; bro. Like, I feel bad for them. Like, I
almost

[29:01]
almost
&gt;&gt; I almost don't want to release this
podcast episode cuz they're going to get
freaking destroyed. What would stop
somebody from coming in here investing
even if you invested like $100,000 in
paid ads? How many customers would you
get? You could easily target people on
Facebook in particular. You go to Meta,
you find people who are going to fit
this profile, and then you you just said
the churn is exceptionally low. You lock
them in. I'll get that 50 grand back in
what
&gt;&gt; a year, less than a year, and I'm like,
and I'm already cash flow positive in
the first few months. If they're not
doing any paid ads, like look at their
website. It's not like they don't look
overly sophisticated. I think somebody
could come in here and just blow this
business out of the water just by
spending on some paid ads. But I don't
think this would like hurt them. I think
that would grow the pie, you know? I
think this is like a a way of delivering
this type of content that is innovative,
new, and unique. Even though it's
ironically using a very old-fashioned
way of communicating, I think that if
someone were to come in and even if they
didn't do paid ads, even though they

[30:00]
didn't do paid ads, even though they
just did a different genre, same style,
same level of quality, postapocalyptic,
space opera, interstellar romance,
renaissance, Italy, like take like just
go to Amazon and take all the top
categories for women, sort
&gt;&gt; and then just pick one or five or 10,
right?
&gt;&gt; And take the same approach. This is a
really cool business. This is a really
cool business. This is one of those
businesses where they probably looked at
each other a year in and were like, "Is
this real?" Like, "Is the is the other
shoe going to drop at some point?" You
know, like, you know what I mean? Like,
"Hey, we just made a half a million
dollars
selling letters to people." I think
there's a good chance their net profit
is over 2 million a year because at 24
employees, 75 grand each, that's 1.8
million a year. Like they could be doing
two million.
&gt;&gt; I can't get to a scenario where they're
not doing less than that. They're dude,
they're using the thing. We've talked
about this. Like one of the largest
subsidies, marketing subsidies that
nobody talks about is the United States

[31:00]
nobody talks about is the United States
Postal Service. The true cost of sending
these letters is much more than you're
paying for a stamp. And that's their
main cost. Like that's their
distribution channel. So you're
effectively piggybacking off of the USPS
and the American taxpayer to get your
COG so low that you're like your net
margins are $2 million a year. That's
insane, dude. And I looked at Similar
Web of what their traffic is. They're
getting 60,000 unique visitors per
month. If you take a 3% conversion rate,
that's 1,800
per month times 10 18,000 of MR added
every month at a 3% conversion rate. Oh
my gosh.
&gt;&gt; Four years old in business.
&gt;&gt; So, they're just relying on word of
mouth and SEO.
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; How long do you think it took them to
get to the spot? Like, how long do you
think it took them to get to 31,000? Cuz
they started in 2020. We're we're in the
middle of 2025. Was it like, oh, 31
divide by 5, 6,000 a year for the for

[32:00]
divide by 5, 6,000 a year for the for
the first five years or Well, it says
they launched August 2020. Great timing.
Okay. Perfect timing. It says, "At
first, there were 38 subscribers who
followed the romance of one couple." So,
they just had like one story line to
start through letters and postcards
against the backdrop of historical
events. Today, they have 31,000
subscribers. Since 2020, more than 1.8
million letters have been mailed. They
run the business by themselves or they
used to from their home and now they
ship it from a warehouse in Orum. And
they have four other series like four
other storylines you can follow. and
they say many of their customers
subscribe to multiple at the same time.
So, we're talking 20, 30, $40, $50 a
month from some customers instead of 10.
Quick question, what if there were a
private community out there of people
that were building businesses based on
this podcast? Well, I just made it and
it's only for business starters and
business builders. It's called TK owners
and it's basically like having me and a
hundred other business geniuses as your

&gt;&gt; Dude, I have an amazing business idea to
launch off of this. Let's go.
&gt;&gt; Amazing. When I was a kid, my
grandfather was really into chess. He
was he wasn't a grandmaster, but he was
I don't even remember what the rating
system is, but he was he was highly
rated. He played chess all the time. He
loved it. He taught me how to play
chess. I'm not very good at it, but he
taught me how to play chess. And every
time I would go over to his house,
there'd be a chessboard on his table

[34:01]
there'd be a chessboard on his table
that was like in the middle of a game. I
don't remember the first time he told it
to me, but I must have at some point
been like, "Grandpa, why is that sitting
there?" And he explained to me that he
had a pen pal that he would write
letters to and they were in the middle
of a chess game. And the chess game
would last probably months because they
would send a letter and tell him, "Oh, I
moved my knight from F2 to L7 or you
know, whatever the metric is, right,
&gt;&gt; dude? So good." Oh
&gt;&gt; yeah. Yeah. That's how he would play.
And he had like a couple of friends that
he was corresponding with. Why couldn't
you bring that back with like a
technology I don't know bent to it.
&gt;&gt; Why technology?
&gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. What I'm saying is the
technology bent to me would be on the
marketing side. It wouldn't necessarily
be the way that they're experiencing the
game together. Cuz like how do you
acquire customers would be my I don't
even know how I don't know how he did it
the last time. I'm pretty sure he did it
through like there's probably some
international chess federation and so
like they have local chapters and that's

[35:00]
like they have local chapters and that's
how we met people. But that would be the
only technology component to it is like
okay how do you acquire customers and
match people up? But I'll tell you how
you find customers.
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay. Hello dude. You buy banner ads
on chess.com and on the chess.com app.
These guys have like 26 million hits a
month. It is the website. They have like
85% market share for playing chess.
&gt;&gt; Did you Wait, did you just look that up
as we were talking or did you know that?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; No, I was like,
&gt;&gt; I knew that.
&gt;&gt; Okay, Rainman.
&gt;&gt; Sorry, I take that back. They had 35
million visitors per month in June of
2020. In December 2022, they had 100
million users per month.
&gt;&gt; 3x growth between 2020 and 2022.
Wow. Holy crap. That's an interesting
framework. Going the opposite way from
digital to analog and writing trends

[36:03]
digital to analog and writing trends
that are growing exponentially. No, not
even exponentially, but just like
growing way faster than they should. So,
if chess is taking off, is there a way
to take it from the digital to the
analog? And the answer to that would be
yes. Through through something like
this, right? Like, hey, we'll assign you
to a pen pal. Now, I could bastardize it
and be like, "Oh, we'll just do it with
AI and the AI will make the move and
we'll send the letter." Like, yeah, you
could do that. But really, what you'd
want to do is actually pair them with
somebody who they're playing against.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. At their skill level.
&gt;&gt; Right. Right. At their skill level. So,
there's a little bit of a marketplace
component to it that would make it a
little bit difficult, but I think you
could solve that through like Facebook
groups,
&gt;&gt; dude. Like what you did with Texas
Snacks, right? You went and bought a
BIES Facebook group. You could go and
probably buy some chess groups, roll
them up, merge them together. All of a
sudden, you got 10,000 members. You get
a master list of everybody and their
ratings. They pay five bucks a month.
And then you're the one that sends the
correspondence between everybody, right?
Like you
&gt;&gt; you don't even ask them to send the

[37:00]
&gt;&gt; you don't even ask them to send the
correspondence. You're like, "Hey, just
make the move. You can you can submit it
here digitally and then we will
&gt;&gt; actually send the letter. You don't have
to worry about going and getting the
stamp and writing it or any of those
things."
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Interesting. I would want to test
that because I feel like there is
something magical about putting a letter
in the mailbox. There's especially
something magical about walking out to
the mailbox and getting a letter, right?
Which in your scenario, they would still
experience that. There is a lot of
friction to, you know, right? And but
maybe you order, you get a kit or
something and it's like a kit.
&gt;&gt; That's exactly what I was going to say.
Like post like pre-stamped envelopes. It
has the name and address on there and
literally all you do is they have even
have like
&gt;&gt; kind of like you know some board games
come with like a card of like things
that you fill out to keep track of the
score. who would have like a chess a
paper chess board and they like draw
arrows of their moves and they just mail
it and it's like it's just
&gt;&gt; I feel like people are going to hear
this and they're either going to think
it's the stupidest idea they they've
ever heard and I respect that but I hate

[38:02]
ever heard and I respect that but I hate
them or the most genius idea that
they've ever heard cuz it's just
complete the opposite direction.
&gt;&gt; I think there's a lot of kids growing up
who've never experienced getting a
letter in the mail. They've gotten text
messages. They've gotten emails. They've
gotten FaceTimes. They've got like But
like, dude, there is something magical
about a letter in the mail. They've
probably gotten a lot of Amazon packages
in the mail, but like a letter in the
mail that's addressed to them there. So,
&gt;&gt; yeah,
&gt;&gt; chess is one thing, but like bringing
back pen pals somehow with kids, I think
that would be a really interesting
thing.
&gt;&gt; Well, dude, what about like the flower
letters, but for kids? Like a kids book
sent to kids. And you could do one of
two ideas. You could do it one way. Like
the flower letters is one day you're
reading stories about other people.
Awesome. It could be a two-way
conversation where the the kid receives
a letter with a pre-stamped prepaid
envelope and like a blank page and they
could write back and like customize what
happens in the story like a choose your
own adventure kids book.
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's such a good idea. Do you
remember when we were kids grew up LDS?

[39:00]
remember when we were kids grew up LDS?
The friend. Do you remember the friend?
&gt;&gt; Of course.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, like we had this magazine in
the church. It was the friend. It was
for kids and there was a section in the
friend that you always turn to. Do you
remember?
&gt;&gt; Nope.
&gt;&gt; It was the stories at the end that the
kids told. So kids could write in and
then every every month with the friend
issue there would be like a story from a
kid and it was like this is Eduardo in
Ecuador or this is Hans in Germany and
they would like oh yeah yeah that was
the best part. They do the same thing in
the Leona like just personal stories
from people.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But like I don't get the weon
anymore. Or at least I don't I don't
read through it with my kids anymore
just because we have like we could go to
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you're a bad dad.
&gt;&gt; Thumbf follow me.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm a bad dad. I don't believe in
that stuff anymore.
&gt;&gt; No, but we could we can go to like
Living Day Scriptures or Thumb Follow Me
or like the YouTube channels and we can
watch that stuff. But like something
with like that component of kids sharing
stories and having a way to connect with
other kids, I think that would be so
cool to see like they took the time to
write it. They have like a message that

[40:00]
write it. They have like a message that
they're sending between one another.
That that would be a really interesting
even the like it could be the letters
that they're My son loves to read and
he's just giving the letters in a
series. Oh, dude,
that would be so cool. You could just
take a book, license the book. This
might be more expensive. You take the
book, you license the book, and then you
just send them chapters.
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; You know, one month at a time, and it's
like, oh, they finished early. Well,
they got to wait for the next chapter.
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; that could be really cool.
&gt;&gt; I like the idea of making an interactive
kid story through letters using AI on
the back end, but like the delivery is
very old school. And so, a kid gets a
letter like a kid gets a letter with a
story about a boy and his dog, right?
And then the boy has some prompts,
right? Where he can change the the
outcome of the story and he he's given
ideas of how to change it, right? But
it's really up to him. The letter gets
sent back. It gets put into a machine,
gets opened automatically, scanned
automatically, uploaded to Chad GPT

[41:01]
automatically, uploaded to Chad GPT
automatically. Chad GBT knows the
assignment, knows what it writes back
based on where the boy or the girl is
taking the story. And then, you know, it
uses a handwritten font. It makes it
look personalized. It spits out a
response. It nails it back to him. So,
the kid literally feels like someone is
helping him write this story, but it's
really AI, but it doesn't feel like AI.
And then at the end of it, you get the
freaking thing printed into a book.
That's the upsell at the end,
&gt;&gt; dude. Dude, okay, I have you one better.
So, remember last year we were talking
about capturing stories in assisted
living facilities. We've created an app
and we are going to roll it out. It's
called One Life Tale. One of the
components to it though that my
brother-in-law created was if you as a
family member want to gift somebody
something. So, let's say, hey, you know
what? Carson, and Carson's probably too
old for this at this point, but Carson's
nine or 10. and he's learning to read. I
want to get Carson a gift for his
birthday. I can go and enter information
about Carson into this app and it will
generate a story for Carson. And then I

[42:00]
generate a story for Carson. And then I
can go to Barnes & Noble and I can get
it printed out and it will have like
pictures and it will be a story and
Carson is the is the protagonist and
he's reading about himself and I send it
to him and it's like,
&gt;&gt; "Oh, that's a really cool, thoughtful
gift." In the same way you're saying the
kid is helping write the story. It's
like, "Yeah, I want to I want to make
sure I'm connected with my niece or my
nephew or my cousins or whoever." Every
month it sends me a prompt and it's like
when was the first time you met Carson?
What's your favorite thing about Carson?
What does he like to do? What have you
and Carson like to do? And then it's
sending them this like story that AI
generated obviously,
&gt;&gt; but within the story Carson's reading
like, wait, how did it know that I love
Skittles? How did it know that Nick and
I actually went to the Rangers baseball
game?
&gt;&gt; You know what I mean? It's like weaving
them into the story. I think that would
be a really cool way to then bring
families together who are distant to
feel like, "Oh, yeah, we're close. I
created that story with Carson."
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's good. That's a really cool
idea.
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's so good. Cuz, you know, it's
so easy to think, well, AI can just do

[43:00]
so easy to think, well, AI can just do
everything. AI is just going to do
everything because it knows everything
because it's all on the internet,
&gt;&gt; right?
&gt;&gt; Most of everything is not on the
internet, believe it or not. Like the
internet doesn't know that the Bear Lake
Boat rentals place has more pontoon boat
rentals than skiboat rentals. Like the
owner knows, the employee knows, but
that's not on the internet. That's not

&gt;&gt; So there's so much more institutional
knowledge and one-on-one experiences
that have never been recorded and will
never been recorded, but that's like the
most valuable stuff. like I use this
Limitless pendant. I could not like I
would love to prompt it and say, "Write
write an autobiography based on
everything that's happened since the day
I put this pendant on." And it could,
but it would be very it would be like
reading a research report. It would be
very vanilla because it doesn't know
like what's in my heart, what's in my
mind. It doesn't know my insecurities.
Like it only knows things that I
vocalize, which it's kind of like, "Hey
babe, what's for dinner tonight?" You

[44:01]
babe, what's for dinner tonight?" You
know, like that's not very tight. Or
like talking about business ideas. Like
that's not the most important stuff. So
what you're describing is merging those
two worlds, right? Like AI doesn't know
that Carson and his cousin's first
interaction was over, you know, throwing
Skittles into the pond. AI doesn't know
that, but this that book could know that
because of the the human element that
you're adding to the story, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's pulling out those pieces from
you and your experience by asking you
the right questions so that it can then
create a story that allows you to be
connected. I'm with you. Like I think at
first like we went through the waves of
AI and you're like, "Oh my gosh, AI is
going to replace everything. Oh, this is
going to change and it is going to
change the world." But the more and more
I'm learning about AI, I'm like, you
know what? Yes, it's going to change
everything, but it's just going to it's
just going to change our lives. It's not
going to eliminate
like there's not going to be mass
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; layoffs and we're just not going to be
we're not going to do anything that
anymore. we're still going to have

[45:01]
anymore. we're still going to have
things that we need to work on and AI is
not going to be able to pull out the
things that we know are intrinsically
valuable to us. So to me, that's a cool
framework.
&gt;&gt; I think a lot of people are justified in
feeling scared that the human experience
is going to turn into like a Wall-E
experience just sitting in a bubble and
robots and computers do all these things
to us. But I don't think that's going to
happen for the same reason that when
ebooks were invented, physical books
didn't go away. Physical books are
thriving. They're doing better than
ever. You just cannot replace in-person
physical touch, feel, all those senses
that are activated with an in-person
experience. You can't fully replace
that. It will always be superior like an
artificially generated experience or
story or novel or whatever, right? So,
video is cool, but you know what's
better? Long form audio via podcast and

&gt;&gt; I had a conversation with my
brother-in-law this week. He's in the
film industry. He's an editor. He's
super creative. And I'm like, "Oh, are
you using AI?" And he's like, "Oh,
absolutely not." Like, he just he hates
AI. And the more we talked about it, it
was be
well, you know, I totally see it from
his perspective. It's like that's
eliminating jobs in the entertainment
space the nicest way possible from like
a scarcity mindset. It's like, "Oh, AI
is coming for me and I'm going to get
eliminated." I was like I was trying to
help him see and understand like well
here's the thing like all the research
that you do in order to write a script
when you're planning the shoot and you
need to know the location and the
weather that's coming up and which shot
might work like you're effectively just
hiring an analyst. Why wouldn't you use
it to do that? And now it's going to be
so much cheaper to produce content and
good content because good content is
going to stand out more than bad
content. You don't need a whole
production company behind you. You don't
need a whole studio behind you. can go
and create a show that used to cost $10
million for $10,000. It's going to take

[47:00]
million for $10,000. It's going to take
a while, I think, for him to kind of get
there. But I actually think that's
what's going to happen with AI is
there's going to be an unlock of the
large institutions aren't necessarily
going to have the monopoly on things
that they used to. Individuals now are
going to have the power and ability to
create things that they otherwise hadn't
been able to up until this point. It's
going to give them a lot more freedom.
So, to your point, it's like, yeah,
we're not going to have the Wall-E
experience because we don't want the
Wall-E experience.
&gt;&gt; No, we don't. And some people think they
do, but but they don't.
&gt;&gt; No, they don't. I sold my companies,
you've sold businesses, and like for the
first week, it's like, oh, cool. I don't
have to work. And then you're like, I
got to do something. I got to, you know,
I got to go figure something out. Like
you you that's just the way we're wired.
We like to work.
&gt;&gt; The pie just grows, right? It's like the
same principle. I was listening to this
other podcast. They were talking about
Shopify. One of the big VCs passed on
investing in Shopify because they
crunched their numbers and they looked
at the total e-commerce market and they
thought, man, pie in the sky scenario.

[48:01]
thought, man, pie in the sky scenario.
If Shopify ever gets 20% of the
e-commerce market, it's only a billion
dollar business and we want a hundred
billion dollar business. So, pass. What
they didn't foresee is that the
e-commerce market would 20x in size and
Shopify only has like 3% of it instead
of 20%, but they're a hundred billion
dollar business because the pie grew
that much. So, I think that's what AI is
going to do is grow the pie. I think,
you know, 10 years ago it was
unfathomable to have a trillion dollar
company. Now, we have a handful of them,
right? Right now, it's unfathomable to
have a 10 or hundred trillion dollar
company. But as the pie continues to
grow, there's going to be a lot more of
them, right? Because we're we can't
think about the future as the present
looks today. It's going to look much
different with a much bigger pie.
&gt;&gt; I literally just heard a podcast talking
about this. Are you familiar with like
Meta Meta's project Orion?
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; So you you've seen the Meta like
&gt;&gt; Is that like I I think so. Anyway, keep
going.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. You've seen the Meta Ray-B band
glasses.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Augmented reality, right? So Orion's
basically it's augmented reality. It was

[49:02]
basically it's augmented reality. It was
the acquired podcast actually and they
had seen sort of a preview of it and
they were like once I saw that I knew
that is the future. Okay. But they were
doing some analysis and they're like the
amount of money that Meta has spent and
is continuing to spend investing in the
Orion project, even if they had the
adoption that the iPhone had starting in
2008 through today, they wouldn't be
cash flow positive until 2045. So it's
like an 18-year investment, right?
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; And these are glasses that have
augmented reality. And not only
augmented reality, but you don't need
AirPods. They actually feed the audio
through the frame of the glasses and you
can listen to things. Things pop up on
the screen. You can have text
conversations. It it kind of rethinks
the way that we interface with
technology. And and their point was like
this is going to change the way that we
interface with technology. But if Meta
is right, which I mean Mark's done a
freaking phenomenal job of being right,
then it's not going to be the iPhone
market. It's going to be a totally
different category that's going to be

[50:01]
different category that's going to be
whatever $2 trillion. And you know,
they're going to pay back much sooner
than that. But it's it's our inability
to understand compound growth and
exponential growth that sometimes holds
us back from understanding the
opportunity that's in front of us.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's not going to be the iPhone
market. It's going to be the market of
people that have eyes, right? Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Like AI AI is AI is not disrupting
technology. It's disrupting human labor,
which is the biggest market in the
world. Every job that everyone does,
it's going to take a slice of that. So,
you just have to think about it
differently.
&gt;&gt; Built different.
&gt;&gt; All right, we'll call this the
vibe code idea of the week. Someone
should use rapid or whatever to go vibe
code one or both of these ideas. I have
two of them. I can't just do one. You
ready?
&gt;&gt; I'm ready, dude. I'm Yes. You've got the
not.com. You've got zola.com. Massive
wedding marketplaces, right? If I own a
wedding venue or if I'm a wedding
photographer, I got to list my services
there. Agreed.

[51:00]
there. Agreed.
&gt;&gt; Agreed. I think someone needs to vibe
code a marketplace or a directory for
random off-the-wall niche wedding
services. For instance, and I've posted
content about a lot of these, there is a
donkey in Arizona that they call the
beer burrow, right? And people having a
wedding, they rent out this donkey for
$700 for a day. They put beers on the
donkey's back because donkeys are meant
to hold hundreds of pounds. and the
donkey just walks around the wedding and
people grab beers off its back and it's
a gimmick but it's extremely profitable
because it's extremely Instagrammable
and it goes viral all the time. Okay? Or
you've got shakuderie carts, right? Or
you've got like those 360 degree photo
booths or you've got like a vintage
camper photo booth or like fake tattoo
bars or like they have authentic Italian
pizza trucks that only cater to
weddings. all these random one-off
things that people increasingly want

[52:00]
things that people increasingly want
more and more because they want their
wedding to be unique, Instagrammable.
They don't want it to be like all their
friends weddings. It needs to be
different. It needs to have a beer
burrow. I think there needs to be a Zola
or the not.com for all of these random
things that is just the go-to for like
the longtail wedding niches and
services. What do you think?
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, what are you building? you're
building the website or you're building
the like back-end platform that is
facilitating the transactions between
them because the knot.com you're you're
going through the knot, right? Like
they're not just you're not going there
and saying like, "Oh, Joe Bob Smith does
XYZ for weddings. I'm going to go
contact Joe Bob Smith." You know what I
mean?
&gt;&gt; So, I feel like it would start as a
directory and it would morph into a
marketplace, right? We all know
marketplaces are hard. So, we're going
to start it as a directory. We're just
going to scrape, very simply, we're
going to scrape all of these random
one-off services. We're going to use
Replet to put it in a database and
display it in an attractive way
&gt;&gt; and then you can sort, you can filter,
and anyone that's about to get married

[53:00]
and anyone that's about to get married
can go to this website and look at all
these cool and it's free marketing.
You're sending free leads to these
people, right? And then over time, as
you build traction and as you build a
name for yourself, then you reach out to
the people that are getting leads and
you're like, "Hey, you're getting leads
from my website. I'm going to charge you
now or I'm going to take you off the
website. That's the business.
&gt;&gt; Wow, that's really cool. This is how I
think you would do it. You would start
in a market. Let's say you're in Dallas.
You do things that don't scale. So, you
find your list of 50 people or companies
that are offthe-wall. What do you call
it? The b the beer burrow.
&gt;&gt; Beer burrow. You got a puppy cuddle
corner. You got a white wedding bounce
castle.
&gt;&gt; Dude, that's amazing. Okay. So, that
you're like you're in Dallas and you
individually reach out to these people
and you're like, "This is what I'm
doing.
can I put you on my directory? And they
would say yes. So, you test it first and
just see how you would set up this
directory because in order for it to get
traction, like you've got to get you've
got to build SEO to it. Like, you can't
just throw it up and have it necessarily

[54:00]
just throw it up and have it necessarily
work. But going back to the directories
ideas that we had before, you're using
it as a lead funnel for these businesses
to use you for essentially marketing
services. Once you build in Dallas, then
you would I would go to other markets to
to actually test it. But I would start
small. I would go in one market, do
something that doesn't scale, see how it
works, and then scale it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like starting in one local
market. I don't think you need to ask
permission, though. You just throw them
up on the website with their contact
info and everything. It's
permissionless. And then you could even
use paid ads. You'd have to come out of
pocket, but you could use paid ads to
women that are about to get married to
push traffic to it. like you're doing
free marketing for all of these people
that you're listing, but then you're
coming back and charging for them.
Premium placement, banner ads, whatever.
&gt;&gt; I guess I was saying like do it, but I
would still reach out to them to do
that. What you're saying is like, hey, I
already got you here. Are you willing to
spend
&gt;&gt; give me $100 this month so I can run
&gt;&gt; ad?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; It's, hey, I listed you. You're welcome.
&gt;&gt; Yep. Yep. I listed you. This is the
idea. I'm not just a like random person

[55:00]
idea. I'm not just a like random person
who's like, I have this idea that I'm
going to execute. Like, no, you show
them you're a serious person
&gt;&gt; and then you go to them and you're like,
if you pay me $250 this month, I'm going
to go run paid ads and we're going to
see kind of what comes from this.
&gt;&gt; I love this idea because a year ago it
wasn't approachable to 98% of people
listening to this because this is a
pretty heavy website. There's kind of a
lot going on here, but I know for a fact
because I've built other directory
websites that you could build this with
AI. You could vibe code it with natural
language. The next vibe code idea I have
is I really like the idea of white
labeling a vibe coding service like
lovable or replet. I think lovable is
starting to offer uh whitelabeling. And
so here's the idea. Here's the whole
idea. A vibe coding app that's just
white labelled lovable replet whatever
because we don't know how to build a
vibe coding app. That's way above our
heads. But it's for a certain niche,
right? So call it lovable for video game
designing. And it does everything that
all these apps can already do. It's not
special. It's just a rapper. Instead of
a Chad GBT rapper, it's a vibe coding

[56:00]
a Chad GBT rapper, it's a vibe coding
rapper. And I want to make a video game.
Kids want to make them, adults want to
make them. It could be simple like
Pac-Man. It could be more complex. But
how cool would it be to play a game that
you built?
&gt;&gt; Dude, I was just talking to my
brother-in-law about this this week.
Like they love fantasy novels and
they've always been like, I want to
write a fantasy book. And in order to do
that, you had to get like concept art
and you had to write the thing. and and
now with like Midjourney and ChatPC, you
could write your own fantasy novel and
have it actually turn out the way that
you're hoping that it would turn out. I
would add one thing to it. I think
there's like a premium or just like a
really cheap model, which is what you
just said, like I'll help you vibe code
it through a rapper. Cool. And I don't
know exactly how you'd build it, but you
there's probably like specific things
you need to have in the game. And so
you'd build that into the prompt and
&gt;&gt; the rapper would make sure it's like,
&gt;&gt; "Oh, hey, have you thought about your
security architecture or or oh, you
didn't actually talk about all the
attributes of your character. Make sure
you do X, Y, and Z." Right? So, there's

[57:00]
you do X, Y, and Z." Right? So, there's
a way to build that out. But then I
would have an upsell because it's really
easy to build the first 80% or 90%. It's
that last 10 or 20% that you can vibe
code to, and it's like, well, I don't I
don't know how to have this integrate
with Superbase. I don't I don't know
exactly how to create a Stripe payment
that integrates with this. And so that
upcharge would then hook you up with
somebody who is a technical person.
They're an engineer and they can get you
the last 10 to 20%.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that makes sense.
&gt;&gt; That's a great idea.
&gt;&gt; I love it. That's all she wrote.
&gt;&gt; Remember we were talking about the game
that I play with my kids
&gt;&gt; that I created? I had somebody email me
and was like, "Hey, I spent a couple
hours on this. Loved what you guys were
talking about. I created the game." So
he like he went on lovable or was it
Replet? One of those two. And just vibe
coded it. He vibecoded it and sent it to
me as like a thank you. He's and he's
been playing with his kids and updating
it frequently. Yeah, it's freaking cool.
&gt;&gt; Have you Have you used it yet?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's not exactly the way that I
played the game. Like the trivia

[58:00]
played the game. Like the trivia
categories are a lot broader. I was just
doing geography and Minecraft, but the
categories he has are are like really
broad. But yeah, I've used it and it
like it works. It's cool. I think it's
really cool. That's awesome.
&gt;&gt; All right, what' you think?
