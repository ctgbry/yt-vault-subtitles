[00:00]
welcome to the corner office we had an
idea episode today I had my good friend
on the Pod Steven Om man we are
officemates and friends and he also owns
a holding company and he's a startup
addict like I am so we get along great
we talked a bunch of business ideas we
kept coming back to White labeling
software ideas or plugins or app ideas
that would be really affordable to
Outsource the development of to a VA
overseas we talked about using call
tracking software to help Home Service
businesses with their customer service
and sales we talked about how there's a
30 % payout if you report tax fraud to
the government and how you can get paid
30% of all the tax money they recover
from the person you tattletail on it's a
good episode you're going to like it
enjoy all right who the heck is stepen
al man I am a husband and father from
beautiful Dallas Texas I have had a odd
twist and turns in my business life I
run a few businesses with friends

[01:00]
run a few businesses with friends
and make opportunistic investments when
I can and I office with some friends
including you but you're not here today
I'm not no which I'm crying you just
can't see it's on the inside I know my
studio is at home what can I say I know
I gotta influence from home yes it's not
an influence her it's an influence him
thank you it's a new yeah thank you
right what's like the high level
overview of your career from high school
to today yeah High School in Dallas went
to Texas A&M one of the crazies we bleed
maroon nuts camped out for football
tickets most people do all night long
sort of thing yeah loved it went to KPMG
and their Consulting practice so I was
not smart enough to do like tax audit
things but I was on their Consulting
side for a couple years realized that
was not really my giftedness or what I
enjoyed the most

[02:00]
enjoyed the most
I don't even know what a 22-year-old
Management Consultant is or does don't
me started don't me start I did that and
they build a very healthy rate for me
gave you about 20% of that yeah sorry
large Telecom company based in Dallas
that's headquartered here that everyone
knows who I'm talking about rhymes with
shme and T yeah I I probably did not
deliver enough value but I tried okay
then I bounced to a software company and
the your living space loved it head of
sales had never sold anything couple
guys had actually bought a business that
I wasn't really familiar I couldn't even
spell m&a when I got there and they were
very kind they taught me a lot they let
me into a lot they let me into more than
they should have probably but I kept a
lot to myself and did pretty well and
then they sold to a private healthcare
conglomerate three years into me being
there I stayed for most of their earnout
and it was super educational for me and
then I left about seven years ago

[03:01]
then I left about seven years ago
started a marketing company with a
friend and over the course of the last
six and a half seven years have started
and acquired a few different businesses
Never by myself always with friends I
think I just learned that I have more
fun and it's likely to be more
successful when I partner with other
people who are smarter than me so that
like a core framework of yours 100% yeah
you're kind of a mega extrovert right
how do you describe yourself like 73 out
of 10 extrovert okay I actually got that
from Red Zeller he said that one time
and I was like I feel between that and
our other friend Kyle who said he was a
professional opportunist was like you
know what both of those things I I
connect with yeah yeah people shy away
from the word opportunist and I'm like
no that's what I am yeah it doesn't have
to be negative yeah so okay so you only
do stuff with friends do you ever like
you haven't it you just maybe want to

[04:00]
you haven't it you just maybe want to
scratch one day and try something by
yourself see how it goes or is that not
even on your radar I'm a really big fan
of the MoneyWise podcast that Sam par
has been doing and he had a guy on a
couple weeks ago who after a successful
exit shifted over to Executive coaching
and I've always been a natural coach
Mentor like I started coaching youth
basketball when I was 15 I just really
enjoy mentorship and coaching and so I
could see myself doing something like
that solo but not like a legitimate
operating company no interest
interesting I I just literally would not
have as much fun and I'm like oh we're
all going to die it's all going to burn
like let's really enjoy our time we have
and so for me that looks like working
alongside other people really closely
yeah interesting yeah it's funny because
I coached wrestling for three years and
I didn't like it I didn't like it I
don't know I don't know what it is and
today coach like a couple business

[05:01]
today coach like a couple business
owners but it's not like my favorite and
so I always charge more than I feel
comfortable charging because it's not my
favorite but it's rewarding I get some
value out of it but it's not what I want
to be spending most of my time doing
yeah I don't think I would do that
anytime soon I also think that at
35 uh do I have some value to give to
certain people especially maybe in their
20s yes I think so a lot but what I'm
envisioning I'm thinking more like plus
kind of in that stage of my life ideally
I'd be slowing down some and that would
be a really fun way to spend my time
okay so you went to work for this
software company and it was more of a
startup Vibe they pulled you in they
like you they showed you a lot of cool
stuff kind of open your world to
entrepreneurship is that accurate 100% I
mean and really specifically business
buying using leverage to acquire
businesses they had leveraged kind of a
diverse Capital stack including a seller
notes so like just things like I didn't

[06:01]
notes so like just things like I didn't
even know people would do that I had no
idea so I'm in 24 just a sponge learning
from these guys and I'm still friends
with them both and they had a a
meaningful exit I'm really happy for
them uh they taught me a lot and and
they paid me well and they were good to
me along the way so what was the
marketing agency that you started and
how did it go in the beginning it's
called quicker we were a classic like
take anything you can get at that time
just grab it cash flow a couple
subcontractors and that was with a guy
named Sam Preston who I know you've met
it was halfhazard it was sloppy like I
had never done that before it was my
first try at it similar to the first six
to eight months of my sales career at
that software company like made a few
sales really had to work to get a little
more professional in my Approach same
thing there took about a year a year and
a half for us to really kind of figure
things out didn't really have a mentor
in that space but figured it out and we

[07:01]
in that space but figured it out and we
landed a fairly large retainer with a
large both commercial and residential
services company that randomly was based
in Wisconsin of all places and that kind
of helped us get our footing what kind
of marketing was that mainly like web
paid ads SEO kind of out stack and then
how does that differ from what you're
doing today what all are you doing today
still involved in a few businesses at a
time I had like a moniker out on the
internet that was 50 by 2050 I had this
50 businesses by 2050 oh I remember that
yeah I remember that yeah yep that was
like 2020 2019 Is 2020
2021 and that was also connected to the
idea of several Ventures I have not
always had great older mentors and I met
two older men who had been successful at
a happy hour of all places at a
conference and a mutual friend
introduced us I said hey I'd love that
we were all in Dallas and said can I buy
you lunch in the next few weeks and I

[08:02]
you lunch in the next few weeks and I
shared some things about my life and how
things were going mainly on the business
side and they both gave me the exact
same feedback and they didn't talk about
it it was nearly word for word for btim
and that led me to a place to simplify
my life a little bit more I've got three
young kids I care about my marriage and
I still enjoy having a diverse set of
business interests with a little more
Focus if I wrote a check into a venture
deal not thinking about that ever really
it's very binary and I just needed to
simplify so I did that and that's been
about 18 to 24 months and I've really
felt the benefit of that and so what
that is today I'm very involved in alarm
Masters which is our security and alarm
platform which is mainly serving
businesses like commercial we're in
Texas and you bought that H correct with
a partner that I went to Texas A&M with
okay alarm Masters quicker anything else

[09:00]
okay alarm Masters quicker anything else
there's a couple other businesses kind
of more of like adviser for a Salesforce
implementation business that's in its
second full year of operation from there
like things kind of Trail off towards
advising investment that type of
mentality and so it's like where can I
be more concentrated and more focused I
still threw writing more passive checks
and maybe I could go reach that 50
number by 2050 like I guess I'm on
target for that but not through
operating
companies yeah which that's the part
that shifted of your goal it has yeah
and I think some of that's just me being
naive when I was a little bit younger
and also not accounting for three
children life being more complex yeah
okay so G to your head you have to go
the rest of your life only starting
businesses or only buying businesses
what do you do phenomenal question thank
you very torn I've done both and I've
really enjoyed both I think at this
point I would only buy businesses I

[10:01]
point I would only buy businesses I
think because of what I learned in
starting businesses there was so much to
apply forward
into businesses that are more mature and
are more sizable I got punched in the
face enough and learned enough lessons
starting and then also across different
types of skill sets different scenarios
and hardships and things like that that
now all are very applicable to a larger
more mature business that I could buy so
yeah that's where I'd go I feel like
when you buy a business there's more
leverage opportunities leverage with
regards to like levers to pull right
like marketing levers whereas when you
start something from scratch it's like
the lever doesn't have as much of an
effect because it's not it's a brand new
you know it's a brand new thing that
might not have any Revenue whereas when
you step into something that's let's say
it's netting 500 Grand a year and
they're like their competitors are all
doing Google ads and they're not doing
Google ads it's like this is an Easy
Lover and it will make a big difference
because we have all the infrastructure
in place to really support these new

[11:01]
in place to really support these new
customers so is that accurate it is
accurate and at the exact same time I
love like starting a business from
scratch there is like a
birth aspect to that okay well with that
in mind let's go the opposite direction
and let's talk about ideas because we do
talk about buying on this podcast just
not a lot I want to hear your business
ideas I'll try to give you a couple as
well all right if you are watching this
clip right now you are watch watching
this on YouTube and if you are a fan of
podcast please check out my podcast
while you're at it because sometimes I
have podcasts that aren't on YouTube and
sometimes I have YouTubes that aren't on
podcast so check out the ker office on
any podcast platform or you can go to
TKO pod.com also my newsletter will
throw that in there there are no ads
It's weekly it's different content than
my podcast and YouTube newsletter.
chrisj cerner.com You'll see the link
and we'll see you there a lot of things
that I think about when it comes to this
type of conversation are a different use
of the same technology ology or a niched

[12:00]
of the same technology ology or a niched
version of something that's typically
more
generalized those sorts of things like
interest me and I think the question is
whenever you're going to start something
what's the goal I have the standard to
try to achieve a hundred million do of
Revenue I might come up with something
different I'm not GNA apply that sort of
pressure on these ideas sure it's a good
point one that I like that I think most
people will hate so controversial we
have these listening tools Firefly and
things like this and we use them for
note taking there's different there's
been adaptations on the sales side I
think that there needs to be a a version
of that or an expression of that leans
more HR I just was talking to someone
the other day who got hit on a zoom call
and they were very
uncomfortable but the call wasn't
recorded and they knew it wasn't
recorded and they didn't have an
automatic like Note Taker in so nothing
nothing was captured I think it's
probably more interpr

[13:00]
probably more interpr
small businesses there'd be a lot of
push back a lot of complaining but at a
more Enterprise level saying hey we're
going to roll out a tool like this it's
part of compliance or things like that
where they're really spot checking for
inappropriate comments all sorts of
different use cases there but I just
think this like more HR contextualized
version of that would be a really good
idea and and maybe it's an existing tool
that needs to be pivoted or it's like
another vertical for them
but there's quite a bit of context that
would have to be done there and maybe
it's an extension to me the idea there
is more attaching to current HR
softwares it's kind of like Channel
sales is where I'd go with
that yeah like you said there's a lot of
tools that do this but I don't think
they're right for this right I think you
need to go hard on the HR angle here
what I like about this idea is it works
best if you don't know it's working and
what I mean by that is like selling dog
vitamins it's like yeah my dog there's

[14:00]
vitamins it's like yeah my dog there's
this confirmation bi us he's so happy
he's so healthy you don't know if they
work it doesn't matter with this it's
like well what if it does doesn't record
anything what if you don't catch anyone
in the ACT well it's working it's
working because people aren't saying
things because they know they're being
recorded for that purpose right so it's
like no matter what it would be like
some sort of decreased incidence but the
problem is that a lot of those incidents
are not reported we know this whether
virtual or even physical unfortunately
so you're right I really like that
metaphor so then you're really just
looking for continued mitigation and
maybe there's again thinking more
Enterprise there's Anonymous surveys
things like that since we've rolled up
this tool in the last six months have
you experienced a decrease in XYZ yeah I
also like it because the value is so
high that it offers because of the
liability that it helps prevent right
like how expensive is a lawsuit yeah and
so even if it's like a $20 tool like

[15:01]
so even if it's like a $20 tool like
that's $20 a month per user or whatever
to prevent potentially a massive lawsuit
I wonder if you could attack the
distribution strategy here by a Bottoms
Up strategy going through the women the
people that are more likely to be like
offended or affected by someone saying
something inappropriate and so some sort
of a social media strategy that would
get female employees to request this
from their superiors as opposed to like
corre doing Enterprise SAS sales which
everyone knows is is brutal I like that
so that's one I think it's practical I
think it's probably needed it's similar
to things that people already experience
today so if I already know that Firefly
is paying attention like I think the
criticism or like if I wanted to rag on
the idea this already happens with note-
taking tools people know that it's being
recorded or there's recorded calls but
there's nothing being flagged there's no
mechanism that is pulling something out
of that and then proactively notifying

[16:01]
of that and then proactively notifying
someone so I think that's a little
different and yeah you're probably right
Bottoms Up probably would end up be more
successful and I think that it's more of
an Enterprise is there like some sort of
a a software that you could wh label to
just tap into this right because
building this from scratch would be hard
but there's got to be some sort of a
like even like an AI powered something
that you could white label for this do
you know of anything I don't off the top
of my head I wouldn't be surprised if
there is some sort of like transcription
API that you could start there and then
layer in the HR more HR oriented
components you're GNA have to build like
NLP natural language processing and you
some sort of like database that you're
pulling against to highlight those
potential issues and flag them so like
there is a proprietary element that
you're going to have to develop but it's
probably something that you could start
from to speed it up yeah I bet you could
prove the concept before having to do
all that at least white label something

[17:02]
all that at least white label something
I've got an idea that's very similar to
that that I've had for a while and this
kind of plays on the framework that
there's way like there's a huge
asymmetric Supply demand imbalance on
Zoom for their app store right like Zoom
has like a 100 million users and like
2,000 apps whereas the iPhone has like a
billion users and three million apps
like it's way way skewed now of course
you can make the argument that like apps
are just not as needful on Zoom which is
fine but I still think there's a big
supply and demand imbalance there's a
lot of tools that could be used on Zoom
so this could be one of them what you
just said I think there also needs to be
a very simple affordable sales tool call
it a Zoom app or Chrome extension that
listens on sales calls to specifically
to see who is talking the most and it's
like I'm picturing like it's a popup on
the screen that's like a meter right and
it moves according to to who's talking
because it is well proven that if you

[18:02]
because it is well proven that if you
want to sell more products or Services
you need to listen more and talk less
right and so it's it does two things in
one first of all it helps the
salesperson as they're talking like all
right I need to give this guy a break
all right I need to let this guy talk
and it reports it to the sales manager
so he can see is there a correlation
between my best performing salesman and
how little they're talking or maybe it's
inversely correlated and I think you
should call it something bombastic like
shut up or like stop talking or like
shut up. or something like it would just
quiet Point like something yes something
I love it yeah what do you think I
really like it as a former salesperson
day in day out demo demo demo demo I'm
not sure that the average salesperson
would admit to themselves that they need
it but I do think that it would be super
productive like a great tool I could see
sales managers who know that the truth

[19:02]
sales managers who know that the truth
is that their underlying teams really
could use that and then kind of a top
down from the sales manager it's
distributed you know throughout the team
so it becomes a requirement like that
sort of way I'm not sure like we talked
about previously Bottoms Up I don't know
if that would work here Loom was a great
example of bottoms up where they
trickled up into organizations
phenomenally I love them I don't think
that would happen here so I think that
you'd be going outbound cold ads all
kind of at sales managers live to life
long enough to know that really would be
a great
mechanism real time in a call I think
there'd be a lot of self-awareness
happening right like it's like oh I
don't struggle with that it's like dude
you speak 78% of the time like it needs
to be
24% yeah I think people would be very
surprised I think think one sales
strategy is to install it for free for a

[20:01]
strategy is to install it for free for a
month through the sales manager and just
monitor it and see like is this helping
because if it doesn't work they're not
going to they're going to churn out
anyway yeah I like that I wonder even if
based on average sales cycle like if it
would have to live throughout a sales
cycle and in an Ideal World you as you
know most sales especially if you're bid
market and above have many touches and
you also have to think about how does
that work on a phone call versus yep you
know a video meeting and can you
aggregate that's actually I know we're
getting in the weeds but you almost want
to aggregate those different touch
points in total attach that average to a
deal as like a deal note and say for the
lifetime of this interaction close this
deal huge win you talked 43% of the time
yeah in aggregate like that actually I
think would be even more insightful yeah
I just I love the framework that like

[21:00]
I just I love the framework that like
something that seems on the surface like
just a feature with which is what both
of us are talking about can actually be
a big company there's one app that I
used I don't remember the name of it but
it's the only company doing this and
someone needs to compete with them and
it just shows me the owner of a business
how long it's taking my employees to
reply to emails and it's the same
principle the quicker you reply the more
efficient productive you are the the
more sales you get like it's just it's
common knowledge it's common sense but
it's human nature to not respond quickly
so if I can look at my 72 employees and
see that these guys are responding to
emails and you set filters for weekends
and business hours and all that but I
just feel like a lot of the problems in
any organization whether it be five
employees or 5,000 can be solved by
better communication what is that called
by the way I don't use it I think it was
time like time to reply or something
like I had one of those names where was
it tells you exactly what it is and it

[22:01]
it tells you exactly what it is and it
started out as just like a Chrome
extension and now they're like you go
look at their team page like it's a
pretty big business and that's all they
do interesting I like it I have
something to go Google later there you
go there you go search out okay well
that's a good one that's a good one and
I feel like a lot of these kind of techy
software businesses sound unapproachable
to a lot of people if they don't know
how to code but you go to upwork you
post what you're thinking you get
someone to build something something and
then you just start from there it
doesn't have to be expensive yeah I
agree and like for people that are
interested in that you know type of
route an even more premium version of
that would be like a top tow if you're
looking to try to find someone higher
end potentially if you have a certain
need that's another place you could go
I'd also love to hear if you have any
agency ideas as well that just kind of
came to me because agency owners are
always like saying no to different
service lines right so like I'm
curious after that idea whatever you

[23:01]
curious after that idea whatever you
want what are you saying no to to stay
focused but that are good opportunities
that other people could say yes to a few
different ideas I may come back on the
agency piece yeah there's already a
market for this so this is I would say
maybe a category and we can explore a
couple ideas and I'm sure you're quickly
going to have a couple and you might
have seen this kind of Bounce Around
online recently one one version of this
but I'm going to call them like the
tattletail industry so whether it is tax
fraud there's a new piece of like
regulation that's going Live January
27th which is going to create a lot of
pain for businesses that are lead
selling and I don't know if you know
about this but like you can no longer
like a home advisor where they spit your
lead to four companies and all four
outbound you you will now have to see
those four options choose one and in
with your consent for that one business

[24:02]
with your consent for that one business
W okay let me just make sure I
understand that I'm a homeowner I need
my windows washed I go to home advisor
or Angie's List I type in my address
today they're just selling my name
number address to 13 different companies
and I'm getting hit up there's typically
a a lower limit let's call it three or
four and it also depends on the industry
too it does okay so from a honer's
perspective what is that going to look
like on January 27th for people that
follow follow this new regulation you
will present all four options to the
homeowner the homeowner will select one
and only that one will be presented with
your information and you have opted in
to be contacted by them instead of all
four playing this speed to lead game
where they all four are trying to get at
you as soon as possible interesting so
that means your ratings probably your
gmbb your ratings on that plat form
anything like that is going to years in

[25:02]
anything like that is going to years in
business will all become more relevant
for the platforms that are going to
adhere to that change it's gonna be
harder to just pay to play oh yeah for
sure but what you have to keep in mind
is I mean you know this when we talk
about lead selling there's a there's an
underbelly of lead selling and all the
onesie tws really small really Niche
there's teenagers 16-year-olds that are
running lead selling
operations and it can be a great cash
flow sort of play right with with very
Capital efficient so I do think that
this will open up a bit of a tattletail
now like a tattletail opportunity I'm
not sure if it's more competitive like
hey Home
Advisor I'll go take down as many of
your competitors as I can that I can
help proactively uncover that they are
not following this new

[26:01]
not following this new
regulation engage me to go do that for
you there's an element that like that's
one route yeah in certain industries or
certain governing bodies it's already
been established like the 30% rule on
the tax fraud now you have to produce
really meaningful evidence for that but
what is the 30% rule you can be paid by
the IRS 30% of what is recovered oh how
did I not know that that you provide
very tangible evidence essentially
there's a lot of Standards it's not like
an email that just says like you should
go look at Chris because I know that you
commit tax fraud Chris oh
obviously so I just think that there's
an interesting world this is one
example where whether you're going to a
large player in a market and you're
doing some dirty work for them or
there's some governing body whatever it
is I'm very interested it's something
that I've started to look at more just

[27:01]
that I've started to look at more just
because I'm intrigued by these kind of
like
tattletail
opportunities interesting it I'm trying
to think of some similar businesses that
do this so I had a mentor that built a
massive Consulting business that would
spy on like he was like an agency to spy
on competitors and so they would go to
trade shows and like totally fake being
a certain company just to like talk to
people at their boo like oh what what's
this product you're developing it's
stuff like the unscalable things that
you can only learn person to person like
at a bar or at a trade show he was paid
to go like do corporate Espionage how
rad would that be first of all yeah wrot
book it's almost like a more Sinister
version of a secret shopper yeah exactly
so that's where my mind is going and
it's kind of built around inflection
points in regulatory environments right
whether it's this lead rule that's being
passed or something else
I'm still hung up on the tax fraud thing

[28:01]
I'm still hung up on the tax fraud thing
like are are there people that have
businesses around that like is that like
an established industry I don't think
that they're practically marketing
themselves but are there individuals who
are capitalizing on that with some level
of scale I believe so but I haven't
confirmed that so it's an interesting
opportunity right as a professional
opportunists but then you also have to
think
about whatever that standard is for
whatever buyer on the other side whether
it is the government or some large
organization whatever it may be what's
their standard to
actually get paid right typically those
are going to be very high standards so
you've got to have be be privy to very
specific types of information and you
also have to understand the consequences
if you're going to try to play that role
so careful out there lots of things
coming to mind so first of all I the
best ideas or hustles or whatever are

[29:00]
best ideas or hustles or whatever are
the ones that people refuse to talk
about right and it could be 100% legal I
just had lunch with a guy recently and
I'm gonna I'm gon to change some of
these things around to protect his
anonymity but he he has a social media
presence and he does a lot of stuff like
us and he talks about it and he
mentioned this one thing at lunch I'm
like what is that he's like oh I don't
really talk about that one but here's
what it is and it had to do with a
medical device with certain Kickbacks
and he's like a middleman between the
medical device manufacturer and like the
the healthcare Prov providers and it's a
very Niche device and he found his own
little distribution method he basically
knows how to sell these and the big
companies have no idea how to sell these
and he's just playing a middleman
capturing a margin and every sale is
like eight grand in his personal
checking account it's like it's crazy
and he's never going to talk about it
and I wouldn't either but like oh this
tax fraud thing like it just the
government has a system set up to pay
people 30% of everything they recover
because that's the hard part is you go
bring something to the government and
they're like we're not Innovative we're

[30:00]
they're like we're not Innovative we're
not efficient like get away from us but
correct they already have system it's
got to be big enough but also if it's
got to be big enough then it also is an
attractive opportunity potentially so I
mean also we just use the word
whistleblower right like that yeah that
type of but anyways I I think again the
way that I like to think are things that
already exist where could I take those
ideas or those Technologies and go place
them somewhere else
one of the things that's done inside of
our marketing company is call
listening and so we are listening to
calls to help companies understand their
own lead
quality and Lead scoring and what that
ends up also leading to sometimes is
that you can hear awful customer service
and so you said what about an
interesting agency I think you could
take that type of which is pretty common
some of the large home service marketing
agencies will do this at scale like a

[31:02]
agencies will do this at scale like a
scorpion they actually have it's all
automated it's all through like Ai and
software and transcription and blah blah
blah others are using humans regardless
you could pivot that entire concept to
be you know customer service improvement
and optimization like if you're spending
all this money on Google or SEO or
newsletter sponsorships or I don't care
what you're doing to drive leads
someone's on the other end of that phone
is anyone really evaluating the level of
quality of those calls and that customer
service a lot of times that's not going
to a
salesperson a lot of times that is going
to sweet little Lisa in the office and
Lisa's awesome and she makes a mean
apple pie but she's brutal on the phone
she sucks at her job well she's just
she's being asked to do something that's
not really her highest and best use and

[32:01]
not really her highest and best use and
so I do think that like call listening
as an example pivoted to more
operational customer service quality
type of an orientation is an interesting
agency idea yeah I wonder if you could
use a AI to just go into like a let's
say it's like a $5 million HVAC business
right they've got a budget for stuff
like this but they're still a small
business and you just you plug this
software into their phone system and you
just listen and it just sends reports to
the owner and says hey
really no one's answering the phone from
11: to 1 we're guessing there at lunch
you got 38 calls then and we know that
20% of your calls close to an $800 job
you're losing $36,000 a month because
people are going to lunch like just
something like there are so many things
in small businesses where when a third
party comes in and just looks at it
they're like what about that and it's so
obvious to them and the business owner
is so in the weeds he's like oh yeah
and huge value unlock right yeah if you

[33:01]
and huge value unlock right yeah if you
like this idea you could basically just
use call rail I mean recording calls
listen back like so that's like the
software that you're using on the back
end to do this agency we don't
explicitly use that but if you were to
go pursue this idea yes that's would be
just like a a great starting Place yeah
that's another framework that I'm
addicted to lately is just taking a tool
a website something that's maybe known
by millions but not known by your
customer base Conor gross and I talked
about construction Journal 200 bucks a
month and you buy leads from permits
that are pulled in cities and you sell
them to pool business owners or
contractors or whatever and it's like
they could go be customers of that but
they don't know about that so pay $200 a
month for unlimited leads and sell each
lead for $100 like use call rail pay
them $79 a month but you're the guy that
pushes the button that like sets it up
reports the data and like puts a human
element to it
correct man what do you charge for

[34:01]
correct man what do you charge for
something like that you're the agency
guy yeah it depends on scale so some of
the services are priced by the minute or
buckets of minutes listened and reported
on others are just they know their
economics and so it's really built off
your own labor cost if you're going to
do it yourself well you could get
aggressive with that potentially because
it's nearly all margin you're going to
be at 90 5 98 plus perc cogs I mean
gross margins excuse me so it's really
more predicated on how you want to try
to go to market I think the minutes
thing is a little confusing in my eyes
yeah and so I just want to understand on
average how many calls are you taking a
month or a week and I can do my own math
yeah and so I'm just going to say my
goal is to achieve a 70% gross margin
and So based on this math my labor cost
my software cost and blah blah blah like

[35:00]
my software cost and blah blah blah like
that's how I would do it so you just
want to like pick a gross margin goal if
you're not going to do the work yourself
and you're managing a small team or
something and then back into their scale
of operation because should inherently
like you charge let's just say you
charge $1,500 a month for this does that
make sense to charge John Wilson's
massive company in Ohio versus $1
million plumbing company here I don't
think they have the same call volume so
it it probably doesn't make sense for
your own internal economics to charge
the same thing to anybody so it's got to
be based on some sort of tier or level
of call volume yeah I mean charging by
the minute equals customers don't know
what their bills going to look like
equals friction equals lower close rate
right correct you got to work that in
your margin like you said and then if
you're losing your shirt on month three
because people are using too many
minutes and you got to change your price
right yep I'm thinking of the the midw
meme where it's like the distribution
curve it's like on one end I'm thinking

[36:01]
curve it's like on one end I'm thinking
about like Squarespace right Squarespace
comes around and people are like on one
end of the midw meme it's like oh I
guess there's no room for a web
designing agency because Squarespace
makes anyone makes it easy for anyone to
do it that's like the middle and on the
the beginning it's like let's start a
web design agency and just use
Squarespace for people and then 80% of
people are like that doesn't work CU
square space is easy anyone can do it
and then on the other end of it it's
like let's just start a web design
agency use Squarespace exactly just
charge two grand for a website that
takes us an hour and then you literally
copy and paste the template with every
customer and swap out the logo and text
do it with call rail it's doesn't have
to be that hard no no people over
complicate it and I still can't stop
think about this tax fraud business like
I just okay I'm such a snoop I'm sorry
well after you go pursue that then we
can just do another podcast and another
episode and hear how it's going dude h
yeah so I have one other thing I want to
throw out I think it'll be funny but we

[37:01]
throw out I think it'll be funny but we
can talk about a few ideas so two-sided
Marketplace is super common there's a
bajillion of them all sorts of different
Industries have two-sided
marketplaces I was having a conversation
with someone today
actually and they they are an atheist
and they have been looking for a mentor
an older Mentor who shares their world
worldview and they have had a hard hard
time finding someone and I've already
kind of thought about like Niche
mentoring we even talked about like
Executive coaching earlier but I'm not
sure that atheism is necessarily the the
best Niche for this but you can imagine
needs that people have like moms there's
millions and millions of moms there's
several different avenues for moms to
find local mentors all sorts of
different things you know just go find a
Facebook group for crying out loud but
there are other smaller verticals or

[38:01]
there are other smaller verticals or
niches or interest groups that don't
necessarily you might be able to find
people that are interested in the same
thing as you but you can't find a mentor
related to that although it is
applicable potentially and so I think
that there's opportunities if you
already have some sort of network
available to you like something you
could capitalize on I think that
pivoting some set of contacts or
influence or business dealings you have
into a niche Mentor Network that's more
highly topical like I think that could
be very interesting where you're
brokering both sides that's another idea
as well would people have to pay for the
mentor I think so yeah yeah okay it's
time think of it like a coach Li I don't
understand how life coaching is an
industry except at the same time I
really do like I understand why people
buy it I don't like that they buy we all
want a silver bullet right correct and
so in the same way people have started

[39:02]
so in the same way people have started
to accept at a greater degree like a
greater percentage of people especially
adults self- select and say I need a
coach I need a mentor weight loss weight
gain you know whatever and so I do think
there's probably lots of Niche Mentor
like two-sided Marketplace opportunities
out there yeah I wonder if you the play
here is to scrape like a bunch of
therapists right it's really it's just a
branding change and then find out like
maybe from their bios maybe you scrape
their bios into a spreadsheet and then
use AI to like attach labels to them
like Hispanic atheist Christian Jew
whatever and then you make categories on
the site and you just put them on the
site maybe even for free to start and
you're just relabeling them from
therapist to mentor and then once you
get traction because obviously
marketplaces are very hard you got to
have the buy side and the sell side at
the same time once you get traction then
it's like hey we actually need to start

[40:01]
it's like hey we actually need to start
charging you whatever to stay on our
website because you're getting customers
from it that way you can at least start
with a supply and then you can just go
worry about the demand yeah and starting
out in a segment where there's already
this understanding like you you're bring
a therapist where there's an
understanding of this relationship
you're not having to introduce the idea
of mentorship or coaching in like the
example I gave like atheism like we're
already talking about therapy just
creating better matching which I'm sure
that I've seen some kind of in the last
two years therapy kind of virtual
therapy or yeah like better help yes
exactly some of those sorts of platforms
have some type of matching or interest
relationships but maybe not to the same
degree maybe that's the play as just
like a better help for mentoring and
it's literally the exact same thing but
there's a segment of people that are too
proud or whatever to like quote need a

[41:00]
proud or whatever to like quote need a
therapist right whether that's true or
not they don't know how to ask someone
in real life right so if there's just a
platform from them to go to it's like
dat like especially originally on The
Dating platforms like
match for the people that were too shy
it allowed them to let others know they
were interested without having to have
that brutal in Real Life Exchange yeah
kind of ease into it like I wonder if
there a lot of people that desire a
mentor they just really struggle to
engage someone who could be a great
mentor so this would provide an Avenue
so it could be like an intro like intro
for mentors where charged by 15 minute
segments maybe the first five minutes
are free or whatever to see if there's
like a VI there that's a better that's a
closer to what I was thinking yeah I
like that yeah interesting yeah because
some people like they like oh no I don't
need a therapist but I really just want
someone to help me improve my life like
a mentor it's like okay let's call it a
mentor but same thing

[42:01]
mentor but same thing
yeah that's a good one I like it well I
gotta go figure out how to start a tax
fraud whistleblower business man I can't
get that out of my head oh I would love
to when I retire cre monster I know I'm
gonna be a private investigator just
because I love spying on people so much

owners that are tax frauds and catch
them and then the government will pay
