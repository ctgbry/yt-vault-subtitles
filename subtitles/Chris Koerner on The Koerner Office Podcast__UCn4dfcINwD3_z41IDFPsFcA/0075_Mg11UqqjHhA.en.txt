[00:00]
welcome to the ker office and today will
be part two of every business I've ever
started if you'd like to hear part one
of this episode go ahead to my timeline
and scroll down a couple weeks I think
it was mid to late april-ish it's called
part one of every business I've ever
started this is part two so we left off
with me telling a story about my quarter
cows business and dragging my cow quite
literally down a country road in
Northeast Texas oh uh we left off there
let's start off off with Alabama
wholesale homes that's number 23 when I
was about 23 coincidentally maybe mid
mid-20s I learned about wholesaling
homes and I never heard of that before
and if you've never heard of it
wholesaling homes basically means
getting a house or any piece of real
estate under contract and assigning that
contract to another party without ever
purchasing it usually you have to put up
earnest money and so risking that um but

[01:04]
earnest money and so risking that um but
typically you can structure these deals
where you find them off Market you put
up a th000 bucks of earnest money and
you find someone to actually buy the
property and you make a spread so you
lock up a house under contract for 100
grand you know it's worth
170 you assign it to someone for 135
there's things that I do and don't like
about this business I really don't like
how Shady it usually is I would think
most wholesalers are shady because it's
just an inherently Shady process you're
incentivized to not disclose to either
the buyers or the sellers that you're
wholesaling the property and so that
means you have to lie and make it seem
like you own the property
um I didn't like that about it and I
also didn't like all of the tips and
tricks that I had heard from these
online gurus about how to talk down a
homeowner um regarding the value of
their property I remember one guy said
he's like if you walk in a house and

[02:00]
he's like if you walk in a house and
it's beautiful and you can't find
anything wrong with it but you just
can't get her get them down to your
price you just got to mention the layout
because you can't fix the layout right
that's the layout's always my fallback
oh it's got this weird layout but he's
like no matter what always pull the
layout card and I was just like man I
don't like that that reminds me of my
twoe used car dealership stint which was
the last real job I ever had it's just
shady I didn't like it so I got two
houses under contract that I actually
picked up on like a Government auction
website so I didn't actually have to
deal with a seller I had a th000 bucks
earnest money on both of them and I lost
the earnest money on both of them that
is my experience wholesaling but I did
buy the domain named Alabama wholesale
homes and I drove some traffic to it
through SEO and it was around for years
like years and years after I ever quit
this business and it brought in a bunch
of leads from wholesalers and Real
Estate Investors and I don't even know
what I did with that business honestly I
might still own the domain name I might

[03:00]
might still own the domain name I might
not who knows idea number
24 is Texas smokes so this idea came for
me when we were selling uh these little
smokers from bies so as you know I own a
company called Texas snacks and we
resell bies products and we noticed that
these little $100 smokers were selling
really well and I thought man this could
be a standalone business this could be a
standalone website and so the whole
business was to just keep buying these
smokers from bies and but just put it on
a different shop of my site called Texas
smokes.com
and we were buying these for 100 bucks
selling them for 160 170 they they were
really wellmade as far as smokers are
concerned um and we paid uh we we drove
some paid Facebook ads to the site and
it went well we sold a handful of them
and then we just realized this is never
going to be as big as we think Texas
snacks could be or should be this is
just a distraction um because of all the

[04:00]
just a distraction um because of all the
things I've done Texas snacks has been
one of the most steady just consistently
growing businesses and I don't want to
screw that up right I've I picked so
many businesses that have been volatile
and frankly hard to run I didn't want to
screw up Texas snacks so we ended up uh
abandoning this website as well idea
number 25 was called better inbox and
this was meant to be a small SAS app or
a Chrome extension or a web app and the
idea was to provide insights into how
long it was taking me or my employees to
respond to emails there is one company
that already does this but I thought it
was pretty clunky too featur too
expensive and I just wanted to know very
simply how long are you taking to
respond to emails uh and you'd have to
set up filters because you're not going
to respond to spam um and there's some
leg work that you got to put into it to
make this work right but this was

[05:00]
make this work right but this was
something that I wanted to build for
myself uh and for my team because I had
a sales team at the time and everyone
knows that when you're in sales the time
it takes you to respond to a lead
directly correlates to your likelihood
of closing that lead so I thought why
isn't this more common why can't I just
see a report of how long it's taking me
so I could better myself or my team to
respond to emails so I bought the domain
name better inbox might have been
doco.com and I hired a VA to build this
and I got distracted yep that sound
familiar I got distracted and so I moved
on I still think it's a good idea but
it's not a big idea and so in that sense
it's not a good idea right if it's if
the opportunity cost of chasing this
idea is high then in a sense it's not a
good idea at all idea number 26 I do not
look back at this business very fondly
it was called Halo Maids I had t-shirts
printed I had Flyers printed I bought a
course or something from a guy named
Rohan Gils and he's still around he's
still doing this same thing I think at

[06:00]
still doing this same thing I think at
the time it was called launch 28 um as
in launch a business in 28 days I assume
I think he's changed the name but a lot
of people have bought this business with
success I've heard good things I've
heard it's a good course he's a good guy
and the whole idea is basically for it
to be a drop service home cleaning
business where you find the cleaners
kind of like what we're doing with fast
Tree Care you find the crew you find the
cleaners you put up the marketing site
you drive traffic to it you charge 00
for a cleaning you pay 120 bucks to your
team and you just capture that margin
what a terrible business please if
you're listening to me don't don't start
a home cleaning business please of all
the Home Service businesses you could
start this is one of the worst ones
there are so many ways to screw up is so
low ticket I know you're chasing that
recurring angle it's not going to come
okay it's just not you might get 20 to
30% recurring jobs it is a race to the
bottom on price you're managing crew

[07:00]
bottom on price you're managing crew
that are doing a terrible job I know I'm
being pretty pessimistic right now but
I'm an optimistic guy so that should
send a message to you to not start this
business okay I know it's tempting the
gurus are really good at Guru about home
cleaning and pressure washing and all
that I would much rather do pressure
washing binary outcome that's something
I like to talk about a lot pressure
washing is a binary outcome you show up
you clean the thing you leave with home
cleaning you've got different surfaces
different types of walls different rooms
you've got to show up at a defined
window we were doing it for realtors
that made it extra hard maybe that was
our mistake there's just a zillion ways
you can screw up there are ways you can
screw up in pressure washing but I think
there are far far less ways so that was
Halo mates and I started it with my
friend Ed and he's the same guy that I
started a couple of the other businesses
with great guy love him to death he just
didn't have a lot of time to contribute
to this business so we lost about one
2,000 bucks one thing that was
interesting was we hired a bunch of high
school kids we Took a ton of postcards

[08:01]
school kids we Took a ton of postcards
really attractive Flyers double-sided
and we drove to Nebraska Furniture Mart
I say we I didn't Ed drove them to
Nebraska Furniture Mart on a Saturday
which is the biggest furniture store in
the world partially owned by Warren
Buffett if not wholly owned by Warren
Buffett I tweeted about it once or twice
and we put these flyers on cars or at
least they did uh for marketing to
because the thesis was these people are
moving they're moving in they're moving
out they're going to need uh a home
cleaner and if they're moving in even
better because it could become a
recurring job I think we distributed 500
flyers it maybe brought one to two jobs
and so I love like one of my greatest
pastimes genuinely I'm no sarcasm here I
love testing marketing ideas especially
old school marketing ideas in New School
business or new school marketing ideas
an old school business like that is my
happy place I will do that until the day
I die because it is so fun 80 90% of the

[09:00]
I die because it is so fun 80 90% of the
time it doesn't work right you don't
read articles about house cleaning
companies growing with Flyers at
furniture stores for a reason because
it's not working but 10 20% of the time
it just crushes and when it does you're
not going to see me tweet about it
you're just not because it's it's a hack
it's a growth hack and I have tweeted
this before the effectiveness of a
growth hack is directly correlated to
its lifespan okay the more effective a
growth hack the shorter its lifespan
period end of story but when you find a
growth hack you got to get it while the
getting's good you got to exploit it to
the hilt because it will not stick
around for long next business we are
number 27 now doomsday in a box this was
and the word business for this I'm using
very Loosely Sam par tweeted man I just
wish I could like click a button and
just get all of my survival prep gear
like I want a prep I want to be a
prepper I want to have gear I want to
have water food storage knives you name
it but it's a lot of work and I don't
have a lot of time and so I went and

[10:01]
have a lot of time and so I went and
bought the domain named doomsday in a
box I threw up a landing page this was
in like this was within 20 30 minutes of
his tweet threw up a landing page I
commented on his tweet and I said here
it is just to see if it would drive any
signups once again this is just me
testing something and nothing happened I
got like three signups I never did
anything with it this whole business
quote business last than 30 minutes so
you want to take it off the list fine
sue me but I'm calling it a business
28 I and Love B shop this was definitely
a business this was my wife's business I
love my wife very much and she is very
very good at baking treats and so yeah
I'm going to call it my business because
we're married and I helped her with it
it was 90% her business it was a bake
shop it was an online e-commerce Shopify
store where she made cookie bars in our
house about 20 feet away from me and
they are the most amazing gourmet cookie
bars ever she sold them online and she
sold them at the local farmers market
right down there Road and people love

[11:01]
right down there Road and people love
them they're so good the problem with
this business it's very hard to scale
it's very very hard she would hand cut
all of these bars one by one by
one the cost is like 50 60 cents per bar
she sold them for three to four bucks
which seems good but the time it takes
and you individually wrap them and then
you individually put stickers on them
drive to the farmers market drive to the
post office it was a ton she did it she
started during her shortly after Co
um she built a huge fan base made a
little money lasted years at one point
we even put a mini fridge on our front
porch and friends would just come venmo
us and buy them um if nothing else it's
a way for us to teach our kids
entrepreneurship because they would help
in the kitchen they would help with the
farmers market especially my daughter
we've got great fond memories no regrets
from that business whatsoever um it's
just not the best and highest use of our
time so that was oven love bake shop and
there is something to that idea because
I think there's a chain of not cookie

[12:02]
I think there's a chain of not cookie
shops but cookie bar shops it's called
bars or something hipsterish of course
it started in Utah growing so there's
something to that like cookies with a
Twist number 29 was chunky mailers
chunky mailers is an idea that I have
had for years and this idea started with
a thesis of mine back to marketing ideas
right okay Direct Mail Works clearly
that's why we all get junk mail every
day but what if we had Direct Mail that
had
just something inside of it a lump a
penny a toothpick something some sort of
a widget inside of it where you're like
huh what is this it makes you want to
open it because most people never open
their direct mail rendering it
ineffective so I thought huh chunky
mailers this could be really interesting
I could order a ton of cheap widgets
from China at a penny a piece we could
take a postcard or a flyer stuff it an
envelope with the widget it could cost
40 50 cents to ship you've got to get uh
bulk mail through the Postal Service

[13:00]
bulk mail through the Postal Service
this could work and it could be a great
business because it's high ticket most
people are going to order thousands of
these things and if they work which they
should they got to be better than Direct
Mail Right and they don't cost much more
so what's the downside if they work then
they'll send these suckers every month
and so this is something that I just
kept in the back of my mind and then
2019 I started to launch it and I even
got a couple customers dentist I love
marketing to dentist but that's right
around the time when when a a partner
approached me about starting to invest
in mobile home parks and that was a
bigger opportunity and looking back it
was a bigger opportunity I'm glad I I
pivoted so I pivoted away from it I
still have the domain chunky mail.com
and then a year or two later I tweeted
about this idea in a thread and a guy
named Christian Ruff maybe you've seen
him on Twitter Ruf he saw my tweet he
dm' me he's like I love this idea I've
got time I can hustle I'm G to start
this and we're going to call it jumbo
mail marketing
and he did and I got my partner Kirk

[14:02]
and he did and I got my partner Kirk
involved my partner at Texas snacks he
was kind of the operator because we had
a third party logistics company and
someone's got to stuff and ship these
mailers Christian was operating out of
South Carolina I believe Kirk did most
of the work Christian did all the sales
calls and the marketing which was a lot
of work and I did very little I just
kind of connect connected the parties
and we got some customers we got some
case studies and then we ended up
selling it for a little bit of money to
a couple other young Hustlers that are
running it today and frankly I don't
know how well it's doing I don't even
know if I own any of this business maybe
1% maybe 10 I don't know maybe Kirk does
I have not even thought of that business
in a long time chunky mailers number 30
crave all right I want you to flash back
to
2017 Facebook what was going viral on
Facebook it was food videos specifically
you you you put a a DSLR camera above

[15:02]
you you you put a a DSLR camera above
like a pot and you make a salad or a
stir or something and you speed it up
like a time lapse and it's 60 seconds or
less there's a company called tasty
doing this I think they're still doing
it surely you saw them 2016 2017
basically tasty would put out a video of
anything they could make pancakes bowl
of cereal cake anything and it would get
tens or hundreds of millions of views
they were like the first person the
first company to unlock the fact that
people want to see food get made in 30
seconds or less 60 seconds or less so I
thought okay okay there's a lot of
demand for this I could do this I could
take these dumb videos what's it going
to turn into I have no idea what does
tasty turn into I think they now sell
widgets in uh in Walmart or you know
kitchen appliances and so me and my
close friend we rented a camera because
he's he's good at that stuff and we got
a dozen or two two dozen recipes we
bought a bunch of ingredients and I just

[16:01]
bought a bunch of ingredients and I just
built my house so we had this big nice
kitchen and we made we stayed up all
night it was like a 12-hour thing we
made like 12 videos in 12 or 24 hours
and then he edited them and it was
called crave instead of tasty and I
think we started a couple social media
Pages for it and then we were also
Partners in my LCD cycle business and it
started really taking off and so we
abandoned this and those videos are
sitting in my Dropbox folder somewhere
so I was crave number 31 man I might
need to do a part three here number 31
is Haley um now Haley was a it was an
outsourced Global Talent Agency just
like Shephard just like all of these
Global talent agencies you see and this
stemmed from me basically seeing all
these guys having success and having
fobo and thinking okay what they're
doing is nothing special they're posting
jobs to upwork they're building an
internal database of Global Talent until

[17:01]
internal database of Global Talent until
they don't even need upwork anymore and
then they're just placing that Talent
with inbound leads and there's no
shortage of demand for this so when we
first launched
co-founders the original thesis was to
do cohorts of college students 30-day
cohorts where we would take three hungry
high energy grateful optimistic college
students and I would meet with them
twice per week via Zoom remotely
and beforehand I would give them ideas
business ideas right maybe you need to
start a short form video agency maybe
you need to start a tree trimming
business and I would spend 30 days
meeting with them two three times a week
mentoring them training them teaching
them how to use zapier tools all these
things so they could launch these
businesses alongside us that was phase
one phase two they become profit sharing
partners of these businesses assuming
they made a profit and we met our 30-day
goal phase three is they drop out of
scho school or they graduate from school

[18:00]
scho school or they graduate from school
and they become a Prat Equity holder in
these businesses and I still love this
idea we're still kind of doing it
because our first cohort we did it with
a guy named Sam Juliana and Khloe and
with Sam we launched a Marketplace for
business owners and I'll talk about that
later with Juliana we launched uh
different type of marketplace for
business owners and then with Khloe we
launched Haley which was kind of like
Shepard and we went viral on Reddit
several times we thought I thought okay
Shephard is doing really well on Twitter
let's go attack a different platform so
we tried Reddit drove a bunch of leads
bunch of calls got a couple sales
nothing crazy and this taught me that
Twitter plus Global Talent is perfect
product audience fit okay that's kind of
a newer term that I heard and I love it
I use it all the time the right product
or service with the right platform or
the right influencer the right Guru
whoever ever for whatever reason Global

[19:01]
whoever ever for whatever reason Global
Talent Plus Twitter equals magic and so
I couldn't recreate that on Reddit and I
didn't want to recreate it on Twitter
because I thought it was already too
crowded this was like three years ago
two years ago I don't know it wasn't too
crowded it's still not too crowded I've
talked about that several times
so that business could still be rebooted
it's still around the website's still
there but I just have no energy to do
that right now I believe in in the
concept I believe in GL Global Talent
it's going to keep growing it seems like
a bubble on Twitter because we're all on
Twitter all day but I would reckon that
80 to 90% of the US Workforce has no
idea what the acronym VA means so still
right for disruption and growth number
32 Millennial Mormons okay wow this was
summer of
2017 I was running LCD cycle and it was
starting to slow down a bit and so I got
wandering eyes as I tend to do and at
the time WordPress blogs were just

[20:02]
the time WordPress blogs were just
always going viral okay the whole model
was write content distribute on Facebook
Facebook pushes it organically to your
WordPress blog goes viral you got a Blog
you collect emails you sell stuff
through the emails or you sell ads
Millennial mormon. comom was the website
it was a kind of a tongue-in-cheek part
satirical part faith-based part humor it
was a Blog for Millennial members of the
church of Jesus Christ of lity saints
such as myself and I love this blook I
read it all the time and I followed the
two or three founders pretty closely on
Facebook on social media and something
kind of stupid happened over time all
three of these Founders left the church
they lost their faith I don't know if
they became atheists or what not but
they no longer believed in the Mormon
faith and what really angered me there's
no better word for it than this what
angered me was the fact that they
converted this the site into what was a
bait and switch they started writing

[21:02]
bait and switch they started writing
content that was critical or
antagonistic of the church that they
were purporting to support and so I
thought that the right thing to do here
would be shut down the site put up a
popup it's like we we no longer believe
we're shutting this side down or we're
selling it but no they just started
Distributing content to believing
members that was engineered to pull them
away from their faith and I'm not a fan
of that in any religion I respect I
respect Muslims I respect the Amish
anyone that I especially respect
cultures that have their religion at the
Forefront of their lives because that's
what I strive to do and even if they're
doing something that I don't um
theologically agree with I really really
respect a commitment to a common goal
and a shared purpose and a higher power
and it angered me that they were trying
to pull people away from that
and so I can't remember if the founder

[22:01]
and so I can't remember if the founder
posted about it on Facebook or if I Cole
emailed him but one of the three
founders had the idea to sell the
business and I I can't remember if that
was my idea or his but I bought it I
bought the business for a few thousand
bucks it didn't have much revenue and my
whole intent was just to fix all this
broken crap and just to keep it going
that's it I I was not trying to make any
money whatsoever this was a passion
project and it was awesome I was not
alone in my distaste for this new format
of the blog and so I was able to recruit
a dozen or so volunteers writers web
designers to write articles and to turn
it around and to delete the anti-
Articles and to just clean up the site
and we did and it was awesome and we had
a good thing going and we rebranded we
made a new logo and then it it ended up
just falling by the wayside I don't even
remember what happened I had a couple
cool guys Bentley and Mike I think great
guys that were helping me a ton and then
a few others as well and it just fell by

[23:01]
a few others as well and it just fell by
the wayside and now a couple years later
our the president of our church who we
consider to be a prophet came out and
said try not to say the word Mormons
because that's just the name of our book
but that's not who we are and the book
is named after a person we're members of
the Church of Jesus Christ the latterday
Saints and so he really encouraged us a
couple years after this a few years ago
to stop using that word altogether so I
don't know what we would have renamed it
and a lot of kind of blogs didn't Ren
name it they're just like nah I'm going
to keep it the same and a lot did and I
for sure would have but I didn't need to
because it's no longer around so that
was Millennial Mormons next one was fast
Tree Care and fast Tree Care is exciting
because it's still going um fast Tree
Care was basically cohort two of
co-founders which was Zach and James
Zach started an AI newsletter which
pivoted to what is now voltera a
software that skilled nursing facilities
use to save money and James

[24:00]
use to save money and James
was over fast Tree Care I Love James
because when he first applied I thought
I was reading my own application because
he had fixed iPhones in college he was
just a hustler and that's pretty much
the only thing we have in common we
actually are quite different we come
from quite different backgrounds he's
six foot I don't know eight
African-American he's looks like an NFL
offensive lineman and his dad played for
USC comes from a family of football
players he's the bomb I love him
and I told him I gave him a few ideas
fast trer is one of them and he's like I
like that tree business idea I'm going
to move to Dallas said let's go so he
moved to Dallas I let him stay here at
my house for a few days he found a place
to live I paid him a salary from day one
and I gave him the Playbook I gave him a
truck he still drives it today and I
basically told him what to do I didn't
do it for him I didn't I've never even
been to one job site with him I've never
quoted one job with him he's done it all

[25:00]
quoted one job with him he's done it all
himself I just gave him a Playbook I
answer his calls we talk every week I
give him mentorship and fast Tree Care
is basically it's a tree tripping
business but we don't do any of the jobs
we Outsource 100% of the work at about
40 to 50% gross margins we have
virtually no overhead except gas and
time and it's a great business and we're
growing and we hosted a boot camp for it
a few months ago and we recorded it and
now we're selling that digital version
of that boot boot camp and encouraging
others to start tree businesses in their
area and it's awesome and eventually we
might pivot out of the physical Tree
triming Business and lean more into the
content side of the business because
it's working and we're encouraging
people to start businesses and that is
my passion so that's going great number
34 this also was not really a true
business it was more of a Blog this was
or 2010 I was a college student I had a

[26:01]
or 2010 I was a college student I had a
couple we had a good group of young
married College friends at the time and
meme Pages were I think it was like
college humor People of Walmart I don't
know if you remember that site people of
walmart.com that was really popular at
the time and we thought man there needs
to be a People of Walmart for outrageous
College fans right just like literally
just a WordPress blog with pictures of
fans Not Just college but sports fans
maybe a video maybe a picture just
something ridiculous and at the time or
right now as I say it it sounds like
such a stupid idea but people of Walmart
was a big thing and they made a lot of
money from organic traffic in banner ads
so we wanted to be a People of Walmart
for sports basically and I had two
partners in this and we put up a Blog
out fish okay out fish.com and we put up
a Blog we posted a few things and then
it just died they just just died there's
nothing there number 35 dmore this was

[27:03]
nothing there number 35 dmore this was
me and my employees buying Electronics
door too and I still love this idea I
don't know why there aren't teams of
people buying Electronics door to door
today there are teams of people selling
Pest Control selling solar selling
Roofing and selling alarm systems why
not buying Electronics I literally have
12 old iPads Nintendo switch phones
laptops laying around my house that I am
not about to go catalog wipe clean take
pictures of list on eBay list on
Facebook Marketplace answer questions
package ship it is a pain so the whole
business model here is just show up at
people's door have a nice Polo on that's
embroidered have your phone your phone
connects to like gazelle.com where you
can value these devices you've got venmo
or zel on your phone or PayPal and you
say hey I'm here to buy your old devices
can we come back later
or can we buy them now do you know of

[28:00]
or can we buy them now do you know of
any neighbors it's a great business so
when I had phone restore a small chain
of iPhone repair shops our second
biggest Revenue line was BuyBacks so
people would come in and either get
their device fixed or they would come in
and we would say your device is not
fixable we made 40 50 60 Grand a month
just buying devices in store and selling
on eBay when things got slow I would
send my employees out to the
neighborhoods and they would buy devices
door too and it worked and then you can
go to schools and you can do e-
recycling drives then you can do it in
bulk and the parents will send the
devices to school with their kids and
they can put it in a box and you can go
collect and then you pay the school
money and they're not as price sensitive
this is a great business and I think
more people should do it and I just
wrote about this in my newsletter so if
you want to read that go to chrisj

break this down in detail number 36 CTO

[29:01]
advising I consider this a business even
though it was more of a Perpetual
Consulting
gig this was back in my mcavey days when
I launched my token and I built a big
following on Twitter on another account
60 70 something thousand followers and
so these crypto projects would reach out
to me and say hey we want to make you an
adviser in our company we'll give you 1
to 3% of the total allocation of our
tokens which is like the crypto version
of shares in the company
maybe you come speak at a conference uh
maybe you tweet about us every now and
then and it was a great business I made
some pretty good money doing that just
being an adviser to these companies and
that lasted a couple years and it paid
some good bills and I enjoyed it and
then crypto crashed and it's funny
because all these contacts all these
companies they just kind of disappeared
they never really broke things off with
me they never really sent an email we
didn't ever tie it up they just kind of
disappeared into the night and that's
crypto number
37 my notes simply say stripe with a new

[30:00]
37 my notes simply say stripe with a new
rag uh because I'm not even pronouncing
that right most likely but I met this
guy on Facebook or somewhere somewhere
on the internet who lived in India who
had an e-commerce business it was a
Shopify store that he was driving ads to
that was doing really well and he was
selling the dumbest crap just dumb
kitchen gadgets Dum dumb dumb dumb stuff
okay but it was doing really well and it
was all drop ship and so here you have a
guy in India Drop Shipping stuff from
China to the US with Facebook cats I
don't even know what to say about that
anyway he had a problem because stripe
did not want to operate in India and
maybe they still don't I don't know at
least they didn't at the time this was
2018 2019 or so and so he said hey can I
use your stripe your stripe
account and I'll give you a cut of all
my sales if I can use a stripe account
and I said sure let's do it and so he
gave me 10% of everything that came
through that stripe account and it was a
good bit of money just 10% off the top
and I did nothing I did literally
nothing and it worked out great and then

[31:02]
nothing and it worked out great and then
I don't know if the Facebook ad
algorithm changed but this ended up
shutting down and it went away but I'm
still friends with that guy and he's a
cool guy all right next two businesses
I'm counting these as two it's really
just one and I'm almost out of time here
let's see how much time do I have yeah
about I'm out of time anyway these will
be the last two and then I'm gonna have
to do a part three and maybe even a part
four because we're only to number 38
these last two businesses were 10 and
$20 unlocks.com $10 unlocks.com and $20
unlocks.com they were the same business
it's pretty clever pretty automated I
used a software called Cubix Cub that
would go scan Craigslist for newly
listed iPhones for sale and it would
filter the ones that were locked to a
carrier nowadays this isn't really a
thing but back 2013 it's about 2013 um
you had phones that were either locked
to AT&T or Verizon or Sprint or T-Mobile
and then you had phones that were
unlocked that could be used with any
carrier worldwide and unlocked phones

[32:01]
carrier worldwide and unlocked phones
are worth more because they're more
compatible with things and it only cost3
to5 to unlock a phone there were eBay
sellers doing it there's a bunch of
places online you could find it it was
just asymmetric information most people
didn't realize that their phone was
unlockable and so I would Auto email
people that had just then listed an
iPhone for sale and I would search the
listing for either the word Sprint
T-Mobile Verizon or 18
and that told me that it was locked and
I would say hey your phone's worth
approximately $50 more if it were
unlocked why don't you unlock it before
you sell it you can do it at $10
unlock.com or you can do it at $20
unlock.com because I was just AB testing
it and I wanted to see if they were
price sensitive and they really weren't
$20 unlock.com um got maybe 20% Less
business but made 100% more money so
they would go to the website they would
check out they would submit their IMEI
number that would go directly to this
contact on eBay he would unlock the

[33:00]
contact on eBay he would unlock the
phone an automated email would go back
to them that would say hey restart your
phone it's unlocked and so with
virtually no interaction on my part I
was making some good money but that just
evented that it was a growth hack right
just like I said in the beginning of
this episode and it went away I don't
remember why it went away if that
software stopped working or there was
too much competition but it eventually
went away but I love that little
business and I wish I had it today
anyway that concludes part two of every
business I've ever started we will do a
part three and maybe even a part four

businesses go but thank you for
