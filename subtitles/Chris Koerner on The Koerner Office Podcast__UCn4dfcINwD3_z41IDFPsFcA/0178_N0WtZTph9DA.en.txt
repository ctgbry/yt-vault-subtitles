invested in 31 mobile home and RV parks
over the last 6 years and I firmly
believe it is the best real estate asset
class to double your money in two to
three years here's exactly how we do it
number one signage right after closing
we install a much much bigger sign why
because most of these parks are on a
major thoroughfare and the signage is
being completely wasted number two
Landscaping $220,000 in landscaping can
help you increase the rents by $50 per
month $50 per month across 50 pad sites
at a 7.5% cap rate equals
$450,000 in added value to the park
roads and trees we will fix the roads
and trees in month one there's always
potholes and there's always limbs
hanging too low touching the roofs of
the units $220,000 invested in roads and
trees will pay huge dividends to come if
you want to see the rest of these
there's 18 total go look at my latest
