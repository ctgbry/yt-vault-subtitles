this might not sound politically correct
but I promise it's true in 95% of cases
the moment you have the thought about an
employee huh I might need to fire them
one day you need to go ahead and fire
them right away because I have never had
that thought and not ended up firing the
person weeks or months later that
thought is a signal conversely I've
never had a rockstar employee where that
thought has ever even entered my mind if
you're keeping an employee that
eventually needs to be fired in a bad
position you are not doing them any
favors or your company any favors and
also usually when you have to fire
someone it's usually your fault because
there's a seat on a bus for everyone and
it's usually because you did not set
them up to succeed follow me for more
