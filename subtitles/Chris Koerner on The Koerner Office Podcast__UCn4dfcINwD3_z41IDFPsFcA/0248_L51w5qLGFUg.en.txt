[00:00]
so this is a great idea because a lot of
ideas we talk about it's very
approachable and you don't need much
money at all to start this so the idea
is this you play middleman between a
business or organization or university
that has a big parking lot and a bunch
of consumers that own a car that want to
sell that car so what you do is let's
say there's a community college or high
school right let's just use Allen Texas
as an example tell them what this is
first I'm getting there I'm getting
there so Allan High School is one of the
biggest high schools in the country they
have a massive part parking lot and of
course the parking lot's really only
used Monday through Friday aside from
the occasional football game so what
Sierra AutoFair is it's named after the
community college in the area and it is
an AutoFair where anyone that has a car
that they want to sell will go to the
parking lot of the Community College on
the weekend after paying about $149 to
Sierra AutoFair and they will have a
parking lot or a parking spot reserved
for them with a number they'll show up
they'll fill out a form they'll scan a
QR code they'll Park their car they'll

[01:01]
QR code they'll Park their car they'll
leave their keys with an attendant and
then they'll come back two days later to
pick their car up while they're gone
other potential car buyers will show up
to this AutoFair for free there's no
admission fee and they go they look
around they shop and they can take it on
a test drive if the car owner wants to
leave their keys some don't and then
it's great because you don't have to go
through the used car buying experience
you can go directly through a seller
it's they're very very high intent
buyers and sellers right there all in
one spot all than thanks to a company
that brings them all together on a
parking lot that would otherwise be
unused do you know how the purchase
works are they using like cashier checks
or they just like I don't even know
transferring Bitcoin it's completely up
to the buyers and sellers so Sierra
autoare doesn't even get involved there
like hey we made our 149 we're good we
don't care what happens they do like
tracking to see if the car is selling
for their testimonials and and
advertising and all that but what's Your
Gut take on copying this idea in another
Market okay specifically the cars or

[02:01]
Market okay specifically the cars or
just the idea of utilizing the parking
lot space the whole business I mean I
really like it I think it's if you can
get people there yeah it's a great
business model my question would be like
are they paying rent to the schools like
how are they getting that space what
does that look like I would assume they
are I have no idea how much what I don't
like about this is that it's like a
three-sided Marketplace almost you got
buyers you've got sellers and then you
have a venue right the venue would be
the easiest it's one point of contact
but then you got to get the buyers there
and you got to get the sellers there and
a Marketplace is hard enough when it's
on a website but in person man what if
you have a 100 cars there and five
attendees what if you have 500 attendees
and 10 cars there how do you balance
that because if you put out a Facebook
ad and the ad blows up for people to buy
cars but your ad for people to sell cars
doesn't blow up that's tough it's

[03:00]
doesn't blow up that's tough it's
embarrassing it's stressful very like
the stress of an in-person event vers
like an online event are incomparable so
I don't like that about it but I do like
how approachable it is and that it's a
proven model that you could replicate
somewhere else here's what I don't like
about the business I'll start there I
think there's a potential liability
right like do you have to get approval
from the city in order to host one of
these in order to conduct Commerce I I
just have no idea how would you work
with the school and then there's if
people are scammers like who do they
come after the potential liability to
you for organizing the event Etc that's
the downside I think the upside is
physical Goods probably high ticket
physical Goods because you don't want to
craft fair you don't want to have people
come and selling a bunch of like cheap
trinkets but you want to have a space
for people to come and bring their
things that would typically want to be
inspected pre- purchase potentially
Furniture cars maybe electronic

[04:00]
Furniture cars maybe electronic
like I'm trying to think of some of the
other things so finding that in any
Community I think is really easy anybody
could find the high school the question
is like how do you how would you go out
and drum up interest and demand because
like you said it's a three-sided
Marketplace would you start with the
supply would you start with the demand
first like where would you start all
right if you are watching this clip
right now you are watching this on
YouTube and if you are a fan of podcast
please check out my podcast while you're
at it because sometimes I have podcasts
that aren't on YouTube and sometimes I
have YouTubes that aren't on podcast so
check out the Kerner office on any
podcast platform or you can go to TKO
pod.com also my newsletter will throw
that in there there are no ads It's
weekly it's different content than my
podcast and YouTube newsletter. chrisj
cerner.com You'll see the link and we'll
see you there I would start small for
sure and try to get like 20 cars to pay
and I would plan it like two months out
in advance like it's like okay October
27th we're going to have this car Fair
it's usually $1.99 but it's $99 for our
first people I get 20 people and then I

[05:02]
first people I get 20 people and then I
shut it off and then it's like okay paid
these guys have already paid they're
going to be there now let's go find the
demand side and then just run I'd go
into all the Facebook groups and I would
just start posting like we do with our
home service businesses and just start
generating organic interest and I might
even charge like $ five dollar just so I
have some real intent to show up I'm
guessing for the Sierra one it probably
organically grew over time where each
year got bigger and it was word of mouth
right it was like pre- internet now I'm
trying to think you'd probably have to
spend a lot of money in order to get
awareness or do some like neighborhood
door knocking Flyers like those types of
things to get really creative but that
first year you're it's probably an
investment or that first car show is
probably an investment probably not
making any money but it's one of those
longtail Investments where you spend a
lot of money upfront and then it's just
sort of self-fulfilling every year after
the first year you've got the Facebook
group and people are talking about the

[06:00]
group and people are talking about the
next event and like you know what I mean
it's like I think there'd be some
builtin infrastructure after year one
but it would probably take I don't know
I would guess you're probably spending a
couple thousand dollars just to do the
first one as a test you're not
necessarily profitable on the very first
one here's what I'd do you ready oh
okay I would go to Facebook Marketplace
and auto trader.com and just start
messaging all these people private party
only that are already selling cars I
would say it's 100 bucks but you're
going to get a full refund after you
show up whether you sell your car or not
I just want to be sure that you show up
so if you never show up you're not going
to get a full refund but I need to make
sure that you're there so it's 100 bucks
it's 200 bucks you pay in advance now I
know you're going to be there I'm GNA
give you a full refund so they're
especially going to be there that way
you get the demand side okay you just
start messaging people that are already
selling cars not just any cars Nick but
cars that you know are likely to sell
the supply side you mean not the demand
side supply side yep yeah yeah yep and
then you can go into Facebook groups of

[07:00]
then you can go into Facebook groups of
people that are buying selling buying
and selling cars because that's a thing
and then you could start posting there
to get the demand side or you could just
use Facebook ads Facebook groups and all
that but I think if you can get 20 to 30
people to pay a 100 bucks to get their
car there it will actually be easier to
get the people to show up especially if
you can say hey we're going to have
Honda Civics there we're gonna have Ford
F-150s there like you're not going to
allow the Subarus or the weird things
you want things that are going to sell
because the whole idea is not a car show
like it's not just for people to come
look at like you you want to buy and
sell cars there yep you know what else
could be interesting you know those high
school fundraisers where they sell like
the little books and within the book are
like coupons to Chipotle and the
local Ries or Supermarket
whatever like you could probably put a
coupon in there as well like maybe pay
for a spot in that book and then when
all like just piggyback off of the high
school kids selling to all their friends
and family because essentially that's
what you want is the local community to

[08:00]
what you want is the local community to
and be active in buying and selling
these cars right yep that might even be
an interesting distribution
model yeah that might be an business
period well here's another idea I'm
wondering if you reach out to the people
on Facebook Marketplace that are selling
something that is in demand a Ford F-150
bestselling truck of all time and you
say hey I'm GNA charge you 100 bucks but
I'm gonna give a full refund and what I
want you to do is everyone that messages
you about your truck I want you to point
them towards our carfare and that way
it's much more efficient for you you
don't have to meet people up in the
Walmart parking lot at your house that
becomes your distribution Channel they
start funneling people to your car Fair
that's interesting so then you're
contacting people who they like it's
already a weird thing anyway to have
somebody come over to your house and
inspect your car you could scrape it and
be like all right anybody who's posted
in the last three days I'm G to message
and I know that anybody within the last
three days I'm going to schedule out
seven days in advance a car show for
them and just see who's interested in
okay bring your car

[09:00]
okay bring your car
here the potential problem with that is
if their card isn't running like how do
they tow it there I think they normally
would be that's an interesting way to do
it you're just scraping the new listings
and you're getting them to bring people
and you're pitching to them like hey
don't have people come to your house
well here's the pitch it's like hey you
have four interested parties for your
F-150 have them all come at 1:00 on
Saturday at the parking lot at the
community college all of them at one
then You' got fomo now you have a 4:1
ratio of people interested in the car
and you got I'll take 21 Grand 22 Grand
235 right is you ready for this are you
ready my
boy all right
then who knows if this will work then
you go to three local auto body shops
and you say hey I want you to sponsor
this we'll put your name there give us a
mechanic just give us one mechanic for
the hours between 10 and one okay what
do why a mechanic give people the option
to pay
for an inspection on that car so they're

[10:02]
for an inspection on that car so they're
just right there obviously you can't do
the full Suite because like you need to
actually jack up the car and get under
all that stuff but maybe it's something
quick where you can get a better idea of
what's wrong with the car what issues
might be associated with the car because
then the repair shop has like warm leads
right it's like well I just diagnosed it
but to get the rest i' really have to
bring you into the shop they're there
it's easy the customer pays for it it's
like oh 50 bucks for a quick inspection
and so essentially they're like paying
50 bucks for leads does that make sense
what I'm saying yeah I kind of I'm
hearing something in your mic is that
you eating because it almost sounds like
you want to have your cake and eat it
too Nick is that you want to monetize
from the sellers and from a local
business owner is that good H I don't
know because huh I was taught that you
only want one stream of Revenue but
maybe that's not right honestly I think
you were just hearing that because big
dogs got

[11:03]
so I love it I love it like why wouldn't
you because then you then you drisk a
little bit the investment it's like hey
you sponsor this yes you're getting
people to pay to actually bring their
cars but you're also getting the local
auto body shops to to or mechanics to
sponsor it dude this is such a perfect
audience to buy and sell through because
it's the person selling is about to have
cash on their hands the person buying
already has cash on their hands it's
high ticket they're very like anyone
showing up is highly incentivized to buy
or sell it's just like the best audience
you could take this idea let's say you
did it for electronics and you're very
specific let's just say it's I don't
know an Apple electronics fair and you
only can bring iPads and MacBooks and
iPhones that are of a certain generation
and Beyond like whatever you make it
specific you could do the same thing you
could have Geek Squad there and sponsor
it or like the local you break I fix

[12:00]
it or like the local you break I fix
there like and they're just diagnosing
these things on the spot so you have
again people sponsoring it but then also
people paying to be a part of it you got
your cake and you're eating it I mean
you could have a local you could have a
local moving company you know these
people buying and selling are likely
either have just moved or about to move
they're in a change of life moment you
got have all kinds of people come and
sponsor it because the more stakeholders
from the community that you get to be a
part of it the higher likelihood that
they are going to post and get the word
out about it right y so of course you
want as many people there who are
invested in it success so it's not just
the sellers it's also the sponsors like
if there's a way for the buyers
obviously that'd be cool I mean the
mechanics could even do something where
yeah we'll look at these cars but also
if you come from the community you don't
have to come to sell your car you could
for a quick I'm sure there's some $50
surve do oil changes on the
spot that's interesting mobile oil
changes did we just a new business Tire
changes break changes Johnny on the spot

[13:01]
changes break changes Johnny on the spot
the the best thing that you could happen
that could happen is if you had 50 cars
for sale and like 500 people show up and
like by 1M like everything's gone right
that would be the best scenario right
then it's like oh instead of doing this
next month we're going to do this again
next week yeah I think it'd have to be
somebody who's like really well
connected in their local market like
that
knows that space like those local
businesses that can kind of work the
buyer and seller side that might have a
a relationship and there may be somebody
who's like dude I could do this I know
the principal at the high school and I
know Jimmy dbob down at the mechanic
shop he'd for sure come down and maybe
pay a couple pennies rub a couple
pennies together to fix some oil I'll
tell you what honestly it'd be smart if
a used car dealership did this and it's
bringing people to their dealership and
it's like oh why would you do that
because these people don't want to use
car dealership they might doesn't it's
not like this is going to put used car
dealers out of business they might go to
look at that Acura and they don't really

[14:01]
look at that Acura and they don't really
like it but the dealer has an Acura that
they do like it's like the dealer can
just sit by idly watching someone else
profit off of used cars or they can get
involved yeah like you said if it grows
there are a host of businesses that
would be interested in having access to
that community that you're bringing
there right like use car dealerships
would be one of them Banks would be one
of them not just because they're going
to have cash on hand to deposit but it's
like oh you need to finance this car
like you can Finance private party
transactions
that's that's absolutely a thing so you
could have the Local Credit Union come
by and just be there in case anybody
wants to have a conversation there's a
million different businesses that could
be coming dude you could also just take
the registrations of the people that are
interested buyers they're not paying
anything you get their name email phone
number you could sell those leads five
times sell them to a bank sell them to a
auto detailing business sell them to a
car repair shop well dude okay take it a
step further you get their social
security number and their credit card
number dude you can sell that like eight
times on the black market you could

[15:00]
times on the black market you could
literally steal their
identity wow all right I like this idea
now here's my question to you it's like
a tangent on this idea are there not
mobile like oil change companies yes
they're growing like crazy right now are
they growing like crazy uhhuh yeah it's
like it's growing in popularity we need
to talk about that like I remember the
company when was it that you and I
talked about this was probably like
seven years ago where they would do
Mobile Gas m M that's growing like crazy
too it makes sense it totally makes
sense yeah so there's a business in
Huntsville Alabama that's very similar
to this carfair but it's just like the
three acre strip of land right off a
highway where there's no attendant and
you just pay $200 a month to park your
car for sale there with a for sale sign
and everyone just knows there's like a
sign and they just come and shop at
their Leisure there's no one there and
you just call the number and that's how
they monetize their land it's just raw
land with a gravel parking lot really

[16:00]
land with a gravel parking lot really
pretty smart right well because like
every Community Logistics really
wherever you live there's like that one
street or that one part of the street
where people Park their for sale
cars and they're not paying anybody for
that they're just like parked on the
street
yeah okay here's an idea you ready I in
I'm Cheryl Samberg right now I am
leaning in bro you are you are you're
going full Cheryl never go full Cheryl
so let's say you want to do this idea
you got to go buy land on some Highway
that's super expensive it probably works
really well for some Boomer that's owned
that land forever right and he's just
like monetizing it somewhat passively
what if you went to a a huge shopping
complex like a Walmart or a Hobby Lobby
that has a parking lot way bigger than
you need and you say hey kind of like a
a Dutch Brothers would lease land in the
middle of a parking lot you're going to
lease 20 parking spots on the edge of
the parking lot that's least desirable
to the shopping center because it's far
away from the shop but it's most

[17:00]
away from the shop but it's most
desirable to you because it's closer to
the road and you can literally just play
middleman you you lease the the 20
parking spots for 500 a month and you
could have people come Park their cars
for sale in that spot you could put some
signage up I like that idea less
because I I don't know I just I would
worry about the liability of K car gets
broken into and stolen you're not
pulling the actually card on me right
actually no I'm not pulling the actually
card on you I'm saying is if you went
and did it at a supermarket or a
Walmart for me it's like okay well then
we could set up cameras to make people
feel safer and then we could like
expands the scope of the services it's
simple on on paper but in actuality it's
l yeah yeah that's that's what I mean
like I still think it's a great I think
it's a really cool idea I just that one
would make me more nervous
because at least with the fair it's like
this is a designated time we're going to
be here between 10: and two cool done
you're out where you start like Su if

[18:02]
you're out where you start like Su if
and if you own the land cool great I'm
generating revenue from this and I
actually own the land but then you start
like suing the spaces from Walmart I
don't know makes I think to to your
point the liability let's say you could
easily go by Insurance okay you solve
that problem you really don't solve that
problem because the massive property
developer that owns that land is
probably just too scared of the
liability to care that you can just go
buy it they don't want it but if
assuming you could overcome that I see
this as a good way to get your feet wet
in the bigger idea right to prove the
demand prove the model maybe a month the
month Le because it's like listen Dutch
Brothers is gonna they're going to break
up your concrete they're going to put in
plumbing and electrical and all that if
you don't like this We're Gone in 30
days we're just testing something here
yeah I like it
