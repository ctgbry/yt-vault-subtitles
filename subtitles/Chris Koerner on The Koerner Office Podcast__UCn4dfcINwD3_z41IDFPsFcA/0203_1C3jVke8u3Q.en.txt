all right I got two business ideas for
you both in the coffee industry number
one coffee shops only use their space
for the morning and early afternoon but
in the late afternoon and evening
they're completely unused SL wased you
could start a business that helps coffee
shops enable this space during those off
hours as a co-working space kind of like
a 24-hour fitness where you can sell
them cameras software and a lock with a
keypad where people can go in there and
work in the evenings there's cameras on
them the whole time so they can't go
crazy and you can charge a monthly fee
the coffee shop can charge a monthly fee
and you can take a 20% cut of that kind
of like a Wei work for coffee coffee
shops but very low cost because you
don't need to go buy and rent space
number two coffee shops will pay you to
take their coffee grounds so you get
paid to take coffee grounds turn that
into a compost and sell it as a premium
organic composting product just like the
guys at EOS scraps did with produce go
watch the last episode on the ker office
I interview a restaurant chain owner
about these ideas and more
