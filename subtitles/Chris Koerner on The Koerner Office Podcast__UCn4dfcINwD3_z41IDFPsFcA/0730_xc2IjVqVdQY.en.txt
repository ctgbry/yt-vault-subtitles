[00:00]
I think there's a lot of opportunity,
especially for someone that's looking
for their first business. It's a really
easy business to start. You can easily
run this whole business on 15 hours a
week.
&gt;&gt; Every aspiring entrepreneur, they know
that having an audience is powerful, but
95% of them have no desire to get in
front of the camera. It sucks. I feel
like this is a great loophole where you
can just through Claude, through Chad,
use emails to build an audience. 35,000
people in a city is more powerful than a
million Tik Tok followers that are
worldwide. It is
&gt;&gt; $144,000 a year in revenue just on our
newsletter ad Instagram. It's 2800 for
one post. It's essentially a business
that can't lose. The longer I'm in the
business, the more money I'm going to
make. If I wanted to, in 3 years I could
run from here.
Now, only the OG fans of this podcast
will remember this, but a whole year and
a half ago when I first started this
podcast, it originally began as a
question and answer show, and it was
live. People would call in, ask me

[01:00]
live. People would call in, ask me
questions about their business or their
business idea, and I would answer it on
the spot. Well, in one of those first
episodes, this guy from Canada named
Jazz called, and he was thrown around
this idea for a business, and I gave him
some advice. He took the advice and now
a year later he has a profitable six-f
figureure business on his hands and he
just launched another business that's
already profitable that piggybacks on
that first business that I helped him
launch. This is a business that
literally anyone could start with almost
no money. The path to growth is very
clear and outlined in this episode. So,
let's go.
&gt;&gt; I think there's a lot of opportunity in
local newsletters. You know, especially
for someone that's looking for their
first business even, I would say, right?
It's a really easy business to start and
honestly as step by step as it gets,
right? Like Yeah. Like you're just
basically replacing the traditional
media and people are looking for
something new. So,
&gt;&gt; okay. So, why don't we start by you
telling me about your local newsletter?
Where's it based? How many subscribers
do you have? And Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, for sure. So, my local newsletter,
it's called Winnipeg Digest. It's uh

[02:01]
it's called Winnipeg Digest. It's uh
most people don't know about Winnipeg,
but it's like a cold city here in Canada
in the middle of it. And so I started it
here. I've been here for about 11 12
years, you know, and I was looking for
my first business to start on my own.
Beforehand, I had some experience like
growing social media followings to like
a 100K or something when I was 14,
selling them to e-commerce companies
like theme pages and things of that
nature. So wanted to start a business,
had seen Ryan Sneden, who does it in
Annapolis, do it, and had wanted to
start it for a while, honestly. And so I
thought, okay, it can't really be too
difficult. Started it in last year,
April, so 2024 April. And then since
then, we now reach over 100,000
Winnipeggers. That's uh a combination of
social media and newsletter. So we have
about 73,000 followers on social media.
&gt;&gt; There's like 800,000 people in Winnipeg,
right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's about 800K. And then our
newsletter is at about 35,000 people
now. So

[03:00]
now. So
&gt;&gt; Okay. So 70 something on social, 35,000
on news.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So that's split now. And uh
yeah, today we're now trying to start
other businesses off for
&gt;&gt; Okay, we'll get into that. Trust me, I'm
very curious about that. Now, you live
in Winnipeg, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, I live here. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; How well do you know the market? How
long have you been there?
&gt;&gt; I've basically grown up here. Like I've
been here for over 12, 13 years now, so
I know the market fairly well, you know,
and Winnipeg isn't necessarily a
tech-savvy city. I could, you know, it's
I kind of make the joke here that I can
copy anything off of Twitter and paste
it here and it would do well. Yeah. So
it's like not a techsavvy city at all,
unlike Calgary or something in Canada.
And so, you know, it's a really easy
market to start any business here in. So
there's low competition.
How successful would you be if you took
a let's say Austin, Texas, 800,000
people give or take. How successful
would you be if you would have taken the
exact same playbook and done it in

[04:01]
exact same playbook and done it in
Austin? Austin might be a bad example
because they probably have like a
hundred local newsletters. So ignoring
that, just the fact that you were not a
local, how would you have done?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean if I were to personally
start it, I would start it somewhere
where you do have a first movers
advantage, you know? So that's what
Winnipeg did so well for me is because
there was no not even an Instagram
account that just compiled all the
events here,
&gt;&gt; right? Let alone having a newsletter
based on it. So it was a really easy
market for me to kind of take a monopoly
over. And the thing is now if anyone
else starts a local newsletter here in
Winnipeg, their cost for acquiring a
subscriber is automatically going to be
much higher, right? So yeah,
&gt;&gt; I would highly recommend if someone is
starting one. So I know a few people in
Texas that are starting one and they are
now targeting suburbs around Austin
rather than the actual city of Austin.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So gun to your head, if you had to
choose between a city you were very
familiar with but didn't have a first
mover's advantage and a city that you

[05:01]
mover's advantage and a city that you
weren't familiar with but did have his
first mover's advantage, which would you
choose?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean I think there's multiple
models to go about this. You can
definitely even partner up with someone
in another city. I would probably go
with the place where I have the first
mover's advantage just because acquiring
the acquisition cost per subscriber will
be much lower, right? Like my I was
acquiring subscribers for 15 cents
Canadian, right?
&gt;&gt; Oh. Oh. So like 12 11 cents US.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So even today, like even today I'm
acquiring subscribers for like Matt's
like $130 or something like that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So
&gt;&gt; what is your subscriber worth give or
take?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so they're worth about if I am
able to sell out every single ad slot in
my newsletter for the year and we only
do one ad slot per newsletter. About8
to$9 a year is kind of what they're
worth at the current open rate we have
&gt;&gt; per year too. And I'm guessing at your
normal o open rate, they're probably
going to be ran for like five plus

[06:00]
going to be ran for like five plus
years.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, easily. Like we have a 0.05% 05%
unsubscribe rate or something like that.
&gt;&gt; Geez, that's so good. So, it's like you
kind of created slashinvented this money
machine that turns a dollar into $40 or
$50 as long as you're willing to be
patient. You don't get that immediately.
It takes five years to get the LTV
lifetime value. But nonetheless, like
you created this template and now put in
one, get out 50
&gt;&gt; 100%. I mean, it's obviously a much
easier step than done. Like I think the
biggest problem that local newsletters
run into is not is not building the
audience. Anyone can build the audience.
Anyone can turn on Facebook ads and put
out a decent product. The thing that you
most likely end up will have problems
with is getting sponsors is selling
local businesses on a whole new concept
of advertising. Yeah. So I think that's
the biggest problem that most folks run
into is definitely anyone can get to 10
to 15,000 subs. Anybody. It's just that
acquiring sponsors for 10 to 15,000

[07:02]
acquiring sponsors for 10 to 15,000
subs.
&gt;&gt; Well, here's a perfect example, and
we're going to get into this when you
talk about how you're going to launch a
business based on this. If I want a
sponsor for this podcast, they're going
to pay me, call it, $20 per thousand
views,
&gt;&gt; right? If I use Spotify ads, like the
annoying ads that Spotify puts in
themselves, which I turned on for a week
just to test, and I'm turning it off,
it's $6 per thousand views downloads,
which is nothing. Like, that is pennies,
right? So, $6 from Spotify, $20 if I
andor my agent go out and hustle to find
sponsors. But if I build my own business
that's in this niche, in this vertical,
it's relevant to my audience, and I put
in an ad for it, it's $200 per thousand
views, it's not it's a 10x difference,
right? Like a 50x difference based on,
you know, the lazy way of just putting
Spotify midroll ads for, you know,
Toyota, Chevrolet, local dealers, which
I'm just not going to do. So, there's so

[08:01]
I'm just not going to do. So, there's so
much power in having a business mind and
having a newsletter or an audience
because you can vertically integrate and
sell your own stuff and not the local
bakery or whatever it is, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It gets me excited you talking
about that cuz like when we started the
newsletter, my whole idea was, hey, I'm
going to build companies on top of this.
And anybody I would talk to would be
saying, yeah, but that's like
unrealistic thing. Like, you know, it's
tough to obviously run multiple
businesses. And I totally understand
that. And you know, we've obviously
shifted the vision a little bit, but if
you're going to just go sell ads on top
of your local newsletter, it's going to
be really hard to monetize. Like, you
will cap out at lacks $500,000 a year.
Like, that is the absolute like if you
have everything perfect and a great
market, you'll still cap out at 500k a
year.
&gt;&gt; But some people are hearing that and
thinking, I'm cool with that.
&gt;&gt; It's definitely not a side gig or it's
not a it's not a bad place to start,
right? But like if you're really trying
to make serious money, you're trying to
grow the business, you'd have to

[09:00]
grow the business, you'd have to
vertically integrate it at some point.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. So 35,000 subscribers. Uh
how many do you send per week?
&gt;&gt; We send out three times a week.
&gt;&gt; Okay. How did you land on that? Did you
start with that or did you finish with
that?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So I mean we started with once a
week. We felt that there was too much
content for us to cover in just a one
time a week edition. Then we went to two
times a week. And this was like in a
span of a month, by the way. like this
was not we didn't wait too long. We
started once a week, felt there was too
much content, then went to two times a
week. Again, still too much content to
cover. Did three times a week and then
we sometimes started running out of
content. So, we're like, okay, so three
times a week cadence is like a good
amount where even if one email is
shorter than the other two, no one's
really complaining about that.
&gt;&gt; Let's talk about your content. Is it
like local news? Is it updates? Is it
opinion pieces? When we started, I
remember Ryan saying this one thing when
we started. It was everything other than
crime and politics. And that's exactly
what we have run with as well. So, it's

[10:01]
what we have run with as well. So, it's
basically events, community updates,
city updates, any new bylaws, anything
that is happening in the city basically
away from crime and politics is what we
promote.
&gt;&gt; Okay? It would go a really long way if
you just subscribe to this channel. It's
just a good way of saying Chris, thanks
for the value.
&gt;&gt; Now, I understand politics. You don't
want to alienate half of your
subscribers, right? Why not crime?
&gt;&gt; Like we will occasionally talk about it
saying something like, "Oh, the most
wanted report has come out for
Winnipeg." Like, you know, just to make
people aware of it. We don't necessarily
want to talk about like, you know,
someone getting stabbed or something
like that, right? Especially like
&gt;&gt; it's not the vibe.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not the vibe. And I mean,
Winnipeg is known as like the murder
capital of Canada. And so and so because
of that reason we're like you know what
we're going to change the narrative
&gt;&gt; and also from a storytelling perspective
it sounds amazing when we say when we
say something like you know where
everyone says Winnipeg is boring and
we're trying to change that narrative.
&gt;&gt; Yeah I love that. I just had an idea

[11:02]
&gt;&gt; Yeah I love that. I just had an idea
like if you find yourself running out of
content, I feel like you could
supplement with like opinion pieces like
Greg from, you know, from this
neighborhood ranks the three best ice
cream shops in Winnipeg, you know?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, 100%. And uh we and I also
integrate a lot of our socials. Like on
socials, we'll say here are the 10 best
homes listed in Winnipeg this month or
something, right? So we can integrate a
lot of that into our newsletter as well.
&gt;&gt; How many words on average are your
emails? 400 to 2600.
&gt;&gt; So, pretty long. Pretty big.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, they're fairly long. But
honestly, half of it is events because
each event has like a small description
associated with it.
&gt;&gt; What are your open rates and
click-through rates like today versus
first couple months?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, they've stayed fairly
consistent. We've always been above 50%.
Click-through rate has always been in
the ballpark of like 8 to 12%.
&gt;&gt; Oh, crazy high, man.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So open today is about 56 to 60%.

[12:01]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So open today is about 56 to 60%.
So it can vary obviously depending on
the set.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Now I've noticed there's like a there's
like a a law of newsletters where the
bigger it gets the more your open rate
drops. Like in my experience are are
have you seen that like did it start in
the 60s and then very slowly ticks its
way down? Yeah, I mean it did do that
and then what we started doing was we
cleaned our list like two or three times
but that was honestly kind of a mistake
on our end because sometimes what ends
up happening is for example beehive in
this case might be showing that someone
is not receiving an email and they might
be but sometimes it might be opening an
email and it's showing that they're not
opening an email right so it can so that
isn't always fully tracked yeah right
and so the if you start cleaning your
list you might start cleaning people
that are actually reading your email.
&gt;&gt; I've had the same mistake. I set up an
automation in Beehive to clean the list
for me and I would just every day I wake
up and I'd see these drops overnight and
it's like h like is that the right thing
to do? And I finally turned it off and

[13:02]
to do? And I finally turned it off and
I'm just going to do it manually like
once every two months.
&gt;&gt; Agreed. I think that's the best way to
do it.
&gt;&gt; What is your writing style like? Are are
you writing all these emails yourself?
What is the vibe of the newsletter?
&gt;&gt; It's super casual. It's like a very very
casual vibe where it's almost like I'm
talking to them, you know? It's not
written in newsletter jargon. It's a
fifth grader reading level. Super easy
to understand. Even when we're talking
about like city bylaws being passed,
we're making sure everybody can
understand what's happening. And the
feedback we get whenever we see a reader
out and about, it is that that hey, we
love the positive outlook that you have
on the city and the conversational tone
of your writing. And so that's the way
that we've written it. It's not any news
news jargon that we're using in there.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. What about AI? Are you using AI to
write this or to help write it?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, if we like started writing
this whole thing on our like just
ourselves, it would probably take like
eight hours a day or something. So we do
have definitely use like Claude and

[14:00]
have definitely use like Claude and
ChachiBT. And then I have two VAS who
are kind of responsible for one is
responsible for events, the other one's
responsible for writing and they kind of
do everything uh everything for me. So
that's why it's a little bit automated.
&gt;&gt; So it's like the first draft through
Claude/Judge and then a human goes
through and cleans it up.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So they do that and then I go
through and uh usually like late at
night, probably 11 12:00 p.m. I'm
usually going through final draft, an
hour of me looking over it, making final
changes.
&gt;&gt; It's funny you say like it would take
eight hours a day, but up until 2 years
ago, it's what everyone did, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. It's been super helpful for
us. Uh we haven't gotten into like
automating things just yet, like
completely automating things, but that's
something that, you know, we're looking
into.
&gt;&gt; What is your time involvement per week
on this
&gt;&gt; because of sponsors, like bringing in
sponsors and sending ad drafts and
things that nature like it ends up being
probably close to 20 hours a week.
&gt;&gt; It used to be a lot more cuz I used to
write every edition and also make a
social post and stuff.
&gt;&gt; When we also were growing our social

[15:01]
&gt;&gt; When we also were growing our social
media following, it was very heavy video
reels. So it was going out and recording
them, editing voiceovers. Now we've
shifted to completely just carousels and
so that's made our life a lot easier as
well.
&gt;&gt; What is your revenue like your monthly
revenue today?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, today it's about it can range from
12 to 15,000 currently. So that's the
general revenue and then
&gt;&gt; that's amazing.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's good. Like it grown a decent
amount I would say in the last like six
months is where a a bunch of it's
starting to compound. No,
&gt;&gt; I always like to use like a rough 50
cents per month per subscriber. It
sounds like you're kind of close. Well,
actually, you might even be above that
because that's at 5 cents per week.
Yeah. So, if you were to extrapolate
that out, you'd be probably closer to 60
or 70 cents per subscriber per month if
it was five per week, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. That's about the average that we
try and go for. We also haven't explored
any of the um like negative chat and
things of that nature. Like, I think
that's something that we would do want
to explore eventually. I just haven't
gone around just yet.

[16:00]
gone around just yet.
&gt;&gt; And for those listening or watching,
negative CAC is negative customer
acquisition costs where instead of
paying Facebook for your leads, like
you're getting paid for your your new
subscribers, right? Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And is that kind of like from what I
understand that to be, you pay Facebook
for a subscriber and then they go
through a flow like they subscribe and
then you say, "Hey, check out these
newsletters." And then once that's done,
it's like, "Hey, fill out this form."
And then you can kind of sell those
leads. You can do that. The way we would
most likely go about doing it if we did
it was like let's say if we sold a
discount card or something, right? Like,
oh, buy this discount card for $20 and
get 10% off these 20 restaurants or
something, right?
&gt;&gt; What we would do is let's say if we're
getting a subscriber for a dollar,
right? And so even if one in 10 people
convert, right, we're basically making
money every single time we're paying
Facebook, right? And that's without
going to sponsorships at all. That's
just like just for seven days basically.

[17:00]
just like just for seven days basically.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I think people also call it
self-liquidating ads, right? Where you
make money for acquiring customers and
then you you show them ads and make more
money. That's the gold standard. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But it takes time. Like there's a lot of
things at play, right?
&gt;&gt; 100%. And I mean a lot of things are
local newsletters unlike traditional
newsletters where you can just plug
other newsletters and you know get them
to subscribe to that. The downside with
local newsletters is that you can't just
plug any any other AI newsletter or
something, you know, start making money
off of that. It's
&gt;&gt; true.
&gt;&gt; You almost need local offerings that you
can offer these readers. So, it doesn't
feel like you're a foreign company or
something like that. Should feel below.
&gt;&gt; I feel like someone needs to build a
Spark Loop for local newsletters. And
for those listening, Spark Loop, Spark
Loop is like a a referral engine for
newsletters where you subscribe to the
what's the name of your newsletter?
&gt;&gt; Winnipeg Digest.
&gt;&gt; The Winnipeg Digest and then you get a
popup five other newsletters. What
you're saying is that there aren't you
don't want to compete with yourself in

[18:00]
don't want to compete with yourself in
Winnipeg. So you don't even want to
refer them. A B there's no one else to
refer really. So, if there was like a
spark loop that could aggregate all the
restaurants or auto repair businesses in
Winnipeg and you could sell them leads
for every time they check that box,
right? Wouldn't that be an interesting
business?
&gt;&gt; I think that's a really good business,
especially because well, we can also
promote other local newsletters, right?
Because they're completely different
cities and someone living in Winnipeg
doesn't care about Austin, Texas,
&gt;&gt; right? No. So that's why I think that's
a big problem for at least solving that
negative CAC issue for us is, you know,
you kind of have to make a custom
offering
&gt;&gt; just for your subscribers.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But like if I could subscribe to
your newsletter and then get like $20 in
Kohl's cash for checking a box,
therefore become being added to Cole's
email list, that could be pretty
valuable for Kohl's and for you, right?
&gt;&gt; Agreed. I think I think that's a that's
a good idea. And then you would
obviously have to just put in put in

[19:00]
obviously have to just put in put in
place those partnerships, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; If you weren't chasing after sponsors,
which I know is like most of your time
right now, how much time would it be
taking per week to run this?
&gt;&gt; Man, like seven hours at max probably.
Yeah. Just from
&gt;&gt; It probably takes about an hour a day
for reviewing content for Instagram,
sending, you know, making sure the
content is good for the newsletter and
things of that nature. Yeah. About seven
hours a week. Okay. Outside of Claude,
Chetchup Bet, what does your tech stack
look like for this?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean we use Beehive for sending
a lot of things Beehive does, right? So,
I would say analytics and everything we
get from Beehive sponsorships. I track
everything in notion. I don't I haven't
really invested in any specific CRM for
just tracking sponsors. So, I've built
kind of a semi-custom one in notion.
Yeah. Other than that, it's just chass
clawed and nothing really other than
that and Instagram is yeah, nothing
significant. Canva,

[20:00]
significant. Canva,
&gt;&gt; I mean, beehive is amazing. Do do you
use like their boost features or any of
their other like monetization features?
&gt;&gt; I don't because again those ads don't
apply to local. It's not a good
experience for the reader at the end of
the day. And yeah, like we want to make
money based like using the reader as
future customers for other businesses.
So, if we start providing a bad
experience, they're going to start
opening less and it's just a, you know,
downward spiral from there.
&gt;&gt; How much are you testing your subject
lines or your preview lines, if at all?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we're usually I mean, now I've
gotten pretty good at basically knowing
which ones are going to do well. In the
beginning, we used to test them almost
every edition. Now, we don't really test
them because I know that I automatically
almost know which one's going to do
better or not.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Have you noticed that like on the
whole shorter just does better shorter
subject lines
&gt;&gt; 100%. Under five words like time should
be in there. Something like this
weekend.
&gt;&gt; Urgency.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, urgency. And so, you know, I would

[21:00]
&gt;&gt; Yeah, urgency. And so, you know, I would
say under five words kind of under five
words and under 40 characters.
&gt;&gt; I love that. So, people just want to say
everything, but it's like you're you're
not leaving anything to the imagination.
The more you say, the less reason they
have to click because you're answering
their question, the subject line.
&gt;&gt; 100%. Yeah. Like I think today's was
something like new Winnipeg Costco
location. That's it.
&gt;&gt; They click because they want to know
where when
&gt;&gt; exactly
&gt;&gt; right. You could put like hey on the
corner of X and Y new Costco location
opening
&gt;&gt; you know August 3rd.
&gt;&gt; How small is too small for a market
because I know you're in Winnipeg but
you're you live this world. You're
talking to other local newsletter
operators. What is your experience?
&gt;&gt; Anything under 100K is uh too small. I
would say even 150k, you know, I would
say anything under that is almost too
small. So, you want to then broaden out,
maybe do your county or something like
that. Anything over a million, I almost
find it's too much cuz then you have way
too much to cover. Unless you're doing
five times a week. If you're doing five
times a week, you maybe be able to get

[22:00]
times a week, you maybe be able to get
away with it. But over a million, you're
pretty much pushing it with the amount
of things that you can add in there. And
it's almost over a million people. The
city is so spread out that let's say I'm
not sure with Austin, but someone living
in South Winnipeg is probably not going
to care about things happening in North
Winnipeg.
&gt;&gt; It's like a different world.
&gt;&gt; Exactly. It's almost a different cities
at that point. So, if you're over a
million, you should almost have two
different newsletters for like splitting
the city in half or something like that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; What are some other creative customer
acquisition strategies if if paid ads
just aren't your thing?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean honestly like you're like
if you're going to spend $100 I would
say $90 should be spent on just Facebook
ads you know if you're going more the
creative route Instagram obviously helps
you had great success with it using many
chat we haven't fully explored that
channel that's something we're now
exploring referrals are huge though
having for example for us we do
restaurant guides and hiking guides and
we change those according to the season

[23:00]
we change those according to the season
that's about to come up so let's say
with winter it's going to be top 50
things to do in Winnipeg this winter,
right? And so we kind of change that up
according to the season. And so referral
guides are huge for us as well.
&gt;&gt; Are you more interested in growing
horizontally and adding more local
newsletters or vertically and just going
to five days a week, more sponsors, like
more vertical integration by launching
other businesses that you promote with
this?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, ideally, so I've kind of
considered both channels or both kind of
ways. If you go vertically, if you go
horizontally, there are other companies
that do this like 6 a.m. City and things
like that that I just find your CPMs
drop really drop a lot just because then
you start having national brands which
are not going to pay you $100 per
thousand views, right? And so if you
start working with Nike, they're not
looking to they're just going to pay you
a lump sum which is going to be like $10
CPM if that. So that's why I find that
rather than just going horizontal, I

[24:00]
rather than just going horizontal, I
would rather prove out a money model in
my own city, right, than go to other
cities. So for example, if I start a
business on top of this, right, and I
know that, okay, on average, each
subscriber to me rather than being worth
$7 now is worth $15 a year. Then I'm
competing on a whole different game when
I go to another city, right? Like let's
say if I expand into Calgary, what's
going to happen is when my competitor
can only acquire subscribers for maybe
$2 a sub, I can acquire them for five
and still have a great um rorowaz on on
the customer acquiring.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Rorowaz, return on ad spend. Yeah.
From those things,
&gt;&gt; you you mentioned CPM, the amount of
money you can charge per thousand opens,
right? Not per thousand subs, but opens,
right? What are you charging nowadays
for ads? We're about $70 something
dollars, like probably $75 CPM. Wow.
&gt;&gt; To for local for local advertisers and
then a lot of them, so we sell annual
spots. Like that's kind of our business

[25:01]
spots. Like that's kind of our business
model is we sell exclusivity. Like if
anyone is looking to sell sponsorship,
don't sell one-off sponsorships. You're
not going to make money. You want to
sell annual sponsorships on a
exclusivity basis. So if we work with
one HVAC company, we're not working with
any other HVAC company for that full
year, right? And so you're trying to
sell exclusivity is what your main thing
you're trying to sell is. So now when we
go to a sponsor, we say, "Hey, you're
basically getting a monopoly over
100,000
and it's the only form of advertising
that lets you do that."
&gt;&gt; And you said only one ad per newsletter.
So 19,000 opens per send times 75,
you're looking at like 1,400 for one
send.
&gt;&gt; That's our cost for a one-time
advertiser. So if if someone's coming in
just a one time ad like they have an
event coming up or something that's what
they'll pay for our u Instagram it's
double. So it's $2800 for one for one
post.

[26:00]
post.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And then obviously if they're
annual subscribe or if they're annual
sponsor they get much better ad rates
than $70 per per thousand sets.
&gt;&gt; How much better?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So right now we're charging about
$12,000 for 12 newsletter ads. So one
per month.
&gt;&gt; One per month. Okay. That way you don't
like oversaturate yourself. They don't
see it too often.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. 100%. And and what ends up
happening is, you know, so we send out
give or take, let's say, 12 newsletters
per month. Times that by $12,000 a
month. So that's I think $144,000 a year
in revenue just on our newsletter ads.
That doesn't even include um our
Instagram, right?
&gt;&gt; All right, guys. You know, I'm always
looking for ways to help you make more
money with less effort. Well, HighLevel
is too, and I think that's why I like it
so much. While everyone else out there
is switching between 10 different apps,
HighLevel puts everything in one clean
dashboard. You can send emails, track
leads, build funnels, schedule
appointments, everything. And no more

[27:00]
appointments, everything. And no more
logging into a bunch of different
platforms. Your clients think you're
some tech wizard when really all you did
is stop making things so complicated.
Sometimes the best ideas are the simple
ones. So check out
gohighlevel.com/krrisker.
link below if you want to see what I
mean. If you use that link, they'll give
you a 30-day free trial.
&gt;&gt; And so, you know, we're kind of looking
at in the ballpark of about 200k when
when you kind of combine everything
together and then where yeah, we have
some other like local markets and stuff
that we end up running throughout the
year. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; If someone's launching this, like what
types of local businesses, local
sponsors should they target? because
you've probably learned like this. I'm
sure this isn't accurate, but like an
auto repair store may be much more
likely to give you money but not get
much ROI out of it. So, they're not ever
going to do a long-term thing. Whereas a
local bookstore might be really hard to
convert, but they see a really big
return on investment and therefore could
become like a highly recurring customer.
What kind of things like that have you
learned about the types of sponsors that
are best for local newsletters?

[28:00]
are best for local newsletters?
&gt;&gt; I would say probably like event venues
are great, right? So, we have an event
venue who is our annual sponsors. They
do I think this year they're going to be
spending $40,000 a year with us, right?
So, they're a huge they're probably our
biggest advertiser. Other than that, I
just tell people sell people on LTV,
just say that, hey, um for lifetime
value.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, if let's say a dentist is
coming to you or you're talking to a
dentist, you ask them, right, what's on
average a customer worth to you? A
customer is worth $5,000 to me. Great.
So, if you're going to spend $10,000
with me, I just need to get you four
customers for you to double your um
return on ad spend with us, right? And
you're telling me I can't get you four
out of 35,000 people, right? So, it's an
easy sell to make.
&gt;&gt; Oh, I love that. And honestly, a
dentist, a customer for a dentist is
probably worth a lot more than that,
right? Because they might stay with them
for five or 50 years.
&gt;&gt; 100%. So, dentist, HVAC, plumbing,
roofing,
&gt;&gt; high ticket stuff,
&gt;&gt; anything or highly recurring.
&gt;&gt; Exactly. And like what we do is we
actually run a survey. The second

[29:01]
actually run a survey. The second
someone signs up, they get straight sent
to a survey that they fill out. What
part of the city they live in, do they
own a home, not own a home, are they
looking to sell a home, buy a home,
upsell, down, like are they looking to
what are they looking to do essentially?
Like what what is their current
household income? And so that then
allows us to go to advertisers and say,
"Hey, 75% of our audience are
homeowners." And that's a very valuable
audience for you. So, I highly recom it
will end up working out for you.
&gt;&gt; What percentage of your subscribers fill
out that survey?
&gt;&gt; About a 87% uh like completion rate.
&gt;&gt; Are you serious? 87% fill out the
survey.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, about
&gt;&gt; That's insanity.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; That is cra And how many questions are
in it?
&gt;&gt; Eight.
&gt;&gt; Holy cow. I would have thought 5%.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I just think local newsletters are built
different. They're just so loyal and
they're just like they're contributing
to the community. They're like being a
good citizen by contributing to your
capitalism, right? Which you're not

[30:00]
capitalism, right? Which you're not
complaining.
&gt;&gt; I mean I mean to be to be fair though, I
think if anyone is starting one, please
take this from a perspective of when
you're bringing on advertisers. Don't
bring on casinos or clubs if that's not
the vibe you're trying to set,
&gt;&gt; right? Short term you might be shooting
yourself in the foot turning down
revenue, but long term your readers
really do appreciate that. You know that
they don't have to because your readers
are mainly going to be 70% females, 80%
females between the ages of 35 to 65.
They're not looking to learn about clubs
and casinos. So you're much better off
just like actually handpicking the
advertisers that are going to add value
to their life as well. But I'll tell you
what, that demographic that you just
named is like the most valuable
demographic. Those are the the spenders
in the household. Yeah, they are. Right.
&gt;&gt; And that goes back to like the new
business that we're starting and how why
we have picked that business as well.
&gt;&gt; I'm going to get to that. I'm saving the
best for last. What survey tool do you
use for that survey?
&gt;&gt; Beehive. So, you can build a survey

[31:00]
&gt;&gt; Beehive. So, you can build a survey
behive. Yeah, it's it's fairly easy.
&gt;&gt; Why don't I have a survey on my
newsletter? I feel like an idiot. Like I
should totally do that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that and polls. I think th those
two are the most
&gt;&gt; I do polls.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, those are the most used like
things that you should probably do if
you're running a news site.
&gt;&gt; How successful are you in finding
sponsors in your subscriber base? Like
putting an ad in there for yourself
saying, you know, your ad here. Does
that work?
&gt;&gt; It does sometimes, but for smaller
companies, I would say, you know, and
that's not really a target audience. So,
a lot of the larger advertisers are
relationships you're building or they'll
reach out or something like their
marketing coordinator is some 23 year
old that follows our Instagram and has
no idea that even our newsletter even
exists. So, they'll reach out wanting a
feature on the Instagram. I'll hop on a
call with them, sell them this whole new
world of newsletters, and then actually
that's where I get the ad dollars from
them from. So, it's usually like the
foot in the door is like some
23-year-old marketing coordinator who
was like on their team and thinks it's a
cool idea to be featured on our
Instagram.

[32:00]
Instagram.
&gt;&gt; Are there any like other perks like
local perks like priority seating or you
ever get recognized? Any intangibles
like that?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so I mean when I had my face
associated with the brand so in the
beginning we did a lot of reels. That's
how I grew the Instagram following
pretty heavily. We did a lot of reals, a
lot of restaurant reviews and things of
that nature. So I would be recognized
like five, six times a day.
&gt;&gt; That's amazing.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Like I would be at the gym.
&gt;&gt; Was that cool?
&gt;&gt; It was cool for sure. But then I kind of
it was also concerning at the same time
because I was like, "Okay, if I sell
this, if I ever want to sell this thing,
I can't have my face associated with
it." So that's why we switched more to
carousels to a way where I disassociate
my face from it and then I can it
becomes a sellable asset at the end of
the day.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's fair. All right. So you're
dabbling in Christmas lights. Is that
right?
&gt;&gt; That's the new business we're starting.
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Well, is that the business or have you
done other like vertically integrated
businesses for this?
&gt;&gt; No. So, that's like our first business

[33:00]
&gt;&gt; No. So, that's like our first business
on top of this. Yeah. It was the
thinking behind it was it's seasonal. It
works great. It doesn't. We forget about
it. Right. Second thing is is that it's
high LTV customers. So, let's say it's a
leasing model. So, you don't sell the
Christmas lights, right? So when we
lease the Christmas lights out to them,
they're usually staying with us for
another four or five years, right? Or
even like, let's say, three years. So we
end up making a lot more money on them
in the following years. And then if it
works out great, then a natural upsell
into it would be permanent lights. So
those are the lights that go in your
under jellyfish.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So it would be the permanent
lights that kind of go underneath your
gutters and stuff like that, right? And
so that's kind of the plan is okay, if
it works out great. Come next spring,
we're going to start the permanent
lights business. And then also, we have
a lot of females obviously that are
readers. That's our primary reader. And
I was like, man, if I go and start a
HVAC or roofing company or something,
you know, if someone's heat goes out,
they're not going to say, "Let me pull
up Winnipeg Digest and find the PL like,

[34:00]
up Winnipeg Digest and find the PL like,
you know, find the HVAC tech." So
Christmas night, it was great because I
feel like females are primarily the ones
making that decision. And that's exactly
what's happened as well. So we started
running some ads in the Winnipeg Digest
have already sold like five, six jobs
before the season has even started at
all before the main season kind of kicks
in. So
&gt;&gt; one piece of advice, take it or leave
it. I have a friend that has a Christmas
light roofing he has several different
successful big home service businesses
in Pennsylvania and he says like stay
away from permanent lighting. Stay away
from jellyfish. He says he only installs
it
&gt;&gt; if someone like demands it and he can't
have them as a customer any other way
because it's just a onetime thing. Yeah.
And then he's sometimes he has to go out
there and maintain it and fix it and he
just hates his life every time.
&gt;&gt; He he says if he could have it his way,
&gt;&gt; permanent lights were never installed
and he only does Christmas lights on the
leasing program every year. All right.
So when you put this ad in your own
newsletter for your other business, are
you calling it your other business? Are

[35:01]
you calling it your other business? Are
is it does it seem just like a third
party entirely?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, right now I mean we ended up doing
so what we did is we ran a giveaway. I
had heard it in some like Alexosi video
or something where he mentioned run a
giveaway, give one thing away and call
everybody else and say, "Hey, you get
$150 off for just entering the
giveaway." So did that. Got about 300
entries or something like that.
&gt;&gt; This is a giveaway for free Christmas
lights.
&gt;&gt; Exactly. Yeah. And then we called it
Lights the company. No website, nothing
like that at all. But when we do do the
branding for it, it's going to be the
same colors as Winnipeg Digest.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I love that. You're just leaning
into it, right? Like, you're supporting
the newsletter by
&gt;&gt; going through me for your Christmas
lights. You're probably going to go
through someone, go through me.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And then now what we're doing is,
you know, we can run offers that kind of
make it seem like they're exclusive for
the readers. So, we'll say something
like, "Hey, get your Christmas lights
done before October 7th and you get $150
off or something, right?"

[36:00]
off or something, right?"
&gt;&gt; The press point for us is our season
doesn't start until October 15th
anyways. So, anything that we do before
that is just extending our season more
and more.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Now, are you planning on like
running this? Like, are you outsourcing
it to another company? Tell me how the
operations of this looks. In an ideal
world, what I would like to do is kind
of have Winnipeg Digest as a marketing
arm for multiple businesses. So, let's
say I either acquire equity or I get
like given equity into businesses
whether that's 15 20% of course
depending on the size of the business
and we end up becoming like a fully
fractional CMO type of situation where
we they get access to Winnipeg Digest,
they get access to me, right? And then
we handle all their marketing for them,
right? and then in return we get some
sort of equity share in it. That's the
ideal world situation. But to go to a
business today and a local business
owner and say hey give me 15 20% of your
business
&gt;&gt; that's kind of they're not going to
believe in the fact that hey we can

[37:01]
believe in the fact that hey we can
actually deliver that value for them.
&gt;&gt; So that's why we started our own
business for now at least that's the
Christmas lights one where we're going
to run everything. So I did a my first
install yesterday and the
&gt;&gt; nice.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And so then the plus point about
this is I am learning obviously the
skill set of putting the Christmas
lights and stuff and then this is the
only company we'll ideally own and then
after this this kind of proves the model
that hey this works for home services
and then we're able to acquire equity
into other home services after this.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. Of all the businesses out
there what made you think Christmas
lights?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean it's biggest thing was it's
the season it seasonality right. So,
&gt;&gt; but most people look at that as a
negative, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. For me, it was, well, I have a
primary business, which is Winnipeg
Digest. I can I don't have to take away
too much time away from this. It's just
10 weeks. I give 10 weeks. If it works
out great, amazing. I double down. If it
doesn't, then I'm just going to forget
about it like it never existed. And

[38:01]
about it like it never existed. And
there's no website or anything for it
yet. So,
&gt;&gt; Okay. I like that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. What are the unit economics of
these jobs? What's an average job size?
What are you going to take home per job?
I know it's varies from year to year.
There's higher costs on year one. Can
you break all that down?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I mean this is just our obviously
first year doing it. We've booked five
job the last week. About $1,400 is our
average job right now.
&gt;&gt; Cost of doing that job for us is most
likely going to be like $200 $300. But
like the thing is the thing is we're
actually doing the labor right now
ourselves, right? So it's owner
operated. So that pricing takes into
account um in the future when we do end
up hiring labor and everything like
that. And then following years I think
on average the average is about 85% for
the amount of uh customers that stay on
year-over-year.
&gt;&gt; Wow. Okay. So the two to 300 that
includes the lights or just labor?
&gt;&gt; No three it's about $300. $300 is it
just includes the lights.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So your labor you're not like

[39:00]
&gt;&gt; Okay. So your labor you're not like
counting your labor as a cost. All I
heard is, you know, $6,000 of net
profit, you know, for on five jobs.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So, right, it's it's fairly
high, at least right now. And then
&gt;&gt; they take about fourish hours to do,
three, four hours to do, which is not
terrible for the first year. Second
year, we've already cut and cut the
lights for them and already have the
bulbs pre-crewed. So, it's like, you
know, that kind of time gets cut into
half.
&gt;&gt; What are you going to have to pay in
labor to have that 4hour job done once
you do start hiring people? Yeah, I mean
it'll be just minimum wage. It won't be
crazy.
&gt;&gt; $100 in labor per job, give or take.
&gt;&gt; It's about $15 an hour, you know, give
or take, let's just say, you know, three
people doing a job, right? Should take
three hours. So, yeah, like give or take
150 bucks.
&gt;&gt; Wow. Okay. Let's say year two, you you
stop doing it yourself. You hire it all
out. You basically you don't have the
COGS, the cost of goods sold, the hard
cost anymore. Now you have the labor
cost, but it's half as much. So if you
have call it 80% margins year one even

[40:01]
have call it 80% margins year one even
if you outsource all the labor year two
plus you have 90% margins.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. My goal is not to run the business
myself for sure. I will definitely be
bringing in an operator where I can get
them to like best equity or something
over a few years. Of course that'll be a
whole new world of problems but it'll be
fun. You know I think I think it'll be
fun where you know I don't want to run
the Christmas lights business at the end
of the day.
&gt;&gt; Right. But I say this all the time, like
it's important that people get to know
the weeds before they outsource, you
know, these core competencies and get
out of the weeds. Like,
&gt;&gt; yeah,
&gt;&gt; people are like, "Oh, I I heard a guy on
the internet say I I I need
outsourcings. This isn't this is I'm
above this. I'm No, you you got to know
exactly what those weeds look like until
you're ready to get out of them."
&gt;&gt; Exactly. Which is why I decided to do
the jobs myself this first year. Easily.
I could have like hired someone just
using the cash flow from Winnipeg
Digest. Like it wouldn't be too
difficult. It's just that down the road,
I don't want someone saying that it took
seven hours when it should have taken
three.
&gt;&gt; Like, bro, I've been on that ladder. I

[41:01]
&gt;&gt; Like, bro, I've been on that ladder. I
know what you're doing.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, that's why that's the simple
reason why I was like, you know what,
first year it's 10 weeks. I just won't
have a life for 10 weeks. That's totally
fine.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. How many jobs do you think
you'll do this year based on what your
conversion rates are looking like?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, we sucked at
sales for the first like seven, eight
quotes that we gave out and then now
we've started converting like I think in
the last like six jobs we have like
we've converted four of them or in the
last six quotes we've converted four of
them. I think I am very safely saying
that we'll hit $100,000 in revenue in
the first year.
&gt;&gt; Jeez.
&gt;&gt; I think so. At least that's not good.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; How did you get better at sales? How did
you suck before versus what you're doing
today?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, we would just go
in before and try and close them on the
like at the door, you know, and we would
have a pre like we would book an
appointment like a design consult and
they would come out and we would
literally just try and close them there.
And uh I didn't realize that, okay,

[42:00]
And uh I didn't realize that, okay,
that's what we shouldn't do. So, then I
prompted some a friend of mine who did
who did painting. So, he did doortodoor
painting, like student painting or
something like that. And so he's like,
"Yo, if you have a design consult
booked, you're going to go inside their
home, sit with them, showcase them the
mockup before and after, walk them
through your booklet, and then you're
going to price anchor them to this
price, right?" Like just the whole whole
shebang, right? And so that's kind of
what we've started doing now where we go
in and we have the quoted like $3,000 or
something that includes all the trees
and the home and the side of the home
and we slowly go with them and take out
everything and it gets to like $1,500.
And then I'm like, "Okay, if you book
before October 7th, you get a $150
discount today, right now,
&gt;&gt; right?" And so that's what we've started
doing now.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And you're closing like 60 70% of
that.
&gt;&gt; That's the number that we'll end up at
after the season. Like 60 70%. Now,
please tell me you're asking for
referrals.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, what
&gt;&gt; neighbor neighbors names?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, what we're doing is um there

[43:01]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, what we're doing is um there
is a Christmas lights person on Twitter.
He always says this. So, it's like a
$100 gift card or something to a
steakhouse or something along those
lines. So, we're now starting to offer
those. Right now, we're just getting all
of our stuff still printed. Like, it's
way early in the season. Most people
start advertising for this like
September 15th. So, we're way too early
anyways.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah,
&gt;&gt; like the homes that we have done, we
haven't asked directly for referrals
yet, but we will when we finish the job.
&gt;&gt; Quick question. What if there were a
private community out there of people
that were building businesses based on
this podcast? Well, I just made it and
it's only for business starters and
business builders. It's called TK Owners
and it's basically like having me and
100 other business geniuses as your
business partner. Also, there's going to
be exclusive new trends, growth hacks,
business ideas, and a database of
everything I've ever talked about.

Your conversion rate will only get

[44:01]
Your conversion rate will only get
better through September, October,
November even, right? So, whatever it is
today will get orders of magnitude
better.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And these are all but these are
like there's pros and cons because all
these are leads coming through Winnipeg
Digest currently. So, they're kind of
warm leads already. If we start
exploring Facebook ads and stuff, those
leads are going to be a lot more colder.
So, our conversion rate should drop
there a little bit.
&gt;&gt; Are you gonna do other stuff like that?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You're not just going to rely on your
newsletter?
&gt;&gt; We're going to do everything. Yeah,
we're trying to Okay.
&gt;&gt; $100,000 is like what do we want to do
base level over the weeks? If we're able
to do
&gt;&gt; 150200, that would be like ideal world.
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; It blows my mind that you're going to
come close to doubling your revenue by
adding Christmas lights to a newsletter.
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Like, who would have thought of that?
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Ryan Snett added luxury wedding bathroom
trailers to his newsletter.
&gt;&gt; And like that became a big business,
right? Cuz events. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Right. Events. That's what you said,
too.
&gt;&gt; I already know that you're thinking of
the spring and the summer. What other
kind of seasonal andor other businesses
are you thinking for this?

[45:01]
are you thinking for this?
&gt;&gt; I know that like very n like a lot of
people do the whole gutter cleaning,
window cleaning thing in the summer and
I don't want to get into the whole door
hassle of it. Honestly, I am not a great
salesperson training guy and I might be
able to become one, but I'm not that
right now. My bread and butter is like
marketing where I do Facebook ads and
things of that nature. So, I want to
explore businesses which I can utilize
that in, you know, and so most likely
that's why permanent lights was a
natural cell. Also, because a lot of
Christmas light owners, what ends up
happening is they'll say, "Hey, we're
actually 50/50 on whether we want
Christmas lights or not, right? because
we're considering permanent lights and
the permanent lights average order value
is about four to 5x whatever Christmas
lights is obviously LTV no but uh just a
one-time cost. So what we're able to do
is bring in someone for Christmas lights
so let's say first season we make some
money on them and then say okay if you
do permanent lights with us the
following year you get $500 discount.

[46:01]
following year you get $500 discount.
So, we're basically just pre-selling
customers for permanent lights during
the Christmas light season, right? And
um rather than making that money over
three years, we're just going to make
that money over two years because
they're going to do first season of
Christmas lights, then they're going to
do permanent lights the following
season.
&gt;&gt; Smart. I should have asked this earlier,
but what what has your timeline look
like with your newsletter and like
subscriber growth? When did you launch?
How many subs did you add those first
few months to today? Yeah, I mean in the
beginning we were adding like 4,000ish
subs a month. Four 5,000 actually. Now
it's decreased to like 2ishk give or
take where, you know, we're still
spending the same amount of money. So
it's about $3,000. But then yeah, you
start like saturating your market and
things like that. So now pretty soon I
think like it might be time where I just
turn off ads and try and spend that
money on referrals or something. So, if
we can do whether that's giveaways or
lead magnets or something like that for
referrals and just try and get more
subscribers that way, I think that might

[47:00]
subscribers that way, I think that might
be the next thing we're trying to go
into.
&gt;&gt; So, how many months to get to 35,000?
&gt;&gt; It's been Yes, we started in April,
whatever that is. I think like 17 months
or something like that. 16 17.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's amazing. At this time, no
plans to launch other local newsletters.
You want to keep growing this way.
&gt;&gt; I've had a lot of interest from other
cities for sure. Um, just because I talk
about local newsletters on Twitter and
I've kind of and obviously I've been on
your pod and Nick's pod and stuff. So,
I've had a lot of interest of people
saying, "Hey, can we franchise this out
or something like that?"
&gt;&gt; It's just that I know my dollars will be
much better spent trying to vertically
integrate this currently, right? Like,
so Christmas lights took $10,000 of
initial capital to start.
&gt;&gt; If I started another location instead of
Christmas lights, Christmas lights, I
might do $100,000 in 10 weeks. the new
location would have taken me 20 $30,000
to then on sponsors make like 50 $60,000
the first year and then once I'm able to
prove out a money model at least in my
city. So let's say if I know okay I'm

[48:00]
city. So let's say if I know okay I'm
going to on average make $200,000 from
just the newsletter and then another two
to 500,000 from Christmas sites. I might
not even explore other businesses after
that. It might just be okay.
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; that's the business model.
&gt;&gt; I'm going to go to other cities and
start
&gt;&gt; there's a cash cow. Yeah. Start the
media company based on the media
company, start Christmas lights. That's
it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Do you feel confident that you
could as of today with what you know
now, pick another city, not move there,
not know really anything about it, and
have just as much success?
&gt;&gt; 100%. I could. Yeah. Like once you've
been in the space for over a year, year
and a half. And I think for me the USP
is the unique selling point would be the
social media aspect of things. So social
media, if anyone is going to start this,
&gt;&gt; don't forget about social media because
at this point I'm a top three followed
let's say account in my city, right? If
I reach out to an account or a business,
they're almost obligated to reply to me.
So it makes my cold outreach so much
easier and the reply rate just

[49:02]
easier and the reply rate just
skyrockets rather than me emailing them.
So if you're going to go down this
route, also social media is a great way
to upsell your current sponsors into
saying, "Hey, I have two different
channels that you can reach." Yep.
&gt;&gt; Right. So that's the unique selling
point if you are going to start one.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, dude. You you got to reach out to
local businesses that collect emails and
say, "Hey, I'll I'll do a I'll give you
a free ad in exchange for your list.
Like, let me share your list."
Basically, right? Because they're
probably not using it. Most companies
that collect emails, they just sit
there. They don't do because it it takes
work. Yeah,
&gt;&gt; right. To regularly work your list. So,
a lot of them are going to be dead, but
you could say, "I'm going to run them
through a verifier and you could either
pay them, you know, 10 cents per email
or just say, I'll give you $2,000 worth
of ads for your 20,000 person list." And
they have no idea what it's worth.
&gt;&gt; Like, would you just add them to your
list? Like, rather than, I guess,
sending an email saying, "Hey,
subscribe."
&gt;&gt; I would just feel feel it out. Yeah.
Like, try multiple angles. Like, segment

[50:00]
Like, try multiple angles. Like, segment
the list and let's say it's 20,000. You
take four groups of 5,000 to one. You
just say, "Hey, you know, I partnered
with Mike's Bakery and uh I would really
love you to check out my local
newsletter." 5,000. You just kind of
work them into your list. Segment them
differently so you could track them,
make sure they're cleaned and scrubbed,
how many are opening. Oh, it's not bad.
Okay. And then the other two 10,000 try
different kind of creative things.
&gt;&gt; It's a time game, right? Like I love B.
Um, this is obviously my first or second
business, but I've heard a lot that
businesses that are just a time game are
the best businesses to be in because as
long as I'm just in this business and my
list keeps growing, it's essentially a
business that can't lose. It's an
audience that I can not only monetize
through ads, but then I can run my own
businesses on it. So, it's just a time
business. As long the longer I'm in the
business, the more money I'm going to
make.
&gt;&gt; Oh, man. I just kind of had a thought
where it's like every aspiring
entrepreneur or entrepreneur or
entrepreneur business owner whatever
they know that having an audience is
powerful but 95% of them have no desire

[51:04]
powerful but 95% of them have no desire
to get in front of the camera and to do
all that stuff because it sucks and it's
hard and I've been there right so they
don't even consider it. They're like I
know having an audience is valuable but
not for me.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I feel like this is a great
loophole into that, right? Where you can
just through the power of the written
word through Claude, through Chad GBT,
through a virtual agent or a virtual
assistant, you can use emails to build
an audience without having to get in
front of the camera. But you can still
have all that power. Like it's like
35,000 people in a city is more powerful
than a million Tik Tok followers that
are worldwide. It is.
&gt;&gt; I joke around with some of my friends.
I'm like, if I wanted to in three years
I could run for mayor, right? Like if
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I could have enough pole in the
city to be able to run for mayor, right?
But yeah, I think I completely agree
with what you said because the biggest
problem people run into when looking to
make content is what do I talk about?
&gt;&gt; In this case, you already have what
you're going to talk about because

[52:00]
you're going to talk about because
things are happening in your local town.
&gt;&gt; Fresh content every day.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly. And this is a business at
the very base level. The writing and all
that stuff can be given out to one or
two VAS and they can handle 90% of the
business for you. And all you really
have to do is deal with sponsorships if
you're not even able to you know give
that out. If you want if you are able to
also delegate that then good on you you
know. So it's not a business where you
need 40 hours a week. In the beginning,
I was spending 40 hours a week to write
and also do sponsorships, but as you
continue to grow, you can easily run
this whole business on 15 hours a week.
&gt;&gt; I just feel like this, you know, under
an hour video is probably about as
tactical and specific as you could get
on the internet for launching a local
newsletter.
&gt;&gt; I 100% agree. And honestly, if anyone is
going to refer one, they can reach out
to like the local newsletter community
is fairly friendly and you can reach out
to anyone and and other than that, just
go to Facebook ads library, search up

[53:02]
go to Facebook ads library, search up
any local newsletter. You can search up
my local newsletter, Winnipeg Digest.
&gt;&gt; And what's the 8020 of your best
performing ads? Video, Instagram,
Facebook, 15-second. It's simply at the
top. Usually have some sort of a local
monument as the background. Video or
image. Test both. I would say video has
done better for me. Some sort of a drone
footage of a local monument. Then um at
the top it says struggling to find
things to do in blank city, right? So
let's say struggling to find things to
do in Winnipeg. underneath it say
Winnipeg Digest or blank newsletter
sends you 50 plus events happening in
the city every single week. That's it.
That is
&gt;&gt; the best performing ads that you will
probably find.
&gt;&gt; One thing I love about this business is
how like let's say you're once a week,
you can start there. It's very
palatable. You do it yourself. You sell
out your ads. The easiest lever to pull
is now twice a week. Cool. I just
doubled my revenue. Three times a week,

[54:00]
doubled my revenue. Three times a week,
tripled it. Four, five, why not seven?
Let's do seven. And if you're running
out of like current events, you just do
opinion pieces.
&gt;&gt; And if you live in New York or
something, like a really large city, and
you don't know how to split things up,
you can also like almost niche down
twice. So you're already niche down
geographically.
&gt;&gt; And then you can do dads in New York.
You can do
&gt;&gt; you can do a freelancers in New York.
Yeah. Like freelance New York because
each of those audiences is going to be a
million people on its own if not more
&gt;&gt; in larger cities. So, let's say if I
lived in Austin, I would have just done
something like
&gt;&gt; um Young Dads in Austin or something
like that alone is probably like,000
people.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, I'd be so bold as to say
you'd be dumb to be in New York and just
do a New York local newsletter. Like,
you're just nothing to no one in that
sense, right?
&gt;&gt; Exactly. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Like you you could do like a
Williamsburg moms. Yeah. Like pick a
neighborhood, pick a Yeah. demographic.
&gt;&gt; 100%. and just and the higher obviously
and your your audience the more the more

[55:02]
and your your audience the more the more
expensive sponsors you can sell right
that's the biggest thing only downside
to new newsletters I will say is you
might run out of sponsors eventually you
know um if you keep promoting a great
result yeah okay you're obviously always
going to have those core sponsors so
you'll have a$150 $200,000 worth of
revenue coming in but if that's your
goal ahead start one but you should
probably look at ways to monetize on top
of the newsletter eventually.
&gt;&gt; Oh, Jazz, this was great. Where can we
look for you if we have questions?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Um, Twitter handle is creating
jazz. So, feel free to reach out if you
guys have any questions and happy to
chat with whoever wants to jam on some
local newsletter ideas.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And for the 14 listeners in
Winnipeg, Canada, go check out the
Winnipeg Digest.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And uh, reach out to me and maybe
we can grab coffee.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Thanks, Jez.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you.
&gt;&gt; All right. What you think? Please share
it with a friend and we'll see you next
time on the Kerner
