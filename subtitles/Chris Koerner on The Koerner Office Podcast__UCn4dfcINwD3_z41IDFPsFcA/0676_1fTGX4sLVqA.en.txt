trip Adviser Care.com Happyc hundreds of
directories making multiple millions and many more
making over six figures That one backlink that
got me to rank one has resulted in 2 years worth
of like completely passively $2,300 to $3,000
a month It's just one of those businesses that
people don't even think of They've all interacted
with them but they don't see it as an opportunity
There's still so many untapped opportunities out
there where there's more demand than supply 100%
I think once you see it you can't unsee it So if
someone's starting from complete scratch where
should they [Music] start What is a directory
and why should you care Travel velocity.com
that's a directory billion-dollar business Dry ice
nearme.com that's also a directory It's a five-f
figureure business Why should you care Because
there are millions I'm not exaggerating millions
of opportunities out there to start a directory
website for almost no money It's just math There's
a simple template There's about three tools
you need You log into the tools You see where

[01:01]
there's more search demand than supply You build
a directory with WordPress or Web Flow And then
you wait for it to rank And then you profit And
you do that over and over and over again until
you have a portfolio of websites maybe five maybe
500 making you hundreds to thousands of dollars
a month passively Does passive income exist No Is
this as close as you get Yes Freychu is a guy that
I found on Twitter and all he does is talk about
directories and he builds directories and he tells
people how to build directories He has nothing to
sell you He just wants to talk about what he does
in his free time So thrifting directories balloon
animal directories dog park directories Yes yes
yes All the above Anyone with about 100 bucks can
start a directory and learn and hopefully profit
when and or if they start ranking So enjoy this
interview share it with a friend and we'll see you
next time on the Kerner office You shut down your
business You were bummed out You had to flip items
at garage sales to make rent That sucked That
got you thinking creatively because constraints
equal creativity You just started looking online
passive income websites how to make money what's

[02:04]
scalable You came across directories You thought
"Okay if this isn't the thing then this could
be the thing that helps me learn SEO to do other
things." You started your first directory Months
later you found out it worked What was that
directory like do you mind telling us what the
actual website was and what made you choose that
niche Yeah I'm happy to share as much as possible
without giving the domain just because the first
time I did that it invited like three copycats
within 24 hours And yeah it's it's just one of
those things but it's in the thrifting niche
And I really just found it scrolling on Tik Tok
actually I noticed these viral videos of people
showing their thrifting hauls like a lot of Gen
Z They had millions of views and all the comments
were like location-based queries They were like
"Where is this Is there one in Pennsylvania?" You
know people were very curious and I was like
"Why aren't people just going to Google Maps
looking this up and then visiting it nearby?"
And that's when I discovered that there was a

[03:04]
bottleneck Like Google Maps was not very good at
very specific location-based queries If you typed
in the keyword that I built this directory around
it pulled up like a bunch of irrelevant businesses
and locations So yeah I researched it I saw one
website that did cover it and it was getting a
100,000 monthly visitors and I was like I could do
better than this I could I could I could improve
on this So I did combine some of the stuff I
learned from from YouTube and that's kind of
how I landed it Did you use Similar Web to look at
their traffic I use Hrefs Hrefs is always my go-to
Oh you look use that for traffic as well Mhm Yep
All right So and then you use AHFS I imagine to to
find the demand And you're I'm guessing you're
looking at keyword difficulty as in difficulty
to rank highly for it on Google and keyword volume
and you're looking for asymmetric bets there right

[04:00]
Yep Exactly You always want to find the balance
between something that's low keyword difficulty
with high search volume And then there's some
deeper stuff like sometimes keyword difficulty
is not the best metric to really uncover the
competitiveness of a niche but it's good enough
at a top level And yeah that's essentially what
I did also always find a bounty So like finding
a website that already succeeded that looks like
kind of a mom and pop publisher That was really
really nice to see You call that a bounty like a
template basically I call it someone that's gone
before you Yes Yes So someone that's come before
me that's successful that's not like a Forbes
looking like website So I know it's like viable
And I call it a bounty because SEO is a PVP game
Like I don't know if you played video games
but like not everyone can rank on the top 10
So you're gonna have to be okay taking them over
and completely dominating them And so that's why
I call it a bounty And it's it's a good sign It's
a green flag in my eyes when you're looking for
directory ideas A lot of the times you don't need
to take them over Like you can be second or fifth

[05:04]
and still do really well 100% Oh 100% There's so
many niches where people are like "Oh like can't
win in that." Well actually like the food niche
is a great example If you look under the hood of
any like like I think food near me is searched 13
million times a month or something like that and
there's so many directories that are winning in
that space because they're specializing in like
only food trucks that do Mexican food for example
and they just have a directory around that So yeah
100% What's a good example of a food directory
that you know is just crushing it There's a
couple that come to mind There's one for food
trucks I think it might be like foodtruck.com
I would have to double check but the other one
that came to mind was Happy Cow That's a really
famous directory I've heard of it's for vegan
vegan restaurants and vegan food And my f like
I have a lot of friends and family who are vegan
So that has just become such a sign of trust Like

[06:03]
when you go to a restaurant and you see the Happy
Cow badge you're immediately like you trust that
restaurant So it's definitely grown to something
really impressive And that's a good example of
like a food niche that's crushing it So Happy
Cow just started as a directory and now they're
kind of a vegan authority then They're almost like
the Trip Advisor but for finding vegan restaurants
Interesting Okay I think what people often find
when they go down this rabbit hole I found this
myself I'll get an Ahf's account and it's not
cheap It's like 150 bucks a month and it's like
"Okay I'm going to get the most out of this for
30 days because I'm probably going to churn."
And then I go in there and I start digging around
and I I'm like "Oh my gosh this one's good Oh this
one's good Oh this one's good." Is it just me or
there's still like so many untapped opportunities
out there where there's more demand than supply
100% I think once you see it you can't unsee it
And like if you just think like where's the last
place you and your friends or you and a partner

[07:03]
went that that you were really excited about Or
another framework I like to use is think about
the most meaningful or impactful like things that
happen in your life Graduations you know getting
into a relationship or getting married finding a
new job moving to a new city like a lot of those
can stir up new ideas for directories and they're
everywhere A personal example is I'm I'm actually
in the process of moving right now So I've been
obsessed with like water quality and looking up
like gravity filters and like stainless steel
dispensers and everything Yeah Everything So
I've been finding myself on these directories
that help me understand what the like best way
to find water quality is And something that
niche can be a directory So it's like yeah
there's there's so many untapped opportunities
Okay So how many directory sites do you own today
So I own six but technically like I've spoken
about this recently in my community where you know

[08:03]
I I have six but I've really only put like full A
through Z effort in three of them Like I'm talking
keyword research like organizing the data properly
building out the website doing the SEO monetizing
it like everything Luckily I've been three for
three in that sense They're all cash flowing and
profitable and ranking So I think two are like
basically dominating the first page of Google
The other one is in a very high competition niche
It's in plasma donation Yeah it's a little smaller
one It gets around 6,000 monthly visitors but that
one's interesting too What was the signal that you
saw that made you want to launch one in that niche
even though you knew there was high competition I
think it's because my first directory was B TOC
So I wanted to try a B2B one and I wanted to try
a different way to monetize So the original game
plan with the plasma donation one was okay like
let's go B2B and let's let me try to get this $300
million revenue a year plasma company to like pay

[09:02]
me thousands of dollars to either promote their
business And that didn't really end up working
as planned cuz the market for plasma donation I
learned is very small There's like eight plasma
companies that might be able to buy your sponsored
listings But yeah it was like a combination of
a challenge because I felt pretty confident and
even though it was really high keyword difficulty
like it was like in the 70s or 80s there was a
lot of search volume and there were definitely
like few competitors like it was competitive but
there were only like 10 or 15 competitors So the
quantity of competitors was small So I was like
okay well maybe there's room for for me to take
a little bit of this market share So what is your
monthly traffic across all your directory sites
The first one gets around like 60,000 monthly
visitors The second one's around like 8 to
10 kind of fluctuates And the last one six So
probably like it it ranges from like probably

[10:02]
70 to like 90,000 monthly visitors cuz yeah it
really fluctuates The the first directory at one
point was getting 85 90,000 monthly visitors So
it does fluctuate a good amount And it's like 100%
organic or 100% organic Yep That's really my main
distribution channel I only deal with organic and
I mainly deal with like passive evergreen niches
So that's kind of my favorite And what kind of
revenue do those three pull in combined It also
ranges but like completely passively it's probably
around like 2300 to $3,000 a month So nothing
crazy but with my specific like high standards way
of finding niches and building directories I think
you do give up some revenue like as opposed to if
I were to go with the sponsored listings route or
there's a lot of other ways to monetize where you
can have a much higher ceiling for much more work
right It's the trade-off between profitability and

[11:01]
work And you'd rather have multiple sites doing
500 to 5,000 each than a couple sites where you're
going out and like at a certain point you become
a sales business You're just finding sponsorships
and selling ads and that's a that's a grind And
one site could be a six-f figureure business
but it's it's a different lifestyle It's a
different strategy 100% You're essentially
a marketing agency at that point you're handling
clients and to put it in perspective like I don't
think I've touched any of the my websites for like
six months and they just continue to to bring that
in So that's my preference It's not everybody's
you know people who you can build a directory I
mean I think you know tripadvisor care.com happy
all there there's hundreds of directories making
multiple millions and many more making over six
figures in the 100 to 500k range I just want like
a very hands-off like I just want some lunch money
at the end of the day Yeah Yeah Okay Where is your

[12:01]
revenue coming from Is it affiliate links Is it
ads like AdSense or Mediavine So yeah right now
I'm on Mediavine and I'm on Mediavine Journey So
it's for Mediavine's main network is for websites
I think doing over 50 or 100,000 sessions which my
first directory qualifies for but it actually got
denied for some reason but I got into Mediaine
Journey I think it's depending on the type of
content But yes Mediavine Journey is my display ad
revenue And then I also sell digital products on
one of them It's just like a $19 PDF that I built
in Canva like a year and a half ago and it sells
like almost every day Wow Okay So plasma niche
thrifting niche What are the other kind of niches
One of them is like kind of adjacent to thrifting
and like you can think kind of liquidation stores
Maybe that's a better way to describe it I have
ones that are kind of halfbaked in the portaotti
rental space Flea markets I think that that's
the one I'm building out right now And then I

[13:04]
do have a dog parks directory that I built that's
really underoptimized that I need to tweak a lot
But yeah Sniff Spot right Sniff Spotspot is Yeah
that's not my directory No I know I But similar
similar They're kind of like an Uber for you know
backyard dog parks but they're broadening the
market for people like you to come in and pick up
the leftover traffic Yep Yep Sniff Spotspot does
like private dog park rentals Mhm I kind of just
created a directory for all the public free dog
parks just to give people some more options and a
easier way to navigate those I would love if you
could share your screen go to AHF's or I I can
I have a paid a AHFS account I could do the same
and like let's just kind of dig around and show
me what you look for what stands out to you Sure
let's do it And for anyone listening on audio
only I'll I'll be describing what we're seeing
So let's share this screen here So do you want to
kind of understand how I find ideas Are we looking

[14:05]
at a specific niche Maybe even Let's do both Let's
let's go inside your brain for a minute and see
how you find ideas and then we'll go from there
Okay So I think one that I talked about on like
pretty publicly is just typing in near me Okay
And the reason I do this is he's on the keywords
explorer part of ahrefs.com Yes So right now I'm
looking at the AHFs I just typed in near me in
the keyword explorer And this is just one way
to kind of you know find ideas in a very kind
of random and broad way And I basically don't look
at anything here I stay away from branded keywords
for the most part like Target near me McDonald's
near me Those aren't good directly What are you
going to do with that Yeah exactly Like people
have no problem finding McDonald's near me So I
usually just scroll all the way to like you know
sometimes the 10th page right So I'm just going

[15:00]
to keep on clicking down and we can see that of
course the volume every month is going down Show
us show us in the columns where the keyword
difficulty and the search volume are So right
there Yep So here's the keyword difficulty And you
can see it's a range between 0 to 100 Zero being
the easiest to rank for 100 being the hardest to
rank for And search volume is a number for monthly
search in the country that you're filtering
for in the United States Okay So yeah like
I'll just scroll down this list There's so many
random ideas because it's by default showing us
the keywords that have the most search volume and
I'll look for green right Green indicates that the
keyword difficulty is lower So interesting Dubai
chocolate bar near me Zero keyword difficulty
82,000 searches So if I'm you I'm seeing wow like
on the surface that's amazing Zero and 82,000 But
then because of the fact I just posted content
about this this is probably a viral Tik Tok trend

[16:03]
And I don't know if this is going to be around in
two years so I'm going to pass Is that what you
would say I think that's very valid I also think
of anything product based you're going up against
e-commerce stores Yeah You know if you're looking
to buy chocolate Yeah Those are going to dominate
the search engine results page So it's not really
like it doesn't make sense for people to go to a
directory to find Dubai chocolate Yeah I did see
towing If you can scroll up back up towing near
me was like a 26 Mhm Yeah 26 difficulty and 84,000
What do you think about that one Towing is not bad
I think that it seems too broad for me and I would
be curious to see something like emergency towing
maybe you know overnight towing or something
really really specific So in that case why is that
Just because this is lacking the like to me it's
not clear what the search intent is right Like

[17:01]
okay you're towing near me Are you probably like
infer that people are looking to tow a car near
me But do they need their car towed Has their car
already been towed Are they looking for an impound
lot Exactly You're going to get lower volume on
emergency towing near me but you're going to get
lower competition and it's probably a higher like
cost per click It's a higher ticket item because
it's higher intent right 100% And so actually
that's a good example because I might even see
that and I'm like well let me look into it deeper
So I'll look up the keyword explorer and I'll
just type in towing and then I'll go to matching
terms And one thing I'll do is I'll also sort in
hrefs by keyword difficulty So I can say I don't
want to see anything above a keyword difficulty
20 which I think is generally a good rule Is that
kind of your your rough barometer Very rough It's
not a hard rule Generally speaking yeah it's
it's a rough rough estimate for what's lower

[18:00]
competition to rank for So video is cool but you
know what's better Long form audio via podcast and
my newsletter tkopod.com Go there to subscribe for
free to my newsletter It's one email a week very
tactical And then go to my audio podcast Three
episodes a week stuff like this You're going to
love it All free No sleazy sales pitch tkopod.com
So this is interesting There's lizard liquid
towing So there's like this is interesting because
sometimes you can build a successful directory
just leveraging the search volume and reputation
of other businesses right Maybe they're famous
So if you if you were to build a directory and
mentioned lizard towing then you might be able
to get a little bit of traffic from that you know
and that starts to add up if you were to create a
nationwide directory Cheap towing kind of gives
us a little bit clearer of intent of what people
are looking for There's interesting keywords
around specific like Tacoma towing capacity
Towing capacity Yeah But essentially I would
look through this and I'd ask myself you know

[19:05]
what longtail keywords exist in the towing niche
that might be worth it Nothing I'm seeing too much
A lot of this it seems like towing capacity
is actually a very commonly searched query So
maybe I'm thinking okay is there opportunity to
make a directory around just towing capacity for
different trucks or different types of vehicles
Because look at this There's literally zero
keyword difficulty for toy to Toyota 400 towing
capacity gets searched 4,000 times a month and
that trend continues throughout tons If you add up
all those all that search volume across thousands
of makes and models it's a lot of traffic starts
to add up And I do kind of take a look at this
too SV at the very top says 2 million So this
is saying that of all the keywords that contain
the the keyword towing and that's under a keyword
difficulty of 20 there's 2 million people a month

[20:01]
or two million searches a month being being made
So that's a lot Even if you get 20,000 of that
you know 30,000 now you're scratching the surface
of what could be like a $1,000 a month directory
Well and you look on the left side the the most
commonly appearing word in towing is capacity
They're not looking for to get their car car
towed at all which perfectly proves your point
It was too broad of a keyword Exactly Yeah that's
a great observation And I didn't even know that
Like this is I think we stumbled upon like lowkey
a pretty interesting directory niche Look at that
Someone listening towing capacity website Yeah I
guess like one thing I would be concerned with is
if this is a you know likeformational content
I think we've seen in the last few years with
the Google core updates are pretty vulnerable
to AI So that's like one angle that I might be

[21:00]
a little bit concerned about But just I would
research it and try to understand where people
are getting this information If if I look it
up on Reddit you know if I copy and paste this
and type Reddit and there's a lot of people
asking like this person a year ago as Tacoma
towing capacity question mark as 20 comments
20 plus comments how much can you tow in your
Tacoma Like these are good signs that people
are looking elsewhere Like people may not be
satisfied with the AI overview or going to chat
GBT So what a what a great framework in general
of if you see something appearing over and over on
Reddit it's probably because they're not getting
what they need on Google which probably means that
something needs to be on Google that answers that
question because we'd all prefer to go to Google
first right 100% Yeah And just to add on to that
like I'm sure there's nuance Like I don't really
tow anything so I don't know anything about this
niche but I would be willing to bet if we spent
like two hours going through every single Reddit

[22:01]
thread there would be nuances to why people are
asking this question Like it's not that's not as
simple as seeing like you know Subaru Outbacks
can pull 7,000 pounds And so that's your answer
It's like there's probably some nuance within
this niche that you can use and make your
directory more valuable All right I didn't want
to derail you from what you're doing on the near
me page Yes If you want to go back to that Yeah
So essentially I This is a good starting point
This is a good starting point And what I just
showed you is really what I do whenever I find
something interesting And truthfully I would never
have researched towing near me So like but you it
was interesting to you and and I think that's
where a lot of the opportunity lies Like what
I think is easy to rank and and the vision that
I see for my directory is very different than
than literally anyone else So yeah I'll just keep
scrolling down I find a lot of promise in keywords
that hover around like 15,000 monthly search
volume to like 60,000 I think I found the most

[23:05]
opportunity in that range Not a hard rule but just
mentioning just observations Batting cages that
looks I coincidentally I have a friend that lives
across the street that just opened a batting cage
and they are thriving Really Okay Great So yeah
So that's that is interesting And right off the
bat my mind goes to affiliate plays people I used
to go to the batting cages all the time I played
baseball for the first 14 years of my life and
we'd go and sometimes you forget your bat and like
it's just like there's opportunity there where
you can you know yeah sell something related a
glove a bag whatever it is So that's another angle
Whenever I'm going through this I don't just look
at the keyword difficulty or the search volume I'm
thinking about what the monetization potential is
here How passive is this You know according to my
standards if I want something really passive and
evergreen batting cages might be a decent move
because the chances are batting cages aren't

[24:04]
going to change in the next 20 years very much
It's just going to be a metal cage and a a ball
that dispenses at a high speed and and that's it
You just It's very simple So that might be worth
researching more for someone like me What are some
other like overarching trends similar to near me
like other ways that I find ideas Yeah That
you could use to start your search For sure
Yeah that's a good point I like to research
successful directories that are already getting
a lot of traffic and I like to kind of snipe their
keywords and get some ideas there So so I do have
another way to find ideas but I do want to show
you a few different directories first And what
I'd like you to do is just guess the traffic and
then we can go into how I find ideas from these
successful directories So if that sounds good
then I will show you the first directory here

[25:02]
Drag it around here Okay I have a story about this
actually for those listening He's on penguin dry
ice.com And it is so funny you brought this up
because I ownund and something domain names and
you know a lot of them are stupid but I used to
own a third party logistics company that we we
helped food brands ship their food and we were
getting dry ice on a regular basis and there was
no directory of dry ice We'd have to go to Kroger
or Albertson's and buy it and you didn't know the
cost or whatever and so I bought the domain name
dollarry ice.com to be like a directory of dry
ice facility So here you are showing me penguin
dry ice.com which seems to be a dry ice directory
Mhm Yep And yeah just like you It's a very ugly
website Very ugly website A single page website
So the directory just lives on this page There's
Wow Not a lot of detail It just sort of says the
name the address the proximity how far it is But
if I'm like buying dry ice like for example my

[26:05]
dad has a family business where he ships frozen
food across the country We're not looking for like
Albertsonsized dry ice We're looking to buy a lot
of dry ice Mhm B2B business There's not really any
clear data enrichment around Hillsboro New Jersey
dry ice on the quantity You know what about their
service I want to know so much more So based on
what you see how much traffic do you think this
directory is getting Oh man So if if I understand
this correctly Penguin is the company that sells
dry ice And this is just a directory of their
facilities that sell it So many of these are
probably just grocery stores I'm going to say 40
40,000 a month All right let's take a look I'll
head over to the site explorer So a little bit off
This is a small directory but it still shocked me
15,000 monthly visitors and from climbing
it's climbing and at its peak it was getting

[27:09]
an estimated on target of 83,000 monthly visits
back in October of 2024 So it does peak and I
would guess that maybe there's some seasonality
to this but you know pretty consistent you know
they've had some some of their LOLs but pretty
impressive for just a dry ice directory And they
don't have separate pages for all those which is
not optimized at all Right It depends It just kind
of depends how you structure your data But yeah
this is a single page website And you can see
that this single page ranks for a 100,000 keywords
Holy kind of crazy Dry Ice Boston Dry Ice D Like
yeah they're completely dominating the space and
I'm sure it does wonders for Penguin as a brand
So very niche though Like this is so niche and
they're This is believe it or not not the only dry

[28:02]
ice directory I found Otherwise they're smaller
but it's just proof that you can go that niche
and still win to some capacity Can you speak for
a second about authority because that's probably
why they're winning because like they're doing
the hard thing They sell dry ice It's relevant
Like Google wants us Google wants to show us
things that are relevant that have high trust and
have high authority And Penguin has all the all
those things right Yep How do you get around that
If you're not a Penguin and you want to build a
successful directory is it helpful to go in niches
that don't really have a high trust high authority
player Sure that's definitely one way to do it
Ultimately the game is back links You know I think
a lot of people whether they're in SEO or not they
know backlinks have been the main driver And so
to your point yeah Penguin is pretty authoritative
It's a 37 domain rating which is an indication
of how authoritative a website is but in my mind
like I think this is still viable to overtake And
the reason is one of the competing directories for

[29:05]
dry ice that I found it looks really bad and
I'll pull it up here It's this website right
here Oh okay For those listening one of the worst
websites I've ever seen in my life That's just all
I'll say It's really bad Holy cow Like 97 Yeah So
just just for a quick comparison right Like if we
just see because obviously this directory dry
ice directory.com Yes It gets a little bit less
traffic It has its moments as well but I actually
analyzed and did a side-by-side comparison between
these two websites and they're not too far off If
we look at the keywords it's ranking for let's see
this is dry ice near me There was I mean dry ice
near me now rank five They have some keywords on
the first page Penguin dry ice is more or less
like dry ice for for sale near me They're rank

[30:02]
they're position sixish So it's not like a massive
difference If I were Dry Ice Directory this ugly
website I think there's a world where you just
do a lot of link building and you can start to
slowly overtake Penguin Dry Ice But from what I
see it's like dry ice is pretty competitive right
Like would you enter that space based on what
you've seen If I'm okay with a directory that
just based on the volume that makes like maybe
tops $500 a month passively then yeah I would And
I've done that before I mean I could probably make
this in like a week and be a decent competitor I
would give it like a a B minus in terms of like
grades opportunity opportunities Yeah Just just
for me would you agree that people often put too
much weight in the appearance of a website Like
I'm over here making fun of this website and it's
it's objectively ugly but it works And if someone
goes through seven clicks to get to this website
and it has what they need they're not going to
click back and find a prettier website right So
like all else equal yes make a pretty website but

[31:05]
like these are winning because they're answering
questions not in spite of how their website looks
right Yeah Yeah I don't want people to listen to
this be like I'm going to go find an ugly website
and then compete with them It's like that's
like it I don't think it moves the needle all
that much in the grand scheme of things I would
agree I would agree I think people do put way
too big of an emphasis on design I think there's a
difference between having something really modern
and and and looking good and something that's
mobile optimized which is much more important
Like across all my directories I think it's like
80 to 82% of website visitors are on mobile So
yeah you can have a pretty website but if it's
not really easy to navigate on mobile then then
that's that's a really big missed opportunity
Yeah Did you want to show me a couple others
The next one one that I talked about recently and
it's called movie locations It's to help you find
the locations that certain movies and films were
were were shot Movie-loations.com is what we're

[32:05]
looking at Lot of ads going on is what I see very
cluttered More updated than the ones we've looked
at but still fairly outdated Movie films places
Yeah this is there's a lot going on here There
is It's hard to know where your eyes should look
but it's a very simple directory So I'm going to
think this is like movie theater locations This is
just like if you were curious where Harry Potter
was shot or if Lord of the Rings was shot in a
certain country or something like that Yeah Yeah
I mean this is huge TAM total addressable market
Like everyone's watching movies A lot of people
want to know I would think this is six figures
worth of monthly visitors over 100,000 Okay
let's take a look here I'll just grab this root
domain and let's take a look All right overshot

[33:00]
it a little bit but 81,000 monthly visitors
Wow And I think I was still surprised by that
I know there's a large addressable search market
for this niche but how many of the millions of
people who watch Fast and Furious actually care
to know where this was shot Like it's probably
got to be a very small percentage But this is a
great example of an evergreen niche because you
can always just keep this information It doesn't
go out of date And just look at this graph It's
so consistent Like it's just been like that for
the last 5 years So whoever whoever owns this is
making I would assume close to around $5,000
$6,000 passively a month maybe more because
they have a lot of ad placements And yeah walk
us through that math That's the question I was
going to ask you next anyway How do you convert
81,000 visitors a month to $5,000 a month Yeah So
it's really honestly difficult because it's not
arbitrary but it's very depend there's a lot of

[34:01]
variables So it depends on could be affiliate
could be AdSense could be Mediaviaine could be
e-commerce like so yeah that's that's exactly
one angle like how many monetization strategies
are there even if there's ads is it a private ad
partnership or not and then not only that it's
like nichebased gaming is a notoriously low RPM
niche if you're monetizing through display ads so
you might need like a million monthly visitors
for a gaming directory that earns the same as
a directory that gets 50,000 monthly visitors in
the finance niche or something along those lines
So it's very difficult and I always just use
what I get as far as RPMs in my thrifting niche
in my other niche directories because they're I
would say pretty in the middle of the road So you
know decent RPMs nothing insane but for me those
listening RPM is revenue per thousand views Yep
So it is an educated guess At the end of the day
it's very very difficult to say Not only that but

[35:04]
Hrefs is third party data So we can only kind of
take this 81,000 monthly visitors with a grain of
salt I know with Hrefs it shows my thrifting niche
to get like 35,000 monthly visitors and it's just
off by like 20 20 30,000 So they could be getting
more and so that makes it even harder Okay So but
what is like what is the RPM that you get on your
thrifting niche for example I think it's right
right around $16 or $17 ballpark That's good
And it fluctuates too Like sometimes it really
fluctuates So it's it's hard to say And I think it
scales based on how much traffic you get because
it gets more it's get it gets higher RPMs than my
healthcare directory which is not what you would
think but I think the more traffic you get maybe
it's the case that advertisers are willing to pay
more I'm not really sure how that works but yeah
it is interesting Outside of AHFs what other tools

[36:00]
are in your tool belt for building these sites and
for researching opportunity in these sites Yeah
for research it's really just a combination of
href's Google Maps reviews I look at these Google
Map review tags a lot which we can we can pull
up and Reddit I would say those and then Tik Tok
of course was kind of naturally one I feel like
people don't filter their true thoughts on Tik
Tok when they're leaving a comment which makes it
a great area to do some social listening And then
what do you use to build this your directories
It really depends but I guess WordPress has been
the chosen CMS for me in the last couple years
Right now I'm kind of diving deep into Lovable
and trying my hand at AI coding But yeah so I'll
use WordPress and it's funny like I use Elementor
Pro which is like the most basic theme I've used
that And yeah it's like a lot of people which
gets a lot of hate by the way People are like
"Oh it's slow and clunky." And I'm like "Yeah
but if you can build fast sometimes brute forcing
your way to an MVP is way better than trying to

[37:05]
automate everything and then like forgetting the
big picture of what you're doing which is like
consolidating valuable data on the internet
that people are looking for Do you use any
like thirdparty tools Not like a WordPress plugin
but stuff outside of WordPress to connect things
Sometimes I'll play with I've used Geodirectory
which is a dedicated directory plugin It's more
for programmatic builds So what I mean by that is
with a plugin like that you know if you have a a
directory that has 2,000 business locations it
would take forever to make to create those pages
individually So you can publish those all at once
because kind of it's it's built with a database
You can just fill out the information and you can
publish that So that's pretty good For other types
of directory builds I've used WPL import just to
bulk import my data and jet engine which helps
you filter the data Right If I'm looking for a
dog park specifically like a specific type of

[38:06]
dog park that offers like fenced in area for small
dogs only like you might want to create a specific
filter and that's how you can accomplish that
You can use that jet engine and build that out
How much weight do you give an exact match keyword
as the domain name It's a leg up for sure Like
exact match domain names are they're effective I
mean it's been proven I don't I think it might So
that would be like dry ice near me right I'm just
trying to explain to those listening what an exact
match domain name is Yeah like petcremation.com
would be in insane Like that'd be amazing You
don't need to mention near me in the actual domain
because any query that says near me like dog parks
near me It's like it's based on your location So
like you don't need to include that You can just
include the main keyword And you always want to go
for tldds if possible I like to choose.org or if

[39:02]
it's really if I'm out of options but I would
rather have a hyphen in my name and I choose
a.com than than just go straight to a.org But yeah
you want your your main keyword for sure Are you
using AI at all to build these or to do research
Directories is a multi-step process and AI is used
in multiple steps of that process In terms of
ideiation sometimes but I like to rely more on
user generated content because it more accurately
depicts what the challenges are in terms of like
finding dry ice right I'd much more I'd be more
interested in what people are saying But yeah AI
is definitely a very big part especially when
it comes to data enrichment You know you have
your idea How do you bring it to life How do you
make it an actually valuable directory people want
to visit Well you have to enrich the the hell out
of your directory You know you have to offer data

[40:01]
and information that's going to save people time
And if you had a horse that needed to be cremated
you might go to Google Maps and type in horse
cremation But what realistically might happen is
a lot of business profiles will will show up and
you'll have to spend a lot of time sifting through
the reviews maybe typing a keyword in review to
see if anyone's cremated a horse at this specific
cremation service It's it's timeconuming So AI is
used to essentially automate parts of that process
where you can essentially enrich your data I built
a enrichment tool called enrich.directory and it
essentially does that You can type in horse and
it'll look at all the cremation companies in the
in the United States and look for the keyword
horse and then you can prompt it and say can I
cremate a horse at this place and it'll say yes
So that's cool Yeah So long-winded way to say
yes AI is definitely used in in the process So if
someone's starting from complete scratch the only

[41:01]
thing they know about directories is hearing
this one podcast Where should they start and
how do they get from where they are today
to they have a website built ready to go A
lot of my recommendations and advice actually
has less to do with practical tactical advice
I think people who see directories think it's like
super simple which relative to other businesses
they are But I think what led me to succeeding
with my first three directory websites initially
it was just to learn SEO Like I think people
realize they have to believe that SEO works And
a lot of people I'm noticing are choosing the
wrong niches and they can't rank and then they
just give up They're discouraged They're like
"Oh this doesn't work Directories don't work."
So I guess my tactical recommendation is use
your unique personality and character your
life experiences the same way I did with the
thrift stores and try to come up with unique
and quirky niche directory ideas that probably no
one's building a directory in There's literally

[42:05]
thousands of opportunities There's thousands of
people looking for very specific information on
the internet and you can cater to those people So
that's kind of what I would recommend But start
in a low competition niche Don't go for something
broad like towing near me That's an intermediate
niche Intermediate to advanced You you need to
know the fundamentals of SEO and know need to
know what you're doing to succeed in that niche
So prove to yourself that it works Could you dive
deeper on that on why something like towing near
me is too advanced for a beginner Yeah it's part
of just me and my experience knowing that anything
service- based with a high with the opportunity to
make a lot of money right Like towing companies
is like I don't think you have to be a genius to
know that there's a lot of towing companies Why
is that Well people are making money towing cars
So there's naturally going to be more competition
which if you place all that knowledge in an SEO

[43:01]
environment you know that you're going to need a
lot of backlinks to rank for a directory website
or any website for that matter Yes it's the driver
of SEO but with that said you need high quality
backlinks It's not that easy for someone who's
just getting started right Requires a little bit
of creativity being crafty being knowledgeable
about all the ways you can acquire these back
links So in that sense intuitively I'm saying that
I think it's an intermediate niche What would be
a more beginner niche A beginner niche I would say
the dry ice if we're if we're staying on topic Dry
ice is a pretty low competition niche I mean it's
it's it's pretty pretty in there The thing is like
every competitive niche typically has some low
competition niche layered underneath Is there like
a generalized keyword difficulty or or search
volume that you'd look for on a more beginner
niche or is it just totally industry dependent
Keyword difficulty is is a big one I would look

[44:00]
at zero to five Like if we if we looked up the
near me method that I described and and you set
your keyword difficulty at a maximum of like five
or even three I'm sure you'd find some pretty low
competition stuff Backlinks could be a three-hour
long conversation But in your experience what's
the 8020 of getting good backlinks Like the the
growth hacky clever way in your experience Before
even thinking about the clever ways you have to
decide how black hat you want to be how if you're
okay crossing the lines of you know Google toos
and here's a secret that's not so secret Everyone
breaks the rules in SEO No one really plays fair
They do what works But if I'm just strictly saying
okay here are some ways that you can go get back
links One thing that's really worked well for me
is to look at a bounty right A existing directory
in your space use hrefs or a tool similar to hrefs

[45:00]
and look at their back links Reach out to those
people giving those back links to your competitor
and you can pay them You can leverage anything of
value that you have You can say "Hey my directory
gets 10,000 monthly clicks We're proud to be the
most accurate pet cremation directory online and
I saw that you linked to this this website Can I
pay you 50 bucks to swap out the link for ours You
know we we we think we do a better job Not just
to add mine but to swap it That's the key To swap
it And so you have this situation where now your
competitor loses a very good backlink You gain
that backlink without overpromising anything Like
it's literally taken me one strong backlink with
that exact method to rank one in a low competition
but high search volume niche which is kind of
bananas That is like one Now the domain authority
of the backlink is is everything right If you have
a backlink from CNN.com versus an a backlink
to Martha's Pet Cremation Facility Nashville

[46:03]
Tennessee.com it makes all the difference It makes
a big difference So like if I were to break down
what makes a high quality backlink it's definitely
like domain authority domain rating That's that's
a great indication But it's also how much traffic
is that referring page getting right If that CNN
page that's backlinking to your website if
it's getting zero visitors yes it's kind of
worth something But what would be way better is
if it was getting 500 monthly visitors and people
are scrolling the article then clicking on the
backlink landing on your directory Now Google's
like "Oh wow This is a highly relevant blog post
or article." And people are engaged Those user
signals are becoming increasingly important in
a world of AI spam So traffic for the referring
page is a biggie Link domains right So if that
CNN page is linking to a 100,000 websites it's
like there's not that much link equity or link
juice as people call it And a simple way to

[47:02]
think about that is like imagine trying to split
a birthday cake a 100,000 ways It's just not going
to you're going to get like a crumb So that's
kind of the same you know thing that happens
with with a backlink that's refer you know linking
to a bunch of pages So you want low link domains
Okay What about those many services that sell back
links 500 bucks a month for X number of backlinks
Do you put any stock in those I think it could
work You just have to be really careful I think a
lot of gray hat stuff going on there Oh black hat
Gray or black hat Yeah Like I feel like a lot of
those backlinks that you pay 500 or thousands of
dollars a month for very low quality I would for
the most part never just go on Google and type in
backlink services and choose the first one I think
that's kind of crazy Same with Fiverr backlinks
Like oh $5 for like a thousand back links Those
are spammy backlinks They may result in well first
of all they're not going to help Second of all

[48:00]
it might even get you penalized which could lead
to being de-indexed which is like the worst case
scenario Like your your website will not be able
to be searched on Google So it's just really risky
and you want to be very careful buying backlinks
is like I guess technically against Google to but
again no one really plays by the rules there So
you just have to be very yeah you have to trust
the backlink vendor If you don't trust them you
can always buy the backlink and then don't send
it to your direct site Send it to a you know an
article that backlinks to your website So you're
bumping up the backlink if that makes sense and
there's less risk there There's a lot that we can
talk about around backlinks The best way to get
back links in your opinion like let's say it's
a pet cremation site is I'm gonna go find like a
high domain authority a very relevant site in in
this case maybe about like end of life care for
pets and I'm going to reach out to them manually
because the harder way is often the better way
and say "Hey we provide a really good service

[49:04]
Would you would you mind linking to us If no then
like can I give you 50 bucks to link to us?" Like
that's the 8020 of it That works That's reliable
I think it's the best balance between what's like
in your control right You can aggressively
reach out to people and like yes it's out
of your control that you respond and accept the
offer but it's the balance between like highest
quality backlink speed and like being aggressive
with your link building and price That's because
if you were to buy the same quality backlink if
they knew what they were giving you it would be
500 bucks 1,000 bucks for that backlink Because
like I said that one backlink that got me to
rank one has resulted in like two years worth of
like $2,000 a month you know to $2,500 a month
revenue you know and I bought it for 50 bucks
So wow Which niche was that in That that's in
the thrift store niche Okay That's And I've tested
buying back links I've spent thousands of dollars
on different link building services and like I
can say that yeah this is the best bang for your

[50:06]
buck and for for quality any other like closing
best practices you'd like to leave people with
on just how to build a profitable directory Any
advice that you could give that would help them
save themselves a world of hurt that you you had
to go through Oh man there's a lot You know it's
funny because the best advice is oftentimes the
most cliche like just just build it Learn learn
while building right That's what I did I didn't
have a massive emphasis on making money from my
directory website As I mentioned it was more of
a playground to learn the skill It's very hard
because once you start building and you have a
successful directory you never know what's going
to follow Like you literally don't know if you're
end up you're going to end up like talking about
it and then people want to hire you and become
an SEO consultant and that's going to lead to
building an SEO agency like this is a very common
route and so I would say just like be convinced

[51:04]
yourself that SEO works Choose a low competition
niche Try to focus on the skill development not
just the monetization efforts because those will
come Once you have traffic it's like you have like
a dozen ways to monetize You get you can just
choose but you need to get traffic before that
And yeah it's a slow game Like that's a really
big one People are like I don't see any progress
two weeks after I launched my directory I'm like
"Dude show me one business in general where maybe
SAS but that's like with years of experience
where you can whip something up that quick and
it gets like a lot of organic traffic." Yeah
Like while you wait go build another one and
then another one and then next thing you know
it's going to be six months later you have 15
sites and seven of them are cranking Yep Yep A
numbers game Yeah So it's all the cliche stuff
you know It it it's true It's it's Yeah At the
end of the day it is true Well this was amazing
