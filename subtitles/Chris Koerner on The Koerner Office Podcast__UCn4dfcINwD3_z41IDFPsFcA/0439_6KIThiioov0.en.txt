look at this freaking thing right there
that might look like a covert but that's
not a covert that's your next business
idea and here's why so I'm here on my
property that's my front 2 Acres that's
my back one acre and it was all
separated by this dish you see right
here and so as I was looking to put some
Crush Granite over my ditch I started
looking for CTS most people will go
their whole lives and never have to say
the word Culvert these things are $500
from Tractor Supply for a big pipe I'm
not paying that so I started driving
around town and I saw him parked all
over the side of the road there was used
CT everywhere so I pulled over talked to
the guy that was standing by it and I
said hey can I have this he's like yeah
I'm throwing it away no problem free
covert and then you know how it is when
you learn about something new and then
you notice it everywhere I was seeing
free covert everywhere so then I thought
there needs to be a Marketplace for this
so then I went and bought these domain
names C for sale Culver city.com because
I wanted to aggregate where everyone is
buying and selling covers it sounds
stupid I know but then I went and looked
at Google Trends and saw this and then I
went and looked at the Google Keyword

[01:00]
went and looked at the Google Keyword
tool and saw this people are searching
for these no one's bidding on these
that's called an asymmetric bet this
doesn't even have to be a website or a
full-fledged business just drive around
in your truck pick up those covers put
them on Facebook Marketplace or
Craigslist and they'll sell for hundreds
of dollars trust me I see them listed
right here so am I going to start this
no cuz I have seven other businesses and
I'm too busy but you go start this and
I'll tell you what if you make some
traction I'll give you these domain
names for free full business plan right
here follow me for more ideas
