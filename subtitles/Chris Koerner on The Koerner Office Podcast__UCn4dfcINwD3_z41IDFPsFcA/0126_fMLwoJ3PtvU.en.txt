[00:00]
I'm doing in the range of like 1,500 to
2,000 and like sales per day it's
definitely trending up higher towards
like 2,000 I mean I Eclipse it here's
what happens they like all Clips it but
then like epsi or freay or somebody will
come in with like some price hike and
then you got to adjust your prices and
then you know you see a volume
[Music]
dip how's life since we last spoke
pretty good man how about you it's been
good where are you right now I'm in Utah
just on vacation kind of visiting family
nice nice why don't you just go ahead
and just tell everyone who you are what
you do and how you got to that point
real quick yeah for sure so I'm Quinn
Miller I own and operate a vending
machine business that's how I started
it's kind of expanded a little bit now
so I it's transformed into I do
traditional snack and drink we do like
smart coolers we do like Market Concepts
now I also have a ATM business as well I

[01:02]
now I also have a ATM business as well I
got into the business because I am based
in California and I'm love real estate
but the problem out here is that it's
heavy appreciation like cash flow and
yeah most people are like oh well why
why is that bad the reality is when
you're transitioning out of corporate or
whatever you know foundational income
cash flow is way more important than
appreciation in my opinion can I be
wrong can I take some loans on and live
off that yeah and then the appreciation
comes in and then you're good but so
effectively what happened was is I
bought some real estate out here with my
buddy I bought a property for quite a
bit we renovated it and then the cash FL
was so so light it was about like $700 a
month split between three parties and
when fresh out of college and this m
might sound crazy to a lot of people but
the house was like $550,000 right so it
wasn't cheap yeah and that's in San
Diego yeah yeah and so we did the
renovation and and the cash flow is

[02:00]
renovation and and the cash flow is
really poor but it reappraised for quite
a bit it reappraised for I think like
800 now wow which is awesome yeah but we
bought it at the back end of 2018 and
then I don't know maybe a year or two
later that's what it looked like and the
goal is to buy more right not just have
the money sitting there because I
couldn't have all my effectively life
savings sitting in this piece of
property not cash flowing at all they
didn't want to do it and so I got out of
that and I was looking
for alternative not going to say asset
classes but some things where I didn't
have to be there all the time low cost
of capital to enter and then had some
solid cash flow that's kind of where I
stumbled in a vending and I saw other
people doing it online that didn't
necessarily have the same background as
me from a sales perspective and so what
I did was I put it out my buddy's
mechanic shop a machine that I bought
off Craigslist and it didn't do good at
all but what I realized was I didn't
have to ever go there to make a sale so
that's good and bad if you never have to
go then the machine's not selling but I
learned and could you say that again
Quin cuz

[03:00]
Quin cuz
you cut out just for a minute you said
it it didn't do well at the mechanic
shop but then you
realized yeah so I never had to go there
so right if it's doing like yeah 150
bucks in sales and and the Machine holds
600 drinks right go they once every six
months or once every three months
whatever the number is so you at least
fell in love with that aspect of it but
you realize finding locations is going
to be harder than you thought good
finding good locations would be harder
than you I I didn't think it would be
harder than I thought I never even
Prospect and I I just what I saw was
like hey I never had to go there for the
sale and then so what I started doing
was making coold calls and then I landed
a location that did pretty well I think
it did maybe 1,500 bucks in the first
month so I was like okay now we can now
we have something here and what type of
location was that it was an apartment
building okay yeah and yeah so I landed
that and I was like okay we have
something here and then left corporate
and did that
full-time wow left corporate after the
second machine yeah granted I had about
let's see from getting out of the real
estate deal maybe like 60 80k so add

[04:02]
estate deal maybe like 60 80k so add
Capital to work with you got to live too
so it's not like that might sound like a
lot but the reality is in California
rents are insane I mean like a
one-bedroom apartment 500 F feet could
be $3,000 so cost of living is just
astronomical out here so that dwindles
down pretty fast after you quit your
corporate job what was your first plan
of action what did you start hitting the
phones calling apartments or what yeah
just straight up on all day every day
okay yeah so stock the machines and then
just Prospect all day every day was that
discouraging no no well my my first
software sales job I was an SDR and
we're making $200 a day so that's I
would say that's my one superpower I
have actually enjoy coold calling like I
can multitask while I co call like I can
do a bunch of things while I'm literally
coold calling and and that's just from
the 10,000 hours me putting in right I
had over 200 250,000 coal calls on my

[05:01]
had over 200 250,000 coal calls on my
belt by age like 25 26 so we were making
a lot of dials but so it become second
nature the thing that would slow me down
was like when I was grow when I was
first starting now was when you land a
location you got to prep the machines do
all this stuff so then I couldn't coold
call during those times because we're
just getting the machines ready to go
but yeah I think the thing that
separated me and my growth in the
business is a normal operator they are
going to stock machines all day and then
come home and you know drink a beer or
whatever relax whereas me had stock Mach
and to come back and make calls and so
that that's what really helped me grow
quickly everything you know today if you
could go back and like perfectly script
starting this business from scratch what
would you have
changed to make things really clean
really profitable really efficient I
don't know if I would change what I'm
doing but my recommendation would be to
other vendors is like what most people
do is they take on any location and so
what I recommend to them is be selective
just cuz somebody says yes doesn't mean
you should work with them them like

[06:00]
you should work with them them like
having a a ton of machines out there is
not better than having less but doing
more Revenue but the reality is most
people the hardest thing is the sales
right so for me it's not the sales it's
more the repairs on learning that aspect
of the business and then now it's for me
what's is tougher is just the backend
work I have what like 53 traditional
snack and drink it's some markets and so
there's just things that go on maybe
like today the credit card reader wasn't
working out or there was having some
like decline transaction so that's
what's tougher for me so my
recommendation to new vendors is to just
be selective or just for most people
again they don't have the sales side of
thing so buy an existing route as a
because a lot of people they will like
if you co call for six months and you
don't get any deals I I think like 99%
of people are just G be like I'm not
doing this anymore hly after a week
they're going to say that so A lot of
times it's better just buy a location
off somebody that is already established
and then so then that way you have the

[07:00]
and then so then that way you have the
momentum because in business especially
when you're leaving corporate like yeah
the hardest part is like literally just
leaving corporate but then it has to be
followed by momentum if not you're just
going to be defeated yeah and the
momentum makes me think like even if you
could go back in time and be more picky
about your locations even if you pick a
bad location at least it's momentum and
you're going to learn from that you know
what I'm saying so it's almost like you
wouldn't change much because it's like
you got to win even if it's a crappy
location you got win under your belt
which will line up a bigger win down the
line yeah for sure and that's another
thing like the anybody getting new into
the business I know they want the
biggest accounts right away but the
thing where I learned the most was that
mechanic shop where I could fail and
learn about the machines and just they
had no expectation right so if you get
go get a big account like we're gonna
have a bunch of expectations and it
might be overwhelming for you is there a
correlation between a crappy location
like a mechanic shop and the ease of
actually closing that deal or there is
there really no correlation yeah yeah I
know I know you're going with us do a
bigger deal yeah for sure the bigger you

[08:01]
bigger deal yeah for sure the bigger you
go and the like bigger business like
there's more number one there's more red
tape and number two there's more
competition so if I were to go Prospect
an Amazon warehouse It's not like just
you just go call up the warehouse
manager and say Hey you need some
machines like you got to I have to
assume you're going to be submitting RFP
and then you're going to be going up
against like other like National Vendors
where they're playing a different game
right they push a lot of products they
get rebates they have ties with the big
National dist rors and so they can
probably do things that you can't do
that make financially sense that make
Financial sense so yeah no it's not like
the bigger deals you do the harder it is
yeah I don't know some people say that
in real estate like smaller deals are
the same as big but it's not the same
here well what if someone had the
strategy of saying listen I know that
all of these mechanic shops are only
going to pay out 300 bucks a month on
average but I can close 20% of those
deals as opposed to 2% of the big deals
so

[09:00]
so
I I know the the payback period for
machine will be a lot longer but could
someone have that strategy just like I'm
going to place a ton of these low
performing machines because it's easy
and that's just my model yeah well
that's what most people do and what I
would say is yeah that's cool when you
first start but once you get to a
certain size it becomes a logistics game
right so it's like how do I get X
product from Warehouse to the locations
and then at the end of the day they're
machines so you don't need somebody
there to make a sale but they do have
problems right and so like you have just
like 100 machines and you got to send
out a repair guy or something like that
stuff adds up versus like just
concentrating on your bigger accounts
like where they're actually producing
real revenue and making a sizable
difference it's okay if you have a
repair guy go out there but if this is
consistently happening then that's just
GNA destroy the business back to cold
calling if you make a thousand cold
calls and what does your funnel look
like how many do you actually talk to
and how many sales could you expect to
get from that yeah I I used to track
these numbers and software sales when we

[10:00]
these numbers and software sales when we
had like Salesforce and all stuff and I
think that's like beneficial it's it's
probably beneficial if you're running
like not a onean org I I guess it is but
I I me personally I don't really need to
track those numbers I think maybe I
shouldn't but I don't really get
motivated based off like the numbers
where that's what a lot of people need
to see they need to see like how well
they're converting but so for me I don't
know the exact number but if there's a
thousand potential locations and I'm
able to talk to the decision maker I
have a pretty high hit rate in regards
to like actually closing those deals if
I were to look at my pipeline a reason
why somebody would not work with me is
not because of like my pitch or anything
like that it's more so you know it's a
luxury apartment building and they're
just like we don't have room or
ownership we just spent five $300
million on this property whatever the
number is and they're just like no so I
don't have the exact number but what I
can say is like closing percentage is
like way higher in this business and i'
say software sales m

[11:00]
say software sales m
okay and I think the important part is
you like making cold calls and like this
kind of like finding joy in the journey
right is what you're doing and it's not
a grind to you it's just part of the
process yeah for sure so you just relate
it back to like accounting or anything
like that like for me like I hate it
like I would have to close off a whole
calendar like a whole day just to review
this stuff but for cold clients no
problem I can right after this call like
even if I'm hungry I can make a CO call
I cannot look at a county if I'm hungry
but for some people it's not right so it
really just depends on the person but
yeah and then some people say oh do cold
emailing stuff like that I from my
experience in the the SMB World from
software sales I I don't think it's as
effective like these owners are not
checking their emails like they're
running a business and so that's why I
think it's not as effective and so at
the end of the day there's like a finite
amount of places that I can actually
work with so that's why I don't go that
route but a lot of people will go the
cold em miling route what is your
bestselling product it die

[12:00]
bestselling product it die
coke uh coke coke yeah 12 O can't Coke
break down the unit economics of that
like what do you sell for what do you
buy for and then how do you look at like
your cost of a fill yeah so a 12 ounce
soda from Costco I believe right now
it's 49 cents I sell for
$150 now the one thing there is like
okay so when I first started inv vending
a soda was 33 cents okay and I used to
sell for a dollar so it's pretty healthy
profit margin but at the end of the day
when they it was at 52 cents at one
point and they just lowered it but the
of the day there is only a certain price
that somebody's willing to pay for these
products right and so if they raise the
price let's just say to 75 cents like
I'm not gonna raise the I'm not gonna
sell a 12 oce can of Coke for for $2
right yeah you got to eat it well I'm
just going to change the product right
because my whole thing is like I I want
my customers to see
I want them to feel like they're getting

[13:00]
I want them to feel like they're getting
value anytime they're shopping with me
because this is not a transient customer
if you're doing Apartments if you're
doing hotels like you can do you charge
whatever you want and I have hotels as
well but if you do office and stuff like
that they need to see they need to feel
like they're getting value every time
they use this and if they do that then
they they'll use the machine a lot um so
yeah Koke is probably my best seller and
then I've been transitioning a lot to
like Pepsi and 7 Up stuff deade is a big
seller for sure but those prices have
been going going crazy recently like I
recently had to increase the price to
like 250 unfortunately and I think one
thing to note is I think it's a big
misconception so I use Pepsi 7even up uh
Vistar which is a food supplier Costco
and Sam's Club and the reason why I use
all these different places is because I
work with Pepsi 7 Up in Vistar for the
bulk of my stuff but when I utilize them
the prices are more expensive than going
to Sam's clber Costco and so I'll buy my
Cann soda from Sam's Club actually and

[14:02]
Cann soda from Sam's Club actually and
so that that's a big misconception
they're like oh you go direct to them
they're cheaper no but what they are
doing is they are delivering the
products to my warehouse and so it's
challenging for me to be able to pick up
let's just say six to eight pallets per
week of just product and and that's a
lot of man out right and so that's why
that makes sense to do that stuff I
guess another good seller for me is
Celsius that's really popular nowaday
monsters obviously big and then what's
getting Challen in now is the candy they
raised the prices so much like the like
Hershey and stuff like that that it's
getting very expensive to sell and I'm
starting to transition out of that like
I'll have some Staples in there but I'm
transitioning more like cookies and and
stuff like that in those candy row what
about like salty snacks what are the the
good
sellers salty snack like chips and stuff
yeah yeah um so I was well so we're I'm
in Southern California so spicy stuff is
like hot fries like Chester hot fries um

[15:03]
like hot fries like Chester hot fries um
um Cheeto Cheetos Hot Cheeto lime like
those so like Gang
Busters um and then let's
see U I don't really sell like peanuts
or anything like that um but in regard I
used to sell LS and Lays barbecue but
I've I recently transitioned over the B
to Boulder chips because Fredo is
actually again raising prices again so
I'm trying to look for Alternatives that
are similar but where I don't have to
raise prices I'm recently I've always
I've been looking through a lot of that
stuff I was actually lited at a
conference in Dallas and I was just
checking out a bunch of new products and
seeing like what is out there that I'm
missing yeah that's what I was going to
ask what has owning this business taught
you about consumer psychology or
consumer Behavior because it's like
everyone says they want to eat healthy
people want but it's like I don't know
how I don't foresee Doritos not being
around in a hundred years you know yeah
it it just seems like human nature will

[16:01]
it it just seems like human nature will
always allow for people to eat like crap
yeah so so my take on the situation is
that so America shops at Walmart Okay
and they do not shop at Whole Foods like
just because you and your friends do
does not mean that like I say 90% but a
majority of America that's not where
they shop okay and a majority of
Americans do not eat drink raw milk and
nice steaks and and all this crap right
yes it is very nice for us but most
people are just barely getting by right
and so these products it's the same
thing with cash everybody's like oh it's
cash dead no it's nowhere close to being
dead same thing with with gas for cars
it's nowhere close to being dead these
unhealthy product unhealthy products
they would say if you consume them for
your every single meal yeah like that's
not good but if you have a bag of
Doritos and a sandwich and a drink like
it's not the best for you but at the end
of day it's not like going to absolutely
kill you so
I think there just a big misconception

[17:00]
I think there just a big misconception
out there in regards to what consumers
want I was literally at a I was touring
a property the other day or yesterday
and the property manager is like yeah we
really like your fresh food products
like sandwiches salads stuff like that
she's like that's going to be a big
driver for business I'm like maybe but
what I can tell they'll be a first for
me that that's not the reality and that
that's going off to another point so a
lot of people will come up to me like
hey can you put X into the machine
and I'll look at it and I'll say I
always test products and then start to
change things so if LS is selling well
I'll add more products just like lays if
lays is selling bad I'll reduce the lay
and add whatever is selling more right
and so they always say like hey put this
put that and what I've learned in the
business so far is you only do things
based off what people are doing with
their money not their amou um and
anytime somebody has told me this to
make this change for what they want they
they never buy it right and other people

[18:00]
they never buy it right and other people
don't buy it either U and it'll always
be like some specialty product right
like hey can you put coconut water in
this machine it's like no like
absolutely I'm not doing that yeah if 50
people came in here and told me please
put coconut water and then I put it in
there and then they all bought it then I
would consider putting it other places
but that's just not how it works for my
experience so far so I I want to learn
more about you testing products or
testing like vending Concepts have you
ever tried something like a $5 like
ollipop soda or whatever those are
called or a vending machine that was
just completely off thee wall just to
see how it would do and like tell me
about a time where you've done that and
you were surprised one way or the other
yeah for sure so so what I would say is
like testing products is much easier in
my markets because open concept
customers have a little more
discretionary income and then on my
traditional machines like each product
has a slot right so it's hard like you
got to change it in the back end the
team's got to go put it in it's it's a
little more challenging
so my markets I always Test new things

[19:01]
so my markets I always Test new things
right like a lot of my Food suppliers
they be like hey we're doing it's called
short codes right like it's a deal but
the products going to expire in two
months or like faster than normal and so
I always do those and not all the time
but whenever they send it to me and I
always test like new products and stuff
like that and I haven't really tested
like products on the high end but what I
can say is people are willing to spend a
lot of money for like household items so
if they really need it they're going to
they're to spend money on it so like
I'll put like medicine and stuff like
this and I'll still maintain a 50%
margin at least that's my goal so if you
buy MRA or Claritin like Claritin is not
a cheap product just in itself if you
were to buy it from from Walmart I think
it's like don't quote me on the side
have to look but let's just say the
bottle for like 24 of them is like 15
bucks right and then if you sell for 30
I don't know to me that's a lot of money
a lot thing with B bees chapstick like
it's not cheap you buy from Walmart and

[20:00]
it's not cheap you buy from Walmart and
people will still buy it if they really
need it they'll just buy it so I think
that's the biggest Learning lesson that
I've seen so far in regards to the
testing but for th for those like
abstract drinks I'm kind of a I don't
know I'm not a huge fan of them and
quite frankly well you you'd be a huge
fan of them if they sold
right I don't know and for me man if I
will not consume it if I will not
purchase it for myself I generally not
will not put it in my machine like all
the products that I put in I'll take a
bite before I put it in if I get new
product I I will literally take a bite
not say going to eat it but I'll try it
taste it if it doesn't taste well I
don't care what it is I'm not putting it
in there if I couldn't be the main
consumer I can't expect my customers to
be a consumer as well now could I be
wrong there potentially yes but it
serving well so far yeah so what about
vending machines what if you went what
if you had like a poor performing
vending machine in a really strong
apartment complex and you're just
surprised it's not doing well have you
ever thought about approaching the owner
and say hey I'm going to swap out this
machine with an Electronics machine with

[21:01]
machine with an Electronics machine with
usb chargers there just doesn't have to
be that but anything completely
different from food just to see how it
goes what do I have to lose have you
ever done that or thought of doing that
no it's good ideas is for sure I
actually have a buddy that does like
rental out of machines so like you can
rent a he does what what out of machines
you can it's a little bit different
machine but what it is like you can open
it up and then you can rent like a beach
chair or something like that I don't
know like when you start doing these
like funky things like number one the
machine is like more expensive so let's
just say you want to do like hot food
right like that machine
is 20 $30,000 right to have a hot food
machine right like that that can bake
you a pizza right and then just like
logistically it's more challenging
there's just like other factors that are
involved with just literally just
testing it out what I would say I've
tested like smart coolers where it's
like you swipe your card you open the
the machine you kind of grab anything
you want and automatically charge you
maybe I'll put some funky things in
there but outside of food and stuff like
that I I generally don't test too

[22:00]
that I I generally don't test too
much yeah you're pretty married to food
though right like you're you have food
vendors you have a warehouse for food
you have systems around food you have
expiration dates I think it it'd be kind
of tough to take one vending machine and
swap it out with something non food yeah
it's just so the way I build my business
is try to be like the for assembly line
right everything is going through the
same all machines are getting the same
things for the most part right maybe if
somebody was wanting to get in there and
stock stuff thems then I'm sure you
could or even just building a team
around that but I I don't know it's just
for me it's just easier just to do what
I do yeah how many different products do
you carry actively today give or take
yeah it's a good question I know for
sure it's ranging from the range of I
believe like two to 400 I think is is
kind of the number I exactly but I I
actually went through it recently I I
didn't take an exact number but I
started cutting out some things because
I was like man I have way too many skes
because I think I was at like M 600 yeah
yeah and it it like a lot but the
reality is like when you look at these

[23:00]
reality is like when you look at these
machines like the glass face machines
like every single slot could potentially
be different the snack machine same
thing and then not all like I have
different consumers across different
places and so it adds up quickly like
the easiest way to run this business is
literally just have a drink machine
where you click the button so it has
holds like eight different products and
just put a bunch of those out there uh
your life will
beable the drink machines are the
easiest yeah yeah for sure because like
you can buy a case of it and just put it
in there like you don't really need
story yeah and I've heard like stories
of people doing that just literally just
a drink machine only
route H yeah what numbers can you tell
me with regards to your volume like
snacks sold per day or machines placed
or Revenue I'd love to hear anything
you're willing to share yeah for sure
I'm doing it the range of like 1,500 to
2,000 in in uh like sales per day nice
yeah it's definitely trending up higher

[24:00]
yeah it's definitely trending up higher
towards like 2000 I mean here's what
happens though like all Clips it but
then
like Pepsi or freeay somebody will come
in with some price hike and then you got
to adjust your prices and then you see a
volume dip so like right now we're going
through the process of changing prices
and it sucks when you have to do that
because when I first started out again
like if you have a dollar in your pocket
you can get a Coke ice cold Coke coldest
Coke you ever had in your life and I
think that's a pretty strong value
proposition but now you have to have
a150 so you have to have some Chang
varet yeah is there a day of the week
that's typically busier for you so I I
have some locations at are Monday
through Friday so Monday through Friday
I I do more volume but okay yeah on the
weekends it's still up there but it's
some of the locations aren't online
basically okay so I want to switch gears
and I want to get your thoughts on this
vending concept so I came across this
concept in Europe and it is a perfume
vending machine have you seen these
I I I have I haven't dove into it and

[25:01]
I I I have I haven't dove into it and
see how it works but i' I've seen a
picture the ones that spray perfume
specifically yeah I've heard of the
concept yeah yeah so I don't think it
really exists here in the US and that
could mean that it's just not a good
cultural fit but you put in five bottles
of of perfume and there's like a little
glass case where you can see them and
then there's a little plastic tube going
in each of the bottles and it's you know
cashless swipe your card and for a
dollar you just put your wrist up or
your neck or whatever and it sprays on
you and it's got 90% margins you don't
have to refill it that that often you
also have the option to sell the whole
bottles with a QR code with like
affiliate links drop ship it right I
thought that was interesting they're
like $2500 machines do you think that
could work and if so what type of a
venue do you think that would be good in
and like what type of Hang-Ups do you
think one could
experience yeah I think it I mean could
it work I don't know it's going to take
somebody to go do it to let us know I
think but yeah could you see it at fine
dining like when the guy in the bathroom
gives you like the mints and all this

[26:00]
gives you like the mints and all this
stuff like you just have it in there as
opposed to that guy maybe trying to
think where else I mean maybe a strip
club let's
see I wonder if like in the bathroom at
a gym right and you like you're kind of
stinky and just like ah I don't want to
smell like crap here's a dollar so maybe
I don't yeah yeah good even trying to
any of these exotic ideas I think 2500
bucks for a machine is fine but then on
you see some of those machines at the
airport where they're doing like I don't
know Cosmetics all these things like
those machines are incredibly pricey
it's easy to do like a couple of them
but then when you really want to scale
the business like it's becomes
challenging yeah especially if they're
all over the country or over the world
right yeah and and the reality is like
for you to get high volume on these like
Niche machines I should say they need to
be at like very heavily trafficked areas
or just like for the exact audience and
are you going to be able to sell
like I don't know th can you really sell
like that many people like with these

[27:00]
like that many people like with these
types of venues to do that how many fine
dining places are going to want that are
gyms going to have the space for it
there's just a lot of different factors
that go into this that I think makes it
a little challenging and what I would
say is like don't let anything but don't
let my words discourage anybody if
they're like listening to this and
they're like oh I want to try ideas I
always think that they should try it out
and then learn based off what they see
in the marketplace and what's taking
place just because I am willing to do it
and I don't do it doesn't mean that you
should not because a lot of people will
tell me things like don't do these
certain locations certain areas or
whatever and I'll go do it and it's like
why aren't you doing these yeah yeah
people fantasize about a lot of things
and my fantasy is like snapping my
fingers and having 10 of those perfume
machines placed tomorrow at 10 different
venues like a gym a strip club a movie
theater a mall hallway a gas station a
restaurant Street Side in New York I
would just love to have all those place
at the snap of finger and then just look

[28:00]
at the snap of finger and then just look
at the analytics come in you know it's
like wow oh the gas station's killing it
that's surprising you know exactly yeah
yeah yeah and then once you figure it
out then you can expand from there but
yeah I mean like other niches like that
I think are interesting like I I've
heard like people talk about Juke boxes
I think that's interesting you posted
about the massage share that's
interesting I think that that machine is
probably a little pricey see what else
there's a whole Bevy of things like that
are like credit card reader based
machines machine based businesses I
should say that are potentially very
interesting I I my only thing is like is
just scaling it up what is the easiest
thing to do but you know at the day a
lot of people they don't want to scale
it up like it's you could you just have
10 machines locally and just have some
nice side income yeah that's probably
fine for like majority of people to be
honest yeah the hard part is with these
new exotic machines is like there can't
be much friction like you have four
seconds to convince a consumer that they
should swipe their card here so if it's
like too weird or like a gold bar
machine like you have to have the right

[29:01]
machine like you have to have the right
person in the right location and they
have to grasp it immediately otherwise
you're just going to lose everyone I
think my favorite one was I was in
college or we were visiting so I went to
Michigan State we were checking it out
and we went to this tiny little
bar I guess it wasn't Tiny But it a
sports bar like in the middle of nowhere
and we go in go to the Ural and I can
pay money to see how big my P is and so
basically what it is like I go pee and
it's like oh can you set the record like
biggest what yeah how big your p is like
how much volume you put out yeah yeah
yeah yeah I got to write that down that
is crazy one of the more interesting
Concepts I saw and and here's the
reality like men are extremely
competitive so it's like if two dudes
are doing that like like you're probably
gonna be like hey let's try this out and
I did try it out right you did and how
big is your pee yeah I take big
P's so how I can't even picture what

[30:00]
P's so how I can't even picture what
this looks like I'm gonna spend an hour
Googling this today I hope you know but
like would you pee into something and it
like measures it on a like a ounces
basis no no no it's it's like just a
Ural and there's like a a trap I think
at the bottom okay yeah you're not like
peeing in a cup or anything but you have
to pay yeah then there's like a game
thing on top that'll like a
leaderboard yeah this is many quite a
few years ago so like maybe designs have
changed but yeah that's effectively what
it was like you pee and there's like a
leaderboard I think it was like for the
day though I all
time wow holy cow to be the guy that
thinks of that idea and then spends who
knows how much money to get it developed
like right now that's crazy like people
that invent things like that I think are
the opposite of me because I have too
many ideas and so I'm going to go with
the cheapest the least amount of
friction the one I can test for $10000
but some people they go 60 80 years and

[31:00]
but some people they go 60 80 years and
they get one big idea right and they're
going to go all in on that one idea and
it's like that's how these stupid things
come to be that sometimes end up being
successful is because that one guy just
had that one idea and he had to and I
mean respect right I respect anyone that
executes on an idea because most people
just think about it until they die and
then they regret it but yeah yeah no
it's a really interesting concept I
would say the only problem is like from
a maintenance perspective you're having
to deal with like uh
I don't know go bad it's all fills with
pee right yeah that is
crazy so I know you're leaning hard into
ATMs last time we spoke are you still
doing that and how has that been going
yeah for sure it's it's going good I I
like the business a lot it's a very
clean business your inventory is Cash um
which is nice and that's a very simple
business right like when you look at a
vending machine there's a lot of SKS
it's you know challenging to get the
products from point A to point B you got

[32:01]
products from point A to point B you got
to it's just a lot more work right now
the the main difference between the two
is of any machine has the potential to
do a much much more Revenue more Revenue
than ATM machine will ever
do you know it's the ATM is much simpler
right it's put money in you get hit with
a search charge and that's how you make
money now there are some locations that
could probably do quite a bit of Revenue
you know a strip club or a casino or a
dispensary I was doing due diligence on
a disp on a dispensary location in in
Colorado and it was doing you were
netting like 50k a year on three
locations which is pretty solid and so
that's a lot of Rue you know
so three dispensary locations 50 Grand a
year yeah pretty good right wow yeah
that's good I have my notes from our
last chat and you said that like you're
looking for four to five 600 bucks per
machine per
month yeah yeah yeah for sure at least

[33:02]
month yeah yeah yeah for sure at least
like locations that I see around here so
yeah what is that number what is that
50,000 let's see she's a the 16 Grand a
month yeah right or sorry sorry that's
per year though right yeah 50,000 16
Grand a year so it's like
1,400 a month 1500 per machine so three
four times as much
crazy if you can get locations like that
and look I mean was this been that great
of a dispenser I don't even know right
like why is the guy I mean he could be
selling it because the laws and stuff
like that but yeah I'm sure like there's
monster dispensaries out there like in
Vegas specifically like Planet 13 or
whatever it is like it's huge and you
know could this thing be peeling off a
100 Grand a year or a month probably
yeah are you trying to convince people
that already have ATMs to swap them out
with yours or are you trying to place
ATMs where there is none it's a good
question majority time where there is
none it's challenge so from a value

[34:02]
none it's challenge so from a value
proposition perspective I can win a lot
of business on from the vending
perspective if the if the their current
operator is providing poor service and
the ATM's a little bit more challenging
just because the only
time like an ATM is not working is like
if it's out of cash or the machine is
broken right and most of the time
vending machine will not break it's just
like they put bad products in they don't
do the they don't repair the machines
they don't fill the machines like that
doesn't happen as much as ATM so it's a
little more challenging to Wi that
business that said I I have one accounts
from aazan vendors a couple but I don't
think that's the lowest Hing fruit okay
what types of locations are you in again
I I thought you said gas stations the
last time we spoke I I do a lot of
hotels hotels okay for ATMs specifically
yeah yeah
okay are you in any gas station
no I'm not interesting would you like to

[35:01]
no I'm not interesting would you like to
be I'm open to it the reason why I'm at
hotels is because I originally bought a
route off a guy yeah somebody that was
retiring from the business and I bought
a route from him and he just had a bunch
of hotels and so I kind of just built it
baseed off that little niche most gas
stations they they're going to have an
ATM and so gas stations it would
probably like to qu to get those they
would need to have a very poor operator
um or I'd need to acquire somebody's
business
from at least just from a macro
perspective now once I get into weeds
and start calling them like could that
change probably but so far that's kind
of what I see do you find yourself when
you go when you're just driving living
your everyday life not even working you
go somewhere and you're like oh jeez
this place needs an ATM oh this oh they
would crush it right there do you do
that yeah for sure for sure do you ever
do something about it like go talk to
the manager right then yeah absolutely
if I think it's a good spot then I I
will do you have a story of a Time that
you've done that like impromptu and it
worked out no I haven't done it too much

[36:03]
worked out no I haven't done it too much
for ATMs are a little bit newer and or
vending machines yeah yeah so so like
vending for sure like like I'll do I
have any example of this I don't think I
I do let me see off the top of my head I
know I was at breakfast the other day
and I talked to the I believe it was a
general manager I was just like hey I'm
in the ATM business you guys know I'm an
ATM machine like have you ever
considered this they're like oh no we
don't have enough room in the waiting
like in the the lobby and I was like H
okay like I wasn't really pursuing it
that hard but yeah I mean the idea comes
to my head there was an account where
I'm not going to disclose the location
but yeah that we did it at was actually
one of my buddies he brought it up to me
and he talked to the management group
and then we got the deal done that's a
great thing to do for like newer people
getting into the business it's like if
they see an opportunity like just don't
be scared to take advantage of it right
like sit there and then call the number
when you get home go up to the person

[37:00]
when you get home go up to the person
and see what's going on if anything like
they're going to say no but it will
allow you to learn like just some
information that maybe you wouldn't have
like without asking yeah like I'm
thinking of something that I did I was
buying and flipping single family homes
and we were scaling this around the
state and I would pay people on
Craigslist to go just drive around and
take pictures of dilapidated homes and
then submit them to like a Google drive
with their address and I'd pay him like
five bucks per home and it had to be
there had to be a picture and an address
and then I would use a VA to go find the
contact information to reach out to them
because that's one of those things that
you just can't really scale right and
I'm thinking like
what okay with homes specifically yeah
so when we were looking at San Diego I
was just cruising around just looking
for just [ __ ] holes you could totally do
that with this like you could find a guy
say hey I want to find gas stations
under construction because they're going
to need one and I want to find hotels
that don't have them or any apartment

[38:00]
that don't have them or any apartment
that doesn't have either an ATM or a
vending machine and I'll give you 20
bucks for every address you give me and
I'll give you 40 or a 100 bucks if you
can just go up to the person say hey can
I have my business partner come in
person because I know you told me that
in person closes like much much higher
than phone and queue up an appointment
what if you did that you just had
because that's one of those things where
you can't like scrape a list of hotels
that don't have ATMs like you got to
drive around to hotels yeah I do you one
better what what we do is uh we call and
we say hey me and my girlfriend are
looking at uh Booker room there next
week and I
was to use and if they say no then Mark
it down yeah genius genius and you can
have anyone make that call right you
could scale that
infinitely has that worked pretty
well yeah for sure but I I think the the
the the reality is like there's only a
finite amount of places is you could you
could probably do this there's more gas

[39:01]
could probably do this there's more gas
like there's only a finite amount of
hotels right so especially ones that are
like big enough and stuff like that
makes sense so gas stations this would
probably make a little more sense to do
this to just like literally Scorch the
Earth because like the reality is if
there's a gas station there's going to
be quite a bit of foot traffic right not
all hotels get the same amount of foot
traffic and not all hotels the customers
really wants to demand or really really
wants to even use the machines yeah I I
remember you told me that for like a $5
transaction fee you're sending a $125 to
the vter who fills up the machine with
money and about a buck to the location
owner give or take that leaves you with
you know 250 or so do you have to like
how often do do you or someone on your
team have to go visit that ATM in person
if you have a volter yeah yeah the
volter is handling everything so they're
going weekly typically to fill the
machine make sure it's working properly
now this is a professional vter right
like there there's probably others out
there that are not professional but

[40:00]
there that are not professional but
they're volters for me what I do is I
actually will still hand deliver the
checks I like to have relationships with
all my accounts and so at the end of the
month or the first day of the next month
I'll drive around to the locations and
give the checks to the team talk to them
or the the the management at the at the
sites talk to them and see see what's
going on build a relationship stuff like
that where
most most people will just do like
direct a deposit and it's very
transactional um mhm should I do that
yeah probably to scale but I don't know
what I'm doing right now works I have
enough time to be able to do that
there's other operators that are
nationwide unless it's not even possible
so you you can't do that would you say
that your growth is constrained by your
the city that you're in if you're if the
city SL Market you were in within the
same geographical footprint had 10 times
as many people 10 times as many hotels
gas stations y y y would you be able to
just grow like Gang Busters or are you
constrained by other
factors there's definitely other factors
there's other operators in space like
for ATMs specifically yeah ATMs there's

[41:01]
for ATMs specifically yeah ATMs there's
other there's a ton of operators like if
look if it's blue ocean then and there's
like I'm just cracking into the business
and then no I could grow to like
Infinity but I I think like out outside
of like potential locations I think the
bigger factor for like growth hurdles is
definitely like a crowded Market again
it's harder to from my experience so far
I think it's harder to have that value
proposition to take over existing
operators right if I had the Magic
Bullet and outside of just paying more
commissions because that that that's not
a value proposition in my opinion that's
what a lot of people do they just say
hey what's your current information oh
okay I'll give you more let me get my
you know machine in here I don't really
roll that way I'm not going to compete
on commission I don't think that's good
business but if there wasn't other
operators out there like yeah again I
could just grow it huge yeah because I'm
thinking like what if and I it could be
like quote trying to solve a problem
that you don't have but but let's say
you were to identify five big markets

[42:00]
you were to identify five big markets
like other side of the country anywhere
in the US and you were to take a th000
bucks and find five vas to call up a
thousand hotels in each market put them
all in a spreadsheet and say all right
well Jacksonville is only 20% saturated
but Charlotte is 40% saturated and I
know that my market this is my Baseline
of what I'm used to is 30% so anything
under 30% I'm going to have an easier
way of growing than in my market and
you've got an audience you can use your
audience to find like operating Partners
in each area where it's like listen
here's how I do business I don't compete
on price I hand deliver the checks but I
got to install the machines like I'm
looking for someone you can get a
percentage of my Revenue directly from
that that can be like just my presence
you install the machine you hand deliver
the check and then we still use a vter
etc do you think that'd be possible yeah
and dude look I love talking to you
because you're always thinking bigger is
it possible yeah for sure one I would
say and and this is not like take it at

[43:00]
say and and this is not like take it at
the bank gossip but if you're going to
be expanding Across the Nation the
reality is is like will this Niche work
in Jacksonville I don't know right like
you gotta go find out it's not like I
don't think you just full send it
everywhere it's like a process now
obviously you know maybe different
niches it's literally it doesn't matter
again so strip clubs hotels or not
hotels casinos and gas okay so gas
stations strip clubs marijuana
dispensaries and like casinos I'm sure
full
stop if you put them anywhere across the
United States they're going to do
business right will hotels translate I
don't know right like I test it out and
I'm sure it will but I don't know the
type of volume and doesn't make sense to
do all this stuff so it just requires a
little more DD in my opinion or just
literally doing it yeah that's what's
interesting to me about picking five
markets because you could learn that the
market you're in is a lot harder than
average than the Baseline you know and
you take these five markets Jacksonville
is 10% saturated your Market 30
everything else was 70 plus and then

[44:00]
everything else was 70 plus and then
it's like okay if I do you don't even
have to full send it but if I do start
making cold calls into Jacksonville or
find an operating partner in
Jacksonville like I could look up my
market be like dude what am I doing here
I need to move to Jacksonville it's so
much easier there you know yeah and
you're 100% right 100% right it just it
literally it will just take me to just
do that right yeah but if you're already
busy as it is not really neat hey if
there's a will away my
friend that's true are you still wanting
to sell your business at some point I'm
open to it I think well yeah yeah for
sure well at a certain point for sure I
would say I I was always building the
business to create a bridge to bigger
things I think it's very hard to scale
my business to let's just say 20 30
million that's very challenging to do
and so you know I would like to get into
other Ventures where that's doable I
think in my market like there's service
based business businesses or just other
things that like do these types of
numbers right like I don't have where

[45:01]
numbers right like I don't have where
they don't need to go to five different
markets just to get to that number so
that's kind of how I think about it and
yeah it's nice to have liquidity and not
have to raise a [ __ ] ton of money or
just get a bunch of debt like you can
just like if you see a good deal you
just do it right like as opposed to like
really selling the dream to a bunch of
people yeah yeah last time we spoke I we
talked about potentially raising money
to growth by acquisition have you
thought any more about that I I think
the challenge is just getting that
operator in place if I'm buying outside
of like where my core operation is just
getting an operator it's not as as easy
as like just snapping the fingers
getting someone in there being reliable
to do it so I haven't thought about it
too much but it is an interesting idea I
think that I'm just kind of like still
growing like organically and I haven't
really seen a need to do that yet but
again last time we spoke like you
mentioned these things to me and I
probably should be thinking about these

[46:00]
probably should be thinking about these
things more and I'm trying to create a
path where I am actually creating a path
where I'm doing less of the day-to-day
like backend work because I that's
really just not advantageous for me or
it's not like the best use of my time so
I have I had a VA and then now I hired
another VA that's a little more has a
more robust skill set to be able to
handle mainly the back end of the
business and the day-to-day operations
and so that will allow me a like more
time to to think about opportunities
like that and see if we can like really
pursue it basically what I've learned
from you and talking to you over a few
short hours like it doesn't even matter
what you choose like whether you you
sell your business or you make it a $10
million business growth by acquisition
or you go to freaking Jacksonville or
you only do ATMs like you're already
doing the harder things like you've
already mastered cold calling and if you
can cold call you can do anything you're
already like doing things that quote
don't scale the high touch things hand
delivering like you've already mastered
these skills that you can apply to
anything so it literally doesn't matter
what decision you make like you're going
to crush it you're going to do great I

[47:02]
to crush it you're going to do great I
appreciate it I definitely would not say
I mastered like the operational side of
things I think I mastered the fact that
I really don't like
it same yeah and so you just learn so
much stuff like about yourself and so if
I were to acquire something that I would
definitely need a partner in that to do
the operational side of things and still
be there with them and learning and
stuff like that but just allow me to do
more of the sales and growth and stuff
like that which I know a lot of people
like they they want to do that but so
yeah yeah I'm learning a ton for sure
definitely not a master still learning
and anytime I talk to people just like
you I'm learning a ton other guy
Mitchell who does ATMs I mean he's
taking the concept and raised money and
got a bunch of ATMs like could I have
done that for sure when I first started
out and was tweeting they like dude how
do I invest they still do right they hit
me up all the time like can I invest in
the business and I've just always been
like yeah like I don't really need it
right but yeah could I take that that
money and acquire it a bunch of routes
and have a $5 million a year business

[48:01]
and have a $5 million a year business
right now like yeah for sure could have
yeah but yeah once again it doesn't
matter you're in the game so along those
same lines if if an investor wants to
reach out or an operator wants to reach
out where can they find you yeah the
best place is Twitter just shoot me a DM
or something like that more than happy
to chop it up if I don't respond or
something like that it's not cuz I don't
like you as would I get a lot of
messages
if you're asking me this long with
question I'm not gonna be able to type
you a paragraph back
unfortunately but you do have a you do
have a course that people can buy right
where can they find that yeah I have a
course so what I recommend to people is
don't just buy the course check out my
pin tweet if you still don't know what
to do and you're like man I still need
more help feel free to buy the course it
it'll teach you a b a bunch but I think
I have enough free information out there
where you can get buy and then if all
that stuff is still not enough
information feel free to schedule a call
me I know a lot of people prefer to just
chat by the course and so you can
schedule call me and I'll tell you my

[49:02]
schedule call me and I'll tell you my
story and I will tell you yes no what I
think is right what I think is wrong
yeah those are the main ways yeah
everyone's different like some people
will read a pin tweet and go start eving
business and some people like need you
to hold their hand the whole
way or they just want like a a paid call
so it it's Quinn Qi n NJ Miller at
Twitter right yeah yep
okay well thanks Quinn this was great I
think a lot of people are interested in
vending I know I am you've got an
awesome business you're an awesome
person and thanks time yeah thanks for
having me on we got to get you a vending
machine next dude I'll do it I'll do it
dude don't even tempt me I'll start any
business anytime it's a problem it's a
clinical addiction I love it I love it
so well thanks for your time man it was
good catching up with you again all
right man we'll talk soon all right see
you
