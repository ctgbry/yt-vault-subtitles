[00:00]
this is so good you don't even need a
person you just drop off a pod one day
you plug everything in you connect it to
the internet and you walk away and
everything's uploaded to the cloud I
think it's a cool business I think you
can make a lot of money but I also just
think it's a freaking cool service
selling something that you feel like is
actually bringing joy to people if
there's somebody who loves it or is like
trying to build this out contact me I'm
serious that's a great idea I really
love that
[Music]
idea all right what are my options all
right here are your options still
tsunami or a phone reminder different
silver tsunami from a couple weeks ago
it's my favorite silver tsunami I've
ever thought of I told you I'm gonna try
to have a silver tsunami every week oh
okay well we got to go with that all
right so my background is in healthcare
and I own home health and hospice
companies I love those services but
they're so hard you're on
247 and in hospice it's death and dying
somebody has a bad experience I can't
refund that I can't give you 5% a coupon
off your next experience right because
you die it's like it's it's anyways it's

[01:01]
you die it's like it's it's anyways it's
very high stakes but I love the silver
tsunami space so let me give you some
data and my goal is to talk about a
silver tsunami idea every week it's kind
of my goal the over 65 age is going to
double by 2050 from 52 million today to
95 million wow so in the in under 30
years about 25 years we're going to add
another 40 million people to over 65 all
right allim in dementia you know what
that is those are the diseases where
people like lose memory they don't
recognize you anymore those are expected
to double from 6 million people to 13
million over over double by 2050 today
there's 52 dependents for every 100
working individuals by 2050 there's
going to be 77 dependents for every
hundred working
individuals all right so the silver
tsunami is real people are aging people
are getting older I highlighted the
Alzheimer's and Dementia because people
are forgetting more and more and it

[02:00]
are forgetting more and more and it
brings me to the thing that I am very
very interested in genealogical Services
now I get it anybody who's LDS and
listening to that is like oh of course
they bring up genealogy genealogy I am
doing it hey Brody Christensen calm down
okay keep
listening but for those who don't know
what genealogical services are those are
services that help you map your family
history not only who your parents were
about your grandparents and great
grandparents and great great
grandparents because if I were to ask
anybody listening question hey where was
your grandpa born theyd probably have to
think about it but they could probably
figure it out oh I think my grandpa was
born in Massachusetts right now if I ask
them where's that written down 99.9% of
them would say nowhere it's all just
oral right it's just passed down from
generation to generation oh Yep this is
when Grandma Smith came over on the
Mayflower that was a really stupid
example but gen genealogical services so
people actually taking family history

[03:01]
people actually taking family history
digitizing it is expected to grow from
about $5 billion a year this year to $6
billion by 2023 or 2033 so in the next
eight years it's going to more than
double and for anybody listening
genealogical Ser Services would be like
family history.org family tree 23 and me
right telling you your your DNA Etc so
tons of opportunity here here's what I
think the product is I think that
capturing stories is an incredible
opportunity right now you have the older
Generations like they always do pass
away they they have stories and
everybody has these stories the ones
that Grandpa always tells about growing
up in Southern Florida and how he got
you know my dad my dad tells this story
he grew up in Brazil and when he was 5
years old he got captured by the Indians
and they were about to cook him he was
in a he was in a pot they put him in
this pot they started boiling the water
they were about to cook him and his dad
shows up with the mayor of the town and

[04:02]
shows up with the mayor of the town and
the mayor of the Town talks to the Chief
and they end up trading a parakeet and a
bow and arrow to get my dad back and
that's the story a real story it's a
real story I don't know if it's true I
don't think it's true but it's a
freaking amazing story
right but it's like you know we call him
Dee that's what we that's that's what we
call for Grandpa and it's like that's an
amazing story and my dad has tons of
those and and everybody's parents has
have interesting stories like that but
when my dad dies what happens to that
story maybe I tell it to my kids and
maybe it's a crazy enough story that it
gets passed down to a couple different
Generations but at some point it gets
lost so I think right now there's a huge
opportunity to capture these stories and
there are tools like never before to be
able to capture them in two specific
ways way number one digitally via video
right we're on Riverside right now we
have cool cameras we have cool lights we
could go in and interview these people
and capture their story it's very
similar to what story worth is doing
with the emails except you would

[05:01]
with the emails except you would
actually have a video right way number
two which I love artificial intelligence
and digitize records so many people have
journals now there are many people who
don't have journals but many people have
journals how do you get those digitized
well in the in the past you haven't been
able to read handwriting and but now
there are tools that allow you to take a
picture and then using technology
digitize that and transcribe it so I
think those are two huge opportunities
to create before I keep going and just
keep talking does it make sense what I'm
saying or am I just like rambling no I'm
I'm getting some ideas I'm loving it all
right so here are some here are some
ideas of things that you could turn into
products okay you could create a chat
bot for your grandma and grandpa some
people are gonna be weirded out by that
right because it's like Grandpa died 30
years ago I don't want to talk to him
but other people are going to be like
yeah I really want to I could really use
some advice from Grandpa right now Al so

[06:00]
some advice from Grandpa right now Al so
I thought you were going to say a
chatbot for Grandpa to tell his stories
to yeah yeah yeah I'm going to get there
that's capturing all of this stuff right
I'm talking about like endstate products
that could be created from capturing all
of these things so one is a chat bot for
family to talk to another one is you
could turn these interviews into like
podcasts and and use like actual good
lights actual cameras and then just have
episodes where you could watch Grandpa
Tell this story or Great Grandma tell
this story of the time that they made
the high school football team or that
they got shipped off World War II or
that they almost got sold to Indians in
the interior of Brazil you can create
books right like story worth kind of do
does that where you where you create
books and you can also create a service
where you digitize records for families
to capture these things so in my mind
like those are broad products that you
could create the way that you create
them would be through either capturing
video taking their records and
digitizing them creating a chatbot that
just prompts them with questions or the
email correspondent with something like

[07:00]
email correspondent with something like
story Worth right so like it's either
going to be video it's going to be
written it's going to be live with a
chatbot or you're going to be digitizing
things that's kind of those are kind of
the ways that you would that you would
capture it and so there are tools like
Adobe scan or micro Microsoft lens where
you can actually scan this stuff there
are handwriting ocrs where you can
Google Cloud Vision Amazon text track
that you can actually look at the
handwriting and transcribe it so once
it's transcribed digitally you can then
upload it to the llm so that it can read
you off this information like how cool
would it be to have a chat bot like for
my kids to be like where was great
grandpa Royce born great grandpa Royce
was born in Southern Florida defc
Springs you know like it just spits out
an answer instead of asking mom or dad
and then you would have even chatbot
development so open AI has opportunities
to now create chat Bots based off of
information that you feed it using
different gpts essentially so that's the
product and that is like the way that
you would get to the product in a
nutshell

[08:00]
nutshell
thoughts I love it so here are my ideas
that are coming to mind so do you
remember the company
rewind so rewind was interesting it's a
Silicon Valley startup they raised a
bunch of money it's a a Mac app it's an
iPhone app and it listens and it watches
everything you do on your computer what
you type what you look at it's like a
browser history for everything which a
lot of people are freaked out about I'm
not they're coming out with a piece of
Hardware any day now I'm like on the
wait list I pre-ordered it it's like 70
bucks and it's going to be a wearable
and it's going to listen to everything
that happens around you and then it will
send you a daily summary of and it will
recognize voices and it attribute
certain voices to their names it's
amazing and it's good like you could
just recall anything it's all going to
be there in an llm that you can talk to
super cool not an ad but what you could
do is you could piggyback on someone
like rewind and literally just resell
their

[09:00]
their
product as rewind for Elder people right
for for a different generation that
would never even hear about the company
and like you know you give it to your
Granda what what is this oh just just
put it on your shirt every morning and
just talk and just live your life and
tell stories and talk about World War II
and talk about your mission and talk
about all this and it's just going to be
on his schedule on his timetable or hers
it will just be recorded and it will be
there forever and it doesn't have to be
this formal thing he doesn't have to
write an email he can just talk to it
that is going to be one of my other
silver tsunami ideas that device and I'm
not even GNA like waste a bunch of time
but I have so many ideas around that
that I've been especially in healthcare
but I love that I love that idea here's
what I'm thinking for a distribution
idea many people don't know the
difference but there are like three
types of living places for the elderly
there are independent living facilities
well I mean yes a traditional home but

[10:00]
well I mean yes a traditional home but
let's exclude those things there are
independent living facilities there are
assisted living facilities and then
there are skilled nursing facilities it
does not matter that you know the
difference they are kind of different
but I would take I would do two things
thing number one I would get high school
kids to volunteer and I would go to the
assisted living facilities and I would
say we're going to be here once a week
we're just digitizing
records and so then the families or the
residents would bring those records and
they would just take pictures of them
upload it and and then you know and have
it for the families it could be a senior
project like you could even do it for
free I've been thinking about doing it
for free locally because I just think it
would be a really cool project to do for
these residents okay so that's thing
number one thing number two I would go
through either local photographers local
videographers because they have the
equipment they have the lighting they
have the cameras they have the
microphones and I would just say go
capture once a week stories and and go
to those assisted living facilities and
say we're going to be here Thursdays
from noon to 5 it's just story time and
it would allow these residents to come
put a mic on and tell their story that

[11:01]
put a mic on and tell their story that
the residents would love it because it's
one of the saddest things about these
facilities they don't get a lot of
visitors yeah and it's super freaking
sad because some of them yes they're
mind they're gone they have Alzheimer's
dementia they're not there but many of
them are still there but they just they
don't get to see their grandkids or they
don't get to see their friends anymore
because the level of care that they need
doesn't allow them to go out and and
visit with these people so you would get
a ton of people coming in and then you
could you would either have the facility
pay you as like an addon benefit of
staying at the facility or you would
have the family pay you or some type of
combination of both but you would
capture all of that package it up uh
really prettily and then give it out uh
and sell it either back to the families
back to the resident Etc or turn it into
some of these other products that we're
talking about like the chat bot Like A
Book Like a podcast that is such a good
idea do you think the owner of a
facility like this would be willing to
pay extra for a service like this if
they thought it they could fill more
beds million set them apart a million

[12:01]
beds million set them apart a million
what what is the value of one more
filled bed to a facility it depends on
the facility but if we're talking about
an assisted living facility that's going
to be like an extra $5,000 a month in
Topline revenue and then in a vacuum you
would say like oh you know 15%
online oh LTV like monthly profit how
many times how many
months oh I mean the the average day at
these assisted living facilities are 10
years
wow I didn't really long time yeah it's
a really really long time but the thing
I was going to say is like if you looked
at it on a vacuum and you're like oh
there's a 100 beds in this SK assisted
living facility and and I get $100,000
in Revenue a month and my profit is
$20,000 you're like oh okay it's $200 or
2,000 yeah $200 per bed per month profit
but if you add one more additional bed
it's not an additional $200 in profit
it's like an additional

[13:00]
it's like an additional
right everything already built into that
the problem would be proving to them
that it gets more resid in the door
right like they'll like the idea and the
concept so that's why I think you would
have to go through a distribution model
of of these like fremium upfront like
hey I'll do it for you I'll charge it to
the residents and we'll we'll be
exclusive but then once they see the
value and bringing people in it's like
okay cool yeah I'll pay you whatever you
want so here's what I think you do you
go find a facility that's willing to be
creative um you find of photographer
that's willing to be creative and you
offer this completely for free no
strings attached just to because you
want data so you say all right let me
get with your marketing person and
they're going to sell this when they're
talking to to these people they're going
to sell this service and let's say it's
for a year right for the next year we're
going to offer whatever it's called for
free and we're going to send you all the
data for free videos text whatever we're
going to record capture stories from
your dad or from your mom for free it's

[14:00]
your dad or from your mom for free it's
and that's just comes with the cost of
admission and it but what you need to
let us do you need to let us train your
marketing department to actually sell
this and then you need to allow us to
ask the the new customers that you get
for the next year if this played into
their decision at all that's it we're
just going to send them an email with
like a follow-up or two if they don't
respond that will give us data
transparently so we can go get a bunch
more customers like you that will pay us
a pretty penny so this is completely
free your only down side is we spend an
hour with your marketing
team yeah you know yeah that would be
genius I and I don't even think you need
a wait a year I think you're just like
right give us a month three months yeah
or just one month hey any any new
residents that move in after you've told
them this we'll send them this
blind survey and they can tell us and if
we see like no we didn't care about that
great but if we start seeing people
comment about that I think that that
would be a major thing maybe I'm over
indexing on it and maybe I'm hokey but
dude there's something something just so
beautiful about capturing these stories

[15:01]
beautiful about capturing these stories
like when I worked in hospice and you
have you know that you're actively dying
there are people who are wanting to
capture stories I had this guy who had
ALS he had some young kids and he just
captured him reading stories to them
that was it he just he's like reading
his stories he's in his 30s we paid for
that right but now those kids for the
rest of their life are going to have
like Dad reading them this story is
freaking it's it's incredible and there
are millions of these stories that just
pass away because people die and they
didn't pass it on I'm pontificating here
I think it's a cool business I think you
can make a lot of money but I also just
think it's a freaking cool service to
have for people to be able to refer back
to that you could feel really good about
going into these facilities and selling
something that you feel like is actually
bringing joy to people you know what I
mean and not just like oh I found this
cool Arbitrage and I was able to make
money because I right right right you
know sell sold the Delta between these
two it's just it's just so cool and I
think that there could be a framework
here where You could argue that this is

[16:00]
here where You could argue that this is
a vitamin and not a painkiller right
what do you mean I know that that's an
analogy but I always forget like what
that means yeah a painkiller is just
like something you absolutely have to
have it's just a lifesaver one so you
see people these gurus like sell
painkillers not vitamins vitamins are
nice to have okay so you can make the
argument that ah this isn't a great idea
because it's just a vitamin it's not a
painkiller and let's say it is okay
first of all there are a lot of people
selling vitamins making a lot of money
let's say it is let's own that for the
purposes of this analogy what is the
framework for selling vitamins
well I I could just picture someone like
myself it's like yeah I really want
those stories okay cool cool it's $500 a
month oh I don't know if I want them
that much you know but it's like $50 a
month you don't make any money so it and
I'm just completely making up these
numbers so don't focus on the numbers
but maybe the the framework for selling
vitamins is you've got to go through
like the person writing the check has to

[17:00]
like the person writing the check has to
be someone that's not as vested in the
outcome and so if you go to the the the
kids of these people that will be an
assisted living and try to sell it to
them directly you might get that like ah
very nice to have very cool to have just
I'm not going to pull the trigger on
this all right if you are watching this
clip right now you are watching this on
YouTube and if you are a fan of podcast
please check out my podcast while you're
at it because sometimes I have podcasts
that aren't on YouTube and sometimes I
have YouTubes that aren't on podcasts so
check out the ker office on any podcast
platform or you can go to TKO pod.com
also my newsletter will throw that in
there there are no ads It's weekly it's
different content than my podcast and
YouTube newsletter. chrisj cerner.com
You'll see the link and we'll see you
there but if you take that same person
in the room with the marketer at the
assisted living facility and they're
like we offer this and it's included in
the price they're like I'm in like they
would choose that place because of it
even if they wouldn't go out of their
way to pay extra for it does that make
sense yeah that makes a lot of sense
that is that's really interesting
framework yeah yeah yeah so it's like if

[18:01]
framework yeah yeah yeah so it's like if
you do cut a deal one month 3 months or
whatever just to get data from the
facility the data may tell you that it's
not moving the needle at all the surveys
are telling you people didn't really
care okay if that's the case no big deal
then you just pivot your strategy and
don't go through the facilities and go
directly through the people maybe you
record their stories for free and then
reach out to their kids send them a
sample right like use AI to say hey find
me three highlights like make a Sizzle
reel from this 30 minute story about
World War II send it for free to the kid
and it's kind of like when you walk into
a theme park and hey come here hey kter
family come here let's get a picture hey
$74 buy this picture it's it's like an
equivalent of that right you send them a
scissor reel and like once they see it
the same person that's not willing to
pay for it once they see a highlight
clip they're like oh bye by now byy now
it's already done you know this will be
like the last thing and then I we're
taking a lot of time on this idea but an
offshoot of that would be like I could
go to a facility right now and be like

[19:01]
go to a facility right now and be like
let me build out a room for you small
room like this where it's like it's like
an assisted living podcast
studio and they could go at any time you
just train a staff member on like hey
this is how you turn on the mic this is
how you turn on the camera right and
they could just go on their own
time you don't need a photographer
that's the expensive part right yeah you
just need the one time cost of the
equipment you literally have a button
that's like this big and it's like press
red button then you have a sensor in the
door where when they leave it they don't
even have to turn it off it's like the
same sensor that you have on the light
switch that turns on the light when it
detects movement when there's no
movement it stops recording so like the
there are podcast studios here in Boise
that that do this you know Nathan Barry
with convert K or kit now I I just go in
there and they're ready to go and they
have an employee there who like gets me
set up really quickly but I have my
Riverside account and I go dude each re
resident could have a Riverside account
like oh Mrs Jones Come On In yep I'll

[20:00]
like oh Mrs Jones Come On In yep I'll
log you into your Riverside account and
you're ready to go and they sit down and
it's built out and they just tell their
story and then when they're done they
have employees at these assisted living
facilities the employee will just you
know whatever hit stop or they'll close
the lights off boom and they're out like
it's frictionless they don't have to
have somebody like according to the
schedule if I was going to spend some
money and invest and actually do it I
would do that I would spend like five
grand build out a cool little podcast
studio and then really test the idea I
think that would be dude I'll do you one
better I'll do you one better go on I
was just I was just listening to a
podcast where this guy invented like a
pod if you wanted to go on a conference
call or something in an office open
Office office setting it's too loud he
invented these pods well I don't even
know what podcast it was but they sold
$50 million worth of these things and
literally all it was was like a 2 by two
pod that was soundproof with a fan right
so it didn't get all hot and stuffy in
there and it was just a quiet place for
them to have calls or work and now and
like these are all over Wei works like

[21:00]
like these are all over Wei works like
this is no longer unique right you just
take one of those you just buy a pod and
you could put it off off the side of the
lobby you don't need to build out a
whole room how much they they just go in
there they sit down in the only like
you're eliminating all the variables
right there's just one chair the the mic
is a fixed well and the facility is not
like well I'm giving up a room now ah I
could have been renting that yeah yeah
yeah just a little pod they have to sit
in one place the mic is in one place
they push a big red button you don't
even need to ask their name the facility
is going to have head shots of all these
people right so you just tie that up to
the facial recognition of who's talking
and you could link it up automatically
on the back end they can just start
talking and tell stories and your cost
would be zero you'd have an upfront cost
maybe five grand but your ongoing cost
is just some software couple hundred
bucks a month so for anybody listening I
freaking love this idea and I'm
volunteering you for this as well Chris
if there's somebody who who like loves
it or is like trying to build this out
like me I'm serious Chris CH like I

[22:01]
like me I'm serious Chris CH like I
would I would be just because I have a
lot of connections and distribution on
the assisted living facility side but I
know myself like I'm not gonna do this I
I think it's a great idea but I I know
I'm not going to do it oh this is so
good you don't even need a person you
just drop off a pod one day you plug
everything in you connect it to the
internet and you walk away and
everything's uploaded to the cloud all
the videos the one thing you'd have to
figure out is getting the person
comfortable talking cuz they may feel
weird like who am I talking to there's
no picture or maybe it's just me you
know what I mean
like prompt exactly right started with
some type of prompt I I that part I
don't know but I'm sure you could kind
of figure that out that could just be
like chat GPT like just the audio
feature like you could just have a like
an an overarching prompt where it's like
all right you are in a pod right now an
83 year-old wants to tell stories but
they don't know where to start right so
you're going to prompt them to tell
stories like you could just use an audio

[23:00]
stories like you could just use an audio
version of that well because Chachi PT
has that now where you can talk to it
the worker just sets it up and be like
all right Gary Gary sits down Grandpa
Gary sits down you're ready to go chat
gbt Gary is ready and and it's built
into the prompt it's like hello Gary
glad you're here why don't you tell me a
story about where you know where you
grew up and then Gary just starts
talking because then it it at least
mimics the having a conversation I think
that would be really anyways you could
solve that piece but I do think that'd
be one piece that You' have to kind of
figure out that's a great idea I I
really love that idea thank you Chris
I'm very I'm very proud of
[Laughter]
you all right I got one so New Year's
coming new year equals new business
opportunities new side hustle
opportunities new year new year that's
right so hold on a second hold on a
second we need to start listening to
mamor next year is going to be better
than this year yeah Windsor featuring m
more there it is next year's gonna be

[24:01]
more there it is next year's gonna be
better than this year next year's GNA
such a good song okay so I stole this
idea but I'm implementing in a different
way Justin Ms he's kind of a Twitter
business Guru he did this a year or two
ago with some friends and family if
you're watching on YouTube look at this
right here what is that that is a CGM a
continuous glucose monitor okay oh are
you biohacking now I've used this before
this is my second go around with this
but I'm a bio I got an or ring I got I
got my choros watch you're a by
Guy also I did want to give a shout out
to my mom Cindy who listens to this
podcast I love her very much and she's
written hundreds of journals she has 10
tens of thousands of pages of
handwritten journals and I'm very
excited to digitize all those in an llm
dude she's per she's the perfect for it
I know and I told her I'm going to do
this and she loves the idea I could ask
like hey what was Cindy's worst day hey
what was life like the day I was born
like she's written about all these

[25:00]
like she's written about all these
things yeah well hey June 2nd 1992 what
was that day like in Cindy's life that's
incredible I know well dude and I have
the list of tools I mean I'd like listed
them off but trans biscus Amazon TCH
track is really good I can't believe how
freaking good it is anyways sorry keep
going with you what rewind is doing with
this wearable is like what my mom has
been doing for 60 years writing in a
journal like not that we we should no
longer write in journals there's
something very different and intentional
about that it doesn't replace that Holy
but being able to ask questions to
something based on what you did in your
life that's going to be the
standard kids being born today that's
all they'll know I I already previewed
this in medical care to to be able to as
a physician you don't have your chart
anymore you're just like all right Mrs
Johnson is a 95y old female 120 pounds
BMI of you know and they just start
listing these things they don't need to
write that down anymore you know how
much time that's going to save it's now
going to be here and then transcribed to
the iic medical record anyways that in

[26:00]
the iic medical record anyways that in
and of itself will allow us to care for
that booming population that I just
named going from 52 to 95 million just
the productivity Savings of no longer
having to enter into your EMR will allow
us to get there I love it anyways all
right so I have a continuous glucose
monitor and it monitors my glucose
continuously like we we get it right
it's mostly used for diabetics but I
don't get it so it's usually used for
diabetics why are you using it that's
what I don't get it's a great question
my friend thank you thank you for
softball me so by the way I cannot
believe you have it because you freaking
hate needles I do but it doesn't hurt it
doesn't hurt like legitimately I I don't
know I hate needles but legit I don't
know how it doesn't hurt but like you
have this little thing and you you pop
it in there and you don't even feel it
so all right so if you look at my phone
right now you see this I have this handy
little app you can't really see it but

[27:00]
little app you can't really see it but
it says scan sensor and every eight
hours I have to do this and I think it's
like an NFC chip and it's not working
nft it's an
nft oh this what nfts were
for it's literally not scanning for the
first time ever but anyway you scan it
and it will go past the last eight hours
and show you what your blood sugar has
been and then you can attribute it to
what you ate or drank around that given
time because when blood sugar spikes we
get Cravings we get hungrier and we
overeat okay that's what happens when
our blood sugar spikes so there's all
kinds of tactics and strategies out
there where like if you eat carbs you
want to pair it with protein you don't
want to eat carbs all by themselves you
always want to balance it with protein
or before you eat a meal you want to eat
a little protein beforehand and it'll
help you feel more full like a a hard
boiled egg or some almonds right or if
you eat a big like a very unhealthy meal
maybe full of carbs or sugar if you walk
for like 15 15 minutes afterwards just
casually it will have like a 70%

[28:02]
casually it will have like a 70%
decreased effect on your blood sugar
levels really yeah it's a total hack and
so having a continuous glucose monitor
helps you learn more about your body so
even if you only wear it for a few
months you'll know forever that like ah
that Diet Coke it's not supposed to
spike my blood sugar but it does and it
everyone's different like everyone's
bodies are a little different so some
things are constant for everyone and
some things are unique to you so I love
it because it just helps me learn and
understand and and not make such
terrible decisions okay yeah okay all
right so Justin Mays he did a challenge
at the beginning of last year the year
before where he went to his friends and
family and said hey order a continuous
glucose monitor we'll all wear the same
type we'll all track our levels together
pay me
$1,000 you've got to keep your blood
sugar in a range for three months
straight maybe you have like one or two
like you know fibs where you can mess up
without any penalty but if you don't
like if you if you screw up and you eat

[29:01]
like if you if you screw up and you eat
a brownie I keep your $1 thousand if you
go all one two or three months while
staying in this range I give you all of
your money back it's just an
accountability piece that went really
well I don't know what the percentage of
what the percentage was of people that
did it successfully versus failed but I
think this could be an interesting side
hustle and you're just using math to
your advantage and it depends on the
type of person that you're working with
but it doesn't have to be with a Contin
glucose monitor it could just be like a
new year Health Challenge where everyone
puts money into a pot and there's
something something where you don't have
to be honest like you can just use Tech
to hold everyone accountable you're
sharing your numbers and you're just a
like you're going to be healthier
because of it so that's just a win no
matter what B you're banking on people
failing and you make money that
way is your minds me of remember project
Skyfall no Sky Drop Sky Drop sorry
freaking oh the the7 movie when the

[30:03]
freaking oh the the7 movie when the
sky yeah Sky Drop the treasure hunts and
like oh dude that' be so cool to put
together treasure hunts it kind of
reminds me of that idea because
effectively you are becoming the
accountability partner for them and you
so you could do it as a person or you
could probably build out a platform for
it but I I do like that idea because
people want two things people want to
get better and people want an
accountability partner like they may not
say it or they may be like oh that's
kind of stupid but we suck we suck at
holding ourselves accountable we adhere
much more to things if we have somebody
helping us stay accountable so I I
really like the that framework of
becoming somebody's accountability
partner would it just be around Health
items or could it be anything no so it's
the same concept that I talked about a
couple weeks ago with like a course
based a newsletter based course right
you pay into it you get all your money
back out if you do the things you know
and so at the end of it like at the end
of this one if you win then you paid
nothing and you're healthy at the end of

[31:01]
nothing and you're healthy at the end of
the other one if you win you get all
your money back and you have a thriving
business it's just like it's fair it's
fair all around it's funny it's like
Insurance almost where you'd have to get
good at underwriting it you're like okay
I need to get my Actuarial scientist on
this to make sure I know what the
probability of people not completing the
challenge is going to be because if
everybody does it you go stand outside
the casino and just sell all those
people
but but if everybody does it you don't
make any money you know what I mean
that's a very weird that's a weird
business model you still can though but
wait there's more go on so I'm GNA do
this with my newsletter subscribers this
challenge specifically that I'm talking
about I haven't sent an email about it
but even if they're completely
successful I will make $100 because I'm
going to use an affiliate link and they
all have to use the same CGM continuous
glucose monitor that's a genius way for
you to monetize
it's genius and the reason it's genius

[32:00]
it's genius and the reason it's genius
is because you're doing something that
you love to do and like you're getting
people to come along with you that's
freaking genius no one really pays for
it like I get $100 but that's paid for
by the company and if they do the thing
they don't pay for it exactly you're not
just selling them a product that's like
hey Chris I think your audience would be
a really good fit for you know their
Millennials and their mid-30s and
they're buying a house and insurance
life insurance would be really good it's
like no you're doing something that I
man I I really really like that
monetization framework for you because
you hate monetizing you've had lots of
opportunities to monetize you've got
almost a million followers across all of
your Social platforms you get tens of
millions of views every single month and
you don't monetize because it makes you
feel gross like right for for years I'd
been pushing you that's one of the
reasons I got on Twitter is because I'd
be like dude you can make money doing
this you could do this you could do this
and you're like all right like if you
want to do that go for it I'm not doing
that with my stuff I think that's a
that's a genius way sorry I'll get off

[33:00]
that's a genius way sorry I'll get off
my no I I think it's the same
personality trait that I was just
texting you about an hour ago where like
if I'm late I have anxiety because
people are waiting for me if someone
else is late I have anxiety because I'm
waiting for someone and it's just like
that's why I hate being late I don't
like being late I think that same
principle applies to monetizing because
if I just start Shilling ads that are
not relevant to people it's not
something that they're going to buy
anyways then I'm wasting their time it's
as if they're waiting for me that make
sense it does and this brings up a
bigger point to me this isn't
necessarily a business idea this is just
a philosophy that I think everybody
needs to think about because if you want
to get into business I wouldn't pick the
thing that you think is going to make
you the most money I wouldn't I think
that that's the wrong way to go about it
and I know you know Nick Huber is always
posting like don't follow your passions
that's stupid
advice there's there's some truth to
that but I just dude I hate his stuff
recently it is just all rage bait
anyways you need to find things that
you're passionate about that you really
really like because the grind is real

[34:01]
really like because the grind is real
when you decide to launch that business
it's going to get freaking hard and if
you have no passion for it if you're not
excited about it if it's not something
that you really believe in selling
you're not going to stick with it yeah
so like find where your comfort zone is
asking for money for you you don't like
selling ads and you've embraced that so
like okay you've got to figure out other
ways to creative like constraints Force
creativity right exactly because you're
going to continue to do this we need to
pay for our content we got to pay for
all the other stuff that we have the
overhead and that's fine so you just got
to be creative about it I think more
people need to spend time thinking
before they hop into something about
what they are and what they are not
passionate about what they are and what
they are not okay with when it comes to
business because they spend too they
spend far too much time on how much
money they're going to make and far too
little time on how it's going to affect
their psyche and their soul that I know
that sounds stupid and woooo but it is
so freaking true you're going to quit
what you're doing if you don't like it
you're going to go back to a job yeah
right so I'm going to agree with you but

[35:00]
right so I'm going to agree with you but
I put a Twist on it so I've gone like
over the last 15 years starting
businesses I've gone back and forth in
that follow your passion don't follow
your passion that's like a big
polarizing topic so I completely agree
with you follow your passion if you want
to love what you're doing there's you
probably have enough passions to where
you could monetize at least one of them
right but also be willing to eat crap
for a while right maybe that business
you start that is profitable just sucks
because you have to sell and you hate
selling or you have go door to door and
you hate that or you have to manage
people and you hate that like there's
also an element to just be willing to
eat crap for a while all right to get to
what your passion is so there's one
aspect the other aspect is one of my
missions with all the content I put out
is to get people to look at things
differently and to see things
differently and to find Opportunities
and more things and to like fall in love
with business and business ideas because
that's what I've done and so I don't
pick ideas based on passion I'm
passionate about the idea itself about

[36:00]
passionate about the idea itself about
business itself about Commerce that's my
passion so whether it's porta-potties or
software or an agency it makes no
difference to me because the passion is
like like it's way further up the funnel
than that does that make sense it does
make sense I have two things I'm gonna
say the first thing is you have to have
a ven diagram and there are three
aspects to the V diagram but most of the
time people people only focus on two the
two people most of the time focus on and
for those who don't know a vend diagram
is like two circles and then where they
overlap is where you want to focus the
two things that people focus on the most
are what I like doing and what I'm good
at right so there if there's overlap in
something that I'm passionate about and
what I'm good at that could be a
business right but there's the third
circle in that vend diagram which is
what I can charge for right so those
three circles what I can charge for what
I'm good at what I'm passionate about
they have to overlap otherwise like I
don't think you should get into the
business but everybody can find that I
think everybody could find their ven

[37:01]
think everybody could find their ven
diagram of that the second thing I would
say is you and I have talked about this
a lot oh Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk and
Bill Gates they've just hyperfocused on
one thing they've just hyper focused on
one thing it's their one thing and
they're hammering at home I don't do
that I'm I'm 2 ADHD Etc you and I love
the ideation of business because it's
like it's the game of business I think
Warren Buffett is similar to that he's a
capital allocator it's not like he's
like he's just the insurance guy or he's
just the Bank of America guy like he
loves the game of business as well and
he's putting money in different places
so I don't think it's bad that you
haven't necessarily quote unquote
followed your passion like Oh I'm a
wrestler I'm gonna go into a wrestling
business no you love playing the game
right like you like figuring out how to
get somebody to buy and that's a passion
in and of itself that's fine you just
have to do the work it's taking you a
long time taken me a long time to like
do the work to understand okay cool this
is my V diagram passionate about good at

[38:01]
is my V diagram passionate about good at
can make money at people need to do the
work and understand kind of where their
passions lie agree and and when it comes
to that Circle of the vend diagram like
what you can charge money for what the
world needs a lot of people just don't
know that they can charge money for
certain things or that they can monetize
certain things and that's another thing
that I deliberately intentionally try to
do is show people like anything is
monetizable anything is scalable you can
monetize anything but they just don't
have ideas they don't know how to get
there but if they can kind of change
rewire how their brain works then
they'll see opportunities in everything
I totally agree all right Nick it's time
for Marry date or kill we've got five
ideas that we talked about this week and
last week we've got the live music idea
inspired by Nashville we've got the
local email newsletter idea that you
pivot into uh a high ticket monthly
service you've got the Facebook groups
automation idea where you play middleman
between someone that wants leads someone
that has leads you've got the the
ancestry.com genealogical idea where you

[39:00]
ancestry.com genealogical idea where you
put a pod in an assisted living facility
and charge either the residents or the
assist living facility and then you got
the biohacking idea biohacking challenge
as a service where you at with these
Mery dat or kill dude I this is I think
this might be the hardest week that
we've ever had in ranking these these
were freaking good ideas this week these
are good ideas we're really smart
people're really smart I'm good-looking
right I feel like really good I mean
yeah like in some
countries all right I'm going to give
here the first two that are in no man's
land all
right the
newsletter and the live local music
those are no man's land for me I'm like
okay I don't feel strongly one way or
the other all
right Mary I just love the silver
tsunami idea of going to assisted living
facilities and capturing stories I love
that idea so I would marry that idea I
would date the Facebook group email

[40:02]
would date the Facebook group email
automation I think that's an incredible
idea I think there's a couple different
ways you could monetize it and it's
easily
monetizable and then I would kill
biohacking that all makes sense to me I
mean we're almost the exact same there's
one difference between us so I 80% agree
with you no man's land for me email
newsletter idea and biohacking okay
biohacking because
okay anything can be scalable anything
for sure you could do this as a service
you could help other people do this but
it's kind of a gimmick it's a way to
make a little money harder to scale
email no man's land but that's just
because it's high competition it's a
great idea but it would just take a
while right automation you're
saying the for the news local
specifically the sorry the newsletter
yeah yeah because it takes time to build
a newsletter yeah yeah yeah takes time
agree okay No Man's Land Mary ancestry

[41:00]
agree okay No Man's Land Mary ancestry
absolutely 100% love that idea I don't
care that you got to pay five grand for
these pods I don't care that it's hard
to sell into assisted living facilities
my love for this idea outweighs both of
those things okay okay don't care don't
even come at me with it I don't care
date Facebook group automation I really
really love that idea because I think
you could scale it quite quickly your
costs are almost nothing you just got to
make some phone calls you got to marry
some parties together that should be
marry but it's just it's high it's high
competition I know it's a hard week and
and then the kill is live music like
it's just like I'm not an events guy I'm
not an organizer I'm not an extrovert
someone could do it make a lot of money
but events are hard Logistics is hard
I've been burned on Logistics before
Okay so we've we both killed different
ideas but I think we killed them for the
same reason which is like I killed
biohacking because I'm like there's only
a small percentage of people that could
actually do this you're one of them
right it's like have a large audience
like that's where it makes sense I think
you could do it with a neighborhood or a

[42:01]
you could do it with a neighborhood or a
friend group or I don't think you have
to have an audience but I see what
you're saying yeah yeah you could but
then anyways I I think that's a that's a
business that's hard to get up and
running and then I I agree with you the
live local music would be really
logistically hard I love the idea of it
but that would just be a really
logistically hard business yeah it what
I'm curious to hear I want to hear from
people this this week which one would
you marry which one would you date which
one would you kill why yeah so if you're
on YouTube comment what would you marry
dat or kill are we are we aligned here
or not all right what you think please
share it with a friend and we'll see you
next time on the ker office
