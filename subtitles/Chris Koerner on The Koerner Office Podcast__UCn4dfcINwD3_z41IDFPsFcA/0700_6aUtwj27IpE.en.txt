[00:00]
there is no excuse for you to not be able to build
something right now i just had a call with a guy
that's selling a $7,000 a month service and this
is a service that anyone could do automations as
a service AI automations i met a kid this
week and he's like I sold my first company
and I have eight duplexes and then I have kind
of a side business that is showing people how
to implement automations i have 140 clients so
I'm like "Wait a second you're making 16 grand
a month passively why the freak are you here?"
and he's like "Honestly I just want a steady
paycheck and to feel like I'm safe and I'm just
going to make bets on all these other things." It
blew my mind he's 24 years old and it's all
automated could you imagine having AI when
you were 24 yeah I can because right now I'm feel
like a kid in a candy store and everything's free
nick has it ever been easier to do mass outbound
outreach to people that you're trying to sell
something to no never been easier we have
so many tools AI tools one prompt few clicks
instantly lenless GMass you can send hundreds
and thousands of cold emails right ai calls

[01:01]
ringless voicemail drops text messages right
we are getting inundated with sales messages
and as marketers we're inundating others with
sales messages correct correct all right so you
got to stand out more more than ever so I just
had a call with a guy that's selling a $7,000
a month service to Fortune 500 companies and he's
doing it exclusively through three things are you
ready mhm and this is a service that anyone could
do it's automations as a service AI automations
stuff that a lot of people listening to this
are already doing or playing with themselves
but ironically people at Fortune 500 companies
have no idea about so he's doing three things
he has a really good pitch in his cold email
okay he only sells in person and he has a 33%
close rate in person and he has a guarantee as
part of his offer okay and this is a guarantee
that you and I have kind of seen floated out there
in different contextes but not like this so he's

[02:03]
pulling from the Bramosi playbook he's got a good
offer got a really good offer but this it's a very
simple offer i guarantee so he says "I want to
meet with you for 30 minutes in person i promise
you I can find ways to save you so much more money
than what my service costs if I can't for whatever
reason if you don't want to be a customer of
mine I will donate x amount to a charity of
your choice." Really and there's a second part
to this he proactively tells them how young he
is and he's like in his 20s or 30 like early 30s
mid20s somewhere in there he's not insanely young
and he says that combo of being young yet offering
to donate money to a charity of their choice to
that market to like Fortune 500 white collar
workers just crushes and so he has a 33% close
rate $7,000 a month very very low churn what do
you think what's his offering he basically helps

[03:00]
save them money by automating tasks that they
have employees do so he'll go look at how many
jobs they have posted on LinkedIn and on Indeed
and basically say "Hey I'm not trying to like take
your jobs i'm trying to prevent you from having
to hire more people i want to sit down with your
employees in person face to face teach them how
to use AI but first I want to ask them questions
about their roles and responsibilities and use
that to build automations that will make them like
have superpowers in their role." So I'm not going
to go in there and say "Hey AI is going to replace
you." answer all these questions for me it's like
no answer all these questions for me and you're
gonna be a rockstar employee i met a kid this
week i say kid he's in in his mid20s who's doing
something very similar so I won't say the company
but I went and met with a kid who's an accountant
at a company we're having a conversation and
in the middle of the conversation we're talking
about AI and he's like "Yeah actually after I sold
my first company I decided to get more into AI."
I was like "Wait what you're an accountant here
what are you talking He's like "Yeah well I sold

[04:01]
my first company and I have eight duplexes that
we own and that income actually supports us and
then I have kind of a side business that is
showing people how to implement automations
into their companies specifically focusing on CPA
firms." I was like "What how many clients do you
have?" He's like "I have 140 clients." What what
is he charging this part blew my mind 50 bucks a
month oh dude listen to this 50 bucks a month and
he's providing accounting services he's automated
the whole process he's like "They love me we
automate accounting services." But then he also
upsells them for implementing automations right
so then he makes more money that way but just
the accounting services are also 8 grand a month
and he's like "These are sticky customers they're
not going away." I'm like "Wait a second you're
making 16 grand a month passively why the freak
are you here?" Like "Why are you an accountant at
this company?" And he's like "Honestly some stuff
happened with my dad when I was younger i saw how
rough it was for him." and a job is so important
to me i just want a steady paycheck and to feel
like I'm safe and I'm just going to make bets on

[05:04]
all these other things i was like it blew my mind
how simply he's 24 years old but just how simply
he apparently has acquired all these accounting
customers and it's all automated he's like I spend
an hour a week basically on this business so not
only has cold outreach become easier than it ever
has been but the ability to implement and like
actually do what you say you're going to do has
become easier than it ever has been and you get
people here who are just they're going into these
businesses and creating real money for themselves
like how much was this guy you interviewed making
a year i don't know i don't know how many
customers he had but he was doing really well
could you imagine having AI when you were 24 yeah
I can because I feel like it right now i'm I'm
feel like a kid in a candy store and everything's
free i'm in Willy Wonka's chocolate factory and he
says "Take all you can hold." I'm in a Mr beast
video where he gives him 10 grand to go in a
grocery store this is the best period of my life
i'm in my Renaissance era baby you are in replet 4
hours a day oh and I love every second of it what
I just said like not only has it never been easier

[06:05]
to do cold outreach but the ability to fulfill
has never been easier and that's where I think you
have like your superpower has always been on cold
outreach so juice that up a little bit okay you're
a little bit better at cold outreach now with AI
but now you can fulfill bro like the opportunities
are endless you can build literally anything you
want what did you build last week we were on Whole
Code Bros and you're like "Hey I have this idea."
And what did you throw up how to use AI how to use
ai.com unbundled subreddit yeah you got to log
in you got to submit ideas you You can vote on
them you can comment you built the whole website
and now you've got a community of people who are
contributing AI ideas it's like there is no excuse
for you to not be able to build something right
now it's insane so here's how this works i make
you free videos i actually know what I'm talking
about i have no greasy sales pitch at the end and
if you implement what I talk about you'll make a
lot more money and have a better life and all I
ask for in return is that you hit the subscribe
button and maybe even the notification bell just
like that thank you honestly it gives me like as

[07:02]
cheesy as it sounds I get tingles just thinking
about it because up until six months ago what did
I do if I had an idea that was technical that
required some code I'm going to get Justin my
brother-in-law on the phone justin is extremely
bright he's a 10x developer he's busy he makes
a ton of money he's like "Yeah I'll get to you
when I can get to you." Because he has worked on
so many projects for me you us that just never
materialized and he put ton of hours into them
now I don't have to bug Justin at I'm going to
his house in a couple weeks and we can just bro
down about disc golf i can build my own stuff now
if he were to see my code he'd probably laugh me
out of the room but I don't care cuz it works i
don't even know how to read my code where do I see
my code i don't know what is a computer the files
are in the computer are you my grandson i've got
some piggyback ideas all right okay so for those
new to the pod we like talking about piggybacking
which is instead of like starting from scratch and
finding your own customers fresh just plug into
another business and piggyback on their customers
in a non-competitive way for example I want to

[08:04]
start a stump grinding business let's go find
a bunch of homeowners no let's go find a bunch
of tree trimming businesses that are willing to
outsource all of their stump grinding on a weekly
basis right piggybacking 101 i've got two ideas
in one here and I'll just explain what people are
watching these are called fabric ceilings and
they're super popular in Greece and elsewhere
in Europe and I think they need to be here in
the US and here's how you should do it i call
it the piggyback method i've already done content
about people that install pergolas it costs like
8 to 12,000 to install a pergola but look how
they look they're ugly who wants that if I were
you I'd go find a dozen or two of these pergola
installation businesses and piggyback on them
say "Hey I install fabric ceilings on pergolas you
need to offer this as an upcharge i know how to do
it you upcharge a,000 bucks i have 200 of that for
you just for referring me and I'll do all the work
let's say your costs are 200 bucks your labor
takes a couple hours and you're making $200 to
$300 an hour to install something that objectively
looks awesome and that people would pay for so I

[09:00]
made a business plan for it right here what do you
think dude i think it's amazing like literally I
just got a quote last week to have a pergola on
our deck $15,000 and like what are you doing and
we want it now i I wouldn't do that because we
want it for the winter and like the snow's just
gonna like wreck that but I think it's an amazing
piggyback method yeah for those only listening a
fabric ceiling is like it just looks all wavy it
blows with the wind it offers more shade it looks
really cool and it's something that's being done
in the Mediterranean but not really out west and
so bring something over there over here piggyback
with pergo installation businesses they make more
money you tap into their customer base bada bing
bada boom okay bada bang bad ma boom so Nick one
of our most popular hold bros episodes ever was
from July 10th episode 37 B2B stump grinding
for those just catching up we talked about
hypothetically B2B stump grinding then we did
a public experiment we called every tree trimming
business in Houston yada yada yada and this guy

[10:01]
Tyler and subsequently several others went out and
started B2B stump grinding businesses which as far
as we know wasn't a thing like stump grinding was
not a B2B type of business but now it is so you
could say we kind of invented a new industry but
I found a new I found a new B2B stump grinding for
us okay you ready i'm here for it dude yeah story
time so I went to my friend Ed's house you've met
Ed he just put in a pool and Ed is like me he's
kind of cheap he doesn't spend too much if he
doesn't have to and he used to be a home builder
so he knows a bunch of subcontractors and he can
get stuff done around the house very cheaply he
put in a pool nice pool not plain not extravagant
middle of the range middle of the pack pool little
slide little waterfall medium size and he like was
very prudent about what he spent on it what do
you think that thing costs $50,000 $150,000 oh
what yeah that's like going rate and that's like
a good price for a pool like that and you'd be

[11:02]
like "Yeah it's nice." So I have a pool and it has
like a liner in it i don't even know what to call
it like acrylic it's like a proper pool that's
like a real pool what you have is a doughboy that
you You have what's called above ground that's
what they have in Alabama no so 150 grand and
Oh my god in all seriousness 2019 you could get
that pool for 70 grand you cannot get a pool in
Texas under 100 grand you just It's not going to
happen okay so that's the that's the backstory
then I'm talking to our our business partner
James Fast Tree Care and he says "Chris I just
met this guy or he operates excavators he doesn't
even own an excavator." And for those listening
excavator it's a it's a freaking It's a bucket
truck excavator hardly know her you know it's
a big digging machine okay and uh I rented one to
dig a culvert it's a lot of fun i'd never used one
before i just hopped on it started pulling levers
and I dug a bunch of holes in the ground anyway
this guy has a B2B pool digging business he has no
website he has no Google business profile he has a

[12:06]
phone number and a handful of relationships with
pool companies okay pool company goes into Mary
Jones's house and says "Yeah 150 grand for this
pool." Cool can you show me an itemized invoice
sure digging $5,000 this guy hey hey I got a job
for you five grand you good for it yeah sure he
goes to United Rentals he picks up the excavator
he pays about $700 for it for the day these things
cost about 70 80 grand to buy which you can
finance them and lease them and he goes there
for about four hours digs out a pool he's on his
merry little way $5,000 what are we talking about
here dude so who's he piggybacking off of pool
companies pool companies just sub everything out
then they're going to go find a framing company to
put the forms in all the 2x4s then they're going
to find a plaster company then they're going to
find a landscaping company to put all the tiles
in around it then they're going to you go to go
buy the slide from a third party they're just
like home builders they're just subcontracting
everything out and the homeowner just it's just

[13:04]
another line item so they're not super price
sensitive the pool companies aren't okay first
of all I love this idea because effectively what
Tyler did is he bought a stump grinder and then
rented it out that's effectively what he did right
like these tree trimming businesses don't want to
spend $20,000 or whatever the No it's more than
that $50,000 on a stump grinder and so they are
renting it out from Tyler and Tyler goes and and
he fixes it this is the same problem right these
pulled contractors they don't want to have an
excavator so they're renting it out from this
guy i really like this idea of piggybacking and I
was doing it while you were talking piggybacking
off of high ticket home services so literally as
you were talking this is what I did i asked Chad
GBT "What are some high ticket home purchases like
a pool and tree trimming?" So pools it names tree
trimming landscaping redesign and hardscaping so
this is just off the top of my head all right go
find contractors that do the landscaping and maybe
you're the guy that they don't want to run it to

[14:02]
the dump so you're like "Hey dumpster rentals
right what's the big ticket purchase item that
they don't want to do maybe it's disposal deck and
patio installation it's gonna Dude that's going to
be disposal as well that would be an amazing
one to piggyback off of you just contact all
these contractors and say "Hey I have a dumpster
i'll come pick up your old deck." Don't even buy
a dumpster do what I did last weekend when we
took down our bubble in the back over the tennis
court we just had two trailers and then loaded the
trailers up and took them to the dump so you could
start just cash flowing by getting a trailer you
know having a hitch on your truck but then you buy
a dumpster anyways that would be really fencing
installation how could you piggyback off a fencing
installation you could um have like augur as a
service like digging the post holes yeah that's
I've hired guys to come out and do that like I'll
get my fence repaired and I'll plant trees at the
same time so it's like hey 350 bucks come out and
dig 13 holes for me dude that could be the same
for landscaping let's like if somebody's going and
doing a big backyard landscaping having somebody
come out with a bobcat or some just to grade the
land right because they don't want to have the

[15:04]
expense of that bobcat like okay cool i'll be the
guy who actually comes out and moves dirt around
let's remind our listeners of what Tyler the
stump rental the stump grinder did he bought a
$60,000 stump grinder but he he financed it his
payment's like $450 a month his truck financed
450 a month his trailer financed parking he pays
like 250 bucks a month for a lot he doesn't have a
building he like he works from home like you don't
have to have $60,000 to start a business like this
well and the way to validate it is so simple
it's the same way that Tyler did it you scrape
a list of the type of contractors that you want
to piggyback off of you find a market to test it
in see if there's demand there if there's demand
there before you spend a dollar yeah before you
spend a dollar see if there's demand there and
then if there's demand you actually jump into
it you actually start booking jobs and doing it
that's what Tyler did and in his first month I
can't remember what he did in his first month i
think he did like $7,500 his first month he did
9,000 his first and then like 20,000 his second
right and just two months ago I don't know what

[16:04]
he did last month but just two months ago he did
$30,000 he's making good money as a soloreneur
and hopefully he expands but these are the home
services piece in my mind is such a freaking cool
opportunity to piggyback off of these companies
that have effectively distribution dude this is
mind-blowing gen Z and millennials are the most
entrepreneurial generation we've ever seen check
this out according to like what metric i'm going
to tell you right now so there there was a recent
study I think that US Bank just published 36% of
Gen Z and millennials who are business owners plan
to acquire a business from a retiring owner only
54% of current owners though like have a formal
succession plan so that there's this gap in the
marketplace and I think there's a huge opportunity
right now for these individuals who are like
trying to figure out how do I take advantage
of AI to utilize AI to help them figure out how
to take advantage of it does that make sense what

[17:00]
I'm saying i know that's like super stupid and
meta but one more time for the ADHDers in the
back i'll say it a different way last year 72%
of business owners thought AI was going to play
an important role 2024 this year 87% a 15 point
swing right so like they're seeing the value very
surprising to me cuz isn't it i would feel like
there'd be like 25% of hold outs and they're just
gonna like out of pride ego whatever like no this
is just a fad but for that margin to cut in half
in one year is shocking to me it's insane but not
only that they're utilizing AI in their business
and from the report they're mainly utilizing it
as like a better search engine right so they're
like using Chat GBT whatever as a counselor so
to speak but I actually think there's a really
really good opportunity for them to use chat GPT
as a therapist and as like a business coach so I
went to chat GPT and I literally asked at this
prompt are you ready mhm you've seen people say

[18:03]
like the best way to use AI and to fix a prompt is
to use AI to fix your prompt this is the same way
like the best way to find an opportunity for you
to to take advantage of something is to use AI to
help you find that opportunity to take advantage
of something so we've talked about quizzes i'm
just going to bring this up really quickly but
I think that people need to start using AI as
an interactive conversational as opposed to just
hey I put this in and it spits it out and I think
that there's a market for people to create GPTs
very simply that enable the interaction does that
make sense what I said i think so it removes
friction so people don't have to think as much
about what to ask yeah all you have to do is give
it like create a a custom GPT that has a prompt
you could have a custom GPT that's like hey you're
helping this person decide on which business to
buy ask them these questions how much capital do
they have what's their experience and to anyone
listening that thinks that sounds too complex
you're literally just going into chat GPT you're
clicking projects you're creating a project with
instructions right that's literally all it is in

[19:03]
fact do you want me to share my screen all right
so I'm in chat GPT i'm here i have these are all
my GPTs over here i have projects blah blah blah
now people get overwhelmed because they think "Oh
GPT that sounds complicated." It's not complicated
it's literally just a saved prompt what I'll do
over here is I'll come to this business research
assistant and I'll just show you what this looks
like edit GPT and now I'm looking at what the GPT
is on the back end and you can see here I named it
here's a quick description and generates business
research blah blah blah but then I actually
created this this GPT assists users in drafting
a comprehensive business research document using
a structured approach and let me guess you use
Chad GBT to write its own instructions huh huh
i don't know did I correct huh yes that's exact
like I went to Chad GPT and I was like "Hey help
me write this prompt this is what I'm trying to
do and I want to create a custom GPT." It doesn't
even have to be like you can literally say just
that help me write a GPT prompt for finding the

[20:03]
best business use cases at a carnival you don't
like go do that and it will help you write this
prompt i literally just took it copied and pasted
it and now it tells the GPT exactly how to work i
hit update boom and now I have a business research
assistant so what I'm saying is you can do this
and sell it to people you can you can put it on
the GPT store within Chat GPT or you can sell it
as a rapper it doesn't matter but let's say that
you're really good at helping people understand I
don't know how to write a book okay I'm going to
go take my knowledge that's here in my head this
is the exact process for writing a book please
write a prompt for this that enables other people
to write books you throw it into a GPT and now you
have a custom GPT that you can share if you get it
approved in OpenAI store you can actually share
that GPT with people you can sell it or you could
just go to replet and say make a a very simple
chat window just a rapper with this prompt and
then you can share that anywhere 100% so my point
is it I wasn't trying to be overly technical with

[21:03]
it and it's not even a major idea it's just use
AI to help you identify what opportunities are
available to you like this kid right he's going to
Fortune 500 companies because apparently he has a
skill set with automation i would bet you could
approach Fortune 500 companies or or SMBs with
your skill set of cold outreach or somebody maybe
has a really good skill set with I don't know some
type of architecture but find whatever your skill
set is build a custom GPT around it and you can
actually sell that to help people find their own
opportunities i kind of love that you told me that
that CPA guy is only charging 50 a month i didn't
think you were going there but I think that people
get so partially our fault they get so hung up on
like a high ticket monthly recurring revenue right
we talk about it a lot that it's like I have
an automation agency i have a short form video
editing agency i have an outbound agency whatever
it's 2,000 a month 1,500 4,000 and they have a
really hard time getting customers they're like
"What is wrong what happened?" But this guy is
like "Okay I know what I'm offering it's very
very low lift hands off for me i'm going to

[22:05]
charge 50 bucks a month at enough customers that's
a six-figure fairly passive income but I'm going
to have these upsells once I get my foot in the
door they see me and trust me and know that I know
what I'm talking about they're going to buy all
kinds of stuff from me and so let's be patient so
video is cool but you know what's better long form
audio via podcast and my newsletter tkopod.com go
there to subscribe for free to my newsletter it's
one email a week very tactical and then go to my
audio podcast three episodes a week stuff like
this you're going to love it all free no sleazy
sales [ __ ] tkopod.com you might be listening
and think and you might be think this like this
kid doesn't know pricing that's what I thought i
was like "Oh he doesn't even know what to charge."
Oh that's cute that's cute he's dramatically under
undercharging right because how much is outsourced
bookkeeping a month in our experience hundreds
hundreds sometimes in the low thousands in my
experience it's like between a,000 and $2,000 a
month if you're doing it onshore if you're doing
it offshore you can do it for cheaper right and
so I asked him I was like "Dude do you even know

[23:03]
what people charge for this?" He's like "Yeah
about $1,200 a month." And I was like "Okay he's
not like he even knows what the pricing is and
like you just said he has purposely picked this
$50 price because he knows it's going to be sticky
for these customers and he can fulfill on it." It
blew my mind oh man I was having a conversation
earlier today and this guy asked me what my
approach is in starting a business which is a very
broad question but he's like "You want to rush to
monetization right that's what you talk about
Chris right get monetized as fast as possible."
And as he said that I kind of thought of a
framework and what I told him was it's not
about running towards monetization as fast as
possible it's about running away from friction
as fast as possible because that's all I'm
asking you to do this is more of a mind game
than anything right so when I tell you go get your
first dollar preferably from someone that isn't
related to you it's not so you can like get rich
faster it's because every second it takes for you

[24:01]
to get that first dollar is more friction slash
less mo momentum for you to actually do the thing
the higher likelihood that you'll just abandon
this whole entrepreneurship thing altogether you
need to keep the momentum going that is the most
important part of starting anything well how many
businesses have you started if it's 50 bucks a
month then it's 50 bucks a month i've started
about 80 businesses you started 80 businesses why
have you started 80 businesses it's because 75 of
them didn't reduce friction fast enough and you
moved on to the next thing i mean 75 is is too
much but you get you get my point right it's like
you're very good about no cut my losses no cut my
losses i'm out of here and and to your point it's
not about running towards monetization because I
think probably of those 80 businesses you started
75 of them did monetize the question was how well
did they monetize how quickly could you get to
scale were there margins there was Juice worth
the squeeze was the juice worth the squeeze right
and if you're trying to get into entrepreneurship
that's the whole goal as quickly as possible find
the one thing that you can be better than anybody

[25:01]
else at get there really fast and then exploit it
over and over and over and over again and the most
successful people do that they don't continue to
just test test forever yep all right can I bring
up an idea i got to hear what you got oh please
okay no go my dad's here he decided to drive
up like last minute yesterday we have a broken
sprinkler out front it's been broken for two weeks
i've been trying to get somebody out to the house
to fix it i know in my head that it's not hard to
fix sprinklers but I know in my heart that I am
not mechanically inclined at all so I've left it
and I've just been like waiting and now that my
dad's here he's helping me fix it and it's been
a lot of fun this week as well I started talking
to this guy on Twitter and for whatever reason I
started looking at his profile and can I show you
i'm going to share my screen really fast i promise
this all makes sense this is his business so what
I'm looking at is metal shop fantasy camp so for
those listening what it is is it's a camp where
anybody can come and for 4 hours he just teaches

[26:02]
them how to make a couple of things there's a
cool video on the website and you can actually
look at what classes are here 1 hour introduction
to welding $130 per participant how to make a cube
$250 per participant steel bowl welding class
$190 right so he's got all these classes people
come in he's not certifying them so they can go
work on a building they're just learning how to
weld and so I had for funsies for funsies so I
had that conversation with him with this guy my
dad comes over and shows me how much of a man I
am not and it hit me how many men are there like
me who don't know how to change oil who don't
know how to change I don't know any electrical
in the house who don't know how to do a simple
project who don't know how to fix the sprinkler
heads but they have the means where they could
actually attend one of these fantasy camps to
learn how to fix things themselves maybe it's
a fantasy camp around landscaping maybe it's a

[27:02]
fantasy camp around like changing the oil but
they all get together they have an instructor
and it's it's one weekend again they're not
certifying them to start businesses but these
are local sort of chapters if you will where I
could just go and learn how to freaking fix a
sprinkler head without having to go on YouTube
does that make sense yep okay cuz I could go on
YouTube and watch how to fix a sprinkler head but
that's not me actually going and getting my hands
dirty what do you think i love it i love it i'm
trying to to boil it down to the first principles
why is this guy Why is this guy successful right
could you take that model and copy and paste it to
anything like landscaping or is welding something
special something unique and first of all I think
that there have probably been studies done i'm
completely guessing that millennials more than
any other generation just don't know how to do
stuff with their hands we didn't have to learn
right we've had phones for the last 15 years okay
so there's something there but I also think if we

[28:02]
boil it down to first principles most millennial
men would like to learn my pull out trash drawer
was broken and it was such a small job no handyman
wanted to come out there so I figured out how to
do it and it took me like 3 hours and it was so
simple and I know it probably would have taken a
handyman 15 minutes but you know what every single
time I open that drawer to throw something away
I feel so good about myself i feel amazing it
was worth every second of my the time that it
took me to do it right yeah so I I guarantee
you there's a business to be had here but my
counterpoint is I think welding is something
unique i think first principles men want to
create things with their hands right a a cube a
metal bowl like I think there's something innate
in us of taking raw materials organizing it into
something tangible and something useful that we
can show our wives and hopefully they're proud of
us about it right and so if I mean hopefully like

[29:00]
I know my wife's proud of me but like others right
i know my wife's proud of me so so with this as a
business concept I would think you would need to
find something that's similar to welding and maybe
it's not like drywall because that's kind of like
fixing something around the house but maybe it
is something like woodworking or cabinetry where
they're actually creating something does that make
sense i think totally makes sense so you really
think it has to be married with creation i think
so yeah because I'm looking at it from the from
like my perspective if there was something local
where I could go and meet up with somebody and
I could learn about plumbing here here's some of
the list I have plumbing electrical landscaping
yard maintenance DIY projects i would go for me
that's the biggest hangup is like I'll go watch
something on YouTube but I still want somebody
there is like wait is this how I hold it is this
how I actually get the joint to fit like I don't I
don't understand how to how to do it and I'm like
insecure about it and I think a key part is being
in a class full of other people that are like
openly insecure about it too you know there's like

[30:03]
a judgment free zone well and that's what like
our generation is is unique in that sense like our
parents generation they would never show that but
we're all like "Yeah I don't know how to do that
man i'm an idiot can you please show me how to
do it?" Yeah but like this house I have hundreds
of stations there are hundreds of sprinkler heads
i'm going to be like I need to learn how to change
a sprinkler head otherwise I'm going to pay like
$10,000 a year for some handyman to just come over
to my house and show me how to fix it can I tell
you the domain I bought oh dude you're asking a
junkie if he wants some crack like are you kidding
me please i want some crack fantasy handyman camp
oh that's a good one yeah yeah i know you hated it
just by the way you said it gosh dang it cancel it
it's seven syllables seven syllables that's my
only That's my only beat seven syllables seven
syllables but I do think there'd be a local
component to where you could kind of organize
these let's say you're a flipper in an area let's
say you're just a general contractor and you want

[31:01]
to increase your business it's it's the broy
example where like yeah you'll show them exactly
what to do but they're going to call you for
the implementation like you'll give away all the
secrets this is how you whatever change the oil on
a car or change the brake pads carburetor whatever
but they're still going to call you the handyman
because they're like "Wait a second he showed me
how to do that one time but I don't know if I want
to do it." So I could see this as a really cool
lead magnet situation for a young contractor of
some sort mechanic plumber electrician whatever
where on the weekends or during the week they just
hold these classes and show guys like us how to
freaking change stuff i love it all right i have
a business idea that I shamelessly ripped from you
that I think someone listening should start like
this afternoon okay I'm ready for it you ready but
hurt all right but I'm ready for it so you told
me about a month ago that you were using Chat GPT
to play trivia games with your sons correct okay
so about a week after you told me that I was on
a date with my 9-year-old boy and we were driving
around and you know sometimes it's hard thinking

[32:05]
of things to talk to your sons about or your kids
right yeah how was your day good what do you like
to do i don't know and so chat GPT can really be a
relationship enhancer and so I took a page out of
your playbook i used the chat GPT voice to speech
feature which is amazing like if I'm on my phone
using chat GPT i rarely type anymore i just talk
to it it's amazing and I'm kind of like my uncle
who only does like speech to text i'm like that
version now with chat GPT where everyone in the
room can hear me yeah hey uh chat GPT i have a
fungal infection on my scrotum i was just gonna
say fungal infection i was just gonna say that
i'm like in the middle of church fungal infection
third toe causes can we quickly talk about how
much I hate the new voice i hate it i don't want
you to pause i don't want to hear you breathing
i don't want to hear you chuckling be a robot be

[33:02]
fast like mine i don't know if yours sounds like
this this is exactly what mine sounds like okay
yeah so what happens in these i'm like I don't
need Stop i want you to sound authoritative 1.5x
why is that not an option it will speak faster
it will it will yeah just say speak faster and it
objectively does but you have to say it every time
you start a new chat anyways you're on a nice date
with your son and you start using that mode and so
I took your playbook and I said "Hey I'm a dad my
nine-year-old is here make a trivia game between
us where we can compete against each other but
make each of our questions like age appropriate
and it was amazing it kept track of the score
it asked him questions about Pokemon it asked me
questions about world history or whatever we had
a great time and I wonder if this is like you know
you know web 1.0 was like late 90s early 2000s 2.0
is like mobile right and web 2.0 you know brought
us all into our screens which is a shame i'm very

[34:01]
hopeful that web 3.0 know slash the new AI that we
have in front of us is going to hopefully bring us
more together it can like augment supplement our
relationships because if it weren't for this we
would have just been like sitting there in silence
listening to brand new which could be worse we
just had this and we were joking and we'd talk
about the questions and oh and it just it just
brought us together so here's the idea yes please
well I was just going to say this is a quick up
level i've started doing that now with two of my
boys and me so there's three of us and each one of
us have different topics so like Otto my youngest
he didn't he's like "I don't like geography i
want to do Minecraft." His trivia category was
Minecraft mine was geography roy's was history oh
cool and then we played it and like Otto ended up
winning i don't know how he knows so much freaking
about Minecraft but it was so fun man cuz then cuz
each it was a game for like each one of us that
we were playing together it wasn't like let's
play Risk and two of the three people actually

[35:01]
hate Risk but the one person you know what I mean
it's like it was really fun it was really cool now
that you mentioned that like are there even games
that exist like there are games where it's like
the minimum age is three like Uno we're all on the
same level and the older people are like I'm bored
there's no strategy here the younger people are
like this is fun has there ever been a game like
other than some random obscure board game that
works like that you know it's like literally on
everyone's level you're going to laugh at me i
think a game like Dungeons and Dragons is like
that in the sense that it's so I've never played
it but it's like you can tailor it to each person
and so it's like oh I'm a third level mage and I
have my little bag of tricks or whatever and you
know another person's an archer I don't know but
like it is unique to each one of them but no I
don't think that there is a game like that because
it was just it's too hard like there's there had
been no way to actually do it up to this point
right anyway the idea is someone needs to build
build a version of this in a mobile app a wrapper
er you could use lovable replet windsurf cursor

[36:01]
bolt new versel like you pick all of them can
build mobile app so easy like three bucks a month
maybe $20 lifetime you could charge for this and
like you would have user engagement it would bring
the the kids would go to it the dad would go the
like and you don't have to make this like a family
trivia game like you could literally make this
father-son trivia like motheraughter trivia as
niche as you want and then test all the marketing
angles like once you build one it's significantly
easier to build four or five other types of trivia
games insert any niche you want and then see which
one just resonates and takes off i thought about
building it and really the way you would do it is
you'd have a screen up front that was like "Okay
what topics are is this person interested in and
what age are they?" And then once you have that
you can play the game because on the back end
you you would prompt it to say make sure that
each question is tailored to their age and it's
age like age appropriate level of difficulty is
going to be balanced or or made for each age so

[37:01]
like the back end is super easy you want to know
the reason I haven't done it this is going to be
really stupid i'm worried that it would do really
well and I'd like wake up and I'd have and I'd
have like $1,000 in API charges you know what I
mean just cuz like so many people all of a sudden
they're doing the best problem you could have what
are you talking about i know i now crash that's
like the most backhanded compliment ever you know
why I'm not doing this 99% of the population cuz
I'm lazy i just haven't done it it's like
no I'm just I'm genuinely worried it would
be too successful and I wouldn't know what to do
with all that newfound wealth no because then I
have to figure out how do I integrate the payment
and I'm like crap because that's the problem you
want to have Nick that's why we're different ass
because I start looking into it and it's like oh
hey GitHub will you please do an audit of my code
or superbase do an audit of my code and it's like
uh fatal error here security protocol is missing
here flaw here and I'm like oh crap if I'm going

[38:02]
to do like a if I'm going to have a payment model
I can't have all this crap and then I got to get
somebody else to finish developing it those
are like the cascading steps that stop me from
actually doing it okay is that what you wanted to
hear no one cares work harder you said that Jo I
do love that idea man i do i I do freaking love
that idea someone's going to build this someone
listening to this will build this and I hope it's
for them it should be me and I have it yep all
right all right what you got well a quick follow
on owen and I are developing this thing called One
Life Tale and part of the experience is an AIG
guided or or like AI facilitated conversation
where family members can call at the same time
because they're in different locations but it
will spur them to tell stories about things like
you know when you get together with your family
at the holidays you tell the same five stories
over and over yeah yeah you know remember that
one time Chris where you just freaking showed up
on the way home from school and you had one bag
of candy and one bag of fruit and you were just
happy as could be well who captured this every

[39:05]
time I'm with my my parents they tell me the story
about me waking up in the middle of the night as
a four-year-old to sneak pizza out of the fridge
and I accidentally snuck the jalapeno pizza and
I woke up crying and screaming with a jug of milk
in my hand in my underwear okay it's embarrassing
don't tell that in front of my friends you were
diagnosed with habanero butt as I like to call
it hobierro habut anyways like who captures those
stories and unless you're with the family that's
all together so anyways a part of this app is
capturing those stories and AI is facilitating the
conversations so to your point I think in a weird
way there will be AI facilitated human interaction
like it's it's it's going to happen i really like
that idea actually and um we have like next to
our dining room table it's called it's like a
little card game and it's called table cards or
something and it's specifically for generating
conversations at the dinner table with your

[40:01]
kids so you just pull out a card and it's like a
thoughtprovoking question it's not customized to
your family they've sold millions of those things
so to me it's like a personalized version of that
in a digital form what I think you should have it
do is connect to either your iCloud photo album or
your Google photo album whichever you use and use
that to pull up questions like "Tell me about the
vacation you took to Orange Beach in 2017." Super
smart yeah that would be that would be amazing
because it's just going and mining things that
are already there so this app is actually Do you
remember when we talked like last November and I
said one of my favorite ideas would be to capture
stories of people in assisted living facilities
yeah wasn't that episode 101 i think it was back
on like December 6th how to cash in on the $16
billion genealogy boom with AI tools that was it
so like the the general premise behind the idea
was we have these generations that are passing
away my dad's here this week which we're getting
a bunch of stories what happens to those stories
they die with that generation or it's like oh you
you remember that story your dad used to tell you
so my dad is telling my my sons all these stories
and guess what they're wearing this week Chris

[41:05]
they're wearing my Limitless pendant m they're
capturing all the stories and and like I don't
have to be there for it and so we're capturing it
and be able to catalog that anyway anyway so we we
had that idea last year and and the premise is to
let families capture these stories even when their
family members in an assisted living facility
and then to like go to these facilities set up
a room capture the information and then create
a product for them where that that story exists
so Owen liked that idea and he already had a
product that was similar but it wasn't geared
towards the elderly population and he's now
like retoled it and we're focusing it on this
on capturing stories he's got 11 labs on the back
end that is taking their voices and so now you'll
have you know grandma's voice mom's voice dad's
voice it's also facilitating conversations with
people where you can capture the conversation
that they're having about the stories like we
were just talking about oh remember that time
where you were 16 you were such an idiot you

[42:01]
crashed that car so now there's like a repository
of these stories and what it will do then is take
the stories and the input from each person and it
will create like a consolidated story effectively
with a narrator who's telling it i just love
that piece of it because now we can actually
capture the cool things that have happened and the
stories that have passed from older generations
and like my kids can hear it cuz my dad tells a
story about when he was captured by the Indians
and almost cooked alive or the time that he beat
some guy up who was a bounty hunter that because
he was swearing at him too much like it's these
are just funny stories that you you probably will
forget over time oh okay i love all of it i love
everything you're saying to me right now but I
think I just leveled up our original idea this is
so obvious in retrospect so we had talked about
putting like some sort of a booth or a laptop
or something lightweight in an assisted living
facility where someone could walk up to it they
could be prompted once again because they might
not remember all the most relevant stories so the
voice agent would just start talking to them and
get all these stories out of them and record
them why not just make this an app that's just

[43:04]
an AI voice agent or a phone number that you call
anyone in the assisted living facility that has
a phone or the person themselves with their own
phone could just start talking to an AI agent and
they probably wouldn't even know it's an AI agent
and it would ask them like tell us about this tell
us about your time in the war tell us about and
it would it's the same idea except done through
an app or or through a literal phone number yeah
I think the only hard part with that would be to
get them to adopt it and to utilize it although
I think once you got them to use it once they're
going to use it over and over and over again
because all of us have that like innate desire to
connect with other humans and dude it feels like
you're talking to another human right like you're
having a conversation you're telling stories back
and forth and when you get to that age generally
you're more interested in like telling your story
than you are necessarily of like hearing everybody
else's stuff so all you have to do is prompt
them they start talking and then you capture it
i think it's a great idea it's a banger all right
so this brings me to my favorite idea of the week

[44:05]
last week you talked about piggybacking it's one
of our frameworks another one of our frameworks is
riding tailwinds title waves all right and there
are a couple of big title waves one big title wave
is the aging population like we just talked about
another really really big title wave is the lack
of skilled labor and I want to go through some
statistics to sort of set this up so right now we
are short 550,000 plumbers 600,000 auto mechanics
80,000 electricians right now okay in just in the
US just in the United States by 2033 almost 2
million unfilled manufacturing jobs which is
crazy our generation grew up and it was basically
like if you don't go to college you don't want to
end up like that guy and they point to the plumber
or the electrician and it kind of screwed a whole
generation of craftsmen out of the job force right
and so now these guys are micro started that now

[45:05]
these guys are retiring and there's not enough
people to replace them but what we're seeing
also is this other massive title wave an aging
infrastructure within the United States homes
are aging like crazy so stuff's falling apart are
people selling it and just moving to new builds
there are some people moving into new builds
which also need tradesmen but people also need
to fix up their house maybe they remodeled their
kitchen or maybe the electrical's going bad like
we just replaced our our uh panel here at our
house because it was a big problem so we know
that there's these sort of big title waves
happening the number of of craftsmen is going
way down there's a big demand for it because we
have an aging population and we have an aging
infrastructure in the United States but then
you also have guys like me and you and we did
talk about this idea last week but we have guys
like me and you who don't really know what to do
with their hands i'm going to tell you right now
Chris I can't build it but I think someone needs
to build it i bought the domain handymans.com
why isn't there somewhere for people like you

[46:05]
and I to go and just find a handyman mentor not
even like oh I need to find a guy to to go and
fix my HVAC or whatever right because if you go
right now and you try to find a business that's
going to fix your HVAC or your plumbing or your
electrical how booked out are they they're like
weeks or months booked out they're not going to
come to your house i don't necessarily need a
union bonded licensed plumber to come to my house
i just need a guy who knows how to his way around
the kitchen to come show me how to change a couple
of pipes right like if your if your dad lived in
town right if you Exactly or your uncle or whoever
you're close with like literally a mentor that can
show you how to do this stuff because it's
not complicated and I'm not I'm not going to
sue somebody but I'm also I don't want to wait
for you know my air conditioning to get fixed
in the summertime maybe and maybe HVAC is too
complicated but I think there are a lot of things
that you could fix around your house and if we're
just waiting on a company to fix it we're going
to be waiting a long time so why not take back
some of that lead time and some of that demand

[47:04]
and start hooking up guys like you and I with
local mentors who know how to do this stuff so
that we can learn how to do it so we can learn how
to actually just the easy stuff instead of waiting
on a freaking electrician to come out because my
breaker tripped and I don't know how to flip the
switch back you know what I mean so you're saying
like not to connect millennials with handymen but
with like other older dudes like boomers that
just kind of know their way around a house yeah
i went to Home Depot today who helped me at Home
Depot today this older boomer super nice guy super
knowledgeable probably just is working at Home
Depot after he retired actually not probably
i asked him he's working at Home Depot after he
retired because he knows his way around the yard
basically and he was like that's every Home Depot
employee that is every Home Depot employee that's
what And honestly if I need help at Home Depot
I'm not walking up to the millennial well dude
we got white hair on a brother we got there i'm
with my dad and he's like "Oh don't worry we'll

[48:01]
just ask one of the guys there they'll know." And
I'm like "Dad I don't think you can just do that."
And we walk up there and my dad finds this finds
one guy and I'm like "Oh yeah go ask him." He's
like "No no no he he won't know." And he was
like "A guy like our age he does not have new
balances." Hold on oh his hands look so soft what
is he doing moisturizing every day come on [ __ ]
mimi anyway so so he went and found this guy he
just walked and they just started talking about
it and so he comes over but it's that right like
I don't necessarily need the local guy who owns
an HVAC company i just need the retired guy who
probably is feeling useless and maybe doesn't see
his kids as much as he would like to i need that
guy to like connect with me so he can just show
me how to do stuff around my house and I would
start I honestly would start at Home Depot and
like 100% what do you think dude that that's
what I was going to say like get your first
customers start this locally pick your city go to
Home Depot and Lowe's every different shift and
round up as many guys as you can and just start
with the database it's a marketplace so build the

[49:02]
supply side first right you get their name phone
email right and this is very much a do things
that don't scale thing in the beginning you're
just making connections then you start finding
helpless millennials like us to text you anytime
they need help and then you just play matchmaker
literally low tech you just put them in a group
text together and let them go out and there's not
even money exchanged maybe there is maybe you
Venmo the guy 20 bucks for helping or whatever
but you just kind of you spend three months doing
this just to get a feel for how the interactions
are working maybe you find that the mentor ends
up going to the guy's house 80% of the time you
didn't expect that to ever happen you thought
they would just hop on FaceTime but because of
he's an older generation he would rather just get
his hands on it maybe that changes the pricing
structure like this is the type of business that
you don't want to approach it from like "Oh I know
how this is going to go i'm going to build it
like this." No this is innovative this is new
like people aren't doing this so you really want
to start very very flexible and be willing and
ready to change your mind or pivot the the offer
the pricing the whatever as quickly as you can do

[50:05]
you remember when you went and worked for Amazon
for like a month if people don't know this it was
amazing yeah chris had multiple businesses and
for whatever reason you were just like I want to
go work at Amazon cuz I want to see how it works
i'll tell you why it's cuz we were running a third
party logistics business and I wanted to know
how the best in the game did it from the inside
and they'll hire anyone with a pulse and luckily I
have a pulse so they hired me game recognized game
i don't know jeff Bezos saw something in me
and he said "I want you personally i want you
to run our Plano Texas after hours between the
hours of 3:00 a.m and 6 a.m shift my team." It
is crazy like the warehouse I worked at was one
of 23 DFW area warehouses they only stocked shoes
and I worked the like 700 p.m to 7 a.m shift
on a forklift and it was on a this invisible

[51:00]
track i couldn't like go crazy with it and knock
over all the pallet racks you literally you just
press go i could I'll one day I'll make a whole
episode about it because it was very interesting
but it was awesome well dude and you so you would
call me at the end of every shift that was when we
talked multiple times a day which we don't anymore
because we're both have a family and are busy we
don't talk anymore anyways do you remember like
every day you'd come out and we'd have like a
different idea you're like "Dude we could start a
business where we just bring a food truck to the
Amazon offices or we could start a business where
we just bring X Y and Z and what you wanted to do
was place flyers on every car in the parking lot."
I don't remember i still love that idea okay no I
love that idea yeah that's what I would do that's
what I would do for this at the Home Depot i would
go find Home Depot and just be like "All right
the guys shopping here and the guys working here
are my target mentors." We'd have to then fill
the other side which are the you know helpless
millennials like like you and I i think that
would be maybe I'm like oversimplifying it i feel

[52:02]
like Facebook ads for that honestly you could use
targeted Facebook ads to that geography and and to
me what I would do is a simple like hey just pay
through the app and pay us a percentage like these
guys aren't the mentors aren't doing it because
they want to make a ton of money so I'm sure you
know it's not going to like turn into a business
for them but they they probably would appreciate
being paid something unless and like us helpless
millennials are going to feel better about paying
them than just feeling like we're taking advantage
of this person so there's going to be an exchange
of value in some way or form and that's why Yeah
this is I know I've never said this before but
like this one this one's good i don't like
any business idea i know i really do like
this for real i know and it's kind of there's this
dichotomy happening where on one hand this is very
much the type of business where you sweaty you go
out there you put flyers on cars you're shaking
hands at Home Depot you're doing things that don't
scale but once you see that it works in Greenville
Texas like it will work anywhere like at that
moment it's like okay we're going venture scale

[53:04]
here because we need to blow this up as quickly
as possible whereas most businesses I would really
not suggest you raise a bunch of venture capital
for but I think this could be one where you do i
know we've talked about this before but it's
it's almost like the remember when we talked
about cable and the unbundling that happened
where it's like there's all these platforms now
they've unbundled it first it was really bundled
and then it was unbundled to me this this feels
like the unbundling of the social platforms right
it's like this is a very specific niche but it is
social so you need some type of a platform in
order for them to communicate and connect and
this feels like a really cool opportunity to do
that yeah couple other ways you could take this
you know our friend Hector yeah i'm having him
on the pod this week he helps people start trade
school businesses and it's really interesting
but his bread and butter is selling like a a
certification course for HVAC technicians and once
they pay like eight or 12,000 that's fully funded
by the government he sends them an Oculus like
$400 and they just log into it uh through some

[54:06]
software that he actually he didn't even build
this like I think he's just white labeling it
and they just put on their Oculus and he showed me
a video of it and they're like fixing HVAC units
like in the in the metaverse basically you could
use something like you could go that direction
you could build an Oculus app for this okay more
technical more friction to launch to launching i
like your idea better but that's another angle the
other angle is to do what what I do when something
breaks this just happened with my HVAC two weeks
ago it stopped working one of our units and I went
out there and have you ever used like the chat GBT
FaceTime feature oh man i start FaceTiming a Chad
GBT it's insane and it's like uh it's like all
right here's what I'm looking at my house isn't
cooling the fan's turning house isn't cooling
and it's like well show me this coil down here
show me the coil it's like okay put your hand on
it Chris is it cold it's not cold i think you're
out of Freon or else your condenser is broken
freon's going to be really cheap the condenser

[55:03]
is going to be like three grand let me see your
coils show me coils okay what unit is this can
you show me the label it should be right on that
left corner show them the label okay you're nine
years in you might still be under warranty like
are you kidding me how valuable is this $20 a
month subscription like that's kind of what we're
talking about it was being my mentor yeah it was
being your mentor put that in a rapper take that
because I promise you 93% of Americans don't know
that that feature exists they might be using Chad
GBT every day they don't know they can do that no
put it in a rapper call it handyman mentor you
know AI handyman mentor or whatever and just
that 10 bucks a month 20 bucks a month 100 bucks
a year and it just does that exact same thing dude
I literally did the thing today when I looked at
my sprinkler cuz my sprinkler is broken and I was
like "Hey I'm trying to figure out what's wrong
with this like what do you think could be wrong
with it?" I was like "Well it could be a couple
things it gives me three reasons." And one of
the reasons was it might be a low point in the
grass and if it's a low point in the grass then

[56:00]
the water pressure is going to build up and so
you might need to put in a check valve and I was
like "Oh that's interesting." And I tested like
three things and that's what it is it was the
freaking check valve and I go to Home Depot and
I'm talking to the guy and I was like "Hey do you
think it might be something to do with the water
pressure because it's all it's all accumulating in
the middle of the yard at the low point." And in
Home Depot he was like "Yes that's a really good
idea i I hadn't thought of that." And you got
that idea from Chad i got that idea from Chad
GBT right like he wouldn't necessarily have known
right away to be like "Oh is this at a low spot?"
But if you walked out into my yard you would have
seen right away like "Oh it's a low spot that
makes sense the water pressure is high you need
a check valve because otherwise the sprinkler is
not going to be able to handle the pressure that's
currently pressing." Like it blew my mind it blew
my mind that it could actually do that oh my gosh
and now I'm a handyman you're a handyman now I'm
going to give you one more adjacent idea to this
before we get into your last one okay and this
is a quick one i also think that there's a way to
do this for guys like me who are not handy where
you could have a YouTube-based course and mail
them a big package and in the package would be

[57:03]
some drywall some electrical wiring maybe a cover
and you go through the process of like building a
a small little drywall right like I don't know
3x3 and then it walks you through like how do I
cut out for the electrical outlet oh okay how
do I wire it and so then by the end of it you
are getting the hands-on experience but you're
also not having to wreck your house i think that
would be a really cool idea to have a kit like
that i saw that idea in our notes and I didn't
really like it but as you describe it I really do
the reason I didn't like it cuz it's like shipping
drywall it's so But like you're talking about
fixing a patch and if you were to say "Here's the
course here's your shopping list go to Home Depot
and buy this stuff." No they're not going to Home
Depot they needs to be frictionless they need to
click three times and then two days later have a
package show up and they've already paid and you
know what most of them they're never even going
to open the package they're not going to do the
thing cuz that's human nature it doesn't matter
they paid right yeah i like that idea a lot like
how to split a wire what I would do I would find

[58:05]
a I tried to convince Mike Kiggins to do this i'd
find a DIYer on like Instagram Tik Tok YouTube or
whatever and just be like "Dude this would be
an amazing offering you should do this." And I
would just piggyback off of them i love it all
right what do you got i got one so I see this
Instagram video of this newlywed and she said
I forget how it went but she basically says "I
went and found every major company Target Bed Bath
and Beyond yada yada yada and I found all of their
addresses and I sent baby shower invites it was
either baby shower or or wedding shower invites to
all of them." And it was like 150 and 25 of them
sent me gifts or gift cards or money or something
and I started digging into it and that's the thing
like people are doing that especially women more
and more when they have a baby or when they get
married they'll just mass send these invitations
like paper invitations okay physical to companies
just at like the corporate address saying like I'm

[59:02]
a huge fan of Target I'm a huge fan of Bed Bath
and Beyond yada yada yada like I'd love to invite
you to my wedding and it's really they're just
asking for free stuff but it works because the
people in charge of marketing for these companies
know that when people get gifts they post about
it on social media And so it's free marketing
for them it's a win-win and so this woman got
hundreds or even thousands of dollars worth
of free gifts simply by sending $40 worth of
invitations and she did it by hand like she wrote
them all out by hand so I'm over here thinking
like why is this not a service why can people not
just pay 50 bucks to have invitations sent out to
all of these companies so you build a database
and you could have a thousand companies in there
large and small mom and pop owned businesses
Fortune 500 companies doesn't matter and the
people go to the website how many invitations you
want to send out 50 500 a thousand and you just
use an API for a direct mail company many of them
have APIs you're not in the direct mail business

[1:00:00]
you just have a website you could build it with
lovable or replet or whatever and you pay money
and that money covers the cost of the envelopes
do the invitations match the invitations she's
sending her friends and family probably not it
doesn't matter who cares no one knows and you
just take a margin so let's say it costs 45 cents
to send each one you want to send it to 100 that's
$45 you charge $199 for this service and then you
can say in our experience our customers usually
get about $500 or $1,000 worth of free gifts what
are we talking about dude all right i'm going to
uplevel it for you push it with Facebook ads i'm
working with this guy he wants to buy a business
and I'm like helping him try to find a business
and one of the things I told him was you need
to send out mailers of you right your family hey
this is me here's a letter about me and he's like
should I do like handwritten and I told him dude
this was what 15 years ago when is either you or
your wife got your realtor's license and so you my
wife it you didn't actually write it but you had
like the computer handwrited out or it was like
printed in handwriting it just sent postcards we

[1:01:02]
just uploaded a CSV uploaded to Postcard Design
and we were done yeah okay so I told him about
that and he's like "Oh interesting." And so
he goes and does some research and he finds
this company i think this is the one it's called
ghostandwriter.com these are robots the robots
literally write on a piece of paper his messages
and so he wrote like a thousand of them i can't
remember exactly how much it costs not only the
open rate but the response rate is just so much
higher when it looks like it was actually written
as opposed to just printed by a computer as it
comes out so you could even do it where you have
a robot handwriting it and this is exactly what
it is yep ghost handwriting.com the other thing
similar but related i talked to a guy this week
his company is called Hire Bus and he's just built
a bunch of apps and one of the apps that he built
specifically for home services and he built
this on replet right this isn't like a overly
complicated app he pulled all of the addresses
and then he had that I don't know how he wrote

[1:02:01]
it but he had that then go to Google Street View
of those houses took a picture of that house and
then that house was put onto custom postcards so
when the homeowner goes out there they're getting
a postcard with their house on it and they're
looking at that postcard and they're like "Oh
this is interesting." And then there's a QR code
on the bottom and the QR code pops up to a video
of him that is saying like "Hey I'm looking for
whatever whatever he was pitching engagement rate
was 15%." He got 3% of them to schedule calls
and then 1% of of the hundred that he sent the
1% closed so for every $100 that he spent it was
about $1 postcard so for every $100 that he spent
he got it was a $4,000 ticket item like that was
already mind-blowing but I'm like what if you took
it another step further and you were a window
washing company or a roofing company or some a
gutter company you get their Google maps picture
of their house and then you have AI change their
windows or you have AI change the paint color have
AI change Yep change the roof hey this is what

[1:03:04]
your house would look like with us give us a call
if it's a hundred bucks and you know your close
rate is a 1% close rate and your average ticket
size is $4,000 like what are we talking about here
what are we talking about dude all day dude it's
just it's another way of removing friction you
knock on a homeowner's door and you say "Hey
we paint your house white." It's like "Okay
uh what's your close rate on that?" Whereas if you
said "Hey we paint your house white." And you hold
up a picture of their house painted white oh my
gosh I liked my house but that looks much better
it removes the friction of not knowing what
the end result looks like i was just I was
just talking about the postcard what about an app
for the guys who go doortodoor it's on their iPad
and they're like "Hey lip with the iPad." That's
freaking genius that would be incredible oh you
don't like that color what about this color
like right then and there you could show them
what their house looked like or even if it was
direct mail like you said like in Texas I swear
every house is is red brick right let's say you
take a neighborhood of a thousand homes that are

[1:04:02]
red brick you send them all pictures of their
house painted white and most people that get
that are not going to like what it looks like
or else they would have already painted their
house white but guess what that gets them talking
they're going to post a picture on Instagram haha
how ugly does this look this this idiot thought my
house would look good white thank you for the free
marketing you know isn't he a idiot i think that
would be an incredible business to start and and
fairly easy to build these businesses didn't exist
three months ago because the the image generation
capabilities weren't quite there yet but it
is now all right I'm going to share my screen
dude check this out we moved into a new house i
posted these pictures and I was like "Hey this
is what the front of our house looks like." Okay
and I I posted multiple pictures you can see them
over here here are the pictures of the same area
of my house taken from different angles i feel
like the area is out of control can you make me an
image of what it should look like and create me a
plan for getting there right so like look at this
it's just a mess these are some of the pictures I
uploaded this is what it spits out you ready look
at that you've been to my house looks amazing like

[1:05:02]
it looks incredible looks awesome and it does look
It does look like my house and it Yeah it does it
literally created hey here's the image and a plan
for me this is exactly what we're talking about
like help the homeowner see literally see not
just in their mind's eye but see what it might
look like how many more sales are you going to
close oh my gosh forever and ever amen and amen
thanks for listening today
really appreciate you guys
i would love it if you shared with a
friend and left me a fivestar review
