right picture this for a moment you own
a short-term rental property that makes
you $800,000 a year you get 100% of your
bookings from Airbnb one day you wake up
an Airbnb emails you and says you're
banned we don't need to tell you why
what do you do your Revenue goes to zero
my friend Isaac what he did was he spent
$900 on an influencer to do a free two
night stay giveaway that $900 investment
turned into $40,000 of bookings a year
later he kept leaning into this strategy
and he had $150 000 Instagram followers
and he got 80% of his bookings directly
through his website not from Airbnb
anymore even though they reinstated him
if you want to hear the full story of
this go to the ker office on YouTube and
