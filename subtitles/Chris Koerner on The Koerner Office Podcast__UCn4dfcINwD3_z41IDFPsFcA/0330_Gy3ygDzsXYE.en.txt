[00:00]
is that going to happen absolutely is it
going to be me that does it no someone
much less ethical than me will launch
this business I would never do it and
you reach out to them with this offer
hey why are you using zapier you're
spending way too much money I will
convert you to and charge 30% of the
savings and then the real money is in
being like family pictures are awful I
would pay money if they were like hey
look I'm going to take enough pictures
of your family and I'm now using AI I'll
be able to get everybody smiling but
this would have been great for my family
cuz my parents got divorced when I was
13 and we never went on vacations after
the divorce so we could have generated
pictures of us on the beach and on
vacation we could have been an AI
generated happy family AI is going to
make a lot of families happy not yours
but families in the
[Music]
future I was on Twitter last week and I
saw a viral tweet 2.2 million views by
Felix so this is what the Tweet says
remote jobs for introverts no talking
required you can do them in the evening
from home after your 95 job and they pay

[01:01]
from home after your 95 job and they pay
well in USD open this arrow pointing
down 2.2 million views and all he does
is go on to like list like a Tesla job
or an apple job that like would be good
for an introvert so we've never really
talked about Job the jobboard business
before but other podcasts have it's an
amazing business because it's very very
passive right you just okay let me let
me stop let me stop let me start why
it's a bad business it's a bad business
because it's a Marketplace you need
buyers and you need sellers you need
people to list jobs and you need people
to find jobs marketplaces are hard but
if you can figure out the marketplace if
you can go Niche and do something a
little different then a job board is an
amazing business because it is so
passive you don't have customer support
companies go find it they list a job for
$2 to $500 and then people go find the
jobs and apply to jobs so what about a
job Ford for introverts or extroverts go
oh interesting so it's it's not a job
board based on job type it's it's a job

[02:00]
board based on job type it's it's a job
board based on like personality type
exactly I think that's really creative
there is a big Trend right now happening
and you see it with like decoupling
right we used to have big cable
companies Comcast and then what did we
do now all of a sudden we've got Netflix
and Hulu and ESPN plus and CB whatever
like now we're like buying all of those
things individually you see it large
social media platforms like Facebook and
Instagram and Twitter
well now like local communities are
becoming more and more popular and the
same thing is happening with hiring
right and job boards like there's a I
think there's a physician job board
that's pretty small but it's doing like
$80 million a year because it's just
targeted at Physicians or there's
nursing job boards or and it's not
necessarily as high-tech as some of
these other job boards but it's very
Niche so hey I know exactly what I'm
going for and I know that it's going to
serve me and my community but those are
all job type spe specific which I still

[03:00]
all job type spe specific which I still
love them like you and I have talked
about doing a job board but I've never
thought about doing it based on like
personality type yeah how would you why
not well you're going to go find all the
subreddits and all the the Facebook
groups for introverts I mean it is a
religion like in my household we talk
about introverts and extroverts on a
weekly basis really split down the yeah
it's just like a thing I don't know how
it started but all my kids refer to it
there's three introverts and three
extroverts in my family and as our
friend Steph would say labels disable he
would not like that but forget it labels
are awesome yeah labels are for
disabled I like this also because you
don't need to have any coding experience
JB board. and nice board. those are both
awesome like out of the box plug andplay
job board pieces of software so I think
if you can find the community have them
rally around your cause then you can go
aggregate a bunch of jobs that are
already listed on other websites that

[04:01]
already listed on other websites that
might be befitting of an introvert and
list them yourself so you're not an
empty Marketplace that way you can have
the the supply side full before you get
the demand side and then once you get
some traction from the job applicants
then you can actually go out and start
soliciting people to put paid listings
up talk to me about the technology for
it because that kind of just it's always
scared me oh it's a job board someone's
got to go online they got to apply I
wouldn't know how to build the platform
necessary to handle the inbound the
screen scening the communications Etc
think of like upwork right you post to
upwork you don't want them going around
or upwork at least or fer they don't
want them going around and billing you
they want the transaction to go through
their platform because that's that's how
they get paid they they charge a
percentage of the transaction so in my
mind there it just be technologically
complicated is it not like would it not
be hard to build a platform for a job
board like this that is literally what I
just said I I heard there's two plug
hate when you do that I just thought

[05:01]
hate when you do that I just thought
it's easy what I'm what I'm saying is
those two things solve that that like
you would You' be able to have a job
board platform that allows for private
Communications Payment Processing po
okay all that stuff it does all that how
would you charge for it do is it would
it be the same as like every other model
it's just a percentage of placement or
is it like a current flat it's a flat
fee per post to paid to the employer
paid by the employer you mean yeah okay
so people who are joining it aren't
paying it's not a right what would be
the way to work up to it I feel like
you'd have to work up
to the marketplace because you have to
have like you said it's it's
double-sided you have to have the supply
and the demand it's just really hard to
bring them both together at the same
time seems like you want to start like
locally right you go to other job boards
and you you take their listings that
seem to be like a listing for an
introvert and you just put it on your
website so just your gut like H I think
this looks like an introvert you

[06:00]
this looks like an introvert you
wouldn't necessarily beforehand kind of
write a script and say these are the job
functions and titles that I want and
then just go run it most of these
jobboard platforms have like API
Integrations with the Eds of the world
so you can you can with one click you
can fill the job board with jobs and
like they're not paying you but who
cares you're just trying to make it look
like an active Marketplace oh so the
supply is done Supply is taken care of
you don't have to like convince anybody
to go do it it'd be the demand side and
that's where you're saying Reddit going
onto the Reddit subreddits yeah that's
to find the demand dude I like it what
else could you do what okay introverts
and extroverts you could do it with like
you know Myers Briggs type stuff you
know what would be an interesting one is
ex professional athletes I know that's
like hyper Niche but I love hiring ex
Collegiate and ex I haven't hired that
many professional athletes but like ex-
Collegiate athletes like they work hard
they know what it takes they usually are
disciplined they're
driven like if you could go to a an

[07:01]
driven like if you could go to a an
employer or like Market it as like hey
this is the profile and we only Market
these to professional athletes let's say
I think you get a lot of people signing
up and probably even charge a premium
because it is so much more targeted yeah
I mean you could do I mean you could get
a lot more Niche than that if you wanted
you could do like D2 athletes you could
do like D2 track and field athletes yeah
yeah yeah you could do return
missionaries like LDS return
missionaries yeah dude I like that idea
so I know I know you know the answer to
these questions all right I know you
know but I'm going to ask you anyway
because I'm trying to set it up for the
listener Chris okay don't T hey hey hey
hey my eyes they're up here okay buddy
hey I'm getting I'm eating gum okay can
I pull some gum
out you know what Spirit Halloween is
and anybody who's listening probably
knows what Spirit Halloween and if you
don't know what Spirit Halloween is
think of the Halloween store that pops
up every year around this time of year

[08:00]
up every year around this time of year
in the vacant closed down you know
Sports Chalet Sports Authority whatever
you whatever Sears whatever company that
went out of business they just haven't
filled the rent Spirit pops up and they
sell Halloween costumes and Halloween
accessories I want you to to first take
a guess for me for companies that are in
the space of Halloween costumes
decorations the Halloween industry
whatever you want to call it how much do
you think they generate every year in
Revenue costumes decorations accessories
toys all all that stuff how much do you
think they generate few hundred million
okay thank you you just soft balled me
dude 12 12 billion dollar a year 12
billion with a B now the next question
Spirit Halloween all right that little
company it's it's literally a pop-up
company they operate for a short period
of Time how much do you think that they
generate every single year in Revenue
half a bli billion okay 1.2 billion

[09:02]
half a bli billion okay 1.2 billion
they're about 10% of the total Market 1
it's a billion doll company that just
does pop up Halloween sales so my gear
is going dude got Papa Nick thinking
about this and I wanted to bring this up
to Chris The Observer all right christop
Christopher James Kerner I wanted to
talk about in my mind there are seasonal
opportunities for businesses that that
you don't think about until it's
happening that are interesting and so
I'm I'm going to name a couple Christmas
Tree farms and Christmas tree
lots I think those are fascinating mhm
we've talked about this before fireworks
4th of July and New Year's the problem
is because they are seasonal you aren't
necessarily thinking about it all year
it takes a long time to get them spun up
there is a potential investment so my
question to you distribution Guru
Christopher James Kerner how would you
think about spinning up a seasonal
business like how would you go about all

[10:02]
business like how would you go about all
right I want to do Christmas lights what
would be like your next step one word oh
you ready oh yeah
piggyback I'm G see myself out I'm done
we're done here I want my piggyback
piggyback piggyback piggyback what do
you mean piggyback you got to go find
the the service brands that are not too
small but not too big and borrow their
customers say hey you you own a
landscaping business I know you've got a
crew you got six trucks do you do
Christmas lights no we're thinking about
okay I do can you just like refer us for
you know we'll give you a cut or would
you just like white label us you can
charge you can collect the payment and
just pay us 70% of it and we'll come do
the actual work just tap in like you're
just like all right who already has
access to the target market that I want
access to and I'm going to go to them
that makes a whole sense landscaping

[11:01]
that makes a whole sense landscaping
companies how what about okay Christmas
Tree farms like how would I launch a
Christmas tree farm how would you how
how would you go about identifying who
would have access to your Target
demographic like I always see them in
like a a grocery store parking lot or
like a Home Depot or maybe that's a
market where it's like H they've kind of
already got their people right like my
Town tuscalo Alabama already has the
tree lots that everybody goes to and
maybe that's maybe that's a bad one but
here's uh let's do uh another example
seasonal I got an idea okay I'm here so
we're assuming that we're launching a
Christmas tree farm right yes is that
what you're saying okay so or Christmas
tree lot that sells the trees right yeah
yeah yeah and we're also assuming that
we're not going to be you know raising
these trees ourselves we're going to go
buy them from somewhere else yep okay so
with that in mind I don't think there's
any loyalty to the Christmas tree
business I think it's one of those
things where you know every November
rolls around families driving around
they see it in in the corner Park
parking lot out in front of the Home

[12:00]
parking lot out in front of the Home
Depot or whatever it is like oh it's
time to get a Christmas tree they don't
know what company's behind it they don't
care they just they want a real
Christmas tree so they always buy it
from the place that they see it and
maybe it's at this intersection one year
and that intersection another year they
don't know or care if it's the same
business or not so what I would do is I
would not worry about any competitors I
would go to the Department of
Transportation website and look at the
traffic counts at all the intersections
in my local area however far away I'm
willing to drive and I would the one
with the the most cars and then I would
R it down look look at Google Earth and
find the intersections that actually
have space for something like this
because many of them won't and then I
would go to the tax records and find the
owner of that land and try to try to
lease that land for two months every
year all right and then I would just
popup shop a genius idea I'm gonna try
to level it up a little bit so you are
talking about getting customers by the
busiest streets all right because
because that's that's traditionally how
they're done right hey I'm going to see

[13:01]
they're done right hey I'm going to see
it and then I'm going to pull over and
I'm gonna go and buy a tree how could
you find them before the impulse by like
could you Target on Facebook like hey
reserve your Christmas tree today 20%
off and like pre-sell these Christmas
trees and then go to a commercial I'm
I'm sure you could find a commercial
Tree Farm because like surely the the
tree farms are not the ones who are also
popping up in the Ralph's or Kroger's
parking lot right I'm sure you can find
a commercial Tree Farm like negotiate a
lower rate and and you're essentially
just wholesaling them and then obviously
you'd have to you would have to solve
for the delivery but is there a way you
could go upstream and digitally Market
to those people either through Facebook
or through Google or Instagram and get
them to buy even before they're on the
road with the impulse buy for trees I
think you could I think that makes
logical sense but I've never seen anyone
doing it so it would just make me
nervous oh so if no one's ever done it
before okay H I mean really like I just

[14:00]
before okay H I mean really like I just
don't want to be the first person to try
that right I would go to the the guy who
is doing it and just kind of like talk
them up a little bit oh it's a cool
business oh how many how many of these
trees you go through every season and
I'm sure they get asked that all the
time it's like okay 2,000 trees every
season in two months his this
intersection has 20,000 cars so I can
expect to do 10% of the amount of cars
in trees this intersection has 75,000
cars oh I wonder if I could do 7500
trees in two months huh
like I need to pull out all the stops to
get one of those four corners of that
intersection and then I would just try
to open hopefully a little earlier than
the other guy it's not really necessary
it's just a location game I think yeah I
love it well like Christmas trees are
just one but there are a ton of just
seasonal businesses snow cone stands ice
cream stands car washers in the summer
fund like fundraising thing I I saw one
that was an ice rink I posted about it
like someone just like made an ice rink
in their backyard thought thought was
super cool I think there are the

[15:01]
super cool I think there are the
seasonal businesses that by the time you
see them and you're like oh dude I want
to launch that business it's just too
late so I like the idea of like working
my way back and thinking all right next
year if I was going to do a Christmas
lights business what am I going to do
and I like I really like that idea of
just go and find the landscaper like go
and find who already has that Target
demographic and then reverse engineer
with them like piggyback gosh dang it
Chris you're good at this you're good at
this I don't know I'm I'm a framework
guy what do you want me to
say tattoo it on my forehead Nate all
right what you got all right I got a I
got a funny one it's kind of funny
little comedic break for you but this
this could be a thing you had me it
funny I know you don't watch the show
love is blind do you get the concept yes
okay blind people dating and they take
their sticks and they like feel the
other person's face they're like I think
they're goodlooking right that's how it
works that's bum fights no that's

[16:00]
works that's bum fights no that's
that got cancelled no for those who
don't know love is blind is like one of
the biggest shows on Netflix and there's
like seven seasons now they're releasing
three seasons a year which tells me it's
very very popular of course it's Netflix
they don't have to disclose how many
viewers they're getting but clearly it's
very popular the whole concept is you
have men in pods about 15 men and women
in pods and they don't have their phones
they don't bring in their phones with
them they just have each other and then
they date like through a wall so you can
hear each other's voice you can talk but
they're not allowed to talk about each
other's appearance and they're not
allowed to see each other until after
they have proposed until they're engaged
so it's like online dating but you but
you're them yep okay you you hear their
real voice but you are not allowed to
talk about your appearance and you're
not allowed to see each other and you
don't have your phone so you literally
it's it is it is a pure show yeah in the
sense in the sense that they can't see
each other and in every other sense it
is a very impure show okay okay yes sir
it's so it's very entertaining and the

[17:00]
it's so it's very entertaining and the
best part there's two best parts of the
season number one is when they first see
each other right the sliding doors open
and they're like and it's just like you
can just read on their faces do they
like what they see or not because
there's two emotions that are
potentially out play there's
excitement as the viewer you're like
excited for them to see and then
immediately there's there could be the
cringe of like oh she doesn't like him
oh he you know what I mean yeah well
it's just you watch their faces right
right when when they first see each
other and sometimes they're
like and you can like just for a split
second in their eyes you can be like oh
no no no it's like that Leo DiCaprio
meme where he like and he's pointing
like you think he's ugly you think she's
ugly and so it's just so good because
then they Embrace and they hug and they
kiss and they share rings and you can
just tell if one of them is not into it
sometimes neither one of them is into it
and I just love it but because all of

[18:00]
and I just love it but because all of
them in the pods they're like honestly I
don't even care about looks honestly
like like for real though I don't care
about looks like I don't even care you
could be 500 pounds I just don't care
they all say that to each other and it's
like dude stop yeah just stop anyway I
haven't even gotten into the idea yet
that's the concept so that's the best
part of the season and then the other
best part of the season is when they go
to the altar because a lot of times at
the altar even most of the time one of
them says never mind I'm out oh oh oh
they're getting married yeah holy okay
oh wow that's high stakes dude they get
engaged before they see each other and
then they go on vacation together like
all the couples to like a resort in
Mexico and they like date date and then
they go back home to like live in the
real world together and then they have a
wedding day H and they're not allowed to
like break up before the altar they have
to break up at the altar if they're
going to break up oh my gosh dude
they're like contractually obligated so
okay all right if you are watching this
clip right now you are watching this on
YouTube and if you are a fan of podcast
please check out my podcast while you're

[19:00]
please check out my podcast while you're
at it because sometimes I have podcasts
that aren't on YouTube and sometimes I
have YouTubes that aren't on podcast so
check out the ker office on any podcast
platform or you can go to TKO pod.com
also my newsletter will throw that in
there there are no ads It's weekly it's
different content than my podcast and
YouTube newsletter. chrisj cerner.com
You'll see the link and we'll see you
there here's the idea are you ready for
this okay this could be done on a small
scale it doesn't have to be a Netflix
show it could be done with iPhones okay
you're going to love this you ready for
it it's Love is Blind except one of the
genders it could be male could be female
doesn't matter are little
people and the other gender are normally
sized people and they are not allowed
the little people are not allowed to
disclose it and then there's a reveal do
they know before going into it
no NOP the little people ass the little
people assume that it's a show Like Love
is Blind only for little people and the

[20:02]
is Blind only for little people and the
other people assume that it's just it's
kind of like a Love is Blind
copycat and then you have the big reveal
and we will truly know if love is blind
when that reveal happens tell me that
wouldn't be good television of course
it'd be good television I don't know
that you more than one season though oh
you could you totally could do you
remember when we were growing up I mean
even now they have movies and like in
the movies is like the ugly girl or the
ugly guy or the guy that's gross or like
whatever I think about those people
probably because I identify with them
but like that would suck to be like oh
yeah I'm aov script I'm a movie star I'm
in all you know like Steve Bushi like
I'm a movie star and it's like ugly man
enters the
room Fat Amy yeah it's like you're just
always known as that yeah at least at
least when you're famous you have a lot
of money to kind of like console
yourself do you think there could be
some like emotional damage emotional

[21:00]
some like emotional damage emotional
damage for either one of them like the
little people when they're like wait
they didn't like me or for the I don't
know regular sized person
when they just feel bait and switched I
don't know that that feels to me like
you're upping the stakes and upping the
likelihood of there being even just some
just some mental mental trauma there
yeah is that going to happen absolutely
is it going to be me that does it no
someone much less ethical than me will
launch this business I would never do it
I thought you going to say like business
is blind it's going to be called love is
little what about little
lovers that's something else entirely
what about little bit of
love oh that is the weirdest I love that
you brought it up but that is one of the
weirdest the weirdest ideas all right I
got one for you great would it not be
good entertainment of course it'd be
good entertainment it would just be it
just be hard to pull off you'd have to
actually
the knoow and the infrastructure all

[22:00]
the knoow and the infrastructure all
right two weeks ago beautiful Saturday
80° here in Boise
Idaho and what did my family decide to
do we decided to get dressed up as if
it's the fall and go take family
pictures okay same we did it too family
pictures are awful at least when your
kids at least when your kids are yes
when your kids are little in particular
and they're not listening and they're
fighting with each other and then it's
like oh we got to retake that cuz so and
so didn't smile so and so messed up I
freaking hate it I just I hate it it was
much better this year than it was the
year before Nick pooped his pants again
we got to retake that dude don't give me
Taco Bell an hour before I'm supposed to
take family pictures that's what I'm
tacoing
about anyways I made a run for the
Border I'll tell you what anyways so
we're in the middle of this field we're
taking pictures and it just hits me and
maybe this exists but so I'm bringing
this
up I would pay money more money to a
photographer if they were like hey look

[23:01]
photographer if they were like hey look
don't even worry about everybody getting
on the same page and a few pictures I'm
going to take enough pictures of your
family and I'm now using AI where I'll
be able to get everybody smiling and
looking and if there's a specific thing
that you want like I'll be able to
surrender it or model it I don't even
know what the right terminology is but
sure there is editing technology that's
existed for a long time that could like
put a smile on someone's face or take a
blemish away or you know make your eyes
a different color
but the ability now of AI to generate
images of people is almost
indistinguishable like now I can tell
that there's a difference but when you
first saw it you didn't really know and
but now you're like oh the Skin's too
smooth or the hands messed up they like
whatever so my idea would be somebody
who's AI Savvy would go figure out the
optical software necessary and just
reach out to videographers photographers
family photographers this time of year
in particular I and sell them a package

[24:00]
in particular I and sell them a package
that makes their job way easier it's
just like instantly creates the perfect
family portrait and I think that they
would crush what do you think this is an
amazing idea and I love it and I love
you for saying it yes and I'm going to
edit this idea to where it comes from my
mouth when this becomes
published I don't care all right let me
let me do you one further are you okay
you ready okay yep just share your Apple
photos album with me or your Google
photos album with me done or you know
hey Mom curate some of your favorite
pictures of your kids maybe they're
running around the house in a diaper
maybe it's like a school picture I don't
care just share them with me I'll do all
the rest and then you just hey here's
the family at the hay ride here's the
family in a Halloween setting at a
Christmas setting at a everything
anything you want here's the family on
Mount Everest whatever you want it could
be goofy it could be real it could be a
western Saloon Style and it could cost
next to nothing and I love your idea of

[25:01]
next to nothing and I love your idea of
piggybacking on the photographers
because that makes distribution easier
but you don't even have to this is just
a website this could just be a website
50 bucks 49 bucks 19 bucks where you
just link your Google photos album or
your Apple photos and you just make it
happen and it just autog generates okay
I'm gonna level I'm I'm gonna take your
level level it up one have you ever done
one of these have you ever like gone to
AI generating websites and they're like
yeah upload 10 pictures of yourself I
have yeah and I used and I used my Apple
Google photos and the AI Nick was not
good it did not look like me but it was
because the pictures that I had just
weren't either consistent or like not a
good angle or the resolution wasn't
great Etc what if we brought back the
mall photo booths not photo booths but
like photoshops where you go and as a
family and take photos and it's like
instead of family pictures and dressing
up to go in the middle of the sun on you
know in a field or whatever you just go
to the studio you take X number of

[26:00]
to the studio you take X number of
pictures per kid and then those are the
photos that they use for that year
Christmas card right like and then you
don't have to worry about like oh I want
it during the golden hour so I'm gon to
make sure to get there between 4 and 5
and we can't be to early we can't be too
late right like so you go it's Studio
lighting's really good you get really
good pictures and then like you said you
use AI to edit it and you spit out the
family Christmas
card I think you could do that but I
don't think you have to do all that I
think you could just say like hey Mom
just take your iPhone and and get a few
pictures of your kids smiling and I'll
take care of the rest maybe it's gotten
better now I'm just saying that when I
took my pictures and I like took 10 of
them and I uploaded it and it was like
going to generate me the Nick AI it was
not it was not
good I think I think mid journey and
comfy UI has better options now because
I did a head shot generator as well for
Jesse and it was Jess's look it was
passable but it wouldn't be used for
this like J was fine and it that was

[27:00]
this like J was fine and it that was
like a year ago wasn't it maybe you're
right well e either way that's for
someone to solve right like either you
could do it and it's like hey you got to
have an iPhone 14 or higher because you
need this much resolution and and you
need to have these light setup or or or
whatever right like these are the
parameters or you can for an upch charge
you can come in and we'll do it all for
you family pictures in particular I just
I I freaking love the idea of never ever
in my life having to go do family
pictures again with my family
yeah and I will say my kids are older
than yours 8 10 12 14 and we just got
ours done two weeks ago and it was still
terrible terrible because my kids were
terrible no no actually they were the
the most well behaved they've ever been
but I was terrible because I was hungry
and it was taking forever it was taking
so long and there was always another
shot that she had to get and I hope
she's not listening right now because I
hated it
so this is just another unbundling idea
right there's a zillion AI headshot

[28:00]
right there's a zillion AI headshot
generators out there we're just saying
hey AI generated photos for family
pictures right yes that's it this need
this needs to be a thing I love it it's
beautiful dude and think about o think
about this if I told your wife or if you
told my wife hey hey you want to do
family pictures once a year or would you
like to send out a card in the fall and
around Christmas and in the spring and
what about a back to school card oh what
about the summer recap card or oh it's
Royce's birthday what about that card
like all of a sudden you don't need to
like once a year get everybody together
and have the family picture you can
generate them like throughout the year
without all the freaking hassle you
heard of chatbooks right of course yeah
shout out to to homeboy Nate Quigley my
friend from live TV I say friend I
really mean boss he was my boss he he
founded chatbooks in Utah big company it
could be a chatbooks it could be like

[29:00]
could be a chatbooks it could be like
the AI chatbooks right where it's like a
subscription because chat all chatbooks
does is it syncs with your your Google
photos in your Instagram and every month
or every quarter it will just send you a
physical book of your pictures it could
be like that but for AI pictures what J
does is like she'll go and select the
ones that she wants yeah you can do that
too yeah yeah you can do that too but
this would have been great for you know
my family cuz my parents got divorced
when I was 13 and we never went on
vacations after the divorce so we could
have generated pictures of us on the
beach and on vacation we could have been
an AI generated happy family it would
have been nice AI is going to make a lot
of families happy actually when you
think about it not yours but families in
the future
yeah all right what do you got all right
let's see I'm so happy you liked that
one so am
I because they're not all winners
woo what if like these episodes are

[30:01]
woo what if like these episodes are
actually 2 hours long and we just edit
out so much of them they land at like 40
minutes all right I got one for you so
zapier and make okay will you explain
the two of them that's what I'm about to
do yes sir would you stop being so
aggressive on my show I'm sorry
sir zapier connects apis from all kinds
of tools and platforms it's very cheap
on the surface it's very cheap make does
the exact make.com formerly known as
integromat maybe the most obvious
branding change ever make is like 85%
cheaper than zapier but does the same
thing but is significantly more
difficult to use you don't need to be a
programmer it's just clunky the UI isn't
great clearly a big company because they
have a four-letter domain name but they
do the same thing make and zapier are
the same company zapier is just five to
six times more expensive so you use
something like built with which is a

[31:01]
something like built with which is a
website where you can know what any
website in the world is built with and
you can scrape a list of every single
zapier customer on the Internet or you
can you know you can do cold Outreach to
them and many other different
ways and you reach out to them with this
offer hey why are you using zapier
you're spending way too much money on
your automations I will convert you to
make and charge 30% of the savings
because like our our zapier bill is 300
bucks a month I know people that pay
$3,000 to $110,000 a month to zapier
when their make.com bill would literally
be a tenth of that and accomplish the
same thing so you're basically this is a
this is your foot in the door you get
your foot in the door by converting them
from zapier to make you're basically
stealing customers from zapier and then
the real money is in being like their
automation go-to guy for a monthly flat
fee you fix everything that breaks you

[32:00]
fee you fix everything that breaks you
add more automations you fix the old
automations it's just your way to get
your foot in the door you could even do
it for free just to get your foot in the
door we've talked about the automations
and the AI companies before but this is
just like you're not even targeting
companies who may or may not have it
you're targeting companies who you know
have it can we debate really quickly why
do you still call it zapier why do you
not call it
zapier because I've been using it for 11
years and it's what I've always called
it so isn't it so funny like how you
like find these words and then the first
time you hear it after years of saying
it the wrong way you're like that's
wrong I don't care that they founded the
company they're saying it wrong I agree
with you but zapier anyways I know like
as soon as like right after my parents
got divorced Ron moved in and I just
kept calling him dad because it was like
that's my dad figure you know ah so
silly what's up is that too dark it was
too it was too close to home actually
but yeah anyways I'm not going to keep

[33:00]
but yeah anyways I'm not going to keep
going okay couple questions because I'm
like an idiot with this when you say
that builtwith will tell you who the
zappier customers are how does builtwith
work it doesn't just tell you who built
the website it also tells you what API
Integrations the website is implemented
for certain API Integrations yeah not
for everything okay so so it would only
catch certain ones yeah like for
instance your your website might have a
stripe integration like a stripe
connection or stripe widget or like a
Facebook pixel integration connection or
widget but it's not built on a Facebook
pixel it's not built on Stripe Right and
are you just assuming that it's zapier
like if if someone has a stripe payment
automation is there any other way that
it could be something else or is it
going to be through zapier it's like I
mean zapier has like 80% of the market
so okay so you're making but you are
making some assumption it's not saying
like oh zapier is okay cool how does I
don't know this how does a your charge

[34:00]
don't know this how does a your charge
is it a volume thing or is it like the
number of API calls or is it the number
of unique apis that you have on your
website does that make sense what I'm
asking yeah they charge by number of
zaps which is like an integration right
so if I want to add subscribers to
beehive from Google Sheets that's one
zap and then it will charge by tasks
which is the number of times it moves an
email from Google Sheets to beehive got
it on like a credit system system so I
could have one zap that has like
multiple steps that could cost like
three or four credits it's not
necessarily one one credit for every
test but for this purpose if I'm just
trying to identify the zaps that a
website has it's it's not also going to
tell me the volume that are being
transacted across that no okay no is
there any way that you could identify
who the mega users were right so instead
of just a blanket or blast you could
maybe tailor your approach to say like
oh I know this company's using Zer and
they're probably paying 5 grand a month

[35:00]
they're probably paying 5 grand a month
just based on the the number of
Integrations they have like is there a
way you could sort of get a proxy for
how much they're spending or is it just
you can't really do that it could have
one zap it could have one zap but it's
running you know thousands of different
whatever tasks across that and so they
are paying thousands of dollars but you
wouldn't know that because you don't see
the volume do you get what I'm saying
like how volume there's there's a lot of
ways you could infer you would never
know exactly but for instance you scrape
a list of every shop if I site and
you're going to say okay if it's Shopify
plus then that is a high volume Shopify
store by default therefore they are much
more likely to be using a lot more
zapier tasks or you could builtwith will
also tell you what their monthly traffic
is roughly it's not perfectly accurate
you're like okay I'm just going to
assume more monthly traffic equal more
zaps this idea would probably be for
somebody who has experience in
e-commerce who has experience with
creating or at least managing
Integrations with zapier it doesn't have
to be e-commerce
just somebody who would have the
knowledge to say like oh you're a

[36:01]
knowledge to say like oh you're a
Shopify premium store like I wouldn't
know that I wouldn't know that just off
the bat right but somebody who's in that
space or who understand e-commerce is
going to look at that and say oh in
order to have that that's a $5,000 a
month subscription so that's going to
justify the spend because they have
whatever the volume but I'm trying to
get out like who would be the perfect
profile to do a business like this
someone that does not necessarily know
how to code but knows how to use zapier
like who is technically Savvy enough to
know their way around tools like these
like Jordan yeah or like like me right
like I I think like like most people our
age I would think
me because like if you can code I spent
20 minutes today trying to get our VA
access to my Facebook business
profile well in your defense it's it's a
little tricky in there gets a little
hairy and meta business manager is this
thing on is this are you my
grandson no but like I think if you know
how to code then it might not be the

[37:01]
how to code then it might not be the
highest and best use of your skills or
time it would definitely be easy enough
for you but yeah but the the added piece
to it because you were saying like this
is the foot and the door the
implementation you probably would need
some level of experience creating these
zaps because it would it would be hard
to go into a business cold and just be
like oh yeah you should do a Zap for
this and a Zap for that and a Zap for
this like you don't know how their
process flows work you don't know
where and what they should be
implementing for their payment processor
you don't know where and what they
should be implementing for their you
know CRM or for their email software or
for checkout systems or you know what I
mean like you you probably want to have
some expertise in that space right or
you could use
AI I'm a consultant for XY or Z business
these are the tools they're currently
using I'm now as zapier expert or a make
expert what would you suggest hm I think
the hardest part about this business now

[38:00]
the hardest part about this business now
that I think about it would be learning
make because zapier is very very easy to
learn but make is a little more
difficult it's doable there are YouTube
channels dedicated to it but it would
take a little time see to me that
doesn't scare me off I I would just yeah
if you can get the demand if you can get
the customers then you can figure out
the Fulfillment either by going to
something you could teach yourself you
could go through Ai and teach yourself
or you could go to upwork or Fiverr or
you know anybody who has experience
with the make Integrations and just
start Outsourcing it and essentially
you'd have to build out a little agency
that you're then managing people but
you're going to do that anyways if you
had any ambition to scale the business
yeah can I pivot for a minute just kind
of a quick tidbit so you know how we're
all like oh you know blueco color
business is where it's at because AI is
not about to take the Plumber's job
right yes it's a meme it's a thing so
yesterday I replaced the light bulbs in
my boys room and this just normal light
bulbs and later that day the breaker was
flipped in their room and I'm like what
and and Jesse's like oh it's because of

[39:01]
and and Jesse's like oh it's because of
the light bulbs and I'm
like okay being a man I know that you're
not going to trip a a breaker from some
little light bulbs in like a a fan right
and she's like I don't know it's too
coincidental I'm like no you're right
but like that why would that trip a
breaker yada yada yada I was about to
call an electrician because I couldn't
figure it out then I just take a picture
of the old light bulb I take a picture
of the new light bulb and I upload him
to chat gbt and I just tell it what's
going on and I'm like what is going on
and it gave me the most specific answer
it's like certain LED bulbs have this
fault that caus them to spike in usage
where they're like yes correct Chris
you're correct it should not trip the
breaker but it could be a faulty bulb
that's sending the wrong signal to the
breaker so all you got to do is just
return the bulb and buy new ones I'm
like that just saved me 250 bucks like I
don't think AI is about to replace the
the plumber but I think it's going to
make some good Headway what do we think
I don't think it's going to replace the
plumber but I do think it's going to
make everybody more efficient if you
look at the trend of Technology over
time it has made

[40:03]
time it has made
productivity Skyrock Skyrocket because
now instead of sending a letter and
waiting for somebody's response I can
send an electronic letter and get their
response in you know a hundredth of the
time and so there are these like
incremental Time Savings that you all of
a sudden get back that you're then able
to reallocate what I would argue is that
in that instance now the electrician is
able to get get to the highest and best
use of their time now now it it makes
electricians even more important because
they're only going to be called out for
the jobs that like you can't
troubleshoot with AI and in fact it
makes me a little bit more optimistic
about the trade shortage that we have
right now it's it's something ridiculous
like for every five Tradesmen and and
Tradesmen I'm lumping in HVAC repair
electrician auto body etc for every five
that are retiring two are taking their
place
like we do not have the replacement rate
necessary to meet the demand for all of

[41:02]
necessary to meet the demand for all of
the trades needs moving forward however
if AI could come in and all of a sudden
reduce like just by doing what you did
it reduces Demand by
20% now all of a sudden we don't need
five we need three and a half and so
there's a one and a half Gap and so like
how do we how do we now fill the one and
a half Gap so I that's how I view it is
like it's just going to make us more
productive because it's never going to
fix the the like oh how do I rewire my
house there was an electrical fire how
do I rewire this like I don't want to I
don't want to have to guess and say oh
I'm I'm pretty sure chat GPT told me
what to do and then have an electrical
fire and your house burns down like
you're still going to want to call an
electrician who's actually been
certified in that yeah I think it's not
going to it's not going to take any jobs
or anything like in in the way that I'm
talking about but it's certainly going
to make us more efficient and I think
maybe one big takeaway is you've just
got to start rewiring your brain to
think I need to ask chat GPT just like
we had to do with Google I got to ask

[42:00]
we had to do with Google I got to ask
Google before I do that it's like I
don't use Google at all anymore I ask
chat GPT everything we're best friends
have you messed with either meta glasses
or Apple's Vision Pro I could see that
be you know being something where it's
like all right I put on The Vision Pro
and it's like hey I'm looking at this oh
my breaker is off again or you know
there's there's an issue with my car and
it just all of a sudden using AI in real
time is like okay take this off like it
could troubleshoot for you so then it
either significantly cuts down on the
amount of time that you're going to have
someone coming in and diagnosing or you
can solve the problem and not having by
not having somebody actually come out
and fix it so I I could see it with
augmented reality really really
disrupting things but the like literally
coming out and fixing Plumbing or you
know repairing your roof or power
washing your driveway like AI is not
replacing that like those are still
things that are going to have to be done
by people but the diagnostic that that
you're describing like what is wrong

[43:00]
you're describing like what is wrong
with it I think AI definitely will will
eliminate a lot of Need for specialized
services for the Diagnostics all I know
is that thanks to this cheap guy right
here there's some electrician in the
Northwest DFW suburbs it's $250 poorer
today because of jgpt so I'd say that's
enough that's enough data to make a
pretty significant conclusion here
Nick I love it okay thanks for joining
us on the CER off/ holdco Bros and we
will see you next Friday
