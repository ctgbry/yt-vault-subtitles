I think this is a brilliant business
model it's called local kitchens and
what they do is they go to an area they
find four to six well-respected popular
restaurants and they say hey give me
your five best recipes and we will
license them out in our restaurant they
take the five recipes so five
restaurants five recipes they license
them out they have it all Under One Roof
the restaurants don't have to spend a
dime they just get free revenue for
having a second location and then people
come into the one restaurant they go to
a touchcreen and they can order whatever
they want from five different
restaurants and they're sharing resour
sources it's a brilliant idea
