heard of this company the not.com it's
the biggest wedding registry website in
the world $3 billion in annual revenue
and they have a massive problem that
anyone can profit from I spent an hour
on the phone with these guys today just
trying to get a price to list my wedding
venue for rent $5,400 a month and it
took them an hour to tell me that number
which made me angry so I spent the next
hour digging up dirt on the company
figuring out why they were so terrible
and I learned some startling things my
friends I learned that they have an F
rating with the Better Business Bureau
that there are thousands of complaints
that the leads that wedding venues get
from them are frauds are fakes they're
not real so basically people aren't
getting enough leads so the knot is
faking leads so they'll keep paying them
$5,000 per month that is alleged that is
I don't know if that's real or not but
what I'm saying is there is a world
where you can compete against the
not.com by scraping all of their
competitors putting them on your own
website charging 0 for bookings and just
charging a percentage of any wedding
booked follow me for more business ideas
