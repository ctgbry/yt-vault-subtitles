look at this freaking thing right here I
just found out how much power wash
franchises make and I'm kind of
wondering why I even went to college
look at this FDD franchise disclosure
document from a popular franchise brand
six figures in profit the first year 10
years ago power washing as a standalone
service wasn't even a thing it's quite
incredible how far we've come in the
last 10 years these guys have these
proprietary trucks that allow them to
pressure wash a 3,000 ft house in 20
minutes flat that's not an exaggeration
