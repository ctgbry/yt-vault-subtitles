you've got to see what I found so a
while back I saw this viral video right
here and I thought huh that's cool
someone's going to make money on that
and then a few months later I'm here at
Lowe's and I see this some soft wood
that was just cut down and a couple
chainsaw Cuts $16 I'm sure I wasn't the
only one to have that thought I'm sure a
lot of people saw it and thought Oh
that's a good idea any good idea is a
good business idea and you don't need
permission you can just do things so for
everyone that walks by this and says
that's dumb $16 for a log the guy who
actually did this just did it now you
see I own both a firewood business and a
tree trimming business and $166 for that
hunk of wood is outrageous if I were to
sell this much wood as firewood it would
cost about two bucks and it would be
hardwood Oak that burns forever and this
cost eight times as much because he took
a commodity and added value to it
