look at this freaking thing right here
what a beautiful life lesson these two
girls are teaching us so the girl on the
left is doing the hard part first she's
moving the cups that are furthest away
and the girl on the right is doing the
more logical thing first the easier
thing first the cups that are closest
she moves first but who ends up winning
I don't want to spoil it is this a
torest in the hair situation no is this
a work hardest when you're young
situation no I got married at 21 and had
four kids between the ages of 23 and 29
and built businesses all along the way
and I would recommend it because of
Parkinson's law you're able to work hard
no matter what here's what this lesson
teaches us do the hardest tasks first
when you wake up and you turn on your
computer every day you've got two to
three things that are just going to suck
do those first and then everything else
will fall into place get all my business
