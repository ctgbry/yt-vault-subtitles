look at this freaking thing right here
the Surefire way to make money is to do
something completely weird wacky and off
the- wall day 67 of Genius business
ideas follow from more so this woman is
a bee expert and she teamed up with a
master Carpenter to make what she calls
the bee Hut and it's a thing shaped like
a beehive that you can lay inside to
meditate where the bees are humming
right beneath you as you see right here
now I don't know if people are going to
pay thousands of dollars to buy this
thing but I don't care because people
will pay good money to meditate in this
thing or to rent an Airbnb that has this
thing there's a lot of examples of
people paying a lot of money to quiet
the inner voice in their mind so I kind
of love this idea
