we were going to put your name on the
cover it was going to be Chris Corner's
presents million dooll weekend written
by Noah Kagan and T RZ I should have
answered that text man I'm really bad
about
[Music]
that welcome to episode 12 of the ker
office I had a co-host with me today his
name is Noah Kagan you may have heard of
him he co-founded a company called
appsumo a hundred million doll plus
company he's a regular guest on my first
million and he just wrote a bestseller
called million dooll weekend which I
recommend it teaches you how to start a
million-- dooll business in a weekend he
lives down in Austin I'm up in Dallas so
he joined me for today's questions and
answers and we had a lot of fun so we
covered five different things first
caller asked about his website that is a
second opinion website for dentist or
for people that just went to the dentist
rather he charges $47 to get a second
opinion on your dental quote second
caller wanted to know how to generate
more leads for his company that sells
charitable contribution services to

[01:02]
charitable contribution services to
wealth advisors so it's a very unique
industry it's hard to get a hold of
these Wealth Advisors we gave them some
good ideas there the next caller sells
mortgages to self-employed entrepreneurs
which is a paino that one didn't last
very long but we gave him some good
ideas on how to find customers like
myself who are self-employed and want a
mortgage after that we just grow down
for a little bit talking about Judaism
and Mormonism his and my religions and
then at the very end my favorite segment
was from a bluecollar worker that wants
to break out of the blue Coller life and
start uh side hustle that could
hopefully turn into full-fledged
business and I love this call because
this is where most people sit most
people aren't looking to make a million
dollars a year to start a big company
they just want to supplement their
income in a low-risk way that could
hopefully one day replace their income
that one didn't last very long as well
but I really enjoyed it and I hope you
do too so enjoy episode 12 of the Kerner

[02:02]
do too so enjoy episode 12 of the Kerner
office with Noah Kagan and myself and
we'll see you next week Noah Chris
Corner how are you
man at peace how are you I'm good I'm
good I'm having a good
day nice man nice yeah it's a nice stay
out here you're down in Austin right I
am I am where are you I am about three
hours North
DFW Matt Hannon here's the problem I
have so I'm a dentist and yeah so I have
this website my dental advocate.com and
so basically it's like a remote second
opinion so anybody could can log in
upload their x-rays fill out a brief
questionnaire and then I could review it
and then get it back to them within 48
hours just for like 47 bucks so I think
the need there's a great value in it you
go to the Dennis now and I literally got
a rot Canal estimate my third one on
Tuesday did you really so there's two

[03:00]
Tuesday did you really so there's two
there's a a Consulting Fe let me pull it
up I'll just show you the bills okay I
I'm not as price sensitive cuz I want my
teeth fixed sure just make sure it
doesn't have any my personal information
on it I don't even know any of this
stuff I just gave him money so there's
like that's the bill for the
consultation it was just a consult this
is through an
Endodontics it was 515 and then the
actual root canal thing ofama [ __ ]
they're saying is
$1,698 yeah not insurance That's not
including Insurance that's just like
what they're claiming okay so how do you
feel about that are you in pain or or
why did you need it I haven't been able
to chew on the left side of my mouth for
two years okay so there's an issue so
you're wanting relief right sometimes
people go to the dentist and they'll be
like you need three crowns right and
they'd be like I just went to the
dentist like two years ago and my
dentist didn't say anything about that
like I'm a little skeptical and even
just like friends and family right I'll
interact with them at a party and
they'll be like hey what are your
thoughts about this this too I'm just

[04:01]
thoughts about this this too I'm just
unsure about it and so it seemed like I
was just always answering questions
which is cool but I was like man if
friends and family have questions why
not just make it available to anybody
yeah so I started the website and
basically was getting like 30 to 40,000
page views per month just doing like SEO
traffic writing product review articles
blog post and actually doing pretty well
just from like a a revenue standpoint
like Amazon affiliate was paying like
two or three grand a month just from
like product reviews so it's actually
like outpacing well outpacing just like
the second opinion stuff but Google's
pretty broken right now I think so just
with the March core update it just
really smashed like a lot of small
Publishers and any kind of big media
site or like big company can rank but
it's harder to rank now yeah what's the
question because I got some ideas I'm
dude you have probably the coolest

[05:00]
dude you have probably the coolest
business I've seen today not even today
in like probably months this is such a
sick business pun intended okay sweet
good let's figure out how we can like
make it known to people so anyway my
question is so what are some cheap ways
to get in front of potential customers
or like how should I pivot what should I
do different or what should I continue
doing just to get the word out I know I
could spend like money for Google ads
what's the revenue of the site what's
the revenue from like the sales versus
the ads yeah so so Revenue so I'm not
spending anything on on ads basically
it's it just I mean from the affiliate
stuff yeah so from affiliate site like
the Amazon Affiliates it brings in two
to three grand a month the consults and
then the payment stuff the so basically
I just have to pay about 1 to 200 bucks
a month just for hosting some software
you know how much do your consults make
a month the consults only I'm only
getting two to five consults a month and
that's basically because I'm not
targeting so like the people that are

[06:01]
targeting so like the people that are
landing on the site they're landing on
the site for the product reviews right
so I I don't think the intention right
the intention is not there but I think
if I can get in front of people who
actually
need the service they'd go for it so
it's so I'm getting traffic but they're
for product reviews it's not for like
people searching for like an online
second
opinion this is so freaking rad I love
it thank you this is like dude honestly
such so so cool man I'm like I'm so
impressed cool what do you got for me so
here's my two suggestions number one I
actually think you maybe have built a
platform for other medical professionals
I think that's almost as interesting as
what you've done okay like instead of
thinking yourself as like the dental
person youve created a platform where
other dentists are doctors or it's just
in verticals you can now replicate this
business think about abso I could create
software or I can create the platform
that promotes software right both can

[07:00]
that promotes software right both can
work but like when I have the platform I
don't really care so I think there's
something interesting think about where
maybe even go abroad like there's Dental
there's like doctor and then maybe one
or two other ones that are big verticals
now here's the other idea that I think
is just as interesting I I think you are
have
your free question I think I would kill
all of it okay and it's only thing you
do is it's $100 a year and you can have
unlimited questions to your dentist to
this virtual dentist okay I don't I
wouldn't give free I can contact you for
free are you freaking
crazy so it's a 100 bucks a year and to
me I'm my brother's a doctor that does
Insurance audits so he does what you do
but for the hospitals sure and helps
people and he helps the hospitals fight
their bills down with insurance
companies yeah so you're that for a
consumer side I've actually been telling
my brother he needs to basically do this
model he's not ambitious like you are
right I know I got the ambitious Jee he
got the I don't know what Gene he got
he's a good researcher he's a really

[08:00]
he's a good researcher he's a really
good
researcher but I think there's something
interesting about how do you position a
way where someone like Chris who's rich
really
rich right would Chris drop so Chris let
me ask you would you drop a $100 today
to have unlimited consults around your
dental bills and exams yeah if I've got
especially because I have four kids and
a wife we go twice a year each right
that's a great Roi yeah will you sign up
today for my dental advocate.com I would
if he could convince me that I'd have a
positive Roi
all right so Matt I think that's
probably the disconnect of people like
me and Chris are like okay this
insurance covers some and then we're
dummies right or we're just we think
it's reasonable so otherwise it's not
worth someone like Chris who has a ton
of money like super rich doesn't want to
pay so I think it may not be a problem
but maybe the review stuff is the
opportunity and you focus it more on
that and then the question stuff is free
and it's just a leaden thing to your
email list if you're not making money on
I think what people Miss in business and
if you haven't gotten a copy of million
dollar weekend yeah highly recommend it

[09:01]
dollar weekend yeah highly recommend it
it's Chris Rod it actually I did ghost
riding I've received zero dollars from I
am not rich for million dollar weekend
only from RV part need to send you those
checks but I think what people get stuck
on is they get stuck on well I have to
sell these this Consulting but no one
wants to pay for it but they're doing
over this so you might want to think
well how do we focus everything on the
thing that's working right and reduce
the distractions on the other part but
maybe you can get these people to pay
but if they're not okay I would get rid
of it and then Focus everything on the
thing that is working and double down on
it
okay that sounds good yeah Matt I think
it'd be interesting if you reached out
to dentists directly okay and use them
for referrals so they give out a quote
maybe the customer has a little
heartburn and the dentist can be like
listen if you want a second opinion
check out this website right right and
if Assuming he's an honest person it's
not going to harm him to refer him out
to someone else that's only going to
charge him $47 only for that person to
come back and now want the $2,000 rot
Canal yeah right that makes sense have
you going through dentists at all or are

[10:00]
you going through dentists at all or are
you treating them like a competitor no
I'm treating it I'm like the advocate
for the customer right because I think I
still want to hold dentistry in good
light and so I don't want it to be like
pit the customer against the dentist
right like I'm trying to I just want
what the truth right and I think if any
with anything right when you take your
car into the shop right like you don't
know what they're suggesting right so
there's got to be a trust Factor but
again it's relative so what you're
saying is just thinking about it right
if you need one filling for 100 bucks it
may not be the best thing but if you
need three crowns two crowns are easily
it's it's well worth it so I think that
my only concern if I'm going to dentist
would be like they may get a little may
think it's a little fishy or maybe
skeptical regarding it but yeah I I was
even thinking because I I I love how you
keep talking about out scraper and
getting emails like if I could just get

[11:02]
getting emails like if I could just get
it in front of the people that need it
right like hand hand it hand a card to
everybody walking out of a dentist
office type of thing I just need to
figure out how to how to find that
opportunity yeah it's tough because
you've got great SEO but this is a very
times sensitive decision that people are
searching for right they're not going to
Google it on their phone in the waiting
room it and most people are just going
to get the quote and then buy it right
then just by Nature of how this
transaction goes I think one thing you
could do to get more buyin from both a
dentist and consumers is to put some
testimonials front and center on their
on the site emphasizing the ROI right
like I paid $47 to save 4700 or
something like that first name last name
picture maybe even a video or two video
testimonials perform super super well in
the landing page put it as close to the
top as you can because that's the most
valuable real estate so people don't
have to scroll right I'm not seeing I'm
sure you have some sort of testimonials

[12:00]
sure you have some sort of testimonials
on here yeah I see you have a tab those
need to go front and center okay and
then I definitely recommend using
something like outs scraper to try to
form some Partnerships with dentists
even just friends that you have and just
say hey is this even relevant would this
even come up in your everyday everyday
work right and get some feedback and
then see if you can get them to refer
someone shoot give them half of the
revenue right right right yeah I was
even thinking even partnering with a
dental insurance right cuz then you
potentially save for them too so it
could be a cool angle as well but yeah I
appreciate those recommendations so yeah
absolutely well thanks for coming on
Matt cool man all right we'll see you
all right see
you all right Riley thank you for
joining so Riley before I have you talk
I'm gonna introduce Noah Kagan Noah
Kagan has literally been blogging for a
quarter of a century it sounds a lot
longer than it is but 24 years right
2000 he is a co-founder of appsumo

[13:00]
2000 he is a co-founder of appsumo
employee number 30 at Facebook I've been
I have not been reading his blog since I
was 13 years old I've been reading it
probably since I was 23 though and it's
an amazing blog and he just wrote a book
called million dooll weekend and on one
hand I love the book because it's really
good and on the other hand I hate it
because it's everything in my head and
it's like kind of the book that I wanted
to write one day but he beat me to the
punch so now I have to think of
something else to write about we were
going to put your name on the cover it
was going to be Chris Corner's presents
million dooll weekend written by no and
T RZ I should have answered that text
man I'm really bad about that you know
how you gave me that voice memo that was
4 hours long and then I literally copied
all of it into a book into audible
that's it so be careful don't do that
sleepwalking and voice memoing it's
dangerous anyway thank you for joining
Noah we' happy to be here thanks all
right Riley you've got a just tell us
what you've
got sure I'll try and keep it simple
about a year ago I made a big transition

[14:01]
about a year ago I made a big transition
from owning an autodetailing business to
a startup in finance and so it's been
rewiring my brain to learn how to Market
a different type of business so we are
in the financial services industry we to
keep it really simple we provide
services to wealth management firms to
help with their clients charitable
giving and so technically their clients
are our customers but really who we're
marketing to is the financial advisers
and we've pretty well dialed in our
offer it's pretty compelling and the
hurdle really is trying to get in front
of more people and so we're growing but
there's always ways to improve and so my
questions are pertaining to one I guess
one last bit of context sales cycle is
pretty long our business is seasonal
because most people are doing all their
charitable giving towards the end of the
year in Q4 so we could talk to someone
in January it would go really well but
they're not going to need our services
until December or November and so first

[15:01]
until December or November and so first
question is some tips on staying top of
mind with prospects and existing
relationships and then the second one
just looking for creative ideas for lead
gen we have a few different channels but
I would love some ideas for cold
Outreach or stimulating referrals and
yeah how so one you literally were
probably the first person ever who's
like I'm going to tell you simple and
you told it simple whenever someone does
that like I'm going to tell you really
quickly I'm just like okay well done sir
thank you thank you how's this business
versus the auto detailing business it's
totally different I love it because it's
we could work with anyone across the
country or across the world whereas my
detailing business it was in boisey
Idaho and it was hyper localized and so
the things that I really excelled at
don't really apply to trying to reach
someone in New York City or across the
country and so but it's more rewarding
because we're growing a company that
could be hugee compared to what a local

[16:00]
could be hugee compared to what a local
business would be so it's totally
different but it's stretching me and so
I love it good for you good for good for
you to Live Your Dream yeah nice man so
a few just uh trying to few questions to
understand things so you bought it or
you started it I I just joined the
startup so I didn't start this one I
started the auto detailing business it's
called UI charitable
advisers I literally just saw a company
get funded for 100 million ion yesterday
which has zero discouragement it's just
oh what an interesting space so you guys
help wealth managers facilitate dafs
fiscal
sponsorships field of Interest funds
yeah primarily it's Donor advised funds
or daffs that's 90% of what we do but do
it I'm trying to make sure I understand
the problem so these wealth managers
it's setting up a daf for someone or
executing a
daf getting them to use us to set up
dafs for their clients
so got it the client a daf is basically

[17:03]
so got it the client a daf is basically
like a health savings account oh do you
have one okay it's your charitable
savings account and
so advisors are just a huge source of
referrals for that and what's unique
about us is that the advisor can
continue to manage the investment of the
assets and so they can manage it just
like they would the rest of the client's
portfolio charge their investment fee on
it if they want to make invest in a real
estate fund or private Equity they can
do that which is unique in the daff
space and so advisers love us all right
hold on all right y so how big is the
company or salees so far Sorry by the
way I don't know how much time we have
we can do more pleasant you're good
you're good okay yeah we got a team of
12 we have $350 million in daffs so we
we're growing really fast compared to
our competitors though like Schwab and
Fidelity they're in the $40 billion so
we're actually a pretty small fish but
we're growing fast and

[18:01]
we're growing fast and
yeah it was funny I was thinking last
night one of the best companies to kick
their is Google because they drag their
on some of these areas that I think are
opportuni like they gave up Google
Reader that is gone and I was I was just
thinking about other areas of their
business like they haven't updated Gmail
in forever right it's like the same
email thing for 10 years so I like the
idea you're going out because I did my
daf which for people I guess that don't
know it's sure you give you give stock
and then you get a tax write off on that
stock and then you can that stock NOW is
only used to donate money to charity yep
and so I did it through Schwab but it's
a pay in the and then I my wealth
managers are facilitating it through
Schwab right so why would someone do it
through your stuff through directly
through their Schwab account with their
wealth manager because most wealth
managers use Vanguard or Schwab or one
of brokes yeah so we offer a lot more
flexibility at every step of the way so
we can accept more than just cash and
stock we do a lot of donations of real
estate or private all business interest

[19:00]
estate or private all business interest
crypto Fine Arts and collectibles so
we're much better at anything complex
with how it's managed the advisers can
still use their own custodian so if they
use Schwab they would still set up an
account at Schwab but instead of
choosing from four different mutual
funds to invest the money in the daff
they can do anything that they would do
in their normal course of business and
so it's much more flexible from an
investment standpoint and for a user
experience for their clients we have a a
much better portal and so it's it is a
better us user experience the clients
like it and it's the same price of
Schwab so there's no friction from a a
price point either Riley what does your
average client look
like sure average account size well I
guess our average advisor is independent
wealth advisor so we don't work with big
box firms like Merl Lynch or Morgan
Stanley so independent Wealth Advisors
and that's our our target

[20:00]
and that's our our target
audience and then how have by the way
your guys about page looks like the
perfect family I've ever seen they are
in Provo Utah so yeah we're in Utah so
happy life anyone go move to Provo Utah
that's real content so I guess in
marketing you guys have it sounds like
you have a clear Playbook and you're
executing and it's working so my my main
answer would just keep doing that okay
and I know you're looking for something
new but I think something old is more
successful which is sounds like you have
a how do you guys get a hold of these
wealth managers currently sure kind of
four main channels and the first one is
hopefully going to be our biggest one
eventually but finding some formal
integration Partnerships which could
bring in a lot of inbound leads to
attending industry events so going to
conferences in the wealth management
industry referrals from existing
advisors and then cold Outreach I think
one of the big things in marketing do
you have a clear go you have a clear
goal for how many you know clients
you're trying to see or is it the assets
under management you're trying to Target
uh both yeah and then are you guys on

[21:01]
uh both yeah and then are you guys on
track for your goal this year it's so
hard to predict because most of the
business happens in November and
December so we in terms of generating
leads and having those meetings we are
on track but we were on track last year
and didn't end up hitting our our assets
under management goals and so even
though we were generating enough leads
we didn't close enough of those but then
you guys can accurately predict hey we
have this many leads and here's how much
they generated so what the actual new
number should be this year it's just so
un predictable because we could get a
$20 million daff coming the door out of
nowhere or it could be a bunch of
$50,000 daffs and so trying to predict
the size and it it's been really tough
to predict Riley if it's a $20 million
death what do you guys make on that and
how long do you expect that customer to
stick
around sure with the big ones those so
we we charge the way that we make money
is we charge an a fee so it's based off
of what's in the account so if they
donated 20 million and then immediately
send it out to charity we'd barely make
anything but most of the larger daffs so

[22:01]
anything but most of the larger daffs so
it's it starts at 0.6% or 60 basis
points for the first 500,000 and then it
works its way down to 10 basis points
the larger the daff and so I don't even
know off the top of my head what that
would be on a $20 million daff but
assets under management fee I think I'm
confused though so you guys line up all
these people but someone like myself
doesn't submit to my daff until end of
the year that's just when people end up
making their donations at least the the
large bulk of them I don't know if i'
buy that
because yeah I think it's like at the
end of fiscal year so you want to lock
in the tax
benefits I think is there a benefit for
me getting it in now it would be the
same benefit as doing it at the end of
the year but I think the reason why we
see so much at the end is because people
are having their whatever annual or
quarterly meetings with their advisers
in September October and they're looking
at how much they made this year looking
at what their tax burdens going to look
like the next year and then that's
what's pushing them to make a
contribution before the end of the year
are are you guys trying to get more
clients that are super rich like Chris

[23:00]
clients that are super rich like Chris
or like low rich like me we've seen the
most success with the higher net worth
just because our offering is a white
glove super flexible lots of creative
things that people can do from a
philanthropic standpoint it's it
benefits people in the lower income
brackets but it's more negligible to
compare us to Schwab if it's a smaller
daff but the benefits do really show up
with the high net worth people what's
high net worth I guess I say over
500,000 in a daff there's giving to
International organizations we see
people that will instead of just writing
a check to a charity they could issue a
loan at no interest so it's still
benefits the charity but just more
creative ways to fund philanthropic
Endeavors but it doesn't necessarily
make sense if you don't have more than
500 Grand in your daff pain points for
me is one my da is 12,000 MH so I don't
donated all my Intel stock cuz Intel's

[24:00]
donated all my Intel stock cuz Intel's
trash but then secondly the thing I was
sucky about the way that it worked for
me is when I donated the stock it
converted it into some generic like
balanced fund is that how it works in
all daffs not with us so you could keep
it in Intel we have people that donate
Bitcoin and keep it in Bitcoin it can
stay how you donated it if you make an
in-kind donation like that and you can
work with your advisor to invest it
exactly how you want to what are you
hoping to walk away with from today
really some creative ideas probably
specific spe Al with cold Outreach where
some ways to stand out there's so much
we do a lot of email Outreach and it's
hard to get noticed hard to get
someone's attention once we have the
conversations it goes well but it's that
getting that first conversations that's
the the toughest I've got two ideas for
you Riley one is one is very boring one
might be a little sexy so I love this
business because if you have a
million-dollar daff according to what
you said that's $6,000 a year that gross
profit to your company right 60 basis
points so they might stay five years 10
years so that's a valuable customer and

[25:00]
years so that's a valuable customer and
that might not even be the biggest
customer that you could get and so to me
that that means you can spend a lot of
money to acquire them and when I say a
lot of money I mean like more
handholding and so the unsexy answer to
this is just a boiler room full of cold
callers in Provo Utah I I don't know if
you're calling geographically or not if
a lot of your customers are in the area
because it's easier to sell to the the
close customers I just think that would
work and it's just a numbers game and
it's not sexy and it's the most obvious
thing but sometimes the most the unsexy
thing is the best thing the sexy answer
is research what brex did with their
growth hacking techniques they sent
bottles of champagne to corporate
offices in San Francisco I think you
should lean into your geography being in
Provo Utah like the highest density of
Mormons in the world and like ship Diet
Coke to these customers and just like a
tongue and cheek we're in Provo this is
what we do a it'll be a lot cheaper than
champagne B it's just funny and it will
stand out more it worked for them yeah

[26:00]
stand out more it worked for them yeah
and it's probably a similar LTV brex and
and you guys so yeah I like that a lot
we definitely want to dominate Utah
because it's just the most immediate
thing to to look at and we do pretty
well in Utah and there's actually it's
one of the highest concentration of
people that have we giving a lot to
charity and so it is a pretty good
target market it makes sense because
Chris did to I'm only going to give you
one
idea let me just Riff on a few thoughts
I think the number one thing I've always
done in business is like how did you
guys get your existing best customers
and where did that come from and how did
you get those Partners or customers and
literally just do more of
that I I know it's we wanted to try a
lot of new e things is fun but like you
probably got them through connections or
LinkedIn or not cold sure yeah most of
it's from referrals that have you really
gone through every single referral of
the referral I think there's probably a
lot more on that bone every everyone for
everyone including myself two other
ideas that I was just I don't know
goofing around on one is where else are

[27:02]
goofing around on one is where else are
those people doing charity things so
does that make sense charity
auctions because I think it's like where
else are people doing charity stuff
where they're like hey I'm this is a
benefit tax-wise oh there's other tax
opportunities it's more of an awareness
thing so I think that's one option that
I think would' be cool to just a lot of
times in marketing do it in the same
medium and the other thing I was
thinking is I think a lot of people
maybe when you're in the like Chris in
the nine figures but someone like me in
the you know six plus nine figures
including four decimal points yeah Chris
is European where it's like there's no
combos just dots the the other idea
there that I was thinking about is I
think there's a lot of an information
issue like for me I I love tax
opportunities so I love them if anyone
has some tax creative idea there's
there's a few lately I just think you
need can you send people postcard email
letter that's hey do you know that you
could save 50% in your taxes or you
could save $20,000 this year and then
maybe make it a little bit more Target
in your Outreach so like for appsumo we

[28:01]
in your Outreach so like for appsumo we
email Partners saying hey can we send
you a $100,000 check and they're like
yes I'll talk to you so what's the
equivalent of that where it's like hey
do you know that you could have saved so
for me I had like a $110,000 credit on
my Intel stock and the daap has actually
grown even though I've already been
donating it so I think there's an
awareness opportunity for you with very
targeted people within your network and
then maybe I would probably try to
pattern match these existing customers
it might be Mormons like Chris was
saying saying mhm but I I think it just
pattern match them and and then I would
be more
targeted yeah absolutely that makes
sense cool well thank you Riley this is
interesting thank you I appreciate it
yep have fun man have a good one see y
we've got Brian Summers next you
ready another sip of
tea you want to plug it a little bit my
baby to sleep yeah yeah let's do it man
this is fun it's interesting it's good
to get the brain juices full it is fun
yeah you never know what you never know
who's going to pop up next how'd you

[29:01]
who's going to pop up next how'd you
find these people they just through my
website they just messag me
questions oh really yeah you get DMS too
right hey can you help me with X Y or Z
and now I just have my assistant go in
and say fill out this form and come on
my show and I'll answer your
question so works out all right I'm
letting in Brian Brian how are you man
doing well thanks how are you guys doing
good all right so you have you sell
loans to self-employed people yeah I I
started with a company and it's one of
the things we offer and a lot of places
don't and so I just am curious about
creative ways of finding entrepreneurs
and business owners and self-employed
people what do they use these loans is
that what the number one thing you want
us to talk about is these loans they
mortgages yeah they're mortgages so most
loans they have to go by what they by
what they claim on their taxes so if
they ride off a bunch of of stuff
they're screwed when they go in to get

[30:00]
they're screwed when they go in to get
the loan because they have to go by what
their taxes state but these loans were
able to go by bank statements so we can
look at 12 months or 24 months of their
bank statements and then go by their
revenue if we can see that a lot of cash
is coming in then we can qualify them
with
that what do the rates look like it's
loans for kind of entrepreneurs yeah
exactly and self-employed anybody that's
self-employed and then my favorite
question where do you find where have
you found your existing customer so
mostly I've done a different kind of
loan mostly VA loans working with
veterans and so I was in a I was in a
company that specialized in that and
they would send out they would send out
mailers and we' get calls in how do your
rates compare to a normal loan or your
fees so a bank statement loan is going
to be usually a point higher than the
regular VA or a conventional and the
fees are similar so the first thing that
comes to my head is I saw a tweet about
this a year or two ago and it was

[31:00]
this a year or two ago and it was
someone complaining about how hard it is
as an entrepreneur to get a mortgage and
I've been self-employed forever and so
I've been there and it's the worst and
so I feel like you've got an amazing
paino here to solve one that it seems
like a lot of people either can't solve
or are unwilling to solve because their
higher risk I feel like you could go
through like Guru business micro
influencers to talk about this are you
legally allowed to give referral fees or
affiliate fees on these loans because I
feel like that would be sizable to
someone with 10,000 business followers
in the home service Niche if they were
to sell five or 10 loans for you that
could be a good amount of income oh
that's an excellent question I'm not
sure but I'll have to look in and see if
that's uh if that's allowed under the
current laws it it doesn't seem like you
would be competing with a lot of other
offers if you go watch YouTube
influencers of people like Noah you're
not going to see them talking about this
stuff they're not promoting stuff like
this and so that's either a good thing
because you wouldn't be competing with
others or it's a bad thing because it's
been tried and and someone failed at it

[32:01]
been tried and and someone failed at it
right Chris is all of your advice come
from Twitter threads is that what you do
from you read Twitter all day long
you're like I saw a tweet that said send
bottles I saw a tweet that you do
everything I know I learned from Twitter
that's kind of I'm on Tik Tok Tik tok's
how I run appsumo okay what who should I
hire Tik Tok done ticket and it's done
okay
ticket Brian so I I think this is Brian
how are you not a
billionaire because all entrepreneurs
even including myself like I have a
company it's a C Corp it's like
officially stuff it's hard for me to get
loans so like how are you just not
printing you just got is this a new unit
yeah it's a new company I'm in the last
company I was in didn't offer it and I
didn't even really know about it in the
old in The Old Company and so it just
seems like there's a an untapped Market
I think what's challenging is these are
mortgage loans as Chris was asking
it's like a very specific time for a

[33:00]
it's like a very specific time for a
very specific
moment right so how do you find the
people it's like insurance right either
you have to add something bad or you
have to there's some things that that
trigger the the thought to make a
purchase right it's not like a it's not
food where you have to eat three times a
day or something like that so I guess
how do you connect when's the moment
that an entrepreneur and where are where
do they go like hey I'd like to get a
loan for a house but maybe as an
entrepreneur it's going to be tough
right
and so I guess what I'm hoping is that I
become known as the entrepreneur the guy
who can help entrepreneurs so when that
time happens they know okay this is the
guy to call he's he can get you through
these through these Waters so I
wonder there's a lot of real there's a
lot of like mortgage loans right
uhhuh but I I I guess would they want to
pass you guys the loans they don't take
for entrepreneurs I I don't know I guess
the the areas that I'm thinking about is
when is someone thinking about getting a
house it's like they go to a mortgage
person right they go to a website which
that's expensive or they go to try to

[34:02]
that's expensive or they go to try to
get a loan and they're the loan person
yeah I just can't do a good loan for you
but they may not want to so one I think
they could pass your referrals but
that's tough I think the other thing I
would be curious about is right right
could you connect with more people that
have a lot of influence to solar
preneurs so specifically I was thinking
about are there
incubators are there accelerators are
there groups that have a lot of
Freelancers or self-employed people
making six figures probably or close to
six figures so they can even afford a
house nowadays but I think it's like how
do you get your seed planted in these
key
areas so would this be like local groups
are you thinking or places on the
internet I think you one of the groups I
would think about is dynamite Circle
join Hampton entrepreneur organization
YPO people that honestly have money
right because the some of the smaller
groups it's not that they're smaller but
I think you could hit up incubators I
would try that as an
approach okay yeah even Brian what if
you you just bought ads on like

[35:00]
you you just bought ads on like
lendingtree.com
right people go to apply for a mortgage
and they're pessimistic because they're
self-employed and then they see your ad
for the self-employed mortgage guy right
that could be your name that could be
your brand and that's to me if it's such
a problem which I believe it is as soon
as people just see your name they're
going to be interested before they even
see your content that's what Maya back
to Twitter I'm sorry sorry Noah are you
doing one more Twitter reference do it
like when I first started on well when I
started on Twitter on my newest account
I didn't start as Chris Kerner because
everyone wants no one wants to read what
Chris Kerner has to say because they
don't know who Chris Kerner is but I
started as the mobile home park guy
because I had just bought and sold 25
mobile home parks there were strip mall
guy there was Self Storage guy there was
no mobile home park guy so I thought
okay people are going to judge me based
on the fact that they're going to assume
that I know stuff about mobile home
parks not on the fact that I'm some
noname right and so if you go create a
person online people will read your
content through a positive filter

[36:01]
content through a positive filter
they'll have positive confirmation bias
as they read your content assuming that
you'll know what you're talking about
and they'll be interested in you before
they even read a word of what you say
because of your name oh that's great
yeah thank you anything else Noah yeah
there's a company
oo.com oo yeah sometimes instead of
making your own party go to where the
party is so oo has a lot of like
self-employed rich people it's software
for seiras and things like that like I
try to go to where the party is that has
my customers but oo has a lot of SE Ira
entrepreneurs people that are
financially minded that I'm assuming one
day might want to buy a house honestly
real estate sucks I'm selling all of my
real estate it's only one place but I'm
selling it I'm tired of this it's
annoying but I think oo there's people
there and I would also try to think I
don't know if your savviness is in the
marketing or the sales or what area but
you can also look at what they're doing
in their marketing area and then maybe
think there's some playbooks in there
for you to
replicate that's a good idea yeah oo.com
I think they're now called carry
money.com I think ESPN the oo stole that

[37:01]
money.com I think ESPN the oo stole that
domain name from him it's a
shame did he no I think that they own
o.com you ever seen was it
dodgeball dude of course nobody makes me
exactly well thanks for coming Brian you
gonna do oh thanks so much this is a big
help all right see you later
byebye oh nice dude I was in an RV park
on my honeymoon a few weeks ago
yo these places are expensive absolutely
these people are and I'm like so what
did you guys do like I literally just
parked like it's expensive parking like
everything is like real estate it's and
it's it was interesting business it's
like very low maintenance and if you
have desirable locations like
interesting exact 30% expense ratio it's
a great business is it really dude Mr
the I don't know Mr but I'm tired of the
software stuff should I sell appsumo and
then go open RV s absolutely you should
sell it to me at 100% seller financing

[38:01]
sell it to me at 100% seller financing
I'll take good care of it 100% 100% no
110% yeah yeah I need some operating
Capital working capital you need this
there you
go all right thing yesterday I say good
old Christian boy I'm like what a great
brand oh that is a no one ever says no
that good old Jewish boy that'd be a
good domain name I need to buy that
someone's buying it right now good old
Christian
boyom dude you know that would just sell
they would sell Polo and Like Water for
Grand for old ladies like you just bring
them water and you they sell it doesn't
matter what they sell dude why are the
Mormons competing so hard with the Jews
Like Mormons and Jews are the same we're
identical you and me but everyone loves
you oh well yeah the people love the
Mormons teach the Jews I need you to
teach the Jews how do we get such good
branding like you guys you guys have
like the best brand of religion oh jeez
I don't well do you send 70 th000 people
out every year to knock doors that helps

[39:00]
out every year to knock doors that helps
that's a good sales
team no there you go no we like you you
mostly hear us complaining I think
that's where you hear a lot of the like
oh look at Zuckerberg he's a billionaire
Sergey and Larry Google B like you don't
have us like doing the good stuff you
guys are doing the good stuff so we need
to send out salese number one pay 10% of
all of your net income to the church so
religious Jews do that the Orthodox well
do that sedc it like they'll give that
what what are you waiting
for I think also you guys aren't
partying hard right no you guys aren't
out of control you know what I mean like
the whole like not drinking no drugs
like some of the stuff that means that
you're making rational decisions
consistantly Jews smoke a lot of weed
they're doing weed they're like oh dude
let's make a movie oh Seinfeld okay this
is a microcosm of what our first two
callers were like they they come on and
they already know the answer the answer
like all you have to do is donate 10% of
your income send out 70 70,000 kids a

[40:01]
your income send out 70 70,000 kids a
year and what was the third one oh yeah
not smoke as much wheat and you're good
to go then we'll be even and then you
can surpass us because you've got the
media locked down we just have Salt Lake
you got Utah I swear and I won't swear
to thank you is the best one of the best
if not underrated state in the whole
Union it's like Israel think about the
Jews let's take the Jews we went and got
the worst freaking place in the world
there he is yeah the Jews why didn't the
Jews take Hawaii the Jews should have
taken Hawaii it's so much a better place
we're like let's get this little tiny
Speck AC like around in a desert like
why couldn't we take Florida just give
us Florida but the Mormons you're like
yo we're Mormons you're not going to
like us we really like just being
homogeneous and you have an awesome
state I'm it is a cool state but hear me
out Brigham Young could have kept going
and he would have landed in San
Francisco that could have been ours we
could have had perfect WEA Francisco's

[41:00]
could have had perfect WEA Francisco's
trash because we didn't going it
wouldn't be TR trash if we kept
going dude if the Mormons ran California
I would move
back I would just I would leave Tech I
would literally get in a wagon and I
go that's
amazing dude you guys would run
California so well everyone would be
happy everyone would be friendly it'd be
super clean you guys like like I'm sure
homeless the homeless are the happiest
in Utah sure hey Mitt Romney fixed the
Olympics we could fix
California I like I got a haircut in
Utah friendly there's a pinball my buddy
my favorite story of Utah ever is my
buddy Adam Gilbert he's he never drinks
I love drinking and we go and we're
drinking wine and he never drinks and
he's dude I'm not getting drunk I love
Mormon wine and I'm like I don't know
how you're not drunk dud we drank a
bottle me and you we shared a bottle
because Mormon wine is all maxed out at
4% Mormon wine that's an oxymoron if I

[42:02]
4% Mormon wine that's an oxymoron if I
I've ever heard one but do you know that
did the state of Utah limits the alcohol
levels of wine is he Mormon or no love
it my buddy mattam no he's a Jew okay he
just drinks the alcohol in Utah got it
we were on a GU trip we do a annual uh
trip together and that was one of our
trips to Zion okay that's where my dude
that's where my honeymoon was it was in
Utah you're basically a Believer you're
halfway there when people talk I just
read the Bible all
the picture Old Testament as well it's
the picture Bible so I don't know which
story you guys have so there's so many
books man like it's a lot of books but I
my buddy sent me the picture Bible by
Robert
Crum from Jesus or from whoever and it's
just a lot of stories man it's like
crazy stories they're wild really wild
St so it's like all these religions have
great stories I know we've got the best
though you got the best you got the best
oh man so I feel like we've helped

[43:00]
oh man so I feel like we've helped
everyone I like God yeah can I join me
too absolutely you're welcome okay and
even Jesus dude guy sounds like a good
dude he's just trying to do good
things they killed him they I don't
understand hold so why did they kill him
like he sounds like he was doing nice to
everybody and he was causing no
trouble they were intimidated they
didn't believe him they thought he was
Blasphemous he's bold he was too bold
for him
I don't know man if you let him do his
thing I
know dude do you think he could have
stayed alive or he would if he didn't
deliver his
message oh anyways wild stuff and I I
love all the religions I think it's
super cool it
is Brandon good how are you man thanks
for having me on the show good how are
you good so I understand that you're
looking for something to supplement your
income that you can take on before
having to quit your job correct that's
correct yeah I'm looking to build

[44:00]
correct yeah I'm looking to build
something up and then maybe potentially
leave the current job that I'm in what
is your current
job so I work a rotating ship schedule I
I'm an operator in an oil refinery so um
I've been Blue Collar my whole life um
trying to look to possibly make a
transition from being the worker to
being the business owner um I understand
basically it comes down to two things
you either have to have a lot of cash or
a lot of Sweat Equity
I think I have a little bit of both that
I'm willing to put forward before making
that leap but I'm having a hard
time getting to getting to know what I
actually want to do or is profitable for
me I honestly I don't think you need a
lot of cash or a lot of Sweat Equity I
think you just need the right idea I'm
on this like framework recently that I
can't get out of my head where a lot of
people call me and say hey I have this
idea would this work and I always push
back and turn it on on them and say is
that the right idea because almost any

[45:00]
that the right idea because almost any
idea would work the pet rock worked the
pet rock worked like stupid ideas work
it really comes down to the distribution
so question number one is this the idea
that I should pick maybe spend more time
thinking about the idea and less time
thinking about how to execute the idea
and then the second question is how can
I distribute this product or service AKA
how can I sell it do you like Home
Services home services are okay I my I
used to say us be a plumbers helper my
my uncle owned his own Plumbing business
and when I was like 1920 in college I
was helping him before I went on and did
my own thing but it seemed to me like
the stress of running your own business
he was running his own business and
doing the work himself and it seemed
like it wasn't worth it because it just
it seemed like the business just
consumed him all the time he I don't
think he like he didn't really trust
anybody to delegate his work to no he
did all the accounting himself stuff
like that so was really hard on him and
then throw a marriage with a kid in it

[46:00]
then throw a marriage with a kid in it
it's just too much at one time so so
yeah I was dabbling in that back out of
it I wouldn't recommend that just
because of the licensing that it
requires I feel like there's dozens of
other Home Services that you could
tackle that are as promising if not more
promising that don't require all that
licensing and training usually when
people ask me your question they already
are floating some ideas in their mind
two or three ideas so real quick what
ideas do you already have that you're
leaning towards so you know what I was
thinking about possibly buying a
woodworking machine and making like
Signs out of my garage because I feel
like that's something that I can do on
my own time give I could say hey the
sign will be ready in two weeks give me
two weeks and all sign for you and pay
it just you ever walk into an Airbnb and
it says Nashville like a b American flag
or something but these would be like
more Engravings so or like doing like
Live Edge for people or Co or whatever
for their bar sign for their bar
something you enjoy I do I do I've done

[47:02]
something you enjoy I do I do I've done
it done a little bit of carpentry
actually too with my other Uncle he was
actually a carpenter he did he own
cabinets for people and did like kitchen
remodels and stuff like that okay he was
pretty successful but another story did
all the work himself all the accounting
didn't really delegate anyone okay I so
I think I have an idea I think you
should go on Facebook Marketplace and
buy the tools to do this right don't buy
them new buy them used try to get them
at a discount try to get them at a price
to where you could resell it the next
day or the next year because these
things don't depreciate that much for
the same if not more right because that
at that point you're der risked also buy
a simple tripod I do you have an iPhone
I assume I do okay good buy a tripod use
your iPhone and just do me a favor and
film everything you do you might never
put it on YouTube or Instagram but just
having the content will be incredibly
valuable because that's how you can take
a business from 30 ,000 a year to $3
million a year by Distributing that

[48:00]
million a year by Distributing that
content okay I forget the name black Hil
Studios but if you enjoy Woodworking and
that's an idea you already have it means
you're excited about it and I can give
you an idea but the chances of you
latching onto it immediately are very
slim and so I I always lean towards your
ideas right whoever I'm talking to okay
that's not like a new idea which is
that's a good thing that's why I love it
you can sell them on you can sell them
on Facebook Marketplace in Facebook
groups local Facebook groups you can
sell them on Etsy eBay Shopify I would
just buy a machine used make five or 10
things experiment with it start posting
it on your personal social medias like
just not selling but just which do you
like best what do you think would sell
best what would you pay for this just
getting feedback and then these people
in the process of giving you feedback
they're going to want to support you and
they might become your buyers as well
and then you're not going to make a
full-time living off of selling to your
friends and family on Facebook and
Instagram but you're going to get really
valuable feedback that will help you
scale this and you're also going to

[49:01]
scale this and you're also going to
learn without any risk because you're
going to be able to resell these if you
don't like it or if it doesn't work
you're gonna be able to learn do you
like this because a lot of times when we
convert a hobby to a business we stop
liking it that's something that most
people don't see coming but it just
changes the whole dynamic it doesn't
always but sometimes it does so okay
I'll try that all right well yeah I
appreciate the feedback I think that I
think it's something that could work and
just it's I feel like it's a l barrier
to entry type thing my original plan too
was making things for my friends for
free honestly and just saying hey man
here a business card if someone if you
have people over whatever can you please
absolutely it's free marke hanging on
the wall
right that's another idea you just gave
me is start dming Airbnb owners now you
have to be careful I would create a new
Airbnb account because Airbnb will ban
your personal account if you DM too many
people ask me how I know or don't ask me
how I know
well it's smart though why would you not
do that why would you not do that and

[50:00]
do that why would you not do that and
these short-term rental owners are also
they also congregate a lot on Reddit and
Facebook so go find those groups offer
to send them to people uh for free just
for home decor with some sort of like a
QR code in the corner directed to you
right or to your website like that and
it's just it's free decor for them and
it's free marketing for you sure so
thanks for the information Chris I
really do appreciate it AB I know you're
short on time but that information was
super invaluable yeah just promise me
you'll follow up I will maybe I'll send
you a sign I would love it all all right
thanks man thanks Bron all right bye
bye all right that is it for episode 12
