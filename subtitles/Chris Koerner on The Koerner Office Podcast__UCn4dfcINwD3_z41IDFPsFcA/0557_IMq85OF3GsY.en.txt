[00:00]
how do you make the experience so great
that it makes it even harder for the
parent to say no the middle is messy so
either be the lowest cost option and
just be the Chuck-E-Cheese or go up
market and be the expensive option all
you got to do is put on a cold sock and
lose 80 lb like just come on but this
thing has like 10 million views here you
could also start a business that just
sets these up for existing businesses if
you're going to do it do it well don't
have a it it's made better by the fact
that it's new and unique and fresh
all right so let's do a new type of
episode today I'm going to call this I
genius as in genius things I saw on
Instagram okay oh okay okay
iusus I love that should we buy the
domain iius why wouldn't we why wouldn't
we I don't get spoiler alert I've had it
for five years always
have like the focus change on the camera
when you do that that's Prett good all
right so if you're listening I'm going
to explain what we're watching and if

[01:01]
to explain what we're watching and if
you're watching on YouTube You're Going
to see it on my screen so I'm going to
pull up a couple Instagram reals and
we're going to talk about what they are
and how we'd improve it what we like
about it what we don't like about it
like about from what perspective to like
get it more views or to if it's a
business no no no like from a business
perspective because these are all
business ideas basically these are all
business ideas these are reals of
business ideas and so we're looking at
them evaluating some of them are not
business ideas but as I like to say any
good idea could be a good business idea
so it's very true that's the idea like
religion yeah
all right let's see here we go look at
this freaking thing right here new trend
alert new trend alert this is blowing up
around the world in two different
concepts this is day eight of showing
you my favorite 2025 business ideas so
follow for more one for kids take a
boring old coffee shop the coffee might
not even be that great and you put a
Sandbox in the middle of it which
encourages kids to encourage their
parents to go to that coffee shop
instead of the other one how much does a
sandbox with remote control toys cost
next to nothing this second concept is

[02:00]
next to nothing this second concept is
the thing for adults for dads cuz guess
what I'm 37 years old and I would love
to go to the shop and play with remote
control I don't drink coffee so you can
watch this video and think oh man that's
a brilliant idea so I need to do
something about that and then never do
anything about it and then in a couple
years you're going to see someone else
do it in your area and you're gonna say
oh I had that idea I could have done
that or you can actually do something
about it with this full business plan
right here look at this all right we're
just playing our social media clips now
okay hold on a second I got
something and this is alloy to get like
four more Instagram
followers to the ones that people
listening who don't already follow you
on those platforms y yep all right so
for those just listening we just watched
a video of this coffee shop in Dubai
that has a huge sandbox in the middle of
it and you've got kids and adults like
just playing with RC Excavators and toys
in the sandbox and this was like an
insanely viral video the one that I
copied had like 30 million views on it
so we think there's something here what
do you think Nick I love that idea so

[03:01]
do you think Nick I love that idea so
again I just talked to to Craig Fuller
from Freight waves he bought a model
train museum that was going out of
business 880,000 square feet it's so big
he's bringing it back to chat
Chattanooga Tennessee and he is going to
build and like the way he was talking
about it he's like I want it to be an
immers experience I want it to be like
Disneyland right where you come in and
this isn't a model train museum like a
Lego set where it's really small he's
like the buildings are 10t tall like
you're in the middle of like you feel
like a giant right you're Godzilla
walking through it I think this I think
what he's talking about these immersive
experiences we when we went through
covid it fast forwarded what we thought
was going to happen oh we're all just
going to go to remote work and we're all
going to work at home and it's going to
be amazing and people are going to buy
online and we're going to get groceries
delivered and Shopify is going to go
crazy all those things happen but I
think people realized I don't like this
I like doing stuff I like meeting other
people I like doing things so this the
businesses that you just showed me it's

[04:00]
businesses that you just showed me it's
like I'm out doing things like okay I
went to the coffee shop but I'm also
digging dirt you know what I mean it's
not just sitting around drinking it's
experiential and so I like the idea of
coupling these businesses traditional
Services businesses with some type of an
experiential component I so I really
like it you could also start a business
that just sets these up for existing
businesses right it's like a Sandbox as
a service it doesn't have to be a coffee
shop it could be a restaurant it could
be a trampoline park it could be
anything that already has traffic that
would fit this demographic and you could
just install it and manage it for them
for a fee or you could go to the
companies who are already doing that and
say hey you you install this great I'll
bring you business I just want 30% of
whatever you like whatever the number is
that gets worked out right you become
the sales Channel and then start going
and finding local businesses that you
can implement this with and then you
don't even have to worry about the
Fulfillment or any of the work you're
just essentially a distribution Channel
totally agree with like the experiential
stuff we're getting outdoors more but

[05:00]
stuff we're getting outdoors more but
just on a more Bas level like you've got
a zillion coffee shops out there they're
all about the same it just makes one
extremely different for a very low
additional cost right like what's the
downside of this there are already
places who do this and like food is a
secondary experience DAV Busters is an
example of that Chuck-E-Cheese is if you
want to go back to when we were kids but
like DAV Busters food isn't great it's
terrible actually but the experience is
fun right like because I get to go do
stuff and and it's an activity so it's
kind of flipping that Paradigm right
food is the primary the experience is
secondary I I like that framework a lot
well there's another business idea that
I hadn't planned about talking planned
on talking about that reminds me of this
so I'm friends with a guy named Sherman
and he's in Utah and he found this
business in Saratoga Springs Utah it's
like a kids play area right think like
trampoline park it's got all like the
climbing stuff that you can play on very
generic when it comes to that but it's
very clean

[06:00]
very clean
they it's kind of like a Planet Fitness
model 20 bucks unlimited play per month
per kid 10 maybe even 10 very cheap but
the differentiator is like upstairs
there's like this elevated platform
where the parents can watch their kids
and they have like really good food like
very high quality food it's like a Wei
work up there and it's like really fast
Wi-Fi leather couches super nice like CU
you walk into a trampoline park and it
just feels gross and it's just bunch of
gross kids it's like a nice play area
for kids you know where else I'm seeing
this is pickle ball clubs where it's
like there's a pickle ball club and then
they have a bar upstairs but you could
it's also also like a weor you can get
up there and actually work out of there
they have Wi-Fi and it's a really good
experience I also like this framework of
deciding where you're going to go don't
the the middle is messy so either be the
lowest cost option and just be the
Chuck-E-Cheese it just own it or go up
market and be the expensive option so

[07:02]
market and be the expensive option so
it's like oh yeah yeah we do cost 50%
more than the competitor and we're way
better just own it otherwise you're like
in this weird game where you're trying
to compete on price but then you're also
trying to compete on quality and that's
a really difficult place to be so with
these experiential places these ideas in
particular if you're going to do it do
it well don't half a it don't make like
oh this is a homemade sandbox you can
still see the particle board on the side
you know what I mean like yeah yeah it's
very obvious it's very obvious so do it
well or hey bring your own excavator if
you want we got a freaking ditch in the
back you know what I mean like those are
the two options pick one of those don't
go in the middle well this place in Utah
is slammed by the way it's their first
location they just opened it and they
are crushing it crushing it yeah so we
should open one of these there have been
talks no I'm sorry but

[08:00]
it's interesting because you go to the
trampoline parks and it's super
expensive you pay by the hour and these
guys are just like flat monthly fee come
as much as you want and then they make
money on food they make money on socks
and all this other random stuff but
supposedly the owners have like not
slept since opening it basically because
they've just been slammed in a good way
granted Utah is like the perfect market
for this but in a way it's should be
like the most oversaturated market for
stuff for kids to do right dude fly out
let's go let's go do a video with them
I'm down that'd be a great video it'd be
a great video let's do it okay fine do
it tomorrow fine where's my ticket you
won't do it you won't do
it trying to put a chip on my shoulder
you won't do it you won't do it all
right here we go cold wet socks before
bed is Magic people also call them magic
socks let me explain so how does this
work when cold water is applied to the
souls of the feet before bedtime it
causes the blood vessels and the feet to
constrict it Wars the body the body

[09:00]
constrict it Wars the body the body
wants to shunt all of the blood to the
feet which in turn increases body wide
circulation and increasing circulation
brings oxygen and nutrient-rich blood to
the internal organs and the immune
system this can help improve overall
health and Eid in the same so let me
show you you need wool socks and you
need some cotton socks it's so easy this
could be done at home all you have to do
is take a pair of cotton socks put them
in cold water ring them out put them
right on your child's feet before bed
then take your wool socks and cover
those cotton socks with the wool socks
now by the end of this therapy these
cotton socks will be dry the body will
work hard to warm up those socks and
this is where the blood flow goes from
the
feet totally this body wide circulation
that helps to warm up the to and AIDS in
the healing process it's such an easy
therapy and so effective Tim Robinson
GIF of him
going okay so what we just watched was a
woman holding up some socks basically
saying get socks wet put them on your
baby's feet and then put wool socks over

[10:03]
baby's feet and then put wool socks over
that I'm assuming so they don't get too
cold put coldness on the feet and then
put something on the feet so they're not
cold sure got it check if they don't
call this cottonheaded nitt muggins I
don't know what we're doing here okay
anyone who's seen elf knows that
reference but like it's right there it's
on the tip of the tongue it's right
there all right so I don't want to bias
you I just want to know your your gut
take right off the bat what's in your
head right now I hate it I like I I
really do hate it like are you kidding
me are you so I have four boys you're
telling me we got to go freaking let's
get the socks wet ring them out put them
on the baby then put the wool over it
like yeah my kids's not going to sit
through that and then they're probably
going to take the socks off as they're
going to bed what is the female version
of Bro Science I'm just so like done
with these Bro Science like all you got
to do is put on a cold sock and lose 80
pounds like just come on but this thing
has like 10 million views here so I

[11:00]
has like 10 million views here so I
think people people are so desperate
they're desperate how do we monetize it
Nick how do we monetize this oh thirsty
boy
okay okay oh so the reason it has 10
million views is because people are
desperate to figure out there's demand
there's some sort of demand even if
entertainment demand what was the
problem in the beginning it's that you
don't have good circulation or does
circulation help you sleep she doesn't
even say there's a there's a problem she
just says it it helps with quote overall
health my gosh well yeah I would make
the problem clearer
obviously but and this is for kids it's
not even for adults yeah so maybe the
idea is to like to to Market this at
adults like people buy much Dumber stuff
than this right much Dumber stuff oh
yeah much Dumber stuff I would Market
this at adults as a parent I'm GNA guess
she doesn't have any kids or she has
like one daughter who's just an angel
but you know anytime you layer two three
four kids on top of it I just I don't
know how you do that it's like this is

[12:00]
know how you do that it's like this is
my child's bedtime routine starting at
6:00 p.m. we read books then we take a
bath then we take a walk then we watch
this then we Journal then we do our
gratitude I'm not done and then we eat
dinner then then I yell at her father
for 17 minutes she takes notes then we
change then we go to then we do breath
work then we do breath work and then by
9 routine 9:30 she's ready for bed at
9:45 she wakes up I go in there it's
like nobody has time for all that crap
so I would Market this at
adults the problem with this is like
there's no before and after if it like
removed a rash and it like clearly
worked you could see that it worked it's
like okay there's something here here's
an example so when I was a teenager 13
14 I had warts all over my hands ew dude
yeah it was gross I hated it I shake
those hands you do
know I had warts and it was super
embarrassing and I remember remember the
desks at school that had like the cubby

[13:01]
desks at school that had like the cubby
you put like a notebook and I would like
keep my hands under my desk cuz I was so
insecure by people seeing them I could
see that yeah and you will never believe
what got rid of them my mom was like all
right we got to get them Frozen off and
I'm like nope not doing needles not
doing pain not doing hard things washing
them was that what
got turns out there's something to that
it's so crazy I wash my hands twice a
day and all of a sudden they're gone all
those signs in the restroom have some
truth to them they're not just for
employees even though they say for
employees no someone told me once and
this is like the most Bro Science of the
9s ever but it was take vitamin E gel
pills right just like from the grocery
store vitamin E and pop them and rub the
vitamin E gel all over your hands before
bed and then take two or three vitamin E
pills before bed and then cover your
hands with socks
okay to keep the moisture in to keep

[14:01]
okay to keep the moisture in to keep
them on your hands and then go to sleep
fall asleep with socks on your hands and
do that for like 2 weeks every single
night and when you wake up you take more
vitamin E pills and I did that for two
weeks and they completely disappear
really every single one of them and I
tried other things like other home
remedies gone and they never came back H
so could you monetize something like
that I totally think you could mon War
remover kit here's a little warp you
know get rid of that little wart the
little wart shows up you're like what's
up little wart them little froggy bumps
those little you're like is that a
booger on my finger or a wart I don't
know it's been a hard winner anyways I
think like it's just human psychology in
the SMB space what's the sales pitch you
can buy a business for no money down
it's super easy it's passive Sil bullet
we all want it's the same thing it's the
same thing right like oh you want better
circulation all you have to do is this
one little trick or you want to lose 30
pounds so you can't prove prove that
your circulation is better if we're

[15:01]
your circulation is better if we're
strictly talking about marketing and
packaging it that that's I think that's
a really good way to Market and package
something is to appeal to the what's the
one thing that's going to solve
everything and then build and then build
out around there if I were to do
something like that water would be
something right now like microplastics
are a big deal your family you just
bought a steel drum or I I don't even
know what it's called we bought a we
bought a burky but then we switched it
out with a reverse osmosis under the
seink with a f a fky mhm I think
something like that it has to be
something like you do this every day
that people are reading about
microplastics that might be a cool
wholesale business that you start
selling those types of units so like
three years ago I bought a bunch of
domain names related to
microplastics and I just got an offer
for one of them because they're like
listed on like a domain Marketplace
passively I usually don't get offers for
anything but the domain them I got that
that I got an offer for is never touched
plastic.com and I think's or
plastic so like buying food or drinks

[16:02]
plastic so like buying food or drinks
that have never like not like not PVC
not a plastic bottle nothing what was
the offer for oh not very much but just
the fact that someone out there is
looking for domain names around avoiding
Plastics you know what's interesting I
so I bought a domain in a couple years
ago as a joke but I got a I got an email
from another company as well they're
they're a plastic company it's called
micro.com
and they want it cuz they they're like
you know no micro's and then the website
is no micro.com we're moving on from
this moving
[Laughter]
on all right I'm G to show you another
video to the one guy on YouTube who said
I'm too immature I'm
sorry hey he is who he is warts and
all you you look like the cat the canary
oh all right here we go
[Applause]

[17:05]
[Applause]
all right that's it that's the whole
video what was that I don't even know
what that was all right if you are
watching this clip right now you are
watching this on YouTube and if you are
a fan of podcast please check out my
podcast while you're at it because
sometimes I have podcasts that aren't on
YouTube and sometimes I have YouTubes
that aren't on podcast so check out the
Kerner office on any podcast platform or
you can go to TKO pod.com also my
newsletter will throw that in there
there are no ads it's we it's different
content than my podcast and YouTube
newsletter. chrisj cerner.com You'll see
the link and we'll see you there it's
clearly in Asia it's a maybe a
seven-year-old girl in front of like a
kind of like a claw machine vending
machine on the left side is an aquarium
with live goldfish in there swimming
around and she has like this plastic
scoop and she has a joystick and she
Scoops it down and then some fish swim
above it and she like catches a fish a
live fish in the scoop and then pulls it
out above the water and then moves it
over and then then drops it in like a

[18:00]
over and then then drops it in like a
bin and then we don't really know what
happens to that poor fish is it like is
it a more interactive way of buying fish
for your aquarium and you can pick them
that way they're really small fish so
you can't eat them so I don't know
what's going on here but it gave me a
good idea of something that could be
going on here okay okay it gave me an
idea for a framework as well keep going
okay so this machine is being sold the
Instagram account that posted it is some
random Chinese company that sells these
live fish vending machines and you know
we love vending machines around here
right I love me a vending machine never
met a vending machine I could refuse
okay that's good that I've never heard
that one actually so is it a new bit
you're trying it's a new bit I'm trying
it out we'll
see okay so you take that machine on the
left side is the fish tank with all the
fish and then on the right side you get
like a just a simple 10 gon aquarium you
fill it with coral toys it's Crystal
Clear looks just like a fish paradise

[19:01]
Clear looks just like a fish paradise
and there's no fish in there and on the
left you just have fish packed to the
brim terrible living conditions and the
kids Save the Fish well the the left
side looks like what we see in the video
right it's just a bunch of fish right
and the kids get to save them and put
them in like fish paradise they pay
money to move them over and then at the
end of the night when the business
closes down you just put those suckers
right back with the other fish
what do we think what do we think first
what we started what if we started a
business with dogs they're all in the
same 9 by9 kennel there's 400 of them
stacked up you come in you look at the
dogs you're like oh that dog looks like
he's in trouble you could save the dog
today so you put in the dog park but at
the end of the day we put the dogs back
in the kennel baby I hate that
but it I do like the idea of this
framework which is if you're a business
that sells things to kids
how do you make it more attractive to

[20:03]
how do you make it more attractive to
the kid and by this is what I mean you
ever gone to the store and your your
favorite child really wants
something every single time I go to the
store every three seconds really really
want something when do you give in I
don't okay I give in I'll give in every
time every other time but you know you
give in when you're like oh wow yeah
Johnny has a hobby that does this let's
get that or like oh it's a color he's
been asking for this okay it's an
Impulse bu whatever either way it's hard
for a parent to say no so how do you
make the experience for the kid such
that it's so great that it makes it even
harder for the parent to say no here's
an example if you're a Dick Sporting
Goods and you sell soccer balls like
leave some soccer balls like leave a
little pitch let the kids play soccer
with them I know that's not like 100%
feasible but I'm just painting the idea
here a Lego store have Legos out that
the kids can play with with the actual

[21:01]
the kids can play with with the actual
Lego set in a box and then after they've
played with it you know they want to buy
it so this is that on steroids right
there's fish you scoop the fish out you
move it and plop it down Daddy I want
the fish I just saved like how do you
say no to the kid after they just saved
a freaking goldfish in front of you like
okay yeah I guess let's get the freaking
goldfish you're right you install these
at like a petmart exactly you install
them somewhere that people are going to
make machine but it's really a big
upsell Ploy they're paying you to be
upsold exactly like going to a Alex
horos
conference 100% pay a lot of money to be
upsold you don't have a sales guy
walking the floor to tell you all of the
features oh this puppy's really good
because they're a good breed and you can
see what blah blah blah no you let them
go play with the freaking puppy for 20
minutes or you let them scoop out the
fish or like that's G to be a much
better sale than anybody trying to
convince them so I I like that framework
if you own a children's business yeah I
like my idea too though I do I do I

[22:02]
like my idea too though I do I do I
really you're dirty dog man you're
freaking crazy bro I don't think you
like FEMA's like not even going to
approve that bro
FEMA I don't know Emergency Management
Association I don't know I'm just
spitting I'm just spitting here all
right I got another one for
[Music]
you lost was fine set it from my
coughing How I died when you started
walking my life that's my life Tak my
earrings the feeling the night cat me on
youring all right tell us what's going
on here Nick I don't know every cut is
like half a second I don't even know I
know there's dogs involved and there's a
car and that and that it's like somehow
mobile I but I don't really know what
their product is cuz like it like
wouldn't stay long enough on any one
thing is this is this because we're too
ADHD or is this because they're an idiot
it's probably a combo I mean we're

[23:00]
it's probably a combo I mean we're
idiots too right so what is this this
I'm not saying anything you don't
already know
right what did we just watch a pink car
some type of pet grooming you wouldn't
know what's happening here unless you
read the caption so we just watched was
this Millennial woman that opened a
mobile bookstore it's this pink car that
she put bookshelves on the back of and
she rolls up to events farmer markets
conferences and she specifically sells
romance novels like very Niche but
supposedly she's doing really well
what's the name of her Instagram account
good girl books Knox as in Knoxville I
think she's in Knoxville hey good girl
books knocks you need to figure out what
you do okay cuz that video I had no idea
you sell freaking romance novels in a
mobile unit I thought I thought it was a
dog grooming business that you could
like read books to I had no idea her dog
was in a lot you had all summer to think

[24:00]
was in a lot you had all summer to think
about it you need to figure out what you
do with your marketing team so many I
think you should leave references today
it's very good that's a weird business a
mobile
bookstore yeah oh like a apple bookstore
or Amazon physical books so I think this
is interesting what if for instance what
if you had a mobile bookstore of
business books and you rolled up to Main
Street in Columbia Missouri and you
parked right outside the great idea you
think you wouldn't sell some books there
that's a great idea can I tell you
something I know I've mentioned Craig
but it's just because I just interviewed
him I asked him I was like he buys all
these media properties up magazines in
particular he focuses on magazines I'm
like why why do you keep the magazines
everybody's getting rid of print you're
keeping the magazines and he's like
there's something very interesting you
are indistractable when you're holding a
book or a magazine in your
hand think about that if you're on
Facebook if you're on Twitter if you're
on your Instagram on your phone bling

[25:01]
on your Instagram on your phone bling
notification bling notif oh I got a like
oh I got a text but you could be
watching anything but your attention
yeah is not necessarily fully there you
bring you bring up a book or a magazine
or you know something that's such a good
framework you're indistractable right
isn't it freaking great even though I
crapped on her video because I it was
just so confusing I didn't know what the
freak I was looking at I think it's a
great idea because you're bringing the
book to them they're
indistractable and you have their
attention and now you got to be careful
and smart about how you use their
attention but I really gosh dang it I
really like that idea because you're
it's almost like we've swung so hard
towards digital that people are now
willing to pay a premium for physical
experiences and this plays into that
it's a great idea you could work with a
major publisher like penguin and buy
their books at wholesale and just follow
conferences around like very Niche
conferences and only Supply those types
of books CES is going on right now
consumer
show show show there we go park out

[26:02]
show show show there we go park out
there I know they're like seeing all
these digital products all day and then
you just have a you know a book or
whatever that that comes out yeah you're
probably going to get a small percentage
of people who are going to come and look
at it but they're gonna people will come
and look at that stuff that's a great
idea
conferences business conferences in
particular man that's a great idea any
vending concept or mobile concept or
like party bus concept or food truck
concept that's on Wheels and different
and unique people look at it with a
positive confirmation bias because it's
Unique it's like it turns heads it's
like huh even if the idea itself is bad
it's made better by the fact that it's
new and unique and fresh that make sense
it is yeah it does make sense and you
can do something I think I think you'd
want to do something that is unique so
this is what I mean by it let's say they
sell Lord of the Rings books because
that's one of the books that I know
could I buy a Lord of the Rings book on
Amazon easily send it to me other than
it's in person and you're going to like
this mobile book like what else could
you do maybe there's a QR code with

[27:00]
you do maybe there's a QR code with
every single one of them that links to
something maybe there's I don't know
custom bookmarks like I just think
there'd have to be something else that's
like oh the mobile book place is coming
I know I could get this book on Amazon
but I like them because of X Y and Z
yeah I love the word indistractable I
don't think I've ever heard that word I
made it up wow he said the same thing
I'm dead serious he said the same thing
to me he's like it's a really good word
you're indistractable there's a
documentary about Jerry Springer right
now and Jesse and I were watching it
last night okay remember Jerry Springer
H do I remember Jerry Springer I don't
know is this your girlfriend's mom's
brother that you had with you kidding
me of course I Jerry spr did yes so the
his producer said something really
interesting you're going to like this
you're going to like this he said we
wanted something to be happening on the
screen at all times to where if you're
flipping channels with the sound off you
would stop
and like their craziest episode ever

[28:00]
and like their craziest episode ever
which you probably never heard about CU
they aired it they aired everything in
New York City first but then this was so
crazy that they stopped airing it it was
a guy that M divorced his wife and
married his donkey and brought his
donkey on the show with him and like was
French kissing the donkey on the show
and the still image of that was a guy
was a guy sitting next to his donkey and
it said you married your donkey like you
can't tell me if you're cuz like
flipping channels back back in the day
is the same thing as swiping on social
media yeah every platform just wants us
to stop swiping or stop scrolling and to
stay on their app it's the same
principle it's first principles and did
you realize that he was rated higher
than Oprah for a time I'm not surprised
I I didn't know that but yeah I'm not
surprised back then the ratings were
like if you had 2 million views per
episode you were solid so back in the
day there were like 20 talk shows this
is like late '90s I believe mid to late
' 90s and to get a rating of two as in 2

[29:00]
' 90s and to get a rating of two as in 2
million viewers that was like pretty
solid like it just meant you weren't
going to get canceled wasn't amazing but
but solid Oprah was at 16 16 million
viewers per episode Jerry Springer his
first show was like one one and a half
million viewers per episode it was like
okay and it was just like he would like
reunite people that hadn't seen each
other for 30 years it was kind of like a
heartwarming show which I had no idea he
started as that and then someone had the
idea to just go off the rails and no one
had ever done that before and they
described it as like the gladi the
television version of gladiator like the
modern day Gladiator cuz it was just
people fighting like on the stage right
yeah and he after after that donkey
episode his ratings were higher than
Oprah for a time which is like to think
that like two million is solid Oprah was
at 16 million Jerry was at 178 million
it's insane it's crazy if you're on like
Tik Tok or Instagram and you're swiping
you will see that principle in action
where cuz like 30% of people that look

[30:01]
where cuz like 30% of people that look
at short form video have their sound off
right so you'll see crazy hooks that
have a 100 million views like this one
common Hook is a guy standing in the
middle of a road with a rope tied around
his neck and arm and the other end of
the Rope is tied to a car and the car
will be speeding away from him and like
so the the assumption is this guy's
about to get thrown backwards CU he's
tied to the car and you will not scroll
p pass that if you see it and so people
are just doing more and more outlandish
things to stop the scroll and it's just
that's humans it's first principles I
actually didn't make up the word
indistractable but I thought that was a
really interesting framework that he
gave which is like I'm he's not going to
go away from the magazine because people
are indistractable like they're they're
100% focused on it so somehow bringing
these types of businesses into the real
world whether it's through a community
whether it's a product that kind of
floats around I I really like it or like
you said it could be like all signed

[31:00]
you said it could be like all signed
copies like something unique about the
book like a a limited print or first
edition or something that would be even
better you know who Scott Galloway is I
heard him talking recently about and
maybe it wasn't Scott Galloway I don't
know they all run together but he was
talking about that our economy is an
addiction economy he's like look at the
biggest companies of all time you've got
pharmaceutical companies tobacco
companies that selling cigarettes well
that was his point is like Google
Facebook Apple
they are trying to get your attention
they're trying to keep you addicted to
the product like we're in we're an
addiction economy and in this instance
your attention is what they're trying to
capture right and I think it's
interesting to think about ways to bring
people off platform ways to get people
to focus on you and be you know to not
be distracted the first idea that we
talked about where they're the Tonka
trucks that are digging in the sand
you're IND distractible right like
you're focused laser focused 100% on
digging that hole or whatever so

[32:02]
digging that hole or whatever so
creating environments where you can be
laser focused and not distracted I think
is a is a good framework to think about
for businesses that are bringing people
in to their product I saw something
online where someone was talking crap
about parents like you and I frankly
that I mean any any parent is on their
phone around their kids occasionally
right some of us more than others and I
try to be conscious about it when my
kids are with me around me I try to be
off my phone less very hard
but it's tough and it's an addiction but
I was reading like back in the 50s 60s
7s it was the same thing it was just the
newspaper like the dad would get home
from work he would sit in the armchair
he would open the newspaper Dad look
what I did at school today and he's just
in like it's first principles we're
humans we're creatures of habit we get
addicted to stuff so I spent two hours
wrestling with my kids last night and
I've been I mean it's stupid but I've
been trying to when I get home put my
phone away and just wrestle cuz it's cuz
is like they're only going to be young
for a small period of time and I don't

[33:01]
for a small period of time and I don't
want them to make like to do an
imitation of me looking at my phone or
on my phone or like whatever that is so
I do try to make time to mess around
with them but I was sweating dude it was
a freaking workout my kids are getting
big it's a
problem all right what you think please
share it with a friend and we'll see you
next time on the ker office
