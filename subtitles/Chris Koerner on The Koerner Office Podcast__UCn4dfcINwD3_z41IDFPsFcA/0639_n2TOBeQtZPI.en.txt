look at this freaking thing right here
I'm driving in Eastern Tennessee and I
see this car in front of me right there
buy the Bri drink ven Mo at t628 I kind
of love this because what do they have
to lose now am I going to buy her a
drink no but what I do support is
capitalism and if you're going to drive
a $50,000 vehicle around that likely has
a 4 to $800 a month payment why not
shoot your shot what are your needs what
are your dreams College two for20 deal
at Applebee's diapers Dr Pepper zero
money it doesn't matter throw your venmo
up on the car and shoot your dang shot
