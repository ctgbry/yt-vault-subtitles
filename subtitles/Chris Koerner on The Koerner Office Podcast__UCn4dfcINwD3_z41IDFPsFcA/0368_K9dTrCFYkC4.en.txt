look at this freaking thing right here
you know what this is this is your next
business here's exactly how I launched
this business this is called a nail
board and right now they're only sold in
France these things are brilliant
because it enables women to see all of
the potential nail options all at once
without having to flip through a fan
board or keychain what you see here is a
lot more aesthetic you can see more
nails in one place they're not handled
as much so there's far less germs but
here's the kicker in France they're
selling these things for $600 and all it
is is a sheet of composite board with
some Plexi glass over it that's it you
can make this in your garage guess how
many nail salons there are in the US
53,000 and if you want recurring Revenue
you can sell the nail inserts to go in
the boards as well or you can upsell
better lighting to go on the wall one of
my favorite Frameworks is to take a
brilliant idea from overseas and bring
it here if I were you I'd go make some
of these in your garage go give them out
for free to some nail salons in your
area and make them promise that they
will keep track of how their sales are
affected by this board and then you use
the increased sales numbers as your
sales pitch to sell these boards to
anyone that'll listen the full business
plan is free right here
