look at this freaking thing right here
this mom in New Zealand charges up to
$700 for this service I'm going to tell
you exactly what this is and how you can
profit from it the market you are
selling to is the best Market to sell to
and who's that decision-making moms they
have power over the checkbook and they
talk to their friends and they're in
Facebook groups offer 20% off if they
post about it on social media and you
will have leads for days this is called
hand casting and it costs from $3 to
$700 the profit margins are about 80% it
can't really be shipped online which is
why I love the idea so much that means
you'll never have too much competition
in no matter where you are you've got to
buy the right materials you got to
practice a few times on your kids or on
yourselves and then start talking to
your friends about it better yet don't
just do this for kids do this for pets
there are more dogs than kids in the US
and people spend thousands per year on
their dogs these videos go viral because
you keep watching to the end until you
can see the final result full business
plan here
