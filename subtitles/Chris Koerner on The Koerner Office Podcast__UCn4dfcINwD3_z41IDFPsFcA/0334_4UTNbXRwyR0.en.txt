at any given moment so we can hate
McDonald's all we want but their hands

until today starting today McDonald's
can hire any individual or company or
side Hustler they want to come fix their
broken ice cream machines do you think
local franchises will pay for this
absolutely they don't want their

$200 a month to keep these things
working that's 20 grand a month to you
for fixing these dumb ice cream machines
and if you don't jump on this someone
