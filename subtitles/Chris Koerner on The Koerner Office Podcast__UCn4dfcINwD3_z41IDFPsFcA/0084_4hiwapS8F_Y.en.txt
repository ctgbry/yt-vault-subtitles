this Texas neighborhood boggles my mind
this would be the second largest Flyin
neighborhood in the country 400 Lots
with Runway access it's on 4200 Acres
with 4,000 homes it has an 18-hole golf
course and what about the cost direct
access Lots will run
$400,000 I actually love the concept of
flying neighborhoods and they're about
to become a ton more popular oh your
neighborhood has a pool that's cute no
5,000 ft air strip location location Lo
location right no if you buy a cheap
remote plot of land and add an airst
strip it suddenly makes any location a
lot more attractive can't be cheap
though follow me for more cool real
estate stuff like this
