all right so I just upgraded to open ai's operator
plan their their Pro Plan $200 a month and I want
to see what it's capable of I just spent some time
playing around with it on Facebook Marketplace
it kind of blew my mind so I thought okay I
got to hit record on loom and let's see what
this is capable of and I'll show you guys what I
learned as you learn it too so I want to see if
the operator can go message people in the Dallas
Fort Worth area offering to charge them money to
pick up their free piano this is a business
model I tweeted about it a little while ago
I'm intrigued by it the model is this every day
40 to 60 people in DFW list a piano on Facebook
Marketplace that is free because these things are
liabilities they don't know how to get rid of them
they weigh 600b and so there's a very lesser known
business model of guys that will line up a whole
bunch of pianos in the same day they'll go rent a
U-Haul for 50 bucks plus 75 cents a mile they'll
charge 250 bucks per piano they'll load up the
U-Haul take it to the dump and throw away the

[01:00]
piano yes I know it sounds terrible throwing away
these beautiful musical instruments but at the end
of the day nobody wants these things ideally yes
we donate them to a good cause nobody wants them
so we got to do something with them all right so
let's monetize it here's what my prompt is going
to be I want you to open Facebook Marketplace
search the DFW metroplex for pianos that have
a Max price of 0 then I want you to message the
seller offering them to pick them up for a $200
fee let's see what it does okay let's just see
what it does okay so it's already logged into my
Facebook account I did that before hitting record
it wants to make sure that I'm paying attention
because Facebook has sensitive data and it doesn't
want me to walk away from compu the computer
but there are ways around this so it's opening
Facebook Marketplace this is my personal Facebook

[02:05]
account let's see what it searches okay would
have preferred it to search piano instead of
plural but I'm sure it's still fine it's going
to set a Max price for $0 that will ensure that
every piano that's listed is free and surely it's
going to do something funky here but that's part
of the fun of it okay so it's paused I found a
listing there are items for pickup in crowdly test
would you like me to message the seller with your
offer to pick a piano for a $200 fee Let's test
it how far away is Crowley from Plano Texas
now here we're treating it like good old chat
GPT oh wow it's opening another tab that's very
interesting to me that it isn't pulling on and
it's using Bing I guess that makes sense with the
Microsoft okay yes you can message anyone within
7 25 miles of Plano go ahead and ask them as well
as everyone else I will come okay I don't want to

[03:14]
say that because that might dissuade them see
what it does let's see what happens also I did
buy the domain names piano movers.com because I
think someone needs to do this as a standalone
business all right so would you like me to
send it I've heard people talk about how the
operator won't message people like it will not
communicate with people but I think it's going
to do it boom sent okay this is actually crazy
to me this is acting like a virtual assistant
or like a actual in-person assistant it's doing
this menial low-level task for me but it's also
thinking as it does it pickup only you will
need a truck to pick those items up okay it's
highlighting the standardized message it's pasting
in mind oh man this is amazing should I send it

[04:03]
yes let's see if it actually listens to me because
there might be some guard rails in place Sending
message I'm going to take it a step further here
in a minute I'm going to have it log all of these
in a spreadsheet all by itself so while it does
this I'm going to go to this spreadsheet entitled
operator there's nothing in it it's completely
bra blank and let's see if it listens to me and
it sends this without my permission it did it
it is communicating with people without my input
or permission this is amazing please log all of
these in a spreadsheet in this spreadsheet make
appropriate columns so now I'm going to ask it
to do something totally different from what it's
doing now it's going to make a spreadsheet for me
and it's going to log these items so video is cool

[05:01]
but you know what's better long form audio via
podcast and my newsletter TKO pod.com go there to
subscribe for free to my newsletter it's one email
a week very tactical 1500 words per email and then
go to my audio podcast three episodes a week stuff
like this you're going to love it all free no
sleazy sales [ __ ] TKO pod.com this is so crazy
to me that these people that I'm messaging are one
of the first people in the history of the world
to unknowingly have a conversation with artificial
intelligence this is absolutely incredible pianos
of all things who would have thought okay now here
you can see in the window what it's doing in my
Google sheet and if I go to my Google sheet it's
just it looks like an actual humans in here look
at that freaking amazing oh my gosh this is so
cool 60 pianos a day let's say 50 let's say 10%
of them agree that's a day okay so let's say 40

[06:00]
40 * 7 280 listed a week let's say 10% of
them agree to have it come picked up for 200
bucks because they got to do something with it
especially if they're moving it has to go that's
28 people a week agreeing to pay $200 that's
$5,600 a week okay you're going to have some cost
some gas and labor those pianos are not light that
could be a six-figure business that is primarily
run by AI now granted you know the low-level stuff
is done by AI the heavy stuff is done by by me but
man alive look at this it's making a spreadsheet
to resume okay yada y yada May conflict with your
instructions Mark safe so if I navigate away from
this tab it's going to pause after a few seconds
or 30 seconds a minute I don't know but I can
always have this open in my other monitor right
over there now but it's not adding the link to
the listings don't forget to add the link to each

[07:03]
listing okay what's it going to do it's adding the
links it's going back is it the right one pianos
organs office kids desk that's the first one oh
man it's freaking doing it and then I'm going to
go a step further I'm going to say can you monitor
these messages and add a new column with a check
box and check the box if someone responds do yeah
let's just let's just start with that if I were
to launch this business today I would literally
hire a virtual assistant and pay them $4 to $8 an
hour to do exactly what this AI is doing right
here I don't know why it put nothing in column
A that is a little curious but add check boxes
response received what's interesting to me is

[08:05]
it's behaving just like a human all right where's
the checkbox it seems to be thinking a good bit
here oh man it's going a step further
okay I thought I was going to do like a
drop down response it's just kind of doing
the the more tedious way of adding a check
box and it's checking the Box even though
a response isn't received leave the Box
unchecked oh my gosh it looks like
I might have a message it looks like
I might have a message this is so
cool I'm not literally on the edge
of my seat but I'm figuratively
on the edge of my seat right now

[09:00]
now it never unchecked the boxes so it's
telling me it needs a pin but it
doesn't it just needs to click on
Marketplace there it is it's freaking amazing
okay look at that someone responded we are
giving things away I don't want to pay
to haul them off he responded to AI
yeah you're doing it the opposite way check
the box if they respond and leave unchecked
otherwise Oh Derek if you only knew wa
what are you doing what are you doing
here it's kind of freaking me out because
it's like sometimes when I'm working click
on the wrong thing click on the wrong I'm just
distracted it's almost like it's acting like
it has ADHD maybe is this is this a parallel
universe and this is a digital representation

[10:05]
of me okay it's not unchecking the boxes but my
mind is sufficiently blown we've been recording
this for 15 minutes and we got someone to respond
and We messaged three people and it could keep
doing this it could do this all night so I don't
even know where to go but I hope that this excites
you and uh TKO pod.com to join my newsletter
so you can learn about this stuff in real time
