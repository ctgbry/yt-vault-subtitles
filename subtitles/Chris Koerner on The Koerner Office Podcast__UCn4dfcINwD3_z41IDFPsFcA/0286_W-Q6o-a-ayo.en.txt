[00:00]
okay as promised this is part two of
Connor's episode from last week if you
missed it go back and listen and today
we're talking about starting an
endurance product that you could sell to
athletes that only has two ingredients
we're talking about an AB testing Agency
for podcasters and YouTubers we're
talking about the importance of
packaging and framing ideas differently
and then we're talking about selling
market research reports and a gym for
personal trainers right so kind of like
a Wei workor for gyms for personal
trainers because right now personal
trainers teach in someone else's gym and
the customers are tied to the gym so the
trainers can't they don't have full
autonomy over their customers I think
it's a good idea
[Music]
enjoy we've got the $1 million year idea
business and I've got two 10 million one
is capex heavy like you're going to need
money to start this business and one I
think is not where are we going why
don't you just pick one that you're
especially excited about if money wasn't
an issue I think I would only sell
health related products

[01:00]
health related products
and like the food and supplement space
Etc and I have this idea for one that I
think is good that I haven't seen on the
market yet and I've been doing it
already and I love it and it's
essentially workout honey and I don't
like there are Goos there are little
like packets and stuff none of them are
like this and so maybe I'm finding a
niche of a niche but something that I've
been doing before every workout and I
think it's great I think you get really
quick energy you get a ton of blood flow
you get a great out of it is I already
love it I take a big scoop of raw honey
and I put a ton of like big sea salt
flakes on it and then I'll go to the gym
and I'll do like one or two of those and
I'll go to the gym and especially this
is if I'm going to the gym at night
where I'm like I don't want caffeine
after 6 PM but I do want something that
gives me that extra push I'll do that
and I swear it works incredibly well you
get the extra carbs and the sugar from
the honey the salt helps you get better
blood flow to the musles there are
plenty of studies out there that better
pumps pumps are essentially just all the
muscle flowing into your oh sorry the
blood slowing into your muscle better

[02:01]
blood slowing into your muscle better
pumps lead to better gains there's a
good deal of research the fact is that
it's entirely natural it's not
caffeinated you can package these things
up in really little easy to consume goo
packets that you can TOS in a backpack
pocket fanny pack carard door whatever I
want it for myself which is why I think
that there's a market out there but I
also know it's a crazy competitive
market and so curious your take on this
I love it I love this take it reminds me
of the like I just sometimes I hear and
you don't even finish the first sentence
and I'm like yep I'm in where do I write
the check yeah and it's like this is
something that maybe 80% of investors be
like this stupid there's nothing
proprietary yeah but it reminds me of
the of our dog electrolyte idea it's so
it's like new salt is literally it's you
can go buy it at Walmart today it's 50%
potassium 50% sodium which is basically
half of electrolytes right so it's like
okay I'm going to go find the guy that
makes new salt I'm going to say hey put
this label on it put a picture of a dog
on it we're going to sell it through
chewy.com right what you can't do that

[03:01]
chewy.com right what you can't do that
it's like no you can right you can we're
just repackaging something that we're
not the first PE people to do this so I
look at this as a runner as a cyclist I
don't eat the goose because they make me
throw up they're disgusting I don't even
like honey but I like the fact that I
know what it is assuming there's a lot
of fake honey out there assuming it's
real honey yeah I was going to say like
the goo stuff too I used to do that when
I was running a lot as well that's that
also nukes my stomach I'm sure you
probably seeing like there are a lot of
decent Health trends they probably are
trends like the taping your mouth shut
or the spread out your toes because
modern day shoes compress this like a
big box stuff this feels like one of
those Trends where it's so simple it's
natural you can say hey don't take the
all of those chemicals that are in your
pre-workout it's like the RX bar of
pre-workouts there's salt and there's
honey you see the ingredients right on
the thing there's nothing else in this
thing and maybe who knows if there's
issues with like shelf life of actually
raw good for you honey I don't think
there is but there might be and I think
that just a really easy way it tastes

[04:01]
that just a really easy way it tastes
good like salty honey people don't
really consume that much but it does
taste good and then I think if you want
to you can add caffeine in the future
you can do flavored ones like spicy hot
spicy honey if you into that kind of
stuff that might be bad for working out
but this to me is the I wrote that as my
$1 million doll idea because if I find a
co- packager and I just launch this
thing D Toc I think I can probably get
it there pretty quickly last prodcast we
mentioned element as a brand $200
million topl line $40 million bottom
line like there's room to run tough part
here is like your only exit
opportunities are PNG or other food
brands and that's the way it goes and
there's a lot like selling food can
objectively suck sometimes but selling
supplements on the Internet is usually
pretty good so I'd probably try to stay
more in that supplement world and like
this doesn't have a big shelf space easy
grabbing goes at at the cash register
there's some opportunities there so I'm
glad you mentioned mouth tape because
that's the perfect example of what I'm
talking about and like you go give that
idea to 10 people and they're going to
say dude that's a blog article that's

[05:00]
say dude that's a blog article that's
not a business you write a blog article
about how you tape your mouth and people
are good to go it's like H it's
packaging and it's framing it's literal
packaging and then it's Framing and
packaging the idea it's not even
branding like branding was a cherry on
top right because branding is hard it
takes years packaging Framing and so I
love this idea because that's all it is
right you're just saying don't eat goose
don't have all this processed crap this
is literally salt and honey you can
advertise it by shipping this stuff for
free to races to just put in the packs
for free with your QR code so people can
actually buy them I'm going to add
another idea to this that I've had
forever that's not on my ideas list I
forgot about it but now I'm gonna add it
so have you ever read Born to
Run uh I've seen the book I've never
read it yeah so classic book the whole
thesis is like you should run Barefoot
that's where all those barefoot shoes
came from because they Terra humara in
Mexico they run Barefoot and they can
run hundreds of miles at a time our
bodies were built to run Barefoot Yad
Yad Yad anyway the Tatum the Terra

[06:00]
Yad Yad anyway the Tatum the Terra
humara as a southern idiot would say
like myself they drink something very
specific to run hundreds of miles and
the recipe is in this book and I always
thought like why has no one productized
this why isn't this for sale and I just
asked chat GPT what it is and it's chia
seeds water lime juice and honey it's
like all natural that's all that they
drink to keep going for hundreds of
miles and there are some ultr Runners
that drink that based on the book it's
like why can't you take those four
ingredients get honey and make it like
powdered honey because you don't want to
ship water and just put it in a packet
and it's like an oatmeal packet you just
add water mix it in your water bottle
and you can say I drink the same thing
that they've drank for thousands of
years in Mexico to run hundreds of miles
I love it I think humans will pay an
ungodly amount of money for enhanced
cognition performance specifically
mental and physical Acuity but like I
know you are big on the caffeine as much
as I am but like lately what I've been
finding is that like

[07:00]
finding is that like
after noon or even I don't know I don't
really drink more than one coffee
anymore because I started getting the
habit of drinking like three a day and I
was I'd be around this time right now
and I would just be on the couch I'm
just like I can't do anything anymore
and I'm realizing that the additional
caffeine later on in the day doesn't
work so finding light not heavy
digestive or or things that are not
taking a lot of your energy to digest
and can be quickly consumed that's all I
want to eat all day long I even do some
like the the salt and honey stuff before
this I think the lime juice and chia
seed side is also really cool I'd be
curious how that works as well but I
think like lime def they talk a lot
about either lime or lemon juice in your
water to get the uh water itself more
into the fascia or something like that
of the muscle so there's definitely I
think a lot of opportunity for foods
like that and then I'll have the
whatever triple steak Chipotle bowl at
800m when I don't have to do anything
else triple steak what does that cost in
Manhattan take a guess I I'll I'll

[08:00]
Manhattan take a guess I I'll I'll
actually tell you I'm I'm going to say
I'm going to say do you get
guac no I'm going to say
oh jeez it's pretty crazy because like
the 2175 that's the double St that's
Texas priz yeah yeah right no it's
everything here costs so much money we
went to the US Open last week and all my
relatives were like oh just be careful
like the cocktails there are so
expensive and we got uh a $22 honey
Deuce cocktail or whatever like that and
I was like this is that's every cocktail
that I've ever had in the city like holy
cow it's not cheap have you heard of a
business called construction Journal no
okay you're gonna fall in love it is a
permit database so if you've ever had to
build develop change something like look
outside and look at your physical world
this must be expensive this is g to be
expensive no no way really wow like 179

[09:02]
expensive no no way really wow like 179
a month whoa some of these websites you
look at them you're like that's G be
four grand a month okay okay but I think
they have a lot of customers so here's
my guess on how big this business is
they've got 2011 employees on LinkedIn
as of today with these types of
databased software businesses tell me if
this assumption is wrong and then
that'll probably shape a lot of this I
think they typically try to get an
average of $300,000 in Revenue per
employee um that's the ball that I've
typically heard you have the big guys
like Google and apple they're a million
dollars plus per employee but $250
$300,000 per employee is roughly
accurate that's it's a $60 million a
year business is my guess and what it is
it is a database of any permit in any
zip code that has been pulled to do a
certain type of job and for the average
listener out there hearing this they're
probably thinking who cares or or this
already exists on government websites
sure uh want to know what awful to
navigate government websites want to

[10:02]
navigate government websites want to
know what permits indicate permits
indicate a an intent to spend money to
do something that can oftentimes lead
towards a need to spend even more money
examples of that being I want to get a
permit to remove a ton of trees on a
property if I do that then somebody can
pretty accurately estimate that I'm
going to get a permit or that I'm going
to want to build something or if I get a
permit to say builds leg Bedrock or some
level of foundation and actually start a
development pretty high likelihood that
somebody's going to need a general
contractor they're going to need an
electrician that they're going to need
subcontractors plumbers of sorts
Builders additional day labor whatever
can I give you another example 100% so
in the state of Texas if you want a pool
you got to have a fence around it most
people don't have a fence already you
pull a pool permit they're going to need
a fencer if you want if you have aod
company or hydromulch company you're
going to pull all the permits of people
that just put down a sprinkler system in

[11:01]
that just put down a sprinkler system in
the city of Rockport Texas you have to
pay I think it's $50 per inch of tree
that you cut down and you need a permit
for that and so that's your stump
grinder company can come right on in and
get the list of leads all right so
basically they will tailor it based on
what you need I think that there's a
huge opportunity to say hey we don't get
every armit in the country and we don't
have this incredibly complex and robust
database but if you're an electrician
and we find that there is a high degree
of confidence that when you or let's use
your fencing example you're a fencer and
we know that when somebody's putting in
a pool that this is a super valuable
lead for you a lead that you will pay
$500 for minimum because they're going
to need a $112,000 fence let's do like
pool leads.com and it's literally just a
wrapped version of a very Niche version
of this that is hyper targeted towards
one type of contractor and and you can

[12:00]
one type of contractor and and you can
build this out going back to the
programmatic SEO stuff that we talked
about in a previous episode do this for
the five most expensive most valuable
types of leads whatever that looks like
to you and build up different rappers of
this oh I don't know how I haven't heard
of this like I love I love businesses
where you tell someone the idea and
they're just like that's stupid that's
stupid like people don't start to do
this stuff people don't think to do this
stuff because it's so simple and obvious
but literally your customer is anyone
that doesn't use construction Journal
today which is 99% of business owners MH
all right if you are watching this clip
right now you are watching this on
YouTube and if you are a fan of podcast
please check out my podcast while you're
at it because sometimes I have podcasts
that aren't on YouTube and sometimes I
have YouTubes that aren't on podcast so
check out the Kerner office on any
podcast platform or you can go to TKO
pod.com also my newsletter will throw
that in there there are no ads It's
weekly it's different content than my
podcast and YouTube newsletter. chrisj
cerner.com You'll see the link and we'll

[13:00]
cerner.com You'll see the link and we'll
see you there I also think that like I
just got off the phone before this
podcast with a broker in Florida and he
says that it's funny to being in the
real estate space as I know you are too
like some real estate people who like we
don't have a website which I got off the
phone with somebody last week who
doesn't have a website they're big
developer in the DFW or DFW in Houston
um markets and they're like yeah we
don't do that internet thing and then
you have other people they're like we
use every tool known to man because we
want an edge in any way and he said that
they just paid $10,000 to get a list and
it's like it's not even they don't care
about the individuals they want the
aggregate information of all new vehicle
registration data uh by license plates
within a certain area before any sensus
data comes out because it helps them
make more decisions on like where they
should be targeting developments so if
you register your plate for DFW and
Texas is predicting 20% growth
year-over-year in the DFW Market but
only 5% increase in plate registrations

[14:01]
only 5% increase in plate registrations
have come out before that data comes out
that's interesting to know because then
it says oh they're actually pretty wrong
on the projected population growth maybe
we shouldn't be developing and doing as
many deals here as we were thinking
because we know of that so when you're
doing these tens of millions of Dollar
Deals data becomes incredibly valuable
for you and finding like government data
that is required by law and finding easy
ways to package that and sell it
somebody can just go probably wherever
they're getting this plate registration
information and just get the same type
of data but having it in an easy to
access way and easily filterable
viewable whatever I think is very very
valuable it just reminds me of another
framework where it's like I don't have a
website oh I just spent 10 grand on a
spreadsheet you would think like all
right I'm going to build websites for
real estate agents I'm going to go find
all the people that don't have a website
no they don't want a website you want to
go to the the person that spent 10 grand
on a spreadsheet they probably just
upgraded their website six months ago
they're probably going to upgrade it
again with you because take that really

[15:01]
again with you because take that really
seriously man yeah I'm I'm still stuck
on this construction Journal like I
wonder like what else could you do with
so is it 179 for like unlimited access
or for a certain nich well so I'm not
positive but I do you know that one
thing that they do really well which is
again probably the programmatic SEO
stuff is I I was doing a call with some
development company I'll leave their
name out because I think they they
really enjoy staying private and I
couldn't find anything about them I
couldn't find their website I couldn't
find their LinkedIn I couldn't find
anything so I Googled the name and their
page showed up uh on the first page via
construction journal and you click into
it and it shows you their active
projects their key contacts amount of
funding that they've raised in the past
it'll show things like like the
locations of where they're building
right now you can sign up pretty quickly
and supposedly get like a free preview
of it then if you want more information
beyond that it's pretty expensive so
yeah I think it's a pretty cool business
I try to put around a little bit more of
their website their website's pretty
simple but I do think that I would if
there were more use cases that they

[16:01]
there were more use cases that they
showed on their website because I know
if you go to the bottom of their website
it shows business types General
Contractors manufacturer service
providers subcontractors suppliers and
Distributors that's all really
interesting I bet also something that
they can do that's probably very much so
needed is help you with bidding and
estimating things like I'm sure you've
probably been on that side too where
you're working with contractors and you
get the guy quoting $20,000 for a job
and you got the guys quoting $2,000 for
a job and the ,000 guy like maybe you go
with him but like he could have gotten
an extra $3,000 easily off of something
like this so I think they help with a
decent amount of quotes as well geez
it's bringing it back to an idea we
talked about on our last podcast Pik Fu
right what percentage of people
listening to this right now have heard
of Pik Fu in your mind just guess 5% if
they're entrepreneurs yeah that's my
guess I would say 1 to 5% what
percentage of the people listening to
this are or will run paid ads at some

[17:00]
this are or will run paid ads at some
point probably pretty high I would think
like 20% of they're again going off they
entrepreneurs at least okay let's say
it's 20% and 5% so that means that 75%
of people that will run paid ads have
never heard of piku which Pik fu is like
you said it's basically find a target
market maybe it's business owners maybe
it's soccer moms and you say hey vote on
this logo or vote on this ad tell me
which one resonates with you more like
you could start an agency that does
quote like focus group research on your
paid ads right which one will resonate
more to Facebook moms and you don't have
to tell them exactly what you're doing
for all they know you have like a a
conference room with a focus group you
go to piku and you just copy and paste
their ads and you pay piku $13 and then
you charge whatever you want for really
valuable data I still think this is an
idea that if people want to run with
skill for because this I'm entering an
18-month window of no new ideas and no
new businesses to double down that it's
brutal it's going to be a cold winter
just coming but I'm just entering a

[18:01]
just coming but I'm just entering a
season where like I want to do more than
I have capacity for and everything that
I'm working on right now is working and
if I just keep doing it it'll work more
and work better and grow more so that's
what I need to do right now and it's
frustrating but the idea that eventually
I would like to launch it through my
newsletter I think you could also launch
it just based on all of the content that
you're doing and it would be incredibly
easy to launch and you find a way to
validate it really big market research
reports on these topics and spend the
time going into an idea fully in depth
if I turned to you and I was a little
bit like just wealthier and wanted to
say hey I've got this idea tell me if
it's a stupid idea or not salt salty
honey right like validate this product
for me see if people like it here's
$225,000 Chris like I want a 50-page
report I want you to talk to people I
want something I think that like product
Market validation reports are super cool
and charge a really high fee for the

[19:00]
and charge a really high fee for the
custom ones and then resell that same
information for you build it once you
charge it maybe to $25,000 is a loss
leader or maybe it is a break even or a
slight margin for you and then you say
to the client hey we're able to charge
$25,000 versus $100,000 because six
months after I give you this research
report we put it publicly on our website
and charge people $500 a year to look at
it like I really the other business you
told me about last timeas yeah t yeah
but I really like that from an idea of
research and validation like to me that
is the most fun thing to do and turning
into a business I think it would be
really fun and I do think that there
would be be people that would be willing
to pay depending on the price point and
how you position it but that's the later
game every page of that 50-page report
could be different Pik Fu campaigns 100%
right yeah exactly yep and so it's like
everything from like hey what other
ingredients would you want to see in
this oh what do you think about if we
put guava in it each flavors the right
ones which label and AD you click would

[20:00]
ones which label and AD you click would
you click on you like this packaging or
this one like there's a lot of stuff
there who do you think the customer is
there is it a company launching a new
product is it a entrepreneur I think
unfortunately the the less fun of part
of it is it's probably a company that
wants a new product SL wants to do an
acquisition I also think it's probably
to some degree depend depending on the
scope of it rate we talked about a
$25,000 thing but like is there a
service that you can do pretty reliably
for $2,000 cuz I see myself turning
around saying hey explain to me the
legitimacy of launching an attic
insulation business in tallah hasic
Florida would that work and if there's
somebody who says hey yeah we can do
that and they'll go out they'll get they
say hey we pay a million dollars a year
for all of these different data sources
everything from our unlimited pick
through account to the amount of cars
that drive by Any Given Street on a
given day to satellite on like the boats
that are in a harbor or something like
that we'll do anything that you want and
if they can then put something together
in a more productized way I think that

[21:01]
in a more productized way I think that
will that will probably make it appeal
more to the average entrepreneur but I
remember talking to Xavier helus a while
ago and I was like hey here's like one
thing that you do that goes very
contradictory to every piece of like
classic business advice that I've ever
heard of is you buy businesses in every
category that's something that I enjoy
doing that's why I wanted to have this
conversation but everyone who is smarter
than me tells me don't do that you'll
make more money if you go the
traditional way and he's like well like
his first answer that wasn't really
meant to be like the classic BS one was
just like all right but like look at
Warren Buffett Warren Buffett has
everything from Candy to Insurance to
now Apple stock right like he's not the
best of it so how do you figure that out
well what you do is you talk like when
you're thinking about making these
Investments you talk to the smartest
people in that space and you get every
piece of information that you need to
know about how to do business in that
space and so that's what I do before we
buy any business we bought a pool pool
in ation business over in Arizona like

[22:00]
in ation business over in Arizona like
I'll talk to every person I can possibly
get my hands on what are the single most
important kpis for pool development and
then I'll talk to other people who who
are in Arizona and say what's happening
in the market right now I'll just become
an expert in that space and how can you
do this in a slightly productized maybe
less Consulting way I think that's where
things get pretty interesting that is
interesting yeah for me like I love
doing that stuff myself so I think the
customer here is someone that's like a
white collar worker that wants to start
a business maybe he's buying a franchise
right he's buying a pressure washing
franchise in Tallahassee Florida and he
he's like listen I'm going to put 500
Grand into this so I'm gonna pay five
grand to you to get on the phone and
make sure that I'm not about to make the
biggest mistake of my life I could see
that being a customer because the the
pressure washing franchise or is gonna
be like palas is great where's your
check Wi on the way it's diligence as a
service for sure yeah and then I think
the other customer could be like not a
Proctor and Gamble but like a mid size
company that doesn't have a person for

[23:00]
company that doesn't have a person for
that but still needs to do that research
like we want to launch this new shoe or
this new food or beverage that would be
a fun company to run because doing that
research is so fun and I like using the
grandparent analogy where it's like you
drop off your grandkids with the
grandparents and they spoil them and
then they get to just get rid of them
but this it's like you do all the
research you get paid no matter what you
don't care if it fails or not like
you're off the hook the the other thing
that I think it would be cool
specifically in e-commerce is idea
validation that I know I would pay for I
bet you would too I would think is just
bringing it back to this workout salt
honey thing if I could pay somebody 10
grand and what that 10 grand gets me are
a couple design mockups SL renderings
they make the most basic Shopify landing
page they spin up an ad account and they
make three to five ads and they run a
couple of ads and give me rough ballpark
numbers on what cost per click and add
to cards look like and then when they
add it to card they like hey sorry
what's up you can't check out right now
I would think that's Val that's super
value because I would pay for that too

[24:00]
value because I would pay for that too
yeah yeah so there are Niche versions I
think what you have to do is when you
tell somebody we can do everything
humans aren't that creative and they
they have a tough time saying like all
right well can you do the things I would
actually pay for uh whereas if you can
specifically say like I will call all
your self storage comps for you and get
the updated daily pricing for you I will
run an ad for a product idea that you
have stuff like that I think would be
pretty interesting just on this podcast
and our podcast two episodes ago
we've got a three product company right
now we've got Bizzy juice okay we've got
honey in a packet and then we've got
chia seed mixture from the
Mexicans from the Mexicans the CH Chia
Chia slurp yeah I like it yeah we do we
got a business on our hands cool I've
got one last one for you here we can
probably get through it in capex heavy
capex heavy Yeah it's you're gonna have
and maybe it's not cuz I guess you can
actually lease these spaces but you have
to buy a lot of equipment here I'll give
it to you and I'll this be the worst one
that we've talked about here today but I

[25:00]
that we've talked about here today but I
think there's something and let me do
this let me do this I I'll try to see if
I can find a variation of this idea
that's more capex like that'll be my
task Okay cool so my girlfriend recently
she's full-time attorney here in
Manhattan but she is also a personal
trainer and right now she's a personal
trainer at the gym that both her and I
go to if we like decide not to go to
that gym anymore she's kind of not a
personal trainer anymore like she's got
certified and stuff like that but like
if she wants to sign a client like where
are you taking them in Manhattan like
she can't go to their gym without paying
so the gym gives clients the gym gives
her clients currently yeah that's
correct but on top of that they also
give her the space to train in all of
the equipment whatever I think that
something that would be really cool
would be gyms that are purely dedicated
to having personal trainers with a
membership and I've seen these slowly
starting to pop up and so a couple
interesting things that I think would be
valuable here there is a Chelsea Pierce
which is a New York chain gym that

[26:01]
which is a New York chain gym that
opened up three blocks from me here
60,000 Square ft in Manhattan that is
that is
so that's how big bies is it's a three
four bies with cold plunges and jeez 100
plus treadmills and crazy stuff right
but it's a ton of square footage I think
one of the biggest value ads for this is
you can get away with making gyms with
way less square footage first and
foremost and I think the second thing is
can probably do a lot of really Niche
type of equipment the reality is if you
have a personal trainer you're probably
not just running on the treadmill the
entire time most gyms are plagued with
treadmills and they take up so much
space like you can probably put one or
two in there and that's really just the
warmup no one's paying somebody or
Runners I guess do but like very rarely
do somebody paying somebody to take them
into a gym and train them for an hour on
a treadmill only so you get different
types of equipment you can also do super
high-end levels of equipment which allow
trainers to charge more look like a
superstar give that prestigious feel

[27:00]
superstar give that prestigious feel
keeps client retention High because it's
oh I'm not just quitting my personal
trainer I'm quitting the cryo machine
that they give me at the end of the
workout or I'm quitting the like I know
we use like panata Italian style of
equipment which are like super nice plat
loaded equipment by the gym that we go
to right now and so it's like keeps them
a very sticky product and I guess all in
all I think that you could charge the
personal trainer and you charge them a
combination of a pretty high monthly
retainer I know you're probably going to
GA at my gym price here I think we pay
$250 a month to go to the gym here oh
that's I feel like I'm on the lowend on
compared to some of my friends but we
pay 250 a month I think that you can
probably at least if this gym is based
in Manhattan charge personal trainers
$400 a month plus a very small per their
client fee so that way people aren't
like abusing it and bringing their
friends day and night so call that like
10 15 bucks I don't know what that looks
like but some level of friction so

[28:00]
like but some level of friction so
overall that's my current thought I'll
pause there and get your opinion on like
if there's even a need for this and what
your thoughts are so this idea reminds
me of the idea that I tweeted about a
year ago with the youth training
facilities did you ever see that I don't
know so I've got a 2100 foot shop in my
backyard and I don't really use it for
anything and I'm kind of in a rural area
that's very close to the suburbs like
the DFW suburbs and there is a ton of
demand for one-on-one personal training
for high school and middle schoolers
softball baseball soccer running you
like all of the sports especially like
baseball football and soccer and like
there's nowhere for the trainers to
train the kids right they because the
gyms don't know what to do with them
CrossFit doesn't want them 24-Hour
Fitness doesn't want them no one really
knows what to do with them but in
aggregate it's a really big market and
so I tweeted about this like hey should
I convert my shop into a place for
personal trainers even though it's rural
like everyone is telling me around here
anecdotally like you would be full on

[29:01]
anecdotally like you would be full on
day one there's so much demand and it
got a m a million views and I tweet
about ideas all the time and usually
half people say I'm an idiot half people
say it's a genius this it was like 95%
that's brilliant that works where I live
that works where I live that works where
where I live so it reminds me of that
idea and I love it and I'm wondering if
there's a world where you could go find
maybe it's a Chelsea Piers maybe it's a
a budget gym and you could say Hey you
get 80% of your customers after 5:00 p.m
and before 7 p.m. like transparently can
I like it's basically like a Wei workor
for gyms and for private trainers right
where I'm not going to rent your whole
space but will you give me permission to
come between 10:00 a.m and 4 PM with my
clients I'll pay a premium I'll pay a
premium for each client I have I use all
your equipment and I just use your space
instead of building out a gym you want
to know okay what you just said was the
genius part on how to make this thing
asset light the asset light version of
this it's got to be class passed for

[30:00]
this it's got to be class passed for
personal
trainers and therefore you charge them a
reoccurring thing and you get access to
any gym or the gyms that at least are
signed up because to your point yeah
like you and I are lucky I don't know if
you're the same way but like I never
work out between 7 to 9: am and 5: to 8
PM like I almost right exactly I almost
exclusively honestly usually around now
throughout the day is like is when I
typically will go and then like I'm
walking out of the gym as people are
walking into the gym which is awesome I
never I'm never waiting whatever but
there are a huge amount of people that
I'm sure would take people up on that
and I'd imagine you know the only
downside then becomes okay are the
personal trainers clients willing to go
during the middle of the day maybe but I
think point point is is like can you get
a class pass specifically for personal
trainers that way it's also a good
feeling where like I don't know how the
gyms feel about this but they want to
know like there's some membership
loyalty whatever like the personal
trainer is going to treat your stuff
right and I also think that they are

[31:00]
right and I also think that they are
going to introduce more clientele to
your gym if you're not a class heavy gym
and you want people who weit train in
the area to check it out like it's more
valuable to them so there's definitely
something there I think yeah it's the
same model I interviewed The Swim School
guy on Twitter and he goes to country
clubs and basically places with a pool
already and says hey let me just rent
out your pool to so I can teach these
kids how to swim that way he doesn't
have to spend 500 Grand on a pool
similar model I agree the hard part is
all those people are working out in the
mornings and evenings because that's the
only time they can work out and so
you've got to find trainers that have
customers that can work out in the
middle of the day maybe then there's
like you charge less because it is the
middle of the day this the discount you
get I don't know there's probably an
interesting hook or POS going back to
what we were saying earlier on
positioning like it's probably if the
services get access to your City's best
personal trainers at a fraction of the
price in the top gyms okay what's the

[32:00]
price in the top gyms okay what's the
catch well you got to go at 2 p.m. all
right like I can take a late lunch like
there's probably some opportunity there
to get pretty cool access to that
especially if there's a shower they
could always and if it's nearby could
always go back to work cool I think that
can scale up pretty fast for what it's
worth if you execute it right so that's
my $10 million year business I like that
I like that idea a lot I like that it it
plays on all these current trends it
plays on these infrastructures that
people are already using it plays on the
fact that people are only getting more
vein they're only going to want to keep
going to the
gym that's a winner you just have to
play like it's kind of like a
Marketplace you're the guy that finds
the trainers that already have the
customers if you had to stack rank these
let's do a little refresh here we've got
Grill cleaning workout honey P how do
you want to call yours podcast
distribution agency podcast agency yeah
testing agency whatever database of
Niche construction permits personal
training gems and chia juice if you

[33:00]
training gems and chia juice if you
workout honey Chia juice where what are
you saying is the clear winner that if
you dropped everything you'd go after
today I'm always biased for more
accessible ideas same same so I'm gonna
start with the first one Grill cleaning
that's my number one yep number two is
going to be the honey Chia juice we'll
throw busy juice in there too yep number
three oh man though oh but you know what
screw that I'm going to say number one
the Le gen that's incredibly accessible
construction permits yes like incredibly
high margin incredibly that's number one
number two Grill cleaning number three
the drinks and the Honey number four
podcast Agency number five is the gym
the only one left the gym one the gym
yeah if you want to do that the idea of
validation one but I think that was toss
up yeah I put the gym
one I put idea validation last because I
think it's going to be hard to find your
core customer
and the gym one second to last because I

[34:01]
and the gym one second to last because I
don't go to the gym I run and I cycle
and weights are too heavy I I think I'm
almost the same exact ranking there yeah
I like what do you got almost the same
where what would you switch around I
think I hate selling to people that
don't have money
and the podcast one breaks that for me I
love the product concept I just I
wouldn't buy it and unfortunately I love
the product and I wouldn't pay for it
what does that tell me yeah and you're a
guy that like you're trying to grow you
like you could afford it right it might
not have a positive Roi today but you
could afford it and you're trying to
grow your podcast but even then it's not
worth it I am the Target customer and
I'm being cheap about it which sucks
yeah otherwise everything else like for
the most part you're selling to people I
think something that would be pretty
interesting and I know you got to jump
here in a sec something that would be
pretty interesting that I wanted to make
a segment on today but I thought of it
10 minutes before we pressed record and
if we want to do another episode I think
it would be fun I realized the other day
that most of the companies that I own

[35:01]
that most of the companies that I own
currently are pretty focused on like
good times like econom economies rolling
and everything is good yeah like the
boat storage units yep storage units
maybe a little bit lesser but like when
people have stuff storage units there a
bull case for each right like yeah
people downsize when things aren't good
they buy more stuff when things are good
even like the recruiting stuff like
people stop hiring people stop paying me
so like there's a lot of stuff where if
the economy takes it downturn I want to
hedge and so going into this next 18
months and we're not starting new
companies But after those 18 months come
time 2026 baby we are uh going to build
a recession resistance business that is
not a vice business it is not a pure
funeral business and I want to find
something that people still buy when
times are tough so if you want to
brainstorm on that we can record again
any
time that that that seems like it's
going to be the next episode do you have
some thoughts in mind yeah I I I was
scouring redddit before this and I have

[36:01]
scouring redddit before this and I have
three thoughts right now but I want to
do more research on them let's make that
the next one then where can everyone
find you
cgro on every social media or bisb brain
stor.com

this is part two of our two-part episode
go back a week to listen to the first
one and this is Connor gross thank you
