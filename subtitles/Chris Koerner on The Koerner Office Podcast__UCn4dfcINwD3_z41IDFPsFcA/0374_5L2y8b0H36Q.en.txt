look at this freaking guy right here he
makes Custom Homes out of miniature
materials just for funsies that this
could be an amazing business girls have
doll houses but what do guys have and
I'm not talking about kids or teenagers
I'm talking about grown men like myself
I showed this to my wife and I was like
this is amazing I would totally do this
men are Builders I promise you they
would pay for stuff like this and as far
as I know no one's selling this stuff at
least not in a good way if I were to
Source all these materials and sell them
like crazy this is exactly how I would
do it
