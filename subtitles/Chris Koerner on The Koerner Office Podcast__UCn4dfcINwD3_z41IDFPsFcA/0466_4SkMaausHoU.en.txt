look at this freaking guy right here why
aren't you starting this business yet
here's how you should start it and what
it is did you know that thousands of
these are sold every year to
entrepreneurs all over the world but
husky will do 80% of the work for you
and these are much higher quality than
normally what you can get on the market
he converted one of those standard Home
Depot Husky workbenches into a coffee
cart so if I were you I would take one
of these husky carts this is day nine of
showing you my favorite 2025 business
idea so follow for more turn it into a
coffee cart or a Sherie cart or a hot
dog cart or anything and post it on
Facebook Marketplace and boost some paid
ads to it but before you even build it
post it to Facebook Marketplace pictures
of someone else's so you can see how
much interest you get before investing a
dollar into it I bet you can make $500
to $1,500 on each of these sell a couple
of month and that's a good living full
business plan right here
