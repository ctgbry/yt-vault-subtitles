[00:00]
I just think it's Genius of him he
listened to your hack that you've used
and he applied it in a way that you
hadn't used it he's productizing it and
selling it to business owners Boomer
business owners that don't know how to
do it anyways and charging them 750
bucks a month I think it's freaking
[Music]
genius welcome to the ker office today
Nick and I chatted all kinds of cool
business ideas that I think you'll love
so I'm going to start calling this type
of episode The Hold Co Bros and I think
you'll enjoy it I'm kind of mad because
I had another episode plann to come out
today another Q&A with business owners
as I'm known for doing but the audio was
all messed up so I had to put in this
episode of Nick and I also I changed the
numbering of these episodes so if it
looks like I released a whole bunch of
episodes overnight I didn't I just
changed how they're numbered so it's a
lot more clean now anyway enjoy have you
ever heard me talk about on Twitter or
wherever how it's very advantageous for
people to go into local Facebook groups
and talk about hey I'm a young guy or
hey I just started a business i' love

[01:00]
hey I just started a business i' love
your support and generating leads that
way you've seen that bit Yeah so I
talked about that a lot when we launched
fast tree here and that's how we got our
first jobs James went into these local
Facebook groups and said I'm James I
just graduated from college and you're
basically playing on everyone's pity
Gene right like they want to support you
they like supporting entrepreneurship
and it works and so I met this guy
recently I don't think it's a Pity genan
I don't think it's a Pity Gene but I
think it's I want to help out generation
yeah yeah sure sure so I met this guy
named Danny and he productized this
based on my idea and he's charging 750
bucks a month to business owners to log
in to local Facebook groups on the
business owner's Facebook account so
they'll share their login info and he
goes in there and basically gives that
pitch systemizes it sends everyone to a
Google form and generates leads for the
business owner for 750 bucks a month
what are your thoughts shut

[02:00]
what are your thoughts shut
up are you serious he got this idea from
you serious yeah what royalty are you
getting you know that kid that emailed
us about his billion dooll Landscaping
idea that's him that's him that's him
yeah no way so he wants to use this
model to scale a landscaping business
Nationwide with like college students
and I think there's a lot of Merit to
this there's a business around the
corner from me called we all know about
college hunks hauling junk there's one
ah there's one around the corner they
have wrapped purple trucks and it's
called oh jeez about pay my student
loans let me see no that's an only fans
I
think I don't know what you're talking
about college fund landscaping.com
college fund Landscaping so okay these
guys have a bunch of acreage on a busy
road with a ton of rap trucks out front
which tells me they're doing really well

[03:00]
which tells me they're doing really well
and I think that they productized that
little hack of playing on people's
supportive gene or pity gene or whatever
you want to call
it I so here's why I want to talk about
the idea in particular in a second but
first I want to say this is why I love
Facebook I know a lot of people younger
than us in particular are not big on
Facebook but who is really big on
Facebook people our Ag and older in
particular Boomers and when you look at
their you know that demographic traffic
they have money to spend they are more
likely to spend their disposable income
so you are going to a group of people
where they're gathered that have actual
money to spend and when you go to these
Facebook groups with these owners some
it's like shooting fish in a barrel
because they they just have no idea
about technology they have no idea how
to optimize things and how many
businesses have you done like you bought
a Facebook group with one of your
companies that I won't mention that you
you know that you ended up turning into
a funnel for business just by buying the

[04:01]
a funnel for business just by buying the
Facebook group and then funneling them
to your business right so I think
there's a ton of opportunity with these
Facebook groups this the second thing in
particular I just think it's Genius of
him he listened to your hack that you've
used and he applied it in a way that you
hadn't used it he's productizing it and
selling it to business owners Boomer
business owners that don't know how to
do it anyways and charging them 750
bucks a month I think it's freaking
genius I know I think it's funny seeing
people pick up with stuff that I talk
about and it's I see them launch it and
they're successful and it's just man if
I had more time that would be me I might
not be doing it as well as you because
this kid's crushing it but I could
totally do that so just yesterday I was
looking at a business called what was it
after.com I think it's after.com where
it's these guys at a Provo they raised a
bunch of money to brother productize
cremations human cremations and so they
partnered with cremation facilities
around the country and they have just
like three products on their website
900,00 00 and what was interesting was I

[05:03]
900,00 00 and what was interesting was I
went into similar web and did some
digging on where they're getting their
traffic from and it's all from Facebook
because 60 70 80 year olds on fa are on
Facebook so where else would it come
from what are they doing out a Provo
like they have a cremation company that
they're providing The Cremation Services
for or they're helping they just white
labeling human Cremation Services okay y
Shez Louise talk about
anyway my point was they're getting all
of their traffic from Facebook because
that's the demographic right if you want
to talk about it what do you think of
Danny is his
name how he's pitched us launching this
college Landscaping Company using this
method because he so for those who don't
know Danny just reached out to us cold
sent us an email I responded back to him
and said hey seems like a a cool
business idea why don't you actually put
together a deck and sent us a proposal

[06:01]
together a deck and sent us a proposal
so he put some time into it and actually
sent over a deck with the proposal and
anybody who's on Twitter he wrote a good
hook it was like billion dooll idea sent
it to us and Chris and I have looked at
it but we actually haven't had a chance
yet to actually debrief on it and if you
don't want to talk about it now we can
talk about it you know offline but what
do you think of his idea and what do you
think of like actually partnering with
him to launch something like
this I think there's just like universal
law in business where it's like more
heada more Logistics more potential
scale more potential profit and I'm like
I'm this old Boomer 37y old that's like
less headache less profit I don't care I
just want I'd rather do 12 things with
less headache than two things with much
headache and so I I want to partner with
him on this lead generation thing and
just find a bunch of people to generate
leads for through their local Facebook
groups right forget about the
Landscaping idea because that there are
just so many operational things that you
have to manage in order to execute that
well he's talking about using stud all

[07:00]
well he's talking about using stud all
differents ESS it's a franch right
whereas with this you don't have to
franch it you can be Central you can
find these businesses and you can scale
it fairly well I shouldn't say fairly
easy much easier than you could having
to go through college students I agree
with you on that I I love the idea of
utilizing the college students and he
reached out to us because we have over
35,000 applicants to our co-founders
program and he's hey we could use the
co-founders network in order to Launch
this but yeah I think it would be more
profitable and less operational headache
to launch something that's helping these
essentially Boomer Facebook groups
maximize Facebook yeah we're talking
about Landscaping already so let's just
go down the line and I want to talk
about that guy on YouTube who has a
Channel with millions of subscribers
that just mows people's Lawns for free
and he films it and then he posts the
videos and his whole pitch is hey let me
Mo you la for free why would you do that
well because people watch it on YouTube
okay weirdo sure I feel like this could

[08:00]
okay weirdo sure I feel like this could
be you could do this with any industry
right you could and there probably are
people doing it in other industries that
I just haven't researched yet but you've
got negative CAC for those that don't
know what negative CAC is negative
customer cost which you take okay you
take someone like Kevin Espiritu who has
the Epic gardening Channel and YouTube
pays him to sell raised Planters on his
YouTube channel so this customer
acquisition cost is less than zero
because he's getting paid to Market to
his customer
I feel like this is like a different
version of negative CAC and I almost
look at my show the same way where it's
like hey I want to consult for your
business well how much well it's free
well why would you do it for free
because people are going to listen to it
on the internet right like that model I
think is in its early early early days
and you could apply it to almost
anything especially to things that are
like ASMR or things that are relaxing to
watch like even like an assembly line
video or the How It's Made show right
like just

[09:00]
like just
monetizing taking videos of cool things
like do you remember that episode I had
episode two or three the Tesla wheel
repair and then Tesla car washing I know
it's an episode but I never listened to
it yeah I know I know which episode
you're talking about though yeah so this
guy basically said why aren't there
people washing Teslas at every
supercharger and it's like why aren't
there you just sit there for 30 40
minutes and the haters aka the rational
people the what about insurance people
they would say well you can't actually
electricity plus water yeah those people
they would say that you know you can't
charge a car while you wash it but you
can put Rovers on Mars we can figure out
how to do that it's like a plastic bag
or something right yeah if they can give
my grandma a bath in a Skilled Nursing
Facility without taking her out of the
bed we can figure out how to wash a
Tesla without frying it circuit hey and
I just want to say we can get there I
just want say I'm going to go tell this

[10:00]
just want say I'm going to go tell this
to my wife tonight actually so it's
actually the smaller the CAC the better
right is that not oh my gosh I'm sorry
I'm just going to power through that
we're we're going to call this our power
through it
segment we have a power through it
segment every 5 Seconds which actually 5
seconds is a really long time but I
think what's interesting about what
you're talking about is he wouldn't have
had the negative CAC unless he had the
distribution so so I can't remember his
name a spe two on YouTube or the guy who
Ms Lawns Kevin Kevin or the guy who Ms
Lawns nobody's going to care to watch
their lawn mowing video at first they've
got to build up an audience and then
when they go mow the lawn for free
they're able to essentially monetize off
of it let's brainstorm what are some
other Industries you could do this
for I know you've got like one on the
tip of your
tongue honestly I didn't do a lot of
research on this topic well it's it just
kind of I'll jump I'll jump in because

[11:00]
kind of I'll jump I'll jump in because
that's fine it's similar to power
washing for sure power washing for sure
oh gosh yeah it's got to be it's got to
be a visual like there's got to be a
visual component to it right because
that that just captures eyeballs where
oh man this is the before and after so
power washing falls into that mowing
falls into that probably tree trimming
would fall into that oh gutter cleaning
right just like the ACT good unclogging
all those gutter or the visual of the
water like coming out the down spout oh
dude that would be and every like it's
something that anyone could use it has
to be a service that any homeowner could
use at any given time so like Roofing
doesn't work right have you ever watched
those YouTube videos it's called
primitive
Builders it's these guys yeah yeah so
it's these guys in like Thailand who go
in the middle of if you're a red blooded
American male youve stayed up late
watching those videos okay D like my my
kids have love those videos but the cool

[12:01]
kids have love those videos but the cool
thing about it is you just see them
build over time and there's no talking
cuz none of them speak English you could
have a a YouTube channel that's cleaning
gutters with no talking where it's like
the mix of ASMR and uh and the video
where it's you know the washing and then
the unclogging and then whatever the
guy's swearing when he smashes his
finger but okay I like the gutter
cleaning you know what else would be a
good one and they've actually done these
before like the before and afters of
guys who have disheveled beards or like
bad hair and you're a hair stylist and
you go cut hair so one of the commenters
on YouTube right now aie he said salons
so that's yeah exactly what's up aie you
guys are sinking up you guys are sinking
up he gets me he gets me I like this
obviously Home Services makes a lot of
sense
yep cool let's talk about AI generated
podcast for a second so tell us Nick
what you learned what you learned today
all right background is there Chris and

[13:00]
all right background is there Chris and
I both launched podcasts in the last few
months to be specific Chris launched his
podcast on February 22nd I launched my P
podcast on April 28th gosh can I talk
today oh I like
myp I launched my podcast on April
28th before Chris launched his podcast
we had an experiment back in started in
August of last year with Brandon who's
on Braden sorry Braden who's on Twitter
as well where we said could we create a
AI generated podcast and it was pretty
simple we cloned Chris's voice and then
we went and found stories and I'm using
we liberally here it was Chris we went
and found stories online that had lots
of views and that were popular that
Chris had compiled in a library from all
these different places that he had read
them and fed the text through a filter
and then used the cloned AI voice of
Chris combined those two and we created
these 5minute segments called startup

[14:00]
these 5minute segments called startup
gems they were just quick stories and we
released those every single day for
about 4 months H and it was cool we had
some traction we were getting I don't
know 10 20 30 downloads a day Chris
probably in that range and yep yep and
when Chris and I decided to do podcasts
we had the conversation he's hey do do
you care if I transition startup gems to
now be the ker office and I didn't care
I was like it was your voice and most of
your stories at that point we were
getting like two downloads a day too it
we purposely didn't want to push it we
wanted to see could we just keep
uploading and could it grow on its own
and it could not and so there was this
Content Library of I think 90 I think
there's about 90 88 I think maybe
there's anyways 90 episodes that were
there and then Chris launches his
podcast on February 22nd well I track
our downloads every single day and I
like to look at what percentage of the
people downloading are listening to old
episodes because to me that says people
are binging on old things so I pulled up
Chris's metrics today and I was like why
is it so freaking High people are

[15:01]
is it so freaking High people are
listening to a lot of his old episodes
and yesterday about 10% of the downloads
for Chris's podcast went back and were
listening to these AI generated podcasts
that we had created and they're the
perfect kind of fit for his audience
right they're five minutes they're
business stories they're engaging it's
his voice and they're just really quick
to get in and out of and it was just an
aha lightl moment for both of us not
even an aha I should say a validating
moment for for both of us because we
believed in content we believe that
building a library of content is
valuable and it was the validation of
that thesis by looking and seeing Oh man
130 people listened to this old podcast
that we' forgotten about just yesterday
just because we're continuing to put out
content yeah so I think that AI
generated podcast should be more of a
thing but it should be done in a
different way where the business owner
or the podcast owner discloses up front
like this is a ad generated which is why
you're getting so much of it it's more
of a quantity game and I think you could

[16:01]
of a quantity game and I think you could
do it really interestingly with things
like let's take Seinfield fans right you
could get AI to review every episode or
to summarize every episode or something
and it's just programmatic it's
automatic every single day a podcast is
uploaded and it's very asymmetric
because your cost is $18 a month that's
what you pay to host the podcast and
your time is it's a zero time once you
get it set up you could have zapier Auto
uploaded every single day and you're not
trying to trick people you're telling
people it's AI generated but you're
basically feeding them content that when
they get to the office they're seeking
out anyway so maybe it's just a summary
of yesterday's news maybe it's hyper
Niche like a summary of you know home
health and hospice news the day before
dude I I just had this idea you should
take all of the the startup gems podcast
episodes or I will if you don't want to
do this and upload them to your
YouTube and put on a playlist like

[17:01]
YouTube and put on a playlist like
people would binge on those they would
totally binge on those and it's sticky
and it keeps people there and it doesn't
necessarily confuse your episodes you
know what I mean necessarily but I I
think that would be a genius idea
because what you're trying to do is
you're trying to get people to trust you
you're trying to build trust at scale
and what builds trust is you have to get
to know somebody and that's why podcasts
and news newsletters and Twitter and
YouTube are so valuable because it gives
you a platform for people to get to know
you very intimately so anyways I I think
that would be a genius
idea another thing you can do on YouTube
I don't know if you knew this but when
you upload a podcast or when you upload
a video you can elect for it not to show
to your subscribers so if you just want
to ke test something and just see if the
algorithm picks it up but you don't want
to spam your subscribers you just check
a box and you upload it so what about a
service that takes the tweets from the
people that you have notifications on
for and this could be any social media
platform in Instagram Twitter Facebook

[18:00]
platform in Instagram Twitter Facebook
whatever and then every morning it's
autogenerated to say here's the recap
from yesterday right here here were the
most popular tweets here's what's going
on with Twitter cuz how do you find out
what's going on right now is you just
scroll and it it takes time for you to
get caught up on what's going on and
it's not proactive right like you have
to go out and seek it out but that would
be cool to just give people a daily hey
here's what's going on hey here's the
update on your industry hey here's
what's going on in this community that
you're working on right it could be I'm
on this WhatsApp group with these other
Healthcare entrepreneurs and I missed
two days worth of the conversation and
in those two days they had a ton where
they just went through and I was like
I'm not going to go back and read this
you know what I mean I could do it on my
family texts too I'm like my
mother-in-law is texting me about the
baby photo that she took 35 years ago
I'm like I'm not going to I'm just not
going to look at it I don't I'm not
going to read this stuff so I just check
out but it'd be nice to be like hey can
you just AI can you auto summary the
last 50 t text and just tell me what I

[19:00]
last 50 t text and just tell me what I
missed that would be so helpful for me
instead of just ghosting
people back to the Twitter idea you
could even have zapier say hey I only
want to see I want you to read me tweets
from people that I follow that had over
50,000 Impressions just read me those
let me filter through all the crap that
no one else thought was interesting
either then you could block on your
phone right that's super interesting
because then you're combining the
clubhouse house air chat phenomenon
where people like we like to listen to
audio with Twitter right or it's just
read me the tweets you could even record
your own voice you could have it
recorded in somebody else's voices and
it was like you know it'll be like that
would be funny to read those tweets
though could you imagine hey Siri read
me the tweets from yesterday sure thing
here's a text from Nick tweet from Nick
Huber if you have blue hair I will not
hire
you any man on Instagram is a red

[20:01]
you any man on Instagram is a red
[Laughter]
flag I hired over deck I installed for
my tenant tenants I added $400 to the
monthly rent by adding a deck it doesn't
even look dangerous wouldn't you agree I
read 17 hours worth of Nick Huber's book
so you wouldn't have to here's what I
learned about self
motivation a thread oh no he so this is
the fremium service that we offer but
then the premium service for $4.99 a
month is what we call the Huber filter
where just filters all that
out well he probably just needs it for
himself because he's I own a real
business now I can't be just you know
crap tweeting at
everybody that that would be funny he
like gets on his phone he's about to
tweet something Nick don't tweet that
take me to the island I want to go to
the island with you

[21:00]
the island with you
all right sorry oh we're going off the
rails I really like that idea though I I
really like that idea about I agree
somehow utilizing AI
to either put out organize
summarize content information that is
that currently is not in an aggregated
place for you to go look at do you
remember the Robin Hood snacks podcast I
used to listen to I had those two guys
mhm
it was a daily podcast it was like 5 to
15 minutes and they did not skip a day
for two three years and it was live it
was real it was basically financial news
from the day before and they would
record it like at 4 in the morning every
single day like even the day after they
got married everything I feel like you
could do something very similar but
automated like a daily summary of X Y or
Z Niche news and it just it's all
automated it updates automatically it
generates the info automatically and
dude you saw I think Thomas Newell

[22:01]
dude you saw I think Thomas Newell
created a custom chat GPT bot for
co-founders for you and I like he took
our episodes and he fed them through an
L or what like whatever it
is you could do the same thing you could
train AI on you and I like upload all of
our
episodes and then have a separate thing
go and scrape news and it's here's the
five minute you know co-founders news
for the day and then marry those two
things with our personality our voices
and have the data being scraped every
day we should stop talking about this
and take this offline this a billion
dollar
idea maret clear my calendar we have
ones of people listening right now so
they're probably stealing it right now
oh my gosh it's
incredible one thing that I've been
thinking about this week in particular
and it goes along with this AI piece is
you know who chamath is from the alline
podcast right yes he's launched this
he's launched this fund called I think
it's
8010 uh and the idea behind the fund is

[23:03]
8010 uh and the idea behind the fund is
we're going to use Ai and we're going to
essentially copy any of the major tools
out there we're going to get you 80% of
the fun functionality for 10% of the
cost so oh you use Salesforce but
they're really expensive no with AI now
I can use whatever a developer team get
you 80% of the functionality for 10% of
the cost and so like his whole bet is
software is going to become a lot more
more tailored to individuals as opposed
to it just being this big Enterprise
platform that you pay hundreds of
thousands of dollars to then tailor to
your specific
company so I'm really interested in this
idea right now and one of the areas that
I think that it applies is in Staffing
and I know that you feel this way
but being on Twitter it's like oh man
the Global Talent Market is saturated
with people who are finding talent and
then placing them here in the United
States there's so many companies that
are doing it but when you zoom out
there's not really that many companies

[24:00]
there's not really that many companies
doing it it's growing like crazy it's a
space that people are investing in and
that is only getting more and more
saturated but it it is by no means
saturated I think that people can stake
out their Claim by niching down in that
space so what I mean by that is right
now you know you and I have talked about
this could we launch one of these
businesses with our distribution yeah
but then we'd have to you know we'd have
to go out we'd have to actually find a
team in the Phil phes we'd have to or
whatever country we're sourcing them
from we'd have to manage them we'd have
to get a pipeline we'd have to have a
sales team like it's a whole
infrastructure build out that you'd have
to
get but what if we didn't do any of that
and we just niched down and said hey we
want to provide Global Talent
specifically
for leads that's it that's the only
thing that we do is we do lead
generation or lead generation okay
exactly right or I want to do outsourced

[25:01]
exactly right or I want to do outsourced
Talent specifically for video editing
and content creation that's what sahil
Bloom's new company is or we do Global
Talent specifically for home
services and in that model I think
somebody like us could launch it and
then white label it with an existing
international company so we're like
we're filling the niche need of people
who want a specific type of employee but
then we also don't have to build out the
infrastructure on the back end I
actually think that's what sahill is
doing I could be totally wrong but when
sahill posted about hey I'm launching
this company Nick Huber like very next
line is man you're going to crush it I'm
really excited for you there's space for
everybody in this market Nick doesn't do
that crap Nick is like very he gets butt
hurt very easily he's very competitive
he doesn't like people being in his
space white labeling it I think there's
I think there's something potentially
there where he's white labeling it with
sahill and so sahill is generating all
of the stuff but then it's just
funneling for back back office
fulfillment to to support shephard I

[26:01]
fulfillment to to support shephard I
don't know how I didn't notice that
because I saw his comment and I thought
that's weird well they're friends so
whatever but think think about their
revenue models they're totally different
Shephard charges like it's it ends up
being three to five grand one time and
Sills is charging three to five grand
every month and so if Shephard says hey
we'll give you we'll give you 40% off so
it's going to be 2,200 bucks per
placement you're going to make that back
in month one and then company doesn't
have to do any work whatsoever and
Huber's thrilled because it's just more
volume and their margins are 80% so
little less margin on those but it's
just a bonus well in like a little
inside baseball here we have a friend
who knows people in that space knows the
Huber
Sanchez space and he posted something
one of those influencers liked it and
reposted it and then they took it down
because Huber reached out to them and
was like like hey could you take this
down it's competing with one of my he

[27:00]
down it's competing with one of my he
felt like it was competing with one of
his businesses right so if he's that
petty about something small I can't see
him being like cool about sahill
launching something so in my mind
friends are not agreed friend friends
were not it's funny because the
Shepherds of the world got their start
by unbundling upwork right you upwork
leads the pack you unbundle up work by
doing it more in a more Niche different
way and now people are unb shepher
because that's all landed is doing
they're just so it's just the unbundling
never stops right right and it makes
sense because the more Niche you can get
the faster you can grow and then you
know eventually when you're so
Niche I I talk about this a lot where in
software there's this concept of land
and expand you get into a service
offering and then you start offering
adjacent Services right and it's the
same in business you start an agency
doing I don't know payperclick and then

[28:01]
doing I don't know payperclick and then
you start buying other companies that
are now doing SEO and other companies
that are doing Google my business and
other companies that are doing lead
generation like they're all adjacent to
what you're offering but you're using
that Central piece cash flows to start
buying other businesses that can that
you can gobble up and piece together I I
think it's the same thing like they're
doing the unbundling to start and then
they grow into being able to offer a
bunch of different
Services yeah because I think the secret
sauce with Shephard is the fact that
they don't have to just go post upw work
every time they need someone they have
their own internal database now and so
landed is skipping the line by
leveraging their existing database they
don't have to worry all right this
person that Shepherd's handing over are
they going to be any good they're pretty
sure that person's already been vetted
and maybe working for them on other
projects for the last two to three years
they're good so the quality they have
quality from day one so I know the
answer to this question but for people
who aren't who don't know and that are
listening what is landed I know it I
know what it is I know what land it is I

[29:02]
know what it is I know what land it is I
just for them will you explain to them
what land it
is that's the hills company that we've
been talking about gosh dang can you
Mohammad edit that you've been talking
about it too I'm so stupid I don't you
know me I like read three words in a
post and I'm like okay cool I got the
gist and I move on it no it's called
autism and I know it's all good
it's all good I'm an arst what do you
want me to
say what speaking of that I have a
retraction I need to make I got to make
a
retraction you ready for this okay yeah

talked about our pet cremation business

friend at Hare advisor guy who lives
near me was in my house this morning
when we bought the van this sounds like
really serious but I'm actually just

[30:00]
really serious but I'm actually just
trolling Stephen right now so I'll bury
the leap I'm not going to BU the leap I
bought the van with a loan remember we
talked about the loan and then the
lender said this is there was some weird
Quirk on the title and and they were
like you can't buy this as a business
you have to buy this as an individual so
then Stephen stepped up and he said I'll
buy it and so then he listened to our
podcast and he's oh you didn't tell
everyone that I bought it you sold them
that you so let me be very clear Stephen
hail bought the van cash because he is a
rich and attractive man and I was wrong
in our last podcast and I genuinely
apologized to him oh my gosh I'd be
freaking so butt hurt I'm I'm actually
like butt hurt for him because I'm like

yesterday I went to the bathroom at the
office one and I went to go to the
bathroom that's not fair and it had not
been flushed okay I don't want to be too
graphic but someone went number two in
the bathroom okay and I was just like
but I didn't have a choice it was my
only toilet okay so I was just like this
is disgusting and then I thought about
how silly that is how if you take the
average person you put two toilets side
by side you're going to elect to poop in
the one that doesn't have poop in it
already right of course and it's like
the one that has poop in it it's like
the mindset is ah somebody pooped in
this oh it's
disgusting as if the one that doesn't
have poop in it has never been pooped in
what what do we think how do we feel
about that it's a two it's a two I think
you could refine it a little bit yeah
it's a two it's a two I don't even like
that one I don't even like that one okay
all
right insecurities on full display it
was stupid scratch that all right you're
going to like this one I'm going to okay

to overhype something cuz I'm that
confident in this one so our good friend
