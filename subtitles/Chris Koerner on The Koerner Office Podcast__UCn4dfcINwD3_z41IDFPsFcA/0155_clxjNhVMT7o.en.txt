all right this is crazy but I just spoke
to a guy that posted a poll to his
neighborhood next door a group that said
how much would you pay to have your lawn
leveled and he got 150 responses there
was so much demand he quit his job and
started a lawn leveling business he
charges
$2,300 to level a 4,000 ft tiny lawn I
just spent an hour picking his brain
