[00:00]
you guys got to stop swinging at these
multi-billion doll business ideas I just
promise if you put 6 months into
something you can make 200k a year and
Be Your Own Boss why would I not make
that swing do I think I'm going to build
a career off the back of a AI powered
cooking app no do I think I can go make
100 200k off of it sure AI is cool but
the Facebook ads manager that's my
favorite thing to come out of the
century figure out how to click the
buttons correctly you can print cash it
is so easy to test these things so fast
go test it and the market will tell you
what's
[Music]
good I do got to build my sourdo app you
do need to do it I'm mine's coming
together we're waiting for Apple
approval or whatever and so I'll let you
know how it goes I'm gonna be the first
person to download it yeah dude 60 bucks
a year I appreciate it I'll immediately
go flip it and get my money back not
just playing I mean I mean I'll be the
first person downloading it assuming
that I get a bro to Bro 100% discount oh
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah dude we'll give
you a 50% discount I'm doubling the

[01:00]
you a 50% discount I'm doubling the
price and I'll give you a 50% discount
first month special that you're going
you're going like Black Friday special
yeah yeah dude in the in the middle of
March happy St Patrick's Day
dude dude I literally had AI write that
entire I had to get a stripe account for
it and to get a stripe account you have
to have a website and so I literally
just had AI do the whole thing I was
like yeah I need 15 feature bullet
points please and I just copy and pasted
it all in dude what is your website
instant
chef. it's ready to launch you're just
waiting no I yeah it's like the buttons
and stuff don't go to the actual app
store or anything um and then I need to
make product screenshots yeah it's
basically good we're doing the last
payment Integrations right now and then
have to get it in the App Store how do
you make websites this good how long did
it take you to make this I don't know
I'm pretty sure I just bought a template
and then I just need to go and make the
the mockups the mockups of the app in
there oh so clean you're so good at
websites thanks dude I really apprciate

[02:00]
websites thanks dude I really apprciate
that shout out 72 hour sites.com yeah
seriously and the crazy part the crazy
part Chris is that it's only 2500 bucks
it's not like a $112,000
website I promise your conversion thank
you I know card guy I know and it's
upsetting to say the least invest in
your brand I'll buy the Bullet by the
end of the year yeah I was going to say
right when you're about you're trying to
get the tax write off in December that's
right that's right our busiest month
ever dude everyone's like can we oh
everyone buys a website in December
because they like wait I'm going have to
pay taxes on this money so I might as
well buy a website yeah we had like
seven people buy websites in between
Christmas and New Year's and they were
like we don't have to launch it for a
while like we we just want to pay for it
now we're like say less dude I'm in
perfect really messed up my band with uh
in January early Feb though because like

[03:00]
in January early Feb though because like
I bet it did our Revenue to it was it
was whatever it's fine money is money
yeah when you zoom out it doesn't really
matter so instant Chef's going live
you're G to start pushing paid ads to it
is that like plan a b c and d that's
literally the only plan is we're going
to run ads we're going to test running
ads directly to that Lander to see what
happens and then we're going to test
direct to App Store also and so if I run
both those we'll just kind of see how
the math plays depending on what's good
I might go try like buy a couple Niche
like theme pages in the cooking space
I'll probably start a few we talked
about on the last episode of like just
grab viral content repurpose publish it
a bunch and so I think that'll be
another another plan I dude I figured
out how to do it even more
programmatically now using Banner bear
super clutch Banner bear is like
programmatic image creation and so
basically like find the viral videos and

[04:00]
basically like find the viral videos and
and all I do so zappier has a uh a
Google Chrome like extension and so I go
in and I just search whatever term I
want vegan recipes and then I'm
scrolling on Instagram on my desktop and
then every video that I want I just
click add on zapier or add to
spreadsheet you're adding someone else's
Instagram video to the spreadsheet with
the zapier yeah yeah just a new row link
to that I take that all of that CSV and
I put it into appify they have an
Instagram post yeah love it Ed it for n
million different purposes they download
all of that you take that CSV you sauce
it into air table which triggers a zap
which then sends the video into Banner
bear this video is kind of like a
time-lapse of someone cooking a vegan
recipe in this case yeah any any viral
vegan cooking recipe someone else's
video yeah so puts that into the

[05:00]
video yeah so puts that into the
template and automatically changes the
day because I do the one that I was
seeing work on send prayers was day one
of finding good Christian music day 1.5
right and so it does that piece of it
automatically and then it just pumps
them all into Dropbox for me when it's
done and then I just bulk upload from
Dropbox directly onto Hopper HQ and it
just schedules them all out so easy and
so I'm like I just spend now I used to
have to like do and can but bolt create
and like all this stuff now all I do is
I just scroll on that account for like
10 minutes grab 60 videos and I'm not
really even watching them I'm just like
if they're showing up at the top of
hasht vegan recipe I'm just kind of like
trusting it and you're scrolling on like
Instagram desktop yeah in the browser
okay yeah in browser hit the zap button
send a sheet send a sheet send a sheet
get 60 of them upload the CSV let it
ride the whole thing takes me like

[06:00]
ride the whole thing takes me like
I don't know maybe 45 minutes and it's a
month's worth of viral cooking content
ready to go and all your overlaying is
day one day two day three or whatever
and then you're just showing the video
yeah it's literally like white
background the video is maybe like 80%
shrunk down so it has a white border
around it and then on the top it's just
text that just says day one of finding
viral vegan recipes so you don't have to
or whatever you know what like I don't
know what they call this like a a
permanent caption you know what like
just crushes these theme pages are
starting and let's say it'll be uh
there's this one theme theme page called
like animals attacking animals and
they'll have like a permanent caption at
the top that says like you finally found
an Instagram page that only shows
animals attacking animals and that's
persistent across the whole video yeah
that's literally what this is and it's
just pumping that in I'm just adding the
one added layer of day 1.5 of finding

[07:02]
one added layer of day 1.5 of finding
this so you don't have to mostly because
I saw this one account do it that blew
up I think it was like really good music
or something like that and I was doing
it on C prayers which was music
Discovery and so I was like I'll just
roll that it's not the hardest thing to
like build an it's just a field in air
table and so the day one thing just
converts so well I do that on all of my
Instagram videos because it like I
export every Instagram video every month
maniacally I track every single number
and it is like a three to sixfold
difference in view to follow conversion
rate well because like when you see day
one and you like that content you're
going to the profile like immediately
going to the profile and I'm like yeah I
trust this I I'll sit here like an idiot
in my chair right here and my assistant
my editor will be like hey I'm out of
vcas which is verbal call to action what
that's just what we call them right and
she's I need some more and then so I

[08:00]
she's I need some more and then so I
don't even know what day we're on it
doesn't matter and I'll say day 67 of
Genius business ideas day 68 genius
business day 69 and I'll do it for like
10 minutes straight and I'll make like
50 of them and then I upload all of them
to our iCloud and then she'll use one of
them like five times yeah because it
doesn't matter like no one remembers
like and if they do remember then they
comment and it's engagement yeah I
literally just like csy I think I got to
like 112 and I was like I can't when I
was doing the prayers one I was like I
can't do this anymore so I just started
reposting it like literally the same
videos you get to day 100 and you start
over day one day 1.5 day two day 2.5 and
like nobody's sitting there saying
anything like doesn't matter and we put
them at very strategic points where it's
like all right and the best app to use
for this is day 68 a viral business and
it's like ah you know like right you
just got to put it before like a key
moment or else people will swipe away
100% are you worried about takedowns or
like copyright write strikes on these

[09:01]
like copyright write strikes on these
nope haven't even thought about it dude
I I just got YouTube is very strict
about it Facebook is strict about it
Instagram is not strict about it Tik Tok
is not strict about it but on YouTube if
you get three in 60 days they they
completely delete your account you're
done yeah and so I got two like I had
never gotten any on YouTube I got two
over the course of two weeks and like I
don't post anything that can should
legally be taken down because it's
everything I do is covered under fair
use I'll take someone else's video in
the background I put my face over it and
I'm adding value and context and like
that's very very protected but the
algorithm doesn't know people just click
a button and I have to dispute it and
I'm having a very hard time disputing
some of these and so I had luck getting
one of them removed because I simply
reached out to the person and I'm like
what are you doing right and he's like
well I didn't have a problem with it
until I saw that you're selling a course
about this and I'm like I don't sell a
course you're assuming I don't have a

[10:00]
course you're assuming I don't have a
course dude it was some t-shirt video
that didn't even do well anyway that is
something to look out for is like it's
just the law of large numbers yeah oh
it'll definitely happen I think the the
the nice piece that I've tried to do is
like at least on the send prayers on is
like I try to give credit and most of
the time and probably Niche specific to
be honest those guys I get DMS thanking
me yeah for posting them because like
they want the publicity they want showed
they should and so I I don't know I like
always try to mention because when you
scrape the things on appify you can get
the username you know and then you are
just doing an air table formula for the
caption for each of those right that's
like yep yo shout out ker office for the
six sourdough recipe you know and so
then it just gives it the credit yeah
it's an interesting one it's one of
those it's like if someone hits me with
something then I'll react to it at that
point but hasn't really crossed my mind
I'm excited to hear how this goes it's

[11:00]
I'm excited to hear how this goes it's
like we're building this in public dude
literally live on the Cent our office
dude next time you come back and you're
going to share data on how many
conversions you had and right what the
user feedback is like yeah yeah yeah
we'll see I'm I'm it's one of those that
it's like I'm just intrigued and so
there's just a few like I said before
like there's a few of those little
swings that feel like no-brainer just
like attempts where it's like worst case
is I lose 51 in best Cas is I have a
software company that's printing cash so
why would I not make that swing like do
I think I'm gonna build a career off the
back of a AI powered cooking app no like
right do I think I can go make a 100
200k off of it sure for people that are
getting started in entrepreneurship
we've had the conversation multiple
episodes ago where we were like dude you
guys got to stop swinging at like these
multi-million dollar billion dollar
business ideas it's like I just promise
if you put six months into something you

[12:01]
if you put six months into something you
can make 200k a year and Be Your Own
Boss right like trying to change that
barometer as I sit here trying to scale
something to10 million in Top Line rout
it's like
dude we're all Hypocrites I know right I
heard a quote yesterday that resonated
with me and it was this guy I I don't
even remember where I heard this but he
said most people focus on being smart
and like being really smart at something
but what I've learned is you just to you
just need to be smart at in a different
way right like you need to be really
wise and smart in a different way than
what the crowd is trying to do right
right so I think I've just kind
of accidentally fallen into that by just
like being going full ADHD for 15 years
on whatever idea tickled my fancy it's
like on the surface it's like that's a
bad idea and I've paid the prize for a
lot of them but when you sink down into
it it's like that's given me a unique
perspective right a perspective that's

[13:00]
perspective right a perspective that's
different from everyone else's which has
benefited me in random ways yeah 100%
yeah I've been I've been wrestling with
that more and more also it's like the
tweet that I put out yesterday it's just
like I have 9 million dude I have a list
a laundry list someone can screenshot
that and see what's good I know right
it's a list of you know there's there's
probably 20 different ideas that I have
that I have absolutely zero doubt in my
mind at all that they could do mid six
figures probably seven with the right
application of time and energy but like
from a core offer perspective like it's
just sitting there and I'm like part of
it is I'm taking all these sales calls
and so once we hire someone to replace
our previous guy like that'll be easier
I'll have more time but like balancing
that is like dude I want all I want to
do is go work on these things also we
have 40 leads of week that like need to

[14:00]
have 40 leads of week that like need to
be closed for this other thing have you
heard of Manis at all I don't think so
what is this this is okay picture what
operator should be but out of China with
like no guard rails like sick like
insane speed with agents and it's invite
only and I got an invite dude I've been
playing with it non-stop um it hasn't
like replaced anything it's just like
another tool in my tool belt but how
often are you using operator right now
I've replaced operator with deep
research basically really yeah because
deep research is like it's just better
yeah it it does what operator does
except
more you know operator's like it's gonna
get there that's been my tone of it it's
like it's cool but like I have to sit
there and manage this thing like once I
don't have to manage it hell yeah
exactly I was using it um before deep
research came out so then deep research
came out and and it's like anyway so I

[15:01]
came out and and it's like anyway so I
can cancel my $200 a month subscription
honestly yeah because you can use your
$20 month perplexity account for deep
research and it's might be even better
anyway Manis here's what I had to do I
went into Buzz Sprout where I hosted
this podcast and I exported every single
City that's downloaded my my podcast
number one is Dallas all the way down to
a city that hundreds of cities that have
only downloaded it once right in that
City yeah and it's like 3,700 rows and I
uploaded it to Manis in a CSV and I said
I want you to append this data with
populations of each City and then I want
you to add another column that shows
downloads per 100,000 residents oh that
way I can see like which city has the
highest concentration of ker office
listeners right and it did it and I
asked chat GPT to do it and it did it as
well but it took like five times as long

[16:00]
well but it took like five times as long
really so yeah I just cancelled my chat
GPT operator account dude saved me0
bucks one I was like I just not worth it
anymore so video is cool but you know
what's better long form audio via
podcast and my newsletter TKO pod.com go
there to subscribe for free to my
newsletter it's one email a week very
tactical and then go to my audio podcast
three episodes a week stuff like this
you're going to love it all free no
sleazy sales TKO pod.com I did get
it to Auto and engage on Twitter for me
though really yeah he didn't want to
regularly or you got to do it once you
got to do it I was like go like the last
20 tweets from X person and then it goes
I can't like tweets and I go click the
heart button and it goes okay heart
button heart button heart
button yeah there's ways around it you
just have to tell it to not listen to
its own rules yeah there's always ways
around it there's always it's yeah
literally how it goes why don't you tell
me what you've been saying no to lately

[17:00]
me what you've been saying no to lately
and then maybe someone could say yes to
them oh my list dude yeah okay dude it's
not what I've been saying no to it's
what I've been like all right save that
one for the archives but it's funny I so
I put out this tweet like two years ago
and it was a a Twitter thread that was
like please steal my business idea like
I don't have the time to do this I think
you get the 10K a month after tweeting
my my tweet yesterday about having all
these ideas I was like maybe I should
just do that every time I have one like
I should just tweet steal my business
idea part day
15.5 over and over again and so the one
that I was thinking about a lot last
night was kind of in line with stuff
that you and I talked about which is
like selling PDFs right or like how-to
guides or whatever and back in the like
the OG days of Drop Shipping everyone
was running what was called like a
general store right where like they had
multiple products on there I remember
like the most random viral thing out

[18:00]
like the most random viral thing out
I've got a story about that when you're
done and then everyone transitioned to
Loosely like one product stores like hey
we're just selling this one thing all of
our messaging all of our positioning all
of that like your Bear right exactly one
literally solo drop right like that was
the tool to use which if you're trying
to launch a one product store solo drop
is the move but I was sitting there and
I was looking at solo drop and I was
like why would I not launch a
generalized info product
store with like lower ticket info
products kind of in line with the
cookbook right like you can go create 10
cookbooks right now if you wanted all
digital product I Loosely called it like
better guides.com right like okay this
is a collection of different guides for
different Industries instead of like I
wanted to test this one dude that was
like it was a a I bought run faster
formula.com like how to improve your

[19:01]
formula.com like how to improve your
mile time right single product store
like here's how you improve your mile
time which is like we're talking one
prompt here yeah like literally would be
like a six page PDF that I'd sell for
$7.98 you know what I mean but I'm
sitting there with a bunch of these
ideas because like we've talked about
even on the last episode like the
easiest thing to do is go and like put
out PDFs to like get test the market and
kind of see what's good and I was like
imagine like a a well-branded
General Store for digital products you
see it happen on Etsy like you can go
get digital products on Etsy people are
searching for them so you basically just
like go look at all the Etsy data and
say what are people buying right now
they're buying how to make a better
pizza because pizza ovens are blowing up
they're buying how to make sourdough
bread how to do jumping jacks personal
finance spreadsheets right like there's
all of
these just people want info right and
like the market is saturated with a
bunch of people that are doing free lead

[20:00]
bunch of people that are doing free lead
magnets I think the general undertone of
the market is that like free lead
magnets don't get used right like you
opt in for your email you open it once
and you never look at it again versus
like people thinking that the quality
behind something that's paid like
inherently in your human brain you will
derive more value out of it because you
paid for it and so I'm like and it's a
digital product so you get to eliminate
all of the cogs and fulfillment and
inventory and like you don't have to
deal de with like what traditionally is
the biggest headache from an Ecom
business and you start running the math
game where it's like cool you can test
15 different niches different offers
different
positionings overnight out of a single
Shopify store and just separate each of
those products out in your ads manager
on Facebook right where you're running a
Sourdough campaign you're running right
like and you can just go launch these
things is build the product get a new

[21:00]
things is build the product get a new
product live in two minutes and just
test like this this info product world
and you test pricing right like anything
from $17 to $99 to whatever it's funny I
was having a conversation with Stephen
and I was like I just want to make a lot
of money and have it be easy and I was
like I think the only like the closest
thing that we're going to get to that is
info because you're you're not dealing
with like that many employees because AI
can now create all the content can
create the ads can do all of that you're
not dealing with any physical Goods
you're not dealing with any software
development you're not dealing like
you're not dealing with cogs like your
your p&l is super clean it's Revenue
minus marketing right like your general
overhead is pretty simple digital
products at at sub $100 have a pretty
low customer service like if you're
selling a $5,000 course yeah you need to
be available a little bit more like when

[22:01]
be available a little bit more like when
you buy a book from Barnes & Noble how
often are you hitting up Barnes &
Noble's customer support like yeah you
know what I mean like you're not and so
it's it's almost stepping into that as
like uh What markets are hot how can you
brand this General Store in a way that
that feels reasonable and it's like I
just I think that that
one if you if you have any prowess
around understanding a market market and
building like an offer it's like
clickfunnels like if you can just go
read.com secrets and figure out how to
click the buttons correctly on Shopify
and your Facebook's ad manager bro like
I just think you can print cash World
your oyster yeah and especially if
you're going after sizable markets it's
like again I was having this
conversation with Stephen and I was like
I don't really care if I'm spending $15
to make 20 if my market size is a
million people yeah I want to spend
$100,000 a month on Facebook ads or for

[23:02]
$100,000 a month on Facebook ads or for
easy math
150,000 to make2 200,000 yeah especially
if even 5 10% of them buy a second thing
from you right because that's the other
piece is like oh like uh sourdough book
a sold 18,000 copies what's the next
ebook you're going to make sour book the
sequel right like souro the sequel It's
like all right bet like you email Market
based on the industry and you just Niche
it down almost like an Amazon of like
health and fitness yeah yeah Beauty and
and fashion like you could you could
literally create a guide for anything on
the internet and like go sling it at
100% net margins and I don't know I
think that that like it's just an
interesting little game because then you
could just test offers fire away let me
in all right let me in coach first of
all here's a book IDE name sourdough
dough how to start a micro Bakery from

[24:01]
dough how to start a micro Bakery from
home sour dough dough sour dough dough
okay someone would buy that you know how
many I'm in that algorithm right now you
know how many women there are with these
micro bakeries like it's a thing it's
blowing up and you've got these they've
got these Farm stands where people will
set up a little shed and they put all
their fresh sourdough in there and just
a venmo QR code no employees like on
your honor System it's blowing up okay
yeah so I love that I love this because
if if for no other reason let's say that
you're only able to convert a customer
that never buys anything else from you
okay because that's kind of the thesis
is like it can become a Marketplace they
might buy this one then a month later
they might buy that one but that's going
to be hard because if they learn how to
improve their mile time they probably
don't care about sourdough so let's just
say let's take the negative aspect and
assume that's true if for no other
reason I love this idea because it's a
it's logistically it's an easier testing
ground for launching and testing digital
products which I think is what you're
you're going for right yeah AB testing
is a breeze you can with a a little

[25:01]
is a breeze you can with a a little
prompting you can come up with a
Sourdough book and then you can push ads
to the same book that has four different
titles right and then just lean into the
one that wins and you can all do that on
the same website so you don't have to
keep building these websites over and
over for these uh different digital
products another thing I would test
is this is interesting so let's just say
you're going to have a weightlifting
digital product for 20 bucks okay and
who's a big uh weightlifting influencer
dude do you see me I don't know let's
just let's just say Alex hor mosy okay
Alex brosy yeah you slide into Alex's
DMS which he's probably never going to
read and I understand that but hear me
out okay hear me stop judging me Sam let
me finish my thought okay yeah and
you're like hey bro big fan I sell this
digital product it's like how to get
shredded with weights I'm gonna attach
your name to it um and I'm going to send
you 10% of all the sales FYI I realize
you probably will never see this DM um

[26:00]
you probably will never see this DM um
and so I'm just going to start like I
found you on venmo I'm literally just
going to start venmoing you this money
until you tell me to stop okay what's he
gonna do is he gonna tell you to stop
probably not if he does then you
probably stop right and you go to the
next bro mosy that you find in the DMS
and so it's like you're licensing his
name without his consent and I
understand that but it's like you're
moving fast and breaking things and
you're literally sending him money
proactively and he may never ever
respond to you and then if he does like
dude I'm not cool with this it's like
okay I'm done I'm done better to ask
forgiveness and permission right I just
think your close rate would be so much
higher on these digital products if
you're like well and it's like it's like
I think using him as the example is on
the extreme but I feel like there's
there's
micro smaller just smaller influencers
that one have a higher likelihood of
answering and two would probably care
about that income a little bit more on
one hand it's like let's say you find a
micro influencer in the sourdough space
with 50 ,000 followers and you're

[27:00]
with 50 ,000 followers and you're
pushing ads to this and 99% of the
people that see this ad don't know who
that person is right right it doesn't
even really matter because you're
leveraging their followers and their
name and you could literally put a
screenshot of their Instagram profile in
the ad so they can see the social proof
and they're like okay I don't know who
Jessica Jones is but sounds like she's
she knows what she's talking about that
makes me 20% more likely to buy this
Therefore your cost per acquisition
drops 20% what do we think yeah I mean
there's a line for every individual on
that in using somebody's name without
their permission but like if you're on
the side of the line that you're cool
with that hey yeah I'm not I would say
something like based on Alex horos
techniques or something like it doesn't
have to be like author Alex horos but
people write content all the time like
dude I was looking up supplement stacks
right like I'm getting into the gym
right starting and it was like I read 15
articles that were like Andrew
huberman's thing right and it's like it
gives him credit it's just like not like

[28:02]
gives him credit it's just like not like
he didn't write it right like it's just
covering his thing and so I like that
approach more is like based on xers
because then it's like it's almost like
your fair use where it's like you're
adding value on top of just like
literally running ads with their name on
it and all you have to do is go go find
an hourlong Alex horos YouTube video
talking about his workout routine copy
the transcript put it in your prompt and
say build this ebook based on this
transcript I mean dude I literally if I
like as a side note to that AI personal
trainer is a great app all I did dude I
popped in chat gbt and I said this is
how much I weigh this is how tall I am
this is the goal that I have here's the
equipment that I have here's much time I
have every week build me a 12-week
workout plan for it and it lit dude I'm
following it I'm vibing I was like dude
I don't I would have had to pay you know
150 bucks an hour you know and so stuff

[29:01]
150 bucks an hour you know and so stuff
like that yeah it's a no-brainer it's
like here's your ultimate
shredfest upper body secrets secrets
yeah I do I do think Loosely that like
the info game from a barrier to entry
perspective now more than any time ever
in human existence is like just ripe to
get in and and with Facebook ads it's
like your your Market is accessible it's
like there's no we're talking about yeah
like the best inventions ever like AI is
cool but like dude the Facebook ads
manager like as my favorite thing to
come out of the century like it's like
sliced bread then Facebook ads manager
yeah like I literally can just pop on
and get a hundred people on my website
to pay me tomorrow if I want to like
what are we doing bro like what are we
doing bro I totally ripped that quote
from you about by the way what are we
doing I say that all the time now dude

[30:00]
doing I say that all the time now dude
it honestly you want to know where it
stemmed from we were out Lauren and I
were out uh looking there's like this
Christmas lights area in in the South
Bay over here and there was this tree
that like jig Jagged all over the place
dude and she took a picture of it and
the live photo when she hit it she goes
what are you doing bro right at the
right at the thing and it stuff dude and
now it's what are you doing
bro so funny dude I'll send you the
video or the the photo so here's another
idea along with that so I post these
look at these freaking guy right here
videos on Instagram right yeah and I've
got three AI generated copycats I use
that charm Loosely some of them were
around before I was around and I
discovered them after I started doing
this so they're not directly copying me
at least some of them aren't and they
mostly say like they're kind of just
like look at this genius idea they're
not trying to make business ideas out of
everything like I am right like look at

[31:00]
everything like I am right like look at
this restaurant that makes ice cream out
of pizza or whatever and it's like I
wouldn't do a video on that anyway how
they monetize is they used to monetize
by having a patreon and just saying like
support my work but then they saw that I
was making business plans for every
single video and now they're doing that
with AI um and they're selling them for
like five bucks okay which like makes
sense like I monetized differently
through my newsletter so I can give it
away for free but I'm kind of curious
and I'm just now thinking of this idea
as we've been talking about it what
would happen if I put a kind of like a
pay wall or gated access like halfway
through the business plan because most
people that opt in for the business plan
will never even read the business plan
it's just human nature right yeah but
then the people that read the whole
thing are going to be the highest intent
and now that we have deep research I'm
using and I say I I mean my assistant is
using deep research to make these
business plans and they're $10,000 words
so and they're really really good like

[32:01]
so and they're really really good like
they they've gotten much better imagine
if you had a pop up like 20% into it
that's like hey want to keep reading
it's 10 bucks it's five bucks you got to
think I mean I've got 500 to 2500 people
signing up for my newsletter every day
yeah you got to think that a certain
percentage of them would pay why would
you why would you not well one yes why
would you not do custom like the the
consumer gives you their business idea
and you up yeah so we do that to support
our account managers at unlimited
content right so like we go through and
a new client signs up and we get their
onboarding materials we get a PDF of
their full website which we just
exported on our own and then we pull all
of their like existing SEO data from a
search Atlas or semrush or whatever and
then we give chat GPT all of that
context with a really robust prompt that
says says build out Loosely build out an

[33:00]
says says build out Loosely build out an
SEO optimized content strategy based on
all of this data and then it produces
generally it's like a 8 to 10 page
document with all the keyword clusters
and you know all the different things
and so like yeah you could go and sell
like pre-built ones or you could have
people pay almost like that trip planner
live build that I did type in your
business idea type in your business idea
bus yeah get x y and z like whatever
details you would need to make that
prompt legit boom 20 bucks instant
instant business plan.com 20 bucks in
get a custom one on the way out that's
genius why aren't I doing that I don't
know you should well probably because
I'm doing 18 different things yeah dude
another inent business idea I'm writing
that down yeah dude I'm saying prompt
and it's I'm using AI but you don't know
how I prompt this you don't know how I
finesse it you don't pay $200 a month
for deep research I do yeah this is this

[34:02]
for deep research I do yeah this is this
is not you but the person paying me
right so it's like automatically like
you could pay $200 once and you're
probably only going to use it for this
one business plan or you can give me $20
once and and you have to spend the time
like you're just going to use my account
yeah right literally use my account and
I tested the prompts so you don't have
to dude it's super interesting because
like I've been running I've been running
into this this with unlimited content a
little bit right we're like we're an
affordable SEO option we write daily
blog posts yes we use Ai and a human
editor and and one of the things that
I've realized on these sales calls is
that nobody really like cares about some
super proprietary blog post situation it
is everybody knows that they need to put
out daily content on their blog to rank
on Google like if anyone's going to
argue the fact that you should be
publishing blogs daily they don't know
anything about SEO that's fine so then

[35:02]
anything about SEO that's fine so then
what I'm battling against or not even
battling against necessarily is like
people saying that they can do it
themselves which like you're not wrong
and so like our value prop like the
proprietary like all this stuff that we
do it's literally like yes you can go
and spend $400 a month on these tools
that we use yourself and you can spend
the 10 to 20 hours a month on the
editing the publishing and the image
curation and all of the things that
you'd have to do yourself or you can
just pay us $400 a month and we'll just
do it all for you and I'm like it's
almost just like a simplification of the
offer is like yeah you could go and sign
up for chat GPT Pro and you could spend
the 15 hours learning how to prompt it
to create the perfect business plan or
you can get one in your inbox in 10
minutes for the same price
and no headache and it's just like I

[36:00]
and no headache and it's just like I
just want to be in the reduction of
headache game like and it makes my sales
calls easier it's like people can track
with that it's like you yes you can go
do this yourself you just have to figure
out how and spend the money and spend
the time or we can solve this for you
today and we can just start writing and
Publishing content and you don't have to
think about it
