here is a $20,000 a month business idea
that you could launch by the end of
today there are 30 million small
businesses in America and almost none of
them ask for reviews but you can
automate all of this with software so
you start by going to this website and
you can set up a flow that looks like
this and I'll give you the link later
that does something genius let's say a
business owner in your town owns a
restaurant and they want to ask for a
five-star review but they don't want
that accidentally lead to more four or
lower star reviews so what this software
will do will send an automated text to
their customers that says hey how was
your experience and then they can vote
one to five stars if it's anything less
than five stars then it will direct them
to email the owner instead of to their
Google my business profile but if they
choose five stars then it will send them
to the Google my business profile and
say cool please leave a FIV star review
here so you're only getting reviews that
are five stars it's genius and it will
make your customers more money and you
can charge $500 a month for this out of
30 million small businesses do you think
you can convince a hundred to pay you
$500 a month if so that's 50 Grand a
month and it's almost all profit full
