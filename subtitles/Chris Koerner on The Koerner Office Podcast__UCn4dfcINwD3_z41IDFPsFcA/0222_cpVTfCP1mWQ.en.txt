okay so what does this headline have to
do with your next side hustle let me
tell you so we all know that Elon bought
Twitter and Elon owns Tesla therefore
anytime anyone tweets about Tesla the
Twitter algorithm happens to love it I
know this because I've tweeted about my
Tesla 8 to 10 times and almost all of
them have gone viral also just yesterday
Tesla reinstated their referral program
so if you use a referral link then you
as a Tesla buyer can get $1,000 off your
car and as the referrer they can get
$500 so I just tweeted about my Tesla
today it's going viral I through a
referral Link in at the end and people
are already buying Teslas with my link
here's how you can profit you can create
a Twitter account that is solely
dedicated to covering all things Elon
Tesla Twitter will be much more likely
to make your tweets go viral because
you're tweeting about Tesla and then you
can use a referral link to monetize $500
at a time or go listen to this episode
of my podcast and you can find out how
to partner with people like Sawyer
Meritt who already have Tesla accounts
that are not monetizing well enough
