[00:00]
this new framework I have is if some
sort of a business or Creator or someone
with an audience is just selling
T-shirts then it means they don't know
what they're doing because when you go
to sell a t-shirt that's the first thing
that people that don't really have a
business brain think of how do I do
let's sell a hat let's sell a t-shirt
but in almost every instance and I can
think of one exception that is not going
to be the highest and best
[Music]
use so I got more ideas
I got I'm full of ideas today okay all
right do you follow the Instagram
account nature is metal no
oh you have not what you love in Russian
dash cam fight videos I love in watching
animals kill each other okay what yes
and me and 7even million other Instagram
followers so nature is metal is a very
very popular Instagram account that just
shows like random home videos of a bear

[01:00]
shows like random home videos of a bear
attacking a moose on the side of a road
or an eagle picking up a salmon and
dropping it like it is the coolest stuff
quick aside I'm not saying it was
right but I get why the Romans had the
Coliseum and were like I want to see a
lion fight a bear it's awesome like who
would win a lion or a bear yeah I don't
know I don't know I got to find out we
can't do that now it's like taboo you
can't do that yeah they started with
that then they're like I want to see if
Greg could kill
JN all right let's give Greg some
numchucks let's give JN a lance okay
okay okay that's boring I want to see if
Greg and Jon could kill a
lion two Gregs on Lion two lions on Greg
there are so many computations of this
Cesar we we really got to try this for a
couple hundred years anyway if I go to
Nature's medals uh homepage you've got
you've got a bobcat attacking a squirrel

[02:02]
you've got a bobcat attacking a squirrel
you've got a bunch of snails attacking a
Portuguese Mana War you've got a a
crocodile eating a baby hippo you've got
a guy wearing Lululemon pants wrestling
an alligator on the road like so cool it
is so cool and I followed these guys
when they had 500,000 followers now they
have 6.1 million okay so I was thinking
about often times I'll see a cool social
media account that's not really
monetizing and it just it pains me it
pains me because 99% of people are not
going to create content and that's great
I that's fine but I think for all the
entrepreneurs out there listening to
this and wanting to start a business
it's all right in front of your face
when you're wasting time on social media
these accounts you follow have no idea
how to monetize and so right I have this
framework that I just thought up where
if you hold on or let me just say it in
a different way they're
monetizing to a level that they think is

[03:01]
monetizing to a level that they think is
good they're like oh
I'm that's what I'm getting at this new
framework I have is if some sort of a
business or Creator or someone with an
audience is just selling T-shirts then
it means they don't know what they're
doing because when you go to sell a
t-shirt that's like the that's the first
thing that people that don't really have
a business brain think of how do I do
let's sell a hat let's sell a t-shirt
but in almost every instance and I can
think of one exception that is not going
to be the highest and best use now it's
great because you you've got a walking
advertisement right that's cool but
unless you are a merch or a clothing
company you're probably just selling
t-shirts and hats because you don't know
else how else to make money right right
so nature is metal that's how they make
money they sell t-shirts so they'll post
a video of a squid eating a turtle and
then at the end of it there will be just
like a quick flash of like new shirt in
stock on our website and it's like you
can't even click these links in a real

[04:01]
can't even click these links in a real
you someone has to go type in naturism
metal.com they're not going to do that
like their conversion must be terrible
on these shirts here's why I hate this
business model and you will agreee with
me it's the inventory now they probably
are doing this stuff on like Consignment
or I don't know the exact term but but
to scale their business quickly it's not
going to be selling
T-shirts you know this from from send
eats and Texas snack like it's a hard
business model operationally to execute
well and again I know they're not the
ones who are actually doing it but it
just it would be not it would not be
what I pick yeah they're probably doing
print on demand so they don't need to
have inventory they don't need to have a
warehouse or anything but it that just
means that their margins suck right
right there's just a trade-off you print
your own shirts you got inventory
headaches but you have great margin
print on demand you don't have to do any
work but your margin sucks either way
you lose and so I just it pains me that
this website is is monetizing by

[05:01]
this website is is monetizing by
t-shirts I feel like nature is metal
could be like the National Geographic of
the Next Generation like this could be a
whole media brand it could be a whole
media because it's really hard to
monetize an audience outside of what
that audience is let me say it a
different way I would bet that let's say
40% of their viewers are 30 to 40y old
white guys okay typically speaking I'm
overgeneral generalizing but 30 to 40y
old white guys AKA millennials in
America are generally a a pretty good
demographic to sell things to right
they're midcareer they make decent money
but and so let's say all right you're
going to take that knowledge and sell I
don't know what would you sell to a 35y
old white guy right now yeah pickle ball
paddles pickle ball paddles perfect yeah
or something health related yeah yeah
but and so okay yeah they're here to
watch nature videos but these guys are
playing pickleball so let no it would
not do well at all because that's not

[06:00]
not do well at all because that's not
why they like you that's not why they're
looking just because they're buying that
stuff even on a daily basis doesn't mean
they they'll ever want to buy it from
you that's not their reason for looking
at your content right so you have to
find a product audience fit for the
people watching that and the people
watching that want to watch more of that
and so I feel like you could have a like
a a Netflix for animal attacking animals
attacking other animals right two bucks
a month five bucks a month and it's just
a funnel you find them on their
Instagram account and then if you want
to see the rest of this video or if you
want to see 13 more videos just like
this click go to naturism metal.com I
think about how many experiences they
could sell right like a company that
does African safaris or a company that
does Alaskan Alaskan hunting tours or F
fishing or just Farm it all out yeah
like it's literally just funneling them
to what they're interested in now the
hard part is like identifying what
they're interested in but from an
experience standpoint that would be I
think very easy or even a company like

[07:00]
think very easy or even a company like
dicks or a company like Sports Chalet or
what's the really big one that has like
the pyramid in Memphis Bass Pro Shops
Bass Pro Shop Right like some type of
affiliate relationship or an agreement
with them because Hunters are more apt
to watch that channel yeah there's so
many other things that you can do it's
actually leading me to this idea as
we're talking do you remember when 10
years ago maybe even more 10 15 years
ago these digital agencies started
popping up and they would go to Boomer
businesses and be like
hey John's Barbecue Restaurant you're
not even marketing was like well yeah I
am I got a website like yeah but there's
no reviews you don't have any content
and it like this whole industry of of
digital marketing SEO payperclick Etc
popped up around these Boomer business
owners who didn't know how to utilize
that I think I think that's happening
right now on a much smaller scale around
content where people are building
businesses around health helping content

[08:00]
businesses around health helping content
creators monetize Their audience where
like in the past taking the website
analogy of Bob's whatever barbecue
restaurant he just threw up a website
content creators now are like I sell
t-shirts I'm making money selling
T-shirts it's like no there's a better
way you're not you're just you're not
even monetizing and I met a guy at Main
Street who does this where he literally
helps Brands launch companies off of
their audiences it was like just
fascinating to talk to them because a
lot of people don't think of it this way
yeah I mean KSI and Logan Paul did this
with like starting years ago so I think
people that are like in the and in the
MFM Twitter bubble are like oh it's
being done it's played out I think we're
way early on that curve and can I tell
you something interesting it's relevant
but not as okay whenever we talk about
being a content creator or creating
content the retention on our podcast
drops like people tune
out did you know that yeah huh and this
is pretty meta we're getting pretty meta
here yeah but it it's it it totally

[09:02]
here yeah but it it's it it totally
meshes with a newsletter I sent out
three months ago that was basically how
to grow on Twitter right it was my worst
voted yeah like it was really like the
people in your group loved it because
they're self- selected to want that
stuff I had another new newsletter about
how to go viral on Reddit it did not do
well at all because I have a poll at the
end of every newsletter right subscribe
at Chris j.com go well it didn't and
that's fine I feel like I'm creating
content now and it's almost we're just
in this world we're in it we're already
here so let's just keep leaning into it
but I think if you reroll my life eight
times out of 10 I'm not creating content
for a business I'm just doing business
right like I accidentally fell into this
anyway my point is I'm the opposite if
you reol my life I'm doing content eight
times out of 10 that's true music this
like it's something yeah so all that to
be said I want to be very clear I'm
trying to sell the idea that people
listening or watching this that are
business

[10:00]
business
should start businesses with creators
not that they should create their own
content because that's a grind and it
takes you years to ever see a dollar
from it but you can skip the line by
finding creators there are zillions of
like small 5,000 to 100,000 follower
creators that have loyal audiences that
have really good content that don't know
what to do and you want to know a niche
where I see this a ton is
comedy people and you see it on Twitter
too right if you see these comedic
Twitter accounts less so on Twitter than
on Tik Tok and Instagram but people that
are just really
funny people don't want to buy stuff
from funny people if that's their brand
right hear me out if you're Nick keski
and your brand is how to buy a business
and you're funny that's the cherry on
top that makes you better but if your
brand is funny and i' we've talked about
this You' you're like I should open a
parody account and don't do it because
people don't buy from them Robert
Sterling is an example of that like I'm
just curious to see how he's I'm sure
he's doing fine but he's funny he's like

[11:01]
he's doing fine but he's funny he's like
got a parody account and sometimes he
tweets something beautiful and
insightful and poetic and I read it and
it I think everyone has the same filter
not just that but people are like is he
being for real is this a joke are we
where's the joke in here Chris baky is
another one like every now and then
he'll say something serious and it's
like is this and that's friction the
last thing you want is for people to
have friction when they're reading your
content I I think what you're
articulating is the fact that in
business distribution is incredibly
important in fact like there's a saying
in the Venture world first time Founders
focus on product second time Founders
focus on distribution because it doesn't
matter how good your product is if you
can't sell it and you can't sell it
without people knowing about what your
product is so you have to know what
distribution is and that's for me that's
why I become so obsessed with content I
think that's why You' become so
obsessive content it's because all of a
sudden it's like whoa this is a cheat
code if you do good content you build an
audience I have distribution and then I

[12:01]
audience I have distribution and then I
can do whatever business because I'm
business agnostic I'm not dogmatic about
which types of businesses I invest in
I'm agnostic I just want to be
interested in the business and have
employees that I can take care of and
that I can gamify and make sure that I'm
growing so all of a sudden if I have
then an audience it makes my ability to
choose whatever business I want much
easier and I can leverage that into
selling and take audience take social
media out of it if you have a business
you have to figure out how to sell that
business period I mean I don't mean sell
it like right sell your product or
service sell your product so how you
going to do it and is it payperclick is
it SEO is it the best way to do it is to
build trust and the best way to build
trust at scale is through social media
so that's why for us I know we're
obsessed with it right now well and even
more so if you're actually doing
business things or have done business
things because 80 90% of guys out there
have not like they they tasted making
money on content and they're like oh

[13:00]
money on content and they're like oh
content is the business right whereas
people like Alex horos they're actually
doing things and he's actually done
things and that's why he has millions of
followers because I would argue he's not
a guru I would argue that a guru is
someone that hasn't actually done or is
doing things yeah well I talked to a I
talked to I talked to a YouTuber this
week that I can't
name I'll tell you
offline h I'm very rich anyways there's
two camps people who know YouTube and
people who know
business and on YouTube I knew more
about business than 95% of the YouTubers
and then of the guys who actually knew
business I knew 95% more about YouTube
than they knew about YouTube that's why
I hit this Niche and I grew and and
business has been fantastic because he
understood the distribution as well as
the product where sometimes people just
focus on the product I'm not here to
grow my audience quality if you build it

[14:01]
grow my audience quality if you build it
they'll
come yeah I don't worry about that I
don't worry about that I don't look at
the numbers the guy who says he doesn't
look at the numbers cannot take his eyes
off the numbers let's get real spoiler
alert he looks at the
numbers I got something else for you you
ready
go I do have more about the content
stuff but I'm gonna I don't want people
to stop listening so I'll save that for
another pod how's that for transparency
all right I went to a concert last night
with my son Brady and I'm wearing a
shirt right
now okay if you're watching on YouTube
Tak him back Sunday I've seen this band
probably 17 times more than any other
band in my life great band and have they
taken back Sunday yet they're still
working at it wow it's a grind man It's
a Grind something very interesting
happened at the show so this was at the
Southside Ballroom which is in Downtown
Dallas s and I would guess there were
two to three thousand people there okay
m standing room only got one big stage

[15:01]
m standing room only got one big stage
couple bars on each side and why what's
so funny whenever I hear standing room
only I always think of oh there was so
many people there and you're like so
there's 35 people there standing room
only there are literally no chairs
so anyway it was packed but there no
there were no chairs there's no seats
right and something interesting happened
so you know that time in between sets
the opener comes out they sing they sung
10 songs and then Tak next Sunday had to
set up all their gear and it takes
longer than it should took 45 minutes
and so at minute 35 Adam lazara who's
the lead singer his voice came out and
everyone knows his voice and they're
like hey guys this is Adam lazara and
everyone starts cheering they're like oh
he's coming out he's coming out because
the moment when the artist comes out is
just magical right yeah yeah and he's
like hey guys is Adam lazara hey while
you're waiting go ahead and pull out
your phones open your browser and type
in set. live that's a website set. live

[16:01]
in set. live that's a website set. live
and you go to that website and enter
your email and you're going to be
entered to win a personalized video from
me a free t-shirt and maybe you can come
out on tour with us yeah it was a
commercial okay I don't I've never heard
killer I that but I've never heard of
set. Live And I yes it was because it
was a kind of a it was a bait and switch
oh Adam he's coming out he's coming out
he's coming out hey guys this is Adam
lazara I want you to go to www .
target.com Adam lazario soccerballs for
kids you're like whoa what what just
happened here and I I looked around and
like people were because this is like
this is a new marketing channel I don't
care about set. live I didn't do a deep
dive on them but I care about new
marketing channels okay I start looking
around and it's like mixed some people
are just kind of huh and some people
pull out their phone and I can tell
they're doing it and I'm like this is
very interesting this is why I've
literally been to probably 130 to 150

[17:00]
literally been to probably 130 to 150
shows or concerts right okay I've never
ever experienced this and why not it's a
captive audience it is the most relevant
audience that are in love with one or
two specific things maybe the genre
maybe that artist why aren't people
partnering with artists big and small
from Taylor Swift all the way to unknown
emo band to do this well dude okay like
there's the one tangent which is going
to be all the ideas that you could do
with but then there's the other tangent
what's the one thing you hate when you
send somebody a newsletter or a link or
you're trying to get them to click on
something friction MH right we hate
friction MH why wasn't there like an SMS
push notification why wasn't there a QR
code why wasn't there like something
that made it easier you had to pull out
your phone open Ticket Master had all
our emails yeah you had to open the
browser and type in set. like how many
more people could he have converted by
just having it frictionless or having a

[18:01]
just having it frictionless or having a
QR code displayed on the curtain super
easy hey take your phone out take a
picture of this like it's the easiest
thing in the world but I
guarantee 20% of the audience 20% more
would have clicked on that had it been
easier for them to click on but to
probably the point that you like wanted
to make what a cool way to meet artists
that you've always wanted to meet oh
dude I know wouldn't that be rad I was
watching John Nolan up there on the
guitar thinking that guy's just a dude
he's just he lives in a $600,000 home in
Wilmington North Carolina don't ask me
how I know that and he's got like he's
got like 3,000 Instagram followers or
something and he's one of the most in my
opinion most brilliant artists of our
time and he's just a dude and I want to
have him on the podcast and I want to
ask him how much money do like mid-range
artists like you guys make because we
know what Taylor Swift makes we know
what a guy makes in the bar 100 bucks in
tips what did you make what was your
best year ever are you a millionaire
from this do you make a hundred grand a

[19:01]
from this do you make a hundred grand a
year where do does your money come from
t-shirts does it come from Spotify does
it come from touring like I know you can
Google some of this stuff but I actually
found a viral YouTube oh my gosh dude
hear me out hear me out I know I know
keep going One Way on YouTube if you
want to see what's trending what's
popular is find find a YouTube creator
that has one or more videos that like
100x the amount of views as subscribers
right mhm so so I there's this random
Nashville country guy no one's ever
heard of him he has like 5,000
subscribers and had no he had a video
called how much do touring musicians
make okay okay how much do touring
musicians make and it had millions of
views because it's a question that's not
answered on the internet I've literally
been asking this since I was in high
school I'm just so curious to know these
guys that play in 3,000 to 5,000 person
stadiums is that good money and I can do
the math I can you know and it Chang is
there's a reason why they sell merch

[20:00]
there's a reason why they sell merch
it's because they don't make all the
gate right they have to pay the venue in
order to rent it they have a crew like
they've got Spotify screws them Spotify
screws them and so their merch is where
they make a lot of money but what you're
saying is blowing my mind because what
we saw great we're going back to content
what we saw on Twitter over the last
five years are these big accounts
learning how to monetize and turning it
into a
business how has how could that be
applied to to
other platforms that have audience music
is one of them right music is one of
them I'm I'm trying to think of
something else because he's he may not
necessarily be huge on Instagram or
Twitter but if he puts out that he's
playing a show he's going to get I don't
know 250,000 people to come to his shows
right they're going to go on 50 dates
they're going to be all over the country
each show is probably going to have
between five and 10 thousand people
right that's a lot of people and
eyeballs it's high intent so like I get

[21:01]
eyeballs it's high intent so like I get
the set dot live but could you be doing
something
better that is taking advantage of that
audience oh he's nodding my friend you
are a dirty boy okay I'm a dirty boy dir
DS and Chip power through segment number
two um
so I've thought about this before do you
remember at SM bash when that boring guy
spoke
sorry if you're listening but you were
boring oh every talk except mine he the
first thing the first thing he did was
like hey guys I just wrote a book it's
on Amazon it really helps the rankings
if you can uh buy my book and you're all
here in one place I don't think anyone
did it right so that's go against what
I'm about to say but I think you can do
that right and I think you could be the
guru the smart young whipper snapper
that partners with artists like Adam
lazara that knows nothing about business
and you can go in there be like dude
Adam why don't you have a newsletter why

[22:02]
Adam why don't you have a newsletter why
don't you have a podcast oh my go okay
hear me out I'm not there yet stupid I'm
not there yet stupid in a good way oh in
a good way yeah yeah yeah hear me out do
you know what it takes and I think you
do so just play along with me and say
you don't do you know what it takes to
rank a podcast in like the top 50 of
whatever category I actually tried to
research this and I'm not just playing
along I I still don't get it so yeah day
I get like 30 20 to 30 new subscribers
to this podcast okay but if I have a
tweet about the podcast do really really
well I'll get one to 200 in a
day
100 new subscribers in one day on Apple
podcast is enough to put it in the top
50 for a competitive category okay wow
that's not a lot that is absolutely not
a lot so now imagine this imagine Taking
Back Sunday has a podcast oh my gosh yes
I know they have a podcast where it's
like behind the scenes on tour they're

[23:00]
like behind the scenes on tour they're
talking or like behind the songs like
they just need to talk but someone needs
to produce it for them they need to
distribute it they need to help them
with strategy they help them collect
emails why is Adam lazara not saying
Chris himself not hear me out stop from
the stage not a recording not a bait and
switch recording like I heard but like
hey guys we just launched a podcast can
you please it would mean a lot if you
pull out your phones just subscribe
there's no ads we just want to stay in
touch with you that's 2,000 subscribers
not in one night but every night on tour
they have 80 tour dates they could be
like a top five podcast they could
monetize it with ads they could sell
merch through their e-commerce store
like why why isn't every artist doing
that because they don't know they don't
know someone could partner with I'm not
saying that people should go out and
start bands to start a podcast you
should partner with bands like this to
help them with it and take a cut of all
their ads take a 30% cut I'm going to
quote from from a book that both of you
both you and I have read They're kept

[24:01]
both you and I have read They're kept
from the truth cuz they know not where
to find it okay it's true they just
don't know it's true I can't wait for
the four people who like they're gonna
be like I know that they're G to like
text us but dude they just don't know
okay this is crazy you and I purposely
do not send our ideas to each other
because we want it to be fresh right we
call each other the the FaZe Bros
because we keep it so fresh all right
we're out we keep it so fresh and so
clean one of my ideas and this was the
one that I was like I'm not sure I want
to talk about on the
podcast last week I'm going to go on a
little detour here last week my
brother-in-law reached out to me he's on
the board of this conference that's
getting up and started and he's hey we
were talking about getting the word out
for this conference and I said my
brother-in-law do podcasts he could help
you guys get started so they may reach
out to you I'm like Okay cool so they
reach out to me we're having a
conversation and they're going to fly me
out I'm going to go to the conference
help them with some content they're
going to pay me for it it's

[25:01]
going to pay me for it it's
great but as I'm having that
conversation in the back of my mind I've
already been thinking about we should do
a podcast that's Allin for SMB
Twitter and then I think oh Al else we
should do my brother-in-law is really
connected in the sniff space we should
do an all-in podcast for the sniff
space like that would make a lot of
sense mhm and then as I'm thinking this
I get a text from somebody who gets
about 500 to a th000 downloads MH per
episode for their podcast who makes
$3,600 per podcast per episode yep per
per episode and I'm like that's an
outrageous number he shouldn't be making
$3600 per episode but he is and I
started thinking what
if we helped these Niche Industries find
the top four or five people and created
the all-in podcast for those Industries
MH we wouldn't need thousands of

[26:00]
MH we wouldn't need thousands of
listeners or downloads or subscribers
but because they're Niche and they're
high intent and they're going to be
getting listeners we could still charge
per ad slot as if they're getting 10,000
downloads per episode right and they
just don't know how to do it if I went
and listen to listen to a sniff podcast
right now I'd be like hi I'm Julie Baker
and I am the chief ning officer of I
don't want to listen to that I want to
listen to people who have chemistry who
know each other that are funny that are
smart that are compelling that have
actual experience talk about my industry
that's what makes all-in great is every
week I'm like I want to hear the all-in
guys talk about this I can't wait to
tune in and hear what they have to say
and if you could replicate that
throughout all these Niche
Industries and take a cut of that
somehow I don't know exactly what the
business model would look like to me
that's a massive opportunity and so like
you're we had almost the same idea
obviously a little bit different but I
don't know why they're not doing it I
don't know why people aren't doing it
more this is the Agora for podcast do
you remember what Agora newsletters are

[27:02]
you remember what Agora newsletters are
I know I have agor phobia but I don't
know what Agora is this is different
this is I want to say they're like a
$500 million plus company that just has
like what 40 to 60 newsletters that are
all insanely Niche but they're all in
lucrative Industries Health Care
Financial
Services everything and high intent
wealthy yeah yeah they sell
subscriptions to these that are 2 to
3,000 a year plus ads on them and they
print money but if you take like your
average CPM as in what you would get
from an ad in a newsletter it's 10 to
20x that because of how Niche it is the
niche is the rich the niche is that's
the
feature yeah so this is that for podcast
riches and niches that's right I totally
agree especially for artists like they
they already have the skill of holding
attention they already have people who
trust them there's the reason you like
taking back Sundays cuz you like to
listen to their music they already have

[28:01]
listen to their music they already have
the audio aspect dialed in why would
they not launch a podcast it makes no
sense to me that is freaking and they
have all the equipment like they have
the sound guys who could engineer it
they could easily get the mics like
they're used to it they that's their job
their job is like performing in front of
people why not capture that stuff behind
the
scenes yeah how many artists are out
there that you could do this with
thousands and you release it once a week
and you just call it taking back Sundays
we're releasing it on on a Sunday then
yeah is that okay yeah yeah yeah that's
kid it's pretty good it's pretty
good that's a good idea really good that
is a great idea you just copy and paste
the same Playbook with everyone yeah you
do it one time genius that's right what
else you got for me that was it you took
my last idea I just think in general
it's really funny on Twitter and you see
this both with stocks and with crypto
and I used to be I used to be guilty of
this let's say that you're just a crypto
bro and you're Shilling the coinbase

[29:02]
bro and you're Shilling the coinbase
stock okay okay you every time someone
lists out a dozen reasons to buy a stock
and you're going to be able I I hope
you're going to be able to play on this
really well people get much more
ridiculous as they go down the line
right it's like here's 13 reasons why
you should buy coinbase stock number one
they have more cash on their balance
sheet than their market cap is and it's
like oh wow that's legit that's legit
okay number two binance just went
business so now they own the market oh
wow okay yeah that makes sense number
three Brian Armstrong the founder his
mom just got cancer now he has a chip on
his shoulder to really Drive profits
it's like well okay number four coinbase
starts with a c c is the third letter of
the alphabet number five you're like
whoa what wait where did when did we
crossed Rubicon it's just so funny how
it's very clear there's only like a
couple good reasons and they're always
going to be the first two yeah or there
variations of the same reason yeah where
it's like it's like number one coinbase

[30:02]
it's like it's like number one coinbase
has more cash on their balance sheet
than their market cap number two
coinbase could buy every person in
America a Happy Meal if they wanted
number three they have enough cash to
last for 7 months which their
competitors don't you're like okay we
get it they have number five cancer is a
terminal illness so he's really going to
be fired up to drive
profits my favorite with those and I'm
so mad we went away from this was when
they had the headline top 13 Reasons
coinbase is going to annihilate the
competition and then they said number
seven will shock you it got me every
time like I knew I even knew that was
just a tactic and I was like I gotta see
what number seven is I just I still got
to see it I think BuzzFeed invented that
did they they were good at that they
were they were good why don't they do
why don't they do it anymore you
think it's probably just it's hey what
does your boy CK say what's the direct
quote from your boy CK right here

[31:02]
quote from your boy CK right here
iterator die it's not that small micro
triggers me every
time the effectiveness of a growth hack
is directly correlated to its
lifespan the more effective a growth
hack the less time you got to milk that
growth hack and vice
versa okay it's just okay so it's just
not effective anymore yeah yeah it's
played out
that's pretty
funny I I have a personal thing from
this week let's hear it my wife is a pet
person she loves cats freaking loves
cats in fact when we were married and we
didn't have kids Chris would always
tease me that my wife's favorite line
was pets are people too is that why her
nickname for you is peeve pet peeve it
is actually is yeah it's very
interesting but when we had our when we
had Roy I was like I can't have a cat
anymore I can't do it I don't hate cats

[32:00]
anymore I can't do it I don't hate cats
I actually lik them they would always
come sit on my lap and I'd pet them and
they'd purr but they wake me up in the
morning they get my wife calls it the
Zoomies when they they like in the
morning they're like just running around
they got all this energy and I was like
no I don't I don't want to deal with
that anymore okay we have kids M she's
been wearing me down she can we get a
cat can we get a cat I'm like I don't
know and we were like very close to
getting a pet and then we found out Roy
has allergies not only Roy has allergies
good
has allergies OT has allergies like
sweetie I would totally get a cat I
would but for the children I'm sorry I'm
sorry so what does my wife do she goes
on Google she does her research she's
like Nick we can get rid of these
allergies we can take them to the
allergy clinic and with a year and a
half worth of
shots they'd be fine and I was like okay
that's a year that's a year and a half
away what oh okay it's never going to
happen oh we're goingon to we're going
to we're going to stick him full of
mercury for 18 months and then he'll be
safe is that what you're saying
stick a full of

[33:02]
mercury so anyways so my kids go to the
allergy clinic they get treated they're
tested they're like better I don't know
what better means but they're not as
allergic and then at the same time just
to be extra safe she tells me did you
know they that they breed cats and you
can score them on the scale it's like
hypoalergenic cats I'm like oh okay and
so we're looking and we find these cats
and they're like the best cats and they
take their saliva and they test their
saliva to see how much allergy they have
in their blood piss I don't know what
the word is whatever and hey well these
cats they have the lowest levels of
allergies I'm like oh cool she's like so
can we get one so we're only going to
harm our kids a little bit yeah just
out so we so she's like can we get a cat
like okay it's fine it checks the boxes
the kids are no longer allergic my wife
is been a good trooper I don't have kids
that are 6 months old anymore my kids

[34:02]
that are 6 months old anymore my kids
want a pet I think a dog would be better
cuz I have four boys and there's no way
like the boys are going to sit there and
be like come sit on my lap
Pho like no my kids are gonna freaking
chase them around the house because
they're they're
Hooligans so we're get she takes them up
to Grass Valley or wherever this place
is to see the cats just to make sure
that there's no allergic reactions she's
been up there three times it's an hour
drive each way she loves the cats she's
got a a cat picked out she calls me on
the way home from Capitol Camp two days
ago and it's
like what would you think of two
cats I'm like I think they'd be twice as
annoying I don't know what you want me
to say well if you think about it they
play with each other they wouldn't bug
us as much see if she were smart she
would have asked you right then how much
Capital camp
cost she didn't
know turns out these cats cost
$5,000 a piece but we got a discount so

[35:02]
$5,000 a piece but we got a discount so
instead of paying 10,000 we paid $9,500
oh that's a deal if you do the ma that's
like that's a 50% discount rate did I do
that it is actually it 55 55% D I come
home I've already got a litter box in my
freaking bathroom it's cat food I'm
already pissed I'm just freaking I'm
irritated as heck but my kids do love it
and I'm going to be 100% with You Chris
I haven't seen my wife this happen in
years wow well she's been married to you
for 16 right I know corelation
there in this case correlation does
equal
causation I got a quick animal story for
you too if you don't mind oh you're an
animal I wasn't plan on telling you this
but it only happened two hours ago so
it's relevant okay okay we go to the
library right before this podcast whole
family my kids read a lot of books so I
send the kids in to go get their books
so I can eat my Chick-fil-A in the van
right yeah sure of course they wanted to
bring the dog just a ride in the car

[36:00]
bring the dog just a ride in the car
with them oh God and so I'm getting into
my my my salad and they open the the the
van door and the dog Sprints out we're
in front of the library where this nice
indian family is walking out I don't
know why I needed another race but sure
that's
fine yeah that's a good
point edit that out Muhammad anyway so
my dog is very nice he's not mean at all
he's a golden doodle he looks nice he's
not like a do right but some kids are
afraid of dogs yeah I I was for years
okay yeah me too okay yeah and
so my dog has this thing where if you
sprint he thinks you're playing a game
and he'll chase you like and so this kid
probably 12 or 13 carrying an armful of
books no clearly terrified of dogs and
so I'm not exaggerating it was like I
was watching a skit because these books
go flying like he somehow threw them up
and there were White Pages everywhere

[37:00]
and there were White Pages everywhere
all over the grass and my dog is
sprinting after him and this kid isn't
just running he is screaming like bloody
murder oh my gosh and my dog is like oh
this is awesome he wants to play he
wants to play like this kid is convinced
if my dog catches him he's going to die
when my dog just wants to lick him and
so I feel terrible so I'm like trying to
get him my wife gets out we're all like
trying to Corner him and he's oh
everyone's playing this game and his
family was laughing at him which made it
feel better okay that was better yeah it
but and I was just apologizing I'm so
sorry I'm so sorry and then I was very
kind to victim shame him by saying stop
running he's only chasing you because
you're running so you just need to stop
running and I thought that's much akin
to telling a drowning person to stop
panicking and just swim yeah right I
realized that after and he did not in
fact stop running
then it only ended in one way and my dog

[38:01]
then it only ended in one way and my dog
was just like I'm going to add insult to
injury and he just squatt your dog no he
just took a big old dump right in front
of the
door and so we grabbed his collar as he
was pooping and so oh my gosh dude
that's it oh my gosh that's my dog story
and you're like and in the in like the
chaos of it all my wife somehow ate my
Chick-fil-A it was just so crazy that'd
be a problem it be a problem I
know good day it was a good one Chris
it's good to see you I have to tell you
something else in our last episode you
got really weird at the end and you said
oh Chris I love you so much I think
about you at night you can see our
retention drop off a cliff right as you
start that so no more weird stuff it
like 4 seconds away from an ending more
weird stuff it was longer than that okay
I know how long 4 seconds is okay
also I got to give a quick shout out to

[39:00]
