all right today we are diving into one of the
most controversial questions in entrepreneurship
should you quit your job to start a business
and I'm going to tell you something that might
surprise you sometimes the answer is heck no
and sometimes well sometimes those boats get
burned for you whether you like it or not and
here's what I mean i've had my boats burned for
me sometimes by choice and sometimes by
force i've watched friends make the leap
and crush it and I've watched other friends
destroy their families chasing a dream that
should have just stayed a side hustle so by
the end of this episode you're going to know
exactly when to take the leap and when to keep
your day job first I'm going to tell you about
the great boat burning debate that's been
messing with my head for the last 15 years
all right let's start with the elephant in the
room there are two competing viewpoints in my
head i'm a walking contradiction on one hand when
there's no plan B plan A has to work so burn the
boats go all in force yourself into a corner where
success is the only option and the second idea is

[01:00]
it is foolish to put all your eggs into one basket
smart people always have backup plans only idiots
risk everything on an unproven idea so which one
of these viewpoints is right well here's the thing
that actually drives me crazy i kind of believe
both of these things are true at the same time and
before you think I'm some wishy-washy fence sitter
let me explain my logic for you if you've never
heard of Dude Perfect there are these guys who
became YouTube millionaires by making trick shots
i'm sure you've heard of them basketball from a
helicopter golf balls into moving cars that kind
of stuff they have this incredible documentary on
YouTube i highly suggest you watch it with your
family and there's this moment in the documentary
that perfectly encapsulates burning the boats done
right so Dude Perfect started as five buddies down
at Texas A&M they started making trickshot videos
they started going viral they started getting
sponsors but it still wasn't like a business
that could support all five of their families
so three of them went on to get full-time jobs
after college and two of them the twin brothers
were working on Dude Perfect full-time and it
wasn't working they were working remotely pulling
all-nighters working on the weekends only and the

[02:04]
two brothers were kind of feeling burned out and
they were feeling slighted because they were doing
most of the work and they were about to break
up they almost quit Dude Perfect entirely their
families thought they were crazy etc etc until one
day they sat down they had a pivotal conversation
and they said "We can't just be lukewarm we got
to be all in or all out do we want to quit this
no there's something here can this support our
families right now absolutely not but we need
to have faith and belief that it will that it can
especially if we put all of our focus into it so
the three guys that had full-time jobs quit their
jobs and all five went all in on Dude Perfect and
they say specifically that that was the biggest
inflection point they'd ever experienced after
that point everything just came together bigger
and bigger sponsors better videos more virality
more money it was a runaway success and it's not a
coincidence that it happened right when they went
allin they had no backup plan it had to work they
cared about it more than they ever cared about

[03:01]
it because of that inflection point that's what
burning the boats looks like when it works plan
A becomes the only plan so plan A has to succeed i
took an entrepreneurship class in college and our
professor taught us about what's called the wing
walkers code now if you can picture a wing walker
he's walking across the wings of an airplane
and he never lets go of one railing until he
has hold of the other which also means don't burn
the boats don't let go of the main thing until you
have another thing and I also believe in that too
it just depends it depends on who you are depends
on the situation how much experience do you have
in the field are you able to go back to your job
if your business doesn't work out some people are
some people aren't how competitive is the market
that you're in both of these viewpoints feel right
to me both feel smart it just depends on you it
depends on understanding the difference between
burning the boats by choice and having them burned
for you and I've experienced both so picture
this i'm 25 years old i just sold my first real
business called Phone Restore i'm feeling pretty
good about myself and I've told the story before

[04:00]
so I'm going to make it really quick long story
short the deal with a buyer did not go as well as
it was supposed to have gone and it got a little
ugly got a little contentious my income went to
zero overnight literally unexpectedly by no fault
of my own luckily I was working on something else
of course I was i'm always working on something
else but I had to make that work and I had such
a chip on my shoulder from this deal that was
quickly going south that that further added fuel
to the fire and that next business was how I made
my first million it's how I built this house that
I'm living in today and had that deal not gone
south who knows where I'd be today i don't think I
would have had as much drive and since that moment
I've had a couple other burn your boats moments
and they've worked out just as well if not better
and conversely whenever I have a really profitable
business and I'm still tinkering with other ideas
those other ideas just don't go as well because as
soon as I hit some roadblocks or friction or I get
annoyed with customer acquisition then I just move
on to something else because I'm able to i have
that luxury i had this company called Presto Cars
once and it was a concierge car buying service and
it was working great but I hated it so I quit it

[05:04]
it could have been a big big business but my main
business was crushing it and making a lot of money
so I just didn't have the drive so a lot of this
also depends on you what type of person are you
but me when there's no other choice I have to
make it work here's another personal story for
you so as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints I've never tasted alcohol or
drugs or any of that so when I go to networking
events and someone offers me a beer or something
the temptation to drink that beer is exactly zero
0.0% because as a kid I made up my mind I am never
going to touch that and I never have and I never
will and it's easy to say no because it's not even
an option like I would not go to Walmart right now
and key all the cars in the parking lot that's not
a temptation it's not even an option it will never
happen for me now fast forward to when I'm 31
years old i look in the mirror and see how fat I'd
gotten in my 20s i was 260 lbs and I knew I had to
make a change i had to lay off the carbs but most
people fail at diets and I was no exception i had

[06:02]
tried diets in my 20s i heard about keto i tried
it and there was one secret hack that worked for
me and I just treated carbs like alcohol that's
it just as if there were alcohol sitting on the
table there was no chance I was going to drink
it if there were carbs on the table while I was
on keto it just wasn't an option i just convinced
my brain that it was alcohol or that it was keying
all the cars in the Walmart parking lot it wasn't
an option once I flipped the switch in my brain
eating carbs wasn't even a temptation anymore and
I lost 60 lbs and I kept it off that's a burn the
boats moment right there it's not like anyone took
carbs from me and it wasn't an option i made that
choice strategically now don't misunderstand i'm
not saying that if you suffer from any addiction
you can just will yourself to stop i know it's
a lot more complex and more difficult than that
but for me in this specific circumstance it
worked great quick question what if there were
a private community out there of people that were
building businesses based on this podcast well I

[07:00]
just made it and it's only for business starters
and business builders it's called TK owners and
it's basically like having me and a hundred other

your burn the boats moment doesn't have to be
quitting your job it can be smaller more targeted
decisions where you simply eliminate the option to
go back but here's the thing that's going to
make you a little mad when people come to me

[08:02]
with their business ideas and ask if they should
quit their six-figure jobs I almost always tell
them no and they're coming to me hoping that
I say yes they want me to be the guy that says
"Go for it chase your dreams burn the boats." But
the thought of me encouraging someone to do that
scares me to death i've never had to quit a big
awesome job so I really have a hard time advising
someone else to do that especially when they have
a family especially if they might turn out to be a
crap business owner i don't know so there's a key
distinction here that everyone is missing burning
the boats is not taking a poorly calculated risk
if burning the boats is done right it should feel
like an obvious decision and you're going to
hear that in the conversation we'll get to in
a minute it should feel like the only decision
i'm used to someone else lighting the match when
my boats were burnt that's not normal sometimes
that fire arrow comes out from behind the ridge
and lands right on my stern and there's nothing
I can do about it except figure out how to swim
so here's the million-dollar question how do
you get all the benefits of burning the boats
without the stupidity of taking massive poorly
calculated risks so let me paint you a picture

[09:04]
meet John john makes 180 grand a year working at
a corporate job john wants to open a mini donut
stand not just one stand he's allin he wants to
create a franchiseable model that he can scale
nationwide so John comes to me and says "Chris
should I quit my job and chase this dream?" And
here's my answer that makes everyone mad no John
you shouldn't but here's what you should do we can
be creative because constraints equal creativity
so do this John burn the boats by committing to a
plan a smart plan and here's exactly how it'll
work day one John sets revenue goals within a
reasonable time frame if these goals are hit he
quits his job if they're not he stays the boats
are burned on the commitment of the plan not on
the paycheck months one through three John spends
nights and weekends learning everything about
the mini donut business he's not playing around
he's treating this like his life depends on
it because eventually he will he wants it to
months four and five John finds and buys a mini
doughnut cart on eBay he's not going to finance

[10:03]
200 grand for a storefront he's starting smart
and small month six John learns how to operate
everything in his spare time he's making donuts
in his garage he's perfecting recipes he still
hasn't quit his job he's figuring out how to work
the equipment how to repair it month seven Jon
spends every single weekend at fairs festivals
and farmers markets slanging donuts and learning
the ropes this is where the magic happens this
is where Jon finds out if he's cut out for this
or not month nine if the numbers are working Jon
buys a second cart and hires his first employee
remember he still hasn't quit his job and if
for whatever reason this business doesn't work
out he has learned a valuable lesson for only a
few thousand dollars and not having to quit his
job instead of hundreds of thousands of dollars
and quitting his job do you see what's happening
here john is burning boats on the commitment level
while keeping his financial safety nets in place
he's eliminated the option to be casual about this
business he's eliminated the option to quit when

[11:00]
it gets hard but he hasn't eliminated his dream
or his ability to feed his family this is how you
burn boats intelligently and strategically you
remove the ability to be half-hearted without
removing your ability to survive and here's the
thing most people aren't going to do this you know
why cuz it's actually harder than just quitting
your job when you quit your job you get this rush
this dopamine hit you get to tell everyone you're
an entrepreneur now you get to feel like you're
living the dream but when you do it the smart way
you're working 60 hours a week it's not sexy 40 at
your day job 20 plus on your side business you're
grinding in the evenings and on the weekends while
your friends are watching Netflix and there's
no glory in it and yes you care about what
people say because everyone does you don't have a
dramatic story to tell at parties it's just smart
methodical progress towards a goal but here's
what happens when you do it this way by the time
you actually quit your job it doesn't feel like
burning boats at all it feels like the obvious
next step because you've already proven out
the concept you've already built the foundation

[12:03]
the boats don't get burned they get upgraded to
a yacht i try to read and respond to every single
response to my newsletter and here's what I've
learned about most of you listening right now
you either own a business or real estate or you
want to both categories will always need a burn
the boats moment eventually maybe it's to open
location number two maybe it's to quit your job
and go full-time and maybe it's to make that
acquisition you've been thinking of for months
and here's something I've noticed in thousands
of conversations with these entrepreneurs i
can't remember ever talking to someone about a
major trial they faced without them telling me
something like "But man did things get so much
better afterwards." There's a pattern there the
struggle isn't the end of the story it's the
setup for the comeback many of you listening
or watching right now are probably going through
some serious suck i don't know what that is maybe
your business is struggling maybe your marriage
is struggling maybe you're stuck in a dead-end
job that you hate maybe you're drowning in debt or
dealing with family issues or health problems but

[13:01]
I don't know your situation but I do know this
your greatest days are ahead of you and we will
always learn the reason for our trials maybe in
this life maybe in the next but what I've learned
about burning boats whether by choice or by force
is if you burn the boats and run out of coconuts
you're about to find a herd of cattle in a spring
not what you expected but maybe even better if you
burn the boats and you get desperately homesick
you're about to be rescued if you burn the boats
and you feel hopelessly foolish you're about to be
vindicated now I'm not going to give you a cliche
like what doesn't kill us makes us stronger but
I will say and this is a CK original what doesn't
kill us reveals the strength that we've already
had all along so you can do this whether you burn
the boats keep a plan B do both the choice is
yours but now at least you know the difference
all right I hope I inspired or encouraged
you today to do what you think you should do
