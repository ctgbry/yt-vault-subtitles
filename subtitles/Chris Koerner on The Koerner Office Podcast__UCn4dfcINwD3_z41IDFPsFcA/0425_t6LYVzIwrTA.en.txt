look at this freaking thing right here
an aquarium for cats who would have
thought these guys are selling millions
of dollars of these every year here's
why it's awesome and how you can copy it
it's awesome because it takes an item
that's very visually appealing aquariums
it's Dynamic everything's always moving
which is why people love to have them or
look at them and then it takes something
that's basically woried as if it's its
own religion and that's cats cats go
viral cats are polarizing cats are
beloved put that together with something
that's visually appealing and already
beloved instant viral hit so am I saying
you should make money by selling your
own aquarium for cats no not really I
don't really like that business in and
of itself I just like the frame work
that it represents it's like fertilizer
for more business ideas so what other
product or service that's universally
beloved visually appealing very Dynamic
could you marry together with cats and
sell on your own I have some ideas right
here
