we just went under contract on my dream
RV park just outside of Glacier National
Park in Montana here's why I love this
park and why it's going to be a great
investment there's very limited Supply
in the area we compete with very few
other RV parks it has paved roads and
City Utilities it's 4 minutes from the
park entrance it has a dog park and EV
charging it's on 22 Acres there's room
to expand you've got 62 pad sites four
glamping sites and four cabins it has a
playground sport courts ebike rentals
and all that one of the cons is it has a
gift shop and a restaurant which is kind
of complex it's shut down for half the
year due to winter weather but at the
end of the day this is going to be a
great investment for us and our
investors and I look forward to being a
part of it
