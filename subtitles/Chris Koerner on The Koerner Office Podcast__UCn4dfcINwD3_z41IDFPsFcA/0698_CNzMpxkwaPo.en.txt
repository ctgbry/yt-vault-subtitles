[00:00]
people don't realize like they think AI
agents all this like pipe dream this thing
that's going to happen at some point in the
future I'm like no no no it's happening right
now I've been saying that but here it is
People have success with this Like we've
got one in particular He's starting to
generate like $10,000 a month with his
Lindy agency It doesn't take a lot Just
go to lindy.ai/templates and we have like
hundreds of templates here I do believe AI
agencies of the future because most people
they either don't know how to set up these
AI agents or even if they know they don't
have the time to If someone were to launch an
agency what industry would you attack first
Wow Okay my brain is buzzing I just finished an
interview with Flo He's the owner of Lindy Lindy
is basically the AI first Zapier of the future
and I'm a user and a fan and I wanted to find
out how can we use Lindy to make money or to save
money or to save time Very granularly actionably
he shared a screen My mind is blown That's
period I'm not hyping this up AI agents are here
I thought they were just here in theory and it
was just a cool talking point and it was an easy

[01:00]
way to raise a bunch of money for something that
wasn't ready yet But they're here Agents are here
and this was incredible So you're going to love
it Share with a friend and enjoy Well why don't
you just give us a high level overview of what
Lindy is and what problem it solves Yeah we are
a no code platform that lets you build AI agents
What it solves is that well AI agents work for you
They're like AI employees So it's uh it's just the
same sort of problem that like a human employee
would solve for you except it's way cheaper way
faster It works 24/7 It doesn't go on strike I
know I'm French but we we haven't implemented the
strike feature yet People use AI agents to I mean
save time save money make money You automate your
customer support you automate your lead generation
your lead outreach and and so forth Where would
you draw the line between an AI automation and
an AI agent How do you differentiate between them
Personally an AI agent is powered throughout by
an LLM which is at every point aware You know the
Camela Harris quotes It's like you know everything

[02:02]
that comes before you and the context in which
you exist and what that's AI agents versus AI
automation It's like they understand everything
that just happens They have this memory and it's
both shortterm and sometimes long-term memory They
understand their history and they learn over time
So for example an AI agent can engage in a
conversation with someone right Because it
understands everything that was just said And so
if you add a message to the conversation it knows
what it means because it sees the rest of the
conversation An AI automation is more like each
step is an island And if you want some context
to bleed over from one step to the next you
need to build that in right Not all the context
automatically bleeds over So like an AI automation
is really useful for like really simple like ABC
like once and done things like hey a new lead
comes in you research him you qualify him you send
him an email like that's an AI automation an AI
agent is like for more advanced use cases any any
use case where you're going to have a conversation

[03:00]
with human requires an AI agent and any use case
where you're less than 100% sure of what should
happen next at any given point should have an
AI agent because the AI agent decide what to do
So like an agent needs to be more open-ended
right More variables It can be more open-ended
Exactly Yes Okay Maybe this is a good example I
I'm running Facebook ads right now for a pickle
ball club that I'm launching It's just like a
side project And I have a Zapier automation set
up to take my Facebook leads and put them in a
Google sheet Super dead simple But then people
also fill out a type form where I get their phone
number and I'd like to call them and get feedback
on what they think about this club An agent might
take it a step further give them a call using 11
Labs or Synthflow or any of those other things
that you probably integrate with and say "Hey
how much would you pay for this When do you want
to be What's your shirt size?" Because founding
members get a t-shirt Like it would go 10 extra
steps for me 100% And like phone calls is like an

[04:01]
excellent example It's one of the top use cases
for AI agents and and for us like we do support
phone calls I know you like to keep it tactical so
like I'm happy to do like a demo later on of of a
phone call using Lindy but it's impressive It's
kind of surreal to like it hits different once
you hear the voice of the agent and you're able
to talk to it on the phone What would you say like
80% of your users are using Lindy for What type of
tasks It's like three big categories of use cases
Number one is sales So it's like lead generation
lead enrichment lead qualification lead outreach
like you can have an AI agent like personalize
its lead outreach at scale like really fast really
affordably Number two is customer support and
because we have like thousands of integrations
and so you can get your AI agent to basically
entirely automate your customer support over
any channel like SMS email intercom zenes freshes
WhatsApp phone like you name it can it can do it
And then the the third really big one is and it's
sort of a universal one really is like personal

[05:01]
assistance So anything email related or meeting
related So like I have Lindy schedule my meetings
for me by email I have Lindy prepare me for my
meetings I have a phone Lindy that I call It's
like "Yo what's on my calendar today Can you help
me clean it up?" I have Lindy record my meetings
and take notes And email you know like Lindy
drafts my email triages my inbox She sends me a
text messages or gives me a call if I have like a
really timesensitive email that they need to take
attention to that kind of stuff So you will get a
call from AI saying "Flo dude check this email The
pipe just exploded in your rental house We've got
to get someone over there." Yeah Hopefully that
doesn't happen too often but yes like I would say
once or twice a week I receive a phone call from a
Lindy that's like "Flo you really want to take
a look at this right now?" And you know about
once a day or so I receive a text message from
Lindy that's like "Flo you received an email from
Bob asking about this urgent thing." And I can
actually email message back and forth with Lindy
I can be like "Oh snap I'm in a meeting Like tell
him I'll be right back." and she just like sends
the email Wow So she'll move that message over
to Bob Well it's cooler than just moving it over

[06:04]
because it's not just like a copy paste of like
I have to like type my email I can literally just
be like tell him I'll be right back And she's
going to draft an email saying that Wow Okay
I thought I was using Lindy a lot but I haven't
even scratched the surface I haven't scratched it
either I made the dumb thing and it's like every
day it surprises me in what it can do Yeah I think
it's interesting that you said sales first because
like everything I've noticed about business and
all these SAS products is like it needs to be
able to tie to generating revenue Like that is the
easiest lowest hanging fruit use case to anything
Like if I know that this X dollars per month that
I spend on this tool can return Y dollars per
month then I'm going to be your first customer Is
that kind of what you're seeing Yeah Yeah I mean
that's obviously like the fastest way to ramp up
your revenue is to offer other people to ramp up
their revenue And in a way it's a no-brainer all
because I don't know about you like the first time
I heard about the job of an SDR I was like why is

[07:02]
it a human doing this This is insane that like
we need we need a person doing this So yeah all
of these jobs are being augmented at the very
least and and automated actually quite rapidly
Hm Now what are like the the the 20% use cases
that are really interesting but less common for
Lindy Well seeing quite a bit of of marketing as
well like people automating automating content
creation using Lindy I need to coin a term for
this It's like basically reports like AI generated
reports because AI is really good obviously at
ingesting a ton of content like you could upload
upload like a 200 pages long PDF to CLT and ask
for a summary and it's basically reading the 200
pages book in like two seconds or something And
so some of my favorite agents we have an agent
that sits at what I call the boundary between the
company and the outside of the company So every
customerf facing interaction we have that agencies
So every ticket every email every meeting that we

[08:04]
have with with a customer or with a prospect like
that agent sees and then at at the end of of the
day it sends a a message and it actually sends it
to the entire company It sends it on Slack So in
the general channel on Slack sends a message like
hey this is what's happening today at the boundary
of the company And then you can engage in like
an interactive Q&A like back and forth with it
on Slack you be like "Oh wait There's this like
bullet point in here where you're like Bob was
really unhappy with XYZ You could tell me more
about this and and he'll reply to you." I love
that And we're seeing more and more use cases of
that Like I think people underestimate the extent
to which companies are basically blackboxes Like
you don't really know everything that's going on
in your business Agents are already turning on
the light for for a lot of businesses Yeah I
mean I could even see it like let's say I'm the
CFO for a publicly traded company and I see that
Slack update the summary come in What's happening
in the boundaries of the company and it's like hey
Bob the the customer Bob had a complaint about X
Y or Z product and I see that as an executive and

[09:02]
I say why is that even launched we launched that
product like that was like they're probably seeing
like major things that's like holy crap like 30
people in the company knew about this but no one
thought to tell me you know until this automation
another thing that I 100% sometimes it flags oh
customer X was really frustrated with or sales
rep during the call and I'm like oh and it's like
can you send me the meeting recording please and
like yeah right here it changes the whole company
because again it's like all of your walls are
transparent Everything sees every everyone sees
everything and as a result like learnings spread
a lot faster as well right you can be like ah look
like this customer got really frustrated it's the
moment we said this so let's not say this anymore
you see that it's like customer got very upset
at our employee John well I want to listen to
this so you listen to this and you learn that
John just said what our pricing was in a very
nice way and they were just an irrational customer
can you type back to it and say hey I don't really

[10:00]
want to see stuff like this anymore because that's
just an irrational professional customer can you
like train it as you go 100% And so your question
earlier about like AI agents versus AI automations
Agents learn continuously So you could literally
just tell it that in natural language like "Hey
don't tell me about this moving forward." And it's
going to remember it It's going to like keep it in
mind moving forward I do that with I have like
an email triage agent that just triages my inbox
every day And I just have like three buckets I
have urgent I have FYI and I have archive And when
I see an email make it in the wrong section I just
like forward it to my email triage agent Like my
email triage agent has its own email address And
so I just forward these emails I'm like hey this
email does not belong in a like this kind of email
belongs in in FYI And I can just give it arbitrary
rules I could be like hey emails about this topic
or emails about recruiting or whatever Just just
do this moving forward Now are you still at the
mercy of whatever LLM you're using on the back
end Because like Chad GBT it's like stop using m
dashes seriously stop using emojis seriously and

[11:02]
it doesn't right so are you still at the mercy of
that you are at the end of the day it is powered
by an LLM I will say though are you using GPT 40
40 and 30 it depends I always recommend people
not to use 40 it's it's a really bad model
frankly like it's fine for like day-to-day
conversation like to power workflows it's not good
we default to cloud full soet which is excellent
and we also offer CL 3.5 set which is one of my
favorite models So yes at the end of the day it
is powered by an LLM but like LLMs are getting
really good Yeah I said three I meant 03 and I'm
using Claude Sonet 4.0 for writing a lot and it
is really really good It's so good Yeah With a
great context window Speaking of context windows
is Lindy also at the at the mercy of the LLM's
context window Like technically how does that work
Yes Every agent is just an LLM at the bottom right
So yes at the end of the day we are subject to
the same context window limits as the LLM offers

[12:00]
I will say though like modern context windows are
huge Like they go up to like one or two million
tokens That's like I think a sequence of like a
thousand pages book It's it's very rare that we
hit context window limits anymore And even when
we hit them what we do is that we just compress
the context window We jam as much more efficient
That's right And it works really well like you
you basically context windows are for all intents
and purposes they're basically getting infinite
It's been a few months since I've looked for this
solution but I I just want something to read all
of my emails like through the past and to be able
to just learn so I could train I could pass it on
to an employee for customer support requests Is
there a clean way of doing that today or are there
too many privacy concerns that prevent that There
is a way to sort of hack it together for example
So like the way you would hack it on Lindy is
you would export your inbox in Gmail There's like
an option to export every email you've sent or
received and probably sent is the most important

[13:00]
one And then you would upload that to Lindy as a
knowledge base And then you would ask Lindy to use
that information to draft your emails or respond
moving forward for you or whatnot Okay But like
me I've got a holding company and we have eight
different businesses and they all a lot of stuff
just funnels to my main inbox How would you be
able to sort that out Like if this business then
respond this way you know whereas if if I was like
the customer support lead for one business it'd be
very straightforward It's like here's how I answer
all the random questions you know Yeah So you can
set up branching in agents including in mind
So you could just have like have a a condition
like a branching node is what we call it and then
you could be like hey if this business go here if
that business go there and then each of these
branches would lead to a different knowledge
base Can you use Lindy to to shrink the context
window down because that's something that I might
actually butt up against the context window How
would that work Well you wouldn't but up against
the context window for this use case because
the point of the knowledge base is that it's
got it's got a huge corpus of knowledge sometimes
like trillions of tokens but then it's using rag

[14:05]
like a retrieval augmented generation So it's it's
basically searching it's like the equivalent of a
Google search for this huge corpus of knowledge So
then it actually context then injects into the LLM
and the agents context window is actually quite
limited It's just a couple thousand tokens So you
you probably wouldn't run into the limit That
said if you do run into the limit yes we also
have a step that you can inject in your agent
that's like when you reach this point compress
the context window And you can pass it a prompt
that's like compress the the context window and
before you do that extract X Y and Z information
Gotcha Okay cool Has there ever been an automation
that it was just kind of like a this is so crazy
that it worked Like I can't believe this actually
worked And what was that moment or automation
like Yes I would say there's two categories
of automations where we're like I can't believe
this works There's one where we're like I can't
believe this works just because the user set it
up in such a crazy way an inefficient way Yeah

[15:04]
you could call it that It's like very often they
just have like one giant AI agent step with like
a huge prompt and like 50 actions in that prompt
It's like oh my god And it works And the prompt
doesn't even really make sense When I read it as
a human I can barely understand what the person
is saying And somehow the agent is figuring it out
I'm like how does this work Again I think that's
the strength of AI agents is that they are really
forgiving like automations and coding in general
Like you just get one little thing wrong and the
whole thing collapses and stops working AI agents
they limp along like you could you can remove
characters you can remove entire lines like the AI
agent is always going to try to figure it out And
then there's the second category where we're like
we can't believe it works just because the use
case is so complex It's not as much like the user
screwed up Like the user did a good job It's just
like "Oh my god this is an insane use case." Like
I think some of my favorite AI agents are like
sales and like SDR AI agents So we have this one
that engages with a lead on a web chat interface
and it collects information It qualifies the lead

[16:04]
and then if the lead wants a meeting the agent
books the meeting So it looks at the calendars of
of the company It like books the meeting It sends
a confirmation email It sends a confirmation text
It calls the person on the phone before the
meeting to confirm some information after the
meeting So it it records the meeting It joins the
meeting as well as as the sales rep takes notes
and after the meeting it sends a follow-up to be
like "Hey thank you for your time This is what we
discussed." And the whole time it keeps in context
all the previous interactions that it had over
all these modities So like the web chats the SMS
the phone call all that stuff So like if it calls
you on the phone and it's emailed back and forth
with you before it will mention that on the phone
be like "Hey Bob like we've just emailed we talked
about this like do you how's your day going?" So
seeing exactly like holy like that's when I was
like "It's getting real." Like it's it's happening
you know Oh man In that case is it telling
the user I'm AI You can't miss it It's not at
a point yet Well like you would be confused by it
Especially when you have it on the phone you know

[17:02]
it's an AI The way that users set it up is like
yes it is obvious that it's an AI Also because
like on the web chat it just replies too fast and
all of that stuff It's actually funny We have some
customers pretty frequently actually They ask us
can we make the agent slower It's like too fast
It's like a human Yeah Yeah Yeah But yeah in this
in this case you can tell it's an AI I mean I've
been setting up like email automations for a while
We're like if someone emails me this with these
keywords respond with that And very few platforms
allow me to put a pause in there Kind of like
Zapier you can put a pause in between something
And I think that's a big part of it because if if
I send someone a critical email and I get back
four paragraphs within 10 seconds I'm going to
[ __ ] my head as I look at that you know like h
okay I'm going to discount this email Whereas if
it takes a half hour to get it but that's I'm
sure that's like super easy with Lindy Yeah
100% Yeah Just like ZPO you can introduce like a
waiting step Yeah Yeah I'll give you an example of
something that happened actually just a couple of
weeks ago I have Lindy scheduled my meetings So if

[18:01]
someone sends me an email and it's like Flo let's
meet and I do want to meet I CC my Lindy assistant
to my email I'm like "Oh sounds good Lindy will
help us find times." But then she goes back and
forth She looks at my calendar She agrees on the
time with the other party She sends the calendar
invite And then a couple of weeks ago there is
this person I was supposed to meet with on that
day actually And last minute she sends an email in
the thread and she's like "Flo I'm sorry I have to
cancel today's meeting My son just had an accident
I have to go to the hospital." And Lindy sees the
email is on the email thread and she's like I'm
so sorry to hear about your sub which by the way
like again that speaks to your point about the AI
agent because she's seen the entire conversation
and automation here would have sort of worked but
it would have been dumb It's like "Oh okay Branch
rescheduled requested." It's like "Here are some
more times for." So like here it's like "Yep I'm
so sorry to hear about your son." And she did not
even offer times immediately She like "Take your
time I'll circle back to you later." You know Wow
And then she waited and she woke up like I think
five days later or something And she's like "Hey
how's your son doing Is everything okay Is now

[19:01]
a good time to put some time on the books again?"
Oh my gosh I know I And that's what I mean I like
Did you set it up to do that No And that's what I
mean like I built the platform but I'm surprised
every day by what it does I can't even talk right
now I'm just thinking like I can set up a zap that
does that and it's like my son just got hit by a
car I have to transfer or I have to push and it's
like what date works for you That just looks
so bad That just I cringe even talking about
the hypothetical And this happens every day Like
just the other day someone else added his human
assistant to the thread to schedule time And the
email assistant was like "Haha you're adding your
AI assistant Like am I getting replaced anytime
soon?" And Lindy replied she was like "Haha like
I don't think I'm replacing anyone anytime soon."
Smiley face I was like that's just that's like
smooth and cool you know Right Right So with like
the the SDR the sales example are there companies

[20:00]
like it just seems like we're still so early that
a lot of the sales stuff is like a party trick
Like there's a dozen companies in Silicon Valley
that have raised tens of millions of dollars for
sales agents right That's it Do you have customers
that are like wholly relying on sales agents to
actually bring money in the door like end to
end Yeah absolutely Well not end to end Like
you still need like a human to close them That's
for sure For now For now Yeah I think it'll take
a while to replace that Be it only because humans
don't build relation I think sales is truly about
relationships Humans have like an anti- AAI bias
Humans don't build relationships with AIS They
build relationships with humans So I think like
that reason alone I think humans are going to be
in the sales loop for a very long time unless we
reach a point where the AI is indistinguishable
from human even on a zoom call and we reach a
point where people are comfortable misleading
their customers and not telling them it's an AI
but I think we're pretty far away from that and

[21:01]
I think be be messed up to do this but um yeah
yeah we do have some customers who basically
like all they have is AI SDLs like they don't
have human SDLs anymore Yeah the example that
you gave a few minutes ago of the SDR agent that
that does everything and it follows up is the
call that it's booking that's still with an actual
human then right But the AI agent will follow up
We remind them it will do everything else That's
right Including sending a prep email to the human
right They'll be like "Hey you have a meeting
with Bob This is what we discussed previously
This is what you need to know." Do you guys have
any integrations with ringless voicemail services
You know what that is called ringless voicemail
drops where there's a company that makes sense
like Sly Broadcast does it because like if I'm an
SDR agent or if I if I'm a sales manager I would
want to clone my sales agent's voice with 11 Labs
and then send the like a summary of the call but I
don't want it to actually answer the human And so
I would use something like Slide Broadcast to just

[22:03]
drop a voicemail with the sales agent's voice
so they they think it's him and just say "Hey
thanks for the call just want to follow up These
are my action items These are yours Hope you have
a great weekend And they're just going to assume
they they missed the call Oh voiceless voicemail
Ringless voicemail drops Ringless voicemail I'll
I'll look it up That should be something pretty
straightforward to integrate with Yeah So you
obviously need a person to like collect the wire
info and hop on the sales calls and warm them up
and have the relationship What types of industries
do you think that using sales agents it works the
best in today Because like if I'm selling like
copper pipe fittings B2B probably not great but
if I'm selling like enterprise SAS could be great
What are you seeing works really well for sales
specifically What industries or price points Yeah
I had the same priorities you like pipe feeding
not a fit enterprise as a fit and I actually
think it's the opposite I think pipe feeding is a
great fit and the reason for that is because the

[23:02]
people you sell pipe feeding to are not really
techsavvy like they don't want to jump on a zoom
call they're sort of like on the go the all day So
like if you if your prospect is on the go all day
you should you should probably use one of these
voice agents If your prospect does not like is not
techsavvy you should probably use a voice agent We
actually even have people deploying voice agents
for like their own reps who are like field reps
like so like they're they're on the field all day
They're like in their car and they've deployed AI
agents to help these reps update their CRM on the
go just by making a phone call So anytime your
your prospect is on the go or anytime if you're
very busy and you can't pick up the phone So we
actually have like some blue collar workers like
plumbers We have some restaurants as well because
restaurants they're busy at big hours You know
you see them they like run around and stuff and
that's also the time when they receive the most
phone calls So we actually have some restaurants
using us as like an AI phone receptionist because
it's always the same question It's like are you
open tonight Are you serving XY and Z and and

[24:00]
the food reception like make reservations and
so forth and then like the plumbumber use case
is different It's more like this guy is plumbing
It's not it's not like like picking up the phone
and every phone call he's missing his business
is missing So I would say those are like the
big use cases where where like AI voice agents
are really effective Yeah I think there are some
use cases where there's you almost do more harm
than good disclosing that it's AI Like if I'm
calling a restaurant to find out do you have any
tables right now Can I make a reservation a week
from now are you open Do you know can I get a
gluten-free pizza Like as a customer I'm cool
with that being very transactional I would rather
talk to a robot whether I know it's one or not
than like sit on hold or leave a voicemail and I
know I'm never going to get called back Whereas
in like the SDR example something higher ticket
or more personalized because I'm not building a
relationship with a hostess at a restaurant
I probably want to say as I answer the phone
like "Hey I'm an AI agent but I can I'm actually
a lot more capable How can I help you?" Yeah And
you know some people at least at first do they
dislike talking to an AI agent and I think a lot

[25:01]
of that is because they've been conditioned
by like the phone trees right like type one
to continue type and that experience is just so
awful but people have just learned like I I want
to talk to a human little by little they learned
that like this is a fundamentally different breed
of product from like a phone tree of like your
parents were using you know and then they actually
also end up appreciating it because they they
appreciate that like yeah you'll never put on
You can do immediately and you can call it as much
as you want You're not afraid of of disturbing it
Like I have my Lindy I have a human assistant
as well but I I call my Lindy on the phone all
the time I actually call call it more often than I
would my human assistant But even though the human
assistant like works for me like I wouldn't feel
comfortable calling him like 20 times a day at
like 11 p.m to ask for like random stuff Yeah
I mean as a consumer I am more than ready for
companies like Verizon or these mega companies to
just completely get rid of their call centers and
replace it with AI voice agents We just switched
to Verizon Our whole family planned in my son's

[26:01]
phone For whatever reason the number would not
port over and we called support four times We
went into the store and they ended up putting
me on support while I'm in the store and it
never got fixed We ended up having to get a
new number And I was just thinking the whole
time like I am so ready to talk to a robot here
because I wouldn't have to wait It knows all the
long because I knew I know our problem was like
a very longtail obscure issue and it would know
that whereas the rep doesn't they have like four
issues that they work through and so I kept having
to be put on hold and transferred and it's the
it can't get any worse like this can only be an
upgrade you know So you can actually also use AI
agents for this I I use Lindy for this online like
I I had also an issue with my internet service
provider a couple of weeks ago and I just sent
my agent to do it She spent half an hour on the
phone with these people was Google I hate them
Awful And half an hour on the phone with them and
and in the end she resolved the issue and that's
that's half hour that I got in my weekend Wow Oh
man It's like the robots talking to people who

[27:02]
act like robots but the real robots are actually
smart Yes Yes I would love for you to show like
some interesting use cases on your screen that
could apply to like a large amount of people Yeah
absolutely Let me share my screen here And I'd
love to hear about any agencies that are building
agencies completely on top of of Lindy Maybe
it's a lead genen agency or AI automation agency
etc Yeah I'd love I'd love to talk about this as
well for sure Let me share my screen right now
This is my chief of staff in this It's sort of
like the the main Lindy I use all the time And
so you can see like just on Sunday I called
I called her four times I'm gonna call her
right now My Lindy number going to put her on
speaker Hi Flo How can I help Hey Lindy what's
on my calendar today You have an interview with
entrepreneurship and opportunities two meetings
with the marketing team and three interviews with
candidates Yeah Anything else Hi Flo How can I

[28:00]
help That's all I need The demo effect I think
it just keeps saying that But u right here No Oh
it just keeps repeating high flow How can I help
No That's only for today Jeez Louise I don't know
why I'm not doing that I'm using the chat GBT
voice feature a lot Like multiple times a day
It doesn't even hold a candle to this because it
doesn't know what's on my calendar Yeah You know
Yeah I use it for that all day I use it for like
this is the thing I mentioned where like anytime I
receive a time-sensitive email it sends me a text
message And I'll show you what it looks like in
the back end It's actually really really simple
flow editor It's like if I receive an email you
look at my calendar first because you need to know
what's on my calendar in order to to determine if
it's a timesensitive email And then there is this
condition and this is what I mean by AI agents can
see everything that that just happened before Like
here I can write a prompt for my condition and the
prompt is just like if this is a time-sensitive
email from someone asking to reschedule a meeting
I have today with them So again I don't need
to inject the context I don't need to do any

[29:01]
of that stuff It's like an AI agent that received
the email that looked at me and now it knows what
I'm talking about And if this is a timesensitive
email you send me a text message So it's like you
received an email message from name about very
very short summary And here I can just like add
this kind of and here I'm just prompting and you
can see I'm prompting in this case cloudful summit
which again is one of my favorite models ever
It's just awesome What do you love about it The
vibes are immaculate in the palance of the youth
It's it's in the bottles there you know It's uh
it's smart it's cheap it's like it's affordable
it's fast I really like its riding style Like
I really usually cringe when I see LLM writing
styles It's like you can tell it's an AI model
here Like you can barely tell anymore Yeah Okay
that's amazing It actually also sends a message to
my human assistant like sends the same text again
And again this is the difference between an agent
and an automation Like here I can be like send the
same text again because it knows the text message
just sent because of that memory but this time say
flow received not you received I use Lindy all the

[30:04]
time for like well meeting recording I use Lindy
to manage my personal CRM Every Friday for example
she wakes up she looks at my calendar she looks at
my CRM and then she recommends people to add to my
CRM She's like you met with these new people that
you don't have in your CRM I checked You don't
have them in your in your CRM yet do you want to
add them to your serum And I can just be like "Yep
add A B and C and tag them." Like C is an investor
B is a sales leader And then every so often I go
to um Lindy and I'm like hey who are for example
like we just made like a big announcement a couple
of of weeks ago and I was like hey who are the
AI influencers that I know And it just goes in
my CRM like hey these are the influencers Yeah I
use it for my daily digest So it's basically I'll
just show you the flow detail for this one Every
morning it wakes up It looks at my calendar and
then for every meeting and for every attendee of
every meeting It looks for their LinkedIn It looks

[31:01]
for my email history with this person It looks
for my meeting notes that are brought together by
a Lindy And then it brings together like one nice
email with like this is people you're meeting with
today This is the last thing you discussed during
our last meeting This is the things you discussed
over email with them and so forth I'll give
one last example and then I'll shut up because
otherwise I never stop Good I want to learn about
what you're doing with deep research as well Yeah
I have this deep research legend here Yeah Well
why don't we start with that actually So deep
research I use deep research for I really like
learning about companies and about founders and
I find that there's actually a lot of knowledge
in podcasts I actually think this and they're not
very searchable It is not very searchable until
agents Yeah And so I'll show you an example of
of how it works here So here for example I wanted
to learn about like Mark Binaf or like Zeb So Zeb
Evans is the founder of click app and so like I
just give it a name like Zeb Okay And here it is

[32:00]
searching on Google interviews with Zeb Evans Okay
And it's finding 10 results and then it's going
through all these results and simultaneously we
call this an agent's womb It's it's really good So
simultaneously it basically spins up one copy of
itself Okay Okay And it transcribes the video and
then it summarizes the video and then all these
summaries one one video at a time Well no it does
all of it at the same time Okay And then once the
summaries are done it exits the loop and then it
gives me this summary of summaries Oh man So it's
like this is everything that Zeb Evans mentioned
and I can go and ask follow-up questions I'm like
ah tell me more about XY It's an agent so I can
just I can just chat with Yeah dude You know what
would be cool is that same thing except let's say
Zeb Evans has 10 interviews 10 period total And in
each interview there's like 60 to 80% of overlap
He's kind of saying the same thing I would love an
agent that shows me all the non-overlap Oh that's
what it does That's what Oh that's what it does
Like childhood stories and Yeah Yeah Yeah So you

[33:01]
can see here for example like key scenes across
interviews Uhhuh Right So like this is an agent
that has seen the summaries of all the YouTube
videos and it's giving me its own analysis Oh
my gosh So I can I can ask actually it's like
here like um what are some of the things that
he says across the most interviews I mean for my
podcast prep this would be amazing I could have
done this with you You could have You should have
Looking across the interviews here are the themes
that he consistently repeats 1% better over the
near-death experiences six total Oh yeah Yeah
He like I get like quotes from interviews and so
forth Recording I'll show this one because that's
that's one of my favorite So I spend a lot of my
time recording Like I always joke that a founder
is basically just like a glorified recruiter We
are right now hiring By the way we are hiring Hit
me up Okay you heard it We are hiring across
every function but one one of the ones that
we're hiring for is sales leaders So here I have
this Lindy recruiter and if you look at the time

[34:06]
stamps look it's like 4:13 p.m on Tuesday right
And I'm like "Hey find me directors of SMB sales
from one of these companies." And I give it
a list of companies And she's like "All right
let me look." She's searching and she's like "I
found one candidate." And then she says "Let me
try another search." And again it's an AI agent I
I didn't need to ask it to do this It's like smart
enough to know like it's probably he's probably
not going for one candidate you know So like let
me let me search for more It's like all right I
found I found these guys here and I'm like yeah
like keep searching So it keeps searching and then
it finds it finds these people and it's like okay
like tell me which ones of those you want me to
reach out to And I'm like yeah all of them all of
them look good And it just just reaches out And so
here again it's it's kicking off an agent's womb
where it's like for each person I'll just click
in the in the subtasks here For each person first
it checks it searches my inbox to check if I've
already reached out before because sometimes I
have It's like okay you've not reached out to this
person before Since you haven't reached out let me

[35:02]
draft an email for them And boom Hey this is Flo
You know we're looking for a head of sales Would
you be interested in the conversation And all of
this I wonder if there's like another time stamp
I can look at Well yeah I can because like this
was kicked off at 4:13 And this Yeah at 4:18 the
outreach started So in five minutes it found the
people I was looking for and it sent the email
And then you can see it sent follow-up So like it
woke up again two days later and then again two
days later and just like kept sending follow-up
emails Oh my gosh I can't even like think of my
next question because I just want to log off and
just start building these That's what I mean It's
like it's real Like people don't realize like they
think AI agents all this like pipe dreams this
thing that's going to happen at some point in the
future I'm like no no no it's happening right now
I've been saying that like I tweeted a couple
months ago like everyone's talking about AI
agents who is actually using them today in their
business and how and like I just heard a bunch
of like third-hand stories of but here it is How
can the general public like I know you have like

[36:03]
a repository of do you call them flows I we call
them lindies but we're going to rename agents How
can people just copy and paste this with their own
use case Yeah you just go to lindy.ai tempmplates
and we have like hundreds of templates here I
think we have one for the recruiter actually I
just showed lead generator We should have one for
recruiter I think it's just just missing from here
Okay I would like to build one where I pl I plug
in like 20 YouTube channels of of you know other
channels in my niche and it sorts them from most
to least viewed videos It finds the person that
was interviewed and then it finds them on LinkedIn
and starts messaging them Hey you were on this
podcast I have a very similar podcast You want to
come on mine Like that's pretty simple right Yeah
I mean there's like a scrape YouTube via Lindy
chat here Uhhuh Yeah Yeah Totally Oh man What
about building agencies on top of Lindy What are
you seeing there We are seeing we're starting to
see people have success with this Like we've got
one in particular I forgot the exact number that

[37:00]
he told me but I think it's starting to generate
like $10,000 a month with his Lindy agency So what
it consists of is like he is posting about us
on on LinkedIn and he's making videos about us
on his YouTube channel and he's like "Hey check
out this like cool lindy." He's basically doing
what I just did except he's selling his services
right So he's like "Hey like check out this cool
lindy This is how I've set it up This is how
it works." And it's a cool demo too Like these
demos are just compelling And then she you know he
gives the template in the in the description And
and and he's got a lot of people reaching out to
him who are like I don't want the template I want
you to set it up for me and he also offers that
service And then he's I think he charges like a
onetime fee I'm not familiar with his pricing but
I believe he's charging like a onetime setup fee
and then like an ongoing maintenance fee of like
$500 or $1,000 a month which is nothing Like if
you think of like a just like pay for itself like
three leads or something Yeah And then he's he's
mostly finding customers just by putting out free
content That's right That's right Yeah And most of
them will go on to either do nothing or implement
it themselves but a minority of them will say "Hey

[38:02]
just do this for me." That's right And it doesn't
take a lot You know if you're charging like 500
bucks a month per customer like 10 customers
you've got $5,000 a month Like I do believe AI
agencies are the future because most people they
either don't know how to set up these AI agents
or even if they know they don't have the time to
So AI like address both of these issues If someone
were to launch an agency what industry would you
attack first I would only say any industry that
you're familiar with any industry where you've
got an audience and you understands the industry
and the challenges it's facing Just focus on that
because every industry can benefit from AI agents
Again like AI agents are basically AI employees
Every industry's got employees you know So every
industry could benefit from having AI employees
instead because they're just better cheaper are
faster they're more intelligent So um yeah just
any industry that you're familiar with What about
using Lindy for lead generation either for your
own business or in selling leads as a business
Are you seeing any of that Yeah absolutely So
look you know the recruiting use case just showed

[39:04]
that's kind of like a gen use case like like
recruiting expensive leads too That's 100% So
and it's really targeting like it's really finding
exactly what I asked for here right I was like hey
like directors of sales at like like London here
like Dropbox and so forth So it's Yes we've got a
bunch of lead sources integrated in Lindy The best
one is is one that we call people data labs It's
just like a lead suit It's almost like Mercury
but not Mercury Sorry Apollo Basically it's like
better than Apollo in my in my experience The
leads are better It's like less stale Otherwise
we also have like a ton of scrapers Like we have
like thousands and thousands of web scrapers Like
I'll give you an example We have a customer He
has like a It's funny He's got like a a music
studio for video games Like he makes like music
tracks for video games And so he set up a Lindy
to scrape the steam store for him So it it gets
kind of niche you You know it's really scrape
the what The the Steam web stool Have you heard
of Steam Oh yeah Yeah Yeah Okay Steam Yeah Like

[40:02]
the the game marketplace That's right That's
right That's right That's right So hey scrape
steam Find independent studios like smaller than
X like less than X in sales because if they're
too big they've got their own in-house music
person And then for each of these people look
on the internet for their contact information and
reach out to them Yeah Oh man Okay This is maybe a
difficult question but if you were forced to nuke
all of your partners like all of your integration
partners except three which three would you keep
Like which are the most just the most powerful
Doesn't need to be the most common like Gmail or
Sheets just the most absolute powerful integration
paired with Lindy Yeah I think this one like
the people data labs one is is so powerful
like this ability to just find people I find it
is so awesome I think this like scraper like we
integrate with aify like kudos to their team I
think they've done an amazing job and like appy

[41:00]
just gives you thousands of scrapers It's kind of
a cheat answer to your question because it's kind
of like you know wishing for more wishes because
it's just g like thousands of scrapers but that's
that's just such an awesome one I really like the
YouTube one actually Okay Yeah And what about like
voice agents Is would that be one Oh yeah I don't
really think of it as like an integration I think
of it as as a capability of the platform But
okay Okay What part of all this is still too
hard for Lindy but that you think Lindy will be
be able to tackle It's a good question I think
of Lindy's today and AI agents They're not really
AI employees like that's more aspirational I think
of them more as like AI interns So any simple
enough tasks that you can define as a sequence
of steps right Even if it's not always the same
sequence you can give a playbook to someone and
ask them to to do it Like AI agents are really
good for this If there's like a lot of ambiguity
or if it's really a problem where it's like look
I I don't really know You've got to figure it out
Like when you hire VPs at a startup like a VP of
sales a VP of marketing I love this quote from

[42:00]
Steve Jobs that's like we don't hire smart people
to tell them what to do We hire them so they tell
us what to do you know M and so if you really need
this person that's like hey I need you to help me
figure out my marketing strategy and like drive it
home like this kind of long time horizon task AI
agents or today poly should it but it's changing
changing rapidly very rapidly I think I think in
a couple of years it's basically going to be a
full-blown AI employee okay what feature requests
are people asking for the most embarrassing we
don't have team accounts yet like you can't really
like collaborate with your team on Lindy that's
that's coming soon They're asking for computer
use the ability for Lindy to use their computer
That's coming soon They're asking for it's a pain
for people to create their own Lindies because
you you've got to do that So just a sneak peek
here This is just my account because I'm I'm a
admin This is not yet available in mind but like
we all building this like it's basically like
cursor for Lindy It's like a an agent copilot

[43:00]
that creates agents for you Yeah man Okay What
did I miss Is there anything I didn't ask you
that I should have asked you Like my mind is blown
No I think we covered a lot of good ground It's It
does make your head spin to think of AI agents
like today and then where they're going to be
in the future I think people don't totally
understand what's happening right now Well
we know where to find you Well we know where to
find Lindy Where can we find you Just email me at
flow lindy.ai I'm also on on Twitter at uh like
X Do people say X now Alimo A L T I M O Okay And
we know that if we email you we're probably going
to get Lindy responding but that's okay You never
know But yes most likely responding No I do I
do read I do read most custom mails Yeah Well
thank you for your time Yeah Thank you so much
for having me I would really appreciate it if
you used my Lindy affiliate link in the show
notes I'll get a little kickback You'll get
a little kickback And please share it with a
friend We'll see you next time on the Kerner
