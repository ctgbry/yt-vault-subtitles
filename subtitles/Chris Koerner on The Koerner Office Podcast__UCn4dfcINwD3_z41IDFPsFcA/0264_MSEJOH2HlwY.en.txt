what so embarrassing about this video
here yes that's me that was taken just
this morning I cut down a tree with an
electric chainsaw go ahead make fun of
me but that's not even the embarrassing
part the embarrassing part is I own a
tree trimming company and I have for
over a year and this is the first tree
I've ever cut down maybe that's why my
fence broke but here's why that's
important I own eight companies I
shouldn't need to be in the weeds of any
of them if you own a business and if you
were to go away for 6 months and come
back and the business is not even doing
better without you then you don't own
the business the business owns you you
need to be out of the weeds out of the
details of your business otherwise what
you have is even worse than a job
