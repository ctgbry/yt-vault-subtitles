[00:00]
I did the math yesterday we were making
about $60 on each planter everybody who
sells a house usually gives the client a
gift and I think it's a great way for a
realtor to be front of mine four times
of year every time I come and change out
the flowers they're going to think like
oh okay right you know darl's got me go
most guys cut grass because it leads to
bigger jobs with the flowers I'm getting
the customer base but I have far less
overhead if you can avoid changing the
plant unloading a truck if you're just
pre-building everything and swapping
it's very
[Music]
scalable why don't we just start by you
telling everyone who you are and what
you do so my name is Daryl Knight and I
own a business called from por Flora I
started in 2020 it actually kind of got
the idea while I was on a fishing trip
we had met a guy who invented it's a
tray that you can kind of grow multiple
different plants together it's called a
plant pie and so he made this invention
and we were originally kind of talking

[01:02]
and we were originally kind of talking
with him to see if he was looking for
investors that kind of hit a dead end
and we sort of backed into doing the
seasonal flower subscription so we
wanted to do something with seasonal
with subscription based like billing so
that kind of started our business idea
originally we were thinking if we could
get green houses to grow things pre-made
for us and then have them deliver to
different nurseries the nurseries would
be open to us driving you know foot
traffic to their shops because if
they're there to pick up our stuff they
might be there you know they might buy
extras while they're there what it ended
up being was we buy from green houses
the plants before they get to a nursery
I preassemble everything in a container
and then I just swap out old container
for new container and then that's inside
a fancier planter so backing up what was
your back before this like what gave you

[02:02]
your back before this like what gave you
the confidence or the experience to want
to start a front porch floral business
yeah so I guess that would have been a
good better way to start I started
Landscaping I was
12 nice and then I really got into doing
like masonry landscape design like whole
projects at 14 so I started working with
another company on Long Island called SK
complete so I worked for them until I
was 22 and then during that time when I
my college Years I went to a school in
Long Island called Farmingdale got my
associates degree in horiculture and
landscape design and then from there I
actually took a small Hiatus became a
police officer for short for a period of
time and then I always wanted to get
back
into the like the horiculture side when
I was older there's also a period of
time where I worked at a nursery so I
have the background in plants and my
actually my experience at the nursery is

[03:00]
actually my experience at the nursery is
really where I kind of felt like I was
sort of on to something where a lot of
customers would come to me and ask for
guidance and we'd kind of map out their
whole property and see how we could do
some put something together that that
looked sharp but also like made sense as
far as not putting the wrong plants
you're not g to put a shade plant in a
full sun spot that's where I got that
confidence I guess to to to go into
something like this what was the name of
the the pie product that the guy was
inventing called the plant pie plant pie
what about that just like sounded like a
really good idea to you it's called a
combo and usually it's like two or three
plants that are already pregrown
together from the greenhouse what we
liked about the plant pie was the way
that he Pat he made this I guess unique
design on the bottom of the tray so the
roots kind of self- prune and it was
very shallow so you're talking about
maybe two inches of soil if you think
about this if you had if you wanted to
plant flowers in a bed of mulch you know
you still have to you have to pull your
mulch back and still dig down into the
soil to plant M with something like the

[04:01]
soil to plant M with something like the
plant pie you could literally just pull
the mulch back put the plant pie down
push the mulch back and you're on to
planting the next Plant and it'll root
within a week almost like sod you know
we were like oh this is almost like sod
for flowers what is it made out of just
plastic just a plastic tray interesting
so that's just like your background
caused you to just immediately fall in
love with that idea which ultimately LED
you to what you're doing today correct
interesting it's so funny like looking
back and connecting the dots and it all
makes sense in looking back but at the
time you're just it kind of seems like
you're just hopping from thing to thing
right it definitely evolved from first
year to where I'm at now it's evolved
quite a bit Co hits and you want to
start like a did it start as like a more
traditional flower subscription business
and then evolved into what it is today
yeah and we originally we're looking for
something a little bit more passive than
what it's become you know we were
thinking that if we could kind of get
these deal like these orders in and then

[05:02]
these deal like these orders in and then
the green houses are basically
fulfilling orders then delivering to
their usual
nurseries and then it more so evolved
into a service business okay so you you
basically wanted to go out and find
customers and then go find a nursery and
say hey we're going to buy directly from
you but we want you to do a little more
work and did you want them to deliver
the flowers or they were just going to
prepare them and then you deliver them
they were going to prepare them so like
a typical Greenhouse will grow
thousands of flowers and then different
nurseries will place orders for a few
hundred so we wanted to kind of get into
that that mix where the the order would
come in through my website and then
maybe have a few options of of different
Arrangements the customer places the
order the greenhouse grows it and then
the finished product gets delivered to
the nursery and the customer is required
to then go to the nursery and pick it
up okay okay so why didn't that work
because it was just too too too much of
a change for the nurseries no so the

[06:02]
a change for the nurseries no so the
nursery and I'm the nursery that I grew
up working at they were open to the idea
because obviously they want that extra
foot traffic there however there's also
a requirement for them as well because
the customer would have to show either
like a QR code or receipt once it's once
if it started to turn into something
larger you know I think the nursery
itself would then almost need somebody
to dedicate to making sure that things
were paid for stuff like that so that
was a hurdle other the biggest hurdle
really was that plant pie tray it didn't
really catch on with those green houses
they like things that could be so the
plant pie there's two sizes but it
doesn't fit in anything whereas you
could buy uh like a little 4inch square
planter and that fits into a tray you
know and you can get 15 on a tray so the
plant pie doesn't really work like that
everything is like the shelves for

[07:00]
everything is like the shelves for
shipping they're all square or rectangle
so sort of the reason why it wasn't
catching on was the nurseries had all
already heard about it they just weren't
jumping all over it it wasn't
standardized enough for their procedures
right yeah correct it just I think we
were trying to kind of fit a a round Peg
through a square hole Yeah I mean
literally yeah literally okay so you
kind of built the business around the
you said all right we're not going to
invent in we're not going to invest in
the plant P we're going to start a a a
floral subscription business around the
plant pie and then then the greenhouse
has said H this doesn't really work for
us for X Y or Z reason so then you
pivoted into doing it ourselves really
okay you pivoted just to a more
traditional model then correct so then
it started with we were doing the
Planters at everyone's house and I did
that for the first year and then I
pivoted again and I switched to doing it

[08:02]
pivoted again and I switched to doing it
as an insert so what I would do is I
would buy a planter so I'll buy a
whatever like a $30 planter from
Lowe's I will get an insert that fits
inside of it and then I'll fill up
halfway with
Mulch and then all the inserts I build
at my house so I'll pre pre-assemble
everything all in one shot and then go
out and then my driver will take out the
old insert with the old Arrangement
that's starting to fade and we'll pop in
a new one okay and that's the same
business model you're doing today yes
some of my customers some of my more
affluent customers they still they have
their own Planters and there is no
insert that's going to fit there so we
have to you know bring a truck and and
make it right there on the spot but I
prefer and I will be pushing again this
year to convert almost all of my
customers to a to an insert style
because I don't charge anything for the
planter I own the planter if you cancel

[09:01]
planter I own the planter if you cancel
the service we'll come collect it I find
it it works well and most people are not
very picky about the planter okay so
these Planters are is there one on each
side of the door then or is there more
than that most houses do two on the
front porch okay so you fill it up with
Mulch and is that just to get it get the
plant off the ground more so the way the
insert works is it you know if you don't
put something underneath it it's going
to sink Too Far Low where you wouldn't
see the plants much you want that that
insert to sit right at you know flush
just a little low the reason why I use
mulch instead of like soil for summer
which is our longest season the plants
will actually root through the insert
and into the the material underneath
with soil it could be very difficult to
get it out with M mulch it'll pull right
out even if it's rooted through but the
plant stays in the insert correct right
which is sitting inside the planter and
the insert sitting on top of the mulch
correct and if the roots go through the
the insert into the mulch no big deal
you can pull it out with no problem yeah

[10:00]
you can pull it out with no problem yeah
pop right out do you have any direct
competitors in your area doing exactly
this or are they doing more traditional
floral delivery there's a few businesses
on Long Island that do like seasonal
color changes I don't consider myself
very big but I think I might be I think
on top as far as maybe the numbers I
think a few of them seem like almost
like hobbyists and they stay in kind of
like a localized area okay so how often
are you swapping out the plants four
times a year okay when they start to
fade or just on a schedule no matter
what they're on a schedule no matter
what so even if they do look good I'm
still going to take them out because
they're about to start stop looking good
where do they go when you take them out
some of the plants that we use for the
spring they can be reused for the uh
summer there's not a lot but there are
some so typically like if you were to
look at if you went through the seasons
like there's a pansies and I don't know
if you're familiar with that but pans is
like a cool Season flower so spring
pansies they're going to kind of go to
they're going to look like as soon as it

[11:00]
they're going to look like as soon as it
gets real hot so we would you know take
that out and that's basically done
there's not much what we would do with
that whereas if you had maybe like a
petunia that's something that if it it
looked good you might be able to
repurpose that in another planter okay
but usually like most of them you're
just kind of throwing out you're just
done correct yeah okay what are your big
sellers patunas pansies do you do tulips
or anything we stop doing tulips because
the bulb plants they look awesome when
you put them in and they're in bloom but
they just they the rise and fall for
those is too fast so I usually avoid I
usually avoid those so for me spring is
like a ranunculus pansies creeping jenny
if it's available it's like a Spiller I
think I mentioned patunas already so I
always try to kind of switch it up
because I want the customers to get like
to experience new things so just not
getting the same exact thing over and
over again and make sure that they're
always getting something different that
way you can get at a grocery store yeah
okay that is honestly that's my major

[12:02]
okay that is honestly that's my major
competitor is is dealing with like kind
of the cheaper option at the grocery
store smart is there a margin difference
on any of these plants or does it really
make no difference to you the majority
of my 4 inch plants they're usually
about the same price within a dollar or
two and then my center pieces that's
really where you can kind of trip up if
you're not careful because some of them
get pretty pricey okay and you're buying
these directly from the from the green
houses correct yeah okay have you
thought about vertically integrating and
growing them yourself or is that just a
completely different business too much
headache I have I live on two acres so I
do have space so I still have a
full-time job and I think I'm just not
yeah I think I'm just not there yet as
far as having the time to do that yeah
what are your pricing plans a small
planter which is up to 12 in that's $90
a season per planter a medium is going
to be1 $ a season per planter and then a

[13:01]
to be1 $ a season per planter and then a
large is$ 145 and then from there it's
custom pricing okay so you're looking at
like five to 700 to 800 a year per
customer yeah yep we have about 100 okay
is there any long-term contract or
anything or just kind of no they can
cancel anytime the only time that
there's any fee with the cancellation is
if they can if they cancel on the plants
they've already been purchased I mean
typically this time of year we might see
some some people fall off or just fail
to renew but other than that there's no
like a hard contract that anybody would
have to follow okay and then you said a
100 is that how many customers you have
yeah that's about as awesome all right
if you are watching this clip right now
you are watching this on YouTube and if
you are a fan of podcast please check
out my podcast while you're at it
because sometimes I have podcasts that
aren't on YouTube and sometimes I have
YouTubes that aren't on podcast so check
out the Kerner office on any podcast
platform or you can go to TKO pod.com
also my newsletter will throw that in

[14:00]
also my newsletter will throw that in
there there are no ads It's weekly it's
different content than my podcast and
YouTube newsletter. chrisj cerner.com
You'll see the link and we'll see you
there so what I did is I set it up so
that you could do two two seasons if you
wanted or you could do three or you
could do four and the reason I did that
is you could have a single season
subscription for just the plants around
the pool you're not going to do Four
Seasons around the pool but you most
likely would want the summer covered
every year and not have to call me and
tell me some customers also they just
want maybe like a Summer full and they
don't want to do spring and winter so my
busiest seasons are summer which is the
first season that you could get a if
you're if you're starting off with just
two seasons then summer would be the
first season that you would get
flowers okay so summer and fall are
really my busiest two seasons and those
two are about a 100 accounts okay and
how many seasons does your average
customer choose most customers are at
four oh nice okay and how are you how

[15:01]
four oh nice okay and how are you how
are you finding customers today versus
how did you find them in year one and
two we were getting mostly through
Facebook ads or organic it was a lot of
friends and family to start for sure
okay and that was really where we got
our content to to post and most of it
then still was coming through Facebook
and that kind of made me think that that
was our demographic was like a little
bit on the older side as of late it's
really transitioned more to Instagram
converting the most so are you seeing
like more Millennial customers now
whereas there's more Boomers on Facebook
Okay correct yeah are you doing any paid
ads or all or just organic just posting
content and it comes so there's a I
don't know I don't think this is
Countrywide is something called stroll
they have it somewhat in more affluent
neighborhoods there's stroll Nissa quag
so we just did a like a paid ad through
them is that a magazine it's a magazine
so it's a magazine
to kind of be like it's for the

[16:02]
to kind of be like it's for the
residents so the the residents of that
those towns all get it for free and it's
it's funded it's basically subsidized by
all the the
advertisers okay you kind of pay for
this base so have you seen that actually
bring in business no so this year will
be my first year doing that okay I would
imagine just by the nature of the
product that you'd see some referrals
because friends come over and they see
them and like oh I love your flowers
right at the door it's like what where'd
you get those oh I get them from Daryl
matter of fact I mean through watching
your show or your your podcast we
started the pumpkins last year we
already had customer we already had the
customer base in in in place that was
big as far as just getting eyeballs on
that really got us like a lot of
attention I went from not thinking I
would sell any because I was just
looking to kind of get some photos and
put out content and see what the
feedback was to selling like 14 14
different packages in in a couple of
weeks and then that converted again into

[17:01]
weeks and then that converted again into
like recurring customers for a Christmas
season and then one of them is now like
guess is a real good account for next
year overall that's amazing is that how
you found me from that piece of content
or was it before then nope pumpkins was
it that's amazing yeah there's a there's
a lot of people that started a porch
pumpkin business based on that like I I
post a lot of stuff right but I think
that one had one of the higher
percentages of people actually taking
action which is super cool it's funny
because I actually met somebody else I
had listed some of the pumpkin packages
on Facebook Marketplace just to see how
that panned out and another entrepreneur
from Pennsylvania he tried to kind of
like undercover me at first a little bit
and ask like the pricing but when I
looked him up I saw that he was doing
the same thing in Pennsylvania so a
couple like young guys they do like
party rentals and stuff too and so we
ended up just kind of like chopping it
up over the phone a little bit yeah I
mean you're not competitors right so why
not that's why I texted him I said
listen we're not competitors you want to
just talk about it on the phone so he

[18:01]
just talk about it on the phone so he
was like you know he was all into it and
he seemed like a good group of guys in
Pennsylvania doing that so that's
awesome have you thought about doing
Christmas decoration front porch we
started doing that so that kind of
inspired them the Christmas stuff and I
saw the things that you had put on there
for Christmas we ended up moving away
from it I never pulled I pulled the
trigger on the supplies and starting to
create it but what I ended up doing was
I kind of wanted to do something very
similar to the pumpkins where there was
like instead of the pumpkin spilling
down the front steps it was like little
trees coming down the steps mhm so we
ended up doing uh yard displays and
basically Christmas trees on porches and
I don't if you have access to our
Instagram but you'll see like we had we
actually just took like their grow bags
and we wrapped them in ribbon and they
they came out pretty good oh I see it
right here yeah that's awesome you just
kept them in the bag so that's a grow
bag it's meant it's meant to be for
vegetables but what we would do is we
would we would brace the tree
upright and then I would fill the bag in

[19:02]
upright and then I would fill the bag in
with soil just to keep it heavy and help
hold the this the tree sand in place and
then and we wrap it in ribbon and then
that was that was basically it and then
you just take it back at the end of the
season that was it yeah that would that
for that season I decided to offer like
a free cleanup so I wasn't charging like
I was charging with the pumpkins to
remove it okay how did you determine how
to price this did you look at a
competitor and how they they did it or
yeah I would say that this year that the
trees I probably underpriced them to be
honest or really I mean anything
anything in your business I was tried to
create a formula for like the size of
each planter that never really worked so
what we ended up doing was just
calculating what we were spending on
soil the material the plant material and
then manow to make it and deliver it and
then kind of figuring out like where we
wanted it to be like what what our
margin we wanted to be after that MH so

[20:03]
margin we wanted to be after that MH so
I mean for me with the Planters I think
I did the math yesterday we were making
about $60 on each planter nice so what
would you say your net margins are
overall in the business the net margin
is going to be what my total for the
year or you say your net profit yeah
total profit as a percentage basis or 60
times even if we go low ball I mean each
season we're probably making about 10
10,000 nice do you have any employees so
I have a hard time hanging on to them
because we are very seasonal I had one
woman who worked for me she was a little
bit older so we worked with her for two
years and then I actually just felt too
guilty to keep pushing her through it
yeah and then just because it's
physically demanding it can be I think
it's just a lot of bending down and

[21:00]
it's just a lot of bending down and
getting back up and then you know when
it gets cold it's kind of miserable and
you know she's pushing herself through
like arthritis and bad knees and but she
was with me for two years and then I
have another younger guy who works with
me he's been great he's been with me for
two years as well and then this past
year it expanded into actual like larger
landscape projects and that's where
that's where I'm more so having an issue
with just keeping guys around because
the work is not steady enough and I
think you know when I'm retired from my
full-time I'll be able to kind of keep
those guys around but for now it's I I
really need to Target people who are
kind of either part-time employed or you
know kind of winding down in their
careers yeah so it's like a great foot
in the door business where you it's kind
of a lower ticket item you earn their
trust and then you could upsell I kind
of identified two SE two years ago so
what so growing up in my family doing

[22:02]
what so growing up in my family doing
the Landscaping they are running you
know truck trailer team of guys huge
fuel bills hu huge Insurance bills to
cut grass the prices for grass have not
really gone up even since I was cutting
grass 15 16 years ago so but most guys
cut grass because it leads to bigger
jobs MH with the flowers I'm getting the
customer base they know that I know how
to plant what looks good the design
aspect but I'm I have far less overhead
so for me this seems like a great foot
in the door for that industry as well so
I started seeing in 2021 people were
asking me more and more to do like oh
can you plant in my garden and I was
just referring the jobs
away and then 22 I started to take on
more landscaping jobs 23 again same

[23:01]
more landscaping jobs 23 again same
thing and then last year we started
taking on bigger and bigger jobs and
what is your full-time job I'm a police
officer okay you did that before and
then you went back to it or you've been
doing it this whole time I've been doing
it since I was 22 okay if you were to
like go all in on this and like really
go hard and try to scale it just on Long
Island how scalable would you say that
it is if you really wanted to acquire a
th customers if I wanted to acquire a
thousand customers I mean scalable I
think the the flower pots I think are
very scalable if you can avoid doing get
out changing the plant unloading the
truck if you're just pre-building
everything and swapping it's very
scalable but then a uh after that you're
going to need like a very large team if
you're going to houses unloading ripping
out it's you really lose a lot of time
like that especially in the winter yeah

[24:03]
like that especially in the winter yeah
every season how much how many hours of
labor would you say it takes to fulfill
your service let's say you don't do
anything Hands-On you're just like on a
computer working part-time helping
arranging Logistics and you have an
employee managing a hundred clients how
many for the three months how many total
hours would you think that takes not
like per week not per month but total I
would say we could do if I have all my
plants in front of me I could probably
have those built no no more than two
days with just the inserts so let's call
that 16 hours okay yep and then I would
say you would have another week then of
driving around so there's 40 hours for
hours okay but the hard part is that
spread over three months so it's hard to
find someone that can really commit to
that right because they can't rely on on
that yeah that is my so spring is great

[25:00]
that yeah that is my so spring is great
because spring will carry me right
through to Summer especially with the
Landscaping now where people are looking
to do plantings and things like that but
then when you look
to you know like late summer it really
slows down yeah and that's where you
know guys who are you know they're
looking for they're looking to work
that's where you lose them okay so 56
hours of Labor to fulfill enough plants
for one season right correct yeah yeah
okay so if you're paying someone uh $25
an hour that's like 13 14500 bucks after
after payroll taxes so theoretically if
you're profiting 10 grand in a season
ignoring all of the complexities with it
being unstable very seasonal you could
make good margins like even farming out
the hard work you could still have
really good net profit margins on this
right yeah so a thousand customers would
be 10 times as much maybe even more
profit because you'd be at more scale

[26:01]
profit because you'd be at more scale
and they could rely on on more hours
like maybe in the offseason they could
do a little more marketing during the
season they could do more logistical
stuff yeah right do you think if you
were to like ramp up Facebook ads or
really go hard on the customer
acquisition side you could ignoring all
the logistical difficulties you could
find a way to acquire enough customers
to really scale not that you should I'm
just curious how scalable it is right
now like I was saying before for this
year I want to try to push as many
existing customers that are on the the
custom uh accounts where I have to get
out and do it there if I could push more
and more of those customers the existing
ones into an insert type situation then
I think for me then I would look to
start growing again because I'm at I'm
I'm at a point right now where
especially for winter where I'm almost
not able to get it done before Christmas
time so that is really the season that
I'm most concerned about fulfilling and
I really want to make sure that for

[27:00]
I really want to make sure that for
customer service we're top-notch because
I don't think this business really you
it's not going to make your it's not
going to improve the quality of your
life other than you know you love how
your house looks when you walk up right
but I want to be known like as a as a
topnotch customer service company so
with that said if I can if I can convert
a lot of those accounts into inserts I
think my ability to fulfill more
accounts is going to I think then
kind of it'll open up for me right now
I'm I'm nervous to actually sink
in uh a lot more effort into customer
acquisition when I'm close to maxed out
being that I have that full-time job
yeah because you you get to that point
where it's like you've got you either
have to stay where you're at or go
really hard because or else you end up
in the messy middle right yeah and I'm
I'm like playing with the messy middle
right now I think you're flirting with
it yeah okay what is your turn like how
many how long do you keep customers on

[28:01]
many how long do you keep customers on
average I don't know maybe 20 customers
in the almost five years most people are
saying I really I've had two customers
that I've let go of myself I would say
yeah it's about about 20 customers total
that I've lost what a great business the
customers that I typically lose are the
ones that it's a gift for a family
member okay yeah they're not really
invested in it they're not invested in
it and
you know it's nice but you know maybe
next year you don't want to spend you
know 450 bucks on you know flowers for
your mom if you want to do something
different and I I get that too so yeah
it's nice for people to gift it to
others but it also means higher
likelihood of them churning yes I think
I actually I would really like to do is
try to get in with some Realtors because
I think you know everybody who sells a
house usually gives the C the the the
client a gift and I think it's a great
way for a realtor to like

be front of M four times a year every
time they I come and change out the
flowers they're going to think like oh
okay right great idea yeah you need to
lean into that that's a really good idea
and what is the average home value on
Long
Island half million dollars all right so
that's $15,000 average commission so 500
bucks would be a tiny fraction of that
yeah that's a good idea yeah I mean you
could sell it to the Realtors as an
investment you know you're going to be
top of money you're going to be their
favorite realtor for the rest of their
lives yeah idea or at least four seasons
