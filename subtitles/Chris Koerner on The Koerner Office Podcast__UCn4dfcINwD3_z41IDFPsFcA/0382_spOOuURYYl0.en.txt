I spend $50,000 at this store every week
which means I am the biggest bies
customer in the world and the biggest
bies fan in the world so these are the
six most underrated snacks that you can
buy from bies that no one's talking
about this is the peanut butter blast
trail mix it is not healthy but yes it
will get you up Mount Everest you've got
honey roasted peanuts salted peanuts
Reese's Pieces and mini Reese's Cups it
is amazing and it's really hard to put
this at number six number five fever
buddies animal cookies these are not
animal crackers these are cookies they
have sprinkled they're crispy they're
crunchy great texture M really good
forget beaver nuggets those are really
sweet they're good but it's kind of a
lot white cheddar Beaver these aren't
beaver nuggets these are Bucky nuggies
these are white cheddar it's kind of
like Pirates Booty but there's nothing
healthy about it super strong white
cheddar flavor and number three buy milk
chocolate caramel overbite why do I like
this because Hershey's is garbage it
tastes like candle wax this actually
high quality chocolate like European
chocolate number two The Bold and sort

Air number one I'm really excited about
this strawberry Sour Power candy belt I
love sour stuff and I love this because
it's extra sour you put it in your mouth
and it just punches you in the face
really really good really sour the Best
Buy experience is to come to a Buy
location in person the second best is to
