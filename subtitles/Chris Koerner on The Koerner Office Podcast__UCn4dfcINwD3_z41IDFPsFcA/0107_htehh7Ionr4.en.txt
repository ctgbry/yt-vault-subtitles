there's a URL suffix that you can add to
any Shopify store that will show you all
of their products by best to worst
selling okay okay I've done this before
so basically use builtwith domcom to
find a bunch of Shopify stores and then
you're going to take a spreadsheet put
all of their URLs and then use the
concate Nate function to attach the same
URL suffix to all of these different
Shopify store urls
then you'll be able to see you can do
this manually or hire a VA to do this
exactly which of their products sell the
most in that current
[Music]
moment welcome to the ker office we had
five Callin Andor pres submitted
questions from entrepreneurs and
wantrepreneurs today the first guy had a
really genius product idea that he wants
to develop and sell on Amazon but he had
no idea where to start next guy wanted
to know how can I find Niche products to
sell that no one else is selling maybe

[01:00]
sell that no one else is selling maybe
people are already selling them but
they've got some pain points that I want
to fix the third person was a pres
submitted question about using Amazon
FBA as in fulfilled by Amazon to make
passive income so that's three in a row
that all develop around selling
e-commerce stuff on Amazon or Shopify or
developing products pretty cool stuff
fourth person has a tutoring business
growing exclusively through Facebook
groups and having some success but he
needed advice he's a young guy he's in
college and he's doing well but I gave
him some tips and the last person was
pres submitted asking about what AI
business should I start what AI business
would you start Chris and so I gave him
two decent ideas and I hope you like And
subscribe and share this with your
friends including your grandma because
we all love your
grandma hey how are you Gil good how are
you good thanks for joining yeah thanks
for having me so if I pull up your
question I I I don't really know
anything about you I want you've got an
idea and you want some feedback on it
yeah so basically I've been uh
entrepreneur for 10 years life's been

[02:01]
entrepreneur for 10 years life's been
busy with the kids got a four-year-old
son who has autism so he's taken up a
lot of time we got a 20-month old but
we're getting to a point where I have
some time to finally start to do a
project for myself I've done other
things in the past where I started
things up nothing really took off uh
freelance graphic design as like a
renting a trailer and outdoorsy kind of
thing but I am interested in starting
like a pro an item to sell on Amazon
okay so and just have an idea
I guess I'm looking for a little bit of
validation for my idea and if it's good
maybe what would be the first steps into
like having it made okay so before we
talk about your product idea what first
gave you the idea to sell something on
Amazon I just with the the amount of
time that I have I because I could
always try to do freelancing but I'm
just like with the kids and everything I
just wanted to do something where I can
sell an item and just be on the back and
not having to deal with like clients and
stuff like that at this point in my life

[03:00]
stuff like that at this point in my life
right now the ever elusive passive
income right well yeah I guess passive
in elusive passive income but I mean
obviously I know that it's going to be a
lot of work yeah so so yeah was there
like do you follow someone on social
media that has been talking about this
what first gave you that idea for for
like doing an Amazon item well I've been
listening to you know no King and I read
his book you know I've been the r SES of
Tim Ferris Tim Ferris and all that so so
I wanted to address a pain point that I
was having in my life and so that's
where the my idea was well it' be
awesome if I had this product even for
myself there has to be someone else out
there that has the same paino as me yeah
okay all right what is your product idea
so I have it's an issue with my glasses
I have three pairs of glasses that I use
and they're scattered all over the place
and when whenever I go somewhere I have
to take off three of them because
computer distance sunglasses

[04:00]
computer distance sunglasses
prescription and they're all over the
place and it just looks like this and
they're just like um it's just kind of a
pain to find them and everything so I
thought it would be great if if I had a
product where I had these cases that
were all magnetic that could just stick
together and so to keep everything
organized in one spot but then also
maybe for travel have like a little case
that they could fit in so just yeah so
that's pretty much the idea I've reached
out to friends and family about it and
asked for feedback and I've gotten good
feedback my sister was like that's a
great idea I would totally buy that my
one of my best friends was like I
wouldn't buy that does he does he have
glasses he does why wouldn't he buy it
like I don't he he said I wouldn't buy
that but I can see how some like really
old people like I can see why a cenow
person would buy this but I wouldn't
losing person I mean honestly it's nice
to have friends that are honest with you
because I can't tell you how many
friends have told me oh yeah I would do

[05:01]
friends have told me oh yeah I would do
that and then I actually do it and
they're like oh well let me you know
yeah you had some say I would buy it and
one said I wouldn't how many people have
you talked to specifically I reached out
to all my family so probably like almost
10 people okay and what percentage would
buy it some of them don't have glasses
so don't wear glasses so I would say
that the people that's that wore glasses
told me yes except for my friend Adam
now would it be like a magnet that holds
them together or would it be a case what
would it look like
exactly I was envisioning something like
that's just like a
rectangular case like this and they
would have a magnetic panel on the
inside like a very thin magnetic panel
and then they were all just together and
then we could put it inside a little
container that would have a little space
for like your wallet watch or something
else yeah maybe something you could put
on your bedside your stand next to your
on your nightstand or anywhere okay so
it really could just look like I'm
picturing something the shape almost

[06:00]
picturing something the shape almost
like a matchbox right just something
rectangular but as as thin as possible
that had magnets on the inside that just
they they could stand alone as their own
case but they also they they're stuck
together right yes I like that idea
because it's not like you could just
take existing stuff and piece it
together right you don't have to go get
molds made I like it for that reason I
mean you could even make that in your
living room just with magnets and box
right yeah and I was thinking I would do
it start with just taking some
cardboards some cartons mean just like
cutting it all up and just just to get
the visual of what it's looks like so
one problem I foresee with this is
selling it on Amazon because on Amazon
you got to match search traffic and yeah
people
are have you done any research on Amazon
searches like with jungle Scout to see
what type of glasses accessory people
are already searching for today

[07:00]
are already searching for today
I haven't looked on with jungle Scout I
did search on Amazon for glasses cases
and like Google and stuff I didn't see a
product like this out
there that that existed yet but I feel
like it's so that it was like hard to
keyword uh search it yeah something like
okay so because you can look up glasses
cases and you're just G to pop up
generic cases yeah so I'll tell you all
the reasons why I do and don't like this
idea
I like it because you could put it
together in your living room pretty
easily you could buy existing things and
put it together it's cheap it's a cheap
it's cheap to buy it's cheap to make and
it serves what 30% have glasses maybe 20
30% of the overall population you could
ship it fairly uh cheaply it's
lightweight it's under 13 ounces which
is key which means you can ship it with
USPS first class which is significantly
cheaper than priority so I like that why
I don't like it is wait another reason

[08:02]
I don't like it is wait another reason
why I really really like it the biggest
reason is it's very short form viral
right in a 5c clip you could show people
exactly what the value proposition is
and so I feel like that more than
outweighs the lack of search traffic on
Amazon for it you if you get this in the
right hands on Instagram and Tik Tok it
could go massively viral the problem
with that is is that you're going to
want to push them to Amazon as opposed
to a Shopify site because that's where
people are comfortable and so you've got
to name this something very specific and
so you're going to create Amazon search
traffic instead of try to piggyback on
something else and so I would make it
like a something with the word mag in it
like mag case or just something silly
like Rhino case something I would do a
lot of research on the name I think the
name is incredibly important in this
case whereas most of the times I don't
think the name is very important make it

[09:01]
think the name is very important make it
something very brandable like with a
color or a shape or like purple
rectangle or Purple Rhino or something
to where when you go on Amazon today and
you start typing it there is no
autocomplete like Amazon doesn't know
where you're going with it because you
can like it's just hard to link to
things in short form video so you just
want to call it something so people know
what to search for now then eventually
you could have a shop if I say site
which is the same name and I would
definitely recommend getting only a. of
that name like not your name plus case
but like just your name.com so then
because some people are going to go to
Tik Tok to search it some people will go
to YouTube to search it some will go to
Amazon and some will go to Google to
search it you want to be creating all of
that search traffic from a brand new
invented term I really really like that
about it because I've seen stupid short
form videos of products like this that
have 30 million views 50 million views

[10:01]
have 30 million views 50 million views
perfect case study for you Kevin asiru
do you know who that is he founded the
Epic gardening Channel he was recently
interviewed on my first million and he
sells a very viral product that's like a
knee brace that helps you kneel in the
garden better and they cannot keep them
in stock and wow the reason why is
because a it fills a need and B it is so
viral video all right it is just so
easily it it so easily portrays the
value proposition in 5 seconds or less
even 3 seconds his video is just like
someone kneeling in the garden with a
brace around it and it's like I get it
immediately I need it I want it it's
springtime I'm gardening product Market
fit product audience fit viral video fit
all of the above so I really like the
idea for that reason why I don't like
the idea is it could be copied okay so
yes someone could see your viral video
and then just start piggy backing and I
think if you're first you will stay

[11:01]
think if you're first you will stay
first but they're just going to start
chipping away at your market share and I
don't like that you can't sell it for
that much because if you wanted to lean
on paid ads for this you need it to be
like at least a $50 product which this
is not right yeah what what do you think
this would be at 20 or less I I think it
just has to be
cheap yeah yeah it couldn't be if try to
make it like a bit of a luxury item or
something that was like super nice and
like two versions you should have a
super like a leather or pleather version
and then a plastic version I think a lot
of people will upgrade to the nicer
version once they try the cheap version
and see that they like it I do think
this is a good idea it's not going to be
passive at all but that's I think it'll
be more successful than what something
passive might
be yeah and it would be aw I mean
awesome if this were something that
eventually it would replace my income
that I'm getting from my job you know
because right now I'm working full-time
and that's the end goal is to create

[12:01]
and that's the end goal is to create
something on the side that eventually
will allow me to quit my job yep how
long have you had this idea ever since I
the Noah Kagan book came out so when
that book came out I read it and that's
what like spurred me to think I'm going
to think about something that I have a
paino that I to fix so that's so
probably how long's that book been out
couple months some months yeah yeah are
you like an ideas guy are you always
having
ideas yeah okay I mean that's okay okay
and this if this is one that you just
can't get out of your head then I think
that's send a signal to its efficacy I'm
an ideas guy but a lot of them just come
and go but if it sticks around then I
got to do something about
it okay yeah but so building it like
you're saying just create some
prototypes at home and just start off
what what would you think would be the
next step after that I would try to make
like a hundred in your living room and
try to sell those to friends and family
in Facebook groups whatever start doing

[13:01]
in Facebook groups whatever start doing
a lot more Market Research in Facebook
groups for people that might buy this
and un rdit and just learning either by
posting and asking or just reading old
comments what they would like this to
look like and then I would make a 100 I
would sell them to friends and family
and ask for all the feedback in the
world make changes maybe they're going
to want round corners or something make
changes based on that and then find out
how long it takes you to assemble these
things from raw materials to finished
product
and assign that into your cost like all
right if I sell this for 20 bucks it's G
to if I pay someone $20 an hour being
conservative to put these together I can
do 10 an hour they're probably only
going to do five per hour so if I'm
conservative on their wage and I'm
conservative on the time it's going to
cost a dollar per labor to put these
together it costs $4 to make them I've
got a 75% gross margin that's a really
good margin if I add in shipping that
cuts my margin to 50% do all that math
and then start to play around with

[14:00]
and then start to play around with
actually selling these on Amazon and I
would just list them on Amazon see how
it goes see if you can capture any
organic traffic and then phase three
would be try to get this video in the
hands of someone that can make it go
viral just start dming people or on your
own personal account or make an account
just you definitely want to make an
account just for this product and then
see if you can push some ads behind it
on Instagram reals and if your if your
CPM on these ads is really really low
then it means that Instagram is showing
it for free to a lot more people because
they're engaging with it and it's
keeping them on the
platform most times I don't recommend
you push like Instagram reels via ads
but this is a paid product and that you
will want to do that with
this okay and you think this it's better
to do that than try to have something
manufactured like in China or designed
and manufactured in China yeah I just I
would order the raw materials from China
but assemble them here because it's

[15:00]
but assemble them here because it's
going to be very
expensive once these are assembled to
get them here in shipping containers and
it's the just adds another layer of
complexity so let's say you're just
putting you're ordering identical boxes
and putting three of them together and
then two magnets in between the three
boxes and putting them together it's
going to be very expensive for them to
be assembled in China and then shipped
here like literally three times more
expensive because of the all the volume
because when you ship stuff you've got
physical weight and then you have what's
called oh what's it called it's like the
weight volume the cost based on I don't
remember what the the phrase is for it
but if it's very simple to assemble
these I would recommend doing it in
house and being in control of that
process because one thing that could
sync you is if you know your first
shipment of 10,000 of these are all put
together wrong that could crush you and
then a competitor could swoop right in
and take the number one
spot okay cool so all right yeah man
awesome well let me know how it goes I

[16:00]
awesome well let me know how it goes I
want to hear I'm excited about this for
you I think it's a good idea I was
prepared to tell you it was a bad idea
but I don't I don't think it
is awesome great thank you so much Chris
appreciate your time yep good luck all
right thank you by
bye all right Natt I'm letting that in
Matt how are you I'm good and you I'm
good so your question is around finding
products with high demand so why don't
you tell me exactly what you're looking
for I'm used to finding demand for apps
right mobile apps but I I don't know how
the physical Goods work so for example
when I want to find demand for a mobile
app I want to go to search ads or sensor
Tower to find that okay the ad has a
good search volume but for physical
Goods I don't know right do you go to
Google keywords to find that this
product is actually good or do you go to
Facebook search ads to find the demand
because otherwise it's a waste of my
time to focus on a certain product that
I know that will not have demand yeah

[17:00]
I know that will not have demand yeah
that that was it I'm naive about the
physical Goods but you do have
experience with the apps you're saying
yeah for intangible goods or mobile apps
yes now are you just trying to resell
existing products that that might like
be hot or trending right
now no not really I'm more like a
Creator I like to create my own product
but then starting from a something
existing right so improve on something
that already
exists Okay so you want to find a
popular product people are already
buying might have a deficiency of some
sort and then you want to put your touch
on it and make it better and then sell
that yeah exactly okay have you looked
at um Jungle Scout yet no so try that
that's specifically for Amazon I think
they're launching to other platforms or
they already have but that will show you
exactly what is hot on Amazon and
exactly what's trending how many units
and it's not perfectly accurate but it's
Direction accurate how many units

[18:00]
Direction accurate how many units
they're selling per month or how many
dollars uh they're making per month and
then you can also go to Alibaba and
AliExpress and Teemu and look at what
they're pushing the most like start
searching different categories and start
paying attention to how they're ranking
your search results because that's
probably what's popular right now
furthermore there is a I don't remember
this so you're gonna have to Google it
but there's a a URL suffix that you can
add to any Shopify store that will show
you all of their products by best to
worst selling okay okay I've done this
before so basically use builtwith domcom
to find a bunch of Shopify stores and
then you're going to take a spreadsheet
put all of their URLs and then use the
concate Nate function to attach the same
URL suffix to all of these different
shop if I store URLs and then you'll be
able to see you can do this manually or

[19:00]
able to see you can do this manually or
hire a VA to do this exactly which of
their products sell the most in that
current moment okay I'm also interested
in the competition right because in in
mobile apps you can see the the
popularity like people searching for
this product and you can also see the
competition right so by definition when
I see high volume of search but High
competition then it's more it's a red
ocean right it's more difficult to
compete you have to compete with price
or with ads which is I don't like those
games so I was thinking is there
something similar that I can find high
volume search below
competition like maybe Shopify for the
high volume they have a lot of stores
that are pursuing the same customers
right right is that a way to do that I
believe so I know there are tools out
there that do that nothing is coming to
mind offhand but there's a tool called I
think Gummy Search which does that for
Reddit it will show you what topics are
talked about the most in any given
subreddit and like what comments have

[20:02]
subreddit and like what comments have
certain like appearances a certain
number of appearances for specific
products or comments in within
subreddits okay Gummy Search works great
but as far as finding out how much
competition there is I know that jungle
Scout does that on Amazon you can see
how many it will show you right there in
the Chrome extension how many sellers
sell that exact product and then I think
you can even add products to like your
watch list to watch over time to see if
they're they're going up or down in
popularity or
competition yeah this G this Gummy
Search looks interesting to me yeah it's
pretty
cool but then hopefully you don't mind
me asking this the Reddit is difficult
to to self promote right so how do you
use this Gummy Search you find where the
demand is and then but then so is is
there a way to self promote on credit
that you oh yeah so I wrote a newsletter
on this like four or five months ago so
if you go to newsletter. chrisj ker.com

[21:01]
if you go to newsletter. chrisj ker.com
there's one specifically about how to go
viral on Reddit there is a way to do it
it's very replicable you just have to
tell your story and show people what
you're building in a very informative
way with a good hook and a good title
and then once it starts taking off then
you can edit the post to add a link
directly to your product or service but
if you put the link in there in the
beginning then it will never take off
because it's too obviously promotional
do you put the link in the first time
that you write the post or at the end
you edit the post no Links at all like
in the beginning it just looks very
value ad and then at the end you're like
edit oh wow this is taking off thank you
so much for anyone asking because a lot
of times the comments will be asking
like what's your product you know I see
and so then you can even comment
directly on those commenters with your
link as well okay so at the end of the
engagement after you have certain posts
or people commenting a couple hours yeah
cuz Reddit will show you exactly how

[22:00]
cuz Reddit will show you exactly how
many people are viewing and reading your
post in any given moment and you'll see
it start to accelerate and so if it
never accelerates then there's never a
point to add the link but as it's like
all right 100 views an hour a thousand
views an hour 5,000 views an hour and
also you want you want to go in the
subreddits and sort by top post by month
by day all time and you want to you want
to make your post a lot like that one
right like if it's braggadocious or or
if it's humble or if it's telling a
story like it's different based on the
subreddit but just try to recreate what
posts have already been viral in that
subred with whatever you're doing yeah
use the formula yeah yep if you go viral
with a certain Reddit post then do you
copy and paste for other subreddits so
or do you with the same account because
it will look like spammy right after you
check your profile you do have to use
the same account most people are not
going to check your profile you just
have to do it in the right way cuz it's

[23:00]
have to do it in the right way cuz it's
really hard to have a lot of Reddit
accounts that have good karma you can
buy Reddit accounts and I've had some
luck with that but eventually they're
likely to get banned if you keep doing
that and that reminds I have 10 minutes
right so yeah you're good that reminds
me that the Google SEO algorithm changed
right which to me it's like prioritizing
organic
content produced by humans right because
people have used the AI organic content
qu unquote what are you using now for
SEO to to rank high in SEO are you on no
we haven't changed anything maybe we
should but we're just we're keep doing
we haven't really seen a hit yet so you
haven't been hit okay I think it's still
pretty early as far as like the AI
changes are concerned in SEO
yeah okay yeah sounds good I I'll check
this gumy search looks interesting to me
yeah and I'll check
jungle Scout yep thank thanks for all

[24:02]
jungle Scout yep thank thanks for all
the good advice on Twitter of course
always like your post thank you Nat I
appreciate
that all right we'll see you later all
right man thank you bye
bye all right I love this question I'm
24 W2 Finance job ever eventually want
to start a business of some sort I'm
married with a baby on the way in the
fall which does limit my risk tolerance
however I'm not afraid to take smart r
risks I'm looking to build something in
off hours from work a business that's
promoted often is Amazon FBA or Retail
Arbitrage I haven't heard you speak on
this in the past I was curious your take
could this be viable for making a five
figure income on the side that could
give me leverage to jump into something
else or does the capped ceiling make it
less attractive option compared to other
Alternatives would love to hear your
thoughts but also if there are any go-to
steps you would take if you were in my
position of looking to start an
entrepreneurship so so all right I have

[25:00]
entrepreneurship so so all right I have
many thoughts on this he's asking if he
can use Retail Arbitrage or Amazon FBA
or whatever to make money on the side so
the previous caller just asked me about
this but he's doing something different
he wants to develop a real physical
product That's Unique that he sells on
Amazon and if you remember I suggested
that he assembl this in his house import
the raw materials from China and
basically own the whole vertical except
the logistics and the third party side
of Logistics which he's going to give to
Amazon but Shopify side he will manage
himself I own a thirdparty logistics
company and even I would not suggest to
most companies that they Outsource that
with rare exception I don't like the
idea of people using FBA or Arbitrage in
most instances to try to make money I
think this Market is very crowded
because of the fact that there are so
many other 24 year olds that tried this
tasted some success maybe they made a
$2,000 profit in a month and then they

[26:00]
$2,000 profit in a month and then they
went to Instagram and they saw a guy
talking about how he makes $200,000 a
month and he thought hm I bet there's a
lot more money in teaching people how to
do this than there is in me doing this
myself because man this is actually
grind this is you know e-commerce is
hard like e-commerce is not passive it
is very hard and you're competing with
everyone in the world and so there is
more money in teaching people how to do
Amazon FBA than there is in starting
Amazon FBA now if you're a big company
already doing it great or if you want to
invest a lot of time and money into
research and development importing stuff
from China that's one thing but if
you're just trying to make a side income
I don't recommend Amazon FBA okay
because you're going to be competing
with everyone else that is buying a
course from that 23-year-old shirtless
dude that posts pictures of himself with
other people's Lamborghinis Okay I would
definitely recommend starting something
that you learn about on the internet
from someone who is not incentivized to

[27:00]
from someone who is not incentivized to
sell you that thing for instance I'm
always tweeting about home service
businesses about gutter cleaning about
Seamless Gutters about lawn care about
pressure washing and I'm not trying to
sell you a course on how to start a
pressure washing business I'm going to
show you in a 1500w tweet how to do it
yourself and if you do it great if you
don't great I'm not incentivized if you
do that or not okay so find people that
are putting out good content encouraging
you to start businesses that are not
monetarily incentivized to get you to
start that business and that's probably
going to be a good business but that
content is hard to find mostly it's on
Twitter actually there's a lot on
YouTube because people on YouTube are
incentivized by YouTube to get more
views so YouTube can pay them they're
not most of them are not selling courses
directly so I do see really high quality
how to start a business content on
YouTube but generally speaking there is
a direct correlation between how ugly a
business is and how much profit you can
make from it whereas there's also direct

[28:01]
make from it whereas there's also direct
correlation between how sexy and passive
a business looks and how much money
you're likely to lose on it uh because
of the fact that people are simply
incentivized to make riches look very
easy as the hook so they can sell you a
course and then once you bought the
course they don't care what happens to
you they don't care if you win or lose
so those are my thoughts on
that hey how's it going good how are you
man I'm pretty good pretty good good
welcome to theer office of course so I I
want to hear about your tutoring
business and what you're struggling
with yeah so I started back in November
it started off pretty slowly I was
trying to do Facebook ads but I really
had no clue what I was doing I never
tried Facebook ads before and I was
trying to ring it but obviously that
didn't work out um so I moved into
actually going into Facebook groups so
like Mom and Dad groups school districts
and I was just saying hey I'm a college
kid and I'm I'm looking to tutor online

[29:00]
kid and I'm I'm looking to tutor online
and if anyone's interested so like that
sort of message and um so real quick you
are doing this virtually so G geography
is not a
concern right and you're doing all the
tutoring yourself or you have employees
I'm doing all myself right now okay all
right so you started joining Facebook
groups and how did that go okay I was
able to get a lot of responses and
people saying yeah I need tutoring and
you know they were responding and I get
a lot of direct messages people that
were interested in it but the
conversions on that were really low but
one thing I did notice is that when I
was able to get people on an
introduction call I was always able to
get like at least one session with them
okay and so that was your close rate is
high from your sales calls basically
yeah yeah exactly do you have any idea
of the exact percentage close rate or an
approximate in terms of like the amount
that I got on the intro calls yeah like
how many people did you convert based on
how many intro calls you had so I
probably probably
had maybe eight intro calls and I think

[30:02]
had maybe eight intro calls and I think
seven out of the eight I was able to
like at least do some you know some
people I was able to get as consistent
customers for like months at a time but
others it was like one and then they
didn't schedule another one after that
so of of the seven how many would you
say were ended up being recurring versus
the oneoff about four of them I was able
to I tuted them for probably about two
months okay um because I started back in
November so like obviously the school
year ended and not really doing it right
now but yeah trying to prepare for the
next year and then how much are you
charging and then how often are your
lessons so like H how much revenue does
a two-month long customer represent to
you so a two- Monon customer saw I would
do about one to two sessions a week and
they would be 30 minute sessions and I
would charge $24.99 for those half hour
sessions and so that would I would
probably make roughly
2550 every month okay so 20 25 bucks for
half an hour twice a week for a couple
months yeah yeah have you ever

[31:01]
months yeah yeah have you ever
experimented with your pricing at
all no I I pretty much had the same
pricing structure throughout the whole
time and I was also one thing that I
also want to change going into next year
I was hoping to get some advice on this
I was charging the same price like
regardless of the group that I was
tutoring so like high school middle
school I was charging the same price and
I looking back on that probably wasn't
that good of an idea yeah yeah when you
go in are you able to acquire customers
outside of these Facebook groups or has
that been your only way so I did get one
through well I got two through like word
of mouth and like recommendations from
someone who I was already tutoring and I
got like one more from like a
recommendation from like my mom's friend
some that sort of deal okay but mostly
Facebook groups yeah yeah what is your
pitch in the Facebook groups what do you
say to them yeah so I haven't pulled up
here actually so it says hello parents
I'm a first year student at you and I'm
a virtual tutor if your child could use

[32:00]
a virtual tutor if your child could use
some help in algebra geometry or any cap
through 12 math concepts feel free to
send me a message I have availability
every day of the week and I'd love to
help so that was the message I would
send out to the groups and yeah that
same message every time have you played
around with it at all yeah well I would
say like hello parents of insert town
okay but that was pretty much the most I
would do with that and so are you in
Seattle
then no I'm in I'm in St Louis oh okay
okay and it's Washington University yeah
Washington University in okay not
University of Washington in yeah not not
University was and are you posting in
Facebook groups that are geographically
nearby or
no uh I did yeah I I did posting a lot
that were nearby I sort of started in in
this area and then I just went
everywhere you can probably look up a
random School District Facebook group
but I see my post in there yeah yeah
okay now what was the call to action at
the end again were you asking them to DM
you yeah I said feel free to send me a

[33:01]
you yeah I said feel free to send me a
message I have availability every day of
the week and I'd love to help okay and
do people ever
comment yeah yeah I get a lot of
comments from people just asking
questions like how much does it cost you
know like I it online well I some people
would ask that even though it's said
online but okay there people inquiring
about what subjects I was doing and so
the the first thing I would do I think
you're doing a lot of stuff right I I
like that you're even though you're
virtual you're posting nearby because
they have that Affinity to you I like
that you're saying you're a college
student because people want to support
that I think the fact that you're
closing 90% of your calls means that you
you could be charging a lot more and you
might be able to make twice as much for
doing the same amount of work I imagine
these calls don't take that long they
probably just want to like right like 10
minutes yeah they just want to make sure
you're a real person that you sound and
seem nice right I would have your call
to action be more incentivizing for them
to comment because Facebook loves
comments now I know people are
commenting but if you just call to

[34:02]
commenting but if you just call to
action them to comment instead of DM you
it will it will tell face the Facebook
group groups algorithm that whatever
you're saying is more interesting than
average and it will it will because you
know like I own Facebook groups and I'll
post something really interesting and
Facebook will only show it to 5% of the
group members but as people start
commenting they will naturally start
showing it to more and more oh okay
gotcha I didn't know that's how that
worked yeah yeah they'll say oh this is
interesting more people might want to
see this so try try to incentivize
comments definitely raise your prices I
would basically also put some sort of
sense of urgency in there where it's
like hey like I just had a cancellation
I've got a couple slots I still need to
fill they they usually go pretty fast as
opposed to saying I've got all the time
in the world it's like well how good is
he if he has all the time in the world
you know yeah definitely like I have two
slots left and it's like oh oh I gotta I
gotta do something you know right or I
would also take I think what subjects

[35:01]
would also take I think what subjects
are you tutoring for specifically so I
do it's mainly math so I'll do Algebra
geometry pre-calculus ET okay so a
couple more ideas are you listed on any
marketplaces because I know there are
some marketplaces that match tutors with
parents are you on any of them yeah I
was on one called tutors.com you can
pretty much pay for leads and you know
like you'll pay like a $20 flat fee or
whatever and then they'll have someone
message you that's looking for a tutor
that's cool okay so I would definitely
recommend look for other Niche tutoring
marketplaces do you have an upwork
account no I don't I would definitely
make an upwork account because you can
you know you'll pay upwork five to
acquire a customer but then you can pull
them off upwork so you don't have to pay
any fees and have them as a recurring
customer that's how I found my son a
tutor I I just thought to go to upwork
most people don't do that but I think
there is a self- selection in there
where people that are like posting to
upwork
are like more white collar maybe more

[36:00]
are like more white collar maybe more
able to pay you more per hour right
right I would also go to all those
marketplaces all those platforms for
tutors and try to reverse engineer them
by seeing like you click the drop down
like subjects what do they have listed
first because I guarantee you whatever
they're listing first is the most
popular I feel like algebra is one of
the most sought-after subjects and then
in your Facebook post you can take that
data and lead with that this the the
subjects that are the most maybe not
math but more granular like geometry
algebra or whatever it is algebra 1
Algebra 2 or go into other Facebook
groups for parents and start searching
for words like algebra math geometry and
find Facebook groups for parents that
aren't local but have like hundreds of
thousands of people just because you're
going to use those to try to get data
and just search for specific terms
language arts Math Science and see which
ones are appearing the most often same
with next next door same strategy on on
next door what are parents asking for

[37:02]
next door what are parents asking for
the most and then in the comments of
those post what are people complaining
about and what are their pain points
what are their biggest pain points and
then lead with those in your local
Facebook groups that might only have
5,000 people in them right okay gotcha
yeah yeah that makes a lot sense yeah
yeah I think you're on the right track
with Facebook groups because there are
unlimited amounts of those and it
doesn't you could do it all over the
world right so once you hone in that
process and know all right if I'm in a
red state I'm GNA post about this if I'm
in a blue state I'm gonna like you're
going to learn so many different little
tactics to where you'll be hiring people
to help fill all that demand okay so you
recommend I like I wait till I I sort of
fill up a lot of sessions and then start
delegating the the tutoring to other
people yes yeah you want you want to be
like drowning in work before you really
start hiring other people because then
that's when you're going to be forced to
learn all these scaling
mechanisms right okay that makes a lot
of sense yeah man okay well I'm excited

[38:00]
of sense yeah man okay well I'm excited
I want to hear how it goes yeah
absolutely thank you so much for the
advice yeah it's very helpful no problem
Luke good luck thank you y see you have
a good
one this person says I'm very interested
in Ai and the potential you see with it
is there any practical use case or idea
you have about starting a business
related to AI whether it be an AI agency
implementation into existing service
businesses teaching people AI automation
integration with zapier slake in essence
if you were to force to make money start
a business related around AI what would
you do specifically if you have limited
capital A lot of free time but the
ability to learn no code software and
technical things thanks great question
here's what I would do I would help
business owners and individuals make
llms language learning models
specifically from their email accounts
there's a big hole in the market and I
think eventually it's going to get
filled with Google or open aai but right
now these big companies are very afraid

[39:01]
now these big companies are very afraid
to tie AI to our inboxes because of the
privacy concerns around that but there
are a dozen ways to throw something
together and so anytime I see an
industry that's emerging where people
are finding creative hacks and
workarounds to put something together
that's usually a really big opportunity
and so I think there's a world where you
could approach people like me that has
an inbox which with lots of data in it
for instance I raise money for RV parks
and in one of my inboxes Chris coof
founders.com that's the only one I use
to email with potential investors or
current investors and they ask all of
the same questions 15 to 20 questions
how does bonus depreciation work what's
the minimum investment size I would love
for someone that could go into my inbox
export all those emails and I've done
this myself it's grind it is possible
but it takes a long time and then it
takes a long time to learn how to
interact act with that on a regular
basis anyway someone that could take all

[40:00]
basis anyway someone that could take all
of my emails and segregate out the ones
that are only with investors and I don't
want a chatbot I want basically a
repository of answers where I could just
plug in answers anytime an potential
investor asks that question I think
there's a world where you can do that at
a service as a
service primarily to businesses that
have employees that are all asked the
same types of questions chat Bots have
been around they are around but this is
different you need like you can make
FAQs out of your inbox or something
something like that but I also really
like the idea of automation agencies
charging $2 to $3,000 a month to
basically be that person that company
calls on anytime they need an automation
made maybe the automation doesn't use AI
at all maybe uh it does so for Texas
snacks I built this thing that will
automatically email customer customers
the day that their package arrives and
then when they email them it'll even

[41:01]
then when they email them it'll even
include a tidbit about the city that
they live in so it does not look AI
generated and it has really increased
our repeat order rate because people
feel like they're creating a one-on-one
relationship with the brand whereas
usually when Brands send emails it's
full color splashy looks very
professional but it's not personal at
all and I think email is moving away
from that so to answer your question I
see two things help craft llms from from
Ai and make the the data in those llms
very accessible and just automation
agencies that may use Ai and may not
because most small to medium-sized
companies have automation needs but they
can't afford or they can't even justify
hiring someone that costs 6 to $110,000
a month they'd much rather pay you
$2,000 a month maybe 4,000 the first
month and then $1,500 ongoing to fix
things as they break because they will
break thanks for joining us on the ker
office today hope you you learned a
bunch and I hope you subscribe and share
with a friend and we'll see you next

[42:01]
with a friend and we'll see you next
time
