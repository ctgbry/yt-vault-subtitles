look at this freaking thing right here
this thing going on behind me gave me a
brilliant business idea that you don't
need much money to start day 18 of
showing you 202's best business ideas
follow for more everyone wants to own an
Airbnb but it's quite expensive and it's
quite saturated so how can you use that
fact to your advantage a don't buy an
Airbnb B monetize the fact that they're
oversaturated here's what you're going
to do you're going to go to vero.com and
airbnb.com and you're going to start
looking at listing preferably in your
area that don't have a fancy mural on
their wall like this one does and if
it's oversaturated then you have to
stand out you have to be creative and
unique and a lot of Airbnb owners don't
know how to do that so what am I
advising you to do I'm advising you to
start a business that literally installs
unique hipster murals on Airbnb walls
you mark up the mural and you mark up
your labor and it's a brilliant offer
because the Airbnb owner can charge more
for their listing and or get more
occupancy out of their listing for a
small onetime investment it's a win-win
you know how to cold Outreach to them
because you see their listing you know
they're a potential customer cuz you see
their ugly bare walls learn how to do
this on your own wall find a
manufacturer supplier and Alibaba at
wholesale you don't need to paint these
you don't need to be an artist get my
