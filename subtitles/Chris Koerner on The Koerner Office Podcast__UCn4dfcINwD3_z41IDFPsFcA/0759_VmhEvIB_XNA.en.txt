[00:00]
This guy Joe, he started with nothing.
Over 13 days, he made 1,200 bucks
without knowing anything. He started
buying more. He did $17,300
in sales this month. Start small. Make
some mistakes. Figure it out. Mike
doesn't buy anything. [music] Mike gets
everything for free and does this on the
site. He's going to make 5600 bucks on
this within 24 hours. [music] He's made
about 40 grand this year so far. It
doesn't take much to make money.
&gt;&gt; $2.99 for a rug.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. For 67 units. You bought $11,000
worth of rugs for 200 bucks. She bought
two pallets of books for a dollar. She
sold them for $5,000 [music] on eBay.
Pouring products can make you rich
because they get ignored by everybody.
All right, you guys know Shann Gene by
now. He's my good friend. He's been on
the podcast a million times cuz you guys
love him. And today he walked through
exactly how to go from flipping free $0
couches on Facebook Marketplace to
buying welding trucks, helicopters, etc.
So, in other words, how to start with $0
and end with $100,000. and he shares a
screen and walks us through actual
auctions and the prices on these things
are just mind-boggling. Please enjoy and

[01:01]
are just mind-boggling. Please enjoy and
share with a friend.
&gt;&gt; I'm thrilled to be back. I love talking
about this stuff. I want to go shopping
like we always do. We can talk about
some auctions and reselling and
opportunities, but I I want to have a
today we're going to talk about a path
like from zero, you know, investment to
scaling and then buying things and then
turning it. So, it's like in the
beginning I'm going to share a seller
with you that, you know, invests
nothing. has made like $40,000 this this
year. And then at the end, we'll we'll
talk about a seller that is, you know,
doing like $17,000 a month buying and
selling things out of his garage. So, so
all that. But I want to I want to start
I want to talk about why you have to
research first and buy second. And and I
know it's not as sexy as buying buying
buying, which I love to do too, and I
can't stop, but I want to talk about it.
There's just four pieces of this
research thing I want to go over before
we start. So, because the worst thing I
get is people like, "I listened to you,
then I went and bought all this stuff.
Now, what do I do?" Because then they
have to dig them out.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, let me interrupt you for a

[02:00]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, let me interrupt you for a
second. Some of that might be my fault,
right? [laughter]
One of my catchphrases is like the
building of the thing is the research,
right? The building of the product is
the research. But let me asterisk that.
When we're talking about sending $2,800
to Washington State for a bunch of
broken treadmills,
&gt;&gt; that's kind of a different story, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. We don't want to gamble. We want
to take calculated risks, right? This is
not rolling the dice. Now, as you do it,
you'll get more comfortable and you
won't have to do as much research
because you'll know, oh, that I know
those treadmills are worth X or
whatever. So,
&gt;&gt; yeah,
&gt;&gt; the thing is is trying to find what
sells in your market. That's the first
one. Are you selling on eBay, whatnot,
Poshmark, or are you selling on Facebook
Marketplace? You need to know what sells
there in that research. That's number
one. Just start looking around. Who's
the top sellers in in categories maybe
that you're interested in. Then you have
to study. You know, I always say don't
watch Netflix, watch auctions, but you
know, [clears throat] watch what other

[03:00]
know, [clears throat] watch what other
people are doing. And and today I'm
going to show you how to go search
somebody's Facebook marketplace just to,
you know, get some feedback on see what
they're selling. eBay, Poshmark, use
incognito mode in your browser and log
into Facebook so you can just kind of
see what they filter to the top for you
and what your competitors, best
practices, what people are doing.
&gt;&gt; And then I always ask people what's your
unfair advantage? And what I mean by
that is like what differentiates you. Do
you have extra space? Do you have a
warehouse, a barn? That's a huge unfair
advantage to somebody that's just
selling in your garage or a storage
space. Maybe you have a couple of big
teenage kids that can help you move
scratch and dent appliances around.
That's another one that's massive.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Or you know something like
&gt;&gt; I'm not a huge mechanical guy. So maybe
you know all about fixing small
mechanical things like
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; snowblowers or pressure washers. That's
great.
&gt;&gt; My takeaway from what you're saying
right now is everyone has an unfair
advantage. They just they're underelling
themselves or they're not being creative
enough. Like if you use chat GPT's like

[04:00]
enough. Like if you use chat GPT's like
video feature, you have an unfair
advantage. I use it to fix my lawn
mower. Oh, I did it. I just used it.
Yeah, I used it to fix a washer up one
of our vacation rentals this last
weekend. It's amazing.
&gt;&gt; And I'm like the least mechanically
inclined person ever. That could be an
unfair advantage. I have a teenage boy.
You're telling me that's an unfair
advantage? Awesome.
&gt;&gt; That is an unfair advantage. What your
network is. So, think of it as your
competitive edge, right? What do you
have? And it's to your point, you have
to stop and think about it because it's
not, you know, there everybody has
something that they can leverage. We're
looking for leverage here, right? to to
exponentially help you succeed. And then
you match those products to your what
your advantages are. If you're a single
person with a tiny little garage, don't
sell appliances, right? They're too
heavy and you can't get them around. But
if you know everything about luxury
products and fashion, you should be
buying from like the Japanese auction
houses and selling that product. So, it
just depends that that kind of gives you
a guide. Okay. So, so this is where I
start. And you got to just take a little
bit of time so you don't wind up having

[05:01]
bit of time so you don't wind up having
problems. But the other option is we're
going to talk about Mike McCabe real
quick. And you know this guy, you follow
him on on X. I think Mike doesn't buy
anything. Mike gets everything for free.
Mike takes couches. Mike is a weatherman
and does this on the side. See a picture
of him in this suit right here. He's at
work and he went and picked up a couch
on his break. He's going to make five,
six hundred bucks on this within 24
hours. Dude, Shannon, I'm I'm
interviewing a guy from Instagram and
he's he's a full-time couch flipper in
Canada. So, come back about a week from
now and I'll have a whole episode
dedicated to couch flipping.
&gt;&gt; This is such a great way to start
because
&gt;&gt; Mike just picks his stuff up for free or
nominal 50 bucks, you know, sometimes
for people put a couch and then he
&gt;&gt; takes time-lapse video of him cleaning
it and getting it all prepped. He's
learned how to do upholstery. His unfair
advantage is he's willing to put himself
out there. He bought an upholstery
repair kit off Amazon. He sews up when
there's tears and rips. He doesn't let
any of that stuff stop him. And he flips

[06:01]
any of that stuff stop him. And he flips
stuff every single day. And I know he's
made about 40 grand this year so far.
&gt;&gt; And he's a weather anchor.
&gt;&gt; Yes. So, you know,
&gt;&gt; and his main thing I always ask people
too what their noble cause is like we
all want to make money, but what's
higher level than that? Oh, I want to,
you know, my spouse not to work or I
want to send my kids to private school
or whatever. something you can, you
know, that you keep in your mind. Mike's
was he was just kind of bored. He's
like, you know, I'm in my mid-50s. I've
never done anything like this before.
And it's reinvigorated his life.
Whenever I talked to him, he's just
like, I'm so excited. This is the
greatest thing ever.
&gt;&gt; You got to find a higher cause. It's
like, sure, we're just selling couches.
And if you tell that to some, I don't
know, professional guy, they'd be like,
well, that's stupid. You know,
[clears throat] but it's just
&gt;&gt; it changes your life if you think about
it the right way and you put the So now
he's starting to do other things. He's
starting to do carpet and he's starting
to do some other deals. So, this going
to lead to something greater than him.
So, I love this concept here. Another
one that's basically free is this is

[07:01]
one that's basically free is this is
Mindy. She bought two pallets of books
from Gov Deals for a dollar and over 3
months she sold them for $5,000 on eBay.
&gt;&gt; What?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. This is what happens. And this is,
believe it or not, 67% of the people
that watch my YouTube videos don't
subscribe to me. And over 90% think that
they're subscribed to me. So, do me a
quick favor and check that you're
subscribed to me. If you're not, please
do. It would mean a lot.
&gt;&gt; This is Mindy's eBay account, okay?
&gt;&gt; And you can go find it. And look at, you
know, this book, $45 bucks. So, all all
these books she happened to buy were
This is a great category, too.
Homeschooling and education.
&gt;&gt; $68 for this reading thing. 52.
&gt;&gt; I'm guessing that [clears throat] books
are not a sexy category on gov deals. No
one else wanted.
&gt;&gt; That's what makes them great. Boring
products can make you rich because they
get ignored by everybody. I just feel
like the average Gov deals buyer is like
sophisticated. They're savvy. They know
what sells. And so, and even I'm an
optimist. If I see a pallet of books for
a dollar, I'm thinking, "Oh, there's no
opportunity here because my my

[08:01]
opportunity here because my my
competitive biders know there's no
opportunity here." Yeah, that's right.
But that's not true.
&gt;&gt; No. And she manages and she's still got
a ton of product to sell. So, I you
know, these are just [snorts] easy. Take
a picture, list it, go. There's nothing
that's going to break, nothing wrong. It
is what it is. You know, you use that
inexpensive media mail to ship them out
to people. But this is what you this is
how you research. You find it. Okay.
Gee, there's some books. What do I
recognize on the pallet? I'm going to go
look on eBay. This is all her sold
listings. This is not stuff that's
that's just for sale. These are these
are her sold listings.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And and now she's out on the on the
prowl for more books. That's how you
figure it out. You start She spent a
dollar and she went and picked this
stuff up. It's it's just I love it. It
was it was near her, so she just no
shipping.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, no shipping. She drove a pickup
truck.
&gt;&gt; Okay. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; And went and picked it up. So, there's
two examples that you can start with
basically zero, right? It's only your
time and action. And the stuff you can
get into for nothing. And so, we're

[09:00]
get into for nothing. And so, we're
going to walk you through this. We're
going to keep going it and and we're
going to spend a little bit more money,
but we're going to stay on gov deals
because I love gov deals. And like you
said, and this is a category I know
nothing about, which is like restaurant
equipment, commercial food, but I happen
to know somebody in this in this
business, and I know these Hobart mixers
sell for 4 to $5,000 like every time
because because they always break and
people need to buy them, and they cost
more money to repair, and they sell on
Gov deals for about 500 bucks over maybe
a thousand over and over and over. So,
if you had those connections, and I'm
not saying you should go buy this mixer,
but if you have connections in the
restaurant business industry, this is
the kind of niche or niche categories
that perform really well because
everyone else ignores them.
&gt;&gt; There are no bids on this yet. This is
just sitting here. 500 bucks is our
opening bid. This one has eight days, so
you got plenty of time. You don't even
need a resale permit to be up here. You
could just pay the tax if you want. What
are the chances of stuff like this

[10:00]
are the chances of stuff like this
having no reserve?
&gt;&gt; This has no reserve.
&gt;&gt; Oh, it shows you.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it would say reserve not met.
&gt;&gt; Wow. Okay.
&gt;&gt; There's no reserve on a lot of this
stuff.
&gt;&gt; Give or take roughly what percentage of
stuff on gov deals has a reserve versus
no reserve?
&gt;&gt; I want to say maybe less than 20% has
reserves.
&gt;&gt; Wow. Oh, so people go to gov deals when
they like their their BATNA their best
alternative to a negotiated agreement
aka plan B is like [laughter]
&gt;&gt; I have to that's what I learned from
TCU. That's what 100 grand got me.
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; But like their their their plan B is
they are going to have to pay someone to
come get this like a junk removal
company. So why would they reserve?
&gt;&gt; And this is a public school district.
&gt;&gt; So what you'll find is the school
district. So you can see their other
stuff like if you want to see the other
things that sell they're selling. Here's
some more mixers, right? Here's all
kinds of stuff like chair, you know, not
very much. They just need to get rid of
this stuff. you know, they probably have
some rule or law that says, "Hey, you
have to put it in auction. You can't
just sell it to your buddy and that kind
of thing." So, Gov Deals is just an

[11:01]
of thing." So, Gov Deals is just an
amazing place to start and to just
research because there's hundreds of
categories and and thousands and
thousands of items that you can find
right around where you are. It's
incredible.
&gt;&gt; You told me everything I needed to know
about the sophistication of the seller
when you said it's it's a school
district, right?
&gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. And there's
cool stuff up here, too. Look at this
thing. This is a motorcycle simulator. I
have no idea. But the great part is
they've took lousy pictures. You can't
even really tell. This is
&gt;&gt; a picture of a picture.
&gt;&gt; It's a picture of a picture. There's
some I can see some handlebars. I don't
know what it does, but it's only 160
bucks, right? And it's sitting in
Mazeville, North Carolina. That's the
town or whatever. Motorcycle simulator
works, but police department use it for
training and events.
&gt;&gt; That sounds awesome to me. I would love
to have that to have at an event or put
it at something. Maybe I could put it to
my Airbnb and let people sim how
&gt;&gt; or sell it to someone with an Airbnb.
&gt;&gt; I would I would screenshot that bad boy,
throw it to Chat GBT and say, "What is
this and what's it worth?"

[12:01]
this and what's it worth?"
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.
&gt;&gt; You know,
&gt;&gt; I can imagine it's thousands or tens of
thousands of dollars.
&gt;&gt; It has to be.
&gt;&gt; It's got to be. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Should we do that right now?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's do it.
&gt;&gt; I want How about this? I'm going to
screenshot it. I'm going to screenshot a
picture of a picture of a picture and
I'm going to ask Chad GPT right now.
What is this motorcycle simulator and
what's it worth? New and used. All
right, so this is a screenshot of a
picture of a picture through our
recording software.
&gt;&gt; It's perfect.
&gt;&gt; I'm super curious because this is the
stuff you want to buy because they have
lousy photos. They don't have a lot of
information. But the great thing about
Gov Deals is you can contact these
people. You can ask a question. Now, I
don't like to ask questions publicly on
this because you're giving up data to
other people, but there's a phone
number.
&gt;&gt; Call Shimata Brown right here. She wants
to talk to you, dude. She will tell you
everything you need to know about this
thing. Hey, can you give me the brand
name of this? Can you do whatever. What
did JTP say?

[13:01]
did JTP say?
&gt;&gt; It first it said it's appears to be a
coin operated arcade and I said, "No, it
was used for police training."
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; And it said, "Hold on, it's it's getting
there." That's the thing is like you
have to just dig. You start pulling the
string a little bit. Dig a little
deeper. Find out these things because it
could be worth a ton. It's certainly
worth buying for 160 bucks. If you live
near Mazeville, North Carolina,
&gt;&gt; yeah,
&gt;&gt; you should go buy this.
&gt;&gt; You don't need to do any research.
&gt;&gt; Everyone listening or watching lives
near somewhere. Yes. Right.
&gt;&gt; So, if you if you have somebody and this
is it's two days, I think it's November
7th, so this may not come out by then,
but
&gt;&gt; it might be out tomorrow. I think this
might be out tomorrow, actually.
&gt;&gt; Well, that's amazing. So then there
still be a day to do it and you know
[snorts] just go to gov deals and search
for motorcycle simulator. You can find
it. I think it's great. Did GPT get
close?
&gt;&gt; Yep. It said uh it's a police motorcycle
training simulator.
&gt;&gt; The kind agencies used to teach pursuit
evasive maneuvers scanning etc. Common
makers mock or lander. It says okay here

[14:01]
makers mock or lander. It says okay here
we go. Prices are quote only but
ballpark spans several thousand to well
into the tens of thousands. Basic
training bike sims. listed are listed
for 4 to 7K. Broader motorcycle sim
ranges show up at over $100,000.
&gt;&gt; So that's you got a good range in there.
So you're safe spending.
&gt;&gt; Yes,
&gt;&gt; you you have to bid you'd have to bid
$170 bucks. That's the next bid. But
&gt;&gt; it says if it's complete and working, 5
to 15k is a realistic surplus value.
&gt;&gt; So
&gt;&gt; it's genius. How can you not love this,
right? I love it. I think it's great.
And I just spent, you know, I prepped
for this our call here. I just spent a
little time ago. I know. I'll go find
some stuff up there. And I always look
at the different categories and and poke
around. So, here's another one I really
like. These are parking pay stations,
not a parking meter. They're connected
with an app called Flowbird. And I
reached out to them this morning, and
they Oh, yeah. You can connect these
back up the They This was sold by the
state of Arkansas. These are in Okay.
&gt;&gt; Fagetville. They got a ton of them. This

[15:01]
&gt;&gt; Fagetville. They got a ton of them. This
is just one auction. This is 27 of them.
&gt;&gt; Close down a parking lot or something or
swap out their hardware.
&gt;&gt; Yep. And you can put these anywhere they
take. Right now they pulled the SIM
cards and stuff, so there's no credit
card payment, but it they're still set
up to take coins, but you don't want to
do that. You want to contact Flowbird,
which is still around. You can download
their app, and you want to get connected
and do it, but they're $100 right now.
&gt;&gt; No reserve. That they're going to close
in one day and 9 hours. And there's a
few different auctions of these. So
these are going to sell for nothing.
More than likely, they'll sell for 100
bucks. And so you could be into these
for nothing. Go pick them up, put them
in wherever you want, and turn it into a
business and you've whether you have a
parking lot, whether you have somebody
else that that wants to do it. Nobody
likes paying for parking, but everybody
pays for parking. Dude, I mean, you
could even like find an empty lot in a
city that's for sale or it's just
sitting and say, "Hey, can we do a
month-to-month lease? I want to use your
lot as a parking lot. Monthtomonth. If

[16:01]
lot as a parking lot. Monthtomonth. If
it goes well, I might want to buy it. I
might want to sign a three-year lease.
If it doesn't go well, you know, your
lot will look the exact same and you'll
make some revenue. And then you can take
these $100 things, post them up on a
cement pad, and you're in business.
&gt;&gt; I love it. This stuff, I mean, you could
spend hours up here. Like I said, I
always say, don't watch Netflix, watch
auctions. This is what I mean. You
should be looking at this stuff because
there's tons of opportunity.
&gt;&gt; I'm going to jump into selling scalable
stuff where you could buy it over and
over. But these unique things are great
money makers and it's a great way to
start because often I get, well, I don't
have any money. Okay. Well, let's go get
some couches off Facebook. Let's buy
some books. Let's get in here. Let's buy
this and scale yourself up. This is
another one I really like, too. This is
34 hotel rooms full of furniture that
they're selling.
&gt;&gt; Wow.
&gt;&gt; It's near you. Okay. It's in Fort Worth
&gt;&gt; and it's $1,500
and every room
&gt;&gt; 34 rooms full of furniture
&gt;&gt; and every room has a television.
&gt;&gt; Every room has this this chair. I
thought the couches looked
&gt;&gt; $2,000. Buy it now price. Buy it now for

[17:02]
&gt;&gt; $2,000. Buy it now price. Buy it now for
two grand.
&gt;&gt; Okay. How many pieces are we talking?
&gt;&gt; Well, if you count them up, you're like,
"Okay, there's a chair in every room."
Oh, I think it's right here. This is the
list. There's a a sofa, accent chair,
coffee table, TV stand with the 32-in
TV, two nightstands, a queen headboard,
no no mattress or frame, a dresser, a
mirror, and a table.
&gt;&gt; Okay, hold on. Okay. So, sofa, accent
chair, coffee table, TV stand, TV, two
nightstand, headboard, dresser, mirror,
small table, single chair. So, 12 * 34.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; 34 rooms, right?
&gt;&gt; 34 rooms.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, we're talking 408 items and
for a $2,000 buy it now price. So, $5
per item.
&gt;&gt; They just are trying to get somebody to
come pick it up.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's really what
&gt;&gt; Or they're going to have to pay a junk
removal company.
&gt;&gt; Correct. They're going to pay. So, you
could go by and pick this up now,
tomorrow, because it's
&gt;&gt; I could It's an hour away from me.
&gt;&gt; There you go. I could see the stuff out

[18:01]
&gt;&gt; There you go. I could see the stuff out
in your field. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; But
&gt;&gt; I don't think rain's on the forecast for
the next week or two.
&gt;&gt; Great stuff to sell. I mean, can you
sell a 34 inch TV for 50 bucks? I don't
know anymore. Maybe I don't know what
you do with them. Maybe you put four of
them together and sell it like a red
zone football sports thing where they
could watch them all at once.
&gt;&gt; Here's what you do. I'm assuming all of
these things are the same, right? Yeah.
Like it's the same dress.
&gt;&gt; They buy them all at the same time.
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, all you need is 12 Facebook
Marketplace listings, right? Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And you you put the price stupidly low
on all of them. And you put the address
in the listing and you say, "I'm going
to edit this listing as things sell out,
but if you're seeing it here, it's in
stock right now. If you message me, is
this still available?" I will not
respond to you. I won't. I love that
&gt;&gt; cuz I can't. Right. So, come to the
address. If it's up, it's in stock. Come
pick it up. Here's my Venmo. And then
you just have people come to you because
people are rightfully hesitant to want

[19:01]
people are rightfully hesitant to want
to go lug a dresser around the Dallas
Fort Worth Metroplex for $15. You don't
have to do that. Go pick all of them up
at once, drop them off at once, put up
some listings, take some pictures and
videos, and just collect the cash.
&gt;&gt; I agree.
&gt;&gt; And say, "I won't negotiate. This is the
price. This is the demo."
&gt;&gt; It's It's great. You could sell the
whole room. I'll sell the whole room for
$200, you know what I mean? Or something
like that. But this is like a 10x, maybe
not 10x, 8x, something like that. I
mean, there's Yeah, these deals. So, so
&gt;&gt; it doesn't take a lot of money and
there's a lot of upside. It all depends
how much effort you're willing to put
in. If you really want to change your
life and you really want to make that
extra cash,
&gt;&gt; this is not a side hustle. This is like
an evergreen revenue stream, right? This
is stuff that has a big impact on your
life and your kids and you know all this
kind of stuff. But you want to that you
want to build an ADU for your
mother-in-law, you know, all that stuff.
&gt;&gt; These are $5 per unit, right?
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; I think 8x is very conservative. If you
sold each one for 40 bucks, that's 8x.
So $16,000. 2,000 of that is your cost.

[20:01]
So $16,000. 2,000 of that is your cost.
You got to put your your back into it.
Maybe you got to go rent a U-Haul for,
you know, 75 cents a mile.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And you could go make multiple
runs. Put these somewhere. Like I said,
you know, maybe your unfair advantage is
you have a barn, a barn or a warehouse
or a self- storage place, you know, and
it's money, man.
&gt;&gt; But if you could sell these in two
weeks, which I think is realistic if you
price it aggressively, you boosted you
only have to boost one listing. That's
the thing.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, I did this once, Shannon. We we
moved warehouses for my my logistics
business.
&gt;&gt; I posted one Facebook Marketplace
listing and I listed out every single
thing we were selling, racks, chairs,
whiteboards, TVs, everything. I'm not
exaggerating. I got like over 10,000
clicks on that thing.
&gt;&gt; Wow.
&gt;&gt; Because it was stuffed with keywords.
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
&gt;&gt; Right. It was just stuffed. That's what
I did.
&gt;&gt; Yep. Yep.
&gt;&gt; I said they we're going to be there from
9:00 to 5:00. Here's our Venmo. Here's
the price. If you see it listed, it's
here. If you ask me if it's available,
I'm like, I'm never going to respond to
any of these. Just come pick it up
between these hours. Right. And then it

[21:00]
between these hours. Right. And then it
just became like a flea market. It's
perfect.
&gt;&gt; So if someone were to do that,
&gt;&gt; even if they just post it up in their
car at a storage facility,
&gt;&gt; two weeks time they've made $14,000
profit
&gt;&gt; and you've gathered a bunch of data from
people. You get their emails, you get
them on Facebook, say, "Hey, I'm
starting this liquidation."
&gt;&gt; Why are their emails?
&gt;&gt; Yes, I'm going to have I'm going to have
more stuff. I want to keep in touch with
you. You have them sign up when they
come in. You have an iPad or something
like that. You you know, it's a
repeatable process.
&gt;&gt; Here is a quick triedand-true business
idea for you. There is an all-in-one
platform that handles CRM, email
marketing, funnels, booking, all of it.
Everything a business needs to run and
grow. It's called Highle, but you can
completely white label your own tools
with it, which means you can rebrand the
entire thing as your own software and
sell it to local businesses. It's got a
built-in prospecting tool that pulls
local businesses, shows exactly where
they're screwing up, and then you can
pitch them the fix, find the problem,
and solve the problem on the same
platform. It's stupid easy to set up. It

[22:01]
platform. It's stupid easy to set up. It
has drag and drop builders, pre-built
templates for everything, so you're not
just starting from scratch. Then you can
charge monthly. They get their problem
solved while you build recurring
revenue. So go to gohighlevel.com/tkopod
for your first 30 days free. And this
could legitimately be your next
business. If you think someone drives 45
minutes to pick up a TV or a dresser and
you say, "All right, what's your email?
What's your phone?"
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Like they're not going to give it to
you.
&gt;&gt; They'll give it to you. Then you'll have
a database of everyone of people that
are bargain hunters.
&gt;&gt; I agree.
&gt;&gt; I'm so fired up right now.
&gt;&gt; I know, dude. This is exciting stuff.
[laughter]
It's No, there's no reason not to do it.
&gt;&gt; Real quick, please subscribe to my
channel. I know it's kind of lame to
ask, but it means a lot. Thanks.
&gt;&gt; I wanted to point this one out. This is
my friend Jim Row. He's in our
mastermind. He's a great guy. You'll see
him on X. He bought this truck off Gub
Deals for the price of the If you're not
watching this, there's a welder that's
at the top on the side of this truck. So
he figured out what the resale price of
that welder was and that's what he bid.

[23:01]
that welder was and that's what he bid.
So he bought that truck and they flipped
it within 48 hours he made $4,000.
So when you're looking at like utility
trucks are big but has that crane on the
side. That's a very these are very
expensive accessories. Like if you had
to buy that crane it's probably $4 or
$5,000 to get it on your truck and all
this kind of stuff.
&gt;&gt; He could have made more if he like broke
it all up. He just wanted to flip it.
&gt;&gt; Flipping it. He drove it home. It was up
near him. He posted about it laughing.
I'm going to try this. We're going to
get this thing going. We're just
surrounded by opportunities. So, we
started with nothing. Easy things to
flip. Now, we're getting a little more
sophisticated. Oh, I'm going to buy a
truck. Oh, I'm going to buy a mixer. Oh,
maybe I'll buy some a hotel rooms worth
of stuff.
&gt;&gt; All very accessible, especially as you
learn up, you know, as you get going.
&gt;&gt; Can I give you an analogy real quick? I
just thought of
&gt;&gt; with AI exploding, right? It's not going
to slow down anytime soon. Like let's
relate this to the stock market, right?
What happens when AI explodes? Nvidia is
now a $5 trillion company. Insane.

[24:00]
now a $5 trillion company. Insane.
Tesla's 1.3 trillion. Meta, all these AI
companies, Open AI took three years to
reach a half a trillion dollar
valuation, yada yada yada. And I'm not
even saying they're overvalued. It just
is what it is, right? AI is
transformative.
&gt;&gt; Then you got stocks like Chipotle,
McDonald's, Nike, Lululemon. Like, these
are boring. These are old stocks. like
no one cares about them anymore. And you
know, investors only have so much
capital. They only have so much money to
put into companies. So now they're like,
"Hipult is pretty boring." And Chipotle
is like, "We opened 400 stores last
year, but whatever." Exactly.
&gt;&gt; I'm [laughter] putting this money into
Nvidia, right?
&gt;&gt; And so the the analogy here is like all
of these new AI things are awesome and
like people should chase AI. I'm chasing
AI. You're probably using AI in your
business. Yep. But that just means the
amount of eyeballs looking at like a a
Ford F450 to make four grand on is
fewer. There's fewer eyeballs because
they're looking at the Nvidas of the
world, right?
&gt;&gt; Boring products can make you rich.
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; there's no doubt about it. Over and over

[25:00]
&gt;&gt; there's no doubt about it. Over and over
and over. And I'm going to show you
another boring category that's amazing
right now
&gt;&gt; and that's rugs. This category is
because the same kind of thing. Nobody
pays attention to it because it's like I
don't want to sell rugs. But we might
have talked about this show before. It's
not a product you think about.
&gt;&gt; No. Right. It's not.
&gt;&gt; It kind of reminds me of what you say
about electronics like avoid. Avoid
because everything on them can break.
It's the thing that's top of mind,
right? Oh, I have an iPhone. Everyone
has an iPhone. I'm going to flip
iPhones. No. What are you not thinking
about? The thing under your feet. The
rug that you replace every eight years,
right? That's what you should be buying.
&gt;&gt; That's right. So, you really need to
know your local market. In some areas,
people have carpet in their houses, most
people, and so the rugs are not that
great. But other places everybody has
tile or wood floors or whatever and
carpets are very popular. What also
makes them very popular is that some
these higherend brands like Ruggable,
they created a system to take the
backing off the rug so you could throw
the rug in the washer. Big big deal.
That changed everything. And the and
they sell the rugs for like 500 bucks.

[26:00]
they sell the rugs for like 500 bucks.
So when you look at these this category
you have
&gt;&gt; and these auction just just closed. So
this when when I pulled them up an hour
ago, they were just closing. So these
are the real final numbers. Here's 8,847
worth of rugs for 500 bucks. So five 6%
of the Costco. These are Costco rugs.
Costco price. This one 10,600
sold for 200 bucks. 1.89% of the Costco
price. Okay, that's 67 units. So it
doesn't take much to make money on this
this product. And it's great because
when you get these things, you're going
to roll them out. These are customer
returns. You're going to run a vacuum on
them, but you're not going to do
anything until you set up your iPhone
and time lapse and showing you vacuuming
it. Some of them you might even have to
steam clean it. You're going to show
them doing that as well. And that is the
first thing people are going to see when
they're scrolling through Facebook
Marketplace. They're going to see your
stuff. They're going to see your
time-lapse stuff. Just like your stump
grinding stuff, it stops the scroll. You

[27:00]
grinding stuff, it stops the scroll. You
want to find that stuff that stops the
scroll. And this category can be very
profitable mainly because it's so
inexpensive to buy because you're buying
for less than 5% of the Costco price
which is already discounted. And so when
you want to do the research, you jump
into Facebook Marketplace. So I look for
stuff like this cuz this is a stock
photo. Okay. Oh, 8x10 washable non-slip
rug. And I go and look at the seller and
this woman here has 76 feedback. So I'm
like, okay, so she's selling. So let's
&gt;&gt; she knows what she's doing.
&gt;&gt; She knows she know she's selling. So
then I bring up her profile. Kind of
looks like a a mug shot. And then I I
[laughter] want to go look at what she's
got. This is what she's selling now.
Lots of rugs. 60 bucks, 70 bucks.
&gt;&gt; But I also really want to look at what
sold out. What
&gt;&gt; I've never done this before. I've never
gone to like the sellers page. Is Is
that new or am I just outdated here?
&gt;&gt; Uh I don't know if it's new. I've always
done it. And then I scrape it. I use
instant data scraper and I scrape this.
And so you're creating the market. So
she hasn't sold a rug. You know, this is

[28:00]
she hasn't sold a rug. You know, this is
a rug 20 bucks. 5x8's an outdoor rug.
This is, you know, okay, patio rug, but
there's one 60 bucks. I mean, and she's
got all kinds of other stuff here. I
know she's selling returns. You can just
I can sense it. You know, a hallway
runner, 25 bucks. So, you're buying
those rugs at what is this? This is
$299. $3.
&gt;&gt; $2.99 for a rug.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. For 67 units. You bought $11,000
worth of rugs for 200 bucks. This one
here is $6 per unit. 8 grand for $624.
Right? So, so let's just say you're
under 10 bucks per rug. Well under, but
be conservative. And the big ones, but
you see what they sell. Here's 50 bucks
for a 6 by9. 8 by10s are the most
popular. Here's 30. Here's this kind of
stuff. But you don't have to make have
to make a big investment. And this is
your proof. And if this was your town,
your city, your hyper local market, this
is how you find out what they're
selling. Yeah. what's selling? What's
selling up here and who's doing it? And

[29:00]
selling up here and who's doing it? And
you know, you could reach out and talk
to this this woman and ask her
questions. But that's how you create the
market. That's how do and then I like I
mentioned use instant data scraper to
scrape that data off. You make a
spreadsheet, you build it out that way.
So I love that concept. Boring products,
man, make you rich.
&gt;&gt; Oh man, [sighs]
&gt;&gt; that's so good.
&gt;&gt; And so this guy Joe, he's awesome. He
started with nothing. That's his first
pallet he ever bought of pressure
washers. He invested 1,50. He took him
two, this was his first deal he ever
bought earlier this year. Over 13 days,
he made 1,200 bucks net profit just
without knowing anything. Didn't know
anything. As he started to grow, he
started buying more. Buying more. Joe
has sold over 700 pressure washers so
far this year
&gt;&gt; in Sacramento.
&gt;&gt; Yep. because he figured out he partnered
with a couple of guys to help him with
repairs
&gt;&gt; and
&gt;&gt; yeah,
&gt;&gt; he figured out what was going on. These
are his sales. Here we go. He started
with nothing. Up, up, up, up, up, up,

[30:00]
with nothing. Up, up, up, up, up, up,
up. In August, he had a hard time
getting inventory or maybe went on
vacation, whatever. And now he's back up
in October. So, this is almost 17. And I
think I have a screenshot. He did
$17,300
in sales this month in October. This is
because we're rolling in November. Last
three months he's done $42,000. He
started
&gt;&gt; Oh my gosh.
&gt;&gt; Go back. He spent a thousand bucks and
bought this pallet and figured out this
game and he's just leaning into it and
now he's selling other stuff. He's
selling he bought a truckload of patio
furniture and so, you know, but he only
spent the truckload was like $5,000. And
so he sold that truckload. He he was in
the black within less than two days. 36
hours of receiving it. he was in the
black and and turned and flipped that.
Now he's selling all kinds of stuff, you
know. So that's the the road map here.
The runway, you know, start small, make
some mistakes, figure it out. What do
you like to sell? I don't want to sell
rugs. Okay, what else is next? Sell
Blackstones, you know, whatever you
want.
&gt;&gt; I think it's terrific.

[31:00]
&gt;&gt; I think it's terrific.
&gt;&gt; It seems like there's nothing too niche.
Like, could you imagine someone saying
like, "What do you do for a living? I'm
an optometrist. What about you? I own a
restaurant. What about you? I sell
pressure washers in Sacramento."
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Like what? used sometimes needing to be
repaired.
&gt;&gt; Absolutely. Yeah. I make 15 grand a
month selling used pressure washers only
to people that live in Sacramento.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; And I work and I work like two hours a
day
&gt;&gt; and I have my kids and I go to every
sporting event and I never miss anything
and my kids are helping me and this.
Yes. It's amazing. It mentally that's
that's a big struggle that as you
mentioned that because people want to be
defined, right? That's why when people
say what do you do? When I was younger,
I was like, I don't how do I tell this
guy, you know, what I do because I do
all this crazy stuff. And it didn't
matter that I might have made more money
than him. I felt inferior because I
didn't have this label, you know, but
&gt;&gt; now I know that it's better not to be,
you know, be hard to define. It's
better. So I I just say, "Oh, I I own

[32:01]
better. So I I just say, "Oh, I I own
some small businesses." That that's what
I always say.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. you know, and then I meet if
I meet somebody like you, then you just
dive deep into the way. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So, this is another one.
This is this this auction ends in three
minutes as we're recording this.
&gt;&gt; This is the right time to buy exercise
equipment. Absolutely. January 1 coming
up.
&gt;&gt; January is coming up. This is a
truckload. It's 15 units. So, that means
they're putting each unit on a pallet
because they're, you know, to protect
it. Customer returns from Costco about
$16,000 worth of exercise equipment. It
says used good. So, they're good
customer returns. The bids at $276
right now.
&gt;&gt; And it ends in two minutes.
&gt;&gt; It ends in three minutes and 10 seconds.
And no one else is going to bid. It's
going to
&gt;&gt; We're going to see.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. We'll see.
&gt;&gt; And now there's freight. Got a whole
truckload. So, this to get this to me is
like 2,600 bucks. So, that's your real
cost, right? So, you're
&gt;&gt; Where's it coming from? Ontario, Canada.
&gt;&gt; California.
&gt;&gt; So, LA.
&gt;&gt; LA. Yeah. I I said Canada. I meant
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.

[33:00]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But they're all over the US. So you want
to buy near you to try to save on
because that's a actually a pretty good
rate for 15 pallets for 2,600 bucks. But
so you have 15 units. So you're into it
for what? Because I don't do math in
public.
&gt;&gt; 200 bucks each.
&gt;&gt; 2603. Yeah. Plus 276. So 2879
divided by 15. 190 bucks. $191.
Well, so this is real important, too.
You want to always have a manifest. They
tell you exactly what you're going to
get. Look, this Nordic Track treadmill
is 2500 bucks. That's a Costco price.
Other stores sell it for more. Nordic
Track probably sells it for three grand.
[snorts] This is his ProForm trainer.
It's 1,400. There's nothing on this list
less than $600. 2500, 1,400,
1,200,000,000,000,000.
Most of them are a,000 bucks, $8.99,
$6.99. So, yeah, you're going to get
some stuff that's that's broken. There's
no doubt. A lot of people mess this
stuff up or they're heavy and it gets
kind of broken. But how many items do
you have to sell to get your 2,800 bucks

[34:01]
you have to sell to get your 2,800 bucks
back? One, two.
&gt;&gt; I just went to Facebook Marketplace in
DFW, typed in Costco Nordic Track, and
they're going from $700 to $900 on
Facebook Marketplace used.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I love it. And here, you know, you
get to look. The other thing that's
really nice is with with Costco
especially, they have pictures of every
single thing and they're labeled four of
15, five, so you can, you know, zoom in
on these photos to get some condition
information. And I go and I do these
coaching sessions at all time where I
point out, don't buy this load because
of this. See how they stack that? That's
not good. See the dining room table?
They stack that upside down and all the
chairs on top of it. The top is going to
be scratched. You know, that kind of
thing. But if it's in the box, it's
different. In the box is great. It's
protected.
&gt;&gt; Quick question. What if there were a
private community out there of people
that were building businesses based on
this podcast? Well, I just made it and
it's only for business starters and
business builders. It's called TK
owners, and it's basically like having
me and a hundred other business geniuses
as your business partner. Also, there's

[35:01]
as your business partner. Also, there's
going to be exclusive new trends, growth
hacks, business ideas, and a database of
everything I've ever talked about.
You'll find thousands of startup case
studies. You'll have weekly ask me
anything with me while I'll answer your
questions directly. You can join now at
tkowners.com, link in the show notes.
So, you can look at each of these items,
see if there's, you know, stuff hanging
off them or whatever. But now is the
time to buy. It's November.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You hang out. By the time you get it,
it's going to be late November, early
December, and in January hits, man,
everybody going to want to buy a
treadmill,
&gt;&gt; right?
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; So, I love these deals. It's not one of
my favorite categories because it's so
heavy and big and
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; kind of wonky to get around, but we have
people, you know, selling them all the
time in there. So, I'm kind of
reassessing my Let's go talk about the
gold and we'll come back to that thing.
So, the gold is this is 43 1oz gold
bars. Township back east has it. And uh
so they're selling this stuff. There's

[36:00]
so they're selling this stuff. There's
the 43 of these. They've had them
inspected. It's still got five days.
It's sitting at 150. Started at like I
think like 40 grand or something like
that. No, it was 19,000 and when I sent
it to you a few days ago. So, it's it's
kind of peaked out here because I think
I don't know how I don't know anything
about gold, but from what I hear,
there's still like maybe 15 grand profit
in it, something like that.
&gt;&gt; How many bars are there?
&gt;&gt; 43 1oz bars.
&gt;&gt; So, as of today, that's 168 grand worth,
but like you'd probably only get 164,
162.
&gt;&gt; So, I I don't know how you make this
deal work because there's a buyer fee on
it as well,
&gt;&gt; right? So, you're going to pay another
5%. So that's, you know, $75.
&gt;&gt; This is like a good example of like a an
an efficient market.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Because there's a set market price for
this. It's very a liquidatable.
&gt;&gt; Yes. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Very liquid.
&gt;&gt; And someone has an unfair advantage that
is going to win these that or someone's
going to be bidding with emotion, which
is a big mistake. You should be

[37:00]
is a big mistake. You should be
&gt;&gt; You know what? You know,
&gt;&gt; I'm actually putting out an episode here
soon about flipping gold from Costco.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And um I picked the guy's uh brain
at Costco about it because he was very
open. So I just kept going. You know,
isn't that the best when you're like
digging for info and they're just happy
to oblige?
&gt;&gt; He said that
&gt;&gt; a lot of their buyers are people that
make custom jewelry and people people
that are using the gold to build their
own stuff.
&gt;&gt; Genius. And it's cheaper to buy that
from them, I'm sure. Right. Than to try
to get specialized.
&gt;&gt; Costco is the cheapest gold supply
basically you can. Of course they are.
And a hot dog. Yeah, of course. Yeah.
Yeah. I love it. I love it. I bought I
bought my gold at selfch checkckout, by
the way.
&gt;&gt; Oh, you did? That's the best, dude.
&gt;&gt; They give you a ticket.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's the best.
&gt;&gt; Then you scan the ticket at selfch
checkckout and then they give you a bar
of gold and you walk out and you show
the the lady at the door.
&gt;&gt; That's perfect. I love it. I love it. I
love Costco.
&gt;&gt; It wouldn't be a talk without talking
about a helicopter, without talking
about this Blackhawk. Right. And
&gt;&gt; obviously,
&gt;&gt; yes. So, these are GSA auctions,
government services. They were out of

[38:00]
government services. They were out of
They were shut down for a little while,
but now they're back because of the shut
down. How are they shut down?
&gt;&gt; The government shut down but
&gt;&gt; this is a government website unlike gov
deals which is a privately owned
company. This is the government that
we're
&gt;&gt; you are buying from the federal
government right now. The the general
service administration handles all
buying and selling of everything. This
is an amazing site to go to. You can buy
houses up here. We looked at lighthouse
on the island last time.
&gt;&gt; I remember it was like a 100 acres or
something.
&gt;&gt; It was some I I don't know how many
acres but it was so cheap it was
ridiculous. which was a private island
with a with a 1,700 foot house on it
that sold for like 300 grand. It was
stupid.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But anyway, they just put this Blackhawk
up here. The the the starting bid is
half a million dollars, which I could be
the best deal in the world on what I
love about it is they only right now
they only have a couple of pictures,
&gt;&gt; but I think it's complete. You know,
they give you the the Sakorski thing,
the model number, VIN number, all that
kind of stuff. I love these sales. These
are great. I think it's amazing. You can
go and inspect it. There's all kinds of
aircraft information records to download
in this place. But these places are

[39:00]
in this place. But these places are
amazing and I highly recommend that you
start hanging out here. These are the
holes which I think are great Airbnbs.
There's some more aircraft. There's MREs
to always meals ready to eat if you have
connections in South America. It's
amazing. Could be an amazing
opportunity. Bottled water. If you want
to buy pallets of bottled water, boring
items can make you rich. 150 bucks.
&gt;&gt; How much are these? 150 for a pallet.
Let me see how many Let's see how many
pieces it is. I think it's more. It is
2,000 bottles. 1,920 bottles.
&gt;&gt; 150 bucks. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; What would you even do with that?
&gt;&gt; I have no idea. Sell it in my store. If
I had a retail store, if I if like we
talked about before, if you're an hour
away from a Costco,
&gt;&gt; you should be selling Costco stuff. And
like Jim Row, he's he's 90 minutes from
a Costco and he sells toilet paper and
bottled water
&gt;&gt; because people come in every every week
to get it.
&gt;&gt; And it's so he's like, "I don't make any
money on that stuff, but I just get them
in the store. They buy bottled water,
toilet paper, paper towels." He's like,
"I sell it the same price Costco does."

[40:00]
"I sell it the same price Costco does."
&gt;&gt; And I just bring it in, bring it in,
bring it in. It gets them in the store.
&gt;&gt; Wow.
&gt;&gt; So that's what I would be doing with
this stuff.
&gt;&gt; So Jim has a he has a retail store then.
&gt;&gt; He does. It's called the Barking Shop.
Okay.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. He took over. Another guy started
with nothing within a year grew went to
one started in a self- storage then went
to a tow truck place that he rented
monthto-month and now he's in a 6,000t
former Sears location. He does 3 to
5,000 a day and uh Yep. And he's he's
trying to make $1,000 700 times so he
can buy a $700,000 yacht.
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah, I remember that guy. He's on
Twitter, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. He's all these guys. I'm
because I'm like, "Hey, come over here.
Start posting this stuff. Everybody
loves it." But, uh, it's awesome. You
can have a lot of fun. There's a bunch
of great people involved in it and come
do it. We've talked about Advanced Auto
before. What happened was Pep Boys
bought them. So, whenever you hear
things about one company buying another,
you always want to connect with that.
Like when Dick Sporting Goods bought
Foot Locker, so they're blowing out
massive amounts of shoes that Foot
Locker hoarded for years because it held

[41:01]
Locker hoarded for years because it held
helped their quarterlys look better. But
then they run out of cash, right? And
then they got all this inventory. So Dix
is like, "Now we got to flood flood this
out." That's the opportunity. Same with
Pep Boys bought Advanced Auto. This is a
truckload right here. It's 9,833
units. Brand new product. The retail
price, the price that Advanced Auto
Parts sold it for was 117,441.
Okay. I watched this close. I don't have
the snapshot because they don't show it
afterwards, but this whole load sold for
1,650 bucks. 17 cents per item out of
this 9,000. And I don't I can't access
the list anymore because this was a this
was a few days ago. The manifest was all
these specialty parts. Everything at
least $100 value. So when I say that the
their biggest problem is they have to
get rid of it. That's true because this
happens every every other day. Advanced
Auto has this product that they're
selling. There's one up there. Now if I
go to if I just go back up to BTO and I

[42:00]
go to if I just go back up to BTO and I
search, there's this one right here.
This is 185,000 worth. This is there's a
generator, commercial shop equipment,
all kinds of stuff, tools, everything,
auto parts. The bid is at $9,200. So
that's $2.60 per unit. And there's 22
hours left. So they wouldn't be putting
this stuff up here letting it sell for
nothing if they didn't have a better way
to do it.
&gt;&gt; These are some of the smartest people in
the world when it comes to buying and
selling product. [snorts]
&gt;&gt; So yeah,
&gt;&gt; you have to shift your m the mindset to
I'm solving a problem for them. How do I
add value to my customer? And if you
want to make extra money, this is this
is the easiest way in my opinion to make
extra money where you're starting with
free couches or getting all the way up
to buying truckloads of auto parts and
generators and whatever it is. But I
still love that the way you try to sell
this stuff is a treasure hunt is the
best way to sell it. It's like, wow, you
don't I mean, I don't really like to
sell. So, you want to share the
opportunity. It's like, wow, I got all
this stuff. It's amazing. would you I

[43:00]
this stuff. It's amazing. would you I
have these Blackstone grills I could
sell for half price. Does that interest
you? And people are like, "Heck yeah, it
interests me. I want to buy this stuff.
How do I get it?" And then you cut them
in on it. And so one of the first things
you do if you're selling in your garage
is you get your neighbors involved so
they feel good about trucks showing up
in the front of your place. So everybody
gets a deal in your neighborhood.
Everybody gets a $100 Blackstone.
Everybody buys stuff for their kids. The
kids get free stuff. You become the hero
in your community, not the guy that
everybody's mad at because a truck shows
up at 7:00 a.m. That's part of the
strategy. So,
&gt;&gt; oh,
uh, Shannon, you've outdone yourself.
&gt;&gt; I love shopping of this stuff. I'm going
to go buy some parking meters.
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; You should should.
