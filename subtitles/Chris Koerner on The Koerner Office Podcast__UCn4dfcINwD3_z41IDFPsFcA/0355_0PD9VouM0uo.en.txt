welcome ker nerds I don't know if
anyone's here if anyone's going to be
here but it's Sunday afternoon and I
wanted to split some wood with my kids
so I thought want to go live and we'll
talk about business while we do it so if
you have any questions this is only on
YouTube live ask them maybe we'll see
them I don't know how this works I've
never done like a vertical shorts live
before this is new so if I don't answer
your questions it's either because I
forgot or I can't see them but I would
love your questions about uh tree
trimming business firewood business any
business me
life Pizza barbecue you name it so I'm
going to start splitting some wood and
worst case you get to watch some wood
being split so let's see how this
goes all
right start this bad boy
up you let you zoom at

[01:20]
all how many people are watching one
zero my mom nine we got nine people all
right
get a
shot
W
[Music]
beautiful is that
[Applause]
cool oh man

[02:02]
[Music]
so if you're just now joining us I hope
you can hear me over
this I started a firewood
business with some guys to go to church
with Kade and Devon shout out Kade and
Devon now let me be very clear
here I'm not trying to make it look like
I'm do work in this
business I just happen to live where the
business is being hosted Kate and Devon
have done about 98% of everything right
now so let's just get that out of the
way right
now do I know what I'm doing no have I
ever split with before other than like
for 10 minutes while I tested this thing
out no this is my first time
ever but this is for a
reason at some point you will see a log
fall on my foot

[03:00]
fall on my foot
that's
okay you may notice I'm wearing
Crocs that's because I was wearing Crocs
today in some ways this is very
strategic in other ways it's not at
all it's strategic in the sense that
I want to encourage people to start
businesses even if they don't know what
they're
doing because often
times you use that as an excuse to not
start to not do to not
[Music]
act so what may look is foolishness from
the
outside is a partial foolishness and to

[04:00]
outside is a partial foolishness and to
buy us for
Action we don't let
insecurities prevent us from
starting can you zoom in on the
rod a little Double Split here
huh little Double
Split I call this the
duplex duplex to a fourplex
good looking wood Good
Wood you want to show the
wood let's stack everything we got from
this one
log that's still real big I'm gonna
stack everything from this one log here

[05:04]
what's up 52 people here show me the
camera we got 52 people here it's

should we

[06:01]

do and
then it just so
happens that on this camp out we have a
wood splitter just like this
one so we said why not follow
it I said I've got a tree trimming
business you get to work for
free I live on a few Acres

HOA we can store no water on my
property it was perfect it was meant to

[Applause]
[Music]
all right it will it will
split all you know let's go against the
grain I'm an Against the Grain kind of
guy so it works look at
[Music]
that you know what's going to happen
there too much special is going to fly
up hit me in the
face going thought it was cool and all
that but I'm not that

[08:01]
okay we're not doing against the gra
maybe with pine pine is a soft wood this
is a hardwood not a good
idea all right look at that got some
weird looking firewood but that's they
say in Alabama that doggle hun
put those in a different
spot right oh
man 120
people we got 120 people here that's
1,000 of the amount of
people that Brian Dy stadium in Nick
saving field can hold on any given
Saturday in the fall it's a lot of
people
I think this is Pine but I don't know I

[09:02]
I think this is Pine but I don't know I
don't know it's not Oak I'm an oak guy I
smoke barbecue Post
Oak
oh oh
man even waffles is into it there Sean
waffles even he's into
it here we go double recer
duplex to a
[Music]
fourplex oh fell on my foot there it
is there's my dayer heart
[Music]
moment
woo now it's not not cool or

[10:01]
woo now it's not not cool or
[Music]
what at that got a big old KN
there why not what I
say now this wood is quite wet it is not
seasoned it's not optimized the firewood
burning but that twoo is
strategic we have a for
Action what's
better burning Greenwood or a customer
complain about green
wood we not launching I'm going to
launch I'm going to
launch I got a wait for the firewood to
be seasoned yeah I'm going to do it no
you're not you're not going to do it
here's the thing about
starting not just businesses but
anything if you don't do it now you
won't do
it
CFA f for

[11:03]
Action you do a double
deer duplex
situation how many people we
got
113 we got 113 in
here y are some sick puppies
[Music]
all right so the business
[Music]
plan here's the business
plan collect
firewood sprit
firewood Miss firewood for sale on
Facebook
marketplace now if we if we do not sell
it on Facebook Marketplace

[12:00]
it on Facebook Marketplace
we got to give on
Creative but we'll sell it on Facebook
Marketplace another secret weapon for
[Music]
you the other secret
weapon is the fact
that people don't want to buy from a 37
year
old for 700 bucks a cord that already
owns a bunch of businesses and isn't
very hungry I mean look at me I'm not
very hungry I'm doing just
fine now if I were a 37 year
old I we hungry either literally
or
metaphorically and I was
driven and I was wanting to start a
business to feed my
family and I did a good job of conveying
that
story and people would be more likely to
buy from

[13:00]
but if I'm a 17year old or a
16-year-old named Kate or
Devon trying to earn money for college
trying to learn
entrepreneurship they're going to be
more likely to buy from
you so yes that will be my number one
selling
point is this one season
no is it the most optimal firewor
no do we live in a climate
that there as well let fire no we live
in Dallas it's hot 13 months out of the
year but those are all excuses to not
stop can you stack these
up all right so how much time we' been
going I'm trying to gauge
like how much time we been goinging 10
minutes 14 minutes how many long for got

[14:02]
there what a
lot so a cord of wood is four by 4 by 8
ft okay so if you think about the
average bet of a
truck that's going to be
about 4 by 8 by two 4T wide 8T long 2T
tall
so the average truck bed fits about half
a quarter
wood right now in North
BFW a half a qu of
wood goes for about $300 to
$400 that would be two truck loads worth
of
wood and
so what would you say that is right
there you got about

[15:03]
two
feet by 3
fet by fo and a half
six got nine cubic feet so 4 by 4 by 8 4
by 4 16 *
8 so call this
like 8% of a cord 4x4x4
16 by4 64 so $400 for 64 cubic
feet and that's nine so that's 15% so
that's about $60 worth of wood it's not
to much more than $60 worth of wood
because you buy by the acre you sell by
a foot okay the smaller quantities that
you sell equals the more work you put
into it equals the more money you can
sell these bundle for

[16:05]
why you buy 100 acres of land for a
million dollars you split it into 100
101 acre home sites you sell them for 20
grand
each that's 2 million
bucks you double your money you got
development cost you got entitlement
cost not all profit but you bu R the A7
out the foot
so in 14 minutes we made about $60 worth
of firewood give or
take now for you calculator wielers
watching this type it away in your
spreadsheet you do you
[Applause]
okay what we call this down
Bo what we call that

[17:01]
