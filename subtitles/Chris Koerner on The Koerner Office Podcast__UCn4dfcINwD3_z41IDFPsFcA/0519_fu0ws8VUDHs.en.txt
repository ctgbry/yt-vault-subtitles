[00:00]
anyone listening I'm 100% sure this
business would work if I were a betting
man which I am I would bet large amounts
of money that people would pay for this
and you could charge decent money for it
it's easier to sell things to people
that have money that makes some money
saturation is essentially a myth I've
said the same thing nothing's
oversaturated that million $2 million a
year is just a formula we all have the
same keyboard you just press the right
button the longer you stay on the wrong
train the more expensive the ticket to
the right one
is welcome to the Kerner office I had my
friend James camp on today James lives
in LA and owns a portfolio of Internet
businesses he's a super interesting guy
he's on The Cutting Edge of everything
happening in Ai and he's a marketer at
heart which I love and respect because
that's me as well James is an idea
machine which is why I love him so we
chat at about four to six different
ideas some in AI some not I got super
hyped by the end of it you know I'm
hyped about an episode when I end it
with a headache and I did on this
episode James had a couple big exits
earlier in his career for the last
little while he's been content just
buying Andor building these Niche sites

[01:01]
buying Andor building these Niche sites
that are super profitable this episode
will be split into two parts so come
back in a few days or a week or so and
we'll air part two enjoy if you were to
take your like business investing
startup philosophy into a quick
framework like what do you look for what
type of businesses do you love what do
you avoid sure so I think that for me
what I love is consumer super fun it's
just really hard and like what I would
tell whenever we talk to people that are
like buying little internet businesses
consumer just like see like Ecom is
really really really tough I think we
had a moment in covid where everyone
thought you could just run a Shopify
based brand and it was going to be so
easy just y you you cut out the
middleman direct a consumer you know
it's just much tougher than people
perceive especially bootstrapping it's
just so many more moving parts so I I
think consumer is really fun and I and
but I think that probably moving forward
for me I'm going to unless someone comes
to me with an idea and they show me this
consumer brand I love I probably focus
more on like B2B you know I think I hate
to say it's sort of a Trope at this
point but it's easier to sell things to

[02:00]
point but it's easier to sell things to
people that have money that makes them
money I would probably never I mentored
a couple tech tech accelerators and
that's like a great way to be have fun
and be involved in the startup scene as
opposed to selling to startups selling
to startups and B2B is just a nightmare
selling people that have no money as a
nightmare so I think that probably I
don't know if that answers your question
but hopefully it does a little bit yeah
it does so what are you excited about
right now like what are you not doing
publicly what are you seeing that you're
just what are you working on right now
that really gives you energy that isn't
a portfolio company yeah yeah so I mean
I had an idea the other day well I'll
tell you there's the active thing I'm
working on is much more pipeline for PE
shops and family offices right so like
helping them find businesses to buy
enabling that with AI and packaging that
together so they can get good deal flow
and then sort of on top of that layering
what are the other Investment Banking
style practices that Bankers are taking
$2 million fees on that really enable ni
AI is really going to enable and really
really change in some really weird ways
so that's actually something I'm

[03:00]
so that's actually something I'm
actively working on that fits into what
we have with off Market which is finding
off Market deal flow that will become an
upsell for us you want to buy our
database that's easy for 100 bucks a
month you can have access to our
database you want to have an advisor in
your pocket for a couple thousand bucks
a month you can if if you would like to
have us do all the Outreach for you and
do all the due diligence we will for
five six grand a month you know get you
six businesses to look at that are fully
packaged up ready to buy and then we
take you know you know some two or 3% on
the closed transac right that's
something I'm actively working on I'm
not a tech dude at all but I had like a
thought maybe I was inspired by a tweet
nothing's original we're all inspired by
other things but I thought yesterday the
day before which is like if I could
figure out how because my first little
business win was like an ad Network
oddly when I was 19 20 sold a little CPA
network not for a lot of money but if we
could figure out how to pixel wallets in
crypto I can't think of a better like
new opportunity for the ads for adte

[04:01]
new opportunity for the ads for adte
then me serving ads predicated on
transactions that your wallet has taken
because it's all on a blockchain it's
not a question for me it's not a
question whether you maybe purchased
something or you may be it's like I'm
100% sure that this wallet has done
these transactions yeah yeah and I
almost before we started recording I am
s dude I've been around this business
building block my my whole life and I
know execution is almost everything and
ideas are so worthless and so normally
people like oh I have an idea but I
don't want to tell you because it's a
secret like okay bro shut up you know
what I mean like I'll sign your your NDA
it's just stupid this is one of the
first things where I've been like oh
whoa like that's I
actually yeah like and now we're just
gonna put it out to world it's fine but
the way I guess I'll parlay that is if
anyone listens or watches this and
thinks that they understand Tech side
how to accomplish that but has no idea
how to like take that to Market and know
how to get the capital to do so feel
free to reach out reach out to me
because I from a technical standpoint do
not understand how to do that but I do

[05:00]
not understand how to do that but I do
think that that's going to be like a
major opportunity I think that that's
going to be sort of that's what I would
love that's what I think be cool to be
working on I just have not a clue how to
do it yeah because it's like as an
Advertiser you don't care in this case
that it's a 37y old white male in Dallas
but you know that that guy has this much
Bitcoin and he frequently sends to his
coinbase wallet and he's frequently
buying this and it's almost like it's a
pixel inside your credit card account
for your bank account yeah 100% And so I
guess it's sort of like if you think
about like social advertising is like is
like psychographic and demographic based
ads right so this is much more like this
this is much more like Google right like
like does someone SE a search you're
actually capturing someone at that
moment of purchase right that's that's
why like search traffic converts so well
right so how where to buy blank
excellent here's an ad for blank it's
great to convert on that right super
high intent I think that this is pretty
high intent as well I think that
probably right now the use case under
the crypto it's early and again this is
why I think it's a good idea because

[06:00]
why I think it's a good idea because
it's early enough that it couldn't
really it's not the place where I think
that someone with with a trillion
dollars is like let's dedicate real
money to this because there's not enough
users that are actually using crypto or
Bitcoin whether it's through lighting
Network or usdc or wallet you know like
to actually track this and make it super
usable to advertisers but I think what
one could build out the infrastructure
and if you believe that I believe that
like I don't know if all of a sudden the
dollar disappears but if you I'm I'm
pretty long Bitcoin and definitely a lot
of crypto stuff but my my point is that
if you believe the future is changing
from a monetary perspective and payments
perspective which I do and I think the
writing is on the wall very clearly then
I do think it's thinking four or five
years out I do think that'll be it can
be a cool opportunity but yeah exactly
you know Chris bought this yesterday and
he bought this six months ago I know
that for sure you're right it's like
tracking inside credit card spend and
then tying add dollars to it yeah that's
one of those ideas where on one hand you
don't want to share it on the other hand
you're like I know whoever launches this

[07:01]
you're like I know whoever launches this
is going to have to raise a whole lot of
money and bang their head against the
wall for a long time and I'm not about
to do that so yeah whatever oh yeah yeah
the only way I would do that is like I
think I realized at this point in life
like the next big swing like this is the
type of thing I would take a really big
swing at with the right partner I'm just
so not that person like I'm I'm only one
half or maybe even a quarter or a third
marketer looks like yeah the marketer
and I really understand and I definitely
know I know where to get the capital I I
think I know the people that would be
interested in writing a check and do
something like this but it's such a huge
lift to your point that like the person
that's going to do this is either really
qualified to do this or you know they're
not going to watch this and it's not
going to be some someone that has no
idea how to do this or they're G be like
oh James is a great person let me reach
out to him you know what I mean we'll
try and do this together you know what I
mean this is not a solopreneur mission
you know what I mean no no for sure for
sure being being in the advisor game you
probably see a lot of books a lot of

[08:00]
probably see a lot of books a lot of
pnls a lot of opportunities that you're
not jumping on for whatever reason are
you seeing anything out there that's
particularly exciting to you that other
people are doing or this Niche product
or service is just crushing it that you
saw yeah I mean I think if I were
building something I mean there's a
couple Brands I'm advising that I have
said very clearly to that I would love
to buy their business you know what I
mean like because it's just so clear to
me and it's not that I'm so smart or
that I'm that creative I'm actually
quite the opposite like I'm I'm like a
thinking myself as like a b at
everything you know what I mean it's
just like I've been on this ride long
enough to see what works and what
doesn't in certain regards and there's a
couple Ecom Brands I'm looking at right
now that I'm advising actually right now
that like looking at and be like I would
love to buy you I and and I think that
probably might deter them from raising
money maybe try to introduce them to
like a credit fund you know what I mean
because I don't think that I think the
way they need Capital probably is better
in debt and warrants than it is in
giving up large chunks of equity but I'm
jealous of everyone building on this AI
stuff man I don't mean actually building

[09:00]
stuff man I don't mean actually building
AI I mean like using AI as manag yeah
they're rappers yeah like dude I if I
you know part me wants to go and like I
mean I forgot who said this but
everything's a rapper right someone I
saw someone tweet that
like type form it was it was it okay
someone was like oh that's just a rapper
it's like type form is an HTML rapper
worth a billion dollars like who cares
that it's just a rapper and I saw
someone go from that and say Venture is
just a rapper on Capital right it really
is like like fund is yeah a fund is
literally a wrapper on money it is
someone taking money which is the tool
and figuring out how to apply it in a
different way right yeah so that stuff's
all interesting to me I think there's a
major opportunity and I've tweeted about
this a bit I would do it in like I'm
just like not good at building this but
like if someone really had the flows of
like how to build agents right and then
to apply those I think you could build a
nice managed Services business on that
right now on enabling AI inside sort of
boring you knowmemes like I don't think

[10:01]
boring you knowmemes like I don't think
that that's rocket science to do I think
pretty much all the old outage of like
cold emailing and cold calling and and
you know I mean you would I would create
content in the back end and run some ads
but I think in general like you could go
easily get 50 businesses to pay you some
setup fee and some ongoing fee and I
know people that are trying to do it and
I've looked at doing it I'm sure people
are already doing it and that's enough
that's one also where there's like
enough meat on the bone for everyone to
eat you know I mean like there's going
to be a 100 people doing that 200 people
doing that it's not going to be like a
like the adtec one we were talking about
earlier that's a winner takes all or
maybe two or three oligarchy kind of
Worlds you know what I mean yeah the
managed Services of implementation and
management of AI is like of those yeah
thousands of people doing that you know
let's dive in on that because I find
that really interesting I've started
playing around with repet and agents and
I I kind of see like a managed Services
agent agency as like the next iteration
of a zapier automation agency right you
just step in you're like I know how to
use zapier I can connect this API the AP
it's $29 a month and you feel like a you

[11:01]
it's $29 a month and you feel like a you
look like a genius to them and but what
you're doing is like stuff that you've
just been doing for years right 100% I
think actually the difficulty here is
not the business anyone listening I'm
100% sure this business would work I'm
if I were a betting man which I am I
would bet large amounts of money that
what Chris and I are talking about would
functionally work as a business people
would pay for this and you could charge
decent money for it there's my hook
there's the hook thank
you good you're welcome you're welcome
I'm not bad at I'm not bad at Social I'm
not bad at hooks I was going to say that
I think the question the wall I've hit
to you could do it through audience you
could do it through cold Outreach it's
hot enough you could do it through paid
ads there's probably enough margin on it
and enough LTV to like run paid for it
the difficulty that I've run into and
I've thought through a lot is pricing
structures right because how do you
price do you price per receipt do you
price per ongoing retainer what do you
do you see what I'm saying is it setup
fee that was my next question to you is
how do you how do you charge some for
something like this I don't know I mean

[12:00]
something like this I don't know I mean
the way I thought sort of it thought I
mean we have I have clients in the it
management space you know that you're
charging per seat there essentially
sassa charging per seat right it's like
you know I think that might be a way to
do it um I I think one of the
difficulties you run into is how much
tokens cost at scale it really depends
the businesses that you're you're
pitching to probably the cost of tokens
come down in the future I bet you could
probably get some grants for tokens as
well that would allow you to run this
business like crazy high margin yeah I
think you charge a set I mean what I've
thought about doing there's some I spoke
to recently I don't want to they have
their setting up doing it because I was
Consulting them but I'll talk about how
I've thought about doing it which was
that like a setup fee um and then with a
monthly retainer and then you probably
have them pay for upgrades right so like
I think this is all moving so fast that
like probably every year you could pay
for basically a new setup fee you know
like the the retainer is much more
management it's much more like it we
make sure that your zaps are connected
we make sure that you're you know th000
2,000 bucks a month instead of paying x

[13:00]
2,000 bucks a month instead of paying x
amount of employees like we're just
going to watch it and manage like manage
WordPress hosting you know I mean if
something happens it gets fixed and then
you probably every 12 to 24 months can
do another real like setup for you be my
guess that's that's my gut on it you
know I'm trying to think of how I would
do it like I think I would probably
start super Niche and say like I set up
email agents for small businesses right
and here's a here's a relevant example
that I just did for myself you've heard
of Lindy AI sure so I just used Lindy
for the first time I have this lead
magnet on TKO pod.com where people can
get my tool kit bunch of growth acts
business ideas y yada for whatever
reason this is hosted in Google Drive
the links frequently don't work they
just don't work I don't know why and I'm
trying to fix it I'm going to move it to
webflow or whatever or for whatever
reason when they subscribe to my beehive
they don't get the confirmation email
and so every single day I get emails
saying I didn't get the email where's
the toolkit the links don't work and I
have my assistant responding them the
same thing over and over and over so I

[14:01]
same thing over and over and over so I
went to Lindy I've never used Lindy in
my life I five minutes because it's
easier than zapier even right five
minutes I've got an agent set up that's
automatically responding to those in a
smart way using Ai and now granted you
could do this with zapier a year ago
because the open AI integration has been
active on zapier for that long and it's
kind of the same thing but you gotta H
Cobble it together and there's more
moving Parts more to break this was a
game changer so maybe you could say I'm
going to go into a dental office
and I'm going to look at your emails I'm
going to spend an hour observing that's
the setup fee that you're charging for
and I'm going to say okay you're getting
these emails per day I'm going to charge
the setup fee plus like a a per email
rate or like a a monthly rate like you
said and that's all you're going to do
is emails and that's your foot in the
door that's your way to earn trust you
come back the next month and you say
let's look at your your booking system
right and I'll integrate your calendar
right and you can set charge another
setup fee for that and increase your

[15:00]
setup fee for that and increase your
monthly fee because now you're managing
more stuff that's breaking what do you
think about something like that I mean I
think that's right I think the question
what's really difficult and this is
going to sound ridiculous but you start
to ask yourself and this is actually
where I get it I think that most people
should avoid what I'm doing here because
I actually get in my own way all the
time this these days because I built a
couple things that have scaled a bit and
not like true scale I mean baby scale
eight figures of scale right I mean
obviously we have multi- trillion dollar
companies today right but often I how
far can this scale out so I think that
if you asked me like how do I want to go
make 10 or 20 grand a month you know I
think that what you said sounds great
and is totally possible I think that a
lot of a lot of margins change at scale
as you know Opex just really does change
at scale and I don't know if that
becomes a 50 million doll business what
you just said although I do think it
wedges open the door in and each way I
think that makes a ton of sense I would
go that way too I would get super
specific with who I approached I would
look at some sort of you know maybe you
know what's some automation I get set up
that takes 10 minutes right that I could
maybe even do on a sales call with them

[16:03]
maybe even do on a sales call with them
like you know like what's something I
could get them to do there that was like
this free lead magnet right like you
know obviously you want have qualified
leads come in maybe through a quiz
through a type form like making sure
that whoever you're doing it for is
right but like that you can all of a
sudden prove that you're going to save
someone an hour or a day with 10 minutes
of your time right you know and I think
that yeah I do think it opens up the
doors to more and more and more you can
do I do like the idea of per email
sending why not I've never thought about
again the question comes at like how do
you price it and I think that the
pricing of tokens is going to change
pretty drastically but yeah dude I think
it a lot of the way I've been thinking
these days is thinking very up market
and not so up Market that it's the old
boys club I'll never get into because
there is you know the McKenzie Accenture
you know there's a level of business in
which you're you're half paying for
accountability right you're half hiring
these firms and paying so much because
you want to make sure that like when you
go to your boss or your shareholders
they know who you hired you can say this
isn't right but I do think that there's

[17:01]
isn't right but I do think that there's
a lot there's an obscene amount of money
in the lower Market world in the small
business local world but there's also
like this lower Middle Market that I
think that a lot of people don't go
after these businesses doing like 50
million 20 million 30 you know what I
mean where like there is you do have a
longer sales cycle to sell to but you
could definitely get in there and you
could you know you could probably still
go knock on a door you could probably
still go find an email and cold email
still find the decision maker but they
still have a lot of money still find the
decision makers you know and just get
moving and grooving that way but yeah I
mean that's one of those businesses if
someone said to me like which is a
common like Twitter thing if I just
start from zero and make $10,000 right
like if I if I wanted to make $10,000
for nothing I think that right now I
would figure out I would go find I've
been taking this course actually by this
guy not I saw that yeah great I mean
it's great Lear build yeah like building
how to build learning how to build a
productivity tracker and with AI all
right if you are watching this clip
right now you are watching this on
YouTube YouTube and if you are a fan of

[18:00]
YouTube YouTube and if you are a fan of
podcast please check out my podcast
while you're at it because sometimes I
have podcasts that aren't on YouTube and
sometimes I have YouTubes that aren't on
podcast so check out the Kerner office
on any podcast platform or you can go to
TKO pod.com also my newsletter will
throw that in there there are no ads
It's weekly it's different content than
my podcast and YouTube newsletter.
chrisj cerner.com You'll see the link
and we'll see you there I would go get
really familiar go spend like 300 400
bucks on some AI course that showed you
how to create what are a agents which
are just I think automations through
llms right now right this will change in
the future if AGI comes through with
open AI but and then I would go and find
to your point go find some business
where I could walk in and be like give
me 30 minutes of your time I'm going to
set up one thing for you that's going to
save you an hour a day and if you find
it interesting I'd love to talk to you
about a way that we could work in the
long run I think I would C go cold email
or go knock on you know 50 doors you
know and and you would get on five calls
and You' close one of them you know and
and I think you could go get 10100
$2,000 setup fees done and you know into

[19:02]
$2,000 setup fees done and you know into
some management contract at $500 $1,000
a month you know and you can go build a
nice little agency that way I'm very
very very very confident in that what do
you think about this idea so I brought
this up on a recent podcast episode but
I want to hear your take on it so I just
bought the domain name neverall
again.com and I'm thinking it's kind of
like the type of name where it's like do
not pay.com which is very clear this is
what we do and what it is is it's
I'm just going to use uh wedding
planners or Brides as an example but it
could be much broader than that let's
say you're planning a wedding your own
wedding you need quotes from Caterers
you need quotes from photographers
videographers all that you're on the
phone a lot you click this button and
we're going to use air. a or synth flow
or any of the many services that have ai
like verbal calling agents and they're
going to call 20 photographers 20
Caterers 20 wedding venues and this is
what the like the opening prompt is to
be like hey I I'm actually you probably

[20:01]
be like hey I I'm actually you probably
don't say this first you're going to say
I'm calling on behalf of mallerie Smith
she's getting married on September 13th
she's looking for catering orders for 50
people she'd prefer a stake and two
sides I will say I am an AI agent you're
going to hear some awkward pauses but
please talk to me like you would a human
and I'm going to report all this back to
mallerie if your quote is competitive
she'll give you a call back in person do
you have any questions for me something
so you get it like all out and they're
like what I'm talking to a robot but
it's like you're getting ahead of it
right I'm an agent okay so that box is
checked you don't have to worry about
them dropping the call and then it's
like there going to be pauses because
that's the big downside with these calls
right now there are pauses but then it's
like I represent a human being this is
her first and last name she lives in
this city name you've heard of all this
this is real she wants to spend a lot of
money with you what's your best price
and they do that 20 times and you save
them thousands of dollars because more
quotes equals more savings and what do
you think I love that
I love that I love that because all my

[21:01]
I love that I love that because all my
like ideas are just like hyper duh and
practical or like so esoteric and large
that you would need to raise $300
million over the next decade to
accomplish it and that is something that
feels like someone could just like you
could probably get going for less than
10 grand and put in some work and and
grind work I love it I think that what's
becomes interesting to me though is that
like then do you start I'm such a I'm
such a capitalist the first business I
sold was like was a CPA Network I
started thinking about just broking
those leads then right I start thinking
about how where is there more value that
I can capture right because now it
starts to come into me where it's like
excellent mallerie Smith is calling who
does she want she's getting married boom
my God or there a million people that
buy that buy that contact info which
ironically though starts to then I'm
just that monster who's like oh we
should be selling off their data you
know I mean like you know and now I'm
the person you hate you know but I do
think that opens up an interesting
opportunity how would you charge for
that I love that do you charge though
you know do you charge per call do you

[22:00]
you know do you charge per call do you
charge you probably charge a flat rate
right probably for or like a engagement
right like my wedding planning right
yeah I feel like I feel like you have to
buy like a bundle of calls it's like you
know okay I'm gonna say 200 bucks for
100 calls and maybe you want to call 100
wedding venues maybe you want to call 10
Caterers 10 you know it's up to you so
it's like per call with a floor right
you got to spend this much sure now you
made me think about Appo was talking
about layering on top you made me think
about something that I think to take
this to another another industry this
works in are you familiar with Car
Brokers so like I think that you could
do this as a car broker and reach out to
every single I want to buy Lexus GX 550
I'm looking for the new Lexus gx550 you
could as a Car Brokers will get people
better deals on cars because
relationships they have and they will
basically just call across the whole
country to look at inventory right you
know basically the same concept with Car
Brokers right going to call every single
going to call every single Lexus
dealership in the United States today

[23:01]
dealership in the United States today
and tell them that we're looking for X
and Y because I guess the part that I'm
missing for not not that that business
is missing but where the extra
opportunity lives to me is it's like
when we talk about building a pipeline
deal flow for people buying businesses
for pree shops right I can either get a
PR Equity Firm 20 calls a month at
businesses for sale they don't want that
they want five packaged up deals every
month that look great to them but that
have actually been vetted and can look
at right so my point is for you is what
that question says to me idea the qu
next question to me is okay I'm mallerie
great I've got this pricing that's cool
but now I've got a bunch of pricing with
maybe a bunch of people that are going
to tell me they're giving me competitive
pricing because they want to get me on
the phone etc etc etc which one really
is the best I still know nothing about
these businesses except for them
competing on price which I think in
certain scenarios is not necessarily the
right way to do it so then do you have
is there opportunity to have a an upsell
as like a middleman who does some
vetting for you here right now I've
spoken to in my scenario I've spoken to
50 card de dealerships I've gotten 18
quotes right to get us from A to B well

[24:02]
quotes right to get us from A to B well
now as the car broker do I have
conversations with those 18 so then I
can bring that to my client and get them
the best singular deal does that make
sense yeah yeah it does as opposed to
presenting the client 18 different deals
to then look at themselves still same
thing with that are just price based
because in the wedding photography what
package am I getting right am I there's
some negotiating they still going to
come into it right and maybe there's
like this this is where I think we're at
with AI we're either all gonna need to
get your guns and your and your sticks
to create your fire pretty soon if if I
don't pray on the downfall of anyone if
I could you know you know John Connor so
come you know Terminator take out Sam
Alman as a child I might you know I I
think it work I think that we're looking
I think that we're looking at a scary
future I think that when systems upgrade
things have to break the old system has
to die I think a lot of people maybe
humanity is in a better place in 100
years but think of if the things come
true that Sam Alman would like to come
true over the next five years we in a
terrifying terrifying place in a lot of

[25:01]
terrifying terrifying place in a lot of
ways I think more likely more real scary
and dude I mean he says AGI in 2025 and
then they're going to move all their
efforts to go to ASI super intelligence
I mean plug me into the Matrix I guess
bro and keep me plugged in because you
know get what you need out of me but my
point there is that like I think that it
is Sam Alman learned something from Elon
Musk which is really how to oversell
he's the one of the greatest marketers
of all time he is the most own over
promiser of all time the thing about
Elon Musk is he promised he overpromises
to the moon but what he does is he
really delivers he never reaches he's
never once done what he said he would do
said he' do it yeah but he does blow
your mind on the way there right yeah
and so I think Sam Alman learned that
from Elon years ago so that's what Sam
has Sam Alman been off on timelines I
think a little bit in terms of some some
of the AGI stuff I maybe I'll eat my
words this year said reach well he I
mean I just think it's a major say I

[26:02]
mean I just think it's a major say I
don't know if you saw what he wrote last
week but he did write that in 2025 we'll
be presenting AGI the way that we
perceive it I mean dude this whole P all
of our conversations are worthless if
that's true I mean almost I mean like
really really really and especially if
we start going into ASI you know this
this super intelligence you know and
then it opens up a much more existential
conversation about what's artificial
about this you know I mean like what
makes this artificial versus you know
genuine but my point is I think we're
going into a much more place where I see
AI being the ultimate leverage tool for
for human touch on top right so like in
your scenario I think that you either go
very Mass to your point and you charge
like you know 50 bucks and you get to
use this tool and that becomes a chaotic
World in which you know 10,000 people a
month are using this tool to each do 150
phone calls and there's just another
150,000 Robo call I whatever maybe it's

[27:00]
150,000 Robo call I whatever maybe it's
possible or it becomes a little bit
higher tickets and you have a human in
the same way we do with with customer
service today you let everyone know it's
AI if you want to talk to human they can
talk to a human right but you basically
have that Outreach with the human
negotiator on the end that car broker
that sort of then says to you hey Chris
here are the three best options we
reached out to 150 vendors we got the
pricing we got was down was most
competitive and we did some negotiation
and here are your three bre options
here's the one we recommend for what we
think you're actually looking for and I
think in some like a wedding Market or a
car market there's money like that and
your plumber that you need next
immediately maybe not you know but do
you see what I'm saying that's where I
go with it yeah I can see this like this
idea specifically that I brought up is
like let's say you went Mass Market
which I could see this being it's a $100
a year subscription for a consumer
anyone that's just kind of like an
insurance policy oh my my AC went out
hey click
call 10 HVAC companies and get me the

[28:00]
call 10 HVAC companies and get me the
best quote sure and you just keep that
on speed dial at all times cool 2025 we
see that and then 2026 all the HVAC
companies are answering the phone with
AI and it's just I was gonna say
everyone answers the phone at that point
right no one doesn't answer the phone
like we see today everyone answers the
phone it's all AI they're pulling from a
database they know what the prices are
they know what the availability is and
just computers are talking to computers
and humans are ironically off their
phones less than ever I don't know that
might not be so bad first of all I like
this I think you end up in a really
interesting conundrum though about with
commoditized Services just in a race to
the bottom with two AI negotiating
against each other right like it's
different when we're saying oh like I
want this kind of flower for my wedding
I'm just making this up right my florist
right but yes my AC is out you end up in
just a total race to the bottom I'm
calling you know AI negotiating against
AI they all know the margins of their
business right I think you end up in
world where just the biggest winners win

[29:00]
world where just the biggest winners win
right the conglomerates win because they
can they can compete on price right and
you end up not being able to have does
that make sense yeah but is that any
different than like an eBay auction
where it's I want to buy a a holographic
Pokemon Charizard and everyone has a
floor price one of them is 100 one's 95
one's and it's just it's all automated
it's all the same thing it's all
commodity but they're still winners and
losers right it's kind of like this HVAC
company they're they're more efficient
with their cost so they just programming
the AI like hey never quote under $300
for a condenser the guy down the street
he like I need $450 for a condenser and
so they're still negotiating but there's
also like floor prices and limits sure
yeah yeah yeah yeah totally I mean I
guess it starts to just the reason that
freaks me out I think you're right is
you pull that thread and we start really
getting to this place of when I talk
about you know artificial intelligence
starts to be like when we have ASI and
AGI and it's computers negotiating
against computers what or what are we
here for you mean like what is this you

[30:00]
here for you mean like what is this you
know I mean it's like the the pendulum
always swings right so like smartphones
came out and we were more quote
connected than ever we're all connected
but really we're all alone more than
ever right and then AI comes along and
it's like now we're less connected than
ever because all the computers are just
talking to each other and we're still
alone right yeah yeah well dude I mean
this brings me up to I've been having
this sort of existential crisis about
what I want to do next in my life like
the big swing I want to take and part of
me thinks that like I'm so addicted to
my phone right and and I bought this
thing called brick the other day it's
literally like an RFID thing it makes it
so my phone doesn't work right in a
different way and I realized I'm pretty
passionate about I try and start my
mornings for hour no phone or at least
no social media right which becomes
tough for someone like you and me whose
job gets sort of intertwined with social
media the line gets very blurred but if
another like quick little side hustle
that has to do with sort of connecting
or being disconnected I think there's
really easy money and a huge wave that's

[31:00]
really easy money and a huge wave that's
going to come with like digital detox
retreating I'm sure it already exists
right but I'm like and I've thought
about it because I'm kind of passionate
about that right like could you get you
know 15 people to pay 10 people you know
to pay 3,000 bucks for a weekend in
which ironically your margins were great
because instead of trying to make their
you know you you it's about detoxing
about this dopamine yeah come sit in the
woods you know what I mean like we're
going to go canoeing we're going to walk
on nature we're going to touch grass we
call it touch this is called a
butterfly yeah you know what I mean and
and by the way I mean even if I say it
out loud I'm positive the irony is the
way I would advertise it would be
through the through the phone and
computer right but like you know I think
that you could probably this makes me
think of another business idea that I
like I want to bring up quickly but I
think that you could probably easily now
does it skill to be a100 million
business no do I think that you could go

[32:02]
business no do I think that you could go
make you could run quarterly Retreats
and make 30 you know 30 grand on each
one for sure I think you can run weekend
retreat and every weekend make four or
five grand 10 people 500 bucks it's an
overnight you buy a bunch of tents you
pop them up you know what I mean like
for real for real they all all their
phones go in a fair day bag or whatever
you I mean that someone gets taken away
you give a rule beforehand to them which
is like we're going to watch your phones
overnight some is going to have them in
their hands if ex give us three phone
numbers do you see I'm saying or names
or whatever or triggers that if they
happen we will bring your phone to you
right like your mother calls you do I
mean like your sister you know you're
you get a work call from your CEO
whatever it is that's your sort of like
you know and obviously you can press a
button and Escape right like like in in
yeah and that's that it's like an escape
it's a digital escape room a digital
escape room right and you would do and
you put everyone in tense and you do
some sort of meditation it's very low
cost you get 10 people a weekend at at

[33:02]
cost you get 10 people a weekend at at
750 for two nights at 500 you and I
think you could easily do half a million
dollars a year on that business and
margin wise take home a quarter million
you know I mean I think the margins are
super high and it's probably fun and
you're doing good for the world because
we're early on in that industry and
those things exist today at like a
multi- thousand doll price point and I
think that happens in any industry in
the nent stage it's super Niche it's
expensive it's luxury it just has to
come down Market I think there's a
market for that all my friends and I may
do it myself do this thing called the
Hoffman Institute which is like it's
there's one in in in California there's
one in Canada it's like 12 grand for 10
days they take your phone and you learn
you know and and they and they're sold
out six months ahead and by the way go
look on Twitter people looking at
Hoffman Institute everyone loves it
everyone says it changes their lives
made them the best person the best
entrepreneur you know like more pres I
mean you and I were talking about
conferences prior to being on the you
know 10K for a conference is nothing to
the Right audience it's about finding
the Right audience I do think to your

[34:00]
the Right audience I do think to your
point this is about going a little bit
lower Market a little bit down market
and saying like it's 500 bucks you know
we're gonna all your food's going to be
taken care of you're going to do
meditation you're going to do a hike and
you're going to sleep in a tent or
you're going to sleep in a cabin
whatever it is your margin stay pretty
high all right what you think please
share it with a friend and we'll see you
next time on the ker office
