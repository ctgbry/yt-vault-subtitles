this is my friend Rand he just paid
$42,000 for this camper van that has
100,000 Mi on it and he's traveling
around the country hosting meetups for
entrepreneurs but first he just told me
about the business opportunity that
anyone could execute based around buying
a used van like these and renting it out
for $1 to $200 a night so this van has
600 watts of solar panels on the ceiling
which Powers just about everything
there's a huge surplus of these used
vans right now because everyone bought
him up during Co and now it's a buyer's
market he said that Facebook Marketplace
and Craigslist are the best places to
find him and you can find something like
this for around 45 to 50 Grand at 60%
occupancy you could expect to get all
your money back from something like this
in like 1 to 2 years depending on the
market and the seasonality so go check
out rand's website here and follow me
for more info like this
