this boggles my mind this restaurant in
Austin frequently goes viral posting
these insane pictures of their food but
it's hiding a huge secret that almost no
one knows it's not a real restaurant all
of these pictures are AI generated but
this is a brilliant strategy that anyone
could copy let's say you want to sell a
food product at some point in the future
you've got to employ what I call the
ethical bait and switch open an
Instagram account start generating AI
images of potential food products using
something like mid Journey or open AI
generate 50 different random food
products and post all of them two to
three times a day and see which ones go
viral that will give you the data you
need start crafting an actual real food
product in your local area that's an
important part of this it has to be a
localized Instagram page because you
actually want to start selling food you
don't need to open a restaurant you
could ship this Nationwide you can sell
it out of your house let the algorithm
show you what types of food is in high
demand and then make that and then start
selling it to the followers that you get
thinking that this food is real when
it's actually not what do you have to
lose follow me for more business ideas
