[00:00]
did you know that you can negotiate your
college tuition what percentage of
people do it you charge $0 to the
families or the students you take a
percentage of whatever you save what do
you have to lose you're going to pay us
$500 a year and we're just going to be
one phone call away I have a close
friend of mine he decided he was going
to launch a business with a relative he
ended up investing over $200,000 into
this this family member said actually
this isn't for me I'm out he knew
someone high up they're like don't go to
an Urgent Care go to a hospital because
the Urgent Care is required to report
you to the
[Music]
university did you know that you can
negotiate your college tuition did you
know that anyone yes it's
negotiable what percentage of people do
it it's got to be less than 5% I don't
have the answer so whatever you say I'll
believe we're going to say 4% perfect 4%
let's call it four that's a
fact 4% of people try to negotiate their

[01:02]
fact 4% of people try to negotiate their
their tuition what percentage of people
even know it's possible give me a number
I'll believe it immediately in the same
percentage ballpark 5% yeah I didn't
know it until about a month ago when I
heard it on another podcast which I
won't mention don't say the
name does it rhyme with fers
Gillian no not at all
[Laughter]
actually was that believable
so
funny all right so I've done some
research I did some homework here I
don't know if any company doing tuition
negotiations as a service why not why
would we not do this it's an alignment
of incentives you charge zero dollar to
the families or the students you take a
percentage of whatever you save what do
you have to lose poke holes in it what
are we doing I think it's very analogous
to Insurance more people know about this
did you know you can you can negotiate
the bill from your insurance company
medic health insurance right I'm not

[02:01]
medic health insurance right I'm not
talking about the premium I'm talking
about when you get a bill from the
hospital it's like oh I had my kidneys
removed kidneys REM anyways who does
that appendectomy you can negotiate with
them now most people don't negotiate
with them but you can negotiate with
them and I think that there are some
businesses around negotiation as a
service but that's also not very popular
the reason I think that it's not more
popular and the reason I brought up
insurance is because there are so many
different insurance companies that you
have to talk to the decision maker
there's many different potential
decision makers at each insurance
company and the same feels true to me
for universities is like you you can't
just group oh okay these are the 10
universities I applied to and I got into
I'm going to group negotiate with them
or at least from the outside that that
would be my reasoning is it'd be very
hard to build individual relationships
at scale that allow you to then
negotiate well it all goes to the
admissions office I'm just saying
there's a lot of people in the
admissions offices and there is a
potentially a significant amount of
turnover and so

[03:00]
turnover and so
you'd have to build individual
relationships with individual
universities that doesn't necessarily
scale you could start it at like like I
went to USC cool I'm the USC tuition
negotiator I could see that being like a
good standle on business well from what
I understand I read some Reddit posts
from parents that have done this
successfully for their kids and you
don't really need a long-standing
relationship it's kind of like Chris did
Lori Laughlin post this I don't know who
that is and I'm too afraid to ask at
this point she she's the a from Full
House who paid remember the whole the
whole
celebrity get people on the row team
it's like this is how they got them into
college all right sorry keep going keep
going no like I I see what you mean but
I don't think I don't think that's how
you frame yourself when you make this
call you're like hey I'm I'm working
with Susie you know she really wants to
get into USC it's her top choice but our
budget for tuition is only X and you
guys are at Y what can you do like
that's how the conversation goes you
just need to talk to the admissions

[04:00]
just need to talk to the admissions
office and preferably right before
they're about to close admissions
because these guys have quotas and goals
that they want to hit and historically
over the last few years tuition keeps
going up and enrollment is going down
which means they're more desperate you
think that those things wouldn't both be
happening at the same time right I don't
who would have thought that a university
doesn't know how supply and demand Works
who would have thought that so I don't
see it and you could be right in that
this how it would be in reality but I
don't see it as a something that's very
relationship driven like hey it's me
again hey I've got this student hey it's
me again it's just like hey I represent
so and so she really wants in but we
need a break and the the savings might
be like 8,000 a semester instead of nine
but over eight semesters and if you take
30% of that that's very tangible and
people don't like to negotiate we know
that negotiations as a service is a
thing Andrew Wilkins had a company that
did it very successfully they sold and
he's publicly said I'm launching that

[05:00]
he's publicly said I'm launching that
again I want to do that again because it
was an amazing business so it's
basically that framework applied to
universities and the alignment of
incentives is what I like because it's
something that no one has to pay for I
only eat when you eat we had a similar
idea around having virtual assistants
kind of negotiate car prices remember
this was like a couple months ago that
we talked about this so I think
negotiation as a service is a really
really good idea you're framing it more
as like all right I'm going to I'm going
I'm The Advocate on behalf of this
student and the parents calling the
university I think that could work yeah
why would that not work if the student
wasn't in a position of Leverage it
wouldn't work that's basically what
they're paying for is you don't want to
be like hey I got 20 universities on top
which which who's the cheapest like
that's not how you play this game you're
like this is our first choice we're
admitted into four this is our first
choice but you're just you're too
expensive we really want to go there
like what can you do to help us get into
your school at a could you do 8,000 a
semester okay so to our distribution

[06:01]
semester okay so to our distribution
question how would you go about
acquiring customers for this like where
would you go how how would you find
people to represent in order to
negotiate for their tuition to be
cheaper this plays into one of the
Frameworks that I talked about recently
it's kind of like I just did an episode
with a line striping business owner and
he acquires customers quite easily
because he drives around Waco Texas sees
a parking lot with faded lines and he
knows for a fact that guy needs him he
might not be ready today but it's not a
cold knock it's a very warm knock
because it's like you're going to be
paying someone to do this might as well
be me and he said none of his
competitors are door knocking and so I
like this because everyone knows who all
the high school seniors are they're
listed on the website they're right
there they're at the football games and
so this is something that it's like a
barbell strategy you either start hyper
local or you start on Instagram and
nothing in between go to your friends
and families that have high school
seniors and say hey I'm just testing
this out I'm not even to take a

[07:00]
this out I'm not even to take a
percentage I just want to learn my
skills hone my skills will you give me a
testimonial if I'm if I even save you a
dollar what do you have to lose nothing
you've already been accepted you have
nothing to lose okay now you get some
testimonials throw them up on a website
now you start charging 10 to 30% to
locals to keep doing the same thing or
this is a very similar idea to a guy I
know on Instagram that does cold
emailing as a service for parents that
want their kid to get a scholarship an
athletic scholarship and he only does it
through Instagram he makes a lot of
money and he just posts content about
how to get scholarships how to reach out
to coaches you were smiling oh because I
it made me think of the Lori Laughlin
situation again where they were paying
people for you know scholarships to the
road team I would I think I love this
framework that we came up with I mean
obviously it's an existing framework but
something that was a light bu moment for
us a couple months ago I would look at
the piggybacking it's like okay who's
already working with these individuals
so could be the test prep companies it

[08:01]
so could be the test prep companies it
could be the admissions prep companies
because there you know there are
companies that help you write your
personal statement that gets your they
just do an audit of like what do your
extracurriculars look like and how is
your application going to be and I would
probably Target a specific I'm I'm GNA
use USC as an example I went to USC I
would see if there's anybody in my
network who works at USC first of all
and I would contact the admissions
office and see if I if they could give
me a
recommendation for the companies that
they've seen students work with with
most likely to get a scholarship at USC
I know that's like a very specific
question but I think USC would know like
oh man Kaplan does a really good job
preparing students for the admission
process and we've seen their students
come through here or or whoever it is
right those admission departments are
going to have relationships with these
companies because that is very relation
relational as well it's like oh I talked
to Laura at Cascade test prep she's
helping you oh she she's great she's
going to do a really good job of
prepping you know whatever your
application so I ask them who they work

[09:01]
application so I ask them who they work
with and then I would go to those
companies and say hey look free service
I eat what I kill but I want to
negotiate on behalf of these families
because they're already a qualified
student they've gotten in they're paying
something so now there's a negotiation
process I think that's probably where I
would start is by piggybacking off of
those I like that because like
University admission coaching that's
like a wellestablished industry how to
get into Harvard how to get into the
school or how to get scholarships that
industry has been around forever right
we'll help you apply for scholarships
we'll help you with your essay writing
we'll develop your skills we'll help you
with your sat or your ACT score that's
been around so just piggy back on one of
those guys and say hey you're not doing
negotiations as a service I'm really
really good at this you don't pay me
anything but for every every person you
refer to me I'll give you a third of my
cut what do you have to lose now you
better be good at negotiations I would
not do this business because I would be
like oh you're charging 80,000 well you
better give me it for 60 and they're
like I mean final offer is $

[10:02]
like I mean final offer is $
79999 okay fine I'll take it I'll take
it it's a win I just wouldn't be good I
just wouldn't be good at negotiating
with the universities but but if you're
like a Hardline negotiator you go for it
you should like this would be something
really cool to launch yeah I bet it's
it's an easier negotiation than car
dealerships right because that's all
those guys do all day you're up against
some yeah but with this you're up
against Susan in the front office that
is like you know un L less five I mean a
very small minority of people negotiate
anyways so they're probably not used to
negotiating I like it that's good one
so I have a close friend of mine I'm not
going to say who he is because it would
immediately out him
but he's he's successful he has a really
successful business big business does
really really well and he's a very
generous guy smart guy people love him
really well known in his

[11:00]
really well known in his
community and about a year ago he
decided he was going to launch a
business with a relative and this
relative came to him pitched him the
idea and this friend of mine is is very
wealthy and so he's like yeah I'll put
some money behind it I want to invest in
you I want to see you be successful uh
and so they launch an apparel brand I
shouldn't say launch they had the idea
to launch an apparel brand and this
friend of mine when he goes in he goes
all in he they launched a wire over to
China
yes yes it was funny because he like
started really getting into the world of
sourcing and he was like so I'm on
WhatsApp now and I'm sending them
payments and I'm I'm trying to work with
these contractors I'm paying them over
wise but I don't like wise like it's
just funny to hear these conversations
from someone other than you anyways he
ended up investing over $200,000 into
this and this family member said
actually this isn't for me I'm out so he
backed out and so right so my friend my

[12:00]
backed out and so right so my friend my
friend now has $200,000 worth of
inventory not that he valued I posted
about this on Twitter and people were
like first of all it's not worth
$200,000 like yeah I know that but
200,000 that he spent on inventory so
retail value million bucks I mean
potentially I don't know I don't know
right I'm just I'm just saying he's into
it for 200,000 probably retailing
between $ 800 and a million dollars just
based on what I know about apparel
retail and he's got $200,000 worth of
merchandise sitting in his garage and
like these are it's not just a shirt
$200,000 worth of a shirt it's shirts
sweatshirts socks sunglasses I mean
anything you can think of from an
apparal standpoint so I when I found out
about this couldn't wait to talk to you
about it because I'm like there's got to
be something here he's just going to
write it off he's like ah it's not worth
it to me it's not worth my time to like
figure it out I I'll get the tax write
off and he's successful enough I know it

[13:00]
off and he's successful enough I know it
sounds crazy but he's successful enough
where it's like $200,000 sucks it's a
speed bump you know it's not anything
crazy but I'm sitting here I'm like dude
can we do something with it like is
there something that could be done here
so knowing what you know what would you
do if you were either in his situation
or my situation or if you were an
entrepreneur that you're like you knew
that this was an opportunity he's got
all this merchandise how would you take
advantage of this like there has to be
something you could do to actually
recoup some of the cost let me start
with a framework can I zoom out first
Absol we talk about this all the time
whenever you start a business the
natural progression is to start with the
things that you can wrap your arms
around I'm going to design a logo I'm
going to buy a domain name I'm going to
file an LLC those are the easier things
and I don't blame people I've been there
too it's the thing you're like I'm
making progress and at least you are
making progress right even if you just
buy a domain and you're doing more than
just thinking about it it's like I'm
going to talk to people I'm going to get
feedback Y and that's usually a train
wreck the people you're talking to

[14:00]
wreck the people you're talking to
aren't your Target customer or they're
biased or they love you so whatever
you're hearing is just is not good
feedback most of the time anytime you
want to start a business you want to
start with the hardest thing and the
hardest thing is getting Revenue getting
customers if you start with the hardest
thing and you fail then you failed
before you really spent a dollar or if
you start with the hardest thing and you
succeeded then everything kind of gets
easier from there right but when you're
starting an apparel brand the easiest
thing is to buy apparel that's not
that's like not the easiest it's one of
the easier things to do and it's the fun
thing it's the fun thing it's exciting
we're make oh here it is here it is oh
look at it I'm going to wear it around
I'm going to talk to people about it
that's not the hard thing the hard thing
to do is be apparel brand number
8,752 th000 because that's like one of
the most competitive categories there is
because it's a huge Tam and everyone
wears clothes but like I would think
I've never started an apparel brand it
scares me because it's so crowded it's
got to be really hard to break through
the noise with an apparel brand right so
if you could actually successfully sell

[15:01]
if you could actually successfully sell
a hundred shirts even at a $ Z margin
then you feel a lot better buying
$200,000 worth of shirts right look I
agree with you I'm just saying it's the
situation he's in and he has these
assets that he's branded and they're
sitting in his garage and you know
you've got send eats or Texas snacks
excuse me where you where you resell
bies products so I mean you have
experience with selling this stuff here
are some of the ideas that people gave
me on Twitter call a liquidator because
apparently companies just Liquidators
will will take these and resell them
they have their own distribution
networks and I I did ask and I'm like do
I just Google like ex Liquidators like
how do I find Liquidators I have no idea
never done anything like that before so
that that was kind of interesting one of
the ideas that I really liked was find a
couple of influencers and just pay them
to wear your apparel and then I got an
idea for maybe you'll get some sales
coming in so that was I'm I'm going to
say a couple other ideas and then I'll
you

[16:00]
you
riff so I thought that was kind of an an
interesting one one that I thought was
really cool was like just use it as a
marketing expense Say Hey I want to take
five people and whoever has the best
whoever sells the most merchandise wins
and so it's like you create this
competition around this sort of dead
inventory and you know like for somebody
like us it would be a really cool way to
grow a brand or build an audience
because you're you know people are
competing syllabus so I thought that was
a really really cool idea anyways those
are three really I thought pretty cool
ideas that you could do with it I like
it all right if you were watching this
clip right now you are watching this on
YouTube and if you are a fan of podcast
please check out my podcast while you're
at it because sometimes I have podcasts
that aren't on YouTube and sometimes I
have YouTubes that aren't on podcast so
check out the ker office on any podcast
platform or you can go to TKO pod.com
also my newsletter will throw that in
there there are no ads It's weekly it's
different content than my podcast and
YouTube newsletter. chrisj cerner.com
you'll see link and we'll see you there

[17:00]
you'll see link and we'll see you there
the problem with the Liquidator is he's
probably going to pay like 10 grand for
all of this it's better than nothing but
like no we're going to see a bunch of
kids in Kenya running around with these
shirts in a year or two right right next
to the right next to the Utah Jazz 1998
National Championship
shirts oh NBA
championship yeah I'm an idiot National
Championship gosh Alabama
2017 the Alabama 201 17 Super Bowl
champions keep their name out your
mouth okay all right keep going I have
an idea that's creative but it only
works if these shirts look okay can you
can I see as I talk about this as I
ideate can you send me a picture just a
logo anything these are their socks can
you hold it up closer I have other logos
I just I just don't have any pictures of
them it's an M okay it's an M yeah I'll
tell you offline what the name of it is
it's it's also not a great name name but
I mean it has meaning behind the name

[18:01]
I mean it has meaning behind the name
but it's not like an easily marketable
name do the shirts just kind of look
like that logo is it just like an M or
is there something written on the shirt
I no it has the name has the name but
they're they're pretty I would say
they're pretty tame shirts I don't know
how else to say it's like it's like I
have this Nike sweater on
right and you can see the Nike logo but
it's it's uh it's understated that's I
guess that's the word I'm looking for
it's not flashy I want you to Google God
is dope tell me what you see okay God
doesn't do drugs but I'll take a look
God is dope God's favorite band now look
at their t-shirts and find the one that
just has the big the big block
letters on the front white background
that just says God is dope okay from Top
you see that yeah so the story behind
this brand is really cool this guy was
in Atlanta the first thing he sold was
only that shirt with that logo that's it
God is dopee with a period big bold

[19:01]
God is dopee with a period big bold
letters and he went around the Streets
of Atlanta and he gave them out for free
no questions asked 100% free and people
started wearing them and then people
started Googling it people started going
to his website and then he did something
that was also genius he sold them for $5
on his website he did not make money on
any of them and it went viral it it went
organically viral because so many people
were wearing them talking about them it
was actually a really cool looking shirt
that was actually affordable to everyone
and then once he had a massive email
list he started dropping new products
that were a little more expensive but
still very reasonable this guy I'm not
exaggerating this this is a $30 million
a year business and it was started by a
guy in Atlanta with no money no skills
no Talent he could just he designed a
logo he was good at making that logo
sorry I say no Talent he clearly has
talent but he had no background he had
no funding yeah yeah yeah he just I mean
how many guys have a shirt idea
every other guy right but it's a $30

[20:01]
every other guy right but it's a $30
million company based on One logo are
you saying you would you would try to
launch the brand like you would be like
all right just launch the brand just
give away think of it as marketing
you're gonna give it away for free yeah
like if if I have to choose between a
liquidator giving me 10 grand or me
giving them away for free like in a
defined local area to thousands or
hundreds of people somehow you go to a
football game anyone that goes to the
the Eagle football game gets a free
t-shirt like and just see if that
catches fire yeah because it's it's dead
inventory anyways right the problem that
he's up against though is the fact that
I think God is dope works I think God is
dope works because it's sending a
message that is polarizing that people
resonate with they believe in
fundamentally and it's affordable and
it's good design it's like the vend
diagram affordable Mass Market good
design Mass Market the message Mass
market and so he just he hit he hit a
trigger there and then the fourth circle

[21:02]
trigger there and then the fourth circle
of the VIN diagram brilliant
distribution strategy so your friend
won't be able to do all of those things
because the it's already done they're
already printed and it doesn't really
send a message it's just a logo but he
could at least try one of or two of the
vend diagram options there is a message
behind the logo like it is a very
meaningful logo I would say it looks
good like the stuff's good quality that
they have are you able to say what the
message is like what the meaning is
behind the brand the meaning behind it
yeah I don't want to just like it would
give it away I'm gonna ask him if if I'm
if he's cool with me talking about it
and I think that he is cool with me
talking about it but I I don't want to
say it without if I were him I would get
there's these little tools that will
allow you to attach a tag to a piece of
clothing right like when you go buy a
piece of clothes you go buy clothes at
the store you could buy those tools for
like 10 bucks on Amazon then you get the
little plastic tags and then you print
something I were him I would put up a
website Shopify put a QR code to the
website on the tag and put a story like
the heartfelt meaningful story whatever

[22:01]
the heartfelt meaningful story whatever
the story is behind the brand attach it
to each t-shirt give them out for free
to like the same type of demographic
call high schoolers College that's a
great idea whatever that's a great idea
well and that was the fourth one that
people recommended they were like find a
local high school student or young
hungry entrepreneur and just like let
them have it they can list it they can
sell it and essentially give them the
starting inventory to launch the brand
that's another good idea yeah I like
that so I and just hearing you talk
about the high school thing kind of
brought that up but I think that's a
great idea again it wouldn't be for him
because he just doesn't have the time to
dedicate to it but if somebody was like
oh they've got all this inventory you
know take a flyer on it you could easily
attach those QR codes it could scan you
could tell the story give it away for
free I like that I really like that that
that's really cool is do you think the
story behind it is Meaningful enough to
like really resonate with people
yeah and he was smart like the brand is

[23:03]
yeah and he was smart like the brand is
tailored like he's he's very clear on
who his ICP is it's not just
like it looks
cool he's very clear on who is insane
clown posi is he's very clear on who his
Target demographic is and I think that
works in his favor because it's not just
like oh it has to look cool and then
people will like it it's it's like oh
it's very specific to this type of a
person and this is the meaning of the
brand so I again I think that plays into
his into his favor like he thought about
it the right way yeah so I like it cool
I got one for you this is like the
college episode this is like because we
had the tuition idea you had that idea
which could be for a young person and I
got one that's more College focused okay
so I T I had a call with a guy couple
months ago and he went to University of
South Carolina SEC school and he got a
minor in possession charge as in minor

[24:00]
minor in possession charge as in minor
in possession of alcohol as a student
and as a fellow student that went to an
SEC school that happened to work in a
jail while I was a student I never got a
minor in possession charge we call the
MIP at the Tusc County Jail rip to the m
hey book him on an MIP book him on a MIP
we used to say that oh hey Chris where'd
you go to school I went to University
Alabama what'd you major in I majored in
business with a minor in possession
that's hilarious I guarantee you there's
a 62-year-old boomer business owner that
has an $84 million equipment rental
business that says that joke that lives
in Montgomery that says that joke on a
daily
basis I had to I had to so good anyway
and apparently he knew someone someone
high up I don't know who it was when he
got this minor in possession charge that
gave him the the good advice to to not
go to an urgent care I I don't remember

[25:02]
go to an urgent care I I don't remember
what happened if he got passed out or
whatever they're like don't go to an
Urgent Care go to a hospital because the
Urgent Care is required to report you to
the university or don't go to the Urgent
Care on campus because they will report
you to the university and you could get
kicked out of school okay it was just
like a little Nuance that changed the
game for him he didn't get kicked out of
school because he knew this and then he
thought man this is really helpful for
me to know how could I monetize this and
this was years later when he actually
had the idea of how to monetize this but
he launched this website I wouldn't call
it a business because I don't think he's
promoting it yet but it's called Dean
list and his thesis is that these rich
SEC parents want their kid to be looked
out for at school they just want okay
they're going to go there they're going
to rush for a fraternity they're going
to be a sorority they're not going to
have immediate access to them maybe
they're a helicopter parent maybe they
have money they're overbearing or
whatever wor about maybe they just love
their kid right yeah they want him to be

[26:01]
their kid right yeah they want him to be
looked out for he had the idea to have
like a service it's kind of like an
insurance policy where it's like we know
all the ticks of tricks of the trade
when you come in for parents day we know
where you can get a a table for brunch
where you can't we know the bars you
should go to the bars you shouldn't your
kid doesn't even know there know this
stuff yet because they're a freshman but
we we've got an inn in Columbia South
Carolina we know all the tricks if if
they get a minor possession take them
off campus you're going to pass $500 a
year and we're just going to be one
phone call away we're just going to wait
we'll give you some resources we'll send
you some PDFs but we're one phone call
away it's like an insurance policy to
keep an eye on your kid they're not
answering maybe their phone's dead maybe
they're kidnapped we'll go check in on
them what do you
think that' be a hilarious sales pitch
you know maybe uh questions heaven
forbid someone about well it's just like
throwing that in at the end it's like oh
you know maybe they don't know what
orientation is oh that's true maybe they
get a minor in possession oh he oh that

[27:01]
get a minor in possession oh he oh that
would be terrible you know maybe they
get kidnapped in sex traffic to Mexico
and who wait wait what that how common
is that at this school it's pretty
common it's pretty common anyways you
know maybe they stub their to hold could
we go back to the sex trafficking thing
you're talking about my son right oh
it's very prevalent amongst young men
very prevalent here anyways is it only
geared towards like parents to get their
kids out of trouble no or is it hey
welcome to here's the cool places to
it's like a trusted third party that can
just step in help like a Trip Advisor
well not even a Trip Advisor it's like a
Trip Advisor is just you're reading and
getting advice this is like someone you
could reach out to like a coner service
to could you check on Timmy I haven't
heard from him in three hours yeah it
could be as handson or as hands off as
you want and that you'd have to price it
accordingly so it's like hey we'll get
you a reservation for Parents Day it
could be a Weekly Newsletter we're going
to tell you everything going on in the
city we're going to tell you the good
places to rent a dorm the bad places to

[28:01]
places to rent a dorm the bad places to
rent a dorm because sure you know where
to rent a dorm freshman year because
they're required to live on campus but
sophomore year they're not but you don't
want them to be in the wrong area like
we will be there every step of the way I
thought it was an interesting idea it is
really there has to be something else
that's already existing right like
because people just have these questions
do they just go to Facebook right now
and look or are they like Googling stuff
if you get the students to recommend and
rate like oh this is the best bar near
campus this is is the best place to I
don't know rent your second year this is
your best place to to live senior year
and the students are telling you that
that could be really valuable but I have
to believe there's already existing I
think what people are doing is they're
just in like random Facebook groups like
parents of University of South Carolina
students and they're just kind of
talking one off but I think there's a
whole business around taking Facebook
groups off of Facebook I was just gonna
say that I like the idea of not building
a group in a community because like that
just it takes a lot of work to get it
spun up essentially you're selling an

[29:01]
spun up essentially you're selling an
info product it's like all right cool
here's the PDF you know what I mean just
like these are the most recommended
places and maybe you update it once a
quarter but then you don't have to worry
about sourcing or you know users leaving
comments or anything like you just are
the trusted source and then you give the
information once a quarter the only
thing that would give me pause is like I
don't know if I want parents calling me
for random like call the police if
you're that concerned
because otherwise like what are they
going to be calling you for here's what
I think it is it's you join all the
Facebook groups and you aggregate the
data with zapier and you put it in a
newsletter and it's a paid newsletter
but it's paid by semester maybe it's a
100 bucks and every week the parents get
a highlight of everything that's
happening in the city that they're not
going to see on Google they're not going
to find on the news it's just going to
be kind of like gossip from these local
Facebook groups maybe it's only that or
maybe it's that plus like the insurance
cont air service for a higher price I

[30:00]
cont air service for a higher price I
laugh because I feel like everything
comes back to newsletters it just makes
so much sense like it's a no-brainer
it's a no-brainer I love it though all
right here we go merry dat or kill I'll
give you my picks you'll give me yours
and then we'll talk about them so I
would marry the reselling of inventory
idea I would date the university Trip
Adviser
idea and I would kill the farmers market
food idea cuz I hate food products and
then in no man's land would be
piggybacking off of pet companies and
the university negotiations I would
marry the university negotiations
business I would date the specifically
the slanging authentic pizzas at a
farmers market idea after doing market
research to see if it would work or
not the biggest risk ever but I won't
say why and I would I would kill the
last idea that I just brought up the
university concierge parent idea yeah

[31:02]
university concierge parent idea yeah
let's start with the Mary idea I I said
Mary the inventory idea and you said
marry the university negotiations okay
why would you marry the negotiations
it's got everything I love baby cost Z
to start you can scale it it's a proven
industry it's a proven it's a proven
tactic that's not being used in this
industry but you already know that you
can negotiate appreci your tuition so we
don't have to wonder about that I had it
in no man's land just because of my own
personal PRI like I I just would not
enjoy that business the negotiation part
of it so I I agree with you though those
are good those are good points I like
the inventory idea for someone who's
just like I want to get into
entrepreneurship because it's $200,000
of just inventory and he's already
written it off at this point so they
could test a bunch of stuff they could
throw up an e-commerce site they could
mess around with Google ads they could
mess around with Facebook ads it could
do just a bunch of different things and

[32:00]
do just a bunch of different things and
learn basically on somebody else's dime
so you could acquire a really good skill
set and potentially make some money at
it that's why that's why I liked that
idea I thought it was fairly easy to
launch I really like the university Trip
Adviser idea because I think that if you
were a student at a university you could
easily put this together and start
selling it and then I killed the farmers
market stuff just because I hate food I
just I just think that's such a hard
business to scale what did you
the pizza idea why I'm not trying to
scale everything I'm trying to have fun
man with the pizza idea I think you
could make $1,000 in four hours of net
profit okay so you're saying personally
it's like you like that idea enough
where you're like oh yeah I date that
idea because I think it'd be fun not
necessarily like as a recommendation to
someone to no this is these are just
what I like personally yeah yeah yeah
not that they're necessarily the the
best you so
much I I would you and my brother-in-law
Owen remind me of each other in the
sense cuz you both love food and I could
see you like after having a big exit and

[33:01]
see you like after having a big exit and
you don't ever have to work again you're
just like tinkering on like food ideas
like every year around this time he
sells caramel apples I could see you
just like every year like oh head to the
farmers market this weekend and people
are like Chris what what are you doing
why you time to the farmers market you
make like $10 each time you're like I
just love it I love talking to people
and having them try my pizza like that
just reminds me of you it'd be awesome
that be rad all right what did you kill
University concierge why' you kill it
it's just not proven
I don't know that there's demand that
scares me I'd rather be copying someone
that's doing this all right cool all
right May to kill I love it all right
that's wrap all right what you think
please share it with a friend and we'll
see you next time on the ker office
