right here's an incredible business
model that no one ever talks about
summer camps I just reverse engineered
how much a popular summer camp breaks in
every year and I could not believe my
eyes here's how the numbers shake out 10
weeks per summer that they're open every
week is weight listed 7100 attendees on
400 acres and guess what it costs to
attend every week
$2,300 and they have a weight list on
every session so they could charge a ton
more that's $15 million a year or $1.5
million per week that they're open this
place is out in the middle of nowhere
land only costs 5 grand an acre
Insurance can't be that bad this place
is called Camp Ozark it's in a little
tiny town called tensel Bluff and the
closest big city is Little Rock at two
hours away I bet the con construction
costs are nuts there's other
complexities in there but I love this
business model what do you think follow
