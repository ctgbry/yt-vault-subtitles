oh what's that how often do I stay up
late wondering how much profit a zipline
business makes every night and I know
you do too so I went to one last week in
Northwest Arkansas and I asked all the
questions I dared to ask and here are
all the answers this place on a slow day
serves 10 customers busy day 100
customers they charge $74 per person
they're open S days per week 280 days
per year they are on 66 Acres which
today in Northwest Arkansas would cost
about 400
$170,000 their assets zip lines a couple
buses and a 4X4 back of the napkin math
tells me this is a low seven figure
business with 30% net margins Break Even
would be about 17 customers a day four
to six employees working at any given
time I just love this business I love
zipline business I love tourist business
and if you're obsessed with businesses
like I am follow me for more info like
