[00:00]
who likes calling people on the phone no
one no one that's Universal you can
click a button and call a thousand
lawyers over the next 5 minutes to us is
like oh it's called an agent but to
99.9% of humans that is mind-blowing I
ended up with a spreadsheet of 20,000
repair stor and I remember thinking I
know more about this industry than
anyone on the planet right now this is
seriously a good idea you could sell
this as a service you can sell the data
to people you could build your own
newsletter never call again.com I own it
oh dude I'm done are you freaking
kidding me
[Music]
dude well Nick do you want to kick us
off or should I you call it Chris it's
2025 okay I want you to kick us off all
right I got an idea I got a business
idea W you just took it you didn't even
fight it okay
no there's there's no time for
pleasantries okay so did you see that
tweet by Andrew Wilkinson about how he
created an AI agent to set a restaurant

[01:00]
created an AI agent to set a restaurant
reservation for him yes okay did you
watch the video of him yes on the Tweet
yes okay did you have the same thought I
did do we need to edit this out I don't
know we might I was like you're a
billionaire like he was in like this
like cardboard cut out yeah there was
like plywood behind him like good bro
blink blink twice if you good
bro is that like a Chipotle plywood Vibe
like are you are you purposely intending
for that to be a Vibe or you was it
designed on purpose I did notice that
anyway so it's just first of all
framework zooming out you and I both
know about AI agents we both know that
this Tech is possible there's a company
called
air. that has been enabling like voice
caller agents for over a year now and I
played with it right when it came out
and like this is a very simple use case
for AI agents like July 2022 we were
playing with it yeah very simple use
case but just seeing it and just the

[02:02]
case but just seeing it and just the
context and the framing I don't know it
just set off this flurry of ideas for me
Isn't that interesting like I knew it
was possible but I just saw it and it's
like okay that's not the end idea like a
restaurant res reservation set but how
could you apply this it's because when
we played with it it wasn't good like it
was you could see that it was going to
be something good at some point but the
technology just wasn't there and I just
don't think we've adapted to how fast
this technology is changing cuz my mind
yeah air AI would still be what it was
two years ago and I haven't played with
it for two years so of course you're not
up to speed with like how good it
potentially is right now so from what I
saw honestly it was about as good as
when I was playing with it because what
was the same for me was the pause
there's still an awkward pause in his
video and when I played with it a year
ago and so I didn't see enough in the
video to know how much like Logic the AI
had but I know that the pause is like
the worst part because it's very very

[03:00]
the worst part because it's very very
unnatural okay sure but you can get
around that so I watch the video and
then I go over to that room and I start
doing the dishes and I'm just thinking
I'm just thinking I'm just scrubbing and
thinking and scrub I'm just thinking I
got the bubbly scub balls I'm scrubbing
the
glasses I got the silverware soaking in
the water anyway can we just talk about
how much we both love washing dishes cuz
it's like that mindless activity that
allows your brain in the backgr to like
run it makes us pretend like we're
halfway decent husbands for like an hour
well it solves the ADHD of us where it's
like oh I did a task and there's the
outcome like really quick you can see
the result of what you did like I I do
enjoy washing dishes the barbell
strategy is employed when I do the
dishes because I only do the dishes when
I'm in a good mood or a really bad mood
if F if I'm in a steady state I ain't
doing those dishes okay if I'm angry at
something I'm going to be scrubbing

[04:00]
something I'm going to be scrubbing
those dishes so
hard oh my gosh that's just me but I do
I I do enjoy it honestly so I'm doing
the dishes and I'm thinking and my kids
are like Dad what do you think about
this and I'm just like uhhuh like Dad
Dad and like I'm just thinking of ideas
I'm in the zone dad I love you I just
want to tell you one thing really
important yeah whatever dad mom left for
milk and she hasn't been back in seven
hours anyway dad do you still love me
because last night anyway sorry keep
going so who likes calling people on the
phone like to no one no one that's
Universal you're not special if you
don't like making phone calls right
talking to your friends is one thing but
to get something yeah yeah yeah to get
something done no nobody likes talking
on the phone and so I started thinking
how could we productize something like
this okay first of all remember what we
did with the stum stump grinding
business we had a virtual assistant call
every stump grinding company in Houston
and asked a few questions he surveyed
them how much would it cost would you
ever Outsource to us y y y it was really

[05:01]
ever Outsource to us y y y it was really
interesting we did a couple podcasts in
it it was like July if you want to go
back and listen we could do something
like that we could do like a business
idea validation um agent that calls up
businesses and asks you know does
research what is your pricing and all
that that was like my first level of
ideation what do you want to say no well
I'm smiling because you and I never
share notes beforehand and we didn't
this time either yeah this perfectly
integrates with like one of my ideas
perect so it's not the same it but it
does perfectly integrate I'm not going
to mention it yet but this is similar to
the idea that we had a couple of months
ago about the car negotiations yeah car
negotiations where we'd have a VA call
it's a VA it wasn't AI but it was a VA
calling around to like negotiate the
best prices on people's behalf so I like
where you're going keep going so that
was the first line of thinking it's like
okay well our audience they're business
owners they're aspiring business owners
you know we you know if someone wanted
to launch a home service business let's
say a plumbing business in Dallas they
could call around and you know what
percentage of people are answering their
phone because it doesn't even matter if

[06:01]
phone because it doesn't even matter if
there's a pause of no one's answering
you could just Mark that on a
spreadsheet you know how much is the
cost for a toilet replacement from 20
different plumbing companies let's
compare side by side and then it's like
okay but that's like it's not even that
it's too Niche because I'm you know I'm
cool selling stuff to aspiring business
owners but people just don't do this
we'd have to convince aspiring business
owners to do this type of market
research you know what I'm saying like
this is valuable to do we can help you
do it that's a lot of friction so I I
quickly moved out on from that okay okay
and then I start thinking like Mass
Market okay so what if you're a 24
year-old woman that's engaged and you're
planning a wedding you're going to be
making a lot of phone calls venues
catering photography flowers the venue I
knew you were going to say
that like the more people you call
theoretically the more money you save
because you're getting more quotes more
data points right but most people going
to call that many they're going to get a

[07:00]
to call that many they're going to get a
quotee that seems okay and then they're
going to stop okay right so then I start
thinking Mass market and it could be
like wedding planners or for people
planning a wedding um it could be a
service for them to call and this is
what the agent would do it would say
like you get ahead of the pause and it's
very important here it's like hey I'm
working on behalf of mallerie Smith
first name last name in city name very
important right I'm not you know some
random robot calling you trying to sell
you something she has a wedding planned
on March 31st I don't even think there
is a March 31st March 30 no there's a
March 31st okay dude doesn't even know
his month the days I don't know my month
hold on let me count my Knuckles let me
count my Knuckles oh okay yeah oh that's
a 31 Yep
this it's a bit it's a bit
now um Mohamed Mohammad edit this out
but actually don't because it's funny I
want people to hear
it don't edit that part out either cuz I
want them to hear it me telling you to

[08:00]
want them to hear it me telling you to
edit Kelly was just telling me we need
to have a safe word for what really
needs to be edited out I know anyway so
it's like okay so the agent calls and
it's like hey I'm calling on behalf of
mallerie Smith she lives here in Plano
Texas uh she has a wedding plan for
March 31st she's trying to get as many
and it's just like the first the intro
is just like a pre it's just a very long
Preamble because there's no pause you're
telling them like basically don't hang
up on me I'm an AI agent well you're not
even there yet but we're getting there
yes because they they probably don't
know in that first Preamble because
there hasn't been an opportunity for a
pause right sure so it's like hey I'm
helping her with this wedding she's
trying to get as many quotes as possible
uh I like a quote for X Y and Z
something very specific something that's
like their language right like 50 heads
uh we're budgeting for $15 to $20 per
head we want two appetizers a side and a
meat right and then it's like also at
the end of it now like you've got them
they're hooked at the end of it it's
like also I know this is weird but I am

[09:00]
like also I know this is weird but I am
an AI agent you're going to see a pause
in this conversation but ask me anything
you wish I'm going to report all of it
back to malerie and if your quote is
competitive she's going to give you a
call herself I knew these AI agents were
stupid I'm GNA see a pause okay I don't
know who this is I don't see pauses I
hear pauses Arnold Schwarzenegger's
calling it's
here I'm calling on some wedding
questions do I get to the chopper first
or second
uh anyway so you finish it you finish it
with like I am an AI agent I know this
is weird but like please ask me any
questions you wish um I am intelligent
um and I'm going to report all this back
to mallerie and she's going to call you
back herself if your quote is
competitive and then they like okay wow
this is weird Okay well our pricing is
okay well does that pricing include
silverware and it's going to ask all
these relevant follow-up questions and
it's literally checking boxes in a
spreadsheet and then they hang up and
then mallerie just gets an email summary
at the end of the day oh wow this one's

[10:00]
at the end of the day oh wow this one's
competitive yeah I'm going to give them
a call and it it's like the offer is the
no-brainer offer like we will save you
$5,000 on your wedding or like money
full money back guarantee if you don't
feel that we saved you any money I like
it being hyper Niche because you can
have an AI model that you can train so
even is her name go off the rails right
right right right but her name's malerie
in this instance sure sure okay so it's
like maler findes this and from the
beginning it's it's not just making
calls it's like all right mallerie have
you thought about this it's an inter
iterative and interactive process with
the AI agent to figure out what exactly
she's looking for and then based on that
set of parameters they can go out and
search for the venues in their area
because they're all now able to go out
and crawl the open web tell mallerie
here are the top five that I recommend
you call what do you think mallerie says
yes or no and then it goes out and
executes on that but because it's let's
say let's say it's just trained on
weddings it knows what questions to ask
you can you can train it to ask specific

[11:01]
you can you can train it to ask specific
dat like you can enter in your own
proprietary information if you're a
wedding venue or whatever it is I'm out
of my depth with the wedding stuff and
it's gonna ask questions that mallerie
wouldn't even think to ask because guess
what she's probably never been married
before you know yeah because you're
either gonna pay $110,000 for a wedding
planner or for most people you're going
to do it on the cheap and you're just
going to plan the wedding yourself this
is the AI wedding planner the Claude
wedding planner right like and they help
you plan everything related to the
wedding and they know what questions to
ask they don't a general price that it
should be right like how many times are
you pricing something out and you're
like I don't know is that good is that a
good price and yeah you don't know
Baseline yeah can go call the web and
say generally speaking this is how much
this should cost and then the more
people that you have using that product
it becomes a network effect because then
you're actually getting the data that
people spent so it can get proprietary
information to to level set and say this
is what Market is for these Services
anyways I I like it I like it a lot for
Nish down honestly it's like it could be

[12:01]
Nish down honestly it's like it could be
as simple as a chatbot and you can
integrate it with imessage with just a
text chatbot it's literally someone you
have saved in your phone and you treat
it like hey how much should catering
cost like in in Plano Texas one guy
quoted 30 bucks a person one guy quoted
seven like what is average and it will
have all this expertise to answer you
and then you can say okay go call 30
Caterers and I'm targeting 13 bucks
ahead okay I'll be back in two hours
okay you glossed over this you can
integrate it into your ey messages yeah
with text message I go right now and I
just open the app every single time with
chat GPT and I'm like hey blah but if it
was just integrated into my text
messages is it an iMessage or is it a is
it blue or green I think it's going to
be green Nick I
will
you we the 38% of Android users are
logging off right now they just they
just put their phone down and
unsubscribed that's I didn't know that I
didn't know you could how do you

[13:00]
didn't know you could how do you
integrate it with your Tex you got find
workarounds like I know for for the
average consumer I mean you could use
Lindy or you could use um zapier or
through twio through twio yeah that's a
tweet anyways sorry I I like that idea
put as a text message and then you're
just literally questioning it and it's
it's not like Google in the sense that
it's I ask a question it gives a
specific answer many times when you're
using these models Chachi PT Claude
Gemini they'll give you an answer and
then they'll ask you another question
right like oh did that answer or have
you thought of these things or would you
like me to plan X Y and Z right like it
does it's an interactive conversation as
opposed to just a one way asking answer
ask answer it's like ask answer ask back
yeah it's like it's chat GPT that can go
out and do things for you which to us is
like oh it's called an agent but to
99.9% of humans that is mindblowing to
them because it's like the the person
the mallerie that we're selling this to

[14:00]
the mallerie that we're selling this to
and I'm picturing two pricing plans one
to the woman who's planning her own
wedding and then one to the wedding
planner that's going to be a much more
high volume user they would need to pay
more right yeah that's a good one all of
these people like 20 to 40 year old
women is used to using chat GPT most
likely right but if you were to say hey
I want you to ask it like what an
average catering order costs okay I
could do that in chat GPT and then I
want you to ask it to go call 30
caterers in your area and Report back on
prices oh wait what how can it call and
then it's like well do you want me to
call you right now we'll do a sample
call yeah sure they'll pick up her phone
and she can play the role of a caterer
and she can just ask questions and just
see how good it is let me ask you a
question what percentage of the time do
you use Google and what percentage of
the time do you use an AI model chat GPT
Claude I almost never use Google anymore
unless I'm in Google Maps or there are
some exceptions that's what I think
searching for physical businesses I
think
yep and products like that I still use

[15:01]
yep and products like that I still use
Google for and I think I would bet even
even though our audience is probably
Tech forward 50% of them still don't use
chat GPT or an llm in the way that they
should be using it and I want to like
this is a perfect example I'm going to
give right now we bought our sons Apple
watches for Christmas they had the
little gizmos that were set where they
could only call like a couple of people
and they were fine for a period of time
but the GPS on them didn't work really
well and it was gay so we couldn't add
that many contacts to it there was a
certain number of contacts that it could
add and so we were like you know what
let's get the Apple watches for them
cool so we get them Apple watches for
Christmas but we still don't want them
calling everybody we don't want them
getting out to the to the open web um
and also we don't want them to have
access to the game center we don't want
them to um be able to receive calls but
we want them to be able to make anyways
there's like a whole set of things that
we wanted to set in order to gate their
experience if I went to Google and I
said how do I set permission parameters

[16:00]
said how do I set permission parameters
on the Apple watch for new watches I'm
going to get a list of articles that
were pre-written with somebody else's
idea in mind of what they thought I
might be asking so it's not going to be
exact there may be one article that's
like hey how to limit phone numbers cool
there may be another article that's like
how to make sure the game center is not
active and there may be another article
that says how to make sure the web isn't
available but Siri still is right
whatever it's a lot of clicks right it's
a lot of clicks and I've got to read and
I've got to then interpret internal and
then I got to do it myself I went to J
gbt and I wrote a long prompt I said
here are the things that exactly that I
want please give me a stepbystep process
to do this and guess what it was perfect
yeah I didn't even have to ask it a
second time and Jess was sitting there
with me and we went through it and it
was like okay go to your phone open this
setting Okay click on this this should
be this should be here go to the watch
very very easy and I think what most
people don't realize is is that change

[17:00]
people don't realize is is that change
is so enormous from hey here's an
article that might help you solve this
to this is the answer and then what
we're talking about on top of that is
this is the agent that will go out
execute this function and bring it back
to you with an answer it's two step
functions away from even Google at this
point even the people who are listening
to this I think probably aren't using
chaty PT enough yeah I mean you can take
it even a step further like I I was
making sourdough bread for the first
time it's a little complicated and I
pulled out my starter and it had like
deflated and I made the sourdough and
I'm like okay the consistency is kind of
weird and we're just having this
conversation and then I took a picture
of the sourdough and I'm like what does
this mean what does this mean and it's
like Oh and it what it told me is
exactly what it was it was like oh it's
because you didn't leave it out long
enough you need to do this you need to
feed it with 50% flour 50% water and
it's like how many chefs or how many
people cooking in their home kitchens
are even thinking to do this they're not

[18:01]
are even thinking to do this they're not
there's probably 20 30 apps in the app
store right now like AI enabled cooking
apps like this that offer this I bet you
there's room for like 200 more because
it's so
early early if you're listening to this
and you have an idea like this like oh
like a a cooking assistant app that's $5
a month that you can talk to and take
pictures of and then you go you're going
to go to the Apple App Store I've never
done this I just know you're going to
open and you're going to see dozens of
these and you're going to be
disheartened and you're going to move on
don't be
like press forward cursor. a is like the
website for specifically building iPhone
apps using Ai and it's like plug andplay
so there's just room for so much more
have you played with uh the chat GPT I'm
sure Gemini does this as well where you
can actually you just talk to it ask it
questions like verbally yeah when I'm
driving sometimes I will but not I'm not
trying to OV exaggerate it's I feel like
I'm living in the future because and I
have to do this I know this this is
going to sound so stupid I have to tell

[19:00]
going to sound so stupid I have to tell
myself I have access to what to whatever
I'm curious about let's say that I want
to learn about Bitcoin it's like all
right I have access to Satoshi I'm gonna
ask him questions and so I'll ask a
first question and Chachi PT will give
me the response but then I I can ask
follow-up questions so if I'm on a walk
or if I'm driving I can have a
conversation and it's like teaching me
as we're talking as if I have you know
Satoshi or whoever the PHD of the topic
that I'm most interested in and it's
giving me real information it's like a
it's like a course in my car which is
it's just nuts to me that I have access
to that right now like there's so much
ability to learn it's
crazy a lot of opportunity no so I love
that idea so I I bought a domain name
for it I bought a domain name for it so
I think you could do this with the
generalized name I'm about to tell you
and just focus on weddings and then go
broad from there or I think this could
be a standalone wedding product like we
talked about the domain name I bought

[20:00]
talked about the domain name I bought
are you ready yeah have you heard of do
not pay.com no so I mean do not pay is
like it's a nine figure company and they
started by just like it was an automated
service where you could dispute your
parking ticket in San Francisco that's
how Niche they started that's amazing
yeah now it and they've been funded by
like Sequoia and all the big names do
not pay.com I'm trying to see like what
they're purporting themselves to be your
AI consumer Champion do not pay uses to
help you fight big corporations protect
your privacy find hidden money and beat
bureaucracy this is a big company
started out very Niche so I was thinking
along those lines what could I name this
that's like it just stands out it says
exactly what it does a few syllables you
could start at Niche with weddings and
then go as broad as you want like they
did with parking tickets never call
again.com oh my
gosh I own it oh dude I'm
done I'm done

[21:00]
done I'm done
[Laughter]
are you freaking kidding me dude he's
he's gone are you freaking kidding me
dude it's a good one it's a good one do
not call again never call again never
call again never call oh gosh dang it
Chris it's so good good right it is so
good so it could also be like a monthly
membership like just to keep in your
back pocket 20 bucks a month it's like
oh our AC just broke I want 10 quotes
click I got 10 quotes but that name
though it's a good name but that name
though gosh dang it that's a good name
never call again.com holy crap so anyone
listening to this you're welcome to go
copy me but you can't you can't take the
name
so well I think this is GNA be an all AI
episode oh shoot okay we're doing this I
mean how could it not be it's so
transformative it is it's very trans all
right if you are watching this clip
right now you are watching this on
YouTube and if you are a fan of podcast
please check out my podcast while you're
at it because sometimes I have podcasts

[22:01]
at it because sometimes I have podcasts
that aren't on YouTube and sometimes I
have YouTubes that aren't on podcast so
check out the ker office on any podcast
platform or you can go to TKO pod.com
also my newsletter will throw that in
there there are no ads It's weekly it's
different content than my podcast and
YouTube newsletter. chrisj cerner.com
You'll see the link and we'll see you
there so is it my turn can I can I tell
I yes please all right so I was talking
to my my son about Roy I was talking to
Roy about Ai and and why it's important
and we you know we've been playing
around with it and I was like Roy you
know what's interesting is that knowing
the right question to ask is as
important as whatever answer you think
you want to get it's like really Nick
real quick I have this exact
conversation in the last week with my
kids really the exact conversation you
got to know what questions to ask it
could open up the whole world to you
yeah so we're sitting there we're
talking and you know I'm telling him Roy
you're curious I'm curious
I can't tell you how many times I've

[23:01]
I can't tell you how many times I've
asked a question and everybody else
who's sitting around me has been like
come on that's stupid but when we start
drilling into it it's it's like oh
nobody really knew the answer to that
question right like nobody and nobody
had thought to ask it because oh well
everybody knows the answer or it's just
seems so obvious and as we were talking
through I was like did you know that
there are jobs out there that people are
paid a lot of money for where they're
literally paid to figure out the right
question to ask for these llms to return
the right answer he's like really like
yeah they're called a prompt engineer
it's like well what did they do like
well these llms are very specific and so
you have to be very specific with the
parameters that you give them what does
the outcome look like what information
can they use and digest can it be
inferred does it have to be cited where
are they pulling the information from
all those things and so in order to get
the right answer you have to ask the
right question there these prompt
Engineers he like wow that's really
interesting and so he starts re
searching that and I started thinking

[24:00]
searching that and I started thinking
about this do you remember I don't know
if they still do it but do you remember
in the Apple Stores where they'd have
like Saturday morning classes and every
grandma would go and they bring their
iPad they still be like they still do it
okay this is how you access photos it's
like oh what are you my grandson you
know and they've got people telling them
what to do I think there's a world where
an entrepreneuring enterprising
entrepreneur could either do a physical
inperson or virtual class for Boomers on
how to use chat TPT M because right now
I mean even teenage kids that I've shown
how to do it they don't know how to use
it they use it for novelty they're like
oh can you spell
penis you know what I mean like this
just like they think it's something
funny that is pretty funny though I mean
come on it is it is pretty funny but
they don't but they don't know like okay
what else would I use this for like
what's I can ask the first question but
what's the next question how do I get
the most out of it and so if I was in
the space if I was in college in
particular and I wanted to hustle I

[25:00]
particular and I wanted to hustle I
would launch a business around educating
adults it doesn't even have to be
Boomers just adults on how to ask and
how to get the most out of chat GPT what
do you think absolutely like I'm
thinking of other variations of this
this is just a thought I had while you
were talking open AI is not about to
spend millions of dollars pushing paid
targeted ads
towards Boomers that don't know how to
use Chad gbd they've we got too much on
their PL or like or like a boomer that
wants to cook better with chat gbt
there's like no one at open AI That's
not on their radar right that's why you
want to build a rapper that can help
Boomers cook better with Chach PT and so
I'm thinking like a a Twist on your idea
is to just make a ton of rappers that
make the prompting easier that basically
prompt the old people to ask better
questions so like you download an app
for $9.99 and that's push to the Boomer
through paid ads the Boomer downloads it

[26:01]
through paid ads the Boomer downloads it
and then the app starts talking to them
and like basically pushes them along
what do you want to know and it does the
same thing as what you're saying but
through an app and not through a class
so I like the rapper I really do like
the rapper idea but the reason I like
doing this as a class is is because of
the reasons you know how when you post
stuff to Twitter and people are like
it's not that easy
bro actually what about insurance he
didn't think about the liability that's
going to come right and and you why
don't you do it if it's such a good idea
why don't you do it
bro like every time you post if I had to
start over again and make a $100,000
this year this is exactly how I would do
it step by step and then I text you I'm
like but could you do that please could
you do that please anyways I think that
someone would would hear this oh put a
rapper on it and and be like oh yeah I'm
gonna put a rapper and they start doing
a little bit of research and there's
friction and they're like H It's Kind
too hard I don't want I see what you're
saying for the person listening that
wants to start this that might be kind

[27:00]
wants to start this that might be kind
of a bridge too far yeah yeah but I
think if they started this within three
months they're they're going to be so
good at chat GPT they're going to be
like oh I could build a rapper I could
just have chat GPT even tell me how to
build a rapper I have all these tools
and resources to build a rapper I think
that's the iterative next step where I
would start with this is and you might
this might be too controversial I would
go to my local church that I'm a member
of and just say for free I'm not I'm not
asking for money can you loan me money
for this investment SCH
infin is that what you're never mind no
no I'd say God told me I'm supposed to
start this business that's what I'd
say I'd go I'd go and I'd say hey look
we do activities one of the activities
at kns I'd like to do is just show any
member of the ward or any member of the
congregation any member of whatever
Parish how to use chat PT can we put on
the books and I would just test it and I
would just see what the respons is like
did it work how was it received odds are
somebody in the in the congregation is
going to be like could you come and help
me do this a little bit more this week

[28:01]
me do this a little bit more this week
right and you'll get even more
experience doing that and then at some
point that that might Blossom out into
other business but I would that's where
I would test it first before I went full
bore into it and then from there I would
use the same distribution channels that
we've been talking about um since the
beginning of time email Twitter social
media Etc but if I didn't have those
things again potentially controversial I
would go to assisted and independent
living facilities
mainly independent living facilities
because assisted living facilities you
get people there who just are like
really aren't all there independent
they're still all there they just need a
little bit extra help and I would just
offer offer a free class and then I
guarantee at the independent living
facility after the class you'll get 10
people coming up to you saying I'll pay
you 50 bucks for a half of an hour if
you teach me how to do x y and z um
that's where I would start this business
if I didn't have a social platform do
you think it's that's the revenue model
is charging for your time like per hour
is it like a subscription back to what

[29:00]
is it like a subscription back to what
we were talking about I think to get
into it for like just a person listening
is's like oh I want to try this out yeah
it'd be for hour per hour I think
eventually there's a million things you
could do right you could create the
rapper you could have a subscription you
could I me we talked about this when we
were talking about recording stories in
these facilities you could create a
video of yourself interacting with them
and you know set these up around the
city for people to have like interactive
conversations so yes like it is you but
it's not really you you know but I think
the first step would be like all right
prove that you can generate some income
learn the product and the education
piece of it and then scale I like a lot
I think a lot of I think it would lead
to like more higher ticket things just
naturally right totally based on the
type of demographic that you're that
you're teaching to and the reason I like
it for somebody younger or somebody in
college is because I think it's going to
take six months to sort of present
itself on what the opportun is I don't
think it's like air apparent right now

[30:01]
think it's like air apparent right now
oh this is exactly the business model
that it's going to become and if it's
somebody like you or I and we leave our
jobs it's like I don't necessarily have
six months you know if somebody
listening to this they don't necessarily
have six months to just kind of mess
around and figure out what it's going to
be and then another six months until
it's monetizing to a point where they
can have income to pay their Mortgage
and pay bills and all that other stuff
so I think somebody young could do this
yeah I like it it's a good one oh Chris
I have one more idea on this I just
talked to Craig Fuller he's the he's the
founder of freight waves and if you
don't know what Freight waves is it's a
really cool business there's a million
podcasts out there you can go listen to
he's on my first million and others but
essentially do you know what a Bloomberg
terminal
is okay so Michael Bloomberg one of the
richest men in in the world made his
money by selling information faster than
anybody else he set up these terminals
around the world they were called
Bloomberg terminals they're this big
Hardware device and they had proprietary
information
that people used to make investment

[31:01]
that people used to make investment
decisions and and that's where he
started and now he has a media company
that he have Bloomberg markets you have
Bloomberg the publication all that other
stuff super expensive to use right the
terminals yeah very very expensive very
expensive think of Craig as like the
Bloomberg for Logistics and shipping so
he has a media brand which is Freight
waves where they put out information
industry Publications Etc and then
they've got a Bloomberg like terminal in
sonar is the name of the company but the
idea was that they're going out and
they're aggregating all this information
and they're giving it to people who
wouldn't have the ability to go out and
aggregate it otherwise all right it's
$100 million plus company totally
bootstrapped owns it 100% anyways it's a
really really cool business as I was
talking to him though I started thinking
what could we or what could somebody
build around this thesis which is unique
or proprietary that's the better word
proprietary information and what could

[32:01]
proprietary information and what could
some of those be one might
be Searcher sentiment so people who want
to buy a business that are out there
searching actively right now ETA is a
big deal in the in the SMB World
entrepreneur through acquisition thank
you entrepreneur ETA entrepreneurship
through acquisition what's ETA Searcher
sentiment like right now how would you
how would you get a survey of all the
Searchers how would you get all that
information um small business business
pizza restaurants I don't know how would
you get a sentiment of what those
business owners are feeling right now um
and the reason I I started bringing it
up is because Craig was Craig like
predicted the last four recessions
before anybody else was predicting them
because he had the logistics information
he knew what was shipping from China he
knew what Walmart was ordering he knew
the inventory was going to be on the
shelves because they had this
proprietary order flow that they were
tracking so it got me thinking about
kind of what could you build around that
small businesses um and back to the AI

[33:01]
small businesses um and back to the AI
agents I think if you had AI agents
going out and just
calling making the call and aggregating
the information on your ideas suck but
this one's a good
idea this idea right here bro this is
the one a billion it's a billion dollar
idea bro multiple 11 figure
idea I can't even count as high as it's
worth bro you um but if you
had the hard part about that business is
is you're an information business so you
have to Aggregate and collect the
information Craig was able to get the
information because he's plugged into
all these systems and he's getting like
real- time electronic communications for
what they're ordering right it's hard to
do that with sentiment so AI agents
going out collecting sentiment
aggregating that and then either selling
it as proprietary access or you as the
business are making investment decisions
based off of what you know ahead of time
I mean there's kind of a 100 use cases

[34:00]
I mean there's kind of a 100 use cases
but that's the idea what do you think I
can't listen anymore because I love this
idea so much and I'm just thinking of
ways to apply it so all right couple
schools of thought okay let me back up
so I was thinking of when I started LCD
cycle right and for those that don't
know LCD cycle I sold iPhone parts to
iPhone repair stores when I started that
business I started it by scraping every
single iPhone repair store in the
country and it was very tedious and I
ended up with a spreadsheet of 20,000
repair stores and I remember thinking
very distinctly at the time I know more
about this industry than anyone on the
planet right now who else is doing this
who else is scraping every iPhone repair
store and then analyzing the results and
then I called them or when I say I I
mean three virtual assistants called
them and started a $10 million business
all built on that one
spreadsheet okay you talk about one
chart businesses I'm talking about one
spreadsheet businesses I'm going to give
you one more example that you're not
going to say Chris a couple of years ago
partnered with John McAfee yeah the

[35:01]
partnered with John McAfee yeah the
crazy John McAfee they launched a token
it was called no BS crypto the whole
thesis was Chris was crawling Reddit
Instagram face Twitter whatever it was
right and he was getting sentiment about
coins from places that nobody had looked
and it was it was a very accurate
predictor of which coins would pop and
he got a meeting with John McAfee you
can go watch this video Chris has
recorded it a couple of times he even
got a me John mcy John was like nobody
can predict this okay show me your model
and within 20 minutes John was like
Chris I love you will you marry me and
they went they went into business
together but I meant show me your female
model like s
Crawford but yeah I mean you did that
with LCD cycle you did that with nobs
crypto it's about find one spread sheet
business it's a one spreadsheet business
okay so okay so my mind went there then
I went a level deeper and it's like okay
okay how you want to find The Sweet Spot
between a business owner that will

[36:00]
between a business owner that will
answer the phone right with few
Gatekeepers and a high enough ticket
size so let's say uh convenient
convenience stores right let's say we
want to analyze the sentiment of
convenience stores because there's
250,000 convenience stores in the US
it's like the biggest retail industry
there is second to restaurants okay
convenience being like 7-Eleven amm like
just a freaking gas station yeah like
independent convenience stores yeah yeah
yeah a lot of the independent ones
you're going to call and you're going to
get the owner right or like a nail salon
you're going to call and you're going to
get the owner there's no friction to get
to the owner okay I'm
listening just I knew you were staring
at me the second there 30 Mill no I was
here I was here so that's great because
you can get to the owner and you could
you could build a big business off this
you could say hey I'm gonna ask you five
questions about the sentiment of the
industry whatever it is let's say
convenience stores what what are your
like what is your sales velocity re

[37:00]
like what is your sales velocity re
recently like they got to be broad
enough questions to where they don't
feel like protective of it but they also
have to be specific enough to where it's
good data and then you're like hey and
in return I'm gonna send you an email
with a report of what everyone else is
saying about this it's such a perfect
offer because I need 30 seconds of your
time but I'm gonna spill the beans on
what everyone else is answering me like
why wouldn't they want that of course
they would so that's great because
there's 250,000 of them you can get to
them easily but it's not very high
ticket now in a sense it is because
they're business owners but what they're
selling is not high ticket so then I I I
go to the other end of the spectrum like
dentists okay tens of thousands of
dentists out there but you're gonna have
to go through receptionist I am we all
are in a sense you got to go through the
receptionist it's really hard to get a
dentist on the Fone but it's very high
ticket you can sell High ticket stuff to
dentists so then I thought lawyers I've
done this before I've scraped a list of
lawyers you get their cell phone numbers
quite easily there's not as much

[38:00]
quite easily there's not as much
friction to reach them but it's very
high ticket um and you can there's 100,
lawyers probably much much more and you
can just call them and ask them a list
of questions and then say hey where can
I email your answers to not your answers
but everyone else's answers aggregated
and then you opt them into your list now
you have a newsletter that like your
cpms cost per Mill AKA how much you can
charge for advertising on this
newsletter are insanely High because
it's all lawyers reading in order to get
the newsletter they have to answer the
questions in order to answer the
questions they have to get the
newsletter and so you're you're
aggregating the data and building a
newsletter at the same time and then you
can still like it's not all you have as
a newsletter the data itself is
incredibly valuable outside of the
newsletter and now you could do this
with agents you could click a button and
call a thousand lawyers over the next
five minutes everything that's done
right now when they're going out and
polling people is done off of Statistics
modeling the more people that you PLL
the more answers that you get the better
your model is however there is a

[39:00]
your model is however there is a
selection bias right so it's like it may
be that the people who are willing to
answer skew the data Etc whatever but
the more data that you can get the more
accurate of a picture it becomes and
when you're looking at these smaller
industries that are Niche that don't
have as many operators in them there's
not an economic incentive for you to
hire even somebody in the Philippines to
call these people and get answers but if
you have an agent and the cost is
effectively 10 cents a call all of a
sudden there's an economic incentive
there and you can Arbitrage the
knowledge Gap and that that's where I
think it's like super interesting to
start thinking about some of the ideas
there and again this was this was from
Craig and his original business and you
know the Michael Bloomberg esque
terminals of getting you information
timely and and implying this down so I
really like that idea this is a really
good idea so the downside of this idea
is the cost so I've been pricing this
out recently and you're probably going

[40:00]
out recently and you're probably going
to spend about 15 cents a minute for
these AI agents and they round up uh
some do some don't round up uh and so it
doesn't seem like a lot on the surface
but that can add up over time what if it
was like a 30- second call and you just
you knew you knew that there was going
to be friction and drop off and it was
like Hey I'm an AI you do the pitch I'm
an AI agent I'm gathering information on
your industry I anonymize it
and then I send you the report of a
thousand people who have also responded
to this are you interested yeah great
what's your email I'll send you the
survey oh it's John bsby
at.com perfect I'll see you soon Boop
hang up so it's like you're not even
doing the survey on the phone again that
would bring the cost down but also there
there is friction however you do get
their email Boop and um it's a lot
cheaper for you to send out that many
emails as it is to like keep them on for
a five minute survey as opposed to them
filling out the survey online so that

[41:00]
filling out the survey online so that
could be a way around it that's a good
idea yeah the the hard part would be
like transcribing the email wrong
there's going to be an error rate or and
like there's going to be a big
percentage that just doesn't click
through like they're not going to answer
the survey you know what I mean like yes
there there's a number of things that it
could be you just have to you have to AB
test it do both two different scripts
one just ask for their email and the
other one ask the questions and compare
the open rates and the costs and the
outputs but you could also tiar your
pricing right like to the end consumer
hey we've got this is the cheap option
we don't do a phone minute a five minute
phone conversation we send out the email
or we get really high quality data for
people who are willing to stay on the
phone and that's you know 10x the price
you know what I mean so it's like okay
$100 a month or do you want $500 a month
yeah you can do this with election
polling too you could do it locally you
could you could be like hm there is a
city ordinance that they're going to
pass and there's a vote for it by the

[42:00]
pass and there's a vote for it by the
city council what's sentiment like does
that make sense could I get people
rounded up and advocating on my behalf
like there's there's a million kind of
applica local applications that it could
be oh I'm running for the school board
or my son wants to raise money for his
whatever student project are there even
that many municipalities you could sell
this to well this is like 10 cities in
America 20 it's a little higher IET 30
30 to 50 Market yeah she hey
let's just delete this part of the
episode actually don't I'm joking this
is seriously a good idea cuz you could
sell this as a service to people you
could sell the data to people you could
build your own newsletter with it like H
yep it's the whole dynamic of the AI
colar changes when you're you get ahead
of it it's like hey you just own it an
agent you own it there's gonna be pause
there's GNA be pause it's awkward it's
kind of like what we've talked about
with building like marketing agencies
where it's like hey I'm a lot cheaper
I'm not 3500 a month because I use AI
yeah I use AI if when we were using
AI two years ago if we would have gotten

[43:01]
AI two years ago if we would have gotten
ahead of it hey just want to let you
know this is an AI agent the call going
to be a little weird there's GNA be some
pauses nobody would know what the freak
you're talking about what AI what are
you talking about AI now even if you use
the word agent they're still not going
to know but if you say AI they're going
to be like oh okay this isn't a real I
think 90% of people are going to
understand that there's a lack there
whereas two years ago there just wasn't
an education I would probably say like
because they're not even going to know
what agent means I think I would say
like it it's like it's as if you're
talking to chat GPT yeah that's what I
mean I would just say like hey I'm AI
I'm not a real person there's going to
be a little bit of a lag agreed like I'm
an interactive AI so like ask me
anything you want but I'm gonna you know
what I'm saying right agreed it's a good
one thank you thank you all right what
you think please share it with a friend
and we'll see you next time on the ker
office
