driving. I'm driving, but my car is
driving for me. So, I'm not being
dangerous. I thought I'd do a Q&A cuz
I've got like an hour drive.
So, let's do a Q&A. But, I got to be
able to see your
questions. So, I'm just going to sit
here and see if anyone
joins. And then if you join, you can ask
questions.
All right, we got two people in
here. What's up, guys? I'm doing a Q&A
or just a bro down. I mean, let's just
talk. I'm just driving and
uh I thought we'd just hang out a little
bit.
Let's
see. All right. Wow.

15. Okay. Good
morning. Good morning, everyone. My car
is in full self-driving. So, don't
cancel me for driving and being on my
phone, okay? But I thought I'd do a Q&A.
Uh the hard part might be reading your
comments.
Um, but
morning, how am I liking the Tesla? Uh,
I'm loving it. I've had it for almost 3
years. It's a Model S. Um, it I lost a
lot of money on it. I bought it at the
peak and it's probably worth 60,000,
maybe even more, less than what I paid
for it three years ago. So, that's a
little depressing, but it's really fun
to drive. Uh, hey Trusted Movers, what's
up? Above average
podcast has a tree care. Hey Haskin,
it's funny. I'm actually driving to a
tree job right

about my tree trimming business. So,

What cool things am I working on? Uh I'm
building a sport court in my backyard
and obviously I'm addicted to business
so I'm going to rent it out. I have to I
don't even have a choice. My hands are
tied. And then I'm building another
sport court further in my backyard
inside my metal shop that I'm going to
rent out as well. So, I'm I'm building
two pickle ball courts right now at the
same time, both on my
backyard. That's one thing I'm working
on. And then I'm working on a lot of
content,
obviously. Uh, how do I get in touch
with private
investors? Start DMing people on
LinkedIn. start thinking up well, you
know, friends and family that are
wealthy and calling them
up.
Um, what other questions do we have?
What do you want me to talk

[03:03]
about? All right. How is your AI
healthcare company going,
