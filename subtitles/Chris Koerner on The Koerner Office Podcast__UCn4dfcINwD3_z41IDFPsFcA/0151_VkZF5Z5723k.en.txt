it's $2,000 maybe 2500 you can put it on
a pedestal or you can mount it to a wall
it's about the size of a large mailbox
and it just looks like this it just it's
got like this glass display with five
bottles of cologne or perfume and then
there's a little tube going into each
bottle and then there's a credit card
reader and five buttons underneath each
one you swipe your card for a dollar and
you put your hand up to it or your neck
or whatever and you pay a dollar to get
one spray of perfume and it's so it's
like 90 plus%

you today where Nick and I talk business
ideas so hope you enjoy hope you have
fun please like And subscribe and we'll
see you next
time I got a couple ideas for you you
ready I'm ready you know Quinn Miller
the vending
Guyer yeah yep

[01:01]
Guyer yeah yep
so we just spoke
today and he owns ton of vending
machines in Southern California and he
does really well and he also owns a
bunch of ATMs so we talked all about
that business yada Yad Y and I asked him
what was the most interesting vending
concept you've ever seen and this blew
my mind he went to a bar in Lancing
Michigan once and he went to the
bathroom and they had they had like a
leaderboard display screen above the
Ural and they had a device in the urinal
that you pee into that measures the
strength of your pee and the volume of
your pee and then it ranks you against
other guys that have been to that bar
and you have to pay for
it and then it runs ads as your peeing
and you pay you you pay to pee and be
shown ads no freaking way yeah isn't
that amazing that is amazing cuz what
guy is going to be like I don't I'm not
feeling it right now I don't want to
know how my PE strength is I don't H it

[02:02]
know how my PE strength is I don't H it
doesn't matter to me my wife says it
matter no my
wife I I would lose this game because as
I'm getting older My Stream is not
strong my stream I'm like an inch thick
and just short burst like I just get it
out I've heard you pee it's aggressive
it's aggressive it's a Super Soaker like
the line in the other guys and the sound
of your piss hit in the urinal it sounds
feminine anyway I thought that was a
interesting no I'm not about to go
launch that but that's the most
interesting vending concept I've ever
heard of second one which I've talked to
you about and I like this idea I still
like it is the perfume vending machines
remember yeah I remember this yeah
they're based out of like Lavia or
Estonia or something they're only in
Europe Dubai Saudi Arabia Middle East
they're not in America yet it's $2,000

[03:01]
they're not in America yet it's $2,000
maybe 2500 you can put it on a pedestal
or you can mount it to a wall it's about
the size of a large mailbox and it just
looks like this it just it's got like
this glass display with five bottles of
cologne or perfume and then there's a
little tube going into each bottle and
then there's a credit card reader and
five buttons underneath each one you
swipe your card for a dollar and you put
your hand up to it or your neck or
whatever and you pay a dollar to get one
spray of perfume and it's so it's like
90 plus% margins because those bottles
have like 300 sprays in them right okay
and then in addition you can play ads on
it and then you can put QR codes
underneath each bottle to like Oh I like
that smell I want to buy that and it's
just an affiliate link you don't it's
not an e-commerce business you don't
have a website it's just an affiliate
link for you to make 10 bucks every time
you sell a
bottle what do you think

[04:00]
bottle what do you think
as I thought about it here's what I hate
about that
business where are they can you describe
it
again what type of venue just tell me
geography where they are Europe
smelly yep keep
going keep going with what what do you
want me to say where the other place
where's the other place you said there's
the other places okay Middle East places
where they don't wear deodorant places
deodorant like we wear deodorant here we
don't stink as bad so it's it's like oh
Ivan you stink very bad go to bathroom
get little sprits of perfume like yeah
okay those guys freaking need it have
you smelled a guy after he's had
borche it's not it's not good dude but
do people in America buy perfume in
Cologne yes or no if I had to answer
that if I had to answer that
yes okay I just asked chat GPT and it's
looking good for you so far I said what
country countries sell the most cologne

[05:01]
country countries sell the most cologne
and perfume number one France largest
exporter largest exporter exporter get
out of here
Chad
Spain I mean I completely agree the big
risk here is the cultural thing but
here's I think you could solve that
solve for that by placing these in 10 to
20 different locations and just learning
because I think in the right location
even in America these could do really
well I was talking to Sam about this and
he's like I keep a bottle of col in my
gym bag when I go to the gym I just I
don't want to shower but I don't want to
stink so I just I give a little spray so
if there was one of these in the
bathroom or at the exit and I might use
it or I'm thinking like just in like a
very busy mall like just a pedestal in
the middle of the mall because You' got
youths you've got these you know those
youths walking around they might be
interested in this or even like next to
the line at the Cinemark at the movie
theater and people are standing next to
it in line I'm all about incentivizing
less cleanliness all right so if I go to
the gym I work up a sweat little

[06:02]
the gym I work up a sweat little
Spritz shower I I followed up with Chad
GPT and this one's not looking good for
you
okay I said no tell me consumer
purchasing it says number one the US is
a major market for perfumes and colognes
country accounted for 8.7 billion in
fragrant sales 2023 Brazil number two 4
billion so half as many people and half
as much perfume and cologne France
