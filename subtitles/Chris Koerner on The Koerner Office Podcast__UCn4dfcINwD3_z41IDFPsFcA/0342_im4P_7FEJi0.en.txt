you guys have to see what I found so
this mom to be tediously assembled a
list of every single company that might
send her free stuff after receiving her
baby shower invitation here's your
business idea this same thing works for
wedding invitations as well so here's
what you do assemble a list of every
single company that may or may not send
people free stuff for their wedding
invitation or free stuff for their baby
shower invitation there's going to be
hundreds of companies then you're going
to throw up a quick website using card
webflow or Shopify where people can go
and pay you a flat fee to send out all
these invitations on behalf of them
here's where it gets good you don't need
to be addressing and mailing all these
invitations you're going to wh label
this service to another company that
already does this or if you don't want
to deal with a hassle you can just sell
the list of companies that ship free
stuff to people for $19 or $49 you're
just charging for the convenience of
assembling this list and saving them
time mailing these out they can look
generic it doesn't matter it's a numbers
game if you're about to get married or
have a baby would you pay a couple
hundred bucks in the hopes that you
might get dozens of free gifts from
companies of course you would no one's
doing this full business plan here
