look at these freaking guys right here
guys what are we doing rushing to Costco
to buy Pokémon or Lego sets in the hopes
that you'll flip them for a few bucks
here's why I love this idea and why I
hate this idea I'll take both sides of
this argument this is day 20 of showing
you 202's best business idea so follow
for more I love this idea because it
gets people in the game once you make
your first dollar in entrepreneurship
your brain is rewired and you will never
be the same and that is a beautiful
thing that's why I love this idea why do
I hate this idea because this is a lot
of effort invested in flipping limited
edition things on the internet so use
that as your gateway drug but don't stay
on that find something that's a little
more scalable and more enjoyable get all
my business ideas for 2025 right here
