[00:00]
what if I told you there's a service
business that enjoys 100% gross profit
margins and costs almost nothing to
[Applause]
start I'm Chris ker I've started over 75
businesses in the last 15 years three of
them being worth over $10 million today
we're going to zoom in on the firewood
business and how you can sell it all
year round and start it with almost Z
and then we're going to zoom out on
Creative growth hacking techniques and
how you can grow exclusively on Facebook
Marketplace without even needing a
website let's Dive In
about six years ago as a favor to a
friend here in Dallas Fort Worth I
helped them start a tree trimming
business and at the time I was starting
a software business and I was like oh
software is sexy recurring Revenue High
multiples all the while my friend with
this tree trimming business was making
tens of thousands of dollars a month and
I'm banging my head against the allall
and so a couple years later I went to
Twitter just thinking of something to
post and I did this viral through that

[01:00]
post and I did this viral through that
was called how to make $300,000 in 2023
a tree trimming business and it got me
so excited to write about this
experience that I went and started
another tree trimming business with a
business partner named James that became
fast Tree Care here in Dallas Fort Worth
and it grew really fast and we love home
services and starting a tree trimming
business got me looking at other
tangential opportunities like firewood
firewood is an amazing business the cost
on the firewood is essentially 0 because
tree trimming companies not only do they
get rid of the wood that they cut down
but they pay a dump to take it so when
you approach a tree trimming company and
say Hey you know how you're paying the
dump right now to take all your Oak and
your Pine and your Ash why don't you
just give it to me for free and I'll
sell it as firewood it's a great offer
it's a win-win and so I went to a church
function a couple months ago and I was
talking to some high school kids and
they're like Chris Chris you know all
about businesses teach us what to start
how do how do we start a business and I
start asking them well what do you want
to start what do you like and they had

[02:00]
to start what do you like and they had
no idea they didn't know where to start
I have more ideas than I have time so I
coincidentally we were splitting logs at
this church activity for an elderly
gentleman and you know some people take
trt to get their testosterone and I just
like using heavy equipment and log
splitters so we were using a log
splitter much like this this beautiful
thing is a 27 ton log splitter with an
11 second cycle time which means it
takes 11 seconds to split a log so it's
kind of funny because we're talking
about business ideas business
opportunities pressure washing window
washing house cleaning all the while
we're splitting wood and I own a tree
trimming business and I have 3 acres of
land and so then it just hit me it's
like why don't we start a firewood
business I'm a barbecue efficient Auto
you can sell firewood to barbecue
restaurants or barbecue smokers or you
could just sell firewood to homeowners
we started talking terms and here's what
we agreed on I'll fund everything I'll
buy the log splitter I'll buy everything
you can use my land for free there's no
rent I'll find the customer customers

[03:00]
rent I'll find the customer customers
for you I'll Mentor you I'll teach you
about about business and you do all the
hard stuff you split the logs you cut
the
logs and I'll just be the guy on camera
pretending like I'm doing all the work
right they were happy with that I'm
happy with that so here we are so they
came to me day one they're like Chris
let's buy a log splitter how much are
they 1,600 bucks okay how many customers
do we have well do you have any
customers for us yet no but we got to
get some wood so I reached out to James
he owned our tree trimming business and
I said James what do we have in the
pipeline we're taking down two oak trees
I'll have some wood in your backyard
next week showed up there was some wood
back here the guys came over Devon and
Cade and they started cutting up the
wood so then they put the ball back in
my court they're like all right Chris
we've got wood we are our customers what
are you going to do Chris and I said
well I'm going to go to Facebook
Marketplace because you can run an
entire business on Facebook Marketplace
without having to need a website and
here's another brilliant part about this
business business if for some reason we

[04:01]
business business if for some reason we
can't sell one stick of firewood we can
rent out this log splitter this rents
for about 70 to $100 a day to tree
trimming businesses homeowners land
clearers people that want to split their
own firewood so I knew that worst case
scenario if I suck at selling firewood
we can surely find someone to rent this
out or we could just sell it on Facebook
Marketplace and be done with it all
together I love finding businesses that
have such a low FL floor a high ceiling
but a low floor cuz a lot of people
think oh I I start a business I've got
to quit my job I've got to go buy a skid
steer or a $2,000 log splitter but you
don't there are always creative ways to
start businesses that mitigate your risk
from the outset so what you're looking
at right here is about a cord of
firewood a cord is how firewood is
measured a cord equals 8 by 4X 4T half a
cord being 4X 4X 4T a lot of times
consumers or homeowners they can't

[05:00]
consumers or homeowners they can't
really conceptualize what a cord is and
so we'll just describe it to them as a
half a cord being about the bed of a
truck because if you think about a bed
of a truck it's about 2 feet tall by 4et
wide by 8T long give or take and so two
beds of a truck would be a full cord
pricing in north Texas is about $450 to
$500 for a cord or about $250 to $300
for a half cord so the smaller you go on
sizes the more you can charge per stick
so what you're looking at right here is
about 10 ft by 3T tall from the top of
the pallet to the top of the sticks and
4T wide we love using pallets for a
couple reasons a pallet is 48x 40 in so
we know that if a cord is 4X 4x8 and we
stack everything on a pallet then we can
at least get that 4ot part of the
dimension accurate and if we put three
pallets side by side then we know we can
get about eight feet on the other side
of the dimension the only thing this

[06:00]
of the dimension the only thing this
cord is missing is about one more layer
of sticks this is about 3 feet tall
whereas it needs to be four to be a
complete cord we'll be delivering this
to a customer in mckin just this
afternoon now you'll notice that we're
stacking these very specifically this is
not by accident so wood needs to be
seasoned you can't just cut down a tree
like this and split it up and go deliver
it that is one of the downsides of this
industry but it's also an upside because
you can plan for it now working with
tree trimming Crews to Source our wood
does bring some challenges that you need
to work around a tree trimming crew will
typically cut up their logs based on how
thick it is in other words they'll cut
it up based on How likely they are to be
able to carry it from place to place we
need to shift that mindset if we start
working with them because we really need
our sticks to be about 16 in long 14 is
okay 18 is okay anything below or above
that really doesn't work because the

[07:01]
that really doesn't work because the
dimensions of the cord will be thrown
off entirely so we have to train these
tree triming Crews that we work with to
cut the logs in 16 in it doesn't matter
to us if a log is this big around or
this big around we need it to be 16 in
long so we can split it accordingly now
we stack these about three to four
sticks at a time in alternating
directions this is for several different
reasons obviously it will rain out here
sometimes if we stack the wood too
tightly then mold can start to form and
it will slow down the seasoning process
seasoning is just a fancy way of saying
drying it out you can buy mobile kils uh
to speed season wood uh you can attach
them to shipping containers either 20 or
40 foot these cost about 20 to
$25,000 but it will save you time we
would much rather prefer to plan in
advance um cut down trees in the spring
to sell in the fall or the winter and
vice versa so you can season wood by
just waiting 3 to 12 months letting

[08:01]
just waiting 3 to 12 months letting
nature do its job the hotter it is
outside the quicker it the season or you
can use a portable Kiln like these shown
here or the more expensive way if you
really want to scale this business is to
build an a fixed Kiln these can cost up
to hundreds of thousands of dollars but
enables you to season wood in as little
as a week A lot of times what we see in
the firewood industry is as you grow as
you scale you go from kind of a backyard
operation
to a mobile K operation to an affixed
Kil operation right now we're content
just doing it on my property now I
wanted to give you some perspective on
what a cord of firewood looks like when
it's still in the tree form now this is
an American elm tree it doesn't make for
great firewood cuz it burns off really
Smoky not cleanly like Oak does but
nonetheless it's a good representation
of what about a half court of firewood
looks like so if we were to cut this up
in 16-in logs like we instruct our tree
cruise to do you'd get about 20 sticks

[09:02]
cruise to do you'd get about 20 sticks
per log here at the base and it would
slowly taper up to about 10 sticks per
log up here you shake out to about 250
to 350 sticks for this tree that's what
we call our logs after they're already
split and 250 to 350 uh sticks equate to
about half a cord of firewood usually
about 600 is a full cord so you're
looking at about $250 to $300 worth of
wood right
here so we're a little spoiled because
we own a tree tring business so if we
need more logs we can just get more logs
from our own business not everyone has
that luxury but anyone can pick up the
phone and call or text a tree triing
business and say hey let me get some of
your logs especially Oak especially the
hardwoods but let's say for whatever
reason you're in a seasonal Market it's
winter time people are buying firewood
but people aren't cutting down trees
you've got to get creative um what we
like to do is we will look up the trash

[10:02]
like to do is we will look up the trash
schedule for any given municipality and
try to see when their bulk pickup day is
most municipalities will have one day a
month or two days a month call it the
second Tuesday of every month where you
can put your brush or your logs or your
big trash out by the street and they'll
come pick it up so let's say we look at
plano's website and we see that the
second Tuesday of every month you can
put brush out by the street for free so
we'll go the Monday before that Tuesday
and just start kind of hunting looking
around um for logs particularly large
oak trees and after you've been doing it
a while people are more likely to
proactively give you a call and say hey
you guys are looking for logs right come
get this one come get that one so right
now we're just kind of driving around
this neighborhood in mcken Texas um
looking for logs out by the street or
branches out by the street now firewood
can be a little tricky because you can't
just turn anything into firewood you you
really want to have at least 10 in in
diameter here so a lot of times people
just trim their trees and they put
branches out and it's really no use to
us but if we see some logs out by the

[11:01]
us but if we see some logs out by the
road that's usually a pretty good sign
now I asked my guys to leave me some
logs to split because who doesn't like
watching that but they left me this big
ugly honking piece now if I were
responsible I wouldn't split this
because you're only supposed to split
with the grain and this is obviously
half with half Against the Grain but
I've never claimed to be responsible so
I'm going to do it
[Applause]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
so before I start any business that
might rely on Facebook Marketplace for
leads I want to do some competitive
market research I need to know is there
more demand than there is Supply in both
my market and Benchmark markets that
have similar demographics and simil
similar population sizes so I'm doing
research for Plano Texas which has about
290,000 people in it Frisco and mckin
are cities that have similar
demographics and similar population
ation sizes that just happen to be right

[12:01]
ation sizes that just happen to be right
next to Plano so mckin has 215,000
people and fris has 225,000 people
they're similar with race age income
demographics so it's a perfect barometer
to know how many competitors am I going
to have if I start XY or Z business that
has to rely on Facebook Marketplace for
leads so I'm going to make a very simple
Google spreadsheet here to keep track of
these listings in competitive markets
then when I set a radius on Facebook
Marketplace I'm going to make it a tight
radius because I don't want to account
for firewood companies an hour away that
might deliver to Plano Texas I I only
want to know which ones are in Plano
Texas because that's the only way I can
keep my variables constant Facebook is
going to show me some listings that have
firewood in the title some that have it
in the description so I'm going to have
to use my common sense to know before
clicking if this is a relevant listing
to me or not so when I search firewood
Plano Texas this within 5 miles here are

[13:00]
Plano Texas this within 5 miles here are
the listings that I see that have Plano
listed in the title I don't want to see
Richardson and then click into it and
see we deliver to Plano I'm trying to
save time here and be efficient and get
the 8020 of This research without
spending four hours so I'm just going to
look at the title so I'm not going to
worry about prices yet because some
people list it as free or as $1 just to
get more clicks I just want to see
listings so right off the bat in Plano I
see one two 2 3 4 5 6 7 I see 14 I don't
want to keep scrolling I don't want to
go to page two because I'm just going to
see listings that are less relevant to
what I'm looking for so I'm going to go
back to my spreadsheet I'm going to put
14 under number of listings and then I'm
going to do the same search in Frisco if
I go to Frisco I see 21 listings very
interesting because Frisco is smaller
than Plano yet it has 50% more
competition so already after 5 minutes
of research it's telling me what I need
to know 21 listings in Frisco and then

[14:00]
to know 21 listings in Frisco and then
mckin will be our last Market 28 okay
for some reason these are all multiples
of seven we go to McKenna and it looks
even more competitive than Frisco now
this is why launching a business in your
home area is so critical because if I
were not native to the Dallas Fort Worth
area I've been here for 10 years then I
might look at this and say oh wow it's
so obvious I need to launch in PLO
because there's no one doing this in
Plano but since I'm a local I know
things like okay mckin has a huge
surface area there's a lot of rural
areas it's further from Dallas so homes
are cheaper there's more vacant acreage
there's more room for someone to start
and run a firewood business Plano is
right up against Dallas it's a little
more urban the lots are much smaller um
there's more infill there's just there's
not a lot left to build in Plano so the
likelihood of someone starting a
firewood business in Plano is much
smaller than someone starting a firewood
business in Frisco or mckin but this is
this is a good thing if I'm in Plano

[15:00]
this is a good thing if I'm in Plano
this means that there's an opportunity
for someone in Plano to start a business
a there are Less Direct competitors
nearby B they're closer to Dallas where
there's two or three million more people
so I'm going to do some quick division
here and see what we're working
with okay so there's one firewood
business for every 10,700 people in
Frisco Plano one in every 20,700 people
and in mckin one in every 7,600 people
so this is interesting because I've done
this research for our tree trimming
business already and I know that one in
10,000 is a pretty good Benchmark if I
launch in Allen Texas which has about
100,000 people I can expect there to be
about nine
competitors 100,000 divided 10 equals
10,000 so it is kind of curious seeing
that the numbers for firewood businesses

[16:00]
that the numbers for firewood businesses
are very similar and perhaps that's
because a lot of the tree trimming
businesses are vertically integrated and
they're selling firewood as well so
right off the bat I know that if I'm in
Plano I'm I'm just going to have an
easier time selling this firewood it
doesn't mean I'm I'm going to be more
likely to make the business work it just
means I'm going to have less competitors
and all else equal I would prefer to
have less competitors one of the most
ignored marketing channels is the most
obvious it's right in front of us this
is a busy road that I happen to live on
conveniently we're splitting all the
wood in my backyard and we live on this
road that gets about 23,000 cars to
drive by every day here's why that's
important advertisers value your
eyeballs based on a CPM basis CPM stands
for cost per Mill or cost per thousand
for a billboard or some driveby
advertising like this that might be
worth about $20 per thousand cars so if
23,000 cars drive by here every day
that's 23 * 20 which which is about $500

[17:00]
that's 23 * 20 which which is about $500
a day worth of advertising that's a lot
of advertising but me as the vertically
integrated Advertiser in this case I
want to get a 3 to 7x Raz which stands
for return on ad spend so if I put $500
into marketing I want that to return $2
to $4,000 for me so as the owner of the
business that I happen to be marketing
this drive by traffic is worth $2 to
$4,000 to me that would be like selling
four cords worth of firewood how do you
advertise out on the road without
getting fined by the city or by your HOA
if that happens to be the case well you
can wrap your vehicle but that costs
about $1 to
$33,000 another more creative option is
to get magnets for your vehicle you can
get multiple magnets with the same image
so you get about half of the effect of a
wrap at about 80% less cost then you
park your vehicle out by the road no one
can get mad at you for doing that and
you've got a free billboard right here
in your front yard now that doesn't

[18:00]
in your front yard now that doesn't
apply to people living in neighborhoods
or on culde saacs or everywhere but you
can always find properties that let you
park or let you put up a sign or let you
lease a little bit of space out by the
road if you want to know how much
traffic any road gets you'll need to
navigate to the Department of
Transportation website for whatever
state it is that you live in I'm in
Texas so if I pull up the Texas
Department of Transportation
website I'm going to type in the city
where I live and navigate to my street
now this isn't the street that I live on
cuz I don't want you to know where I
live but I picked a comparable Street
here in the area that gets 26,000 cars
to drive by every day when you click on
that number the Department of
Transportation will show you what the
history of the traffic has been on that
street over the last 10 to 20 years now
I'm going to talk about listing
strategies not just for Facebook
Marketplace but this applies to any
Marketplace maybe you're selling on
Airbnb or on eBay all of these
principles apply to any Marketplace the

[19:00]
principles apply to any Marketplace the
three most important things you can ever
do when listing anything for sale or
rent on Facebook Marketplace or anywhere
are these number one pictures you have
to take high quality pictures you don't
need a professional photographer but you
need professional looking pictures even
if it's with your iPhone take note of
whatever Marketplace you're on how many
pictures or videos do they allow you to
upload keep in mind that these companies
are a lot smarter than us if eBay allows
us to upload 24 photos then they know
that the diminishing returns happen
after 24 photos and it also means that
the most optimal amount of photos or
videos to upload is about 24 so don't
upload three even if a lot of your
photos look about the same just the
angles are slightly different upload all
of them because it does you no harm also
it's called multimedia for a reason you
don't only want to upload a picture or a
video or multiple pictures or multiple
videos upload everything pictures and
videos from multiple angles especially
because the AL gorithms will prioritize

[20:00]
because the AL gorithms will prioritize
specifically Facebook Marketplace will
prioritize listings that lead with a
video because it will stop the scroll
all of these companies want us to stop
scrolling and if we're scrolling and we
see a bunch of pictures and then a video
even if a 1 second loop we're going to
stop there so a the algorithm will
prioritize it B people will prioritize
it because it looks better so if
Facebook Marketplace enables us to
upload 12 pictures of videos then up
upload two videos and 10 pictures or six
and six take advantage of everything
that Facebook allows us to do number two
description you've got to nail as many
keywords as you can so I want to put in
my listing Hickory Oak Post Oak scrub
Oak Ash American ash Elm everything even
if it's not firewood that I sell I still
want it in the listings so I can get
more visibility on my listing and the
third most important thing is
responsiveness the quickest to respond

[21:00]
responsiveness the quickest to respond
will win if your notifications aren't
completely blowing up you up on your
watch or your phone or everywhere then
you're going to miss out on not just
leads but money you have to respond to
these guys quickly the Facebook audience
is more impatient and more finicky than
any other audience so take advantage of
that because the people you're competing
against I guarantee you are not going to
be as responsive as you so let's go into
some of these listings here and I'll
critique some of my competitors I click
on one and I can already see it's a
blurry photo like I can barely see it's
firewood he only has three photos this
is taken in the dark the lighting is
terrible um his description firewood for
sale in Plano 1/8 chord or 1/4 chord
pickup or delivered call text Matt for
pricing hidden information here's what
hidden information means it means that
Matt the guy who posted this put his
phone number in there not knowing that
you shouldn't do that Facebook doesn't
want to pull people away from Facebook
so if you put your phone number in there
even if you kind of put weird line
breaks in there they can detect it and
they will suppress not just your actual

[22:02]
they will suppress not just your actual
phone number but they'll suppress your
listing so it doesn't appear as often
for as many people so you're doing
yourself a disservice if you try to
circumvent Facebook you want to work
with Facebook not against them remember
there are one trillion doll company so
what I want to do is encourage people to
DM me on Facebook and then have all my
notifications set up because the
algorithm will also know that I'm trying
to keep people on the Facebook platform
and they're going to prioritize my
listings as a result I also
I want to list all of my prices okay
this means you're going to get less
clicks but you're going to get higher
intent clicks there's always a push pull
happening between friction and the
intent of a potential lead or a customer
if I put hardly any info in here it will
lead to more leads but those leads will
be much more weak they're going to be
less intent they're not going to want to
spend money with me and I'm going to
spin my wheels and waste my time so put
enough relevant information in there to
trigger all the keywords that people are

[23:01]
trigger all the keywords that people are
searching for and to incentivize someone
to reach out to you to close the sale
but don't put too much in there to where
there's nothing left up to the
imagination now I'm going to show you
what I did with my listing so and kind
of walk you through what I was thinking
as I did it so you'll notice that a lot
of the other listings just said firewood
in the title that is wasted real estate
that's like owning a block of Manhattan
and grazing cows on it makes no sense
you want to put a skyscraper there take
advantage of it I want to use every
character I can in the title because
those characters are 10 times more
valuable than your description they
don't have to click to read it so I put
cheap firewood free delivery help us
save for college that's the name of the
business college fund firewood I broke
every rule in my naming criteria when I
named it that I usually like to have
short easy to remember easy to spell
three syllable or less uh names but but
this I wanted to sell the story in the

[24:01]
this I wanted to sell the story in the
name what is the story the fact that I'm
helping two high school kids save money
for college the whole story is told
simply in the three-word name of the
business so if you look at the
description I say exactly what I'm doing
I'm helping two boys at church Devon and
Cade I put the first names in there for
a reason these are real people I'm not
making them up um you can meet them um
start a firewood and barbecue wood
business now I'm not just describing
what I'm doing here these are just
keywords I'm looking for more search
traffic so they can learn about business
and save for college they split and
stack firewood in my backyard and I help
them learn about business I also help
them sell it which is why I'm posting it
here now if I were an orthodontist I
don't want to tell people that I'm I'm
doing it out of my backyard or out of my
house or that I just got my degree
that's a completely different strategy
but this is a home service business
people are good they want to help other
people I want to play on that I want
them to know that they are helping a
real person save for a real education

[25:03]
real person save for a real education
instead of just another businessman that
I'm competing against and then I say
what the pricing is um and I said you
can buy wood from anyone but don't you
want to support young aspiring American
entrepreneurs free delivery within 30
miles please let me know if you have any
question we can deliver only oak or
pecan if you only need it for barbecue
smoke smoking wood and then the picture
I put in here is a picture of the actual
wood it's not pulled from Google Images
this tells people that we're actually
doing this um and you can see I put a
picture in here of the young men that
I'm helping uh Devin and Cade so they
can see these are real people and when
they come to drop off the firewood
they're going to see these two guys one
of the most untapped marketing channels
is also on Facebook but it's not
Marketplace it's Facebook groups most
people have no idea how many different
Niche Facebook groups there are on a
geographic per Market basis if you take
Plano Texas for example all I did was

[26:00]
Plano Texas for example all I did was
search Plano Texas under groups and I
see dozens of groups Plano Foodies
byyale trade a Spanish Plano Group Plano
Texas job hunting these groups are
critical because it is people that live
in Plano there there's a high likelihood
that these people are your future
customers the quality of these groups
will depend on how strict the moderating
is the best thing you can do is join
these groups and start add start asking
engagement bait questions such as hey I
own a tree triming business and I want
to take my guys out for tacos what are
the best tacos in Plano you'll get a ton
of responses because food is very
opinionated and polarizing or you can go
in there and say hey what are the best
neighborhoods in Plano to raise a family
where are the best neighborhoods for
school districts in Plano what happens
when you ask these questions is that the
Facebook algorithm will eventually it
usually only takes about a week tag your
account as a top contributor and give
you a badge which means after you earn

[27:02]
you a badge which means after you earn
that Badge Of Trust from Facebook you
can start posting more deliberate salesy
questions such as hey I've been in here
for a little while um thanks for
answering all my questions I own a
firewood business I'm trying to support
my family I'm a school teacher I'm
saving for college whatever your actual
story is tell it and people will want to
support you and the algorithm will

two I'm Cade I'm a senior uh I'm going
to go on a mission for my church and
also I've got college so just kind of
both things of you know funding my
current h IES as well as what I'm going
to do in the future MoneyWise the idea

[28:02]
to do in the future MoneyWise the idea
of creating a business like you hear all
the time people you know you know
starting a business or you know created
this thing and now I'm making a bunch of
money and it's like it always seems like
such a foreign like thing like how is
that like how do you even do that and
then Chris came along and I didn't even
know like I knew Chris that he was uh an
entrepreneur but I didn't really know a
whole lot lot about he what he did I
didn't know that he had a podcast and
did created all this content about
starting businesses so we were up at a
camp out a young men's camp out me and
my partner Devin and we were sitting
around doing the service project and he
started talking man like man like you
could I bet you could start you know
live streaming this or even selling
firewood or whatever and we should start
a business so then he was like all right
I'll buy a a splitter and you guys start
running this business and we'll kind of
go from there so you know ever since you

[29:01]
go from there so you know ever since you
know kept talking about it and
eventually rented a log splitter and got
some wood and another big thing is he
has a tree triming service as well so
you know basically we've got all the
free resources and all we got to do is
the manual labor and then go deliver it
and find customers and he said you guys
do all the work I'll find customers I'll
get you all squared away there and then
you know we worked out a deal and yeah
now we're making our first delivery and
it's pretty exciting wheelbarrow or
dolly is the most efficient way to
transport this wood but it really
depends on the setting right the setting
we're at here we have to stack the wood
up on a pre-existing firewood rack which
means the most efficient way to do
things is just to stack up all the wood
you can and then you can just drop it in
one movement so I used to own a company
called sendit that was a thirdparty
logistics company where we would pick
pack and ship orders on behalf of other
brands and the name of the game in that
industry is is eliminate as many
movements as you can so if we stack

[30:01]
movements as you can so if we stack
these all up in a wheelbarrow or in a
tote or on a dolly we got to unload
stack it move it bring it to the rack
unload it whereas when you just you take
a third of the amount and you put it in
your arms you only have to do that once
so it's a little it's a little more
trips but it's less time per trip and
you net out ahead so we'll do both just
so we don't use the same muscles for
everything but sometimes the the harder
way is the better way
