eight segments you're going to love
[Music]
it hi Chris thanks for having me on so I
have a side gig selling grants to
companies primarily around the north
Texas area uh currently the only way we
can find companies that qualifies is by
physically driving around and looking at
buildings because for a company to be
worth talking to they need to be a small
business have high utility bills own
their own building and be low located in

[01:00]
their own building and be low located in
certain zip codes you seem to be a king
of uh scraping the internet for
companies how could I scrape for any or
all of those parameters thanks Mike
thanks for calling in I love your
question and I'm excited to answer it so
you have to find your customers by
driving around because they need to be
small business customers that also own
their building that also have high
utility bills I think there's some ways
around having to drive around for them I
would start with rom.com re ny.com it's
very expensive 450 bucks but they have a
7day free trial and you can do
everything you need to do within those
seven days because I don't want you to
spend 450 bucks just like I don't want
to spend it I have a virtual assistant
that I use from time to time his name is
atique attiq if you email me Chris coof
founders.com I'll make an introduction
he can scrape rom.com Romy is great
because it is the best commercial real
estate database that I have found I use
it for finding RV and mobile home parks
this is not sponsored they don't know
who I am but it's a great piece of
software so what you do is you'll go

[02:00]
software so what you do is you'll go
into Romy on your free trial you will
set a search for whatever you're looking
for and then you would save the search
by the filters that you set and then you
let atique log into your account he'll
go to your saved search and he will
scrape all of your results because Romy
charges you an insane amount for
exporting the results in addition to the
450 bucks a month that they charge you
it's just crazy then what I would do is
I would start with a very small radius
like a neighborhood and Whittle it down
you want to find building owners that
have a name or a business name that
matches the name of the business in that
building that will prevent you from
having to drive around it's not super
efficient but it's more efficient than
driving around and you can find another
virtual assistant to help you with that
so for instance if you see a building in
your exported spreadsheet that says
Bob's Plumbing LLC and then you see on
another database like outs scraper I
guess that's the second part of the step
is go to outs scraper run a scrape
yourself for the same GE graphy and then

[03:01]
yourself for the same GE graphy and then
put them side by side you can use a
vlookup or an xlookup Ask chat GPT how
to do that and then you can match all of
the lines or all of the rows in the
spreadsheets by address and then just
try to find LLC names or business names
or owner names that match the name of
the owner of the business because when
you scrape on outs scraper if you check
the box to get owner names you'll also
get owner names so that's it Romy scrape
plus out scrape for scrape will tell you
which buildings are owned by the
business owner in that building and then
you'll also know by default that they're
small businesses and you'll be able to
Market to them you'll have their name
their phone number their email address
their physical address and you'll be
good to go and then you can use my
scraping guide which is in my toolkit if
you subscribe to my newsletter TKO
pod.com you'll get the scraping guide in
the welcome email after subscribing
you'll get my copyrighting guide my cold
emailing guide everything you'll get all
my my growth hacks in that welcome email
so hope that helps and also this advice
applies to anyone trying to scrape uh
real estate bionomy is a great solution

[04:01]
real estate bionomy is a great solution
for this let's go to the next question
hey Chris I love making Google
spreadsheets I'm kind of nerd that way
but I would love to start selling them I
do have an Etsy shop and I just
partnered with somebody who will manage
it and will do all the SEO and and drive
more sales there but where I really want
to see myself going is working with
small to mediumsized businesses who
don't have traditional crms or anything
who maybe already have spread sheets and
I I can jump in and enhance them or
create different spread sheets such as
CRM sales tracking that type of stuff so
main question is what do you think about
this idea do you hate it I would love to
make about $5,000 on the side there but
I know that I need a a couple more
clients I need a lot of clients doing
that once I do get a lot of clients I'm
more than happy to to start hiring with
Fiverr upwork and and kind of be the
manager of those relationships but I
also need to get more businesses so
wondering if what your thoughts are
about this how can I differentiate
myself from my competitors from other
people who are doing this how can I get
a lot more clients my main goal of this
as well is to do something while my kids

[05:01]
as well is to do something while my kids
are sleeping while it's a little bit
slower at my day job yeah so just
definitely want to make about $5,000 a
quarter doing this and I think that
would be a game changer for me so
anyways let me know your thoughts thanks
all right great question I don't know
what your name is but your email has the
word KIRO in it Q so I'm going to call
you that love this idea I love the
practice of brainstorming ways of
selling spreadsheets because that's not
something I've ever done and it kind of
makes my brain tickle or hurt a little
bit depending on how you look at it so
as you asking me this question I went to
Etsy and I typed in spreadsheet and
there is a little growth act you can use
on Etsy which I love I didn't know
frankly that spreadsheets were sold on
it Etsy I knew that digital products
were sold here but not spreadsheets but
it makes sense looks like there's a lot
of people doing it which is good for you
after typing in spreadsheet I just kind
of looked around and I looked at the
seller names because I want to find
sellers that are primarily Andor
exclusively selling spreadsheets and I
found a guy called the sheet code one
word on Etsy the sheet code and I click

[06:00]
word on Etsy the sheet code and I click
on his profile if you're watching on
YouTube I'm going to share my screen so
you'll be able to watch this okay so the
sheet code is selling a family and
coup's financial planner package for
$8.23 and I just love this 24 people
bought this in the last 24 hours so this
guy's made 200 bucks today which is
670 Grand a year from one of his
products just crazy his entire store has
1257 reviews this one product has 191
almost all festar reviews but here's
what you can do if you want to know what
type of spreadsheets people are buying
on Etsy if you're watching on YouTube
look at my screen you want to find out
how many products they're selling and
then find out the ratio of number of
reviews on that one product to number of
their total reviews so this guy has 191
reviews on this product and he has 1257
reviews total so this about 15% call it
15% of all of his reviews are for this

[07:02]
15% of all of his reviews are for this
one product 100 divided by 15 is about
seven give or take so all else equal he
should have about seven products if they
all sold about the same but of course
they won't so let's see how many
products this guy has okay he's made
17,000 sales 31 items okay so surely
anyone listening to this is familiar
with the 820 rule but I'm just going to
repeat it in case one of you isn't I
love the 8020 rule because it appears
everywhere it's like a law of the
universe it just appears everywhere 80%
of your sales come from 20% of your
people 80% of your headaches come from
20% of your customers 80% of your
productivity comes from 20% of your
employees it's everywhere and so it
clearly looks like this personal finance
budgeting spreadsheet is one of this
guy's top sellers because he has 31
items for sale he probably only sells a
few of these other ones every day or
every week and he sells a ton of the
other ones so if I sort by highest price

[08:00]
other ones so if I sort by highest price
they're all priced at
8.82 to like $189 very cheap but they're
all basically personal finance packages
so what you could do is you could use a
software tool to scrape these or you
could just do it manually real quick put
all 31 in a spreadsheet and then write
down how many reviews he has for each of
the 31 and then you're going to know
what his best sellers are and then if I
were you I would buy some of his best
sellers and look at it and read the
reviews and see what if there are any
four or lower star reviews what are they
complaining about what could be improved
upon these and then you use the words
and the reviews to write your copy on
your product so if people are saying
like this is great five stars all around
but I really wish that I could toggle
and adjust for inflation because of all
the inflation we've had lately I really
wish I could account for it in a little
toggle cell okay so now that's just one
data point but it could could be
representative of others that aren't

[09:01]
representative of others that aren't
saying it so then you could not just put
that in your spreadsheet but you could
advertise that in your spreadsheets but
from a broader perspective just read
every single review and find
commonalities what do they love about it
because a lot of times this guy this
bestseller it says family and couple
annual budget Google Sheets Excel he's
just keyword stuffing okay which is fine
it clearly works he ranks highly but it
doesn't really answer people's questions
so if people in the reviews are
constantly saying I love that it adjust
for inflation I love that adjusts for
inflation I love that it adjusts for
inflation but he's not even selling that
then you could just have a very similar
spreadsheet that does the same things
and you could just sell that more in the
title or in the description so spend
hours on Etsy looking at other
spreadsheets what's selling really well
what isn't and then break my advice my
advice is always to fish where people
are fishing sell this stuff where other
people are selling it but also do the
opposite sometimes I bet you very few
people are selling spreadsheets on

[10:00]
people are selling spreadsheets on
Facebook Marketplace because they're not
thinking to but there's probably traffic
for it you could do some keyword
stuffing yourself and see how many
search results you pop up in so Facebook
groups local Facebook groups even if
it's not a local city that you're in but
if you want to sell these to small
businesses as you say I would go to a
local Facebook group and just ask for a
small business owner if you could make
some free spreadsheets for them just to
see if you can add value and then either
you can resell that same spreadsheet to
other small small business owners in the
same Niche or you can say hey in the
process of making this sheet for
tracking all your dental patients I
learned that you probably need another
sheet for tracking your receptionist
hours would you mind if I make one of
those for you be 30 bucks or something
like that that will just open your eyes
to all kinds of other needs that the
business owner might have but you should
start by doing it for free at least so
you could learn some feedback on what
they like or dislike about your
spreadsheets also play around with Etsy
ads some of these guys might just be
crushed it in organic rankings but if

[11:00]
crushed it in organic rankings but if
you put some paid ads behind your
spreadsheets with a $0 cost to fulfill
it could be pretty lucrative also I
would do the same reverse engineering on
gumroad which as you probably know is
like an Etsy but primarily for digital
products only so great question all
right Josh has a question about closing
sales over the phone hey Chris this is
Josh from Ohio I was just reading your
article about your iPhone screen repair
business and wanted to ask you about
closing your deals you mentioned that
you'd hop on the phone with some of your
bigger clients to make sure to close the
deals compared to having your vas do it
all I have a little experience with this
with the EMD lending business and doing
cold and warm Outreach like Alex rosi
always talks about but specifically when
you get on the phone to close a deal
what are some of the strategies some of
the tips that have worked really well
for you and you use as a framework going
forward throughout other businesses I'd
really love to hear what you think and
what you have to say and and look
forward to hearing your answer soon love

[12:02]
forward to hearing your answer soon love
your content and thanks so much for
listening to this thanks for the
question Josh love the question and I'm
just going to take two of the words that
you said and point it right back at you
Alex horoi Alex brosi he's the sales
King I cannot even hold a candle to his
sales ability so I'm going to repeat a
lot of what he repeats because I've
taken his advice to heart and it's made
me a better salesman the most important
thing you can do when closing any deal
over the phone or in person is to have a
no brainer Grand Slam offer because
no-brainer offer will cover a multitude
of sins if you're not very bold you're
not very pressuring you're not very
extroverted you're not great with people
all of that can be covered by a
no-brainer Grand Slam offer and really
anything above a no-brainer offer often
gets a little slimy often turns into
just kind of strong arming someone or
kind of twisting them into buying your
product or service and you start to
flirt in the gray area which doesn't
make me feel super comfortable but if

[13:01]
make me feel super comfortable but if
you can have an amazing offer that
conveys really well to them then you
will close more deals so in the earnest
money deposit lending industry which I
don't know much about to be honest I
would get on 10 sales calls with 10 of
your competitors if you're a competitor
and take a ton of notes on what they're
doing well or not well on the phone and
you are going to learn so much from them
you really just have to be bold on
getting to the heart of what their
objections are because usually the
objections that were given are not the
true objections like H I just need to
think about it that usually means it's
too expensive I just think it's too
expensive that usually means there's not
enough value there in what you're
offering or at least you're not
conveying the value well enough so you
need to put together an offer that feels
risk-free to them it makes them feel
stupid for saying no like literally they
would feel dumb for saying no to your
offer now that varies from industry to
Industry obviously it's harder in some
Industries to make that no-brainer offer
than others but it's always going to be
possible so if you haven't read $100

[14:01]
possible so if you haven't read $100
million offers I would go read that if
you have read it I would go read it
again because there's a lot to learn in
there all right let's hear what Doug has
to say good morning Chris my wife and I
are racking our brains trying to come up
with a side hustle we are going to pull
off and start something but we're just
not sure what just yet we are scouring
your ideas and also thinking about
either a service industry or a Shopify
store and product what is the first step
in order to pull the trigger and get
started form an LLC question mark Doug
thanks for the question it's funny
because you basically got down to two
different industries that you're
considering e-commerce and service and I
have a lot more experience in e-commerce
than I have in service businesses so
maybe this answer is too biased because
I'm jaded but if you're choosing between
those two I would not choose e-commerce
e-commerce is hard it is capital
intensive it takes a while to hit cash
flow positivity it's generally low

[15:01]
flow positivity it's generally low
margin It generally has to be driven by
paid ads which generally means you have
to be really good at paid ads or pay an
agency way too much to do paid ads for
you in which you'll get a mixed bag of
results so all else equal I would
definitely start a service business do
not worry about getting an LLC I
answered this on a recent episode a
couple weeks ago about when do you get
the LLC you get the LLC when you're
generating revenue and you're sure that
it's going to be a thing this is going
to be something that you're going to
file taxes on it's here to stay don't
get an LLC first you need to find a
customer first whatever your service
business is even if it's an unpay
customer even if the customer is your
mom you need to get a customer start
with a friends and family customer and
or an unpay customer and then upgrade to
a customer that pays you less than what
your cost is to fulfill just so you can
get your reps and get some testimonials
and then just keep increasing your
prices and go from there but you got to
start testing things like we could
research or learn business ideas until

[16:01]
research or learn business ideas until
the cows come home but we're not even
going to know if it's a good idea until
we start to try it you just don't know
it's all Theory all right David has a
question about mattress stores all right
if you are watching this clip right now
you are watching this on YouTube and if
you are a fan of podcast please check
out my podcast while you're at it
because sometimes I have podcasts that
aren't on YouTube and sometimes I have
YouTubes that aren't on podcast so check
out the ker office on any podcast
platform or you can go to TKO pod.com
also my newsletter will throw that in
there there are no ads It's weekly it's
different content than my podcast and
YouTube newsletter. chrisj cerner.com
You'll see the link and we'll see you
there what do you think about lowcost
mattress stores I just love it this is
the shortest question that's ever been
asked me what do you think about lowcost
mattress stores very straightforward to
the point and honestly I probably would
have ignored this question had I not
been talking to a mattress guy here over
the last week or two he is on Twitter I
think he's known as the mattress guy or
something like that and we've been
emailing and I'm just curious about his
business and what this guy does is he

[17:00]
business and what this guy does is he
sells high-end mattresses on Twitter and
he's making 20 to 30 grand a month
part-time doing this and this is the
last email that he sent me I said his
name is Nick Hancock direct Outlet
Charlotte is his business if you want to
look him up I have no affiliation just a
guy been emailing nice guy so I said
Nick can you send me some numbers uh the
margin you make on mattresses quantity
you sell per month crazy stories how the
logistics work because as part of this
podcast I'm always doing research on
cool business ideas that's what I do so
this was just something that I haven't
even posted about yet you heard it here
first he said sure thing 50% gross
profit minimum typically around 55 to
60% average ticket is 1 to 3K so we'll
stop right there let's say $2,000
average mattress he is going to gross
about
$1,200 on that mattress 30% net after
everything so $600 net on average per
mattress saving people thousands as they
are just getting quoted $6 to $10,000 at
mattr mattress retailers 20 to 30 a

[18:01]
mattr mattress retailers 20 to 30 a
month and growing with Twitter Logistics
are simple if in Charlotte I deliver
same day if out of state FedEx or LTL
LTL means less than truckload AKA not a
full truckload and typically they in 3
to 5 days so then I asked how do you
Source these if someone wanted to make
money at this how much of that would you
be willing to share it's a fine balance
because that's what people want to read
he said multiple manufacturers here in
the states I won't be giving these
contacts away my dad built these over 35
years of doing business but those people
are all at the furniture markets in Las
Vegas and high point I can easily share
how I would start from scratch today
with my knowledge no problem so thanks
for the question it looks like I
searched mattress in my email looks like
you emailed me this morning at 7:38 in
the morning so hopefully this answer
suffices but zooming out a little bit I
love the concept of selling High ticket
items just as a greasy money grubbing
middleman there's nothing wrong with
being a middleman especially if you
don't have to hold inventory
and you're really just acting as a

[19:00]
and you're really just acting as a
broker and making 600 bucks a pop so as
far as lowcost mattress stores I don't
know it's it's going to be a little more
complex you're going to have to sign a
long-term lease you're going to have to
hold inventory you might go a day or two
or three without any sales because
that's just the name of the game in the
mattress business but I do know that
you'll want to post up next to other
mattress stores because that's just what
you do you you want to go where people
are mattress shopping and if you're
right next to a mattress Plus or a
mattress firm or whatever they're called
you're probably going to do really well
all right let's hear from Spencer Hey
Chris first and foremost really love
your content and just everything you're
about all the business ideas I'm the
exact same way I've always just looking
and seeing every business around me how
can I expand it how can I capitalize on
an opportunity see all those things so
really love it thank you quick question
for you I exited my business which was
an online licensing business I exited it
in the beginning of 2023 I do have
another business that currently runs
that I'm not really involved in the day

[20:00]
that I'm not really involved in the day
day-to-day of and so I not kind of work
on it here and there but my big question
has been I've really struggled over the
last year and a half going on two years
now since I sold my business of really
kind of going all in and and having the
motivation to start uh new business and
really scale it up you know it's one of
those things where I don't have kids
happily married and with the exit I got
enough money to really kind of live
comfortably I've never really wanted for
a lot right not big into just buying
stuff for the sake of find stuff and so
I guess my question for you is where do
you get that motivation to continue
going essentially when money no longer
becomes the main driver of doing the
business and kind of where do you get
that motivation to continue with these
business ideas once you start hitting
those friction points where it gets hard
where it's not as fun anymore thanks so
much and appreciate everything you're
doing thank you Spencer I see your
question as being two parts first part
is how do you find motivation to start a
business when you're well off already
you don't need the money second part of
the question is if you do start a

[21:01]
the question is if you do start a
business how do you push through when
things get hard if you don't need the
money so I've been in your shoes before
it was not a great time in my life
honestly I wasn't super productive I
wasn't super hungry I would start
businesses and then just quit them as
soon as things got hard because I didn't
have to keep going and the best and
biggest businesses I've ever started
have been when I had no plan B I had no
parachute I I had to make it work and
that's usually the case we're forced to
make it work but there is something you
can do first of all you need to change
your scenery you need to travel more you
need to get out see what types of
businesses are going on in other states
or other countries also you need to join
some communities some meetups you need
to meet up with new people entrepreneurs
maybe that are younger than you maybe
that are hungrier than you or doing cool
things that might not have your
expertise and just get in the game more
it just sounds like you're not in the
game as much and when I say in the game
I don't mean just like learning about
business ideas like listening to my
content but like actually out there
exploring diing into ideas another thing

[22:00]
exploring diing into ideas another thing
I would suggest is to fall in love with
a hobby and really just dive deep into a
hobby something that you never plan to
monetize for me that would be cooking
authentic pizza in my outdoor pizza oven
or turning wood bowls with my lathe and
then as you become engrossed in that
task you're going to start to see
opportunities that you're really really
passionate about that you really don't
care if it ever makes money because if
you love business like it sounds like
you do then you'll love your hobby even
even more now it is a thing when people
try to monetize their Hobbies it doesn't
become fun to them anymore but that
doesn't always happen it doesn't happen
with me now how to persist if you do
start a business and things get hard and
you don't really have the motivation you
need an accountability partner you need
to get a business partner maybe he's an
operator maybe you're Co-operators but
you should get a business partner or a
friend or someone that's in your local
area that you do business with in person
that will help you have a lot more fun
and stay motivated and have those late
night whiteboard sessions where you both

[23:00]
night whiteboard sessions where you both
super excited that's the fun part of
business and you will feel indebted to
your business partner to not just give
it up because you're partnered with
someone and they're holding you
accountable and also to be a little more
meta here just don't worry about it man
like you're going to figure it out like
you're going to come across the thing
that excites you and you're going to
persist it'll come eventually it's been
two years now which isn't that much time
in the grand scheme of things so just
keep staying in the game be in the game
more like I said go meet people all
right we got CG up next friend of the
Pod Connor gross he's been on a bunch of
times he's going to be on again and I
was delighted and surprised to see that
he left me a question so let's listen to
what Connor has to say hey it's Connor I
remember you and I having a conversation
a while ago and I was trying to approach
it from the philosophy of every business
that I start I want to hold forever and
that was something that I was trying to
work on because I thought that it would
be easier just to start and hold
companies indefinitely and you basically
told me your whole business philosophy
is you don't care if you buy things sell

[24:01]
is you don't care if you buy things sell
things start them make a couple hundred
thousand and then they fizzle out like
whatever it looks like you just enjoy
the process and I feel like that would
be a really interesting subject to talk
about which is your focus on how you
start companies how you think about
holding Brands incubating Brands when
you want to sell if you want to have a
liquidity event every year if you want
to have it every 5 years if you don't
even think about that stuff at all cuz
you're just too focused on growing
things like at some point I've realized
this for myself too having six things
all under a million dollars a year kind
of sucks and it gets very stressful but
you seem to enjoy the smaller things and
either holding some and scaling them up
or you know treating them
opportunistically so talking about that
I think would be a really interesting
subject Connor great question and you're
right having six things under a million
dollars in Revenue sucks it can for sure
it also depends on how much involvement
you have in those six things I don't

[25:01]
you have in those six things I don't
have much involvement in in most of them
but I had this thought recently where
it's like what what is the opposite of a
detail oriented person or a details guy
whatever that is it's me I don't notice
things that other people notice I'm not
a planner at all I'm the opposite of a
planner I'm impulsive I'm off the cuff
and that results in 75 businesses
started so here's one thing I I do do no
matter what I start I really want want
to nail the bookkeeping on day one and
you know what there's another question
in here about bookkeeping so I'll get to
that one next but I want to start
tracking my finances in a Google sheet
from day one because you should read the
book built to sell anyone listening to
this should read the book built to sell
anything you start you should build it
to sell from day one because it's just
best practices whether you sell it or
not you'll keep things cleaner this is
going to sound a little woo woo but
starting businesses is Art to me anyway
it's art and I don't know what it's like
to be an actual artist like a painter or

[26:01]
to be an actual artist like a painter or
something but I would imagine they just
start painting and they just kind of see
where it takes them and when they start
they're not like all right this is going
to be it's going to look like this when
I'm done I'm going to sell it for this
much I'm going to hang it on this wall
this type of person's going to buy it
it's going to be hung in this Gallery
like they just have some sort of bug in
their brain that's telling them to paint
to get it out get that thing out of
their head and so they they just start
getting it out and they don't go buy and
LC they don't go open a spreadsheet they
don't start calling art galleries before
they even start painting they're just
making art and that's probably a good
reason why starving artist is a phrase
that most artists do not do well
whatsoever because if they were more
calculated about it then they might be
able to employ some common business
tactics and sell their art for more
money but for me I look at it as art I
get an idea and I got to get it out get
it out of my head and most of those will
turn into nothing some of those will
turn into businesses some of them big
some small some will fail spectacularly

[27:02]
some small some will fail spectacularly
I just don't know and so I watch Shark
Tank sometimes or I used to and people
like this is my baby I can't give away
30% of my business for a million dollars
like what that's nothing that's my this
is my baby I can't I've never had a
business that's my baby because every
business is just another business and
they're not people they're not living
entities it's a painting that's it and
so with that being said I'd sell any
business I'd keep any business I'd shut
down any business it just depends on the
situation and on what the opportunity
cost is if I own a business that's
taking almost no time and it's just kind
of languishing I won't even spend the
time to get rid of it or to shut it down
or to sell it because it's just out of
sight out of mind for better or worse if
I own a business that's not doing well
and I'm spending too much time on it
then I will actively work to divest of
it in some way or another but how it's
worked for me in the past is the more
businesses I take on the more ideas that
I start the sooner I find the ones that
have product Market fit that are keeping

[28:01]
have product Market fit that are keeping
me up all night that are just crushing
it the ones that I'm going to Home Depot
and buying a bunch of wheelbarrows so I
can just carry all this cash to the bank
those are the ones that my time and
attention and investment naturally
gravitate towards and those ones I'm not
passionate about so I wish I had a sexy
framework I could put in a in a YouTube
short 60 seconds how I look at this or
how I think of this but it's just a way
for me to be creative and it's a lot of
fun all right let's do one more about
bookkeeping Austin hey Chris this is
Austin really love the Pod and
everything else you guys bring to the
table here with business ideas Etc
actually working on something myself
based on something I heard on your pod
and uh I just had a quick question even
actually as I am a CPA myself mainly
actually see myself as more as an
entrepreneur and operator and as I start
my first company what's your advice on
doing the bookkeeping and accounting and
how you ever really get that started

[29:00]
how you ever really get that started
with your companies right off the back
do you have any tools or or you know
obviously QuickBooks and stuff is small
but if something was going to scale
quickly what would you really start with
how do you get this going and I feel
like not enough people on podcast talk
about this because that is a crucial
part to the business and a fundamental
piece to every business is the
accounting if you don't have that right
then I don't think you can really end up
with a really good exit or anything of
the like so really would love for you to
touch on this thank you great question
Austin I don't talk about bookkeeping
that much frankly because I'm terrible
at it and I hate it and it's the bane of
my existence but it's a great question
and I'm happy to answer it I look at
bookkeeping as having three thresholds
number one Google Sheets number two
QuickBooks number three bigger than
QuickBooks and honestly I've never
gotten to number three before because
QuickBooks can handle businesses of over
$100 million okay number one Google
Sheets very simple
revenues expenses you can export your

[30:00]
revenues expenses you can export your
bank account I suggest Mercury and or
Bank of America preferably Mercury we
like Bank of America because they
integrate with zel and we need zel for
some of our subcontractors and Mercury
does not but this is how I look at it
personal checking account to start to
validate the business okay once I see
I've got revenue this is going to be a
thing I do two things I go file an LLC
and get an EIN number AKA tax ID number
and then I will use those documents to
go get a business bank account
preferably with Mercury and then I will
take the ghou sheet that I use to track
all the expenses in my personal bank
account and I will true it all up I will
get everything in the business bank
account and then I will run everything
through that business bank account from
that point on very strict even if like I
have a business that's putting 30 grand
a month on Facebook ads and it's really
tempting to get a a credit card to get
2% cash back or AMX points or something
I don't mess with that I used to but
it's just like honestly if I had one
business and I knew I was only going to
have one I probably would do that I
would get a Capital One or a venture

[31:00]
would get a Capital One or a venture
card or something to get points but when
I have a you know a half dozen
businesses I don't want a half dozen
credit cards a half dozen debit cards a
half dozen bank accounts half dozen
venmo accounts PayPal it is an absolute
nightmare so I'll put everything in that
mercury account on the debit card and
then I will keep tracking everything in
that same Google sheet my debits and my
credits and then the second threshold is
when I'll find a bookkeeper I used to
set up QuickBooks myself manage it
myself but it's not a good use of my or
your your time so it's not hard to use
anyone can use QuickBooks it's just not
a good use of your time even if you like
it don't do it right you're better off
marketing or selling your product or
service so get a bookkeeper you can find
thousands of bookkeepers for low
hundreds of dollars a month it's money
well spent they'll get in QuickBooks for
you they'll do all the hairy stuff
they'll maintain it you just want a
panal and a a balance sheet every month
that's it panal and balance sheet every
month and every year of course and maybe
quarterly if you're into that kind of
thing but LLC always but don't forget

[32:01]
thing but LLC always but don't forget
LLC is a pass through entity which means
you are taxed on the profit of your
business you are not taxed on what you
pull out of your business so if you make
a million dollars of net profit in your
business but you're using most of that
for growth or for ads or for inventory
and you only take home
$200,000 guess what your tax bill is
going to be almost twice what you took
out and put in your personal checking
account so prepare for that a lot of
people are surprised by that and you
have to make quarterly estimated taxes
tax payments and that's a pain and I
hate everything about taxes and
bookkeeping in the IRS and I have been
audited and it was the worst period of
my life I wouldn't wish it on my worst
enemy but don't overthink it Google
sheet one dedicated business bank
account once you're sure this is going
to be a thing and then find a bookkeeper
don't pay him any more than a few
hundred bucks a month maybe 500 Max
depending on how complex it is we have a
crypto business with all kinds of
different accounts and crypto
transactions that's a lot more complex
but if everything everything's coming
through a bank account very little cash

[33:00]
through a bank account very little cash
you shouldn't need to pay that much you
can find a virtual assistant that's
really really good to do it for you as
well get everything categorized in
QuickBooks and then everything will
automatically fall into their buckets
all right that's it for today's Q&A come
