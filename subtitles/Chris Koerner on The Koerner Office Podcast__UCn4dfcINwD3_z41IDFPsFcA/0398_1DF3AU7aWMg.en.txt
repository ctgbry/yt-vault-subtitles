[00:00]
my name is Chris Kerner thank you for
joining um I have been investing in real
estate since I was a freshman in college
in tuscalo Alabama buying single family
rentals I moved to Dallas 2014 started
buying small RV parks in Oklahoma with a
couple friends and we started buying
mobile home parks we did that for two
years um we sold the portfolio in 2021
I'd love to tell you that it was
brilliant timing and we planned it just
like that but it was just luck um so
after sold the portfolio I started
writing about Mobile Home Park investing
online um did that for a year and a half
or so and that led me to meet John and
blue metric and Jeff and some of my
other cgps that happened a year ago uh
blue metric had been around for about a
year so it's been about two years now
for blue metric and one year for me in
blue metric and we did our first deal in
Southern Louisiana together kind of on a
handshake just said see how this goes
and it went great and we' been doing

[01:00]
and it went great and we' been doing
deals together ever since did I miss
anything
John well that was
great sh you want me to you want me to
go ahead now that'd be great and yeah so
John John cascarano I'm a h Rec largely
recovered commercial real estate
attorney and been a part of a few
companies um going back to went to Duke
undergrad and was part of a company
there that was later acquired then went
to law school in Michigan and um went
and practiced at a big Law Firm for a
while and uh left started a company sold
the company went back to law and was
really trying to figure what I was going
to do next and I had a client buying
mobile home parks and basically they got
an RV park under contract and I kept I
was asking to invest I was wanting
probably like a lot of folks wanting to
you know build passive income and and
you know invest um outside of me as a
lawyer doing billable hours and um he
got an RB Park under contract and said
hey you've been asking to invest take a
look at this and I looked at it and I

[02:01]
look at this and I looked at it and I
you know drove out there and vetted it
and did all the things and all the
diligence and and I liked it and we
bought it and it we still own it and it
went went great it's going great and
pretty quickly after that just started
seeing lots of opportunity in the RV
sector you know I followed the same path
where you know after that bought another
had a partner bought some raised Capital
to buy some and then I started thinking
that there's something more at play in
this sector like I think building a
being an entrepreneur you building a
brand
streamlining the management um I saw a
sector kind of ripe for consolidation
and then that you know Flash Forward
here we are 26 Parks uh 10 states and um
um living living and breathing RV parks
never never would have thought of but
that's that's that's what I'm doing so
and enjoying it all right thank you John
so there's GNA be call it four sections
to this we're going to start by talking
about the park in Northwest Arkansas um
that is under contract we won't close it
until uh next quarter first quarter of

[03:01]
until uh next quarter first quarter of
next year um we're going to talk about a
fund that we have that has a piece of
every Park um and then we are going to
talk about the bonus depreciation
dropping in about four weeks and then at
the end we will do Q&A where if you
could type your questions in the chat
we'll get around to it so I'm G to share
my screen and get started
here so this is our portfolio
and as John said 10 states 26 Parks um
we our common theme is we like to be
near a destination of some sort call it
a state park or a national park um a
water
feature it's our parks are not uh
exclusive long-term only Parks um
they're not exclusive short-term only
Parks most are hybrid of both with an
emphasis on short-term stays Travelers
staying two to four days um we like this

[04:00]
staying two to four days um we like this
thesis because it's a hedge uh against
the economy when the economy is strong
as we see right now we see a higher
percentage of short-term stays which are
more profitable to the tune of call it
$60 to 90 a night per pad site whereas
whenif the economy sour um the RV parks
become more of a long-term destination
where people live month-to month or year
to year to the tune of call it 600 to
1100 per month so um the intent is to be
amenity Rich to be on that end of the
barbell if we have a park manager we
might as well add all the amenities we
can um so we can keep our occupancy high
and keep our rates at Market um we don't
like being in the messy Middle where
you've got a pool a part-time park
manager we like being on that end of the
barbell um that's our thesis um these
are our Parks we're most highly
concentrated in Kentucky but we prefer
Tennessee and any state that touches
Tennessee um and we our first Park in

[05:00]
Tennessee um and we our first Park in
Montana about six months ago right
outside the Glacier National Park
entrance it's gone amazingly well and
and we recently bought a second Park
about an hour and a half away that's
gone well as well so in the Southeast
plus Montana um about a few months ago
we rebranded because blue metric was
always meant to be an investor facing
brand and we we want to be like more
like KOA we want a brand that is more
consumer facing where you could have a
membership or a loyalty card and you can
hop around from park to park and we can
enjoy more economies of scale there so
we just launched this Streamside brand
over the summer um which really is just
a consumer facing brand to more better
operationalize and professionalize what
we're doing so I'm going to let a couple
people in and then I'm going to go over
to the Rivers's Edge um RV Park in
Springdale Arkansas so let's start start

[06:00]
Springdale Arkansas so let's start start
with a map I love Maps um and if you see
me just pause on the screen it's because
I'm letting someone in super convenient
so this is where it is uh many of you
probably already know that Northwest
Arkansas is one of the fastest growing
parts of the country is the mountain
biking capital of the world um home to
Walmart of course um home to the
University of Arkansas Walmart
headquarters is about 40 minutes away
right there the airport is right there
on my left about 40 minutes away the
university is just south in fville about
30 minutes away and this is just a great
park because you enjoy the short-term
stays um because we're right here on the
river there's a lot to do here like I
said mountain bike and capital of the
world a lot of camping um the Ozarks
aren't far away so you enjoy the
short-term stays but this area is so
booming how housing is becoming more and
more unaffordable uh so we have quite
high percentage of of long-term stays

[07:02]
high percentage of of long-term stays
John do you know off the top of your
head roughly what what percent of our
tenants are are month-to-month versus
nightly yeah it's it's 83% right now is
is monthly tenants and the rest are
reserved for nightly okay so I I look at
that as incredible because it's we we
we're buying the park at a 99.7% cap
rate which cap rate is the purchase
price of the park divided by um the net
operating income and so so if we're at
83% at a 99.7% cap rate it means the
opportunity to pull a lever and to
increase our Revenue even more by
marketing more to short-term Travelers
is very high so um all right so that's
where it is I'm going to zoom in and
show a Google Earth image and then I'm
going to hop over to the
deck all right
so you've got a single family
neighborhood bordering it um you're

[08:01]
neighborhood bordering it um you're
right off the highway um it's on 50
acres this is the room that we have to
expand into and it's 145 pad sites uh
today um I will get into the amenities
right over
here so this just kind of shows our
operating
structure um this shows the you know the
the size of our portfolio 243 pad sites
um 25 Parks now about to be 26 430 LPS
$60 million invested um those are all of
our Parks those are the states that we
operate
in um this kind of goes over what I was
just talking about why we like RV parks
so much um it is recession resistant for
those reasons it's a hedge against the
economy um we don't buy parks in areas
that are very loose with zoning laws we
don't have any park par in Texas uh

[09:01]
don't have any park par in Texas uh
primarily for that reason um we like
parks that are protected from a
competitor opening up opening up right
next door right down the road a year or
two later um we have not seen much
consolidation in the space Believe It or
Not marinas are being Consolidated more
than ourv Parks um music schools are
being Consolidated and rolled up more
than ourv Parks um but we're starting to
see it happen uh I know that we've had
people reach out to us
since our our value crossed into the the
nine figures range um we think it's
inevitable and the entire play here is
to compress the cap rate achieve
economies of scale you know dominate a
region uh and hopefully uh exit to to
private Equity at a compressed cap rate
wherein every LP uh would benefit from
being a member of the whole entity so um
this is what most of our deals look like
eight to 10% preferred return uh

[10:02]
eight to 10% preferred return uh
depending on the park depending on the
asset class which means that the first
8% in this case goes directly to LPS the
investors um most of our targeted uh
internal rate of return percentages are
in the 25% range sometimes lower if it's
a more um sophisticated Park a more
wellestablished Park like it was in
Montana um sometimes higher if it's a
higher risk park with a little more
upside or a little more rural
um bonus depreciation as we've talked
about which we'll talk about more later
um today sits at about
60% uh and that goes to uh investors
first of course it depends on the park
it depends on what our cost segregation
studies show but it usually shakes out
around
60%
um it kind of talks about what I've
already said um this just shows that
we're bullish on the overall industry as
a whole people are going outside more

[11:00]
a whole people are going outside more
the pendulum is swinging away from being
on screens all day we've got that Trend
we've got the retiring Baby Boomers
Trend traveling a lot we've got the
instagrammable experiences Trend
benefiting us Millennials wanting to
travel more um people living digital
Nomad lives wanting to travel more um
State and national parks are seeing
record attendance year-over-year and
we're trying to raate ride um all of
those waves so more information about
the space I won't I'm not going to read
to you what you can read yourself but
we're very very bullish on this Spas
so um all
right this is a $5.6 million raise it's
a $10 million Park the 2024 net
operating income is
950,000 in change um hence the 99.7% cap
rate on a $10 million purchase price uh
we're targeting a 2.32
return of capital within 3 to 5 years

[12:02]
return of capital within 3 to 5 years
26.8% irr uh and as John said 83% of
tenants or long-term tenants uh our
seller financing terms are awesome um we
are seller financing 6.5 million uh at
four and a half percent 36 months
interest only uh the reason for the
raise being where it is is because we're
also raising for capex we're raising to
expand uh the pad sites by 50 units I
believe so
we don't like Capital calls we don't
like having to raise again for the same
park correct me if I'm wrong John but I
don't believe we've ever had to do that
um we like raising enough plenty more
than we need um and then returning what
we don't end up
using that's the expansion area as I
said were you gonna say something John
no just that yeah you could see you know
that empty
area you know kind of already planned

[13:00]
area you know kind of already planned
out for expansion and there's you know
some of these sites there there's room
to improve the amenities and room to add
some more premium sites and you know you
get you get the the Hogs the Arkansas
Razer backs games and you know those
those game day there's always always
parking needed so there's there's
definitely room you know with 50 acres
to to you know infill this park and get
more juice out of it yeah I mean
anecdotally I was at the Alabama Iron
Bowl game last weekend and we stayed in
a hotel an hour and a half away and
there were just RVs everywhere um from
the game an hour and a half away in a
different state entirely so similar for
the Michigan Ohio State game not to
touch on any touchy
subjects we did you go to that game um
we um no we were we were potentially
going to but it was a long story we went
to the Northwestern game the week before
but and um but didn't didn't get into
the Michigan Ohio State game
okay um this just another uh view of the

[14:03]
okay um this just another uh view of the
map showing the employers that are in
the area um more high level view of
where it is bville we won't go into all
that um high level financials um cash on
cash return uh year one
11.1% expense ratio today is about 40%
uh we plan to you know take a hit in the
beginning because we'll be throwing more
people people at it and then you know we
plan to get it down over time that we
see that usually with Parks uh year one
we kind of take a step or two back uh
while we operationalize it um oftentimes
we're buying these Parks from the owner
directly who manages it directly and we
have to replace them um with someone so
that's what we're seeing
there this is what your projected
returns would look like over the next 5
years if $100,000 were invested um
you'll see this big bump here on year

[15:01]
you'll see this big bump here on year
three let him in um that's from the
refinance the the goal for all of these
Parks is to refinance around year three
um we've received term sheets from Banks
to refinance um it just hasn't made
sense for us to do so so far we've been
doing this two years from day one the
goal has been to refinance parks at year
three uh we haven't had enough time aaps
to do that yet but the idea go ahead we
have one that's about to go through I
mean r we're seen rates
now below seven um rates have been kind
of weird but we just we just locked one
at below seven and um the two two the
two Prior Park purchases were both below
s% now so that's awesome that's great
yeah okay so yeah um the hope is to
return 80 to 120% of the capital around
year three at a refinance event after we
pull the expansion levers the rent
increase levers um and then at year five
an exit um we would exit the asset class

[16:02]
an exit um we would exit the asset class
hopefully um with everything else at a
compressed cap rate um and that's about
it for the Springdale um Arkansas Park
if anyone has any questions about this
park before we go into the fund uh I'm
happy to answer
that let's see all right so I'm going to
go to the questions we've got about six
here mobile home sector is right for
consolidation what percent do you think
has already been snatched up from baby
boomer owners who are wanting to exit
retire um so uh we've seen the mobile
home park sector being Consolidated for
a few years now I don't really look at
this as the same asset class
um there are three reats I believe um
for mobile home parks um but for RV
parks John are you seeing anything like
to me it's it even the mobile home park
industry is still extremely Consolidated
or sorry
extremely

[17:01]
extremely
unconsolidated yeah that's a good
question I don't want to throw out
number that's a good question on the
percentages I would I would agree
separate the two mobile home parks is
heavily Consolidated especially on big
bigger parks for sure yeah Sun
Communities Equity lifestyle properties
trust if you want exposure to those you
know they're they're publicly traded re
so you could you know you know buy a
little stock if you choose or you know
on the on the on the exchange but they
do own RV parks and marinas as part of
their
portfolios um as well so they often go
together but they haven't been I mean we
just see
endless endless Parks kind especially in
like that two to$ 20 million range in
the RV space like like like this I say
endless but lots and you know
inconsistent
branding I just that's I don't I don't
have a hard stat there that'd be that'd
be um that's a good question but all
right well well and we're buying um an

[18:02]
right well well and we're buying um an
asset class that is largely ignored um
Parks over $10 million are being
snatched up by private Equity Parks
under $2 million are being snatched up
by you know single family investors
multif family investors $2 to10 million
is kind of that messy middle from a
management perspective it's a like
having a park manager and a pool and
these amenities for a private investor
to wrap their arms around without having
scale is difficult and it's too small
for private equity but that's that's
where we're at it's it's the ma a lot of
it's the management that that drives
that the management of a mobile home
park is going to be more like an
apartment building so you'll you'll have
an easier time finding a manager but
because of the variety and different
kinds of RV parks that and mean that's
where early on that was the thing that
was really the the challenge to solve
like what is management at scale look
like there's a lot of mom and pop owned
Park so to speak where there it's your
business you're managing it yourself you

[19:00]
business you're managing it yourself you
know you could get a USDA loan and and
and have your own RV park but you know
how do you manage 10 or 20 or 30 and
that's that's where you know one of the
that was one of the first things to
solve yeah um so uh will we already
answered your question I I accidentally
answered it before I even read it so 100
any investment would be locked up for 3
to five years um unless there was an
early exit to private Equity that we we
can't foresee today is that right John
that's right yeah um bud how is the
river access and Associated River
activities for this
park yeah there's there's so you do have
to go over someone else's property um to
what extent we could do that we do have
portfolio insurance now which has opened
up ability for us to offer some of the
the things that were higher risk early
on like kayak Ren
uh you know ebike rentals that sort of

[20:01]
uh you know ebike rentals that sort of
thing um whether we could do that here I
think we'll be a conversation with the
Jan ading property owner so no no
guarantees we could we could open open
those up but um so do we have easement
access to the river John um I no we
don't right now no um people
there arguably we do but not not of of
record not officially yeah okay um NES
can you sh share more about Equity drops
to either 50 to 60% deal depending once
a 15% IR hurdle is
mat um it it wouldn't you
well your Equity oh that's the gplp
split so yeah once we you're e once we
achieve that rate of return there's a a
the GP percentage goes up so when we've
exceeded a certain irr hurdle
the there's a bonus to us as the the

[21:01]
the there's a bonus to us as the the
general partnership to beat that return
we get an increased percentage of equity
so it usually goes or in this case it
goes preferred return gets swiped off
the top then there's a an lpgp split in
LP's cash investors favor and then once
we beat that 15% I internal rate of
return hurdle um it usually like we
project it's usually after the the
refinance to be honest um you know
repaying the preferred return until then
and once there's some some event where a
chunk of of cash is returned um to you
all of us as cash investors then the
probably we've beaten that hurdle and we
get more of the of the future
distributions yep and then Usman asked
what are the bonus depreciation benefits
on investing in this deal so even if you
invest in this deal before the end of
the year we're not closing on the park
until after the end of the year and so
your bonus depreciation on a park like
this would be more in the 40% range than

[22:02]
this would be more in the 40% range than
in the 60% range which is the primary
reason why we're going to talk about the
fund next because the fund would enjoy
60% depreciation benefits which you can
only depreciate more passive income like
real estate related income as opposed to
W2 active
income yeah and there's all there's
there was a bill that would have taken
bonus depreciation back to 100% this
year and then it stalled and then we got
into the election stuff so so um you
know it's it's possible uh there's been
chatter but no um no bill yet but I'm
hoping that would be it would be great
for obviously for us and for this deal
if that were taken back up as as of
right now next year bonus depreciation
is at
40% yep um Edward asked how many pads
you need to be able to afford a manager
are they full-time that's a moving
Target a lot of it depends on if it's a
mostly a full-time or or mostly a
long-term or mostly a short-term Park um
it also depends on the area as a rough

[23:01]
it also depends on the area as a rough
number it also depends on the amount of
amenities right you could have a park
with 50 pads but no amenities you might
only need someone to check in every now
and then especially if it were a
long-term Park but if it were 50 pads in
a lot of amenities even though 50 is not
a lot uh you'd probably need a full-time
manager so depends on the the number of
amenities yeah and I'd say Revenue just
you know basic dollar economics you know
you have you know you're doing north of
a million bucks you could you could
afford someone if you're doing if you
got a park 10 minutes from your house
doing you know 200k you can't really you
probably can't afford to hire someone so
and you know in terms of sites you could
see a wide variety of like day a we call
it ADR average daily rental but you know
our Montana park right by glacier super
high ADR you know like like Airbnb rates
during the summer during the high
season not a not a crazy you know half
the number of sites of this but this
part
you know stable but a lot more sites so

[24:01]
you know stable but a lot more sites so
and this park has the revenue to afford
one too you know north of anything north
of a million you're you could probably
afford
someone okay John do you want to go
ahead and talk about the fund you can
share your screen and then Kenny buyers
I will get I will start back at your
question when we get back to the
questions after this yeah let's see
go all right can you see that okay yep
all right so I might what I might do is
um
SK skip skip to a number of slides some
of these slides are fairly similar to
what Chris presented on the Arkansas
deal because this is the Arkansas deal
is kind of like every deal that's our
buy box we're we're trying to buy Parks
like
that over and over and so the fund is
going to be an aggregation of similar
Investments and have
similar depreciation it's more
complicated obviously because it's an
aggregation of those Parks but returns

[25:02]
aggregation of those Parks but returns
um depreciation benefits and um
characteristics of the parks are going
to be similar just it's just numerous
Parks across 10 10 uh nine states I
believe in the
fund
and um let's see here so there's the
uh similar structure as well one one
thing to point out different with the
fund is the fund can sometimes take
limited partner positions so it's not
wholly owning like in the Arkansas deal
or any of our other deals we would let's
say depending on the liquidity of the
fund it's it's not going to buy the
whole park but it will invest now the
fund itself it has a more investor
friendly structure like I've invested a
decent amount into the fund myself
because it's just giving me broad
exposure to every deal for me and my
wife and but the the capital prior to

[26:00]
wife and but the the capital prior to
the GP getting anything cap full Capital
has to be returned so it's really a
return of capital fund um as as as
compared to the splits on any particular
particular property that's the main
difference between the structure of the
fund and individual Park
deals and it's it's a similar structure
too like the debt debt always comes
first then the the uh cash investor or
Class A limited partner interest than
the than the general general
partnership interests below that so if
there if there were let's say we sold
the park and there weren't enough cash
to there were limited cash we couldn't
hit all tiers it would go obviously debt
first then the cash investors and then
you know it's subject to the running
through the waterfall but if there's not
enough cash let's say it it the
investment didn't go well it would pass
it would passes through the waterfall
and the the the the cash investors are
are are treated looked at first so first
preferred return then return of capital

[27:00]
preferred return then return of capital
and then if there's not enough you know
we just as general partner we don't we
would not get anything we just didn't
succeed in that
investment um this this is kind of a
typical Deb overview you know Arkansas
deal had great seller financing so uh
we've got a couple seller financing
deals in there but typically we're
putting about 30% down or loan to values
about 70% on any park and you know we've
seen a big swing of rates over the last
12 months but we're starting to see get
term sheets now to refinance and new
more recent deals were back below 7% so
really really where Parks were a year
and a half ago rates are back to there
which is which is
excellent so and the M another thing
here you're getting diversification I'm
gonna scoot down and share some of the
parks that are are actually in the fund
so you could get a sense of sense of
what you're you're buying into and this
fund closes December this later this

[28:01]
fund closes December this later this
month so this is really kind of the last
last chance to to jump into this this
fund really fund one RV fund one
um before the end of the year so all
right here we go so so this is this is
one park one of the first parks in the
fund it's a it's a a Lake Lakeside RV
park 90
Acres uh on a 200 sites on a lake an
hour and a half I'm in Nashville so it's
an hour and a half for me
um beautiful property pretty Lake
developing Lake one of the few spots I
this is this is just an excellent
property like it's it's you come from
Nashville I don't know where all of you
live but Lake access is is is in high
demand and there's limited lakes and
this is this lake is really the last
Lake that has significant development
potential and it's it's it's happening
all around us so rates are we're our
ability to charge increased rates each
year and do other things like we're

[29:00]
year and do other things like we're
actually building 10 tiny homes on a
hill overlooking the lake so these are
like million dooll views an hour and a
half from Nashville we're able to we're
about to start marketing to an entirely
different
audience to to be customers of of the
park and there's the stability of all
the RV sites so beautiful beautiful
property uh here's another one this
one's wholly owned by the fund uh in
actually not too too far from Chris up
on off the interstate between Dallas and
OK Oklahoma City uh 50 50 Acre Site 100
107 RV sites on it and you know big big
kind of lake in the middle and this this
is one we're going to be investing into
more if you're in that area you'll see
some significant upgrades happening to
this park but this is this has a lot of
the qualities of a lot of good RV parks
it's right off the interstate great
location highly trafficked route uh good
good good size property with the with

[30:01]
good good size property with the with
the infrastructure that would be hard to
harder and much more expensive every day
it seems to replicate and rebuild a good
quality RV park and in many cases it's
what you what happened with MHP is
happening here where you're seeing
increasing restrictions and
regulations a lot of the parks you see
don't comply with some there's actually
National guidelines on how to build an
RV park now and I can tell you um
there's definitely what we've seen we've
looked at devel deals and there's
there's there's a number that have been
shut down so what happened in mobile
home parks where you have parked in
areas already existing you may not be
able to build another one so that which
is good if you're already already an
owner of one so this is this is a kind
of building a moat around what we're
doing and I think that's just gonna just
gonna increase based on what we're
seeing uh looking at development deals
development sites or even expansions of
of parks some of the the the red tape
and friction
restrictions it's a park in Kentucky uh

[31:01]
restrictions it's a park in Kentucky uh
just another nice double down the middle
steady producing cashlow
Park this one's up in another one near a
lake in Kentucky we have four parks near
a lake and there that's where these are
these were smaller Parks when we bought
them but they share common management so
there's efficiency we got we achieve
scale by buying smaller parks near each
other uh this is this is a this is a
park about
three and a half hours directly south of
me and Nashville right down 65 similar
characteristics right off the interstate
nice developable land with the the
infrastructure of a
park and and the amenities this this
one's going to be uh I'm this is
probably one of the ones I'm most
excited about what we're going to do to
it we're g to be significantly
developing this one and that's where you
know sometimes some parks are cash line
out the gate some parks some parks you
know what what Chris spoke to earlier is
that over you know 12 months from now

[32:01]
that over you know 12 months from now
this one's gonna going to crush I mean
this one is Cash flowing now a little
but you know it runs at high occupancy
so adding sites upgrading the
infrastructure and um you know adding a
sign that billboard off the
interstate our property people can see
right off the interstate we may even be
able to charge third parties for a panel
on that on that sign too um this is the
Montana Park um just you know gorgeous
gorgeous Place one of the place where
everyone in the company wants to go work
for the
summer did had an excellent season we'll
have we'll have our our report out on
this soon it we we were decently above
what the seller did and we haven't even
untapped all all all the revenue
there let's see here this is another one
in
Tennessee that's a right now a steady
steady stable stable property

[33:01]
this is a western western North Carolina
this is another partial position by the
fund um not this park was not damaged by
the
hurricane we actually were very
fortunate we have a couple Eastern
Tennessee and this one Western Carolina
Park and um it we we came out we came
out okay and it was we actually have
some displaced um families there so
that's um that was that was especially
in Nashville but um we we our properties
turned out
okay North Northeast Alabama
Park it's a West Western Kentucky Park
not too too far from the park the first
Park I showed on the lake um this this
one's also very
expandable and lastly uh we have a pos
position in in the northern Kentucky
Park to so in terms of in terms of
concentration you know you're getting
parks in Tennessee Kentucky
Alabama Carolina Montana Louisiana um

[34:03]
Alabama Carolina Montana Louisiana um
just a just a good um a good good
Diversified portfolio and we've never
had you know a casualty event we've
never had an any insurance
claim yet knock on wood um it will come
but I think
diversification and kind of some some
risk mitigation um is what you get is as
as part of the
fund also John I forgot to mention that
Northern Kentucky Park um we just closed
on it last month but we're still raising
for it to fill out our capex needs so
that is another option um if you wanted
to capture the 60% bonus depreciation by
the end of the year right that's right
yeah
so so you have those are really the two
options between now and and December
December 31st so we've closed on this uh
but there's still there's still a little
room to to jump in last minute so it's
really kind of a choice you know the
fund or or this deal
um to to to capture something you know

[35:00]
um to to to capture something you know
before year end and I just put the deck
for that in the
chat um anything else to talk about
bonus depreciation dropping that we
might not have
mentioned let's see I you know
um and then I'll get to the the
questions I mean people there's always
tons of I thought we had a slide on that
but I don't want to in there some
there's a slide happy to share but there
there's there can be lots of questions
around bonus
appreciation we have a great accounting
firm so what you'll see if you get
really in the Weeds on your tax
situation we'll we'll probably hand you
off to someone to recommend you to
someone you know we don't want to give
tax advice but there can be a lot of
questions around your your specific
situation but I mean in short what we're
talking about
is our V Parks qualifying really well
for bonus appreciation which applies to

[36:02]
for bonus appreciation which applies to
five and 15year property five and 15E
property is very common on ourv Parks
because RV parks don't have a lot of
vertical buildings like the building I'm
in now is an office building you know 27
and a half or 39 year property you can't
accelerate depreciation on that but RV
parks are mostly infrastructure
improvements wires Electrical uh
pavement it's it's the bones it's all
and 15 year property which it's almost
like the tax code was written for mobile
home parks andv Parks so they are they
are best in class and qualifying for
that and then we'll we will accelerate
that and take the max deduction year one
so this year you will get a K1 by March
15 and it'll show a significant loss
paper loss and um another the way I
think of it too there's a lot this can
get really nuanced but I almost think of
the appreciation is like a like a it's
almost like a tax-free loan like it's

[37:01]
almost like a tax-free loan like it's
not a freebie but it is it does mean
that you'll get a loss and the loss if
you don't use it elsewhere it carries
forward and will offset some of the the
distributions from this particular
property until your basis goes to zero
but it's not it's not a freebie forever
but it is it does increase that overall
return if we're talking like an 8 10%
cash on cash well uh effectively it's
higher because it it it depending on
your how that K1 balances how your
account offsets that on your tax return
um the real return is actually higher
than that because you're not paying
taxes on that and just to confirm John
someone in the questions was asking that
that would be uh a depreciation you
could claim on your 2024 taxes in 2025
right when you file in
April correct yeah if you're if you come
in the fund or Northern Kentucky those
are deals that close
this year so you would you'll get a loss

[38:01]
this year so you would you'll get a loss
on your K1 for 2024 which would come by
March 15 2025 and you you give to your
accountant and you know when you file
your taxes April 15 or if you go on
extension you know to October um it
would it would apply to this year's tax
return okay now Kenny's asking about
tiny homes and how that's gone with us
from what I understand it's kind of on a
park by- park basis uh we're not adding
them at every Park but the lakefront
Parks the Montana um cabins and or tiny
homes were appropriate and those gone
pretty well yeah I think there's
different models tiny
homes is an area where there's there's
so everyone everyone knows housing
there's this housing crisis
affordability is an issue and there's
this explosion of kinds of models and
it's you we've looked at so many
different models but on those sites the
ones you described the lake lots the
Montana you know those are where you
could charge a couple hundred bucks a

[39:00]
could charge a couple hundred bucks a
night during the season or more uh for a
rental yeah you could you could afford a
nicer model tiny home so we've we've
gone with ever rooms like on like on the
Kentucky Lake one those are we're doing
ever rooms which is a nicer model of
tiny homes well on other parks that if
you're if you're spending on on many a
park you could definitely the economics
are good if you you know if you're
spending 40 let's say $40,000 to if
you're getting 11 1,200 a month for a
monthly a month on a monthly lease yeah
that that that pencils that pencils well
but you can't you know on the lake lots
The Montanas yeah okay there we may be
spending a hundred grand or more on that
tiny home and really Furnishing it nice
to grab that 500 bucks a night you know
but it just it really just depends on
the market and by Park but there's we
always fill them like and we've I have
some fun stories on tiny homes too on
some of like an early Park we I think we
siteb built one for like eight Grand
like we bought one at foreclosure and
then our it's crazy story but we

[40:01]
then our it's crazy story but we
basically bought someone had bought a
tiny home got forecloses on it was
repoed we bought it it needed some
fixing up we did that and we got it on
site for under 10 grand and rented it
out gez which is great at like a
thousand a month so that's it's not
always like that and that's kind of
unique but um there are opportunities
and sometimes in some of the older sites
in ourv Parks you can you can infill in
infill tiny homes um just depending on
demand yeah I just I can't help but
compare this asset class to single
family which is where I started and the
single family you're you're lucky you're
hopeful to to make the 1% rule which is
your your monthly rent should be 1% of
the value of the asset $100,000 home
equals $1,000 a month but in this case
it's a luxury top-of-the-line $100,000
tiny home that fetches 500 a night right
or 350 and it at 20% occupancy even
those numbers are just crazy yeah and

[41:00]
those numbers are just crazy yeah and
you know it I you I tell people like to
like it's like we are we're buying this
real estate together
and you know we have our return
projections could go better could go
worse but we we have something real and
it's O this is a it play out plays out
over time like the one of the early
Parks we cash flow doing a tiny home a
month for like four months but we build
it
you know let the cash do it and we may
do some of that and sometimes it makes
sense to um maybe maybe it would make
sense if there's an opportunity on
there's one park where we may do this
we're gonna say look we're not going to
distribute and we'll tell investor we're
not going to distribute because it makes
more sense to invest in the park because
I actually already told investors that
and everyone was cool with it because
there's this data center going this is
one of our Louisiana Parks meta is
building this data center 25 minutes to
the East and there is nowhere to stay
say so um so the message we we we we

[42:00]
say so um so the message we we we we
talked about it we're like you know what
I need everyone to be cool with us not
Distributing um because there's a five
billion there's a multi-billion dollar
project with 5,000 contractors coming to
town and they got nowhere to live so the
more sites tiny homes whatever we can
get on our property It's Gonna Fill at
higher rates so things happen sometimes
for the good too yeah um Usman is asking
if we can share how other RV park
Investments have performed projected
versus
actual yeah I think we could um and I
could also do another call with that I
think out of out of 26
Parks we've had we've had one Capital
call which was to buy land I think that
there will be there will be
some we we've hit every distribution to
date there will be some we elective
pause like I'll put aside the one
there's a couple where it's a good
reason like that like that a big
Development coming hey let's reinvest
into the asset um so we're GNA make that

[43:02]
into the asset um so we're GNA make that
college GP and it's it's in everyone
it's one's interest in the end I think
that there's a couple parks that that
did suffer this year in some places
transient the the more transient Parks
were hit harder in this year um where
you have people more sensitive to fuel
prices now the monthly occupants the
longer termers that was up
year-over-year so and
pretty much every Park except for like
Montana which is fully seasonal every
park has some combination of monthly and
Transit which is good and then we've had
to adapt on those Parks so there are
going to be a couple parks where we
distribute Less in the short term this
year I think I could I could it's almost
I I there's 26 Parks so I could like in
my mind they're all there and you know
we and the team talk about them each
week but that's some of the shift we've
made we've shifted to more monthlies
you've seen Sun Communities do that in

[44:00]
you've seen Sun Communities do that in
the last in the last two years they've
shifted you know come going into a
potential recession whether it happens
or not you shift to more monthly monthly
occupants away from away from the
transients but the ones that were heavy
transient not Montana you know that
anything near like a really good like it
like Montana held up great um the you
know the lake one held up held up well
but we we do have some that there's no
doubt we've had a few that that got that
had kind of down years nothing nothing
down massively no Capital calls needed
um for that reason um so that that
that's that's like the p&l risk the
predictions are next year is going to be
a good year the overall trend too you
had nice up years in com kind of coming
a after Co so if you look like the trend
it's it's an uptrend of RV park usage Co
you had this and then you had kind of a
a Bel like you had had this bump and
then you had a little below and now it's
kind of evening back out back on the

[45:01]
kind of evening back out back on the
trend so it's a nice overall uptrend but
there there were some that that um that
were impacted by by just in inflation
which you know impacted a lot of things
so how many of our parks would you say
didn't hit what we had
hoped in
2024 so we by the end of this month I'll
know exactly we're we're going through
updates across them
all
um we still distributed on everything I
think this next this next cycle we'll we
we'll recommend some pauses um at least
at least probably into the season I I
don't know i' I'd say probably out of 26
it's
like uh six six to seven something like
that okay
cool um all right what is what do our
managers get paid and I know it's a
range some of them are managing three
Parks some of them one yeah

[46:03]
Parks some of them one yeah
um anywhere you know typically like you
know 40 to 55 somewhere in that range um
you know sometimes we if it's a bigger
Park they'll go up and then we have we
have district managers who over May
oversee multiple Parks who are higher so
okay and then Clint asked about the
capital call that was answered um the
one and you would if there were one you
have the right but not the obligation to
participate so you have your whatever
your percentage interest in the deal
winds up
being you have if there's a capital call
you can do it to maintain your
percentage share but you don't have to
and we we're not we can't take more
money from you we can't force you to
contribute more but you have the option
to and then how many of the 26 parks are
in the
fund it is um it is um
I believe 12 okay uh for the Springdale

[47:01]
I believe 12 okay uh for the Springdale
Park when is the estimated close date
we're shooting for February is uh would
60% bonus depreciation apply uh no um
Clint asked if your is your 15% irr
taking into account depreciation to come
up with that number no we don't it's
just to we don't we don't factor in it's
too hairy to yeah yeah that's just kind
of a cherry on top uh how best to
estimate the depreciation available for
$100,000 investment on parks that are uh
eligible for 60% bonus
depreciation would be 60,000 give or
take right around there yeah
yeah um Katherine what is the profile of
someone staying in your Park more than
50% are baby boomers what
age it's around so we're actually we're
working on a survey on this uh it's it's
in the you know 50 just anecdotally it's
50s
early 60s um but you know people living

[48:00]
early 60s um but you know people living
there you know we there are some
families on some parks too so it it's
really kind of a broad range a lot of
you know some have contractor with you
know contractors who are there um in
Cruz but you know a lot a lot of a lot
of folks in that especially in the the
trans especially in the transient you
know who are you have the actually it's
kind of a funny thing because you'll get
younger people now who who will travel
like because of Wi-Fi but in terms of
the Boomer the Boomer yeah it's like 50
60s
