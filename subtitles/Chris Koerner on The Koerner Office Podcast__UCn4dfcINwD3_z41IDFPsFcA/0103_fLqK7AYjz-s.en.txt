[00:01]
I'm not exaggerating when I say that
this was the best episode I have ever
recorded of the ker office I interviewed
a guy from Twitter that you've probably
never heard of he lays low he lives in
Knoxville Tennessee his name is Matthew
he owns a bunch of really freaking cool
businesses an Alpine Slide an indoor
snow facility where kids can go sledding
all kinds of really unique businesses
and you would never ever ever have heard
of either this guy or his businesses if
you weren't listening to this right now
I promise every minute of this episode
gets better and better the more you
listen to it because we get more
comfortable with each other we keep
talking we're ideating we're coming up
with ideas all over the place this isn't
just like a ploy to get you to listen to
the end but it gets better as you go and
we're going to talk again in three or
four weeks let me know if you want to
have him on again because we only got to
like a third or a quarter of his
businesses this guy's freaking awesome
we came up with amazing ideas that you
can copy yourself I hope you love this
episode let me know email me if you do
Chris co-founders

[01:00]
Chris co-founders
and I will have them on a second third
30th time whatever you want anyway enjoy
you go by Matt or Matthew I get called
both but usually Matthew is what I say
okay it's funny because you own so many
things that like I'm looking up to you
right like I want to talk to you no no
no I appreciate that it's something that
I feel like just watching your stuff
that we are very much alike in terms of
just like enjoying new things enjoying
making things how things operate
definitely how things tick
and exploiting opportunities when it
makes sense yeah I don't know that's the
vibe that I get from from you and
hopefully I'm close to right yeah no
that's it I'm just curious and I'm too
impatient to like to not find answers to
things and then once I find an answer
that's like oh this business could work
I'm too impatient to not try to make it
work like right away and yeah like I
even I I wouldn't call it impatience but
like when you set this up I was like
yeah let's connect whenever and then
you're like 3:30 or 2:30 or whatever and

[02:00]
you're like 3:30 or 2:30 or whatever and
just that directness of like well let's
just do it now let's do it tomorrow and
that catches me off guard a little bit
in a good way it's just I could do some
more of that in terms of just making
things happen and pushing things forward
and yeah just even appreciate yeah how
you went about that yeah well thanks
yeah and transparently when I have an
opposite reaction like all right well
let's yeah let's explore that some it's
like I'm just not that interested you
know there's an endless amount of cool
things cool people opportunities
and so yeah if you don't like get in
front of that person or whatever yeah
people find other things so yeah so
anyways I have admittedly not watched
your show mainly that's okay because it
get it would get me so like anxious
where just like listening to you or or
reading your stuff or like listening to
a great podcast I start having so many
ideas and it's like I can't do that
right now I'll save it for later Focus
yeah yeah yeah and I've got a lot of
catching up to do in terms of your
videos and stuff I definitely want to
get through them all time or whatever

[03:01]
get through them all time or whatever
yeah well I just want to hear like why
don't we start with you just telling me
everything that you own like everything
that you're doing that you're
comfortable talking about yeah of course
so yeah just as I guess a disclaimer I
am totally fine with whatever question
you want to ask or whatever and worse
comes to worse I say we'll save that for
later or something but yeah feel free to
ask about anything and I was thinking
about how to explain where I'm at and
what my history is and bold it down to I
grew up in a very like entrepreneurial
free household where I was allowed to
build and experiment and fail and and
all this stuff and so what that has led
to is this isn't planned but I feel like
every two or three years I do like some
major major project and each time I do a
major project it's bigger than the last
one whether that's good or bad and then
mixed in there's all these little
whether they're experiments or one-offs
or whatever I think part of that is I
just love the novelty I love the

[04:00]
just love the novelty I love the
creation I love just trying new things
and so anyways yeah so the big stuff I
think we originally connected on Pigeon
Forge snow which it is an amusement in
severe County Tennessee which in case
people aren't familiar that's home to
Dollywood and yeah it's a total tourist
town and that provides a lot of
opportunity to be unique in terms of
creating amusements and restaurants and
even lodging that people haven't seen
before and so anyways I built Pidge
Forge snow built it in
2017 is and opened in 2018 it uh is a
35,000 foot building uh that is uh
indoor snow complex that's opened all
year long um one thing that is really
unique about it is it's something called
temperature independent and so basically
when you go in the building it ranges
anywhere between maybe 65 degrees and 72
or whatever it is not a what they call

[05:00]
or whatever it is not a what they call
Subzero facility uh we're open all year
long um and yeah it's it's a pretty big
operation we've got depending on the
time of year we've got 30 40 even up to
50 employees we staff Around the Clock
we've got a morning and day shift that
leads into the afternoon and evening
shift and then when we close the public
we have a third shift that comes in that
blows snow all night and we do it all
over again and for the most part yeah
we're open up 365 days a year unless
there's something crazy so anyways I
guess my baby and before that I guess
the major project was I built an Alpine
Coaster or a mountain coaster right
around the corner yeah yeah just a
couple miles down the road and that was
maybe
2015 and I had never even heard of a
mountain coaster it was brought to me
through a group of people in town that
were also Amusement operators and owners

[06:03]
were also Amusement operators and owners
and they sent this video of this other
business this Alpine Coaster and there
was like an hourong wait all day long I
was like where was this one at so it's
on we's Valley Road but it's it was the
first one in the area it's called Smoky
Mountain Alpine Coaster and it's just a
couple miles away from pige for snv and
wait so I sorry I meant the one that
they brought to you that had a line out
the door was that one in Pigeon Forge
yeah yeah yeah yeah and I I think you
would agree with this sometimes the best
opportunities are you know being
inspired by other people's work and
being respectful of that but yeah
understanding that there's a market
there and trying to capitalize on it and
so anyways this group formed there were
10 people with me included and the big
thing was hey these Alpine coasters they
take a lot of area and land is at a
premium in in that area you need the
elevation change to make the uptrack
work along with the gravity the
downtrack and so there's just not a lot

[07:02]
downtrack and so there's just not a lot
of places that you can build something
like that zoning all that kind of stuff
there's a place right up the road just
coincidently of that competitor that was
identified and we ended up leasing part
of this guy's property to to build it
and it was awesome like it was such a
cool experience the the company that
that builds most of these coasters
they're out of Germany and they just
they're incredible with like their
precision and their engineering and
everything and so basically you write
them a big check and they build all that
in Germany how big of a check are we
talking that okay so now keep in mind
this was 2014 2015 numbers the coaster
itself was probably maybe 1.6 to 1.8
there was maybe half a million in terms
of shipping and that kind of stuff you
had to build it which was probably
another million but it's a mile long
track

[08:00]
track
six or eight foot sections at a time
steel yeah and so it's a giant Lego set
basically but still it's a lot of work
and but it's a pretty simple concept all
it's basically again it's there's a
loading station and there's single carts
it holds two people but typically it's
just one person a it connects to a cable
which takes them all the way up the up
trck just like maybe a traditional
roller coaster get to the top and then
gravity does the rest and they ZIP down
about a mile um and what's really cool
about it is you can control your speed
you've got handles and you can go fast
you can go slow and we capped ours
around maybe 30 miles an hour something
like that and when you're a couple
inches off the ground at times and going
30 miles an hour it feels way faster I
have seen grown men
scream and stop and all kinds of stuff
and so anyways it was and is a great
ride we went into this Alpine Coaster
boom Bo where after us that there were a

[09:02]
boom Bo where after us that there were a
lot that were popping up in the area but
everyone's kept doing more and more
money it it was just something that and
it still is something that really
resonates with people the whole family
can do it personally I don't like riding
roller coaster I get motion sickness so
even with me you just go slow and you
enjoy the view or it's a great date or
with kids or young old everything and so
it really really resonates with people
it is the most shocking thing was when
this first one opened up it is they were
about5 or16 a ticket and which doesn't
sound that bad but that's for one ride
right one ride and that's four five six
minutes depending on how fast or slow
you go and there's a discount for a
second ticket and you would see people
get off the ride smiling year to ear buy
another ticket even at a discount but
then go get back in

[10:00]
then go get back in
for sometimes up to an hour or two to
just do it again and so it was just
something it's they're great they're fun
I always recommend them to people you
didn't foresee that that people would
ride that many times I ride and I don't
know I I think I'm Frugal at heart and
so it's just like and then you start
thinking how are you spending this much
money yeah yeah and it's something that
it's something fames four five I believe
you have several kids is that right yeah
yeah so you know better than I we went
yeah we went Pigeon Forge I don't know
if it was yours or not but do do you
remember the name or I it's probably in
my email I've been thinking no problem
so ours is very easy because it's like
the most obnoxious one it's there's an
existing business there called goats on
the roof that is a shop that literally
just has goats on top of it and so
anyways you would definitely remember if
you went to ours OD no goats okay the no
gos and not us no big deal there are so
many in town now but
man they're just great they are these

[11:02]
man they're just great they are these
TurnKey businesses believe it or not if
you have the capacity to write a fairly
large check and if you have the spot to
put it it is it's actually pretty easy
it's a giant assembly line and it
doesn't take that many employees you can
especially compared to your snow place
right oh yeah definitely and so anyways
we had success there and I learned a ton
I was the larg just shareholder there so
I felt like I had a responsibility to do
everything from marketing to operations
to I'd be working the ticket booth when
somebody wouldn't show
up and and so anyways I was also by far
the youngest in the group and the group
ranged from like me who was probably
late 20s maybe 30 and the oldest guy
there was maybe like 88 or 90 and so
there was like huge mismatch there and

[12:00]
there was like huge mismatch there and
whether it's right or wrong I think I
developed a real chip on my shoulder of
that I was the kid or didn't know what I
was doing or all this stuff and so as
that chip grew and grew and grew I
reached a point in a couple years of
running the coaster is like I need to
prove to like the whole world that is
not true that I am creative and I can
succeed and that's when I started
thinking about snow and again I can't
stress it enough there was nothing like
that at the time and so real quick can
yeah can I ask a couple question before
we move on to snow I've got like a
zillion questions ask all you want what
made them want to come to you in 2014 to
be a shareholder had you already done
cool stuff or Not Cool by probably their
definition it was a money thing and
that's a whole another lesson of the
group was broken down between some Sweat
Equity in terms of putting the deal
together and obviously at some point
there has to be money I'm a little rusty
on the numbers but I think we I think

[13:02]
on the numbers but I think we I think
the group put in maybe a million dollars
all in all and we borrowed I want to say
2.4 2.2 something like that and and so
anyways my family is fairly well known
in in the area I come from several
generations of entrepreneurs in the real
estate space and so anyways I think it
was just something that the name was
known and that was how that connection
was made and at the time when that got
brought up the plan was like okay let's
invest $25 $50,000 let's just buy a
lottery ticket sure whatever and things
kept happening where maybe somebody else
dropped out or they couldn't find
another investor and one thing leads to
another and it's like oh my gosh here we
are like writing bigger and bigger
checks and but then it's like the sunk
cost fallacy was like I'm in this deep
let's just keep going it's not going to
be the end of the world if it doesn't
work out but this was not the original

[14:00]
work out but this was not the original
plan and so anyways that's how that that
wound up okay so that probably also put
a chip on your shoulder where you're
like listen guys I'm more than just a
check like I could do this myself I
don't need all year right so was the the
number one thesis like hey man this
Alpine Coaster just opened it's the
first one in the area they're crushing
it they can't keep up with their demand
there needs to be a second we could be
the second was that kind of the whole
thesis yeah definitely if anyone's even
Vaguely Familiar with kind of the Pigeon
Forge Gatlinberg area it has this bad
WAP of that's just go-kart tracks and
t-shirt shops or whatever and a couple
decades ago it definitely was that but
the reason it was that somebody opened
up a go-kart track and yep there's wild
stories of especially for credit cards
were prevalent just massive amounts of
cash a lot of probably Shady accounting
and taxes and stuff and so you see
somebody doing that and then somebody
opens up one beside the street blah blah
blah blah and it seemed like like there
was just this demand for go-kart tracks

[15:01]
was just this demand for go-kart tracks
and t-shirts and so that's why we wound
up with so many things like that but
obviously people want more than just to
ride a go-kart track but a go-kart track
is something that anybody can comprehend
how that business works it's very easy
very familiar and then maybe you add you
spice it up a little bit and you have a
tunnel or something
and The Coasters were very similar model
and I think the main reason it exploded
like it did in our area and and across
the US is because again it is believe or
not very TurnKey it's engineered this
company from Germany you pay them to
come out they'll drop the site PL all
this if you hire construction crew to
build it then it's just like go-kart
track 2.0 and so yeah I think it's just
very accessible and that doesn't seem
that intuitive it's like very turny and
so anyways I think that's why I forget
what you asked but I think that's why

[16:02]
what you asked but I think that's why
that that was popular and that resonated
with entrepreneurs in the area okay so
you and a few others put in seven
figures you borrow seven figures
probably takes one to two years to get
open or so we about a year we had hiccup
after Hiccup and ended up getting close
to the end and ran out of money in
hindsight the guy that put the budget
together it was like on the back of a
napkin he he was just guessing on stuff
and we're like okay yeah that sounds
right and so then when it's like man
like you didn't include like the cost to
pave the parking lot whatever and so we
I think we were short
maybe 400 to
500,000 and I don't know the attitude of
the bank at the time but they they
extended our loan that amount I think
they were probably also like Hey we're
this deep in it too and so anyways yeah
so yeah we put in about one and probably
ultimately borrowed two and a half maybe

[17:01]
ultimately borrowed two and a half maybe
2.75 what did opening week look like and
I also want to know like first year what
did that look like and then as more
competitors what did it look like last
year on the revenue traffic basis yeah
so I I have always loved marketing
especially like growth hacky little like
tricks and at the time Facebook had this
ability to where you could download
these tools and stuff and basically
go to a competitor's business page
download all their users and yeah yeah
yeah it's it was amazing and then you
retarget to them yes and basically
uploaded all of the competitor who the
competitor was doing and still is
amazing they have they went viral so
many anyways and so their Facebook page
that was when Facebook was really
popping off too and so I for months I I
ran these ads against their list and and
basically said something like if you

[18:01]
basically said something like if you
like them come check us out whatever it
said and we also came in at a lower
price point too I I don't know if that
was good or bad but we're angled the
cheaper one and so I are you still the
cheaper one marketed pretty heavy so
fast forward a little bit I sold out in
2021 22 but yes they are still I I
believe the cheapest one okay so you
marketed pretty heavy marketed heavy we
opened up in like a nasty February day
or whatever and I remember we opened up
and we advertised a $5 ride for our
first couple days or whatever which is
really cheap and remember we did like I
don't know eight or10 thousand and
everyone was like oh my gosh what you
expect the weather was so bad it's kind
it was kind of in the off season and I
don't know maybe maybe a few thousand
but I wasn't really familiar with that
the amusement business yet I I remember
that whole week I work the ticket booth

[19:01]
that whole week I work the ticket booth
and so somebody would come up and say
like whatever four or five tickets and I
punch it in and I said okay your total
is I don't know 100 bucks or whatever
and when I would see the hundred on the
screen before I uh told the customer I
was like wincing because it's like oh my
gosh like they're gonna say no yeah
they're gonna yell at me all that kind
of stuff and it was just amazing like
people on vacation yeah have a different
mindset yeah and so we were very heavy
in cash in ter we were probably 70% cash
30% credit card and you just see people
open up their wallet and just toss you
100 bucks and I remember the first night
we didn't have a safe we didn't have
anything and I used to always carry a
backpack around and so I just that night
I I just shoved all the
cash yeah yeah and my kitchen table just
lay it all out and whatever and it was
very in terms of the operations very

[20:01]
very in terms of the operations very
hacked together very just build and
iterate fast and that I love that that
is so me it's the best part and oh yeah
definitely and but something that first
year we probably did I don't know maybe
$2 million give or take we wow just sold
two things no sorry we sold three things
we sold a ticket which was adult ticket
and the child's ticket uh which is $12
$15 then we had a re-ride ticket which
was $5 which is very popular and then we
also had a photo booth that would sell
people their photos on the and so
anyways that was 100% our total revenue
sources on the property like I said
there was an existing business this kind
of gift shop and food and goat food and
all that and so I don't know his numbers
I would guess he definitely Revenue wise
had to be over a million dollars and so

[21:01]
had to be over a million dollars and so
on the property there was probably three
maybe four million do Changing Hands
obviously I didn't have access to to
part of that but anyways yeah that kind
of gives you a kind of a yeah a range
and so our first year we did really well
and we continued to grow we we built the
coaster pretty much ourselves like as in
somebody in the group had a construction
background and and and so anyways we
every year we paid the price in terms of
you you've got this massive steel
structure on the side of the mountain
this mountain and we would get when I
say shifts in the track I'm talking
about four inches here six inches there
but this the design was so precise that
if if you if it started to get out of
whack you just got grinding and wear and
tearing so basically what where I'm
getting out is we close maybe every year
for anywhere between a week to three or
four weeks to fix stuff that I don't

[22:00]
four weeks to fix stuff that I don't
think other coasters went through and so
that always I feel like shot us with
having that like just blowout year and
but we all we were very consistent we
just we had a lot of things working
against us but but profitable but just
you want to see that growth you want to
double every year whatever yeah so pair
that with like literally some years
there were two coasters being built that
year and every year there there was a
new competitor
wow and yeah I think the area so Seville
Pigeon Forge Gatlinburg I think they're
up to maybe 10 coasters now wow and I
know of at least two that are uh planned
and I assume going to get built and I
studied the competitor the original one
Smoky Mountain Alpine Coaster so much I
would go down to their parking lot and
I'd sit there on my phone and just kind
of do the yeah count how many people yep
and man like they never slowed down and

[23:00]
and man like they never slowed down and
it's still to this day the most baffling
thing to me that especially them it was
almost like the more competition that
came in they were doing even more
themselves and and and and so anyways
that industry is very strange in terms
of the demand and the supply it's
something that I keep thinking that it's
going to down yeah yeah but it doesn't
seem to and the profit margins are
incredible and so it allows
a lot of room for error there the fourth
maybe fifth coaster that went in the
area I remember I knew some people
involved with it and I can't say 100%
sure but I think their budget was about
eight or 10 million and at that time and
even still this day I was like that
amount of money that is insane wow but
they print and so it really
shows that if it can support a buildout
like that regardless what their terms
are whatever yeah it's just impressive

[24:01]
are whatever yeah it's just impressive
it just shows that the demand is there
it's still there they're all I think
doing well and so it's a super
interesting business if you haven't done
a deep dive on them like oh I'm planning
it now yeah yeah and I've thought a lot
about where are other areas that you can
do those and and they're all around the
country you kind of got to have the
terrain right you have to have the
terrain which so so something really
cool is the German company their their
name's Wiggins they were Innovative
enough to figure out how they can build
these without having these massive up
trcks and so basically what they do you
still have to have quite a bit of area
and elevation but they chop up the up
trck and
so maybe instead of a thousand feet or
whatever of uptrack they might do three
or 400 feet of a smaller up trck do a
smaller down trck do another up trck and
so on and so forth that coaster I was
referencing earlier with the 8 or 10
milon dollar budget they have four up

[25:00]
milon dollar budget they have four up
trcks and that was the first one to do
that and I thought it would fail because
yeah the best part of the coaster is the
downt trck and so you would go up a and
then just when youd start getting going
and you're smiling and you're going fast
you're stopping again and and you're
doing another okay let's slow down do
another up trck to this day I do not
understand why people resonate with
those but they do and so do they like or
are they just in business because they
don't know what they're going into when
they buy a ticket I thought the same
thing I was like ah they will they'll
burn out because word will get around
and blah blah blah blah blah man I was
wrong on that I I what do they charge
more three as much right well sure
they're probably I don't know $18
something like that the best scenario is
when you can put two people per cart
it's just wildly more profitable almost
all of it is automated and has got a
way better over the years and basically

[26:01]
way better over the years and basically
the operator is responsible for helping
the the customer get on the cart making
sure they're buckled in and then past
that the computer kind of takes over and
so basically a perfect scenario is a
cart leaving the station maybe every 20
seconds 18 seconds something like that
and I've done this you can work
backwards on the MTH there even the best
of the best coaster they're CA at
whatever that is and there are
definitely times that we operated a lot
of times that we operated every 20
seconds that does take some skill that
is not just and but then you're always
going to have you're gonna have somebody
that's up on the downt trck and freaks
out and goes really slow slows the whole
thing down this and that yeah just a
bunch of crazy stuff and the carts are
really cool because they developed a
system that basically it's an automatic
breaking system where they cannot they
cannot Collide and so if it senses a

[27:00]
cannot Collide and so if it senses a
cart going slow in front of it it will
slow down too now some people get really
pissed when they're halfway up and
they're slowed down to crawl the rest of
the way because grandma is just enjoying
the view but minus those things yeah
like you can again you can work
backwards on Revenue you're very weather
dependent summer is by far the the best
season they made these I call them rain
shields but basically like a plastic
covering
and I don't know I don't think that
really resonates with people people do
it but they're going to be way slower
when it rains but the insane thing is
there are a lot of people that still
want to do it in the rain it feels
terrible as it's just pelting you in the
face and it's something that they'll sit
there and wait for the rain to clear and
do it again and so anyways weather
dependent temperature dependent it there
is no worse feeling than when it's 30
degrees and you're going 30 miles an
hour down that Hill your face is just
Frozen there's still people that do it

[28:01]
Frozen there's still people that do it
and so anyway you kind of hack together
somebody's Revenue If You Give Good
estimates for those categories I just
said and what are your net margins like
either yours or the industry's yeah yeah
definitely it's something that with all
these kind of amusement businesses
you're really heavy on initial
investment and really depends on how you
like advertise that or how you're
accounting for that but you know that
and then you your cost from there you've
got next to no utility costs minus
bathrooms and a little bit of
electricity you've got a little bit of a
repair and maintenance budget and
ongoing and then Staffing wise you can
run the coaster with three or four
people probably good to have six or
seven but so anyways when you kind of
work backwards on that once you get over
your hurdle rate of just Debt Service
and stuff like that there were
definitely times we were over 50%
margins and then oh my gosh yes and you
just got to think the the cost of

[29:00]
just got to think the the cost of
selling one more ticket once you're over
that like it's nothing yeah yeah yeah
and your staff's already there the
electrics gonna the lights are going to
be on and
so it's about C can you be someware that
you have enough demand yeah to get that
hurdle rate I would be interested in
doing another one not in my area but I
think the cost now to do it if somebody
asked me to look at their budget and
they think about doing
one if they were less than $10 million I
would be asking a lot of questions um
and and so you know that hurdle of 10 or
12 million however you acquire that
money or dead or whatever that adds up
if it percent interest rates or whatever
they're still doing them so obviously it
works but I would be a little bit more
hesitant on that but I've seen other
areas where people have put these in
there's a little there's a little town
in Georgia Helen Georgia and I think

[30:01]
in Georgia Helen Georgia and I think
there's a couple there that do okay
Branson Missouri has several I think
they do well I've never seen a coaster
close we'll put it like that yeah um
yeah yeah there's some out west in the
Rockies I guess that are beautiful like
insane views and yeah so if you can find
an area that makes sense from just a
demand wise the elevation is tough but
not impossible if you're in well even
like I I've brainstormed ideas like how
could you do it without any Hill if
you're in like Kansas or whatever I
don't know if it work but I've got it's
just a roller coaster at that point
right yeah yeah yeah yeah and so
especially if you did it like in Kansas
I know nothing about the Midwest like
that but you'd really want to be
confident you've got the demand but
that's something too it's like if you're
in an area that there's not a lot to do
in terms of like for kids or birthday
parties or whatever like it it I think

[31:02]
parties or whatever like it it I think
it'd be such a hit and so yeah I love
coasters I I I think they're great
businesses we were really big on safety
just running a really safe operation
that was important to me we probably
spent more on those kind of costs than
most which I would never encourage
somebody not to do that but even that
it's not that costly did did you ever
have accidents what did your insurance
cost look like yeah definitely it's
something that we would have little
mainly like an accident would be when
two cars collided and and how that would
happen is I talked about this German
engineering and they developed these
battery packs on each of the carts to
control the automatic braking and they
were so precise with it that they said
okay well a card's going to be on the
track every for seven minutes or
whatever so this battery is going to
last eight minutes and when it comes
back around recharge and so that's great

[32:00]
back around recharge and so that's great
until somebody is you know stops up
there or or whatever so anyways a low
battery in that regard you'll have
people and it's like rubber to rubber
but it'll still shock you so there's
Whiplash I guess there we did this is
public we had a woman break her arm it
was a seat Bel issue where her seat belt
I'm not going to say who's at fault but
anyway her seat belt ended up where it's
just like a car seat Bel so it goes over
the shoulder and through your lap and
she had she's at fault she did it she
was an idiot come on and so anyways she
was uh on the heavier side and and her
her body leaned one way and then through
force and just I guess her muscles she
basically she could not correct her body
back up and so anyway she broke her arm
and I feel terrible about that there was
there's a period of time just by pure
coincidence that
ourselves the original coaster the smok

[33:00]
ourselves the original coaster the smok
Mountain alpine coaster and one in
Gatlinburg all had a very serious
accident like same week of each other it
was like July 4th weekend that was a bad
week for the Alpine industry terrible it
was terrible call that black Thursday
well the news are just you got all these
reporters and anyways it was a terrible
time learned a lot about PR a lot about
safety and laws and stuff but anyways so
that actually that period did drove up
everybody's insurance I think I can't
speak to the other ones like one of them
from what I know there was an employee
after hours that kind of rode rode the
coaster down like a
surfboard it I agree but but anyways he
he got hurt and anyway so maybe I don't
know the final payout Insurance wise to
each of these but maybe call a million
dollars each on the high side but rates
went up but they didn't like double so
insurance is relatively very cheap in

[34:01]
insurance is relatively very cheap in
the beginning off the top of my head I
feel like we paid I don't know maybe 50
$60,000 for our first year not bad at
all yeah yeah it went up I don't know
what it is now there's so many that I
would be and there's so many more safety
innovations that I wouldn't be surprised
if insurance was still pretty reasonable
obviously people are opening them up and
able to get insurance and and all that
so yeah that that is is a common
question of I'm sure insurance is crazy
or whatever and yeah it's expensive but
I don't know I I don't think it's that
bad still a single digit percentage line
item I mean yeah yeah definitely what
about your land lease cost and how long
is the lease do I I imagine that's
probably a pretty big barrier to entry
right finding the right topography and
the right owner that's willing to do
this yeah yeah so with our situation
we you know in that area and especially
my dad and my grandparents everything
operated just very much handshake kind

[35:00]
operated just very much handshake kind
of deal you have a rough price you're
not getting down to an exact dollar and
so anyways we we had a handshake deal
that we eventually got on on but I think
it was $6,000 a month with no price
increases and fairly good terms all that
kind of stuff I I think we got the
better end of the deal on that but ours
leasing the land is fairly
uncommon up there I think a lot of
people buy theirs yeah the good news
about that is if you're confident on
where you're putting it more or less
this is really crappy land like it's you
want it rough you can't do much with it
exactly and and how many acres are we
talking we had the guy
had 10 or 12 and there was a parcel
beside it that we as a group bought it
was five more Acres I think we paid
200,000 or so and the
like the first coaster the Smoky
Mountain alpen coaster they've got maybe

[36:02]
Mountain alpen coaster they've got maybe
40 or 50 acres it's a side of this
mountain beautiful but you can't do much
with it and I think if I remember
correctly looking up their records maybe
for all of that they paid seven or
800,000 which don't get me wrong is a
lot of money but is a steal for what
they're doing and yeah there's that nice
balance of a lot of this land people
can't think of another way to use it and
so it's relatively cheap yeah I mean I
went on an Alpine Slide when I was on my
church mission in Hungary there was one
in this city called chapron s o p r o n
and it was like the missionaries would
always go on it it was the best and I
think it was super cheap and it wasn't
even mountainous it was just like a hill
interesting I don't even know if you
need mountains right and so oh true yeah
yeah yeah a hill can work very well and
not even like I'm obviously live in
Tennessee I live in Knoxville which is
about an hour away or whatever I'm
sitting here at my house and you can't
see it but we live on top of this hill

[37:00]
see it but we live on top of this hill
it's nothing crazy it's like what you
see everywhere and it wouldn't make
sense but I could put a coaster here my
neighborhood loaded at the bottom of the
hill and it this is perfect you thought
about it you thought about it yeah yeah
definitely it's just again it's a very
efficient business and so anyways my
point is there are so many places you
could put it I would be more hesitant
about okay what makes sense in terms of
the demand from what I know a lot of the
places in the US at least are either
tourist spots ski resorts that kind of
thing which makes total sense but I've
got a theory that amusements whether
you're talking about snow or a coaster
or whatever I if you're able to put one
intelligently in just a normal City like
here
Knoxville I I I think it could actually
do well I don't think it has to be a
trist
yeah do I want to gamble $10 million and

[38:00]
yeah do I want to gamble $10 million and
find that out probably not but I don't
know I might I could be talked into
taking that bet I think under the right
circumstances so well yeah let me know
what you think of this idea I've had
this idea for a while so yeah you you
may have seen the Tweet but I we did a
50 state tour as a family in our RV and
we like in Arkansas Arkansas is known
for Gem Mining and you can find diamonds
you can find rubies and that's kids love
that right like any human on the planet
has treasure hunting baked into their
DNA right of course so my kids it was
like 100 degrees I was like all right
can we leave but I paid 130 bucks or
something you pay like 15 bucks for a
bucket you pay 10 bucks for it's just
crazy but that's what you do and then we
went to Alaska and we panned for gold
the real I'm like the real thing yeah we
panned for gold and that was like 150
bucks and then I thought like why is
this stuff only in the middle of nowhere
and I thought you know you can so I
started looking like where's the closest
place you can pan for gold in to Texas

[39:02]
place you can pan for gold in to Texas
and it you can do it in Colorado right
so that what if you literally just
brought dump trucks full of dirt from
Arkansas to Dallas and dirt from
Colorado to Dallas and you had a DFW
area Mining facility it's just for kids
and you could do authentic gold from
Alaska or Colorado and authentic and it
could just be all be one in one place
like don't you think that could work
there's there's 9 million people here we
had or the land owner at the coaster he
had gym mining there it's a little bit
one of those once you learn how the
sausage is made kind of thing it was
like out back a bunch of dirt and sand
and he you can buy they just put gems in
there right whatever but but no people
like another one very efficient to run
and you can even buy these setups these
gym mining setups that just cycle water
you have somebody overseeing but very
popular there is a dedicated gym Mining
facility
in the middle of pigeon great location

[40:00]
in the middle of pigeon great location
so that has something to do with it but
they print you are taking it in a more
authentic way and I have thought
about I I have thought about not even
like taking it that far but it's such a
good business even the way we do it in
town which is a little janky and I think
it's ethical but it's not you're not
getting real gold and kids love
it you know one thing that I found with
all these things adults love these
things too yes but they need an excuse
to do it and so it's like like yeah if
if an adult does it by himself he's a
serial killer if he does it with his his
kids then he's a good dad yeah exactly
and so we have at snow once we got open
we I kind of transformed our gift shop
and built this big candy store and just
hundreds of different kinds of weird
candy and this and that and it does
really well I saw it I I was there okay
oh yeah yeah yeah and so obviously yeah
kids love it but the parents for

[41:00]
kids love it but the parents for
themselves that's our customer believe
it or not because it's just an easy
excuse they're not going to buy a some
neon pink sour candy on a Monday back
home or whatever but but they're in that
setting and they still want to exact
exactly and so whether it's candy or gym
mining or whatever I think yeah uh I
love those kind of situations where like
you're able to tap into a Nostalgia
element put a Twist on it where like for
me indoor snow tubing you might not have
ever been to us or even seen a picture
but you can think about what that is in
your head now whatever you come up with
in your head odds are it's not going to
look exactly like what I built and so
there's like this there's this
uniqueness there's also familiarity that
you car it well together and if you go
too unique with something where you have
to educate the customer
it can but yeah yeah yeah and there's

[42:01]
it can but yeah yeah yeah and there's
somebody that's competing for the same
customer in a different way and so yeah
like you were so
right gold and Mining and all that it's
human nature thought yeah I don't know
how old are you 37 I'm 37 too so anyways
you probably remember when that Gold
Rush show first came out on Discover
yeah yeah I watched it that's why
Everyone's Watching everyone's watching
you go to NASCAR cuz you want to see D
learnart die yeah of course of course
and so it's something that when that
came out like yeah I I remember and my
dad has all this junk heavy equipment
that was fun when I was a kid and now
it's just a pain but it's like Dad let's
take this and let's start digging some
and it's just like this American Pickers
have you seen that show yeah exactly
exactly and so yeah I can only speak
being a male I there's something that
resonates there I I think women would
like that to I know kids do and so
anything I do I try to really make sure

[43:02]
anything I do I try to really make sure
I can do something that resonates in
some way with the whole family young to
old all that kind of stuff well speaking
I I think that's a great idea one of the
one of the things that went the most
viral when Facebook live and Instagram
live first came out were Asian women
cracking open oysters to find pearls
like those would have thousands or
millions of concurrent viewers because
it's like is there a pearl how big is
the Pearl it's just that's incred I
think it's irrespective of gender like
we're all treasure Hunters we all want
to see what of course it's funny you
said that we actually and you might have
seen this before uh in our gift shop at
snow currently we sell these kits
they're these toys and it is like a clay
a hard clay one looks like a diamond one
looks like a bar of gold there's a
couple others and yeah it comes with a
little hammer and you can open it and on
the back it even says one in I don't
know 100 actually have a of gold in it
and we sell those

[44:00]
and we sell those
for10 or2 something like that I think I
think we buy them for two three four
dollars something and yeah they're
really popular and yeah I always look at
them I was like I'm gonna take one of
those home I haven't but I see I see the
appeal D I mean how's this idea so I I
thought I tweeted a while ago about
putting bull riding in the mall right
like an inflatable and it was like oh
insurance they Mall wouldn't yeah
there's a mall out there that would okay
I do want to test that what if we took
one of the gem mining kits and put it in
a very high trffic popular Mall tell me
that wouldn't work I I totally agree so
when you said the bull riding thing or
another like principle that I try to
stand behind is like you got to be able
to have turnover efficiently and and
obviously as much as possible and bull
riding or something that's a very
singular like 1% at a time kind of thing
obviously it can work but something like

[45:00]
obviously it can work but something like
gym mining or coaster snow what whatever
you know you can have so many people
going at once and the idea is if you
knock something out of the park you can
just keep like you've got endless supply
we all of The Coasters ran into an issue
where we had more demand than we did
Supply we
have we did well but we weren't the the
best one but many days the line would be
hour hour and a half two hours long and
I thought about I did not end up doing
this but I thought about couple years
ago search pric please tell me I have
thought about that yeah that's a
different story but purchasing one of
The Coasters existing business or
building a new one and doing a second
one beside it and whether they're
dueling or you just have double the
capacity if you were confident with the
demand or if I had that original coaster
that's still right there today first
thing I would do is put a second one
there and like they instantly double

[46:02]
there and like they instantly double
their money like instant and probably
still have a line you're drisk and a lot
of cool stuff you're der risked you
already know the demands yeah and and so
again it's a good problem but their a
Coaster's problem is a turnover problem
we have turnover problems and
bottlenecks when we get really busy at
snow and so I'm always thinking about
yeah if you do something how can use
either satisfy as many customers if if
you're really popping off or you make up
for it in other ways like it's a
premium people still want to do it but
you know you you don't have as many
customers at a time and so where I'm
going with that is yeah like the gym
mining thing and and they're a lot like
arcade games like surprisingly a lot of
people don't know this but all the
arcade games that you see that Xbox in
it or whatever like literally the
operator programs like you you open it
up the computer asks you how much much
is the prize worth and you say $1,000
say how much do you want to make on that

[47:01]
say how much do you want to make on that
and you say I'd like to make 2,000 and
then you hit okay and then literally
whether it's a crane game or whatever it
literally won't pay out until then and
so it's like if you have the demand it
is such a precise little business and
that's the same with gy mining where if
you could work the numbers where like
you imagine if you could have legit
prizes like did not common but like a
legit Diamond a legit gold
and it's same thing you work backwards
you say what can I afford what margins
and then yeah make like I'm also really
big fan of like if you're going to do
something like that like how can you
like 10x the experience or 10 times
cheaper 10 times more expensive or 10
times better rather than just this
marginal little we've got slightly more
gold or whatever like it'd be awesome
like the Mr Beast model of anything he
does he just goes really big and it's
this wow factor yeah no love that big
fan of malls too I've always been
interested in capitalizing on that even

[48:01]
interested in capitalizing on that even
though they're on the decline but I
still think there's a lot of opportunity
there yeah I'm just I'm getting so many
ideas as you talk like okay I'm just GNA
spit them all out so I yeah I recently
thought of the phrase illusion of
saturation right where let's say you
were able to find the next Dollywood the
next Pigeon Forge and maybe there was
one Alpine Slide maybe none you go in
there you open an Alpine Slide and
you've got to line out the door and then
it's like okay okay then you go to your
investors you raise a $100 million and
you start planting different company
branded alpine slides all over that area
it's not your same brand because you're
not really benefiting from that from
having a chain in fact you might be even
doing yourselves a a disservice right so
you name them all differently brand them
a little differently but the
infrastructure is all the same from the
outside looking in any potential
competitors like oh man there's like six
under construction right now like I'm
not into it then you can still share the
email list you could still
cross-pollinate the lookalike audiences

[49:01]
cross-pollinate the lookalike audiences
like I just I love that idea I go to
Texas Roadhouse or chick or or
Cheesecake Factory and there's always a
line and it's like why don't you open
another one next door or double your
prices it just pains me to see people
walking away I totally agree especially
with retail there's like this thing of
like if you don't have a lot of people
there even if your product's good like
it it somehow deters other people from
going if your pocket lot's empty slow or
whatever and then it starts to go the
other way where when there's more people
there it's like oh well I guess we have
to go there and then obviously like you
also hit something where I'm sure like
take the coasters when somebody says oh
my gosh there's an hourong line we are
not going to do that that's got to
happen but yeah it's it's this thing of
like you said like being able however
you do it through like multiple
businesses locations or the same yeah
like it's all about matching supply and
demand in a way that balances out
hopefully and yeah no that's it would

[50:00]
hopefully and yeah no that's it would
take a lot about The Coasters to do that
you'd need X number of location scouted
out you'd want to secure that land
whether that's through options or or a
lease or whatever in in a lowrisk way
you do have in that instance you do have
a lead time of building it and order all
that kind of stuff and obviously you've
got a large cap
requirement yeah I I think it could
definitely work it would be a big it'd
be a grand slam you would just the
planning is going to make it break you
locations does this make sense all that
kind of Stu yeah I feel like
manufacturing that much fake
saturation doing it in alpine slides
might be like the riskiest the most
expensive way to do it you could take
that same principle let's talk about a
$2,000 bull riding thing in a mall like
the Galleria in Dallas four stories
300,000 feet and there's eight Starbucks
in there right so yeah I mean like I'm

[51:01]
in there right so yeah I mean like I'm
exaggerating but it's so big that most
people never make it to the whole mall
so you you could do it there you could
put like a bull riding place at one
entrance oh this is crushing it let's
put it at that entrance let's put it to
that you know what I'm saying like you
could do it a lot cheaper so a safer way
of that so I referenced this the candy
store that I added
on incredible business it is so good
high margins very easy all that kind of
stuff I have been very tempted at times
to go somewhere else Knoxville wherever
and yeah like whether it's malls or
whatever like why aren't there more
candy scores and that's the same kind of
thing like in your instance in in that
mall if you've got one that works yeah
just I don't know if it can handle four
or 10 or whatever but yeah just like you
keep doubling down on it once you know
that you've got a winner and there's if
it works on one side of the mall there's
no reason why it's not going to work on
the other side of the mall assuming
they're equal in terms of demand and

[52:01]
they're equal in terms of demand and
stuff and yeah no that's you called that
the illusion of saturation is that right
yeah yeah I like that yeah and it's like
there's certain businesses that you only
find in certain places right like you
see candy store in the tourist areas or
in an airport but like why don't you
ever see them in strip malls or like I I
I totally agree why can't you take a
candy store you know how sometimes you
can buy candy like by the pound that's
what we do yeah why can't you take like
a shrunk down version of that take like
the 20% most popular items and sell that
as a service to gas stations or
something where it's like listen here's
here's the scale here's the bag we're
going to refill it you don't do anything
people they'll weigh they'll check out
and it's going to take 80 square feet
and you can just put it like kind of
like the The Hunt Brothers Pizza model
at gas stations like candy or
something yeah incredible because candy
is something that you've got so much
room there to be creative and for our
store and and others that we obviously

[53:00]
store and and others that we obviously
weren't the first to do something like
that it's about being bold and bright
colors and bright lights and weird candy
and all this so you can really really do
some very cool stuff one thing I think
I've had employees get worked up about
or other people what if a customer
steals some or what if they pour a bag
and just leave it or whatever business
who cares it doesn't matter I'm at 80%
margins like they stole 20% yeah
I probably eat 10 handfuls of candy
every time I'm at snow just that's what
keeps me going and so we are able to go
through my addiction and still do very
well and yeah it's just like it's so
easy to run it clean up is also very
easy and even if you design if you're
doing by the pound like you design uh
systems to catch all the candy and keep
it clean and everything we have I don't
know if this is in other areas but we
have General stores like kind of old
timey whatever there's a popular one

[54:00]
timey whatever there's a popular one
here in Knoxville and yeah they do the
same thing they've got like these big
barrels and I don't know maybe 40 50
different kinds of candy a lot of older
kind of candies but yeah it's like it
looks great people fill it up the
margins are incredible long shelf life
almost everybody loves a good candy
everyone's got a favorite in some way
and yeah it's just like kids love it
that once the kids's going crazy that
gives the that gives the parent the
excuse to also join in if they want to
yeah love it and you can take that same
model to yeah whether it's gym mining or
candy or whatever yeah I just I love
that gas station idea cuz the gas
station owner is probably buying Sour
Patch Kids for two bucks and selling it
for 289 like listen bro the kids are
going to prefer this because they get to
scoop it and they it's experiential and
then you're G to have an 80% margin
instead of a 20% margin right yeah and
for them like a gas station obviously
they're going to keep their existing
candy selection and yeah if somebody

[55:00]
candy selection and yeah if somebody
wants just the Snickers bar for I don't
know what they sell for now 99 Cents or
whatever okay you can do that or you can
go over here and probably pay a little
bit more but you know mix and match and
that's the value that they kind of
breaking up okay that that the value of
the experience mixing and matching
getting the exact quantity that you want
five different things yeah yeah yeah
yeah totally that's another for whatever
reason at snow if I'm going to be
working a station for whatever reason
it's usually the gift shop and man
that's another you'll have somebody come
up with just this monster bag of candy
and we we weigh it they can weigh it if
they want to along the way but no one
ever does but you know set it down and
then tell them the price and every time
I wince at what it's like okay this is
$89 of M&M's or whatever nine times out
of 10 that people pay it without even
question yeah and then every once in a
while when somebody gets upset by it or
whatever I I'll even say okay how about

[56:01]
whatever I I'll even say okay how about
$40 then and it's like we're still
making a great margin they get a huge
bag of candy and almost everybody almost
everybody finds a price to at least pay
if not at the price but yeah yeah yeah
they have no concept of how much things
weigh oh of course and that's something
too that me working in the gift shop
we've got we've got soft drinks and
we've got what I call Theater box candy
just the
prepackaged and I don't know maybe a box
of Sour Patch Kids let let's call it $4
which is expensive and maybe at the gas
station you buy that same box for $2 and
I've had a ton of people be like oh my
god4 I can buy this at the gas station
for two and then in a nice way I usually
say okay well you can do it and and they
aren't at a gas station so they pay it
or especially like with drinks and stuff
and they get it too it's like a it's a
tourist town you know it's same as the
movie theater and so anyways yeah
there's yeah I I just love those

[57:00]
there's yeah I I just love those
businesses or hustles or whatever that
have usually High margins very easy if
you make mistakes or you price something
wrong or you just didn't realize
something that there's a lot of room for
error on your part and yeah and making
doing a spin on something that is is
familiar with people like candy but
doing it your own way with lights and
weird gadgets and we've got all
different like stuff you've never seen
before like the hottest gummy bear and
all these SN like three feet long
exactly exactly and yeah yeah we had
those for a while and the problem with
those is yeah when somebody like when
somebody opens it or what you just got
this like $60 gummy snake laying around
that you can't really do anything with
and it's more for it's a gimmick we have
some of that stuff just as display yeah
yeah yeah but yeah no it's and it's just
fun like it's just a fun if you can get
over selling sugar to people that would

[58:01]
over selling sugar to people that would
be the only hurdle and other than that
yeah it's a fun it's a fun little
business and and we do same with toys we
sell a lot of toys and like the weirder
the more crazy the more unique the
better and yeah and so anyways it's a
fun Niche that I enjoy and want to build
into more businesses as I go forward
yeah I I'm thinking about the the gem
mining in the mall and I love I love
what you said about putting like real
prizes and 10% % of those or whatever
like a real diamond imagine if like I I
just picture if an 8-year-old kid is
mining for gems and a family walks by
they're not going to stop and watch and
then once they see the kid they're not
goingon to not bu so like imagine
manipulating it a little bit where
you're really busy they're a bunch of
kids and a kid checks out and you have a
bag of dirt that's like tagged and
you're like here you go try this one
that's the winning bag and then all the
kids see it like oh I'm going to get
that no 10% chance kids but I'll take
your money oh
totally I I didn't realize I have so
many principles to business but here's

[59:00]
many principles to business but here's
another one is I am really big on making
everything also a spectator kind of
event for snow and and the coaster too
like there are a lot of people whether
they just um aren't physically able or
or wanting to or whatever that just
watch and making that experience
something that's also good for them
because like for us and I promise this
is gonna loop back to the gold mine but
for us like if there's a family and they
brought grandma with them on vacation or
whatever you know if Grandma can't stand
for an hour to in line with you like
maybe you don't go to the coaster
because it's like we're not just going
to sit you know whatever and so you've
got to accommodate those kind of things
as well we at snow we've got these you
probably seen them in the mall but these
massage chairs where you put in a dollar
whatever and I was approached on those
and I was like okay whatever it was a
company gon to do like a REV share and I
was like

[1:00:00]
was like
whatever we got yeah yeah yeah and we
got some and they are probably the most
profitable thing that we have in terms
of a percentage like it is crazy because
again like it's Grandma or It's the dad
or whoever that's not participating but
you know it's their chance to do
something I guess and we've just keep
adding them and and the only problem
with that is it's a really unique well I
guess it's a really like a clever
product where if somebody sits down on
it and doesn't pay within 60 seconds or
whatever it starts beeping like this big
alarm or whatever to encourage them to
pay and so every once in a while you've
got some chaos with the beeping and
stuff but it's effective they most
people pay and we start at I don't know
two or three dollars and go all the way
up to $20 for those massages and it
freaking prints and so that ties back to
that's something that allows somebody
that might not be participating in the
main activity to still come and do
something that they enjoyed and watch

[1:01:01]
something that they enjoyed and watch
the others and like with the gym mining
too I would really really focus on like
how does this look from either somebody
in the group that might not be
participating or how does this look from
somebody walking like the mall somebody
just walking and how do you get their
attention and and you said this like
friction like how do you reduce the
friction and allow them to participate
as easily as possible like maybe that's
even you've got like some free bags or
something and they're smaller whatever
and you hook them in with that and
upsell just something to yeah to to get
them to participate and yeah make it
like a maybe not a show but an
experience yeah well I just interviewed
the owner of dig world that guy who has
the yeah I'm so excited to hear that
it's coming out in a week or two but he
does the same thing I'm like how is it
only $25 for two hours and he's like
well it's like that includes the grandma
that's just watching I'm like yeah and
then Grandma us gets on the back as well
right so that's exactly what you're

[1:02:00]
right so that's exactly what you're
talking about I was thinking with the
massage chairs you should reprogram the
beeps to just yell like poor poor poor
they're not paying they're not paying
that's funny um you know it's it's
something that when my rev share when
when that lease or whatever started
getting close to expiring I was like
okay well I'm just gonna I'm just gonna
go buy my own yeah yeah yeah and I told
that I was like hey look like I I feel
bad about this but like I'm G to do this
and I appreciate it and they were like
they gave me some stat like we were like
the number three vendor for them they
had a lot of locations or put them in a
lot of locations and anyways they cut my
rev share down to I think it's like 8020
they rather have something nothing yeah
they Supply like new cushions if
something breaks but I was like fine
okay we'll keep going for a while but oh
yeah what I was going to say about the
the Dig world I'm sure you saw this um
in Pigeon Forge we just got Diggin Zone
it's same thing but it's an independent
brand or whatever did you see that no I

[1:03:00]
brand or whatever did you see that no I
want to like I want to do a whole other
podcast with you about that if you don't
mind yeah yeah yeah so what I was gonna
say is one reason I'm really excited to
hear yours that you just did was a you
know I know ideas are are diamond dozen
but I've been thinking about doing that
forever I just never did well you're the
guy to do it too I mean this right up
your alley I know I know but so here's
the thing the one here
is in what I would say a terrible
location I could be wrong but I I think
it's a terrible location you need a lot
of land and land is at a premium and so
they are off the beaten path so they
have to be a destination for the most
part so in what you save by not being in
a premium real estate like whatever that
would cost you're paying it every year
in marketing you got to get people there
but anyways they I watch them very
closely they it appears that they might
have ran out of money a couple times as
they were building it and they finally

[1:04:01]
they were building it and they finally
got open and there's a huge Buzz around
it on social media and everything and so
I was really excited to see okay what do
you get and they sell a all day pass and
don't quote me on this but I think
adults for the day it's like $70
something like that every person has to
pay to enter Grandma's paying $70 holy
cow yeah I think there's a little bit of
a discount for senior citizens or kids
whatever but I don't pass that way in
town when I'm up there super super often
I think they've got some business I'll
be very interested to see like I mean
they're able to do it for 60 or $ 70 off
the beaten path and like when you really
look at it like I don't know a lot of
the rides are like you could Jazz them
up quite a bit they've got the tracko or
whatever that four people sit and goes
like that I don't know you can
definitely Jazz that up but and you can
definitely I think go cheaper depending
on how you pay for the equipment but
anyways I've been super interested in
that I still am thinking about maybe

[1:05:02]
that I still am thinking about maybe
doing one in a better location put my
own spin on it people love digging and
moving thing all that kind of stuff with
heavy equipment and at theirs from what
I've seen they've got a little sandbox
or whatever but what if you could like
really dig some holes like in a safe way
and really fill and and push dirt and do
some fun stuff it just you
oh oh totally so I will be very excited
to hear how what you said $1 an hour 14
something like it's $25 for two hours
per person okay that's not bad that
that's not bad at all and yeah I I'll be
very excited about that because it's
been on my mind a lot yeah and he's only
on three
acres 50,000 customers a
year oh no way what city ktie Texas it's
right next to the the mall there it's
like in the mall parking lot so he
leases Land from the mall oh no wayant

[1:06:00]
leases Land from the mall oh no wayant
and going back to malls I'm so glad you
brought that up I have thought so so
here in Knoxville we've got a couple
malls but the main one's called Westtown
mall and it's got a Cheesecake Factory
that tells you like it's not big but
it's also it's got movie theater all
that kind of stuff but your parking lot
is humongous and they a couple times a
year I don't know if this is common in
other places but they'll lease it out to
a circus or whatever it is and they'll
have a popup event for a month or
something I think it does well but I
thought about doing something very
similar with a snow concept and leasing
a space like that that has high traffic
that has a lot of area do it seasonally
it's it's a whole lot easier to maintain
snow in November December January than
it is July and yeah do do a popup snow
event I have no idea I have no idea what
you know leasing a mall parking lot
would look like but people do it so I
think there's something there but yeah I
I think about malls a lot I never go but

[1:07:00]
I think about malls a lot I never go but
yeah like it's just they're really just
unique in a weird just perfectly
American kind of invention yeah but yeah
that's just so funny yeah especially in
Houston like being indoors to shop is
that's always going to be popular right
in certain markets of course yeah well
yeah yeah yeah and well that's something
too like I I assume you're saying that
Texas I'm sure gets very hot and whether
it's extreme heat heat or it's cold or
it's snow or whatever people might say
they enjoy that they enjoy being outside
they enjoy being in the sun but most
people they enjoy small segments of that
and so we'll have a lot of people that
come from up North and and have snow all
the time and they are excited to be at
our place because it's a controlled
environment they've never been in snow
in 70 degrees it makes it just so
accessible in a way that you know and so
like same thing like shopping if it's
Houston in the summer yeah you might
enjoy outside sometimes but yeah people
are lazy and want to be comfortable and

[1:08:02]
are lazy and want to be comfortable and
yeah like being indoors or just yeah I
guess I guess what I'm going with it is
just like
bringing it's not to cater to the
laziness of the customer but it's just
making them reducing the friction just
like you said yeah well dude like I'm I
feel like we only scratched the surface
of what I want to talk to you about like
I would love to have you on again if you
don't mind yeah oh I would I think this
is gonna be really popular because it
was just chalk full of
ideas I I hope so I don't care that much
necessarily about having uh a following
but I just like talking shop I guess and
one thing that's hard for me in terms of
I'm traditionally been very bad on
self-promotion but I can't really sum up
what it is that I do and like you can do
a deep dive whether it's I mean there's
plenty of projects and businesses we we
didn't even mention and it's just
something that it's hard to package it
and we talk for whatever an hour and

[1:09:02]
and we talk for whatever an hour and
yeah like I could seriously go another
few hours with you and it's just a hard
thing to explain so anyways having a uh
having multiple sessions I think would
be awesome yeah okay well let's do it
I'm headed to Greece in a couple days oh
cool and then Utah but I'm bringing my
recording stuff to Utah so maybe in a
two or three weeks yeah sure yeah just
let me know with uh with a little bit
heads up I can make anything work really
for the most part so yeah just let me
know what works for you okay awesome man
well like this was a lot of fun I feel
like you're we're Kindred Spirits
appreciate it I agree I agree you posted
that picture of something you're
building and I want to get to that and I
want to talk more about snow and okay I
just I I feel like you're doing like 80%
more than what we got had time for today
so oh totally so yeah no I'll I'll get
some topics together too but yeah just
whatever you think of and yeah if you
want to do a shorter session longer
session whatever just let me know I'm
pretty flexible cool all right well
