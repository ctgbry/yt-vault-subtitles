would you look at this freaking guy
right here this is the most genius
marketing hack I've heard of this year
day 59 of Genius business ideas follow
for more and it reminds me of this guy
right here who put flyers up all around
the city with a QR code and a message
that said I know what you did when you
scann the QR code it led to his
Instagram page here's how you can use
this hack to make more money so this guy
printed fake parking tickets with a QR
code to advertise his music he did this
to a thousand cars in the state of New
Jersey and suddenly New Jersey was his
number one market so this would work
much much better with something higher
ticket cuz music is about as low ticket
as you can get but if if you have a
product or service worth any more
than100 or $1,000 you could print with
this strategy get the full business plan
