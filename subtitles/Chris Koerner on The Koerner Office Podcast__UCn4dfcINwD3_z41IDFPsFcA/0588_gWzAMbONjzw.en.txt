look at this freaking idea right here I
always love ideas more if I can pair it
with a genius marketing idea day 54 of
Genius business ideas follow for more
this guy charges $400 to rent out this
trailer where you can shoot hoops if I
were him I'd go to the park or the mall
and let kids play with this thing for
free so the parents can Wander over and
say oh what is this what is this
business thanks for letting my kid play
we rent this out to birthday parties and
school events how many leads are you
going to get from that or this other guy
behind me has a much more janky version
of this that probably costs a fraction
of the amount to build out but he
probably charges still about $300 per
rental anything that gets kids outside
is blowing up right now full business
plan right here
