look at this freaking lady right here
what a brilliant business idea she just
gave me that I want you to copy she went
online and bought these $300 meta Quest
augmented reality goggles then she has
chat GPT generate a funky looking image
she displays the image on the pavement
with her goggles and draws inside the
lines you can monetize this in at least
two different ways before I tell you
those ways here's why this would work as
consumers we don't hate marketing or ads
we hate ugly marketing and ads why do
you think everyone watches the Super
Bowl just for the commercials cuz
they're good they're Artful they're
entertaining so if you're walking down
the road and you see some eye-catching
artwork that literally stops you in your
tracks you're going to be more likely to
buy the product or service that's being
advertised in the artwork here's how you
monetize this let's say you own a
pressure washing business go to chat GPT
and have it generate a few images for
you display it with your goggles and
start filling in the lines yes I'm
oversimplifying cuz if I didn't you
would never start anything go find
somewhere with a ton of foot traffic
outdoor shopping parking lot of a mall
get creative put some art down there
with your phone number and big bold
letters number two any company out there
could benefit from marketing like this
to sell their product or service so you
can even make some artwork that
advertises your artwork $500 to $3,000

advertises your artwork $500 to $3,000
to draw this on behalf of another
company so they can use this Creative
Marketing as well full business plan
