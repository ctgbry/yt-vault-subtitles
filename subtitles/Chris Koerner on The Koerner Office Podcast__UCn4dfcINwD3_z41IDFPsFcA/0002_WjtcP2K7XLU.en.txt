setting up websites for um for small
businesses so I'm to start off I've kind
of niched down to real estate agents um
I got a list of a bunch of Agents from
realtor.com who don't have websites so I
can cold email them um with with an
offer to make a website for them for I'm
starting off with like two grand um but
I I don't know if this is if it's just
totally unfounded I don't have a ton of
data that I'm going off of and so I keep
kind of getting this
like um I don't know like heavy doubts
with it um or I don't know if it'll if
if if I can validate kind of what I'm
doing as I'm going through or if I'm
wasting my time in certain areas so I'd
love kind of like an audit of just where
I could be improving just the general
business process and what I shouldn't be
worrying about okay um so your general
idea is to make custom web we sites for

[01:00]
idea is to make custom web we sites for
real estate agents that don't have a
website right yeah okay and is this
still in the ideation phase or do you
have a customer yet uh yeah still in the
ideation phase um I just sent out my
first like cold email um yesterday with
a quick little um you know hey we could
make a I could make a website for you
and I attached a uh a screenshot of what
it would look like with like their face
their name and um and the area that they
cover with their real estate to kind of
see if that would work so so just very
early stages have you thought of trying
a different approach and going after
real estate agents that already have a
website that might be unoptimized or
just for lack of a better word crappy
and and like pitching to them why their
website needs to be improved or should
be improved and what they could get from
a more optimized website because I don't
like the idea of finding realtors that
don't have websites because a there's a

[02:02]
don't have websites because a there's a
good chance they don't have a website
because they are an inactive agent and
like you scrape their data and it's six
months or six years old or somewhere in
between and so they don't want a website
they don't even want to do anything with
real estate um I also don't like it
because it could be the opposite end of
the spectrum and you've got this small
town agent that just crushes it and I
don't need a website I do
just they're right you know like they
could do much better if they had a
website but it's not your job to
convince them of that because you
probably won't right right and so I'm
thinking if you if you use builtwith to
let's say let's say you use builtwith to
scrape all of the websites that have a
certain WordPress plug-in right like
maybe you know what idx
is um
the the coding platform yeah idx is is

[03:01]
the the coding platform yeah idx is is
like the API for for Real Estate right
where it's like you link your MLS to
your website so you go to Stacy
realtor.com and you can you know you can
view houses not just her listings but
like it's it's just like an API that
pulls from the local MLS like Zilla does
oh that's awesome Nationwide so I I
imagine I assume that WordPress has a
plugin for idx uh so therefore they have
to there's a million WordPress plugins
if you find plugin that supports idx and
then use built with to export the
100,000 plus websites that used that
plugin then you can infer that those
WordPress websites are realtor websites
because they're using the idx plugin so
now you know that all of these people
have WordPress websites that are real
estate websites that are probably they
probably look really bad and or they
probably don't convert well or and or
they're probably outdated and so then

[04:00]
they're probably outdated and so then
you could use those people and go find
like what was their website called like
grasshopper or carrot or something like
there's a half a dozen SAS platforms out
there that will basically make uh Real
Estate websites that look really really
good um and you don't need to reinvent
the wheel you can still charge $22,000 I
know people that use card templates and
charge $2,000 and it takes them 30
minutes to set up a site right like you
don't have to make this custom you could
just piggyback off of some overfunded
Silicon Valley real estate website
startup I love that and just yeah
exactly and just say hey and you don't
even need to have a customer first you
could just point to other Real Estate
websites that are using that same
platform and say hey Stacy I see you're
on WordPress good for you for having a
website because it's surprising how many
Realtors don't so you're G to kind of
compliment them but like did you you
know that a website that has X Y and Z

[05:02]
know that a website that has X Y and Z
features results in 36% more leads to
real estate agents and it doesn't cost
any more than WordPress um so it's like
they want to know
immediately how can a better website
actually lead to more money in their
pocket right because you don't want to
you don't want to sell them oh your
website's ugly I'll make it look better
this will lead to more money in your
pocket um and you pointing to other
sites they're using that same platform
the implication is that these are case
studies these are your old customers but
no you're just showing them examples
right I love that yeah you can pull
stats off of the platform's website like
the 36% or whatever it is because I'm
sure they have those stats and just
piggyback on those stats um you can
build your own website with that
platform even though you're not a
realter and then you can go after people
that are already sold on having a
website they know it's important it a

[06:01]
website they know it's important it a
website is one of those things where
it's been outdated forever you know it's
outdated and you know you need to fix it
you know you should fix it but you're
not going to until you get a cold email
you know like something has to be
impetus for you to do that and so you
could be that cold email you can still
charge what you want it doesn't have to
be custom you can you can copy and paste
all these websites literally like you do
on call on card and then swap out the
city and the
name sweet okay I love this this is a
fantastic I feel like this is the kind
of that last key in place to really make
this work I love this good yeah I think
uh I think this would work and honestly
you can you can text them as well um
there's the good and bad about selling
to Realtors I've done it my wife is one
uh the good is that you can get their
info super easily the bad is that
because of that everyone is pitching to
them
non-stop but there is more good than bad
because

[07:00]
because
of all the people you're going to cold
call they are the most likely to answer
their phone um it could be a
listing so that's what I would do okay
thank you I feel like I've got some good
direction here absolutely good luck
