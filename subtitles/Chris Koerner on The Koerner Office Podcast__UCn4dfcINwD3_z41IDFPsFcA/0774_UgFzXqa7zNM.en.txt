[00:00]
What if I told you there was treasure in
this trash? Well, as luck would have it,
my friend Spencer started a trash
business with almost no money that does
$50,000 a month. And so, I bought the
truck, started making payments on it,
never took a dollar out of my pocket.
How much revenue does this one truck
generate? 9* 800 would be your number. I
still can't get over that WY Texas would
be $10 million a year on the two trucks.
$210,000 a month. That's gross 40%
margin. It's one of the magic things
about what you're doing is you're not
only getting 100% financing for these
trucks, but you're buying them for like
70% discount.
&gt;&gt; So, we've never had a customer
cancelled. Oh my gosh. So, today we're
going to break down how he finds
customers, how he finds contracts with
both neighborhoods and cities, and how
he finances trucks like this for almost
no money down. So, let's get going.
&gt;&gt; All right. So, you're a software guy.
How do you go from software to trash?
&gt;&gt; I think trash is software, right?
Subscription based,
&gt;&gt; I guess. So
&gt;&gt; that's basically the thought process. So
I have one or two s well technically two
software companies and when this just

[01:00]
software companies and when this just
popped up it felt like it landed in my
lap. I think you would think the same
thing. Neighborhood doesn't trash
doesn't get picked up. There's 400
houses in here. You know the Chris
Cornered brain goes hm 400 houses $35 to
$60 a month
&gt;&gt; 12,000 a month.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It gets out of control quickly and
you're like I wonder how hard it would
be to get people to sign up. I don't
think my bl brain ever flipped over to
like, do I want to do this? It was more
like, let's just see if it's possible
first.
&gt;&gt; Well, how hard is it to just post
something to Facebook,
&gt;&gt; right? That's exactly right. So, I was
like, how can I make this like a
no-brainer, which stole that from
Hermosi, which was like, all right,
everyone, the common sentiment is
everyone hates the existing trash
company.
&gt;&gt; Why did they hate it?
&gt;&gt; So, it sold to private equity, expenses
got cut. I'm assuming some drivers quit,
&gt;&gt; but like the customer support was
miserable. Um and so people just started
quitting in droves and in our
neighborhood um something happened where
people just they didn't pick up the
trash like a week or two and people were
ir rate and so we

[02:00]
ir rate and so we
&gt;&gt; that's all it took was a week or two.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. I think it was more than
that. So it was week or two didn't get
picked up and then there were emails
coming out that the billing was
changing. People were getting double
bill in the handoff from one company to
the other. And then I think the nail in
the coffin was they said, "We're not
picking up anything outside of the
bins." And depending on where you're at
watching this video, you can see why
that would be, right? You just don't
want to have to get out, right? The
effectiveness and the scalability of
this truck in particular is being able
to use that claw and tip it without
having to get out.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And when you have to get out, it crushes
you in this truck times two. Because in
a normal truck, you toss it in the back,
you keep moving. And this one you got to
come up with creative ways to load it
nine feet.
&gt;&gt; It could be the difference between
servicing 400 homes in a day and 100.
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's it. You nailed it. So,
basically with this truck, you can do 15
seconds a house. If you're doing a rear
loader, it can get up to a minute.
&gt;&gt; And so, like if you just times that by
drive time and then 400 houses, it gets
out of control quickly. So, anyways, we

[03:00]
out of control quickly. So, anyways, we
got uh
&gt;&gt; So, you go to Facebook,
&gt;&gt; go to Facebook and I'm trying to put an
offer up and the offer that I wanted to
put up was supposed to be no-brainer.
And I'm like, listen, they're going to
service this neighborhood no matter
what. So, the first part of my offer was
like, hey, I'm gonna if I can get 200
customers to sign up, there's 400 people
who live in here. I figured, hey, if I
could get half of them, that would be
huge.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; If I get half of them, that'd be huge.
And if you don't if we don't hit that
number, 100% refund. There's no risk.
Like, you either get your trash pickup
or you get your money back.
&gt;&gt; And that's somewhat risky to you because
if you refund everyone, Stripe or
whoever will keep all the
&gt;&gt; refunds,
but it's it's a small risk.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It was a percentage risk
basically. So now to counteract that,
I'm glad you said that because that's
something most people don't catch.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; We put in Stripe, you can extend the
escrow before the money gets transferred
to you. So we extended it as far as it
would go
&gt;&gt; to mitigate that risk.
&gt;&gt; Mitigate it. So before they transfer it
to your bank account, they uh ask you
like how long do you want us, you know,
you can have it same day or you can have
it and you pay more money. Anyways, um

[04:01]
it and you pay more money. Anyways, um
so to mitigate the risk, we kept in an
escrow as long as we could and we ended
up getting I think in 15 days something
like 150 people and then ended up
getting like in the first year about
200.
&gt;&gt; Oh my gosh. So, you hit your goal.
&gt;&gt; Yep. So, we hit the goal. I didn't have
to refund everyone. That was part of the
offer. It was like, hey, if we don't hit
the goal, I'll refund you all the money.
No risk. And then if we do hit the goal,
we're going to use the cash to go buy a
trash trash truck. Now, we did ask for 3
months in advance.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, And so $105. So we we got
basically 200 or 200 people to send us
$105. Now that was over probably 45day
period for the 200. We got the initial
150 in like 10 15 days.
&gt;&gt; So that's like 15,000 bucks. Yeah. In
like pre-sales.
&gt;&gt; 15,000 in pre-sales. And if you really
look at it, it's like five grand a month
in reoccurring.
&gt;&gt; What's crazy is like you were like
totally transparent with them. I've
never owned a trash business. I don't
have a trash business. I know that these
guys suck. I could do it better. How
hard could it be? Most people would be

[05:00]
hard could it be? Most people would be
tempted to be like, "Listen, my brother
has a trash business. You know, I know
what I'm doing." But you were like,
"Hey, all the cards on the table." But
you made it risk- free for them. That's
what offset the lack of experience,
right?
&gt;&gt; I think deep down I've always wanted to
do a pre-sale. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And so like this was like you always
hear people talking about like Noah
Kagan is a big one. I'm like, "Oh, do
pre-sale." And I was like, "You know
what? Let's try it." So I think the
initial thing was like, "Can I make this
work?"
&gt;&gt; But people don't do pre-sales for
garbage businesses. Like that's what I
love. I love taking like software
concepts and putting it in a sweaty
business,
&gt;&gt; right? And so part of me wasn't even
like thinking about the trash aspect at
all. And then I was like, "Okay, let's
do this." I think the first day it was
like thousands of dollars and I started
to my pants a little bit. And then
at one point we had, like I said, 15 I
think when we hit 150, which my goal was
200. I turned to my wife, I'm like,
"Dude, we got $15,000 and we've got to
decide." And this window, I think it was
like 60-day window, it's going to get
put into our bank account. Yeah. And

[06:00]
put into our bank account. Yeah. And
then if that happens, the refund fees
get hit because you're now you're doing
a double trans% and they charge a fee,
&gt;&gt; right? Unless you kept it in the escrow,
right? So then you can send it out.
&gt;&gt; I didn't even know that. That's that's
clutch.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Um and so I was like, you know,
what do we do? So then I started
googling how to buy, you know, where to
buy trash truck and all sorts of stuff.
Yeah. But yeah, that's how we started.
&gt;&gt; All right, Spencer. So, how do you go
from 15,000 in pre-sales to actually
fulfilling on this service?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think it started with like
googling garbage trucks for sale.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; And then I ended up basically seeing
like everything was so expensive and
then I wanted to start asking people for
help. So, I went on to Facebook
Marketplace, typed in garbage truck.
There was a bunch of garbage trucks on
Facebook Marketplace and here's what I
learned. Anyone who's selling a garbage
truck owns a trash company. So, I end up
having conversations with these guys who
are selling garbage trucks
&gt;&gt; and I start saying like, "Well, where do
I buy these at?"
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Where do you buy them at? And one of the
guys goes, "Well, why don't you join the

[07:00]
guys goes, "Well, why don't you join the
mom and pop trash group?" And I'm like,
"Never heard of that. That didn't pop up
in the search. What a weird name."
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's for operators.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, for operators. And so, look, it
So, I joined that. And he goes, "If I
were you, I one of my recommendations
would be to be to buy a side loader. You
don't have to run two trucks or two
employees. Side loaders will robot arm
grabs it and tips it. And his words, not
mine, were if you can buy a side loader
that's under CDL, that's the holy grail
truck.
&gt;&gt; CDL means you need a special license.
&gt;&gt; CDL means you special license and
special license means you get paid more.
&gt;&gt; So holy grail truck is you only need one
employee or no employees and you don't
need a special license. You could be
operating tomorrow,
&gt;&gt; right? Okay. And so, coincidentally, one
popped up on Facebook group by this guy
in Tucson, Arizona, who I think bought
later on, I learned, bought it at an
auction house from the city. So, he was
flipping it.
&gt;&gt; He didn't tell me that, but yeah, he was
flipping it.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; So, anyways, I bought it sight unseen
and he just sent me videos and we agreed
to a price.
&gt;&gt; What was the price?
&gt;&gt; Uh, it was 35,000.

[08:01]
&gt;&gt; Uh, it was 35,000.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Uh, and then ended up being 5,000 in
shipping. We agreed to a price, I said,
"This is going to be crazy." I was like,
"But can I send you half now, half
later, because I don't know anything. I
don't know you. I didn't see the truck.
Like, I don't know anything about this."
He goes, "No problem." Which made me
trust him more.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; He goes, "I never done a deal like
this." I'm like, "I've never bought a
garbage truck." So, we're in this
together. And so, anyways, we bought it.
I sent him the wire. He sends me of a
picture of it being loaded onto a uh
shipping truck, logistics truck, and I
had it shipped here. It was about 5
grand. We ran it for 40, and I 100%
financed it. That's the fun part. So,
from software, I opened an AMX. I'm
like, let's get those points. Let's get
those flights. And uh AMX sent me an
email for like just being a good
customer. And it said, hey, do you want
$40,000 in personal loan? They like just
send that email. I And I was getting it
like every month. And I was like, I what
am I going to do with this? And then the
opportunity was there. So, I clicked

[09:01]
opportunity was there. So, I clicked
accept thinking I was going to get a
call from like uh you know approval and
you know financials and all this stuff.
The money just got put in my account.
&gt;&gt; Literally one click in like 3 hours I
had 40 grand in my bank account and I
was like I think it was actually 30
grand cuz I that was the price of the
truck and then I ended up having to pay
five for the shipping and so I bought it
and the payment it was good terms of 7%
and it's not tied to the equipment.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So they can't take it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I can't take it. And so it's tied
to me personally, which kind of sucks,
but it's $700 a month payment. And since
it's tied to me instead of the truck,
it's like 6% interest. 7% interest. 7%
interest 10 years. It's like the
greatest loan ever.
&gt;&gt; So you make you one payment in a day's
worth of work.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Less than a day.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And so we were making five grand a
month at the time doing one day a week,
four days a month. And I'm like, $700?
Like we can afford this. And so I bought
the truck and started making payments on
it. Never took a dollar out of my
pocket. So when it rolls off the
flatbed, like I mean, how do they get it

[10:00]
flatbed, like I mean, how do they get it
here?
&gt;&gt; That's another story that we can go
into. There's logistics companies that
sell you the last mile.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So there was a guy in Tucson who was
coming back to Dallas and had no route.
They call it empty route.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Empty.
&gt;&gt; And I called a broker and the broker's
like, I got three empty leg guys. Guy
picks it up, takes it to like a, you
know, trucky yard. I had to go meet him
over in WY and we just drove it off the
trailer, which is another problem. from
the battery. They left the lights on
from Tucson to here, so the battery was
dead.
&gt;&gt; How did you learn how to operate this
thing?
&gt;&gt; Well, it's 100 CDL truck. I mean, I
didn't basically the guy gets here and I
go, "Can you show me how to drive this?"
He goes, "What do you mean?" I was like,
"I've never drove anything like this."
He goes, "What do you mean? You just
bought a I was like, "I I peasant."
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm saying, idiot.
&gt;&gt; Can you show me how this works? And he
showed me how to drive it in this
trucker who delivered it here.
&gt;&gt; This guy who has no business showing you
how to drive it. He's not obligated.
paid just to deliver it is showing me
how to drive it in the parking lot of
the trucking center. And then I had I
got it to my house, which was parked

[11:00]
got it to my house, which was parked
right there. I had to figure out how to
work the arm because there's no guide to
that. And the truck, by the way, is a
2006 with 200,000 mi. And so anyone
who's in the trash industry is like,
"Oh, I've never touched that. You're
crazy." I'm like, "I don't know this
stuff."
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Like
&gt;&gt; that can be a feature though. That can
be not
&gt;&gt; like I don't know what you're talking
about. like that's a high-risisk truck
or that's a lot of miles or
&gt;&gt; that's a good framework to touch on cuz
if if you would have like done this
market research which a lot of people
do. They do that to feel good. Let's go
talk to a few business owners. They
would say, "Dude, get out. Get out of
the business. It's hard. Your guys won't
show up for work. Don't buy anything.
&gt;&gt; You're going to go through tires. That
truck's going to break. You're going to
be stranded.
&gt;&gt; I'm telling you, sometimes the people in
the industry are the worst people to
talk to. Ignorance can be bliss. Naity
can be a superpower."
&gt;&gt; 100%. Now, if you paid 35, what was it
worth on day one?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I think I could have sold it for
like 60.
&gt;&gt; Wow.
&gt;&gt; And I I think he bought it for like 10
or 15 at the auction. It is an old
truck.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But any under CDL truck that has an

[12:00]
&gt;&gt; But any under CDL truck that has an
automated automatic arm,
&gt;&gt; people kill for those.
&gt;&gt; And you're still running that.
&gt;&gt; It's still running. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; A year and a half later,
&gt;&gt; we passed it in the video in the video.
&gt;&gt; How many miles are on it today after 18
months?
&gt;&gt; 215 probably. And it's uh you know, we
keep up with the maintenance, do the oil
changes. I think the engine's strong. I
think the hydraulic the like trash
compactor part will fail before the
engine does.
&gt;&gt; All right. So, tell me about these bins.
How'd you get your hands on these bins?
&gt;&gt; So, we had to get bins in like less than
30 days. And what's Dude, if you Google
like buy trash cans, it doesn't like
Home Depot pops up.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, like it's really hard to find.
They're called polycarts, Chris.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; So, Facebook group will tell you kind of
what to call them. did some Google
searching and stumbled across a company
called Cascade in Michigan that makes
bins for everyone. Okay. And so we
called them and I was like, I need it in
less than 30 days. She said, not
possible. Not for us. Maybe somebody
else said, where can I get them? She
goes, there's this company called BNG
Sales in Grand Rapids that buys used
trash bins as like liquidation. Like

[13:01]
trash bins as like liquidation. Like
trash company sells. They don't want the
branding anymore. And so they had an
inventory of like I think 500 used bins
and I bought 200 of them and I want to
say they were it was all in for like 10
grand. I think it was 10 grand with the
shipping and then during December like
the 24th like the day before Christmas
and like 2 days before there are 200
used trash bins in my driveway with a
wall of trash bins and they were not
clean. Like it was like they took them
and some of them saw trash in them. They
delivered them and they delivered them
to my house and we unloaded them in my
driveway
&gt;&gt; and 200 trash bins is way more trash
bins than you think it is. Like the
whole driveway is full and most of the
neighborhood was fine with it cuz they
knew what I was doing from the Facebook.
And then each day for like a week I
would pull out like 20 of them and power
wash them in the driveway. And something
that I didn't calculate was like I had
to rebrand them. So we ordered them.
They didn't get here in time and I

[14:00]
They didn't get here in time and I
couldn't wait. So I put out bins with
someone else's name on it
&gt;&gt; in from Tucson, Arizona.
&gt;&gt; And everyone who had signed up like knew
what was happening. So they did not care
at all.
&gt;&gt; Well, you built a community like
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. They were part of they were
invested in the story. Yeah. And uh so
what I ended up doing was the stickers
got here. I put them in the garbage
truck and each day I would at once a
week sticker the bins until we had them
all stickered. Yeah. I think the whole
all-in startup cost you're like, you
know, finance a truck at 700 bucks. The
bins were 10 grand. So, that was that
was where I probably made a mistake. I
probably could have financed the bins or
took some of that cash,
&gt;&gt; put them on a credit card.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Put them on a credit card. I could
have done that better.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Uh because what we ended up doing was
like cleaning out the 15K or like 10,000
of the 15,000 quickly.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But really, if you consider the
$15,000 in pre-orders, you're you're
like cash flow positive even after you
buy the bins.
&gt;&gt; Correct. Yeah. Yeah. Correct. Oh my god.
&gt;&gt; And so we had some cash left over which
covered the dump fees for the 3 months
in the gas.
&gt;&gt; So arguably, if I'm trying to clickbait

[15:00]
&gt;&gt; So arguably, if I'm trying to clickbait
you, there was no cash out of pocket.
&gt;&gt; And then it just, you know, word of
mouth grew from there. We rolled out a
referral program. People were like
invested in the story, which I think is
like one of the harder things to keep
going. So like, if I could have everyone
in Texas sign up based on the story, I
think we would landslide everyone. Now
we've reached a point of scale where
like they're like like oh I just saw a
random bin on the side of the road to
sign up and they have no clue who I am
or who the story is or
&gt;&gt; just reach the story got you to that
point
&gt;&gt; right and I I wish that like I did a
better job or if there is a better way
to like get people to sign up from the
story
&gt;&gt; cuz I think people buy from people they
like and if it's this or that the story
might get people to sign up but here's
what I'll also say no one is signing up
for our trash service because they're
like that's outside of the story they're
like that's Spencer kid in those
reviews. You know why they switch is
because they get pissed at their vendor.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I can't win business just to win
business. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You have to mess up for me to win the
business.
&gt;&gt; But luckily, a lot of people are messing
up,
&gt;&gt; right? People aren't just The big common
misconception is like you could name

[16:01]
misconception is like you could name
this whatever and just be there when
somebody messes up and you'll get the
business.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's timing.
&gt;&gt; That's what I've learned. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Just have a couple reviews, have some
neighborhood word of mouth. But the
reviews and neighborhood word of mouth
isn't enough to get somebody to switch.
It's just not. And that that's something
that you have to wait for them to mess
up and then be there.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, these videos take a lot of time
and cost a lot of money to film. So, if
you want to say thanks, just hit
subscribe, please. You might think
you're subscribed to me, but about 2/3
of my viewers are not subscribed. Hit
subscribe. It would mean the world.
Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Okay, so pre-sales are cool. Getting all
this money up front is cool. How do you
sustain the business once you exhaust
this neighborhood?
&gt;&gt; So, referrals is the first like key
thing that we leaned on.
&gt;&gt; You ask for them.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. and we rewarded them. Yeah.
So, I would say like a secret, not not
the actually maybe the secret is
referrals because as we might have
mentioned before, people won't just sign
up because they like you. Yeah. So, if
your neighbor tells you that your trash
company is awesome and they start
bragging on you like, "Oh, dude, they

[17:00]
bragging on you like, "Oh, dude, they
send me these jokes. They're really
great company." That helps and somebody
will switch for that. So, we created a
referral system that gave someone a free
month of trash every single time they
refer a neighbor.
&gt;&gt; Okay? All they have to do is put their
name in and we'll put a credit on their
account. Yeah. And they So, we've had
somebody refer up to 16 houses before
and got a whole year's worth of trash,
&gt;&gt; which is crazy. So, like that's the
best, right? Cuz I don't have to pay for
that.
&gt;&gt; I'm paying what 35 bucks, but then my
margin is cooked into that. So, like,
you know, it's it's the best way to get
business.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. All right. So, Facebook ads.
&gt;&gt; So, Facebook ads basically, uh, I met a
kid who was doing 50 grand a month power
washing trash cans. Okay.
&gt;&gt; And he was like 26, 27. And I'm like
&gt;&gt; like one of those bin cleaning.
&gt;&gt; Yes. The can man. His name's Kade. And
uh I called Kade and I'm like, "Dude,
and I just wanted to talk to him because
I saw his stickers were on my bins.
Remember how they arrived dirty?" I put
some of them out dirty. So people hired
him to come clean them.
&gt;&gt; So now I'm seeing his stickers on my
stuff. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So I call him and uh

[18:01]
&gt;&gt; So I call him and uh
&gt;&gt; just kid normal conversation and then
you know start asking him about his
business and stuff and he kind of leaks
to me that he's doing really good. And
I'm like what? How? Like this is such a
commod like you could be defeated by a
$50 power washer. Like
&gt;&gt; and it's such a low ticket.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And like I told you it's hard to
get people to switch to my stuff.
Imagine that.
&gt;&gt; And so anyways, he goes, "Facebook ads."
And I'm like, "What do you mean Facebook
ads?" He's like, "Dude," he's like, "We
put out Facebook ads. People sign up and
we've got it. The unic economics work."
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And I'm like, "No, dude. I did Facebook
ads. They don't work." Yeah. You know,
&gt;&gt; and I've heard that so many times. Oh, I
tried Google ads. Doesn't work.
&gt;&gt; It doesn't work. I I spent money. And he
goes, "You didn't set them up right."
And I was like, "Okay, what what do I
do? Teach me." Uh, and he goes, "All
right." He goes, "It has to the
algorithm has to learn who your ideal
customer is. And most people never spend
that number to teach the algorithm." And
that sounds sounded crazy.
&gt;&gt; Too soon.
&gt;&gt; Sounded crazy to me. And you have to set
it up right. He goes, "So, here's what I
want you to do, Spencer." He's like, he

[19:00]
want you to do, Spencer." He's like, he
gave me a guy on Fiverr that just was
like responsible for installing the
Google Pixel,
&gt;&gt; which I'm a software guy. That should be
easy. But part of it was having a
success page. So we'd send them to
Stripe to check out
&gt;&gt; to track the conversion,
&gt;&gt; right? Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Right. That's the big thing. So you send
them to Stripe to check out.
&gt;&gt; It wasn't optimizing for conversions.
Was optimizing for
&gt;&gt; It was just spending my money. It gave
me what I wanted. It gave me what I what
I wanted. So he puts in a success page
that tracks the conversion through
Stripe. So they would leave our website,
but when they get back, they hit the
success page. It tells Facebook that
they're doing a good job. Now it comes
down to getting enough of those people
in the system. So what we ended up data
point
&gt;&gt; So yeah. So what Kade said was I need to
spend $300 a day for like five days or a
week.
&gt;&gt; And for a cheapo like me,
&gt;&gt; dude. Yeah. Yeah. I'm like counting my
my shillings.
&gt;&gt; I'm like I don't know if I can do this.
So
&gt;&gt; cuz you're thinking I need to get 10
customers for that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But you're not you're not going to
get that.
&gt;&gt; No, you're you're going to get your face

[20:00]
&gt;&gt; No, you're you're going to get your face
kicked basically is what happened. And
so that's kind of what happened. So, we
started getting our face kicked in a
little bit and I'm dying every day. It's
like watching like a slot machine just
take your money and I'm like going,
"No."
&gt;&gt; Except there's no fun,
&gt;&gt; right? There's no fun. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
I wasn't getting free drinks. And so,
anyways, finally we got a customer then
got another customer and then we got it
to the point where it got it dialed in
where it was $100 a customer. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; They'd spend 105. So, in my head I'm
like, I've man I figured it out. and you
know they're going to stick around for
years until they move. So 100 bucks to
acquire a customer is good,
&gt;&gt; right? I was like, I figured it out. But
the truth is I didn't because I still
got to buy the bins, right? There's a
bunch of expenses on that. But in my
head, I'm like, I spend 100, they spend
105. The paid ads have paid for
themselves. And like you said, they
don't turn. So like, I should keep I
should put all my money to this. Since
then, we've spent more and more and more
and more money to the point now where uh
we've gotten it on certain months down
to like $35 to get a customer.
&gt;&gt; Now, let me ask you this. Like your

[21:01]
&gt;&gt; Now, let me ask you this. Like your
biggest competition is customers moving
away. Do you know yet how long a
customer will stay with you?
&gt;&gt; No, because we we haven't had somebody
cancel since we started. Now, we we're
not that old, right? We're not even 2
years old yet. And I think
&gt;&gt; that's silly. That's just silly.
&gt;&gt; I say that like we've had people move
and cancel, but we leave the bins. We've
never had somebody cancel because of our
service. I like to say the people who
left us, we fired.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Like it wasn't a good fit. You didn't
like us. We didn't like you. we'll
refund you all the cash. And so we've
had I think that happen twice.
&gt;&gt; If you take everyone who's moved in a
year and like divide and do all that, do
you have any idea how long people are
going to stay in their homes? Like what
your churn will be based on people?
&gt;&gt; I I think I'll sell the company before
they turn because when the bins are at
the house, if they leave, we still keep
that customer. Does that make sense?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, like unless I just start really
doing bad, which I don't plan on doing,
I don't think there's a reason for
somebody to switch cuz they're not going

[22:00]
somebody to switch cuz they're not going
to start taking it to the dump
themselves.
&gt;&gt; If the customer moves, there's a really
good chance you're going to get the new
&gt;&gt; the new resident as a customer,
&gt;&gt; right? So, we close their account, but
we keep the address open. So, then when
you're like setting up a CRM, it's like,
how do you do you do it on the address
or the customer? Like, uh, we do it on
the customer. But,
&gt;&gt; I think I read that people stay in their
homes like four years on average. So,
let's just say hypothetically if we're
trying to calculate your monthly churn
that you have 100 customers. It's
static, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Every year you're going to lose 25 of
them, right? Because you divide by four.
&gt;&gt; And then let's say you're able to keep
half of those because you just you send
a flyer or whatever and you you convert
them. That would be like 12 and a half%
churn per year or 1% per month, right?
&gt;&gt; I'm telling you. I think
&gt;&gt; so. So, if you look like a software
business, your churn is going to be 10
to 20%. This is like 1%.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And I I would I would argue that
if you leave the bin there, it's going
to be even lower cuz then they're like,
"Well, now I got to call you to come get
it,
&gt;&gt; and now I got to call them to bring a
new one.
&gt;&gt; Put your number on the sticker, sticker
on the bin. They're going to call you."
&gt;&gt; Well, we don't. We make our own bins
now. So, we manufacture it from scratch,

[23:02]
now. So, we manufacture it from scratch,
have it hot stamped with our logo on it,
and put it in that driveway. When they
cancel, we don't come pick it up. We're
like, "We'll leave that bin there."
&gt;&gt; Well, yeah. No, they'll What happens is
the new person will move in and they'll
just call. They're like, "Hey, here's
our trash company." And now we're to the
point where we're on the HOA. We're in
the utility districts. The neighbors are
telling you who to sign up for when you
move in.
&gt;&gt; So, it's like a snowball effect because
you're putting out little billboards in
front of people's house every single
day. It's one of like if you were just
drive down a street, you don't really
know who the roofer is. You don't really
know who made the mailbox or mowed the
lawn. Maybe the lawn guy will put like
the, you know, spray sign on, but the
trash is like very obviously branded.
&gt;&gt; True. So the the referral marketing,
it's like sheep herd marketing almost
where it's like, hey, two, three, five,
20, and it really kind of scales well.
That's the best way because now we're
not paying for those ads. So the bins
probably are our best source, but they
don't tell the story like your neighbor
would or a Facebook ad would. An old

[24:00]
would or a Facebook ad would. An old
wise men once said, "If you want to go
fast, go alone. If you want to go far,
go together." So if you want to build a
business like this sweaty startup,
internet, AI, it doesn't matter, check
out tkowners.com. It's where me, people
like Spencer and builders,
entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs is where we
hang out. We're building businesses. So,
come check us out. You won't regret it.
All right. So, if conservatively 1% or
less of your customers leave every
month, that means that the lifetime
value of one of your customers is $3,500
and you're spending 30ish to get them if
it's a referral or a hundredish to get
them from Facebook ads.
&gt;&gt; That's crazy. Like, you're putting in a
dollar and you're getting back a
hundred.
&gt;&gt; What's stopping others from starting
this business? Oh, nothing. I mean, we
passed a guy at the landfill earlier
today who was driving pulling a trailer
full of trash. So, like that's the
easiest way to start it. I mean, if you
were really bootstrap this, I think the
pre-sales thing I was lucky with. I
don't think everyone can do that unless
there's a perfect storm of like a
business sells and the new buyer sucks.
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Right. So, that that was a perfect storm
and I'm lucky. I'll call I'll be the

[25:00]
and I'm lucky. I'll call I'll be the
first one to call it out. I'm sure it'll
be in the comments. But, if you wanted
to start this on your own, you could
definitely start it for like next to
nothing, right? So, like you don't get
the cash influx that I had because of
the pre-sales. You could buy a trailer
and start it there. Uh there's a guy on
Twitter that I follow right now. Um
which is funny cuz he's starting a trash
company and he started with just bulk
trash pickup like a truck and a trailer
&gt;&gt; and he would then moved into dumpsters
&gt;&gt; like 1800 Got Junk type stuff.
&gt;&gt; Yep. 100%. Basically, he was just
picking up people's crap on like
Facebook. Like that's the lowest entry
and you can start with a truck. Yep.
Maybe not a cyber truck, you know? You
can start with like a F-150, but like
you can bill for that like 600 bucks,
whatever, and that can be how you start.
And then you get a trailer, and then
that trailer can not only take stuff to
the landfill, but it can pick up bags.
That is the easiest and cheapest way to
start. I think I don't know if I
personally would have done that just
because it it's a lot of work.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Uh this felt like I could cut the start
line and do it without
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

[26:00]
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Uh but that's how I would do it. Yeah. I
would start with bulk pickup. Facebook
will pick up your trash. Then I would go
to trailer. Then I'd go to trailer drop
in. And then I would build. I think a
big part that we talked about is like
building a brand. If you can tell a
story, this is where people get lost.
You don't have to be a good storyteller.
Just say like, "Hey, I'm going to start
picking up trash and here's why I didn't
like this. We're doing this, so I'm
going to start picking up trash." And
then you just keep doing that. And then
what happens is this weird kind of
snowball effect happens where you get
branded bins. Now the bins are out. Now
you've got 10 customers and you just
say, "Hey, if you don't mind, can you
refer your neighbors? I'll give you a
free month of trash." And now you've got
two snowballs rolling. And I personally
think that that's a good way to go about
it because if you were to exit,
subscription businesses tend to sell
more because instead of like running a
plumbing company or HVAC company Y, I'm
not knocking them. It's a little bit of
a brand
&gt;&gt; only as good as your next deal
&gt;&gt; next month. Next month, you have to

[27:00]
&gt;&gt; next month. Next month, you have to
start over every single month.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. where I might not grow as fast as
them or have the ticket volume that they
have. I would love a $15,000, you know,
HBAC install. Uh, our stuff snowballs.
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, if I they might win in the short
term and if you don't save a bunch of
that money and tell a good story and do
branding and, you know, radio ads and
everything. This I can not tell as good
a story, but after 30 years, if you look
at the two businesses, I bet you could
be wrong. It's all based on the
operator, but subscription businesses,
much like software, sell it to multiple.
&gt;&gt; Back to the pre-sale thing, I feel like
if someone's watching this and they
wanted to do the pre-sale, they could
proactively join 10 to 20 neighborhood
Facebook groups in their local area and
just watch. Just sit in the background
and watch. Then you start, you go in and
search for the term trash, pickup,
garbage, are people already complaining?
And just start planting seeds. And then
one day, eventually a contract's going
to come up for renewal. Something's
going to happen. They're going to sell
the private equity. You don't have to
sit here and waiting,

[28:01]
sit here and waiting,
but you could like you could set all
these hooks in the water on next door
groups, Facebook groups.
&gt;&gt; Maybe I was subtly trying to convince
people not to compete with me. I'm just
kidding. No, you're you're 100% right.
With the Facebook groups, you have huge
distribution, right? So, like when you
start, just you don't have to
necessarily even wait. You could just
say like, "Hey, I'm starting. Tell your
story here. Tell your story there." I
think some stuff that I would have done
different like I I didn't put weight on
Google reviews at all.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And LSA ads. That's something that I
don't think enough people talk about.
For the first year and a half of this
business, we did not do a Google review.
And that was a mistake because when Chad
GPT came out, uh what ended up happening
in my opinion is Google started
prioritizing local businesses.
&gt;&gt; And so I think Google reviews number one
was something I would do different. And
then the LSA ads, for those who don't
know, LSA ad you only pay when you get
the lead. Yeah. Versus like Google
Paperclick where you pay to be top of
the rankings. LSA you just pay for like

[29:01]
the rankings. LSA you just pay for like
when you get a customer.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And like I set that thing at like $50 a
day. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And just let it go. And so I think
that's a that's probably one thing I
would redo. When you first asked that
question, I'm sitting there going like I
think we bought the truck, right? It's
still running today and in the route. I
think we bought the bins the cheapest
way. Maybe I would have financed them. I
think if you have a subscriber base or
you're building a subscriber base, have
the customers pay for your what your
needs.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Not you.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, if even if it's a bad loan terms, if
it fits inside of the business model,
you could, you know, the accountant, you
know, pencil pusher guy is going to tell
you you're paying whatever interest rate
and you can kind of look at and be like,
am I though? Because the customer is
paying for it. And so I think there's a
world where it's like if you can keep
the most amount of cash you can,
eventually it'll be paid off.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And that way you can invest in
marketing, get more customers to help
pay it off faster.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I think any bulk purchase can, if it can
be avoided, it should. Yeah.

[30:01]
be avoided, it should. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; It should be financed.
&gt;&gt; All right. So what could be a hangup in
this whole business model is the fact
that many people live in an HOA. The
trash truck is ugly and big and
unsightly smells.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Where do you even keep it?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, we keep it at a RV storage
facility, which is kind of funny because
there's just a bunch of RVs and then a
garbage truck. Yeah. And uh yeah, we
couldn't we So, we tried parking it in
front of the house. It was here for 4
days before we got a letter.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; And then it was like, "All right, let's
get it out of here." So, we went and
rented a RV storage facility down the
road, which I think it's about 4 minutes
door to door.
&gt;&gt; Wow. And what does it cost per month to
keep it there?
&gt;&gt; So, um I think we're at like 200 bucks a
month. Uh and so
&gt;&gt; that's like your fixed overhead, right?
Like Right. And that's for two trucks.
And
&gt;&gt; 200 bucks for two trucks.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And then we have a another storage
facility for the garbage bins, which I
guess we're weird because we put the
garbage bins in covered, you know, like
an actual storage unit, like a 30ft
storage unit.
&gt;&gt; Okay. But you don't have any other lot
or building or warehouse

[31:01]
or building or warehouse
&gt;&gt; soon. I wish
&gt;&gt; just your house and 200 bucks a month.
Okay. Now, uh I I kind of think that's
one of the magic things about what
you're doing is you're not only getting
100% financing for these trucks, but
you're buying them for like 70%
discounts.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Can we go see the storage facility and
then you can break down that secret
sauce?
&gt;&gt; 100%. You're going to love this place.
&gt;&gt; All right, let's check it out.
&gt;&gt; All right. So, you'll love this, Chris.
Municipality truck Facebook marketplace
group. There's trash truck groups.
&gt;&gt; Oh, sure.
&gt;&gt; A ton of them. There's like four or
five of them. There's huge trash trucks
under CDL trash trucks, four-wheel
trash, you know, crazy trash truck
groups.
&gt;&gt; And you're in all of them.
&gt;&gt; All of them, of course. And we totaled a
garbage truck, which sucked. And I was
looking for a new one.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Um, but anyways, so I needed a truck
immediately cuz our backup truck was
running the daily routes, and we had
outgrown it. So, in these uh Facebook
groups, I'm just scouring looking for
used trucks. I want something that can
take a whole truck, a whole day's worth
of trash instead of like half of the
day. M
&gt;&gt; cuz if you have to go to the dump twice,
it's an hour there, hour back, you're

[32:00]
it's an hour there, hour back, you're
wasting 3 hours.
&gt;&gt; That's the name of the game is route
density, right?
&gt;&gt; Route density. Route density. And then
one trip to the dump is huge. So I was
looking for something bigger. And I'm
scrolling through Facebook and there's a
guy in there saying I'm having a
municipality auction and this is where
the, you know, the Chris the Chris
mindset starts going in Witchah Falls.
&gt;&gt; I know where that is. Right on the
border.
&gt;&gt; Right on the b Witchah, Texas.
&gt;&gt; Uh in person live auction. That sounds
like a value to me.
&gt;&gt; Oh my god, this was I tell you what,
scrap together like 10 grand and go to
an auction. It's going to be the
greatest time of your life. So, we drive
out there and it he puts the inventory
online. He had two of these. So, this is
a 2020 Mac diesel with this is called a
Hy Durapac.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; And it had 50,000 miles.
&gt;&gt; How is that for like a trash truck? Is
that high, low?
&gt;&gt; 50,000 miles is nothing, dude. 50,000 mi
is like a test drive in my book. Like,
&gt;&gt; yeah, I mean, it's a it's it's got a
Cummings diesel and it's set up to pull

[33:00]
Cummings diesel and it's set up to pull
trash. Like, this thing should go for
300 400,000 miles. Love it.
&gt;&gt; And so, long story short, they had it
posted. They had a 2019 and a 2020 and
we're like, shoot, let's drive out
there. I called a I didn't have the
cash, which by the way is something I
didn't know that you had to have cash
and pay right then.
&gt;&gt; Wow. And so I called a credit card or a
equipment financing group and they got
me preapproved for 150 going out there
which is way more than I was even. They
should not have done that. It was
probably predatory almost. Uh so we go
out there and this was the last thing
with the auction. We get to this truck
and at this point this was the very last
item in the auction. We're there for 4
hours now. We talked about just buying
the uh Ford Explorers. They were
stripped and we're like let's just race
these home. Like this would be
hilarious. Like you could just turn
around and put it on Facebook
Marketplace and make money immediately.
&gt;&gt; I mean they were going $1,500. Like
these
&gt;&gt; Ford Explorers
&gt;&gt; Ford Explorer police. They pulled out
like all of the police stuff and it's

[34:01]
like all of the police stuff and it's
just like a torn down Ford Explorer with
like
&gt;&gt; I think they were all 2020 and above. So
I'm sitting there and uh I'm like man I
have no this thing could go for Facebook
Marketplace exact truck is selling for
190. Yeah. So, I'm like, I don't want to
pay that much. Uh, how much can I pay?
Like, it's a whole game in my head. We
got it for $60,000.
&gt;&gt; What was it worth?
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. It was worth $1 190. Like, if
I would have just taken it right there
and put it on Facebook Marketplace, it
would have been worth 190.
&gt;&gt; Oh my gosh. 130 grand profit.
&gt;&gt; Look at Look at this. Yeah. Yeah. So,
I'm sitting there. I haven't even pulled
the tag off it yet. Like I had to write
I had to scrub the stuff off the windows
because they had like lot 207 price
&gt;&gt; and these auctions happen all the time
all over America.
&gt;&gt; So this is the side hustle that you and
I need to do immediately. Every
municipality that services their own
trash buys trash truck. Plano as an
example. There's not many municipalities
that do that, but there are some. I
don't know if it's better or for worse.
That's another story you can you could
talk about. But what is happening is

[35:01]
talk about. But what is happening is
every five years they're auctioning the
trucks off and they're getting a new and
it's budget free for them, right?
Because
&gt;&gt; they're tax dollars. It's citybased
stuff. The the trick here, we need to
get a couple people in Philippines
&gt;&gt; and we need to call every municipality
in Texas, probably not that many, and
say, "Hey, where do you auction your
trucks off at?" And that's it.
&gt;&gt; And then we'll just have a, you know,
buy a list. Here's the trucks at at this
time and where. They would easily
defulge that cuz they want more biders.
They want more money. And then we can
find where all the trucks are going and
then maybe see if they're good or bad.
The bonus ones are the ones where it's
in person only. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Cuz no one no one from Florida is fly I
mean some people are if they want a
deal. The pros are Yeah.
&gt;&gt; are flying in and then getting them for
cheap. And so the other thing is I only
buy there's a truck company uh or a
garbage company called Hyo. H E I L. And
they have an office here in Dallas. And
I only buy Hyo because I can make a
phone call right now in 24 hours, have

[36:01]
phone call right now in 24 hours, have
somebody out here fixing the truck.
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; And so they could I could buy these
trucks and just have them repack them or
I say repack, refurb them and then just
pedal them. And I think you could make
dumb money doing that.
&gt;&gt; And this could be an eight figureure
business if you just bought and sold
dump trucks.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Easy. Easy. And then if you
put the work behind it that no one else
is doing, which is literally just call
the municipalities, say, "When are your
scheduled auctions for the year and what
inventory are you getting rid of?"
&gt;&gt; And they have they have to tell you that
information. It's
&gt;&gt; I don't know if they have to, but they
want to because they want more biders.
&gt;&gt; I think legally they have to publicize
that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, probably. And so that would be a
sweet business, I think. And you and if
you really wanted to do it in like a per
like a lowcost way. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You just list it do the listing
inventory listing. You don't even buy
them, right? And then you sell the list.
Like, hey, here's the municipality
auctions. Here are the trucks.
&gt;&gt; And what I love about it is it's a high
ticket item.
&gt;&gt; Like, you could probably charge $1,000
for a list or

[37:00]
for a list or
&gt;&gt; if you did, you know, and then you
could, for me, the reason I want to do
it is then I can go and get these,
&gt;&gt; get your own,
&gt;&gt; get these cheap trucks,
&gt;&gt; keep the best, and then
&gt;&gt; keep the once I get one in the one in
the rear, I can sell off whatever I
like. I could go buy a smaller. I don't
This is a little bit big for what we
need.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. What is your payment on this? So,
this is 1,700
&gt;&gt; a month.
&gt;&gt; A month.
&gt;&gt; What's your interest rate?
&gt;&gt; Uh, it wasn't too bad. I think it's like
maybe 8%.
&gt;&gt; Okay. And you didn't have to put
anything down.
&gt;&gt; So, that's the thing. I've put nothing
down on this. So, I could have literally
flipped this and made a boatload of
money cuz I financed it, right? I had
&gt;&gt; How would they feel if you did that? Do
they want you to pay it off early or do
they want you to just keep
&gt;&gt; a financer? No. These equip So, these
equipment financers, like they don't
want you to pay it off early. How much
does it take for the average Joe to get
approved by one of these equipment
financing companies? Do you need good
credit? How much do they pull or are
they just going to they're just using
that as collateral and they're going to
yank it back if you stop making
payments?
&gt;&gt; It's that so they're going to yank it
back. It depends. I would say it's
impossible to get approved, but then I'd
also say it's easy. So, we haven't been
in business for 2 years yet.

[38:01]
in business for 2 years yet.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, they always want to see that.
&gt;&gt; And we haven't. So, they don't see that.
And here's the kicker. It is September
when this is being recorded. I still
have a couple more days to file last
year's taxes, right? Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, I technically don't even have taxes
for the first year like papered up.
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, they couldn't really look at that
and be like, "All right, we can finance
this guy."
&gt;&gt; So,
&gt;&gt; so they want a pulse.
&gt;&gt; They want a pulse. Exactly. And it's a
little It's a little sharky. Like, I
would say be careful cuz I talked to
like four other people. They were really
sharky. It was like
&gt;&gt; It wasn't even a loan. It was like if
you let's say I had the cash to pay it
off, I had to pay the whole thing with
the interest. So like I'm like that's
not a loan. Like if I can't pay it off
early, like this is just now if the
business supports it and you're a risk
taker, fine.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Um but this one doesn't. This loan
doesn't have that. And so they were
obviously pumped to see me get a
$200,000 truck for 60,000. So if they
have to take it back, they'll probably
make money more money taking it back
than than me paying it off. If your

[39:00]
than than me paying it off. If your
payment is 1,700 a month, let's say this
had 100% route density. This truck was
full, busy, as busy as it can be. How
much revenue does this one truck
generate? Could it?
&gt;&gt; Oh, Chris, you're not allowed to hit me
with that. So, like I think it holds
about 400 houses.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Before going to the dump. And if you had
like insane route density,
&gt;&gt; you could do 800 or more, maybe even.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Well, think about like just go stop, go
stop, go stop, go stop.
&gt;&gt; So, total hypothetical. I'm not saying
this is realistic. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Let's say two trips to the dump. 800
trips 800 houses
&gt;&gt; in a day. Let's say for some weird
reason you're doing 30 days a month,
right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. If you broke it down per week,
it's like $9 a house per week, right?
Okay.
&gt;&gt; So 9 * 800 would be your number.
&gt;&gt; So 7,200 a day.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Let's say 7,000 a day times 30,000.
That's
&gt;&gt; 200 times 30 days. $210,000 a month
&gt;&gt; in like max potential revenue if you're
running and gunning.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like I'm not saying
you would do this.
&gt;&gt; No. Yeah, I would do it if I could. I
mean, it's a sales, right?

[40:00]
mean, it's a sales, right?
&gt;&gt; But in that case, it would be like your
payment on this would be less than 1% of
your revenue on this.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, it would be less than one
week, right? So, you just said 7,200
a day
&gt;&gt; times 30 days,
&gt;&gt; but the payment is 1750. So, it covers
itself in a day,
&gt;&gt; right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And if you ran it 5 days a week,
&gt;&gt; it covers itself in 3 hours.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. And so I called the city of
WY, which if you're watching this, I
want to win your business. We're here in
WY, service the people. Um,
&gt;&gt; your tax dollars are
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Heck yeah. Uh, and so I talked to
the previous city manager or mayor. He's
a customer. And I was like, what would
it cost like what would it take for me
to do WY? And he goes, the current
vendor who we do not speak their name,
does it with two trucks 5 days a week,
which I thought it would have been way
more than that.
&gt;&gt; And there's 60,000 people in WY.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Let's call that 20,000 homes. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; 20,000 homes. Two trucks.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Two trucks. But they're running
five. They might run seven days a week.
I sometimes see them on
&gt;&gt; according to the numbers we just broke
down. Like that's totally doable.

[41:00]
down. Like that's totally doable.
&gt;&gt; Well, so here's the thing. You win one
of these city contracts and this goes
from like a fun YouTube, you know, side
hustle to like the city of McKenna I
think was $20,000 or $20 million a year.
It was like aund I think it was 150,000
houses.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And I buy the bins from the same
company. She's like, "Yeah, uh, we can't
get you bins this week because we're
doing the city or this month or three
months cuz we're doing the city of
McKenna and that's an order of 300,000."
So, City of Mckenni just ordered
300,000.
&gt;&gt; If you got the whole city of Wy 20,000
homes, 40 bucks, we're talking 800,000 a
month.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; 20,000 times $40.
&gt;&gt; It scales well if you can the density,
right? If you get into these cities. So,
like we have we've got one city contract
right now that's like a micro city and
so we're trying to like just get build a
good reputation there. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And then but the thing is like again the
city of Wy can't have an outage, right?
So like it would be a risk for them to
do business with us. Like I can't like
not pick up trash one day. So like we
got to get a little bit more scale.
Yeah.

[42:00]
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Maybe more trucks, more employees. Um
like I said, we haven't even been in
business for 2 years. So I don't even
know if they would like open our
application. And here's how this works.
There's like three companies that can
bid it, right? So there's like Republic
and Plano. There's Waste Connections and
McKenna. Um, there's CWD and like
Irving, but CWD has been winning
everything. So, the CWD guy is my north
star and that's why I won't say anything
bad about him because there's rumors,
not rumors, Jo, let's call them jokes
going around in the trash industry. It's
very incestuous. And when you talk to
these guys, the CWD guy started in I
think like 1980 and he's just been he
only services Dallas. And from what I
hear, he's got just 200 million in just
trucks alone. He has his own recycling
facility and he wins every city
contract. The joke that I was kind of
alluding to is he's like a secret
billionaire.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Because he's privately held. No one
knows who if if he has any investors. He
started truck and trailer. Just did

[43:01]
started truck and trailer. Just did
time. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You know, put 40 years in and you'll be
a billionaire, right?
&gt;&gt; Just obviously got to there's a lot of
that happens between now and then.
He's driving from I think like Irving to
Nevada like service them and then drive
having his guys drive back.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Like he hasn't opened other lots or
anything like so CWD guy is probably the
good north star cuz
&gt;&gt; you can become a billionaire just doing
the trash in Dallas.
&gt;&gt; All right. So let's break down the
numbers of this business. This is your
second year you're wrapping up. What did
you do in revenue and profit your first
year?
&gt;&gt; Oh, you hit me with the profit. Uh
revenue I know we were in the 300
ballpark.
&gt;&gt; 300,000ish
&gt;&gt; which was Yeah. arr so I could
subscribers which is great because that
mean recurring revenue
&gt;&gt; right which means that money without
churn would fall over to this month or
this year um I don't think we made
really any profit because we were buying
bins and buying the trucks I think the
other thing was I stopped operating in
the business and started operating on
the business look at that you started
hiring people
&gt;&gt; yeah hired that's the word see how I

[44:01]
&gt;&gt; yeah hired that's the word see how I
buzzworded that on you
&gt;&gt; man I've been brainwashed um yeah so we
hired a driver I think if I would have
stayed in the truck, I probably could
have made 50, 60, 70 grand.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But it would have taken away from what I
was already doing. So instead, we
basically hired a driver. Kind of set
that salary right at that point.
&gt;&gt; What do you pay your drivers?
&gt;&gt; So we pay um 25 right now uh for our
main driver who drives a big truck. And
instead of being hourly, he's salary. So
fixed cost. Boom. Boom. Boom.
&gt;&gt; 50 grand.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yep. 50. Little probably more
after like bonuses and tips and stuff
like that,
&gt;&gt; which tip your trash driver. I think
more people need to do that. And then we
hired another one part-time. Um, and I
think he's at 17 or 18.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Uh, an hour. And so
&gt;&gt; those are your only two employees.
&gt;&gt; Only two employees. And my whole like
take on the business is like reinvest
everything.
&gt;&gt; If for some reason you wanted to milk
all the profit out of this and do it all
yourself. Could you hop on a truck and
do all the customers you have today?
&gt;&gt; No. By myself?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; If I did like 14 hour days, probably.

[45:01]
&gt;&gt; If I did like 14 hour days, probably.
Yeah. It's too many customers. And then
the bigger truck that we were in today
isn't suited for like some back roads.
Okay.
&gt;&gt; So we have a smaller truck basically
right now that runs strictly like the
difficult houses and then the bigger
truck does the the main bowl the density
houses. So like if I did it I would
either have to hop in and out of a truck
or I would have to go to the dump a
bunch of times like if I had the
littleer truck.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Um because it would fill up. So it's
like, you know, we've kind of figured it
out uh on that sense, but I don't think
I I think it would be a 14 16 hour day.
Yeah. So we get started at 5:30 every
day.
&gt;&gt; Okay. What's like the most revenue
you've done in the shortest amount of
time? Like when you really fill up your
routes, Monday to Wednesday or whatever,
how much revenue do you do?
&gt;&gt; A Wednesday is good for us because
there's 400 houses on a Wednesday. But
when you talk about revenue, it's
subscription, right? And then it's build
three month increments.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So I could hit you with a crazy number.
Well, just hit me with good, bad, like
realistic,
&gt;&gt; right? So, like a crazy number is like
when those first 200 houses signed up,

[46:01]
when those first 200 houses signed up,
right? So, that's 20 grand
&gt;&gt; basically getting dropped. And now we've
been doing this for over a year, so it's
more than 20 grand. So, like if I'm
doing let's say 40 grand a month and
then that 20 grand hits, there's there
could be a 60 $70,000 month, but then I
got to milk that for three months,
right? So, like you can really do good
and then you got but you got to manage
the money. Yeah. I would say like a
Wednesday is Wednesday is how we
started. Wednesday is still the best
because we picked up this neighborhood
in a in a neighboring neighborhood right
next to us. And that truck holds up to
400 houses. Right now we'll do 350
probably in that ballpark um with one
trip to the dump. And so my driver today
you it would make you smile. Basically
he can do I've had him do 400 houses in
like 4 hours and then he'll go to the
dump and be done in a 5 hour day. That
comes with like a lot of practice and
doing it every day and optimizing the
route. But yeah, he can he can do 400
houses. I would say he could probably do
400 houses in 4 hours.
&gt;&gt; So that's like if it's 9 bucks per

[47:00]
&gt;&gt; So that's like if it's 9 bucks per
pickup, right? That's 3,600 bucks in 4
hours of order.
&gt;&gt; $900 an hour. Back to route density.
Like you could like if you were doing 40
hours a week of just picking up trash,
that'd be like a,000 bucks an hour in
pickups.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; That's incredible.
&gt;&gt; The density is everything. I didn't know
that when we started, but then when you
do a neighborhood like this,
&gt;&gt; so like we can do some surrounding
neighborhoods. We can do three cities in
a day and that's not like a brag. That's
like you're driving too much.
&gt;&gt; Like I would rather have a neighborhood
with 400 houses.
&gt;&gt; What do your insurance costs run?
&gt;&gt; Insurance costs vary. So like right now
I think we're at like $1,600, like $800
a truck.
&gt;&gt; Is that like liability insurance or just
insurance on the truck?
&gt;&gt; That's a good question. So we have
general liability insurance of like a
million dollar and I think that was
$1,200 for the year. Oh wow.
&gt;&gt; It wasn't wasn't nothing.
&gt;&gt; So the real insurance costs are just on
the trucks.
&gt;&gt; If he hits something, if someone hits
him, we've got to cover their accident.
We've got to cover our accident. And you
know, insurance goes through the roof
when you're operating heavy machinery.
&gt;&gt; So you got one truck that's 700 a month

[48:01]
&gt;&gt; So you got one truck that's 700 a month
in payments, one, 1700. Right. So you're
looking at 2,400 and then you got 1,600
per month per truck for insurance.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; So 5,600 a month just in your trucks and
insurance. Then you got gas. Yeah. So,
we're spending about depending let's
let's call it 200 bucks a day
&gt;&gt; in gas per truck or total.
&gt;&gt; Per uh total.
&gt;&gt; What is that per month?
&gt;&gt; Cuz like how many days are you driving?
&gt;&gt; Uh we're driving five days a week.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So 20 days times 200. So 10,000 a
month in gas.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; Plus 5600. So 60 call it 16 grand. And
then you got your monthly storage 200
bucks. So and then you got your salary.
So 50 $50 to $60,000 a month in revenue
and about $30,000 in costs including
your salaries.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; That's good. That's 40% margins.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's I would say there's other
stuff that's not being calculated. We
got a tire replace today. We get a tire
replace every two weeks. Yeah. Oil
changes, repairs and maintenance.
Obviously these bins will eat your life

[49:00]
Obviously these bins will eat your life
away. Uh because they're about $50 to
buy. Pick them up, take them to storage
unit. the storage unit where we store
the bins at is 400 bucks a month. Okay.
&gt;&gt; And then uh we got to deliver them where
we pay for that and we pay the drivers
and then obviously the marketing costs
on Facebook and that can vary from $30 a
customer to you know $100 a customer. So
we're spend a couple thousand on that
and then uh Google pay-per-click. So it
slowly it adds up and then little things
that you'll get nickeled and dimed with
like we I say nickeled and dimed with.
We have a work phone in the truck with a
GPS tracker on that that tells them the
routes and where to go. And then I went
ahead and installed they're called SAM
SAH. It's a GPS tracker in the truck and
that'll give me the OBT2 sensors. So
like if there's like high temperature
engine light comes on or stuff like
that. And then we have forward facing
dash cams that record uh for like a
month storage. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; In case something happens. Yeah, there's
a lot. I would say there's a little bit
of nickel and dime stuff that kind of

[50:00]
of nickel and dime stuff that kind of
adds up with time.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, if someone's watching this and
they're excited, they want to try this,
where can they go to learn more, to get
help from you, etc.
&gt;&gt; If somebody wanted to reach out, they
could go to aka Spencerscott.com. And
the reason I'd have them go there
instead of Lonear Trash is cuz you're
going to fall into my ad strategy. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And I don't want to waste money on
people who just want to see ads.
&gt;&gt; Too bad cuz they might want to buy a
t-shirt.
&gt;&gt; They might. You could buy a t-shirt.
Yeah. shop. Lonear shop and we have a
bunch of fun merch.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Well, thanks Spencer.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, definitely. Nice to say see you
neighbor. Yep.
