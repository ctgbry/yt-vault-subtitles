RV parks can be massive cash cows but
they have to have all four of these
properties when I buy them number one
they need to be within City Limits why
because it prevents new competitors from
building right across the street number
two they need to have under Market rents
I don't care if they're full they're
probably full because they're too cheap
number three of four they need to have
low amenities why because that means I
can add amenities to increase the rents
even more
