[00:00]
I got into commercial power washing I
advocate everyone to do this that came
us about $1,800 a stop we probably do
between 400 500 600 maybe of coil
cleaning it's 600 Grand yeah dang next
year we'll do $450,000 of Christmas
lights get a yard sign the yard sign is
the single best thing you could have
I've done millions of dollars based on
that yard side he takes a couple Rock
flyers and goes and throws them in the
driveway that is how to Market
residential service I sold the service
before I had it I say this all the time
sell it before you have it
okay we're picking up where we left off
last week with Daniel if you missed the
episode a week ago today go back and
listen to that otherwise just keep
listening to this one you're going to
love it we're going to get super
specific about how to find customers how
to start home service businesses that
are fun and profitable enjoy what's the
best way to acquire customers in that
line of business I would use what's
called a rock flyer I call Rock flyer
it's a flyer with a bag and a rock or
the number one which if you're in the
service industry and you're listen list

[01:00]
service industry and you're listen list
to this podcast get a yard sign the
amount of people who don't have a yard
sign that's stupid wasted money it's
stupid you're idiots like the yard sign
is the single best thing you could have
you put in the yard they talk to their
neighbor they ask him about it whatever
it might be they drive past it cost I
don't care if it cost $10 it's $10 and
they're like $3 aren't they what yeah
whatever yeah you ask permission no you
just put it in there and how many have
complained do not ask
permission how many have
complained I don't care but like it's
I'm I'm trying to make the point of like
it's negligible people don't complain a
they don't complain B I want to talk
about that because too many people care
that people complain I want you to be so
mentally strong that you don't even care
that they complain
yeah I love it I love it my business my
business I've done hundreds of thousands
of dollar millions of dollars actually
based on that yard sign I want to one up
your plain comment so you ask me do
people
complain I have a lady who says Hey the
township like bust our chop about you

[02:01]
township like bust our chop about you
know this yard sign I'm like I'll pay
the fine I don't care sure next time
we're back in the area we'll pick it up
for you right I have that lady yes and
you know what we put a sign in our house
every
year even then even then it's Christmas
lights because guess what I probably do
14 of the 20 houses in that neighborhood
yeah 20 hous neighbor I do 14 of them
Christmas lights but I want to want up
your your your comment about do they
complain I had a lady call me and say yo
they forgot to put their yard sign
out she wants that sign she wants
everybody know she paid cring lights and
cring lights is the best and that's who
did my lights so that's amazing I make
sure tell do my guys know they do not
get in that truck unless it's full yard
signs like there's a I don't care if you
forget lights because you can still
drive the house put a sign out and we're
coming back but you do not forget a yard
sign how we got on that topic I was
asked how you acquire customers the yard
sign with the rock flyer they know you
put the yard sign out and then if while

[03:00]
put the yard sign out and then if while
one guy's packing the truck up usually
Crystal a three man crew the lowest
totem pull guy he takes a couple Rock
flyers and goes and throws them in the
in the driveway of like the adjacent
four or five houses that is how to
Market residential service I don't care
who you're I don't care if it's you name
it it doesn't matter that's why I'm
confident throw in the driveway thr
driveway if you want to put in the
mailbox go ahead like my opinion is like
you want to cause a Ruckus like you want
people I've had people literally call me
and complain about the rock F yes that
was a scary one like you know thank your
liter in they're going to call this on
you BL blah blah blah I'm like go ahead
dude I would love a nice newspaper
article we got find right I I literally
had someone say you threw these flyers
in our neighborhood but some of my
neighbors need
you I'm sorry I'm like are we
complaining or you want what do you
wants to do here you know some people
just like to complain and the best thing
you can do is let okay here's my advice
and we call carpet bombing I will
literally call it operation carpet bomb
the beginning of the springtime my

[04:00]
the beginning of the springtime my
residential guy knows for power washing
you go out there and you Hammer like you
just go out there and throw every
neighborhood that has this on it that
that needs a roof cleaned or house
washed or whatever and and then you
don't answer the phone for the next day
you be or or like three hours later
because you know like three hours after
you send these out you're gonna get
about 20 calls people were just gonna
yell at you the timing of it is key the
time is Key yeah just don't answer the
phone for like three hours and then the
next day it's going to be the no one
calls the next day to complain they call
right they pi it up right there they're
walking back to house like I hate these
guys they throw this trash in my you
know yard and then guess what the next
week they see us across the street the
neighbor's house who called we go watchh
their house just that's just how it
works that's so good no the best is the
person who asked for the sign that that
was my favorite give me a rough
guesstimate how many Rock Flyers have
you thrown and how many complaints have
you gotten like I know it's it's almost
impossible but like it's it's almost
impossible yeah I mean I've definitely
because we've been doing this for 12
years and every season we throw rock

[05:00]
years and every season we throw rock
Flyers we always do the Christmas lights
too I so best thing you do there have a
either a younger sibling or like a high
school kid they make the flyers in the
basement people have their own kids make
these flyers up I can have my kids you
do it it's flyer bag Rock staple that's
it on repat 20 30 40,000 Flyers you know
maybe more I mean I I've ordered 20,000
in one year before you know but I might
still have some of those you know and at
first I said to my manager I said dude
no one sees this flyer if it's in our
basement get it out launch it you know
toss that thing and so that's like
really important to to me is like making
sure like people know who who we are
right my dad used to say you can't catch
a fish if your hooks out of the water
because every five minutes let's try
this lure let's try that lure let's yep
nope yeah exactly but they got get the
lure in in the water and that's a really
good analogy so I actually just talked
to a friend before I call here OB on the
phone and he's like starting a new
business I said best advice I can give
you is that no one knows who you are so
look at yourself in the mirror because

[06:00]
look at yourself in the mirror because
it's the only person who knows right now
that you're starting a business and you
need it to be everybody yeah and the
more people know the better you're going
to be I mean that's really like on a
dayto basis like that's what I do is
make sure people know who are coil
cleaning business because it's my
favorite thing to do is our best margins
I just make more and more people know
this what we offer but yeah Christal
lights is is great I really added that
on to the employees to be able to have a
something to do for like from November
to janary it's kind of like it's kind of
like a homeb builder like always needing
something for his contractors to do like
yeah we'll take this this carpet job
yeah we'll do this drywall job it keeps
my guys busy it's kind of that
equivalent well exactly but then it
actually turned into a really great
business and we're like oh wow like you
I'll put 90 grand in my pocket at the
end of the crystal lights he's my
brother he's my partner in Crystal
lights he puts 90 grand in his pocket
and like we kind of it's like guaranteed
after you know from we were working like
three quarter days from September
October 1st until
about December 10th 12th and because the
calls die off and then we have to go
take them down but you could put up like

[07:00]
take them down but you could put up like
three or four houses five houses in a
day like if your crew is skilled we
could take it down about 15 in a
day great 500 a pop how much per job
yeah no our minimum is $800 so we won't
we I'm a lot cheaper than your customers
I pay five I beat them up with price we
won't that's a perfect example of like
hey that's great you pay five because
there's someone else who wants to pay
eight and we tell them like look we only
have an eight-week window like if you
want to be on our schedule like this is
it if you don't see you later we don't
need you and that's like the best sales
pitch ever is like we don't care if
we're
fine all right 800 fine yeah I I and you
know we I we have a couple people who'
like switched from previous from other
companies now they're like yeah we just
that guy just rubs us the wrong way we
don't we we'll pay him to not come back
right we'll pay you guys so we don't to
deal with him you know what's hilarious
about all this I'm bragging about paying
500 and 10 ft away from me outside my
lights are still up cuz my cheap guy has
still not taken them down and it's
January 23rd right now see that you're

[08:02]
January 23rd right now see that you're
you're getting that's that's exactly and
we had people like switch to us because
like he didn't put my lights up till
like December 10th I'm like well if you
were our customer like we'd have you
ready to go in October November or
wherever you want to plug them in just
to fire them up so yeah like there's
there's you could pay for some
professionalism there but our most
expensive five $6,000 lights jobs that
people do that's amazing what kind of
bags do you use for your rock flers like
Ziploc I had a company at Orlando they
they make this fly they make this
plastic bag that fits my flyer well and
it's like branded no the Flyers is the
brand okay it's just it's just nice and
neat and just like clear plastic yeah
clear plastic bag thin it just keeps it
from getting wet and you know stap over
the top but yeah I have it speced out
okay where do you get the rocks from
like a bag at Home Depot bag Home
Depot's fine the driveway whatever you
know whatever rock you want you you want
to be a good weight you you're throwing
that thing you don't want to be like too
heavy where it blows out you don't want
to be too light where it flies in into
the yard like kind of want the ideal I

[09:02]
the yard like kind of want the ideal I
recommend giving a few tosses to see how
many rocks you want yeah okay that's
actually a funnier phone call people
like what do I do with this
rock yeah whatever you want I don't care
throw in the yard with a rock you need
you need more to do think Rock help them
clean their
house what I do yeah oh all right so you
use Rock Flyers to find any home service
job residential anyone yes and Ys those
two combinations of those things the
Third Secret there is you have a WRA
vehicle but yes like you have a yard
sign you the initial contact right like
what is the initial contact is it a
Google click is it a postcard is it a
rock flyer like what is the initial
contact like you know for your customer
and then there's other forms of contact
where the initial one is that that rock
flyer the second contact is they you
know see your wrap truck the Third
Contact is that yard sign in the yard
right those all those things go into
your next customer what would you say
roughly your conversion rate is on these

[10:01]
roughly your conversion rate is on these
Rock Flyers you get two customers three
they're 100 so it's probably between
five and 10 I would say 100 yeah crazy
once again it's highly targeted it's the
custo because you're choosing the
customer right like you know the house
you're throwing it to right yeah I'm not
throwing these in Center City wsp Grand
right I'm throwing them to the outskirts
where I'm throwing them to a golf course
Community right where the people have
someone I'm I'm selecting it that's why
I honestly hate AdWords and that stuff
because it's such a blanket coverage
that it's just picking so much garbage
you know I just trash customers are not
my customer and I've done such a good
job of like identifying my customer
which I think a lot of people have to do
that like ident who is your customer and
knowing that is leads to a lot more
success yeah dude I I've said this quote
like a dozen times over the last month
sometimes on this podcast because I'm
obsessed with it and it's the harder way
is usually the Better Way AdWords are

[11:00]
is usually the Better Way AdWords are
easy Facebook ads are easy right it's
you just oh I just want to sit in my
office and put up some AdWords and do it
but it's not as effective actually
stuffing these bags with rocks stapling
them getting in the truck driving around
maybe it's hot maybe it's cold maybe
it's raining going to the Strategic
neighborhoods throwing them it just it's
so much more fruitful going to the
networking meetings where where you find
the guy that has a $12,000 water tower
contract like you're not finding him
with AdWords you're just not you got to
get outside of your house yeah that was
wrestling pizza party I coach my kids
wrestling dude I'm a wrestler I'm a
wrestler I'm not good but I wrestle yeah
iest but yeah as well I was standing
next to yes my my my daughter she's
seven and I have a son who's five and I
was at there few years ago their
wrestling party and the dude next year
was wearing a shirt that said you one of
the companies I was trying to get into
I'm like yo what's with this he's like I
do that I'm like oh I coach with you and
which is kind of how I was I was taught
that like I never ask people what they
do it was just funny how like we knew
each other all year from wrestling he

[12:00]
each other all year from wrestling he
was other coach but we never talked
about what we did and I'm like well I
can do this for you and he's like great
send me some prices so we that's did
like it's close to 100 Grand worth of
water towers geez all right so rap truck
Rock Flyers yard signs that's the recipe
for finding customers in any Home
Service Niche residential that is the
way to go and I don't care who you are I
will battle you to the death on that one
I mean it doesn't it doesn't matter like
yes specifically yard signs after you do
a job at that house or like yard signs
anywhere like neighborhood entrances I
would use them for both actually yeah I
I like a yard sign at the neighborhood
entrance as well if you're not getting
yelled at by like zoning or somebody
you're not putting enough out that's
also uh factual but if the guy is
showing up I don't care if it's Plumbing
right it's very simple math it's it's if
I'm going to your house the house next
to you is probably built the exact same
time so if your water heater is going
bad guess whose water heater is going
bad next

[13:00]
bad next
everyone around you so the plumber even
though like mine is a little easier
because it's outside like you could see
the house being cleaned right blacktop
asphalt you can see the asphalt being
done you want that yard sign no never
ask hey soon as the guys get out of the
truck I want the yard sign out before
the job's done I out like yeah the first
minute
they my guys know like as soon one gu
tell the truck goes hook up water next I
get tell the truck to put a yard sign
out it's a very simple recipe for
success for residential business no
matter which business it is it's it's
that's say do do you do anything
specific with your copywriting like with
the signage like cuz when I put out yard
signs I want it to be as obvious as
possible the letters need to be as big
as possible if the logo doesn't add
value there's no logo phone number name
like what do you do on your copywriting
on both your flyers and your yard signs
that has proven to be effective so
Flyers are different so and one of the
things someone said to me which I I was
a really great idea is always get them
to the website right like because I

[14:02]
to the website right like because I
could give you like this much
information on a flyer but I could give
you this much information like massive
amounts information on a website so you
always want to get them to a website
ideally whether through a postcard or
for your flyer but on a flyer um for
Christmas lights we break down like the
process of like Hey we're going to
design it we're going to install it
we're going to maintain it we're going
to take it down right like those those
are four bullet points right on the
flyer so they know what they're getting
and then a picture of house that's done
with a yard sign it is company name
because people I think make the mistakes
so much they don't put their company
name on it like gutter cleaning it's
like well who who who clean gutters it
drives me up a wall that tells me that
it's Chuck in a truck yes right yes yep
so you want first thing to do is put our
name on top right it's cringle lights
who did it it's Apex softwash who did it
that's that's number one and then the
second thing would be the service done
right and a phone number so like what
was what do we do I actually it's funny
I don't even think kingle lights has a

[15:01]
I don't even think kingle lights has a
service cuz like it's kind of self-
implied but for Apex softwash roof
cleaning or house wash like that like
that that's the main the biggest ticket
item that got done I would have on the
the art side but let's say it's a
plumber you can't put it on there then
just put the name of the business and
the phone number that's it because
they're GNA they're going to talk to the
neighbor they're gonna find out what was
done you you were a so video is cool but
you know what's better long form audio
via podcast and my newsletter TKO
pod.com
go there to subscribe for free to my
newsletter it's one email a week very
tactical and then go to my audio podcast
three episodes a week stuff like this
you're going to love it all free no
sleazy sales TKO pod.com if I did
a bad job how long you leave that yard
side of the yard for yeah you're you're
ripped out in three seconds that's the
implied message right implied message is
that like this person was a trusted
person came my house they did good they
didn't rob me you know didn't assault my
wife or dog or whoever's in the house
like this is this they they're a
reputable and the same principles you

[16:01]
reputable and the same principles you
know if you sell a house you got a yard
sign out there for the realtor why do
you leave the sign out there and put
sold on it the house is already sold
like you you're doing the realtor a
solid they did a good job right if they
did a crap job they wouldn't leave it up
yeah exactly so that's that's a to me
there's not even a topic or discussion
to be had that is just yes and move on
to to next which is whatever as far as
my my journey goes not that I never have
enough I'm definitely a person like I'm
always like trying to I'm always hungry
for for for more but I like to work out
so this is kind of a funny story my my
brother and I or actually probably just
me in the beginning there's a local
College Kings College actually a lot of
people from Utah ended up coming to
King's College because of their pa
program we had no gym so Hometown had no
gym and it really drove me not outside
and drive downtown I live on top of a
mountain so like there's a physical
barrier called the mountain that bad
weather just in general like no one
wants to drive down the mountain it adds
an extra 5 minutes to your trip that you
don't want to do how many people live up
on the Mountain probably like 12 to

[17:01]
on the Mountain probably like 12 to
15,000 now yeah maybe oh wow okay quite
a
bit certainly enough to have a gym
certainly enough to have a gym so I
would drive downtown and I'm probably 25
at the time and so I'm I'm actually
sneaking into this College gym I'm I'm I
no longer in college look like I'm in
college but don't go to college I just
like to work out and it just happens to
be the better gym in the area to to work
out or I just liked this one and it was
free cuz I was sneaking in so at first I
like had someone's ID and scan out the
door and and go work out and then you do
my thing and leave and then that person
graduated so I didn't have their ID
anymore but I familiar with a security
guard every day just from walking in I I
I was there more than any student in
King's College history and I didn't go
there so you just waited the security
guard and then I would time it where
like it was a glass door when someone
was walking out of the gym
I just kind of hang in the parking lot

[18:00]
I just kind of hang in the parking lot
yep hang right there or like if no one
was at the glass tour always go to the
bathroom or water fountain right to help
your timing out yep and then you're
they're walking out i' walking in i' go
use the gym so now it's like I don't
know like year five like I did for a
while like I mean like every like I
would go five times a week and and use
this gym so now I'm in there working out
and this one kid like leaves his weights
like all over the floor like they're
just a complete disarray and he leaves
he's like out on the street and the way
you see all glass windows like which way
this kid went so I walk out of the gym I
open the door I yell like yo buddy I'm
like you done with your weights he's
like yeah I'm come clean them up right
and security guards made fun of me for
like the next year after that then I was
like the gym police making
sure you're like that Viral Tik tocker
that like he takes zip ties to the
shopping carts and if someone leaves
them out there he he ties them to the
car like you're a you're a vigilante for
good I I am and that's exactly right so
I ended up doing this for probably

[19:00]
I ended up doing this for probably
six years seven years I don't know but I
actually like was designing I was get
ideas for the gym I wanted to build and
like it worked out that the one time I
was in there like it was all the college
students are on break right and I'm not
sure if they thought I was now like
Professor because I've been there for so
long I'm working out then I my it was
great you could bring your own speaker
play your own music it was it was
awesome and security guard walks in I'm
like oh no like I'm busted like I'm the
only person here I have no ID like I'm
not and so before he says something to
me I said what song you want to hear and
you'll put his song on and he started
working out with me that's amazing yeah
it was great so but it gave me the the
knowledge and like I understood we built
a 24-hour gym and because I knew how to
sneak into a gym I knew how to prevent
people from sneaking into our our own
gym and so it was cool so we built a gym
and how did you build it from scratch
like that's I can't get that out of my
head like what did you do so something
we didn't talk about but it's like the
next level of business is taxes and we

[20:00]
next level of business is taxes and we
ended up power washing business started
my childhood tree fort and I had needed
a place to go because we were growing so
bought a old carpet building my dad was
able to put his office in the middle
floor uh me and my wife moved into the
top floor and the basement area outside
area was our our shop for for Apex for
the powering business and with it though
came like two acres or three acres of
land right on our our main thoroughfare
in our hometown so
at Mountain I was talking about you have
to drive past this gym to leave mountain
top and uh so we had the land and
actually at my wedding I believe my my
dad was talking to someone a family
member who knew how to build stuff and
we're like all right well we have some
like able able bodied men and we don't
know what we're doing but like let's
let's do it so he was using it as like a
showpiece to build this like special
building and we were using it as like a
cheaper cost you know like we able to
build this thing for for 600 Grand when

[21:00]
build this thing for for 600 Grand when
our quote was for like 1.2 million to do
it so I understand why now it took us
three years to do it so far my favorite
quote from you so far has been we don't
know what we're doing so let's do it
like that's entrepreneurship that's
entrepreneurship yeah I mean my favorite
compliment I've ever gotten in my entire
life was from this guy who I I was I was
building a layout of the gym and I had
no idea what I was doing for a layout I
just only going to the gym that was
built previously in my hometown then and
going off that and and he said to me
he's like you don't know what you don't
know like and you're like okay admitting
that and I looked at him like I don't
even know what that means he's like
exactly and what he meant was like
you're I have zero fear to tell you I
don't know what I'm doing and one of my
biggest complaints is with these people
who like pretend to know what they're
doing and they don't and like that
drives me up a wall it's like dude like
why is it your ego like why are you
putting up front to to to know when like

[22:02]
putting up front to to to know when like
eventually gets exposed that you don't
know and I will be the first to admit
when I don't know something and that has
really been beneficial like you to me
because he looked at me he's like you
don't know what you're doing I'm like no
I don't know what I'm doing he's like
you want to lay your gym out this way
I'm like great you're you sell fitness
equipment like you know way more gyms
than I do like yeah okay what you just
said to me as long as it makes sense
I'll Trust it if what you say to me
doesn't make sense and I can't figure it
out then it's probably either you're
lying to me or you don't know I have a
pretty good intuition I'm sure you can
relate to that so this guy like gave me
the the layout I wanted for the gym and
how we should have it and I'm like yeah
that makes a lot of sense and then just
using like modern day psychology like
where the first thing you walk in is our
treadmill and why is it the treadmill
because it's the easiest most
comfortable most recognizable piece of
equipment in the gym and so anyone walks
in that gym like that's a treadmill
perfect I how to use that I'm now com

[23:00]
perfect I how to use that I'm now com
right I'm not overwhelmed I want to St
you want to stay here the most intricate
or like you most skillful piece of
equipment is going to be a squat rack
and it's all way in the back corner and
you know you keep these high skill
people away from the low skill people
and that's a that's by Design right and
it's the same as plan of fitnesses model
right like they want it to be
approachable to everyone approachable to
everybody and yeah inviting environment
having all that really important and I
think it's like year six now five now
yeah yeah somewhere I I I never really
keep track of that stuff I don't it
doesn't really bother me like when we
started or not I don't I always have
this like philosophy of like I can go
out of business tomorrow like I don't
know like something can happen and and
like we're we're done so like does it
really matter I've been here 10 years
like no because like the next year might
be last year and how's the gym doing is
it the only gym in town still so no we
had a
competitor I happened to your point I
was at a networking event this guy did a
really great topic he talked about was
really interesting I was really invested

[24:00]
really interesting I was really invested
in his his conversation I I was
participating in it and I went up to him
afterwards I said hey like I'm in
Mountain Top two I'm actually you know
building a gym and he took like two
steps back from me so you just told him
that you owned a gym and that's when he
was standing yeah he owned he owned two
buildings and a manufacturing plant like
in the same Hometown as I did and we're
talking about stuff I'm like oh well hey
I'm in Mountain Top I'm going to
actually do this and he took those two
steps back he's like I have to tell
something he's like I just like emailed
a guy at least to sign one of my
warehouse spaces to put a gym in and he
and you were about to open or you'd
already opened I'm about to start
building like I I I have the land clear
like I have the land ready like a permit
just got approved the gu's like I don't
know what to do here because I just met
you and you're cool but like I just
signed this lease with this guy like so
I'm telling you both like what's going
on and I said to the guy I said look he
just signed he's like in the process of
signing a lease like you might save him
some money You by telling him don't do
it and which I don't know that's seen as

[25:01]
it and which I don't know that's seen as
like cocky from my standpoint but I was
like yo we just spend 100 Grand
engineering like we're doing it and and
the guy's like your location's better
than mine is so I was just gonna say
that you have a killer location our
location is fantastic he's like in
industrial park back like still I I've
not on purpose I've never driven past
this guy's place just because of where
it is whereas like he has to drive past
my place to get to his place and so the
guy he emailed me said hey he's going to
move forward he's going to do it and and
this is actually kind of funny I I do
like the not that I'm purposely
competitive but I'm definitely I enjoy
the game and he he built his gym he was
open first it took us longer because he
was just renting a space out we were
building it from scratch our first month
we added a thousand members so went from
zero to thousand like maybe a month and
a half you know but that's a tenth of
the Town yeah yeah which is funny
because that if you look up the numbers
like that's how many members like the
person doing the business plan doing the
math you have about 10% of people who
own gym memberships like in the United

[26:01]
own gym memberships like in the United
States so like that was the goal 10 the
town we're saturated we're done yeah
which is part of a problem I'm having
now is that we are at the ceiling it's
like what do you do when you hit a
ceiling right I can't do anym so I spend
very little time on the gym because
raise prices not want to but that guy he
was only open wasn't open on Sundays
right so one of the first things we did
was show your ID Sunday so if you were a
member of any other gym in the area you
could show your ID on Sundays and work
out rgm for free so after like two
months the guy's like well I guess I got
to open on Sunday because all my people
are like leaving to go here and so you
sorry you let them work out for free if
it was on a Sunday anyone even if they
weren't a member yeah brilliant show
your ID Sunday so just show your ID and
then you come into our place and and
check it out and and use it and get
familiar with it were you able to track
how many you converted from that I don't
I'm not a big track convert guy which
like my one friend hates that yeah like
dude I just know it works yeah like I'm

[27:00]
dude I just know it works yeah like I'm
not going to waste my time like tracking
if I already know it's good to go well
like you're familiar with the mid whip
meme right like the distribution curve
on one end it's like it just works and
then in the middle it's like no we got
to track this we got a conversion rate
what are the attribution metrics we're
using UTM parameters yet and then on the
other end it's like it just works it
just works it just works you graduate
past all that tracking yeah I don't
think it's that important as long as
like you have a a pulse on it right I
was at the gym I can see faces I didn't
recognize I'm like okay this you know
what's going on here and and I knew he
had a couple hundred members that might
have won't work out on Sundays it was
Clos so why not do it and so it worked
out well enough where in like four
months he closed up shop went out of
business and so I felt kind of bad but
at the same time like I don't feel bad
I'm like dude you didn't try he had the
luxury of being warned and he ignored it
how often do people get that yeah not
that like I mean if it were you would
you have ignored him right in his
defense I did warn him I the right thing
and said hey I'm saying you probably

[28:00]
and said hey I'm saying you probably
would have opened too anyway if if the
roles were reversed right based on my
location I don't know like it's really
hard to beat our our stuff but to your
point maybe because someone else the
confidence someone moved into his space
who already had do gyms the area I'm not
sure how well they're doing but so we do
have another gym now in Hometown and you
know so there's some competition there
but you know we're still doing well and
and I honestly think we're at that that
ceiling where like yeah like you said
you could raise prices but then you're
changing your mind model from you know
high value to higher cost so what's your
monthly cost and how many members do you
have today so we started at 25 and
during Co we race it like cost of
everything kind of went up and cleaning
chemicals went up we changed it to 29 I
actually wanted to kind of change it
early before like inflation kind of hit
I was more so raising prices just on
kind of your principle of like cutting
some people out but also we had more
cost with Co so charging 29 and we're
about 1,00 members nice
we were at 1500 before Co and Co like

[29:02]
we were at 1500 before Co and Co like
killed people or some people like never
came back to the gym who like are afraid
of of Co so crazy like still battling
back from that Co times which I say if
you survive Co you can survive like
anything ever in the gym business
especially what did you do to get those
first thousand customers so quickly
brand new just opening yeah like there
was there was that other gym that didn't
know it didn't even know the other gym
existed so like it was we bought the
land yeah I I spent 200 Grand on land
like that was I told that was my
marketing like yeah land like you cannot
so much pent up demand no Supply right
place right time yeah which is why you
open that was your whole thesis that was
my thesis and like it's funny because
you talk to people like I usually don't
say anything to anybody when it comes to
like business I'm like a very like shut
up until it's done right type guy
because like you there's people who like
talk right like oh I'm going to do this
I'm gonna have five locations I'm like
shut up like do it right so I I remember
being like you getting like you for ice
cream and and someone overheard it gu's

[30:02]
cream and and someone overheard it gu's
like wait a minute you're putting a gym
in the mount up like yeah he's like oh
my God it's amazing right like so
everybody kind of had the same thing it
was like that's a home run like that's
all you heard it's a home run like you
you'll do well but if you didn't have
the right business you could definitely
screw it up but we did well and then my
brother his girlfriend he met was from
an area like about half hour north and
he's like yo they have no gym let's put
one there so we end up renting space and
put one there so oh two gyms yes we have
two gyms now and the hardest part is
trying to find that real estate for
another one so you kind of have to have
a good spot and a lot of the good places
are are are gone yeah but so we have two
gyms and that one does around the same
thing has around 1,200 members and um
it's good yeah they're actually one of
my favorite things is going to work out
at that one because no one knows who I
am and yeah get an incognito workout and
it's I play a little bit of like the
under Undercover Boss thing secret
shopper yeah secret shop it's fun it's
good I would give it a good review yeah
I I could talk to you all day I
literally have a headache which is
always a good sign from these podcasts

[31:00]
always a good sign from these podcasts
because I'm just like invested in
everything you're saying which means
it'll be a good a good one so good thank
you for your time yeah no I I I feel the
same way so whenever you know round two
or we'll discuss more kind Spirits I
mean it started off right with Diablo
too so you logging in tonight or what
you you logging on dude I haven't played
Diablo in years I haven't yeah I you
still play two I fired up during covid
and unfortunately it sucked it's crazy
and all all the stuff that we liked
about it there so many Bots like the
Bots ruin the game so like these guys
would play and have like their Bots
follow them so like they were going yeah
they're going to a chaos run and like
they would automatically have a buff
from the Barbarian they buff from the
Paladin like they would just have their
it was like stupid almost so and
everyone knew how to play the game and
be the best at it so like it too easy
like I used to love the struggle like
like yeah yeah yeah trying to go kill a
boss like bu ourselves like was such a
hard thing to do the only other thing I

[32:01]
hard thing to do the only other thing I
wanted to say to you and we'll hop off
uh try whatever is I was at my friend's
bachelor party in Pittsburgh and I was
like yo actually this dude on Twitter
that just hired this guy from India or
Pakistan to to teach his kid math or
physics whatever it was and across the
table this dude who I don't know who he
is Chase stands up he's like that's one
of my best
friends oh like what oh Chase green yeah
so that's amazing yeah it was a wild
dude start that's how I found you on
Twitter yeah exactly it was Chase just
standing up at a random Steak House in
Pittsburgh I've never met before either
yeah yeah so it was like one of the
first thing I said J and I were best
friends in high school that's so funny
it was wild there was like you know Six
Degrees of Separation like dude he do
you and I just saw tweeted which I want
to ask how's piano lessons going going
oh it's fine we actually have an

[33:00]
oh it's fine we actually have an
in-person tutor now believe it or not oh
so no it's not fine then because the
well no it was fine I just I upgraded I
upgraded in person I went up well you're
saying it was an upgrade so that's
feedback I'm looking for okay yeah it it
worked but it wasn't as good as in
person but it was much much cheaper oh
okay all right good to know yeah I a
piano and my kid is is kind of
interested one of the there's a teacher
down the street so I I just got to okay
dude I I forgot to ask you one thing and
I know we're out of time but what quick
real quick we can always recap whenever
you want to I'm good I'm flexible what's
the quick and dirty on the permanent
light business do you like it don't like
it the permanent light business from a
business standpoint sucks from a user
standpoint it's great an Indian guy I'm
saying he's Indian because Indian people
are very smart with their money he came
out I gave him a quote I usually don't
go to people's houses but it was
permanent so I I I come to the guy's
house you typic I just do everything
online I send I'm I'm not some Instagram
or some Twitter Fame for just a mic off
paint I I bring this guy I go to this

[34:00]
paint I I bring this guy I go to this
guy's house and he's like how much for
seasonal it's could be thousand bucks
say how much for permanent
$4,500 he's like okay permanent done I'm
like all right he's like why would
neverone do permanent I said because
some people don't do math and the guy's
like if I'm gonna do this for three four
years it's paid off it's an investment
yeah D I've had people pay me $20,000
like over the course of the last seven
years to do their seasonal whs and guy's
like it's a no-brainer it sucks as a
business because I I got a message today
like hey like what's with this right and
this lady can't she's 70 years old she
can't upload her
schedule and what am I supposed to do
about it right I I I can't train her any
better I can't you're not getting any
more money out of her I'm not getting
any more money out of it so I hate them
I like that's the the down dirties I
hate them but it could be a good like
quote down sell if if you don't get the

[35:00]
quote down sell if if you don't get the
the recurring sale it could be like a
throwaway sale yes but there's there's
unfortunately okay the seasonal after
January 5th or December 25th I never
hear from them the rest of the year and
guess what they're coming back next year
I've done almost $100,000 worth of
permanent lights and Perman is a new
thing the problem is I have now 25 or 20
liabilities out there yeah yeah because
if something goes wrong and these are
permanent like they're expecting it to
be literally a liability and your
seasonal stuff is literally an asset yep
period that's it so from a buiness
standpoint I actually hate the I mean
yes I can make like a $3,000 profit in
days worth of work but it just has that
underlying like loose sleep over it like
if if I did If I Had a Million if I had
let's say a thousand of these jobs out
there I would have to have a full-time
guy who just like handles stuff like
goes wrong you know permanent so this a

[36:00]
goes wrong you know permanent so this a
different business altogether it is yeah
