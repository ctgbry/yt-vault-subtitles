all right here's exactly how to find off
the radar obscure Parcels of land that
will print money this is day 13 of
giving you real estate hacks follow me
for more one you're going to find a very
popular wedding venue in a remote area
get a feel for their volume by calling
and asking how far in advance they're
booked and ask them where guests
normally stay two if guests stay in
hotels 20 plus minutes away you're
likely to have good demand for something
like an RV park three count the parking
spaces of this wedding venue on Google
Earth and ask them about their average
wedding size the red circle right here
is where we're building our next RV park
and the yellow circle is a very popular
wedding venue right next door the venue
owner is thrilled that we are moving in
that his guests finally have somewhere
to stay he does multiple 200 person
weddings per week and Nashville where
we're building outside of is a hot bed
