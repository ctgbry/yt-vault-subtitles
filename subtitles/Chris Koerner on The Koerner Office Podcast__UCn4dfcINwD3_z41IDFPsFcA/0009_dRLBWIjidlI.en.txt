hey guys uh Chris Kerner here so I I
want to talk about this park this RV
park that I'm standing at for a minute
I'm standing on an 8.7 acre Lake it's
really nice um I want to talk about four
things quick facts what I like about the
park what I don't like about the park
and then the meat left on the bone or
levers left to pull as I like to call it
what levers can we pull after we buy the
park that will really kind of crank up
the value so one facts we are 45 minutes
from Baton Rouge about 250,000 people
there and an hour from New Orleans uh
great location it's right on a highway
and then about 2 and a half miles off a
freeway so a lot of marketing
opportunities there you kind of have to
drive through a casino parking lot to
get here which is a little odd um but
it's also kind of cool because the
guests here can literally walk to some
amenities some attractions that we don't
have to pay for so other facts about the
park it's on 60 Acres 20 of the acres in
are in the back back uh it used to be

[01:00]
are in the back back uh it used to be
kind of camping sites but they abandoned
that there's a creek and a river back
there um 8.7 acres are here on this Lake
and you've got a gorgeous gazebo right
here and um it's just a really beautiful
setup you can tell there's some pride of
ownership and then the remaining what 30
Acres or so are comprised of 135 pads
sites um and it's about 90% full right
now on the pad sides we've got some FEMA
trailers which are actually in really
good condition these are like I think
single wide mobile homes but a little
bit shorter um and then you've got
mostly RVs and then you've got about a
dozen cabins nice wood cabins that
people live in long term so those are
the facts about the park what I like
about the park it's wellmaintained
um there is a lot of room left to grow
um if we do get the occupancy to 100
after raising rents then it only makes
sense to add more pad size um I love
that it has a lake this is a highly
sought after amenity there are other
amenities there's a pool you've got an

[02:00]
amenities there's a pool you've got an
arcade which you don't normally see and
you even have like a p put golf course
and a volleyball court you got a
laundromat in the back it's really cheap
and then you have three fixed structures
as well so you could just tell that
whoever built this park took really good
uh pride of ownership what I don't like
about the park so what I do like about
the park is it also has cement roads I
forgot to mention that you got like dirt
roads and then you've got crush Granite
you got asphalt and then you've got
cement which is great but one down side
is the cement is kind of in rough shape
there's some cracks couple here and
there um something that we might want to
fix not a big deal um could use some
tree trimming uh it looked kind of just
tired like it was well built but I
believe the owner passed away a couple
years ago and it's fallen into a little
bit of disrepair um but honestly I'm
kind of reaching to find things I
dislike about this park this is this why
we got it under contract because we
really like it it's a great part um
levers left to pull there's a lot so we

[03:01]
levers left to pull there's a lot so we
just talked to a nice lady in the
laundromat she talked her ears off she
was a great resource for us she told us
that people love living here uh she told
us what we already know and that's that
monthly rents are 5.95 which is pretty
outrageous um here in the area they're
1,000 to 1,200 bucks a month so this
park is full at 5.95 and we're buying it
at an 11% cap rate right so 2023 net
operating income was 330,000 and our
contracted purchase price is $3 million
so we're going in at an 11 cap which is
a great deal furthermore there's a lot
of room room left to raise the rents
furthermore they don't have Wi-Fi here
they do but they don't there's a couple
kind of spotty areas but it's the one
main complaint that the tenants have and
I can't even list that as a dislike
because it's a great cheap lever left to
pull when we can advertise hey we've got
starlink on both sides of the park we've
got 150 megabytes per second download
speeds that will really really breing
bring in the traffic um more levers left

[04:01]
bring in the traffic um more levers left
to pull we've got 20 vacant acres of
land that are on a creek and on a small
River we can do glamping back there um
if you put a nice glamping side up on
Airbnb it can command 150 to 300 a night
or we can just not try to reinvent the
wheel and put 30 40 50 more pads sites
and make this close to a 200 pad site
Park so at the end of the day if we
fully optimized this park um we're
buying it for three it's probably worth
about four after raising it's probably
worth about five or six if we completely
optimize it pretty it up a little bit
add some more pad s sits and or glamping
could be A8 n even $10 million Park here
in a couple years so there's a lot of
meat left on the bone it's a beautiful
Park I would be proud to own this park
and so hopefully here in about 8 weeks
we'll close we're going to wrap up the
deck send it out to our investors and
we'll have a good little asset under our
hands
