a local business that makes tens of
millions of dollars a year that most
people Overlook that is just so willing
to spend thousands of dollars a month on
X Y or Z what is it I found a website
that's really really interesting and I
want to monetize it somehow I don't
think you need to be CPA I think you can
use chat GPT and just the stuff that's
already out there but just focus on
helping entrepreneurs save car
dealerships spend a stupid amount of
money on marketing Direct Mail SEO you
name it if it might work they will all
of a sudden you've got
$992,000 that's gone away into a savings
account that you're not paying taxes
on I found a website that's really
really interesting and I want to
monetize it somehow but I'm I'm coming
up short okay is it called Wikipedia no
it's called distill
doio and what distill does I'm going to
pull it up it notifies you if something
on a website changes okay so as a family

[01:00]
on a website changes okay so as a family
we are going to the Alabama Auburn game
at the end of the month the Iron Bowl
but with sports tickets it can range if
Alabama loses the next two weeks they're
going to be cheaper right you just you
can't really know you don't know when
the best time is to buy them and so you
can use distill doio to be notified when
a ticket price drops but I think there's
a world where you could build a SAS on
top of this where you you could just
build like a ticket notification system
that's built on top of distill the io
and it's stupid simple easy to use it's
$10 a year or something cheap have you
heard of Scots cheap flights M it's kind
of like that it's like 70 bucks a year
and it's kind of an insurance policy
you're like I don't know how many times
I'm going to travel this year but if I
get an email and it says the flights to
Hawaii are 300 bucks right now we're
going to go to Hawaii and I'm going to
pay 70 bucks a year just for the
opportunity to save you know $1,000 on
tickets how could you use this to make
money who's using dtill toio right now
the messaging on their website is like
towards the ticketing websites take

[02:00]
towards the ticketing websites take
ticketing out of it why would I care if
a website updated here's the problem if
I cared enough for an website like an
update on on a website changing I'm
probably going to be on their emails
list so it has to be something where
you're interested enough to want to know
about it but not so interest like or
there's not a mechanism to update people
via a newsletter I'll give you some
ideas so let's say it's a Shopify site
that sells a product that people obsess
over Texas snacks we have have some
some pretty Advanced apps that will
notify people when something is back in
stock if they choose to be notified but
I would bet that most Shopify stores
don't have this you go look they're out
of stock at some point or another they
go back in stock and that just happens
when some random employee maybe a VA
just changes a number in the settings
and hits save then it goes back in stock
most Shopify stores do not have a
feature that will automatically notify
people now it might go in their next
news newsletter like days later but it

[03:01]
news newsletter like days later but it
might be sold out again by then so it
could work for Niche products like this
or websites like let's say you're a
major fan of some merch store or a food
store that doesn't have a feature like
this it could work for that it has to be
a business that is capitalizing on being
early so like one of the things that
that come to mind for me are a Trading
Company let's let somebody say somebody
who wants to invest in certain
businesses publicly traded companies
have to disclose every quarter and every
year their financials and those are 10ks
10 q's and so when the when the 10K is
published to their website because it'll
be published to their website how do you
know that it's being published I mean
this could be one of those things where
like you automatically get a
notification you go and read through the
10K or the 10q and if you're first to go
through and actually pull out anything
that's that's important you can have a
trading Advantage so that that's one way
although I'd have to believe that there
are already things that you can do like
that you know would be interesting sorry

[04:00]
that you know would be interesting sorry
this is like if you're a Searcher and
you're trying to buy a business you
could set up a bunch of like let's say
you find like different Target
businesses just different parameters
anytime that there's a change on their
website relative
to address pricing leadership teams I
mean that could be a signal to you that
something's going on with the company
I'm with you man there has to be
something there I'm going to read you
some ideas that they that they provide
on their website so legislative tracking
track budget find grants Bill tracking
get legislative calendar alerts
obviously those websites are super
outdated Enterprise Solutions medicine
and health jobs monitoring new jobs
being posted legal tracker patents real
estate track zoning laws stuff like that
so basically any of these ideas you
could build a business on top of right
like you could build a small SAS tool
that just tracks zoning Law changes in
Los Angeles County right there's a lot
of people that would really need and
want to know that as soon as possible or

[05:01]
want to know that as soon as possible or
it could cost them a lot of money right
it's true investigative content strategy
spy on your competitors ticketing cyber
security and I was just thinking more
broadly speaking as a framework I love
reaching out to companies like this and
asking whoever is reading my email how
are people using this in what creative
ways are people using this so do you
remember when I used to have an RV that
I rented out M so I rented it on RV
share and I was uh getting my MBA at TCU
at the time which meant I had a lot of
free time on my hands to surf the
Internet while I was supposed to be
learning and I distinctly remember
sitting in class making a spreadsheet
running all these searches on RV share
trying to reverse engineer what the most
in demand type of RV was youve got a
class A which looks like a tour bus
Class B which is like a converted van
and Class C which is like a motor home
like an RV with the engine attached
right and I distinctly remember M saying

[06:00]
right and I distinctly remember M saying
all right Dallas County for this weekend
how many Class A BCS are available for
rent this weekend no notice all right
there's 86 class A's there's 82 Class
B's and there's nine class C's huh
interesting well maybe they're just
aren't that many class C's listed let's
look six months out where few people
have booked same search oh there's 92
class A's there's 90 Class B's and
there's 60 class C's interesting so
there's just about as many listed in
each category but Class C is being
rented by far the most so if I want to
go out and buy an RV let's say I haven't
yet I'm gonna buy a Class C and you can
do this with Airbnb what types of
airbnbs we've talked about this in the
past you can reverse engineer just on
the airbnb's homepage what is the most
in demand just by searching for this
weekend and for a year out right I think
I have an idea for this if I I hold it
yeah sorry go no all right so I made
this big spread sheet and I was able to

[07:01]
this big spread sheet and I was able to
to get really close on like what is the
best type of RV to buy cuz then you look
at the price and you're like huh the
price for all three of these RVs are
about the same but a Class C is rented
four times as often why would I buy
something else if I'm doing this as a
business now if I want to buy an RV for
my family it's another story yeah and so
I I reached out to RV share at the time
and they were pretty small at the time
and I said hey I'd love to talk to
someone I know I sound crazy you know
look at my spreadsheet am I am I in the
ballpark here like cuz I haven't bought
the RV yet I want to buy something
that's good for my family and also I can
rent out turns out we wanted to buy a
Class C anyway and then I sent it to
this guy and he's like hey can do you
have time for a call I'm like oh uh yeah
I guess so I hop on the phone he's like
where did you get this data I'm like
from your homepage he's like this is
exactly right like I wish I could shout
it from the rooftops like Class C Class
C like if you want to do RV show as a
Business Class C RVs and I'm like oh
cool it worked and he was like super
impressed but I'm like literally I just
ran searches on your website so yeah

[08:00]
ran searches on your website so yeah
that is the framework here of just like
when you see something that's
interesting reach out to the business
and be like how can I make money with
this how are people making money with
this how are people using this in
surprising ways and you can come up with
all kinds of ideas hearing you talk I
think this would be an interesting thing
to do let's say that I I'm a company
that sells RVs right and I'm trying to
figure out a better way to convert on my
on my landing page or on my sales page
okay I think what I would do is I would
go and find 10 or 20
competitors and then just on their on
their purchase Pages let's say set up an
automation for anytime that there's a
change and see if I can pull any
patterns because it's like if they're
all maybe they've all changed the color
of the buy now button or maybe they've
all changed their script and they've
made it shorter right or maybe they're
all changing it to mention financing as
opposed to just paying cash like who who
knows what the changes are it'll take
some sort of analysis on your end but if
you went and pulled maybe 20 competitors

[09:01]
you went and pulled maybe 20 competitors
and then you're just seeing the updates
as they come in it would allow you to
make your conversion even better because
you're seeing what what's working for
other people because they're not
changing those things on those High
leverage Pages unless it's working yes
but your idea just gave me another idea
and okay I'm in dude okay so a local
business that makes tens of millions of
dollars a year that most people Overlook
that has a huge marketing budget that is
just so willing to spend thousands of
dollars a month on XY orz SAS tool to
give them a little Edge what is it car
dealerships car dealerships spend a
stupid amount of money on marketing
Direct Mail SEO you name it if it might
work they will buy it okay and I know
this because I have a friend now in the
space who sells software to these guys
and they spend like crazy so dude if I
live I used to work at a car deal
dealership in Tuskaloosa Alabama right
if I'm a dealership owner in if if I own

[10:01]
if I'm a dealership owner in if if I own
Nick sain Nissan in Tuscaloosa Alabama
I'm going to want to know how many
Nissans my local competitors are selling
you could go into them and this distill
the io costs like 10 bucks a month right
you could go into them and say hey I'm
going to send you a daily report of all
the all the cars that all of your
competitors within a 30-mile radius sold
the day before would that be helpful to
know oh my gosh yeah now we can like if
all the ultimas are gone then we can
mark up our Ultima if there's a zillion
ultimas on the market then we need to
cut our Ultima prices like dude how much
would they pay for something like that
give it for free for 30 days I'm gonna
install it all for free they don't know
it takes you like 10 minutes I'm G to
start sending you the reports and then
we'll talk price in 30 days but promise
me you'll read the reports because it's
going to be very
valuable that's yeah and that or real
estate right like how many homes did you
sell real estate would be a really good
one but like real estate's a little
trickier because it's in my experience
it's harder to sell into that whereas

[11:01]
it's harder to sell into that whereas
car dealerships have this marketing
Budget on their line line item marketing
budget that's massive it's just like yep
let's allocate three grand of this every
month and see how it goes whereas real
estate it's a little more stodgy I think
the framework is
literally where is there an Arbitrage if
you're quicker like if if you're able to
get information faster where is there an
Arbitrage and then you can reverse
engineer into any business that has that
function or component to it and use and
use dis still the io yeah
I love it all right if you are watching

and we'll see you there
CPA or silver tsunami well you know the
the acronym CPA like gives me anxiety

[12:01]
the acronym CPA like gives me anxiety
and makes me sleepy so let's go silver
tsunami all right let's go
CPA silver tsunami is the one I'm the
most excited about but I don't think we
have enough time for it all right so uh
Chris what's the biggest
expense that that employers have or
business owners have that they feel like
they have zero control
over taxes taxes yeah taxes right what
I'm about to say I don't think it's a
new idea or necessarily a novel idea but
I think it is novel in its application
but traditionally you have a CPA and
CPAs are telling you when to file
they're helping you with bookkeeping
they might even be helping you kind of
go through some tax strategy but usually
tax strategy is like way down the list
right I think there's space for attack
stria specifically for
entrepreneurs and
when you're talk when you're talking to

[13:00]
when you're talk when you're talking to
a
CPA how often do you talk to
Ross as infrequently as I'm able to yeah
maybe once or twice a year and it's
usually around filing deadlines right
just enough to not get audited and even
so I've been audited yeah it's but it's
very rushed you're like constantly
feeling like you're under the gun where
I think there's space is again not in
bookkeeping and accounting not in tax
filing and not in fractional CFO work
it's in helping entrepreneurs maximize
their Tax Strategies so here are some
examples what should I pay myself as an
entrepreneur there's rules around that
so you you have to pay yourself
something otherwise you get audited
because you're avoiding certain taxes
but you can't pay yourself too much
otherwise you're you're not complying
with the IRS rules okay how should I
handle retirement think think of it like
this when you are a business owner you
could contribute to a 401k why is it
important to contribute to a 401k I I
have literally a 401k is that an
ultramarathon

[14:01]
ultramarathon
I I don't know so good that's the most
responsible thing that I know nothing
about a 401k allows you to put pre-tax
dollars into a savings account that you
don't have to pay listen to me that you
don't have to pay taxes on so the idea
is you're going to have a lower tax
bracket when you retire than you do
right now so if I have
$50,000 and I'm a business owner I'm
probably going to pay somewhere in the
ballpark of like 30% $15,000
on in taxes if I put that money into a
401k after I retire my ta and then my
tax liability gets down to maybe 15% I
just cut my taxes in half right here's
the crazy thing you can contribute up to
$233,000 a year to a
401k but the company can also match
100% so for you is the your company that
you own your company that you own so you
now you have to make sure you can you
match everybody's you can't just match
like the owners like you there there's
certain rules but theoretically you

[15:00]
certain rules but theoretically you
could put $46,000 away pre-tax into a
savings account that just sits there
then you're like well that's not that
much money like okay well does your wife
do anything in the business yeah she
does something in the business great pay
her a salary and have it all go to the
401K and then match that 100% all of a
sudden you've got
$92,000 that's gone away into a savings
account that you just saved taxes on
you're not paying taxes on right and
there are IAS that you can contribute to
what I need to make I need to make a
call
but then you can also pay your kids
through the business they can contribute
to a 401k you could also contribute to
an IRA which is different than a 401k
401K has to be tied to a business and
Ira can be independent you can
contribute to that but the IRA limit to
of contributions is $7,500 a year okay
is that is that the the rifle
association it is it's it's well that's
this is the IR so this is the IR
International International Irish
revolutionary Association okay cool okay
that's savings then there's how do I pay

[16:01]
that's savings then there's how do I pay
my spouse and kids you can pay your kids
and spouse through the business for
doing actual work like and it's not
child labor laws
right or just knowing what are potential
big write-offs okay maybe I could ride
off a vehicle but what else you can ride
off a certain percentage of your
mortgage but there are very specific
rules phone internet meals vacations
then there's like real estate how do I
depreciate all that stuff so like in my
mind that's very different than hey how
do I file my taxes and it's the tax
Sherpa on on your team they would be
separate from the person filing your
taxes now if you if you did this you
like stay in your lane do not start
doing bookkeeping do not do start doing
tax there's plenty of money to be made
in this Lane yeah stay in this Lane and
you are essentially the advocate for the
business owner so that when the end of
the year comes and the business owner is
having those conversations with his
accountant which we've all had right
where you're talking to your CPA and
you're like well could I write this off
and they're like maybe it like Heming
and ha or you're like oh a friend of

[17:00]
and ha or you're like oh a friend of
mine told me about this deduction and
they're like yeah yeah that could work
for you and in the back of mind you're
like why didn't you know that deduction
know what I mean they're just not
thinking about it they have so many
returns so like this person's in your
corner they're looking for tax
deductions but you still got the check
of your regular CPA who's like that's
good or bad right and then they can
argue about it and like you don't have
to argue about whether or not it's a
it's a reasonable tax deduction so what
I would do in terms of fulfillment I
don't think you need to be a CPA I think
you can use cat GPT and just the stuff
that's already out there but just focus
on helping entrepreneurs save from a
pricing standpoint I'd be
like either pay me $10,000 or 25% of
whatever I save you yeah I like very
very easily measurable you get last
year's tax returns you just go through
it and then for distribution I would
just piggyback I would go to the tax and
bookkeeping firms and just say like hey
let me let me talk to your clients or I
would also start you know be the Twitter

[18:00]
would also start you know be the Twitter
Instagram YouTube Tax Guy where you're
just putting out tax information and
like some of these accounts already
exist but I think just leaning into it
and just being that just being that
Niche where you're providing value to
entrepreneurs who aren't yet Rich enough
to have like their on staff CPA because
like you get very rich yeah there's lots
of options to but you got to have a lot
of money for that there's there's a lot
more in the messy middle than there is
at the top yeah and then with like chpt
you can actually get to the answers of
these things fairly quickly or at least
points you in the right direction so
yeah you're not a JP Morgan Chase
Private Banker who's like giving tax
advice but you're still saving people
tens in some cases hundreds of thousands
of dollars a year on taxes yeah I I love
this idea honestly and I I love the
piggyback idea but I think you have to
change the incentive structure to get
the CPA in your corner and say my
pricing structure is 30% of any money
saved and I'm going to give you 30% of
that so you're effectively going to get

[19:01]
that so you're effectively going to get
10% of everything that I save this guy
for just referring him you don't have to
do any work I'll do all the work and
then he can be your Advocate like dude I
met this tax Sherpa he's legit like I'm
like in the weeds in your returns like I
know a lot of this stuff like I know a
lot of this stuff right like but like
this guy it's all he does and he doesn't
charge you anything up front he only
charges if he saves you money and then I
like the idea of that but but CPAs are
going to be like well as a fiduciary I
have to disclose that I'm going to be
getting a kickback and I don't feel
comfortable so like you'd have to figure
out some other way for them to be
incentivized to do it otherwise I just I
think it would get Messier if if you
start paying them not because I don't
think you should like you should pay
them it would be way more valuable you
probably get way more customers but I I
could just see a lot of CPA kind of oh
this feels dirty I need to tell my
client but if they like let's say you
get ahead of that and say we do advise
you tell your
client well you can do that you yeah you
can definitely do that and do you think

[20:01]
can definitely do that and do you think
honestly do you think clients would mind
and I'm not this isn't a leading
question I don't know like if if my CPA
came to me and said this and he's like
hey he charges 30% he is going to give
me a cut out of that but you don't have
to pay me you just pay him I don't think
I would mind if I was the CPA I would
probably just say hey this is a service
we provide and like not even tell them
about the pricing structure the biggest
problem is going to be the CPA signing
their name on recommendations and if if
you make the CPA feel like hey look
we're just an advisory service you don't
have time to go and find all these
deductions let us do this like we'll do
all of the work mhm you and the you know
the payment runs through you and then
you'll cut us our check our our portion
of it but you have final say over what
deductions actually get approved I think
that I think that actually probably be
the best way to do it because they're
going to feel comfortable with it the
customer is going to feel like it's run
through that agency and and there's not
going to be any real issues okay I like
it it's a good one graas all right Nick
it's time for mered dator kill we've got
the Reddit growth hack business in the

[21:01]
the Reddit growth hack business in the
Box idea distill the io and the CPA idea
okay who's going for you for me marry
the CPA
idea
date oh
man this is very selfish date distill no
date business in the Box
kill
Reddit okay and then distill is just in
no man's land distill the the yeah
tracking
software okay what is your reasoning no
no no you got to say yours first and
then we say our reasoning okay okay
mared dator kill marry I'm going to
marry the distill the io plan for car
dealerships specifically I I really
really really love that idea I'm gonna
date the Reddit growth hack idea and I'm
gonna kill
the business in the Box idea it's so
weird that we both married and dated our
our own ideas no it's just a coincidence

[22:00]
our own ideas no it's just a coincidence
distill doio I just felt like I not yet
cannot wrap my mind around like where
would I use this exact and how would I
use this right same with the Reddit
growth strategy it's just like how would
exactly would I would I do this I think
they're both really good marketing
strategies I just don't know about how
to build a business around
those that's fair I I didn't like to
still until we got to the very end of it
and talked about the car dealership idea
and I love that idea because you could
start generating those reports for the
car dealerships without them ever opting
in and just start emailing them to them
that's your distribution strategy give
it to them for free yeah and then you
send it in boys that's why I love that
business in the Box uh I killed that
because it's just hard I think it's it's
just hard to wrap my mind around and I I
date the Reddit growth hack idea because
I think it's underutilized and more
business people more capitalists should
own their own subreddit so they could
monetize
it done I love it all right that's a
list a WAP Jack all right what' you

[23:01]
list a WAP Jack all right what' you
think I legitimately want to go start
that car dealership tracking idea I
think that could be very valuable so if
you start it please email me let me know
how it's going and we will feature you
please share this with a friend
subscribe and we'll see you next time
