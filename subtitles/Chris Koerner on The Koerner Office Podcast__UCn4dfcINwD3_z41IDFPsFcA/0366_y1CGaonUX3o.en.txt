I just created something pretty genius
here's exactly how to copy me so we've
all heard of Reddit right if you ever
want to sell anything on the internet
Reddit is the Last Frontier because
those freaking moderators will delete
anything you post with links but what if
you were the moderator what if you own
your own subreddit where you are the
sole judge jury and executioner and then
you could grow that subreddit literally
while you sleep I just figured out how
to do that here's a high level overview
with no sales pitch incoming create a
zap on zapier choose Reddit as the
trigger choose new post as the first
step type in a keyword so your zap is
triggered every time new post with your
keyword is posted then you're going to
use open ai's API to automatically
create response comments to any targeted
Reddit post on any subreddit in the
world and then you're going to use AI to
comment on those posts something like
hey this is pretty interesting XYZ add
value but this post would be a better
fit in r/ the name of your subreddit I'm
doing this right now with my subreddit B
ideas it is working beautifully full
