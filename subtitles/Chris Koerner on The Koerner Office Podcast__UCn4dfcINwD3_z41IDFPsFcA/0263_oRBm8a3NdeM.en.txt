if you're an entrepreneur or a
entrepreneur you've got a big problem my
friend you don't get out more look at
this guy this is Dietrich he is the
founder of Red Bull in 1982 he traveled
to Thailand and he saw Red Bull he
brought it back to Austria and he
thought this will work here what is an
energy drink it didn't exist then he
started Distributing them at bars and
nightclubs instead of grocery stores
instead of a 12 ounce can it was an 8.6
ounce can he did whatever the freak he
wanted he did it his own way and why did
Red Bull work because he got out more he
traveled when you travel you open your
mind to New Concepts that will work in
your home market so if you can't think
of a good enough idea then you need to
get out travel maybe it's another state
maybe it's another country
