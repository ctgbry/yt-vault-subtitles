here's a fundamental problem with
entrepreneurship on the internet the
most reliable way to make 10 grand a
month in free cash flow is by starting a
digital agency yet everyone teaching how
to do that is trying to sell you a
course so they're all biased and you
don't know what's true well guess what
here are three tips for starting a
digital agency from someone that
genuinely has nothing to sell you no
course or anything to tune in number one
you need to go super Niche hyper Niche
we're talking like local SEO for
farmtable restaurants organic Snapchat
ad for Men's Wear brands AI powerered
email marketing for wholesale Brands
really Niche you can go broad later but
don't worry about that now number two
price yourself stupidly low like we're
talking $150 a month when everyone is
charging three grand keep increasing
your prices by 100 a month and until you
start to get push back you got to eat
crap for a while before you can charge
three grand a month number three
leverage AI hard embrace it say listen I
can charge less than everyone because
I'm using Ai and I can put out twice the
content go listen to my latest episode
of the ker office and I talk about this
stuff for 52 minutes
