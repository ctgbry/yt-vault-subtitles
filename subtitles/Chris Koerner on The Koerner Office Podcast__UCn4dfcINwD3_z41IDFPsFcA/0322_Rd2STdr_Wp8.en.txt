welcome to the ker office I had a friend
on the Pod today his name is Edward
Sturm and I met this guy because he made
a video about me on Tik Tok like three
years ago I had never heard of him and
his video went viral which put him on my
radar and we've been friends ever since
Edward is a viral growth marketing
genius he first went viral by playing a
prank in New York City that got viewed
over 100 million times so he talks about
what goes into doing something like that
but we also chatted about business ideas
because that's what we do here and
Edward brought up a brilliant idea to
take over a abandoned meetup groups some
of these that have thousands or tens of
thousands of members when the organizer
abandons the group meetups wants someone
to keep paying for it so they will let
anyone in the group take it over for 50
to 100 bucks giving you thousands or
tens of thousands of free leads and or
customers so we talk about that we talk
about the Curious learner bias and we
talk about unbundling large SAS tools
and how to use AI to point to the
features that are the most in demand
this is a great pod you're going to love
it please share it with a friend and
we'll see you next time

[01:00]
we'll see you next time
[Music]
time so we have Edward Sturm here and
Edward I found him accidentally because
I posted Twitter years ago about my
story with Heartland bread which I
haven't talked about a lot and he made a
Tik Tok about it I wasn't even on Tik
Tok and it went viral and I even have a
Tik Tok account for him to point to and
that kind of put him on my radar and
we've been friends ever since and so
Edward who are you introduce yourself
welcome oh man I'm so hyped to actually
I'll tell you what happened so I was an
early viral video producer on YouTube
from like 2009 to
2014 U this was before people knew that
like you could make a crazy career off
YouTube and we were just kids playing
with YouTube and we were going viral all
the time but we had no idea and and
actually we almost got a TV show from
this and we thought the hustle was going
from YouTube to TV like and and we
didn't get the TV show and then we were
demoralized and then we stopped what
year was this 12 wow yeah 2012 2012 we

[02:01]
year was this 12 wow yeah 2012 2012 we
had our first viral video in 2009 we
went really viral in 2012 we went on
Good Morning America The Today Show 2020
flown out to LA from New York because
I'm from Brooklyn we were flown out to
LA to be on the Jeff probe show and what
did you go viral for we got video called
fake celebrity pranks NYC and we so so
one morning I have this friend his name
is Brett Cohen one of my best friends in
the world now he's executive producer
and but we met in
200 2009 or 2008 as interns at WABC
which is New York City's local ABC
station and then it was 2012 and we were
video chatting over breakfast one time
and the thing about Brett is Brett was
one of the first podcasters ever you
should get Brett on the podcast he is
great Brett was coming up with amazing
schemes to get A-list celebrities on his
Blog Talk live podcast as a 17-year-old
kid he was a 17-year-old kid

[03:01]
kid he was a 17-year-old kid
interviewing Paris Hilton on his podcast
and Jimmy Fallon on his podcast and Kim
Kardashian on his podcast he is a
brilliant marketer you know Brett he had
this podcast and he sounded he he sounds
and looks like someone who should be
famous and I told him that when I when I
met him I thought he was actually like I
thought he was actually famous this is
in 2012 now lots of people have copied
us after I'm like Brett what if we go on
Craigslist and we just try to get like a
bunch of people to to disguise to to to
play Paparazzi to pretend that they are
Paparazzi and we walk through Time
Square with all these fake Paparazzi
following you and taking photos do you
think we could convince people that you
were famous and he's like he's like I'll
do you one better and like five minutes
later he had a post out on Craigslist
for for bodyguards and he's like we're
not gonna pay you but it's a cool idea
and so we got all these fake Paparazzi
two real bodyguards yeah for free who

[04:00]
two real bodyguards yeah for free who
just thought it was a fun idea two real
bodyguards a fake publicist and a fake
assistant and it almost actually what's
crazy is the whole video Everything
almost fell apart and Brett didn't tell
me until after because he knew it would
stress me out and I would freak out but
like
99% of our fake Paparazzi just decided
not to come right before the shoot but
then one of them brought all of her
friends that made up yeah and that made
up for all of it okay dude we got we got
lucky and so we start the video we walk
out of 30 Rock 30 Rockefeller Center and
I I have these fake Paparazzi lined up
with their cameras ready to take photos
I went to film school so I have like a
bunch of like film buddies who are
filming everything so we we filming it
from several different angles and
they're just doing it for fun and also
this is like good for their portfolio
like right away as the paparazzi are
standing at the entrance of 30 Rock
people are like who are they waiting for

[05:00]
people are like who are they waiting for
so then more people come and it already
starts to pick up steam and then Brett
walk walks through the entrance of 30
Rock or the exit of 30 Rock and he has
the bodyguards behind him and then the
fake Paparazzi start yelling Brett Brett
they're taking these photos and everyone
starts taking photos too not knowing who
Brett is and we walk into Time Square
and we literally stop traffic because
there are so many people trying to take
photos with Brett or of Brett and we no
one knows who he is no one knows who he
is nobody knows who he is and and then
that we didn't include this in the video
but at that same time there was a Snoop
Dog lookalike who was in Time Square
like his job is to be a Snoop Dog
lookalike and so Brett and him met just
randomly and then went and bought like
chocolate bars in CVS and we all thought
it was Snoop Dogg until the edit we
realized it wasn't Snoop Dog so you got
you got trolled trolling everyone yeah
we got trolled trolling everyone yeah
you that must have been like the most

[06:00]
you that must have been like the most
high energy manic like moment of your
entire life I ended up in the hospital
after so I left him he went to the
subway to go take the L back to Long
Island and I turn around and there's
scaffolding behind me so high off the
excitement and uh the scaffolding it
like slams into my face or I slam my
face into it and it my eye busts open so
you know I said we went really viral we
ended up on all these TV shows that
video got hundreds of millions of views
on YouTube it has like almost seven
million but then it was shared on
Facebook several times where it got
hundreds of millions and because it was
on the biggest TV shows in the world
international news shows huge American
shows hundreds of millions of views but
how did that even pop off in the first
place man this is a crazy story I
haven't told this one in a long time so
we edit the video and we put it on
YouTube and now like you know YouTube
that in 2012 didn't push out videos for
you like I come from the age where you

[07:02]
you like I come from the age where you
have to do distribution yourself for
your content and and so I'm like how am
I going to make this go viral and it was
really up to me and so I'm just like all
right first night I'm just going to like
okay what do I know Reddit and I posted
it on the on the video subreddit one of
the biggest subreddits on on Reddit
maybe like the biggest one and if you
don't know what Reddit is it's like the
biggest Message Board it's responsible
for some of the biggest memes on the
internet but I put it on the videos
which is for viral videos subreddit and
it has no views at the time and then I
go out to the club because I got to work
and then like three hours later I'm like
oh yeah I should check on how our video
did and so I open up Reddit and I'm on
some like rooftop club there's people
surrounding me I'm there with all my
friends and I see it's at number three
on the video subreddit and I'm like oh
snap and I start telling people around
around me because we all know what
Reddit is and and people start gathering

[08:01]
Reddit is and and people start gathering
around around my phone to see this and
and then we watch it over the night
crawl from like 3: to 2: to 1 and then
it does the same thing on the front page
of Reddit like there just like all these
people surrounding me and my phone were
all cheering and it gets to number one
on Reddit and then from there just
because I posted it on Reddit and you
know like uh I hadn't I was active on
Reddit at the time so I had an aged
account that was a genuine account I
didn't know anything about gaming Reddit
now I I can't really say whether I do or
not but we do we we do yeah so then it
was number one on Reddit and it just two
days later we were
on I think it was good morning America
we were on GMA and oh man there was this
huge music star there who we met it
wasn't Beyonce who was it I can't
remember maybe it was Beyonce I don't I
don't know it was a long time ago and
yeah and then just from that Reddit post
it took on a life of its own and then it
got super copied all these people did

[09:00]
got super copied all these people did
like fake Barack Obama walks through
Time Square fake Justin Bieber walks
through Time Square someone literally
did another fake celebrity like pranks
NYC like it just got super copied and
that was this like super viral video
that still sometimes goes viral today
that's amazing did anything come from
that we almost got a TV
show and like if I knew what I know now
I would have just figured out what do
these TV Executives want to hear and
then I would have told them that I would
have written it down and told them that
but I didn't know that and so we just
tried to come up with this re these
really crazy creative ideas which was
not what they wanted maybe we could have
pulled them off once we got the TV show
but we didn't get the TV show and then
we were
demoralized and you know we were dumb
kids we we we had like no
idea but it I mean I learned a lot I I
learned a lot about the internet and
about making things go viral so that was
cool it's funny how some of those things

[10:00]
cool it's funny how some of those things
change based on algorithms and a lot of
the other more first principle things
stay the same right based on human
nature yeah oh for sure we had a we have
we had like a good hook we did this like
one minute introduction in the video
where Brett walks where Brett like talks
about being a normal dude maybe it's
like even like 30 seconds and Brett's
like look I'm just a normal dude and I I
all my life I've wanted to be famous
here's how I'm going to pull it off and
then like next thing you know he's
walking out the entrance oh I didn't
tell you I forgot the story my gosh I
can't believe I forgot the story we put
it on YouTube I put it on redit it's
climbing on Reddit and then it gets
flagged and taken down off of YouTube
because it's using it's using a
copyrighted song Hollywood Swinging do
you know that song I think
so we Ed that song for the video but
it's copyrighted and it gets taken down

[11:00]
it's copyrighted and it gets taken down
off off YouTube and Brett is a master
this is why Brett is head of events at
Forbes because he does things like this
and he calls the record label and he
gets put in touch with an operator of
course and he's he like figured out who
he needed to which executive he needed
to speak to he's like I need to speak to
this
person and the operator was like he he
can't speak and who are you and and
Brett just like made something up just a
complete lie and Brett like knew what to
tell these people I actually got it
twisted no the operator meant to put him
on hold but clicked the wrong button oh
and put him right through to the
executive and so Brett has his chance to
speak to the executive but so now
Brett's on the phone with the executive
and he's like listen we made this video
we use your song it's going really viral
executive thought it was so funny and
and Brett's like can you just like
message whoever at YouTube and like let
us put the video up and the executive's
like all right and you know Brett's this
kid at the time and then the the video

[12:01]
kid at the time and then the the video
goes back up on YouTube as it is
climbing on Reddit and if it wasn't for
that like the video might not have gone
viral and and like Brett had to hustle
in this like moment of crisis with not a
lot of
time and I didn't find that I didn't
hear about that until like days later
that is so amazing like 99% of people
that happens to and they're like d that
sucks man dang it oh well all right well
let's focus on Facebook you know they
just move on from it and write it off
nowadays YouTube has tools where you can
swap out the music without having to
edit the video right but I'm sure that
didn't exist back then no no no there a
great story so like he needed a little
bit of luck the operator had to press
the wrong button D we had a lot of luck
Paparazzi most of the paparazzi didn't
show up but one brought all of her
friends yeah and then the video was
taken down and Brett knows Brett knew
how to talk to the operator so that she
wouldn't hang up immediately but yeah
she meant to click hold and
transferred Brett by accident that's

[13:02]
transferred Brett by accident that's
amazing then what Brett did is so as we
were going on to TV shows Brett knew how
to like leak things to press in ways
that sounded official and Brett was like
really good at at understanding that
language and so he would like leak news
that like Brett Cohen is walking out of
like the TMZ offices or something and
then he would actually get paparazzi
waiting for us in front of these offices
to take photos of us that's amazing yeah
cuz we were like the hot thing at the
time but you know we had like we had no
idea what to do with that too bad fake
it till you make it yeah that's thing
Edward you you're an idea guy like I am
so what ideas are you seeing out there
dude I have crazy things to share one of
these is it's meetups it's like creating
meetups for your
industry but more specifically and
something that I'm especially interested
in now is private Equity meetups because

[14:01]
in now is private Equity meetups because
private Equity is super price and
sensitive so did you you read my
newsletter I think it was called
grayscale it was white hat link building
getting backlinks for your website which
increases your SEO domain Authority
which allows your website to rank higher
in Google I listened to this podcast on
my first million with this guest Jesse
puie I think I'm pronouncing his name
right and he was in private equity
and he learned that
like big PE firms are paying just so
much money for very basic digital
marketing research and expertise and
like I heard one of these things and
he's like yeah like some private Equity
Firm paid like
$50,000 for this SEO analysis that would
personally take me 15 minutes and and
he's he's just like man they're so price
insensitive but
like you know I I would be lying if I

[15:01]
like you know I I would be lying if I
made it out to be this like Green Field
which is just so easy to get into
because it's not you really need to have
connections in PE so how do you get
these connections and so a few weeks
before hearing about about how price and
sensitive PE is especially with like
digital marketing or research I had put
out this newsletter about white hat gray
hat and black hat link building getting
links to your website the white hat one
was using the Meetup technique and so
the Meetup technique is and you can do
this remotely from anywhere but it would
work better if you're in the right City
but you can still do it from
anywhere and so meetup.com if you want
to have your own Meetup of over 50
people you need to pay Meetup if you
have an annual plan it's like
$172 a year and if you don't have an
annual plan you divide that by 12 and
then multip it by two and that you're

[16:00]
then multip it by two and that you're
paying like a lot per month and lots of
people they will start meetups and then
like they get bored of Hosting them and
running them and they don't want to pay
the Meetup fees and so they abandon
their
meetups Chris you know what happens when
a Meetup organizer abandons their Meetup
I do because I read your newsletter but
please tell us what happen no no tell I
want to hear I want to hear because I
want to drink Meetup Meetup does not
want to lose that juicy Mr or ARR so
they would love for anyone else to take
over the group or else they don't get
paid anymore which creates a good
incentive for enterprising entrepreneurs
like us exactly and so so everyone who's
in the group gets an email the organizer
of so and so meetup group is stepping
down would you like to take it over and
actually I think with I'm not I'm not
certain of this but there's a chance
that with the new newest version of
Meetup you can actually see groups just
in your area that are also in need of
organizers but I'm not sure at the very

[17:00]
organizers but I'm not sure at the very
least if you are in any meetup group
that has lost an organizer you can take
it over you literally can take it over
all the hard work that somebody spent
building a Meetup getting people to this
Meetup you can just it'll be your Meetup
and actually once you take it over they
can't take it back the original people
who started it they can't take it back
that happened to me once I took over a
Meetup and then the group was like we
did this by accident we didn't mean to
step down because it was a Meetup in my
Niche I got the the invitation for
meetup and I'm like I want this and I
CED it and then they're like we didn't
mean we didn't mean that and I'm like
listen let let me be an organizer of
this and then I'll just give it back to
you and they're like okay and then they
they let me just be like an honorary
organizer and then occasionally I would
use that like for my own purposes to
announce events couple questions do you
do you have to be in that group to get
that notification well so I'm not sure
if the newest the new newest version you

[18:00]
if the newest the new newest version you
can actually if you go to meetup.com
right now you might see meetups that are
in need of organizers so many meetups
now that I'm not sure if it's just I'm
seeing these notifications on meetup.com
because I'm part of that Meetup or
because they're actually showing it to
like people who aren't even part of
meetups but it would make sense like you
said they want Mr they W AR ARR and so
like why wouldn't they show meetup
groups that are in need of organizers
could one idea just to be just to Auto
jooin hundreds or thousands of meetups
and just wait for that email to
eventually come yeah totally totally
that's that's what it is so cuz it
doesn't cost anything to be a member
right cost costs nothing to join a bunch
of meetups cost nothing to join a b as
far as I know cost nothing to join a
bunch of meetups so you join as many
meetups as you want for three years when
I started doing
SEO and I was like learning how to get
clients in person I was going to New
York City Tech and business events every
night for like three years so I had to
join a lot of meetups

[19:00]
join a lot of meetups
and then like I started getting
notifications these organizers are
stepping down do you want to take this
over and when I started my own meetup
group and became comfortable hosting
meetups I'm like yeah and I took over
all these groups oh man I didn't even
tell the benefits there's so many
aspects of why this is incredible yeah I
want to know what data you get as the
organizer on the members so you can
message right away you take over a group
and you can message all of the members
you can't see their emails but when you
throw events you can like require an
email to join the event the whole idea
is like you can do this remotely and
anyone who's throwing an event most of
the time they want extra distribution
they want to make sure enough people are
going to come to their event now you
have this meetup group with several
hundred people or thousand people where
the organizer Ste down the people who
are throwing the events they don't know
how active your members are it could be
members who aren't even very active but
because you have this Meetup Group you
kind of look
a bit credible and you're just like Hey

[20:00]
a bit credible and you're just like Hey
listen I want to
co-host meetups or events in my Niche
can I be a co-host for your event and I
will just send you my
members and lots of event organizers
whether it's Meetup or Luma or whatever
they're going to say yes because they
want more people to come to their events
and then these people they can make
these people part of their events or get
their email addresses and in exchange
for this you ask them to include a blur
about your company and a link back to
your site and that blur like you're a
sponsor of their event but you don't pay
them any money you're just like lending
them your members exactly exactly it
interesting yeah exactly it and and that
blurb appears on email to everyone who
goes to the event but some like a lot of
these events have their own landing
pages and plenty of these events use do
follow backlinks versus no follow
backlinks no follow backlinks don't pass
link juice do follow back links past

[21:00]
link juice do follow back links past
like SEO link juice so they use they use
do follow back links plenty of them do
so you're you're getting awareness for
your company or whatever your brand is
you're you're getting top top mind
awareness top of funnel
awareness you're get you can get
backlinks through this and you can also
share the email list all the people who
who go to the event you can ask to share
that because you're sending members to
their event and wherever you are you can
do this with lots of different events in
your Niche and so like even as I'm
traveling through Europe when my program
comes out I'm going to just do this with
my own SEO group and just co-host a
bunch of SEO and digital marketing
events in New York City while I'm in
Europe and we just gonna have a virtual
assistant run all of it and all the
virtual assistant does is we'll use some
whatever script message Meetup hosts or
event hosts be like hey we have these
members in SEO we'd love to send them to
your event you down you don't have to

[22:00]
your event you down you don't have to
give us any money but we would like a
marketing blurb and share of the email
list whatever and so you can do this in
any Niche and how do you combine this
with private Equity first you could join
a bunch of PE meetups or Finance oh and
then also when you join a Meetup you can
also Rebrand it so if it is T if it is
like in your Niche but it's not the
exact same segment of the niche you can
change it from like the AI curiosity
Meetup to the like the New York York
City AGI curiosity Meetup to the New
York City generative AI Meetup you know
you can just change the
name and so you could take up take over
a bunch of not take over you could join
a bunch of Finance meetups wait for an
organ organizer to step down take it
over Rebrand it to a private Equity
Meetup and then do the same strategy
with PE events or you could just start a
PE Meetup too which will be harder and
that would be more of a slog but
actually I think joining a PE Meetup is
like as what you do and
if you're in the right City like you

[23:01]
if you're in the right City like you
want to try to meet people face to face
so go to events if if you can but like
look if you are co-hosting if you take
over one of these events and you were
co-hosting events in your Niche for like
a year and your company blurb is going
out for a year and you have a really you
have really good marketing language that
people are seeing it's going to help you
get your foot in the door all right if
you are watching this clip right now you
are watching this on YouTube and if you
are a fan of podcast please check out my
podcast while you're at it because
sometimes I have podcasts that aren't on
YouTube and sometimes I have YouTubes
that aren't on podcast so check out the
Kerner office on any podcast platform or
you can go to TKO pod.com also my
newsletter will throw that in there
there are no ads It's weekly it's
different content than my podcast and
YouTube newsletter. chrisj cerner.com
You'll see the link and we'll see you
there man you can could do this with
anything like any High ticket product or
anything in finance or Tech or I mean
even business owners like any business
owner Meetup just by default fa that's
more High ticket than average like if

[24:01]
more High ticket than average like if
you're selling marketing services or
agency
services and it doesn't have to be in
your city it could be worldwide it could
be in a different country and any time
I'm just like looking at my notes for
this at any time as your Meetup grows
you can also message directly all the
people in your group too because meet up
like right away once you take over a
group you can just message the members
that's brilliant sometimes I come up
with specific business ideas like for
the longest time I was obsessed with
Formula 1 because like I saw how easy it
was to grow as a Creator and I'm like
there are no smart creators addressing
the Formula 1 Niche and there's so much
money in F1 like it's where like all the
billionaires go and hang out at F1
events and then you can take that and
you can get into so many different
things you can get into sports you can
get into
automobiles man what a great Niche to be
in F1 and actually if you look at F1 on
Google Trends it's growing in in a bunch
of country I think in the US is growing
and I'm like man creators are sleeping

[25:01]
and I'm like man creators are sleeping
on F1 and actually just by talking about
this enough I I have like a bunch of F1
creators and my my one of my close
friends is now like pursuing it hard and
so I've stopped talking about it because
now I've finally gotten people to do F1
because it's like if I had time I would
love to grow in F1 and make videos in F1
and oh there's this other thing that I
believe and I call it the Curious
learner bias have you heard me talk
about this I don't think so all right
the Curious learner bias I I've heard I
learned about it first from Shan purri
on my first million but I don't know if
he used this language but basically you
don't have to be an expert to get all
the opportunities and top of- mind
awareness in your Niche you just have to
be the most passionate about it and when
you are learning you are never so
passionate about something when it is
new to you when you are learning about
it and so the theory behind the Curious
learner bias is is pick a niche that you
want to get into learn something about

[26:01]
want to get into learn something about
it every day and make a video about what
you learn every day and just as a
learner you will naturally be more
excited and you are also looking through
it through a learner's perspective and
so you don't know all the nuances that
are going to make a piece of content
like cloudy with all this extra
information that doesn't serve the the
person who doesn't even know anything
about this Niche and just by making
content every every day about what you
are learning in this Niche people will
see you as the expert even though you
are just the Curious learner and so you
get all of these opportunities and I'm
like anyone can do this with Formula 1
like they don't have to know anything
about Formula 1 my friend who's growing
on Formula 1 right now he doesn't even
have a driver's license he doesn't even
care about formula one he literally
doesn't have a driver's license he's
never seen a full Formula 1 race is it
faceless is it is it a faceless Channel
no he's using his face good he's using

[27:03]
no he's using his face good he's using
his face yeah and so the Curious learner
bias he's just learning every day about
it making he's dude he is crazy he just
decided to go full-time on this so he's
putting up like five videos a day he has
he he he has like two editors now it's
funny because I'm thinking about a guy
that a friend I have that's learning
cold emailing and email marketing he's
learning all the skills he's like all
right I'm going to take a year maybe
I'll start an agency maybe I'll just
start a company that grow with cold
emails but he's learning and I've been
helping him and he's learning learning
learning and I thought based on what you
just said I'm thinking how interesting
would it be if he just like made a
60-second video every day like all right
and maybe what he's saying is super
basic right I just learned that subjects
really matter I just and then the next
day I just learn that that a shorter
subject line is better and then and like
to people like me and you it's like this
is so basic but that doesn't matter
because the algorithm is going to find
people that are on his level or below it
and they'll watch him like come up and

[28:00]
and they'll watch him like come up and
no not even that it'll it could even be
Advanced people who want to be reminded
of the fundamentals actually when you
said like a shorter subject line does
better I'm like oh yeah I should make a
video about that it does yeah yeah every
time it's true it's basic it's true it's
basic and it's it's like like even
experts like to be reminded of the
basics and then by the time he's ready
to take on clients like you said he will
have done all these videos and he'll
have an audience they're going to trust
him yeah even if he has an audience of a
thousand people they're going to it's
that's a thousand people that trust him
implicitly and know exactly what he's
about yes yes and the crazy thing and
just like as someone who's very good at
SEO and makes a lot of SEO content I
will see people watch my videos put
their spins on on on my video not
understanding it and they put out
content that's wrong but they'll have a
better hook and their videos will get
like hundred of thousands of views
whereas like my video got tens of

[29:00]
whereas like my video got tens of
thousands just because they had a better
hook on it and and then like people even
if their information is wrong lots of
people don't know and then they they get
lots of views and so like what I'm
trying to say is like when you are
learning about something Sean Pur said
it's about energy transference and when
you are learning about something if you
transfer good energy and you have a good
hook and the subject matter is
interesting I'm not advocating putting
out
misinformation but the truth is you
might think you know something you make
a video about it it goes viral 6 months
later you realize it was wrong but it
still went viral and people are looking
at you as an expert in that and it's
just like put out share what you are
learning the less accurate you are maybe
the the greater likelihood of it going
viral because nothing goes viral without
half of people thinking you're an idiot
period that's kind of true unfortunately
you got to get over it
don't delete haters in my comments I

[30:00]
don't delete haters in my comments I
actually when I get haters I'm like
great like like like it's kind of funny
to me people will leave me such nasty
comments on my videos not realizing that
they're making my videos get more views
yeah sometimes I troll them and I I I
reply to them and I say thank you for
the engagement thank you for doing your
part thank you I've been tempted I've
been tempted to do that I I like man
sometimes my comments just get so nasty
I can't even look at them I know it gets
bad it's it's crazy like why are you
want to put so all these people I just
want to tell them like hey I can I can
see this I'm here I can read this I have
feelings you're just like hey what's
wrong let's figure this out who hurt you
yeah who hurt you so so abandoned meetup
groups I love it I'm really excited
about that here's okay here's something
else that I wish I had more time for man
and and Chris it kills me that I don't
have time for this because I see uh
Riley Brown who maybe you know he's like

[31:00]
Riley Brown who maybe you know he's like
the AI influencer he actually did the
same thing he did the Curious learner
bias he said when uh when Chachi PT came
out he made like a viral Chachi PT video
about something he was learning and he
just said I'm going to keep learning
about this and make videos about what
I'm learning and now he's like the
number one viral now he's a number one
AI influencer Riley
brown. so Riley Brown lately has been
putting out really great tutorials on
YouTube and X but especially YouTube
about how to build app applications
using AI MH and if you don't know you
can build pretty basic but monetizable
applications using cursor Claud and
repet cursor is an AI powered code
editor so it like uses AI to write your
code and you basically give it prompts
and then it writes your code and it uses
Claude to like improve its functionality
and wrate better code and Claude is just
an advanced AI model from anthropic
and then repet is a development

[32:00]
and then repet is a development
environment and it like basically as you
generate the code I haven't done this so
but like I've seen this in a bunch of
videos and rep like and I've researched
it a ton and I just I don't have time to
do everything this is one of these
things that I wish I had time to do and
then repl it as you're like making the
code it will actually make previews for
you right there and you can test out the
app that you are building and then you
can make changes on the phone on on the
Fly and so like there's a video of some
guy using these three tools together he
makes a background removal Chrome
extension in 20 minutes 20 minutes he
makes a Chrome extension to remove a
background from anything and put like
put in extra images you can also use no
code apps like bubble in fact Jason
Levan I I uh talked about him recently
he he's like huge into meme marketing
and he just came out with a SAS with a
software as a service that first it
tells you like the hottest memes to use
every day in your marketing and then it
gives you a tool for how to like put
those memes together but he made that
tool in bubble which is a no code app

[33:01]
tool in bubble which is a no code app
like app editor first of all these AI
tools are only improving and they are
improving at a crazy rate so if I had
more time I would just spend like the
next five weeks going deep on how to use
these AI tools Riley Brown he has no
coding experience and he's making all
these
applications using these AI tools zero
coding experience no development
experience so this is what I would do I
would just unbundle a feature from a big
application like I've seen that work and
i' I've done that myself with other
companies you you just take a feature
and you unbundle it and then you make
you can either do I I love SEO so I
would do bottom of funnel search engine
optimization which means creating
landing pages for addressing problems
that people are trying to solve so
people will have a problem they they
Google the solution that they are
looking for they know what they want but
they don't know the company that's going
to give it to them they are at the
bottom of the funnel they know exactly

[34:00]
bottom of the funnel they know exactly
what they want if they see a landing
page that tells them exactly they're
cash in hand if they see a landing page
that tells them like hey this is this is
what we made and uses a language that
they are searching they're they're going
to convert and even for me sometimes
like actually I needed a solution to
embed my Instagram feed on my website
and I googled embed Instagram feed on
website that's a bottom of funnel
keyword and I found us I found a company
that offered that you could do it for
free but if you did it for free they
would include their logo on the embed so
I paid $60 for an annual plan so that I
could have it branded to my website and
I converted right there I was cash in
hand I just wanted this solution I was
ready to pay because I knew what I
wanted I didn't know the brand that was
going to give it to I didn't know the
brand that was going to give it to me
and so I would unbundle a feature and
then just make Mass amounts I wouldn't
use AI to to do it because I don't like
using AI text sometimes it works but

[35:01]
using AI text sometimes it works but
eventually Google catches you and I've
seen that so many times and I would just
write like bottom of funnel landing
pages they could be like anywhere from
400 to 600 words and you can reuse
sections and I would just do bottom of
funnel SEO for this unbundled tool that
I built in like two days with AI and
then as I had more people reaching out
wanting to use it eventually what
happens is people tell you what features
and functionality they want and then you
build it listening to what your
customers and what your users are saying
and then it gets better and as you have
in these as you build this SEO funnel
now you have more daily users to play
with and you can figure out different
growth hacks to actually build into the
tool and I would just do that with AI
and the whole time also getting better
at building with AI so that's something
that I would use my time with man I wish
I had time to do that because like I'm a
build I like to build but it's like I

[36:00]
build I like to build but it's like I
can't do everything a lot of thoughts
running through my head so first of all
just the fact that anyone's going to be
able to build basically anything here
soon if not already is going to make
marketing so much more valuable and
important in distribution which I'm so
grateful for because I'm just this
degenerate marketer and I I don't know
how to code so marketing skills are
going to be in in high demand I believe
yes yes I'm think how many how many how
many background removal Chrome
extensions are there endless
right endless yeah he he who can
distribute at the best will win so
there's a thought the second thought is
I just tweeted about this idea where it
would be like a Zoom app or a zoom
plugin called stop talking where if
you're on a sales call and there's a
meter on the screen that shows the sales
person only how much they're talking as
a percentage versus the other person and
it's just like a little tool to make
sure that they're doing more listening
than talking and I tweeted about it and
a few people were like oh this app
called fathom already does that and I
look up fathom and fathom has like a
zillion features and that's one of them
and it works really well and so it's

[37:00]
and it works really well and so it's
like okay great they validated the
market let's unbundle that now that
doesn't scare me away in fact that's
quite good right and then I was thinking
as you were talking is what Frameworks
could you use to find those features
that are prime time for unbundling and
what if you went to Capa and you just
scraped like you took a software like a
massive software like HubSpot or
something or a pipe drive and you scrape
all of the reviews you run them in chat
GPT and tell me like what features do
people really love like obsess over
because a lot of these softwares are you
know $200 a month and they have this
oneoff feature that everyone uses it for
they're not using it for the CRM they're
using it for this one little widget and
so what is that one little thing that
you could peel off there's got to be a
systematic way of finding those things
to unbundle you know the thing is though
like I actually don't even think it like
that's a great idea but I don't even
think it matters much because I'm so big
with like like I've talked about now

[38:00]
with like like I've talked about now
before like just sticking with something
and developing it and growing it that I
think like anything can be grown into
something huge and as long as the right
marketers and like right operators are
behind it you'd rather have a bigger
Title Wave than a smaller right yeah for
sure for sure that's that's a really
good idea I didn't even thought I didn't
even think of that so yeah like what
what would be a good system for finding
the best idea to start with and yeah
seeing a feature that everyone in like
HubSpot uses that makes a lot of sense
that's really cool I mean how spots
obvious it's a$ billion company but any
random tool that has more than one
feature you could do this with you know
I think a lot of times companies feature
creep happens and they release all these
little features and they think that
certain ones are going to be the best
the most in demand and then that oneof
thing that took an hour to develop is
what everyone actually pays $20 a month
for and I'm very interested in peeling
that one off you want to hear a
story so there's this uh website it's
called stag
.io beautiful web app it is literally

[39:02]
.io beautiful web app it is literally
just a timer app but is beautiful looks
nice it can be used in a variety of ways
the the guy who makes it this guy Lucas
he's an indie hacker really cares about
making it just cool he even has like up
he has a notion it look I thought it was
Trello but it's notion and it's just
like features that I decided not to work
on features that I've completed features
that are upcoming features that I'm
current working on so he shows what's
coming he cares about this thing when
you look at the footer you can tell he
cares about it but at the end of the day
it's a freaking Online Timer app
literally you can Google like three
minute timer and Google will make that
timer for you timers I use Siri I say I
tell I say hey Siri timer five hours
Siri actually just did it right now but
there's all these other online time
wraps there's one website it's called
online timer.com there's all these
online time wraps and if you actually go
to the middle of his page he created all

[40:01]
to the middle of his page he created all
of these bottom of funnel SEO landing
pages and it says online timer for orts
Studios education
gyms and dude he has tens of thousands
of dollars mrr from the strategy so many
lessons to be learned here but to me
it's just like this guy goes to a Meetup
and tells his friend about what he's
building and they're like are you
kidding me everyone does that for free
why would you build that and it just
doesn't matter it doesn't matter right
like Google Calendar came out with a
cenly killer cen's they're going to be
fine they have different I still use I
still use cly yeah they have I want
people are embedded with it they don't
want to switch there's like they're
still growing like there's so much room
out there for everyone for every damn
idea that's it that's it yeah people
like I can't stand it when people think
that the pie is small because the pie is
huge yeah the pie was small before the
internet I agree but now there's you

[41:00]
internet I agree but now there's you
know you could sell to 8 billion people
yeah and these people search and you can
take this SEO strategy you can do it in
a bunch of different languages and
English is the most competitive language
too so you can literally just do it in a
bunch of like that's good point bottom
of funnel SEO like okay so that's what
my product is about I just say my
product compact keywords. comom if you
want to learn about all you want to
learn all about bottom funnel SEO
literally the landing page designed not
to be a sales page to but to be an ed
educational page about what bottom of
funnel SEO is you might understand it
right away and you don't even need to
get the program but yeah bottom of
funnel SEO is the best SEO and every
Niche it works in every niche in every
Niche there are people who want
something but they don't know the brand
that is going to give it to them and
they are going to Google trying to
figure that out and these keywords the
thing about these keywords top of funnel
SEO is competitive right now like the
SEO world was like flipped on its head
because Google decided to give all the
top of funnel queries what is how is

[42:00]
top of funnel queries what is how is
like how does a microphone work who was
Abraham linking Mary
to why did he get shot all those things
all the like how like
recipes a lot of these keywords these
top of funnel keywords that don't have
any like transaction intent behind them
these went to to Reddit to quora and to
other user generated content sites and
the reason for this is because lots of
web Masters were loading websites with
AI generated gibberish and just BS and
Google is like okay we can't trust
websites anymore but Reddit like has
this voting system and this commenting
system and same with quora and it makes
us a lot more likely to actually like
Source good information for the users of
Google so Google was like Reddit has all
of this and makes it all a lot more
likely and so now Google is prioritizing
user generated content in in search in
fact Reddit last year ranked like 70 to

[43:01]
fact Reddit last year ranked like 70 to
80 in terms of like in terms of like
market share for clicks on Google and
now it's number three it is the third
most visited site from Google on the
it's like the third most clicks yeah and
because Google is sending like all this
traffic to Reddit now because it's
prioritizing user generated content it's
so crazy that people are even putting in
their own Forums on their websites
because Google likes user generated
content it's the same thing I this is
something that I I wanted to talk about
YouTube shorts really easy to rank on
Google for keywords using YouTube shorts
take your keyword and actually top of
funnel keywords work with YouTube shorts
because YouTube shorts are user
generated content and it has some sort
of like voting mechanism which which
Google wants to see and it has comments
it has it has it has thumbs up and and
thumbs down take your keyword like the
thing that people search into Google
that's a keyword take that put it in
your at the beginning of your YouTube
short in the title and at the beginning
of the description take whatever the

[44:00]
of the description take whatever the
transcript is for your YouTube short and
then make that also the description for
it and and now you can rank for keywords
in like literally a day which I which I
do every week with YouTube shorts you
can rank for keywords in a day with
YouTube shorts actually what you can do
is like let's say you have a brand and
you're trying to figure out how to get
customers to it and you have a bunch of
competitors just do this here's your
keyword competitor plus the word
alternative competitor plus alternative
and you just pump out a bunch of YouTube
shorts about like how your how your
brand is an alternative to all these
different competitors and then these
YouTube shorts rank for these keywords
yeah and people think to do that with
blog articles but not with YouTube
shorts yeah exactly and it actually also
works really well with blog content but
it's more competitive just because
written content is more competitive and
Google is so highly prioritizing user
generated content right now yeah man all

[45:00]
generated content right now yeah man all
right you brought the heat Edward thank
