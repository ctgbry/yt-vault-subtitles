[00:00]
Some of this stuff for just reselling.
You don't have to spend any money.
Seasonal arbitrage can make you rich. I
click over to Target and there it is.
They sell it for $250. Your cost per
item is $3.78.
&gt;&gt; Wow.
&gt;&gt; You can do these deals every single day
with this method. This is how you make
$100,000, right? No doubt about it.
&gt;&gt; Something that almost no one thinks to
do is to list stuff before you have it.
&gt;&gt; Buy with math and sell with emotion. I
want to sell iPhones. No, you don't.
There's no money in it. I want to sell
sneakers. That's tough to make it. Go
find the boring stuff that other people
ignore. We are surrounded by
opportunity. I'm going to show you how
to buy those products here in a couple
minutes. It's crazy.
You can spend, you know, literally a few
hundred to get involved in this stuff
and learn how it works. And some of this
stuff for just reselling, you don't have
to spend any money. We have a member
that is he's a weatherman actually up in
up north and he picks up free couches
from Facebook Marketplace, takes them
home, cleans them up in his garage,
takes better photos and everything, puts
them back out in his driveway and sells

[01:01]
them back out in his driveway and sells
them, you know. So he he does nothing no
investment but his own time and he's
super excited about it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I've I've posted about it. This
guy Mike, he's amazing. And uh you can
just conjure income out of just your
time and your willingness to push the
boundaries, right?
&gt;&gt; Yes. Well, I'm about to share my screen
and show you this picture here that I
took in Utah. I was filming a video.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Was filming a video about
appliance rentals on Facebook
Marketplace where we got two
videographers. We're walking down the
street. We're talking about business and
I I look over as they're filming and I
see this couch in the front yard and if
you're if you're only listening, it just
says free with duct tape on it in the
middle of the cushion.
&gt;&gt; And I'm just like, we need to film on
that couch. Yeah,
&gt;&gt; that would be an awesome album cover,
first of all.
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.
&gt;&gt; And that could be your first flip. You
can make
&gt;&gt; That could be it.
&gt;&gt; You can make 200 bucks easy.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. We sat there for a half hour and
had one of our segments just broing down
on the couch about flipping appliances.

[02:00]
on the couch about flipping appliances.
&gt;&gt; And especially if you're like I was
talking about this this young guy
Tristan who bought this he bought this
truckload of flat pack brand new flat
pack furniture. He reached out and said,
"Okay, what do you think? You know how"
and it was a small investment. I think
he paid less than $4,000 for the entire
truck. this is 300 pieces of furniture.
And I said, "Where do you live?" He
goes, "Well, I live here." And I said,
"Well, you're right in between two
colleges." And they're getting, you
know, it's July, so this is perfect
timing to start talking to parents. Get
into Facebook Marketplace. Get into
Facebook groups. There's a, you know,
group called Flown and Grown that's all
about kids going away to college. So,
&gt;&gt; it's just perfect, man. Like, the couch
thing. I always tell everybody, I think
I've said it on this show, you know, if
if you live in a college town, you
should be in the couch business because
every kid and every house and every frat
and sorority, they're constantly
churning couches over and over and over.
So, just a great It's right in front of
you.
&gt;&gt; Beautiful.
That's right. All right. Well, what has
been catching your eye on
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Let me share my screen. I want to

[03:01]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Let me share my screen. I want to
show you some Okay, here we go. So,
Target is an interesting company to buy
from. I don't look at them all the time,
but when I see brand new stuff I really
like, that's kind of that's cool. And I
go down, I said, "Okay, what's this
selling for?" Target's telling us the
MSRP is about $11,000. Okay, so that's
not true, but we know that they put that
there. But the first thing that caught
my eye is this first line. Number one,
the auction's sitting at $525,
okay, right now. And it's going to
close, three hours. So yeah, it's going
to go a little bit more, but I predict
that it sells for less than a thousand
bucks because I've seen these before.
&gt;&gt; First of all, what makes you even want
to click into sporting goods in the
first place? I like just because of your
history or why
&gt;&gt; I'm curious about them and it and it's
so I go to Target, they have tons of
stuff, you know, everything that sells
at a Target, but right now this time of
year, sporting goods kind of great.
Outdoor stuff, what do they have? I just
curious to look at what it is and you
know where it's at. This is five
pallets, new condition, unsold
merchandise. So you get all this in

[04:00]
merchandise. So you get all this in
there. Unsold merchandise, no signs of
use. This is really important.
&gt;&gt; So not returns.
&gt;&gt; They're not returns. We're going to I'm
going to show you some returns in a
minute. But the So as I was just kind of
scrolling around, the first thing that
caught my eye was this 10x6 rigid air
dock and Target says they sell for 250
bucks. So a lot of times they lie, but I
just like I click over to Target
&gt;&gt; and there it is. They sell it for $250
and it's one of those floating rigid
docks like if you have a lake and a
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
&gt;&gt; Right. That kind of and stuff, you know,
we're in the middle of July. Great time
to sell it.
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; You know, if you can get it here, $250.
And right now, your cost per item is
$3.78.
&gt;&gt; Wow.
&gt;&gt; So, if you buy
&gt;&gt; 999% off,
&gt;&gt; correct? And this is Yeah. I would look,
okay, if I'm gonna spend, let's say, a
thousand bucks on this,
&gt;&gt; well, how how many of these do I have to
sell at,
&gt;&gt; you know, a hundred bucks on Facebook
Marketplace and blow one up and put it

[05:00]
Marketplace and blow one up and put it
in the water and get your whole
investment back? Then you have,
&gt;&gt; yeah,
&gt;&gt; 66 pickle ball sets, trim a tree. We're
going to talk about seasonal stuff in a
minute. But then we also have this
&gt;&gt; Intex 14. This is a swimming pool, a
14x42 clear view swimming pool that
target sells for $450,
&gt;&gt; right? And then you got 40 rollic play
tunnels for your kids that you know
&gt;&gt; how fast that pool would go on Facebook
Marketplace right now.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Today, right? That's right. So
that's what
&gt;&gt; my gosh.
&gt;&gt; It's finding things. Everybody wants
like, oh, I want to sell iPhones. No,
you don't. You know, there's no money in
it. You know, I want to sell this. I
want to sell sneakers. that's tough to
make it, you know, go find the kind of
boring stuff that that other people
ignore. So, take a look at this. I love
this deal and I love the brand new. I
love outdoor products. I love that it's
got a manifest so I can go through down
and go through every single item. I love
that there are 30 high ticket items that

[06:00]
that there are 30 high ticket items that
I can sell a portion of those quickly to
get my investment back. I'm always
focused on, especially when you're just
starting, the question in your head
should be how do I get my money back,
not how much profit I'm going to make.
Because you're going to learn all these
lessons. You're going to learn about
Facebook Marketplace. You maybe learn
about eBay. You're going to learn about
shipping and logistics, and you're going
to make mistakes.
&gt;&gt; So, you're just like, "All right, what's
on this list?" Oh, well, these these
10x6 Rigid Air. And boy, I got this one
swimming pool that's a 14x42 pool, brand
new. It's amazing. It's a great deal.
You know what I've noticed? Do you
remember last time you were on the
podcast, I talked about how I had all
all these Tesla credits.
&gt;&gt; And so I was buying stuff from tesla.com
and selling them on Facebook
Marketplace.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; It's so interesting what you learn when
you do that. Like just when you list
stuff just to see what the demand's like
&gt;&gt; because I listed like five things before
I ever bought anything. And the the
hottest thing I listed was a the wall
charger like your standard Tesla. I

[07:01]
charger like your standard Tesla. I
think they're like $450 that people put
in their garage to charge their Tesla
level two charger.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; What was very interesting about that is
you can only get those from online,
right? Like no one's going to drive to a
Tesla store to buy it. So they're $450
and then you pay $100 in shipping and
then you pay 8% sales tax. So you're
looking at 600 bucks and I was able to
sell those for $450 $500. And like I
sold I could have sold 20 of them if I
had them because there was so much
demand,
&gt;&gt; right? So, what's also interesting, and
you don't want to do this in your
research, but often times you can sell
it for more than what you expect if it's
a hot item simply because like your
house is closer to their house than
Target or you don't want to pay Target
8% sales tax or you don't want to pay
shipping or you don't want to wait for
it. Maybe you maybe you pay the
equivalent of what it costs at Target
with the sales tax and with the
shipping, but you don't want to wait
three or four days. So, you'll go drive
to pick it up, right?
&gt;&gt; Absolutely. So, I'm not suggesting that
people bake that into their research,

[08:00]
people bake that into their research,
but have you ever seen that where you
list something and you're able to sell
it for closer to retail because of it's
just like in demand or it's seasonal and
you're in the season?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And and also like I had it was a
big life lesson to me when I started
this handbag selling designer handbag
experiment and I was selling it. People
were like, "Hey man, what are you doing
selling it at that price?" I like,
"Well, I thought that price was close to
the retailer." and they said, "Yeah, but
there's a two-year wait to get that
bag." And I had no idea.
&gt;&gt; So, here's how this works. I make you
free videos. I actually know what I'm
talking about. And if you implement what
I talk about, you'll make a lot more
money and have a better life. And all I
ask for in return is that you hit the
subscribe button and maybe even the
notification bell just like that. Thank
you. So, in that research, it is what is
the availability of it and popularity of
certain things. It's like, you know,
there's people that resell those little
Trader Joe bags.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Line up at the store when they release
them. And so it's it's like when you go

[09:00]
them. And so it's it's like when you go
to a restaurant and they have market
price. Well, you need to know the market
price of what you're selling and and
understand. And
&gt;&gt; the guy that runs the mini Costco store
up in Washington full of stuff, he's
like, you know, I price my shoes at like
70% of, you know, of the Costco price
and they sell every single day. and he's
got racks and racks and racks of shoes.
And so if you're not in as a competitive
market or that's a hot product or you
can sit on it, you know, one of the bags
that I had the most success with their
brand was a brand called Spray Ground
because they do limited runs and I would
buy as much as I could get my hands on
and I would just wait and then they
they're gone. They sell out and then I
would list them for sale and then you
could I would I would sell them $200
more than the retail price.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's amazing.
&gt;&gt; Oh man.
&gt;&gt; I want to show you another one. I want
to show you another one.
&gt;&gt; Let's do it. I could do this all day.
&gt;&gt; I could too. Let me show you this.
&gt;&gt; That's my favorite so far. You shouldn't
pick favorites, but I am.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Let me share this one. This is
interesting. There's a company called

[10:01]
interesting. There's a company called
Walker Edison.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; And they make flat pack furniture. And
like here's this auction. Entry tables,
chests, and more. You get a full
manifest. You should never buy anything
without a manifest because you don't
know what you're going to get. You know
exactly what the condition is. These are
brand new. They've got photos that you
can look at of the products that are all
beautiful, factory sealed. Fantastic.
You look here, it's got, you know,
everything from beds, entry tables,
four-door chest. Now, you know, they
they say it's retail 76,000. Well, the
retail price is a lie. That's just a
fact. So, I just like just cut it in
half. Just say, "Okay, yeah, let's just
say it's $35,000." And right now, the
bid is at 28.25,
$2,825.
So, this is going to sell for not much
more than that. It'll probably maybe be
three $4,000.
&gt;&gt; A 95% discount to to quote retail,
right?
&gt;&gt; Yep. You got some freight because 16

[11:00]
&gt;&gt; Yep. You got some freight because 16
pallets is almost a truckload. So, to
me, because this is in California, it'
be like 1,200 bucks. So, let's say it
sells for I guarantee it you're into
this for less than $5,000. Mhm.
&gt;&gt; And this stuff sells itself. You You get
it, you put together a sample of each
item. Now, I I would want to look at the
bed thing. This is the one that's weird.
But there's this place has there's three
or four different auctions that go on
every single day. There's chairs, TV
consoles, all kinds of stuff. But it
this stuff is not difficult to sell.
It's beautiful for Facebook Marketplace.
You build one of each. You take some
pictures. I
&gt;&gt; was just going to say that.
&gt;&gt; Yep. You take some video of you building
it. You do a time-lapse video of you
putting it together.
&gt;&gt; And
&gt;&gt; that should be the first media.
&gt;&gt; Yep. Yeah. Exactly. It's just going
quick. It's It's the same as grinding a
stump. Same thing. You kiss your eye.
They're like, "What's this guy doing?"
You stop. You look and go, "Hey, you
know, this is uh,
&gt;&gt; you know, $170 item. I'm selling them
for, you know, 90 bucks, whatever it
is." And you'll be into them for less

[12:02]
is." And you'll be into them for less
than $20. $20 an item.
&gt;&gt; It's It's the same concept as IKEA. As a
matter of fact, I would use some of that
verbiage when I was listing it. You
know, similar to IKEA or something like
that where you
&gt;&gt; I would keyword stuff it with IKEA even
though it's not IKEA because it's like
IKEA.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. This company is Walker Edison.
It's sold up on the BTO marketplace. So,
you know, you're buying it direct.
You're not buying from some middleman.
Betock is not marking anything up.
They're not cherrypicking,
&gt;&gt; which is why you need a reseller
certificate.
&gt;&gt; You need a resell permit to get it. You
can get it. I'll tell you where to get
it. Just go to shannengeene.comresale
and there's every list of every state
that you can to a link to get your
resale permit. It's easy. It doesn't
cost anything. Don't pay anybody to do
it. Anyway, so this is, you know, we've
got 32, you know, 50 some odd 60 some
odd pallets worth of this product that's
all selling at 90% off of
&gt;&gt; Wow. their store price.
&gt;&gt; 95%.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. 95%.

[13:00]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. 95%.
&gt;&gt; This is my favorite. I mean, I know
we're not done yet, but this is my
favorite. Mostly because I know that I
can lean on Facebook Marketplace for
this. This is
&gt;&gt; People go to different platforms for
different things, right? If I want to
buy a used iPhone, I'm going to go to
eBay. Yes. I'm not going to go to Amazon
or Facebook Marketplace because I'm
going to trust the seller. They're going
to have good feedback. It's small. It's
going to ship quickly. If I want to buy
a bed frame, I'm only going to go to
Facebook Marketplace. Yeah. Right.
&gt;&gt; That's right. And you could just like I
would use like the stock photos for this
and I would take my own pictures and
videos of this and say brand new like
&gt;&gt; of course
&gt;&gt; you're going to be a similar price to
the used comparables of this except
brand new
&gt;&gt; except brand new. Yeah. In the box.
&gt;&gt; So how do you when you hear 16 pallets
that's like So I like to say all right a
pallet is almost 4x4 ft.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Just about.
&gt;&gt; So 16. So we're talking like 200 square
feet. So picture like a bedroom and it's
like a big bedrooms.
&gt;&gt; You could put it in your garage if you

[14:00]
&gt;&gt; You could put it in your garage if you
had if you emptied your garage. You
could put in your garage or you could
buy a store get a storage unit, you
know, that kind of thing if you didn't
want people coming to your house. But I
mean, this is how you build. And these
are relatively, you know, it it's it's
low risk. You're investing, you know,
less than $5,000 or this there's a
couple of them $5,000. But you need to
learn your market. You know, you need to
go up and study it. It's like, oh, are
people selling this kind of product on
Facebook? What do the used stuff? Like
you said, Chris, what do the used stuff
sell for? Gee, you know, this stuff
sells for $100. I'm gonna sell brand
new. You know, that kind of thing. And
&gt;&gt; yeah,
&gt;&gt; I love deals like this be again because
no one knows about this stuff. They just
don't they're not searching for it. And
it allows you, you know, these are these
have like 19 bids, 23 bids, but these
are there's probably three or four
people
&gt;&gt; bidding over and over again, right? It's
not it's not like 25 even. So, it's
still not much. But
&gt;&gt; is there anything else on the on this
page that kind of stands out to you that
as a good or a negative indicator? Are
there any negative indications?
&gt;&gt; Well, the negative thing I thought on
that last one was the beds. I thought
that was kind of weird. Uh I I I don't

[15:00]
that was kind of weird. Uh I I I don't
know anything about bed frames, but that
seems like a slower mover versus a a
console to put a flat panel TV on. It
looks like they have one here with a
fake fireplace in it. That's cool. I'm
always wanting to buy close to me. Like
I'm not going to buy this out of Ohio
when I can buy it from California
because I'm in California. So, you
always have to keep your freight. You
know, you want to buy close to you. You
know, one of the things I do is you do
your do your study, figure it out, do
your research, build, download the
manifest that you'll get up here, which
is essentially a spreadsheet. You list
your prices of what you believe you can
sell it for, and then you back it out.
You just do it backwards. So, you say,
"Okay, if I could sell this one we were
we were looking at, if I think I could
sell it for $50,000, what can I pay?
What am I going to pay? Shipping
included everything. Okay, I'm going to
sell it for 50. It's gonna cost me
$7,000 to get here. Okay. Do you want to
do that for $43,000? You And then if
your answer is yes, go up and put your

[16:01]
your answer is yes, go up and put your
$7,000 bid in there and walk away.
&gt;&gt; Don't walk Don't watch it anymore. Don't
get emotionally involved in the bid.
&gt;&gt; You may lose that one, but next week
there'll be four more and over and over
and over. One of the things I really
like,
&gt;&gt; a lot of these auction places,
especially Costco, they close auctions
on the weekend. They always sell for
less.
&gt;&gt; So, you should be bidding on the weekend
because nobody else is. And you should
put your bid in on Friday and leave.
It's auto bid. It'll auto bid for you,
&gt;&gt; you know.
&gt;&gt; Dude, and for the love of everything, if
if you're looking at this and you see
the manifest, don't just do your math.
Go to Facebook Marketplace and try to
sell the thing. How many clicks do you
get, if any? That could prevent you from
ever buying it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. That's something
that almost no one thinks to do is to
like list stuff before you have it just
for the research purpose.
&gt;&gt; See how many clicks, how many messages.
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yes. How about we do this real quickly?
I'm going to do a little research here
on the fly.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And show what I would look for. Which
one of them has an interesting word that

[17:01]
one of them has an interesting word that
might appear or stand out?
&gt;&gt; Maybe this retan platform king bed.
&gt;&gt; Retan panled platform king bed. Let me
see. And for those that don't know,
what's called Walker Edison.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, Walker Edison. Yep.
&gt;&gt; They're trying to be like the e-commerce
only IKEA of the next generation.
&gt;&gt; And they white label a ton of their
stuff to companies like Wayfair and
Walmart, but then they also sell
directly.
&gt;&gt; So,
&gt;&gt; it's pretty smart. They're like, "All
right, IKEA's crushing it, but they're
retail. We want to be like IKEA, but we
never want to sell retail.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we don't want to store." And so
that also means that their stuff that
you're getting on pallets is like it's
well packaged to be shipped and sold
only online.
&gt;&gt; That's right.
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; Yep. You got it.
&gt;&gt; Retan panled king bed. I'm looking DFW.
I'm going to do condition new. You don't
have the luxury of doing on Facebook
marketplace is knowing you can but not
as well how much interest there is in
any given thing.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. But I'm seeing there's

[18:01]
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. But I'm seeing there's
almost nothing under $400.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; $3 to $800 for these king beds. Some of
them over a,000. New in box 550. Retan
style bed frame 500. This might be the
exact one. So if we were to let's say
conservatively we sell them for 350.
What would our profit look like on that?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Right now the cost is your cost on
that landed will be about $30.
That's crazy.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. This is And and this is every day.
I mean, it's not If you don't want to
sell beds, find that. Go do the next
thing.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; It's wild. Let me show you a bad
example,
&gt;&gt; dude. All day.
&gt;&gt; What I don't think you should buy
because it's too popular. Let's see
here. And if you're listening in, I'm
going to show you. There's a image of
this four pallets of Stanley 40
stainless steel H2.0
flow state quencher tumblers. These are
everywhere, right? I don't I every young
girl, every soccer mom

[19:01]
girl, every soccer mom
&gt;&gt; and they're Stanley's. This is and
they're brand new.
&gt;&gt; The problem is Target says they're worth
$37,800,
$45 a unit, but you do a quick search
and you see everybody sells them at 25
bucks. Maybe they're 25 because it's
this they're gray and they're not a
bright color. So they I don't know. I
don't know anything about this market.
&gt;&gt; But the bid is at $12,000 right now, not
including freight. So it they're at 1435
a unit. Well, that's that's not a good
deal. You can't pay 50% of what you find
them in selling for. You'll be upside
down on this deal. But people get
enticed. You know, I always advise
&gt;&gt; Stanley
&gt;&gt; because it's Stanley and they're
popular. I see them everywhere. That's a
bad thing to sell.
&gt;&gt; And you know, if Target is is dumping
them, what does that tell you? They
can't sell them. Otherwise, if they
couldn't get them. So there's a lot of
other reasons, but that basis is
probably pretty high because it's
Stanley. They're not a no-name brand
from China.
&gt;&gt; That's right. And so, you know, I always

[20:01]
&gt;&gt; That's right. And so, you know, I always
tell people to buy with math and sell
with emotion because if you use emotion
when you buy, the math never works. And
this is one of those deals that you
should just, oh, I'm not I can't I'm not
even going to bid on these, you know,
unless you had somebody that said,
&gt;&gt; "Hey, Chris, we really want Stanley 40
tumblers. If you ever come across them,
I can pay you 20 bucks a piece for
them." Okay. Well, that's a different
conversation. exception. Yeah,
&gt;&gt; an exception. So, you want to stay away
from these. It's not not a good
investment.
&gt;&gt; When you say sell with emotion, do you
just mean like storytelling? Like good
sales skills, enthusiasm?
&gt;&gt; Absolutely. Your story, the narrative,
why you're selling, I'm putting my kids
through college or I'm I want to pay for
summer camp for my kids or I'm taking my
family on a trip and I'm trying to earn
extra money. That should be in your
&gt;&gt; your your listings. You should be
talking more about it because people
want to buy from people
&gt;&gt; and you don't want to compete on price
if you don't have to. You want to be
competitive.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You add your story, your purpose. Why?

[21:01]
&gt;&gt; You add your story, your purpose. Why?
Everybody wants to make money. That
that's just that's table stakes.
&gt;&gt; But if you're like, I'm trying to add an
on suite to my house so I can move my
mother-in-law in in the next two year.
Well, that's great, man. People share
that. That's that's what people want to
know. People want to know about you and
what you're doing. That's what I mean.
&gt;&gt; Especially if you're in a more
competitive market or you're selling a
commodity. When I helped those teenagers
start the firewood business last year,
firewood is a commodity, right? I know
if I go to Facebook Marketplace, it's
going to be 450 accord. And so I don't
want to go 500, but I also don't want to
go 400. So instead, I went 450. And in
the title was help us pay for college.
100% of the profits go to these high
schoolers that are trying to pay for
college.
&gt;&gt; Y right.
&gt;&gt; I love it. I love it. It's It's
brilliant. Let's talk about batteries.
&gt;&gt; I love obscure deals, right? Of course,
I love to sell the sexy stuff, too, but
there's way more competition in those
markets and often less margin and

[22:00]
markets and often less margin and
there's not as big of a moat because
everybody wants to sell, you know, fancy
sneakers or Blackstone grills, that kind
of stuff. But this is a Gov deals
auction just at govdeals.com. It's a lot
of 8,000 and and it doesn't sound
exciting because it's not. It's 8000 AAA
GP Gold Peak Ultra Plus alkaline
batteries, brand new. I don't know
anything about batteries, right? But I I
I'm like, well, there's 8,000 is brand
new. It's kind of interesting. So, I
started looking at the pictures on the
boxes and the and the one thing that
stood out and I'm scrolling through
these pictures here is there's a Let's
see. I can make it a little bigger for
those on YouTube. Is this this date code
' 082031?
&gt;&gt; Okay, that's that was my next question
is like expiration date.
&gt;&gt; These batteries after just a little bit
of research, they're specifically made
to have a 10year shelf life.
&gt;&gt; That's why they're valuable. And if you
go and look at Amazon, if you search So

[23:01]
go and look at Amazon, if you search So
I I just search for that brand GP Gold
Peak Ultra. If you search on Amazon,
they're all over. If you search on eBay,
on eBay they're selling expired versions
you can buy. They sell like a 200 or 250
pack for like $50. But on the current
versions, they basically sell for about
a buck a battery.
&gt;&gt; Wow.
&gt;&gt; What it comes down to about a buck. So
two pack these are in two packs and
they're not retail packed. So when you
look at a retail pack like Amazon sells
sells them basically for like two bucks
a battery in a retail pack. So if you
look around you don't you're not going
to have a retail pack. You're not on
Amazon. and you're not going to sell it
for that much. I go through and like,
okay, what's it worth?
&gt;&gt; And so, you said these should go for a
dollar a piece. So, are we talking
$8,000 worth?
&gt;&gt; We're talking $8,000. If you have to go
buy two pack of AA batteries, what's it
cost? Four bucks or something like that.
I don't know what they are, but I know
these batteries easy. You can sell them
as a reseller for basically a dollar

[24:00]
as a reseller for basically a dollar
each. And so, you could sell whatever it
is. You sell a 10 pack for 20 bucks, a
10, you know, however you're going to.
We're not talking about the Walmart
retail price. That's unrealistic for us.
&gt;&gt; It's unrealistic. Go Yeah, you could go
You have to search, like you're saying,
you have to go to eBay. You got to
search sold listings. Got to search for
that brand. I like to look at Amazon
because they show velocity really quick
right there. And they'll say, "Oh, 4,000
orders over the last 30 days. Very
helpful." And you want to know. So, I
love this deal. Another reason I love it
is it's small. It's 8,000 pieces, but
it's only like six or seven, maybe eight
boxes that you could put in your your
bedroom or your your office, whatever it
is. So,
&gt;&gt; I love that stuff. Small things, very
inexpensive to ship if you want to sell
them online. You can put them in an
envelope, a free, you know, priority
mail envelope, so you don't have to buy
packaging. You're good to go pick them
up. These are sitting down. These are in
Gilroy, which is not too far from me.
And the other thing I love about Gov
Deals is you can ask questions. This is
me right here. So they they put they're
like, "Hey, what's the expiration date?"
And it and it said 8 2031 and then there

[25:00]
And it and it said 8 2031 and then there
was this other date 52925. So I thought
some were 2031 and some were 2025. And
I'm like what's the breakdown of the
cases? You know, a number of cases with
2031 expiration date, number of cases
with 25. And they came back and said
they all expire 2031.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; 2025 is the month we answered that
question. So you know these have been up
here for a while. I think they didn't
sell before and they got relisted,
right? because they wouldn't be sitting
here since May. But this is the kind of
deal when I stumble across them or it's
money and you can do this every day over
and over and over and it wouldn't take
you long to sell this. It wouldn't take
you obviously it's not going to take you
very long to get your investment back.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And that's a big part of the what I try
to show people is
&gt;&gt; take calculated risks but then focus on
getting your investment back, you know,
as quickly as you can. And that may mean
wholesaling some to other, you know,
shops. Maybe you walk into a hobby place
in your town and say, "Hey, you want to
buy Casey's batteries? What would you
pay me for 500 of these?"

[26:01]
pay me for 500 of these?"
&gt;&gt; So, is that the play with these to
wholesale them to a retail store?
&gt;&gt; That's what I would do.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Do people ever walk into like the
Ali's discount outlets or those dirt
cheap? There's a, you know, a handful of
chains around the country. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Is it possible to just walk in, talk to
the GM, and say, "Hey, do you want
these?" Because they could just put them
on the floor. Yeah. The key is not to
walk in with anything in your hands. The
key is to walk in and just say, "Hey,
I'm I'm a reseller. I get access to some
crazy stuff. Could I can I email and
share anything? Do you guys buy from
individuals or from other businesses?"
And some will say, "No, we do not. We
have a corporate yada yada yada." Some
will absolutely say, "Yeah, what do you
got?" And you get their contact
information. And when you get a manifest
or a list like this, you say, "Hey, you
fire off an email. You know, maybe you
bring donuts by you. You you got to
build a relationship. This is a
relationship business. And so,
&gt;&gt; yeah,
&gt;&gt; you get that network going and you you
you email and say, "Hey, John, I got an
opportunity on these brand new GP Ultra

[27:00]
opportunity on these brand new GP Ultra
batteries. Looks like 10 years. Here's
some Amazon, you know, links and eBay.
Is that something you guys be interested
in? Any idea what you might want to pay
for 500 pieces?" And you let them tell
you the price.
&gt;&gt; Well, here's what I love about this
product. So when I had my third party
logistics company, we would occasionally
inherit some just crap that some of our
customers would sell and they were never
never able to sell. Sure. And we were
forced to to liquidate it to pay for
their bills, their storage bills. I get
&gt;&gt; and I inherited a couple pallets of
these blenders imported from China. They
were like single serving blenders and
they were good quality, but like who
wants that? Like you can't sell that on
Facebook Marketplace
kind of thing that they Yeah, I can't
get it. Yeah. But with this, like if I'm
a store manager and I'm able to buy
stuff, I'm going to think, you know
what, 100% of my customers use AA
batteries. 100% of them. Correct.
&gt;&gt; And so if I'm a customer, I'm going to
walk by that and be like, you know what,
those are $4 at Walmart, $1 here. I
might as well pick up eight packs. I

[28:00]
might as well pick up eight packs. I
won't need batteries for another five
years. You got it. You know,
&gt;&gt; exact. And the fact that they last for,
you know, they're going to last for
another seven years or six years or
whatever it is, you know. So,
&gt;&gt; Yep. But that framework doesn't work for
even most products, but it does for this
because this is a commodity.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. Again, talking about
unfair advantage, I'm going to share
some Costco stuff here, liquidation
stuff in a few minutes.
&gt;&gt; If you don't live near a Costco, that's
a big unfair advantage for you because
everybody wants Costco products, right?
They did 250 billion in sales, right?
So, you can buy Costco liquidation items
and offer them in your local community
that doesn't have a Costco. Not only can
you make money, but you'll be a hero.
It's just a great product. One of the
things that makes it so valuable is that
everybody overlooks it. That's nuts. I
don't want to sell batteries. I can't
sell batteries, you know. Well, I'll
show you how. I just heard I've heard
the same thing recently from two
different world famous investors, Scott
Galloway and Manish Pabry. They both
said their best deals, their sexiest

[29:00]
said their best deals, their sexiest
deals, their sexiest investments have
been the the most unsexy industries or
businesses,
&gt;&gt; right? like maritime shipping.
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
&gt;&gt; Which is the most boring, unsexy thing
ever. And so that same framework holds
true with liquidating items.
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.
&gt;&gt; So you've probably heard me talk about
Beehive before. And if you've ever
received a newsletter from me, it was
powered by Beehive. I've been using
Beehive for the last year and a half.
Their three founders left Morning Brew
and built the platform so the rest of us
could use the same tools that turned
Morning Brew into a multi-million dollar
operation. That's why Beehive doesn't
feel like every other newsletter
platform because it's not. It was built
by people who scaled a newsletter
empire. Now, you know that I only
recommend stuff that actually moves the
needle for me. This moves the needle.
So, go to beehive.com/ris.
Use the code chris30 to get 30% off your
first 3 months. I just went to to Chad
GPT as you're talking and I said, "Tell
me the biggest metros in the US with no

[30:01]
me the biggest metros in the US with no
Costco." And I grew up in Logan, Utah.
That's in Cash Valley, northern Utah.
And there's, I think, a quarter million
people in Cash Valley, maybe more. They
didn't have a Costco until a few months
ago.
&gt;&gt; Wow.
&gt;&gt; And it's slammed. It's slammed now. Now
it's there.
&gt;&gt; I could imagine. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But dude, Waco, Texas, 280,000 people.
&gt;&gt; No Costco.
&gt;&gt; Just north of Austin, right? Like the
thought of someone in Waco driving all
the way to Austin for Costco is like
another planet. They're just not going
to shop at Costco, right?
&gt;&gt; That's right. So, if you had a small
warehouse and you had those same
products and you were on Facebook
Marketplace talking about it and you
were in parent groups on Facebook
talking about it, you would just be
inundated with people that wanted to buy
those products. And I'm going to show
you how to buy those products here in a
couple minutes. It's crazy,
&gt;&gt; dude. Here's a few more. First of all,
it told me Baton Rouge, Louisiana and
Huntsville, Alabama, but that's false.
They both have Costos. So, these have
been double checked.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh Jackson, Mississippi, biggest
city in Mississippi. No Costco. And a
lot of these are because like Costco
knows where they need to go, right?

[31:00]
knows where they need to go, right?
They're not stupid. They know what
demographics they need to support a
store, but it it doesn't mean that
there's no people there, right? Like
that would want a Costco. For instance,
there's no Trader Joe's like in my area
cuz there's just not quite enough
people. Yep. You know, but there are a
lot of people if you expand it out a
little further. Amarillo, Texas, 300,000
people. Love, Texas, 300,000 people.
Laredo, Texas, 300,000 people. And
Topeka, Kansas, 250,000 people. No
Costco.
&gt;&gt; It's huge. I mean, it's such a basic
concept that people love Costco. It's a
cult, right? I mean, they love going
there. The whole thing.
&gt;&gt; They should. It's freaking awesome.
&gt;&gt; It is awesome. It's amazing. Changed my
life. I mean, I'm telling you, sitting
in
&gt;&gt; I bet you especially
&gt;&gt; changed my life. And they're amazing
people. They are truly people that care
about everyone succeeding, which is
highly irregular in the industry. And
from a buyer standpoint or however you
want to call it, my relationship with
them,
&gt;&gt; they're one of the few companies that

[32:00]
&gt;&gt; they're one of the few companies that
won't sell you out for a dollar, you
know, y because like no, no, we sell to
Shannon and he's reliable and we've
known him for 10 years and we're going
to keep selling to Shannon. And that is
priceless, man. Priceless.
&gt;&gt; Jim Sagal, the founder, he is a
testament that you can have your cake
and eat it, too. You can treat employees
well. you can pay them very well, right?
And you can offer the lowest prices on
the market. Like
&gt;&gt; if any other company out there is
saying, "Well, we can't do this because
of the just look to Costco. It's
possible."
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And when you can sell a hot dog
and a Coke for buck 50
&gt;&gt; in like the most brutal industry,
grocery, where no one makes money,
they're making money and they're
treating their employees right and
they're beloved by all. Like,
&gt;&gt; yeah,
&gt;&gt; what are we talking about?
&gt;&gt; It's huge. It's huge.
&gt;&gt; Before you continue, another one more
quick business idea. I can't help
myself, but doing the same thing with
IKEA. There's a whole thriving industry
out there of selling IKEA furniture to
people in big enough markets that are
big enough to have a good population
center, but not big enough for an IKEA
because most markets are not big enough

[33:01]
because most markets are not big enough
for an IKEA. They're a lot more
selective. Huntsville, Alabama, half a
million people, no IKEA. I actually
started a business in when I lived in
Huntsville called My Modern South. And
that's what I did was I would load up. I
would go to the Atlanta or the Memphis
IKEA and place orders beforehand and I
would literally just say, "Go to
IKEA.com,
&gt;&gt; tell me what like fill your cart, print
out your cart. I'm going to add 30% to
it and then meet me at this grocery
store parking lot and collect all the
money up front.
&gt;&gt; You rent a U-Haul for a day. You pay by
the mile. You work that into the cost.
You show up at a parking lot. If you're
not here between this two-hour window,
I'm keeping your crap." and you just
resell it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I love it. That's it.
&gt;&gt; Okay, so here's the deal. One of the
things you do is you want to watch the
news and you want to learn about
companies that are buying other
companies because when that happens,
there's usually a large liquidation of
products because they're consolidating,
maybe they're shutting down warehouses.
In this case, we're looking at an
auction from Advance Auto Parts that got

[34:01]
auction from Advance Auto Parts that got
bought by Pep Boys, if you know them,
their big, you know, auto parts place.
And so they closed a bunch of locations
because then they merged them in with
Pep Boys locations. And they've been
liquidating auto part auto repair parts
and auto repair gear equipment tools for
like the last I'd say eight months.
&gt;&gt; And what we're looking up here, it says
truckload of ignition, emission
components, brake drums, rotors, and
more. 3,911
pieces.
&gt;&gt; Like new condition. Now, like new means
it's it's new, but the boxes may be a
little beat up because it got moved
around from warehouse to warehouse.
They're not store returns, all that kind
of stuff.
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; Extended retail $126,422.
We know that's a lie. So, let's just say
it's worth 70, you know, or $60,000.
Okay.
&gt;&gt; What do they what do they mean extended
retail?
&gt;&gt; Oh, so unit retail is individual piece.

[35:01]
&gt;&gt; Oh, so unit retail is individual piece.
So extended is just unit retail times
the quantity.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Okay.
&gt;&gt; So that's all. So their full retail of
this manifest if you go to the bottom
they have it at 126422.
Okay.
&gt;&gt; And pretty much on all of these sites
you can look at the manifest before
bidding before buying.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Don't don't buy without a
manifest. That is rule number well rule
number one is don't buy unless you know
what you can sell it for. Rule number
two is never buy a deal unless you're
very sophisticated buyer without a
manifest because you'll have no
recourse.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Why would you even bid on an item
before looking at the manifest if it's
there for you?
&gt;&gt; There are there are people that buy like
I tell you bin store owners
&gt;&gt; don't care as much about manifest
because they're buying by the piece at a
dollar whatever it is the dollar amount.
&gt;&gt; My friend that sells shirts
&gt;&gt; they don't care. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, but for the typical seller,
don't don't do it. You'll get burned.
So, this is looking at this right now.

[36:00]
So, this is looking at this right now.
The bid's at $4,000. Okay? It's going to
close tomorrow, one day in two hours. I
guarantee you this does not close. This
bid closes for maybe $7,000. $67,000.
&gt;&gt; Okay. And if you go and look at this, if
you sort by the products and you sort by
the retail, you can just see the
numbers, you know, $1,138,
950, 730, 708, 532, on and on and on and
on. There's line item after line item
that are $200 to $1,000.
Right now, I don't know anything about
this product and I would not buy I would
not buy this because I don't know
anything about car parts. if I was in
that car parts industry business and I
could do and I knew that a speed
calibrator,
&gt;&gt; you know, really was worth a couple
hundred bucks or a quick strap assembly,
well, that would be one thing, but I
don't I would I would rather go buy the
that furniture, right? Because it's more
broad. But
&gt;&gt; these auctions at Advanced Auto have

[37:01]
&gt;&gt; these auctions at Advanced Auto have
been incredible and auto parts guys that
I've been sharing them with have just
they've just been going nuts and
scooping this stuff up for next to
nothing. Dude, I'm picturing I see all
these lists. Like if you scroll down to
the SKS and the item numbers.
&gt;&gt; To me, it's as if I'm panning for gold
and I pull my pan out of the river and I
see some shiny rocks. I see some fool's
gold. I see some rubies. I see a lot of
gray, a lot of crap.
&gt;&gt; Like what where my mind goes here is to
screenshot this stuff or to export the
manifest, upload it to Manis, which
&gt;&gt; you can download right here. Just yeah,
which Manis is like a more agentfriendly
version of Chad GBT or just Chad GBT or
Perplexi or whatever. Yeah. And say find
the gold.
&gt;&gt; Yep. Exactly.
&gt;&gt; Find the fool's gold and find the gold.
And what I want you to do and then give
it more sources like and I would do
this. I would go manually find some gold
like the leaf spring or the clutch pack.
Go try to find something that
&gt;&gt; appears to have more demand than supply
and say, "All right, I want you to go
look everywhere you can. eBay, Facebook

[38:01]
look everywhere you can. eBay, Facebook
Marketplace, everywhere. message boards,
subreddits, forums. What are the parts
that are that have more demand than
supply? For example, here's three and
here's why I know this and here's where
I found that info. Like, always give it
source data and then just wait 10, 15
minutes and
&gt;&gt; don't just trust what it tells you, but
go and look at the list of what it tells
you and go cross reference it
&gt;&gt; and then you could like then you have
asymmetric information because how many
people that are bidding or looking at
this are doing that? Shannon,
&gt;&gt; what I just described not enough. What I
recommend they do as well if they're not
comfortable digging into AI or they
don't know that those resources as well
is I'm get the manifest and go start
talking to people in the industry that
you're interested in selling and and
don't sell just say look I've got this
opportunity here's this list of new
brand new product that someone you know
advanced you tell them say advanced auto
is wants me to buy this because that's
true they want you to buy it and say is

[39:01]
true they want you to buy it and say is
this something that you're interested in
and you know they'll look at the list
and say, "Oh, it's not worth 126." Okay,
great. What is it worth? Maybe they come
back to you and say, "You know what?
This list is only worth $25,000." And
you say, "Would you buy this list if I
got it to you and I could sell it to you
for $25,000?" And then you go back and
you know, you have the answer. I don't
want to sell one things one at a time,
but I would love to buy this deal for
six or $7,000 and sell it for 25 and let
it go away. I would have the truckload
brought to my freight forwarder. I'd
have the freight forwarder strip every
identifying thing out of it of where it
came from and I would deliver it right
to the buyer and get their wire transfer
and I'd be done.
&gt;&gt; Oh man,
&gt;&gt; you do this over and over and over. This
is what you do. This is your business.
You don't stop with this. You know, you
can do these deals every single day with
this method. Every single day.
&gt;&gt; I was like googling gas leak detector

[40:00]
&gt;&gt; I was like googling gas leak detector
kit
angle grinder. I just myself.
&gt;&gt; I'm the same way. It we are surrounded
by opportunity.
&gt;&gt; I'm telling you right now.
&gt;&gt; So, let's talk about QVC and let's talk
about why July is the best time to buy
Christmas trees, right? And the second
best time to buy Christmas trees is
January, February, March. And that's
where I have a a a student in our
mastermind that he's bought so many
Christmas trees that sold for like
nothing from Costco and Target and
everything else. He's going to open an
artificial Christmas tree lot in his
town.
&gt;&gt; He's already got the spot.
&gt;&gt; Is that even a thing?
&gt;&gt; No, it's going to be this year. And so
I'm like, you know, he's going to have
this whole thing, the whole setup, and
they'll be set up and you can come pick
them up. And it's it solves the open
box, you know, conversation that
sometimes you have to have. You promote
it on Facebook Marketplace. You have
great social walking around. You you do
you have a fire going. You do
marshmallow. You the whole thing. And
you sell other stuff, too. So, what
we're looking at here, this is QVC,

[41:01]
we're looking at here, this is QVC,
just, you know, the the home shopping TV
place. They have tons of, you know, this
I don't normally look at their stuff,
but I want to talk about seasonal
selling. It's really powerful. And this
four pallets of Christmas trees by
Ebenezer and Company. I didn't know
there 158 units. new condition. Okay.
Okay. Instead of retail, retail $1,710
bucks. It's not worth that. You know,
it's probably worth five grand, six
grand. Bids at $526. And there's only
five bids because people just aren't
interested in buying this stuff.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; These are these are small trees.
&gt;&gt; 24 in 36 in little tabletop trees. You
know, they were selling for 65 and 89.
But the same concept goes with the
Costco tree that sells for 1,500 bucks
is what I'm telling you. and you want to
buy them like I don't know if you know
this Chris but there's a large amount of
people that buy a Christmas tree on
December 26th they take it back to the
store and Costco being the great
&gt;&gt; wonderful returns they just take it back

[42:00]
&gt;&gt; wonderful returns they just take it back
&gt;&gt; they take it back all these stores take
them back they don't question you they
don't want any confrontation so there's
&gt;&gt; tens of thousands of these you know
returns after the holidays it's same
goes With Halloween, what do you think
they do with their excess inventory
after Halloween? They put it up here and
they sell it. Same with every holiday,
same with Fourth of July, same with I
mean over and over. You to seasonal
arbitrage can make you rich and the time
to buy is right after or in the middle
of July where you can pick these up.
&gt;&gt; These are going to sell for less than
five bucks a piece, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And you can just sell them like crazy
once the season starts. This is another
good Facebook marketplace item.
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; dude. I My mind is just spinning right
now. First of all, with the the
Christmas tree lot idea, he if I were
him, I would just like make a call to a
farm and also sell real trees. That way,
just you can get a 100% of the market
and imagine your sign. It's like arrow

[43:01]
and imagine your sign. It's like arrow
fake those ones. Arrow real those ones.
Like
&gt;&gt; why would anyone else percentage of the
profits to the the owner of the of the
farm? And so that way you get the people
in that are just like, "Oh, I want to
buy the, you know, big fake tree or I
don't, you know, we do." Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; There's so many possibilities, man,
&gt;&gt; because it's such a unique thing.
&gt;&gt; Normally it's like, "All right, that's
kind of two different businesses. He
should focus." But it's like these
Christmas tree farms know the
assignment. They're just going to drop
off trees like they do at their other
retail customers. It's just going to sit
there like the fake trees. You're going
to swipe the same card. Like you might
as well capture 100% of the market. The
other thought I had is I love this one
because there's no question marks for
me. Like as someone that's a total
novice to this
&gt;&gt; with the Stanley's, it's like, "Oh, oh,
there's alpha here. I'm going to make
some money." And then you buy it and you
go to sell it and 100% of people are
like, "I don't want gray. Gray's ugly.
Gray's ugly. Gray's ugly." And it's
like, that's why I got these at a
discount cuz nobody wants them. But with

[44:01]
discount cuz nobody wants them. But with
with anything seasonal, it's like I
don't need to worry if I'm making the
worst mistake of my life. It's July.
They oversold or they overbought and
they didn't sell them.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. You're going to spend less than a
thousand bucks for four pallets on and
on. I mean, there's the reasons just
keep stacking up, right? And
&gt;&gt; dude, I want to buy these.
&gt;&gt; I have my kids sell them.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Exactly. Every every morning I
wake up and I come in here and I pull a
piece of printer paper out and I get a
pen and I write my kids chores for the
day. Yeah. And usually half of those
chores are today it was sell the Oculus
Rift 2, sell my Aura Ring, sell this.
And that's like it's I put that right
next to vacuum your room. And it's not
because like I'm really trying to
encourage entrepreneurship like I am,
but we just need stuff sold and I don't
want to do it right. And they could they
get to keep 40% chance. That's huge.
Like
&gt;&gt; that's huge.
&gt;&gt; I'm pretty generous. Okay. But with this
we can make it more of a business
&gt;&gt; of course and you know youth is a huge
unfair advantage. People love to buy

[45:00]
unfair advantage. People love to buy
from young people and to help them out.
And if you're walking around selling
&gt;&gt; two and three foot Christmas trees at at
sell them at 20 bucks, right? You know
how many moms would buy a $20? I mean, I
don't know. You go to TJ Maxx or
wherever you have around here. This
stuff sells like crazy. Sells like
crazy. So, anyway, I love seasonal
deals.
&gt;&gt; Quick question. What if there were a
private community out there of people
that were building businesses based on
this podcast? Well, I just made it and
it's only for business starters and
business builders. It's called TK owners
and it's basically like having me and a
hundred other business geniuses as your
business partner, but you give them 0%
equity. Also, there's going to be
exclusive new trends, growth hacks,
business ideas, and a database of
everything I've ever talked about.
You'll find thousands of startup case
studies. You'll have weekly ask me
anything with me while I'll answer your
questions directly. You'll be in my
Slack channel where I'm hanging out
every week and helping members
one-on-one. We've got exclusive guest
speakers including some names that
you'll recognize. And if you're building
something cool, I'll introduce you to

[46:00]
something cool, I'll introduce you to
anyone you need. TK Owners is the
fastest way to plug into a smart,
ambitious group of builders and
accountability partners that are sharing
wins without the fluff. And it's 99
bucks a month, about the cost of an
energy drink per day. You can join now
at tkowners.com. Link in the show notes.
Another idea I had with the auto parts
or with anything, you go to the
liquidation site, you see everything
listed out in a list format and let's
say it says Advance Auto, it says
Costco, it says whatever. Screenshot all
of those company names. Drag it over to
Chat GPT and say, I want you to find any
news from the last 6 to 12 months of any
of these companies either buying or
selling another company.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, like Dick's Dick Sporting
Goods, they just bought Foot Locker.
&gt;&gt; And so immediately,
&gt;&gt; nobody would know that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I get unless you went and look for
it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I get in the mastermind and I'm
like, "Okay, sneakerheads, get ready."
You know, they're coming. And sure
enough, here come the Foot Locker
auctions and they did a test run and
they sold, you know, I don't know, few
thousand pairs of shoes and now they're

[47:00]
thousand pairs of shoes and now they're
going to, it worked out good for them
and now they're going to be selling them
the whole time. It's crazy. Let's talk
about Legos.
&gt;&gt; Legos are nuts, dude. And Star Wars is
crazy, too.
&gt;&gt; It's a good investment, too, if you hold
on.
&gt;&gt; This is what this is an investment. So,
this is a little different product
because these are in, you know,
investment grade type things. And one
pallet of Lego Star Wars Grou Baby Yoda
with hover pram set, new condition, 140
sets, retail $11,199.
Okay. I I don't I don't know whether
that's true or not. The one thing I do
love about Costco, they don't discount.
Typically, they're already a discount
place, so you can trust that number a
lot more. Costco's typically still
selling it. Now, the bid is high here
because they're very popular and people
know this market. So, the bid sitting at
6,225 bucks,
&gt;&gt; so it's not like a grand slam
&gt;&gt; right now. However,
&gt;&gt; well, Lego sexy, right?

[48:00]
&gt;&gt; well, Lego sexy, right?
&gt;&gt; Lego sexy. So, you you know, you really
have to know this market. I wouldn't be
I would not advise anyone to buy this
that doesn't know the market. I'm going
to click on some of these bigger
pictures. Here they show the inside
little extra stuff. Here's the rack.
Here's the whole thing. You're going to
get the whole display and everything
that Costco had in their store that it's
Lego big thing. That's probably worth
money, too.
&gt;&gt; Here's the box.
Just showing you that kind of stuff,
&gt;&gt; dude.
&gt;&gt; Now, you know what idea just came to
mind? Sorry.
&gt;&gt; Yes. No, go ahead. Like if you were to
specialize in buying stuff like this,
this would sell so well uh on like
Instagram with short form video. Watch
me unbox this Lego palette. Watch like
people eat that up and then you could
you could sell it to the people
watching.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, of course. Live selling, man. It's
amazing. Yeah, eBay has it now, too. So,
no, don't apologize. I love I could eBay
has a live selling, Poshmark has it,
everybody. It's it's what not the whole
nine yards. So, you would want to do
some research because most of these LEGO
buyers, they buy and they hold, right?
Because they want to see the value. The

[49:00]
Because they want to see the value. The
scarcity impacts the value. They want to
wait until the holidays where the kid
says, "Dad, I want the Star Wars Grou
baby Yoda with hover pram. I got to have
it." And nobody has it. They're all sold
out in the stores. So, they're not 80
bucks. They're $1.99 on eBay. You know,
that kind of thing. Now, I don't know if
this Lego in particular it has that type
of arc, but you could easily find out
and go look and study. And there are
people on X that just focus on Lego and
they're happy to connect with you. I
posted stuff on X. If you're on X, this
just my name, Shannon Jean. And I posted
stuff on X and all the Lego people come
in and they'll say, "Well, here's why
the Lego flowers aren't so great." Or
here's why this or yeah, that's a good
one. And then you then there's a couple
of guys that are, you know, very well
known in this market and they do they do
great. They'll give you their advice so
you can get lots of tips.
&gt;&gt; What do you think this thing sells for?
This Grego Baby Yoda.
&gt;&gt; I bet you it sells for it's 2 hours and
38 minutes left. If I was buying with

[50:01]
38 minutes left. If I was buying with
math, I would have put my max in. I
wouldn't even look at it anymore. But
there are people that will not do that.
They'll bid at the end. And this is
popcorn bidding. What I mean by that is
they'll extend it by 2 minutes if
somebody bids in the last minute. So,
there's no sniping here. And like on
eBay, you can use a sniper and you can
buy at the last 10 seconds and win
stuff. And that's really truly the best
way to get good deals. But here, you
can't do that. You're smart. I think it
sells for eight grand.
&gt;&gt; Eight grand. So, that would be how many
per unit?
&gt;&gt; It's at six, but 50 bucks.
&gt;&gt; Oh, 57. Okay, that's right. That makes
sense. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Jeez.
&gt;&gt; Is that a good deal? I don't know. But
you you can find it out. all the
resources that we're just talking about
here. You can find this out. Reach out
to people that know the market. You
know, share the deal. Say, "Look, I want
to buy 140. Help me figure this out.
I'll we'll split it. I'll give you, you
know, I'll give you half or I'll give
you 40 units or whatever." So, I like
these deals. I think they're
fascinating.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Let's talk about Blackstones.
&gt;&gt; Oh, dude. I just bought a Blackstone. I

[51:01]
&gt;&gt; Oh, dude. I just bought a Blackstone. I
got it for Father's Day.
&gt;&gt; Awesome. That's great. You could have
bought three pallets here for $625.
Okay. Okay. Well, I got one for $450.
So,
&gt;&gt; that's a good deal. That's a good deal.
So, these are the big guys. The $1,000
36 in with the air fryer built in and a
hood and the whole nine yards.
&gt;&gt; Air fryer. Oh, wow. Okay.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. This Look at this. Three air
fries.
&gt;&gt; I'm very envious at this point.
&gt;&gt; See this air fryer one, air fryer 2, air
fryer 3. This is the big
&gt;&gt; I need to go have words with my wife cuz
mine doesn't have any of this.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. What kind of father?
&gt;&gt; I know.
&gt;&gt; And so, you look at these. These are the
actual pictures. They're on these
pallets. They're, you know, some of them
are boxes.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Some well packaged, but not Some
are in boxes, some are not. So, these
are store returns. Okay. Whole different
animal.
&gt;&gt; Here's one brand. You know, looks like
brand new in the box. Could be brand
new. Could not. You never know. Somebody
could have taken it apart, never used
it.
&gt;&gt; That's the risk. But they're ABR grade,
which means they look okay. But I have

[52:00]
which means they look okay. But I have
bought lots of Blackstone grles. Every
one of my buddies has one that has come
through me. Sometimes they show up and
they're beautiful and you just roll it
and you're like, "Oh, home run." Other
times they're covered in grease and oil
and you have to clean them. This is
Yeah, I don't know how to, you know,
this business you get your hands.
&gt;&gt; Your friend bought a bunch, didn't he?
Yeah. In the group. How has he done so
far? Do you know have any follow-up to
that?
&gt;&gt; I'm sure he's done really well. I don't
have the specifics in my brain, but
okay.
&gt;&gt; These things are like
&gt;&gt; Facebook Marketplace, the word
Blackstone, people go crazy. And you
know, you could have some video, you
could have yourself cooking something on
your Blackstone, that kind of stuff. So,
uh, now this is in Tumb Water,
Washington. So, you want to be as close
as possible because the shipping and the
freight, they can do three three
pallets. But
&gt;&gt; Blackston are gold, man. And I don't
know that you can make money buying
brand new units, but you can certainly
make money buying AB units. You just
explain it. You just tell it came from
Costco. And so, you just be real up
upfront with it. say, "Yeah, I buy
Costco excess stuff." And if you sell it
as as used, but you're going to get this

[53:01]
as as used, but you're going to get this
landed to your door less than a,000
bucks, you're you're going to sell it
for 4,000. You're going to make $3,000
in the weekend. No doubt about it.
&gt;&gt; Oh my gosh.
&gt;&gt; Right. I talked to a guy selling ice
makers the other day, buying Costco ice
makers, and he's like, you know, I I
usually get the pallet on pallet or two
on Thursday. I get them listed by
Friday, and by Sunday, I have my
investment back. And he made he in a
week he made $1,900 selling just to
selling these. And this guy, you know,
to selling them at night just people
come in after work and pick them up.
Rugs are amazing. Awesome market on
Facebook Marketplace. They sell for
nothing. Here's $3,800 worth of rugs
selling for $ 250. We'll give you a
quick rundown before
&gt;&gt; Have you sold rugs before? That would
intimidate me a bit just cuz who knows
what a good design is, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But they want people want to buy
inexpensive big rugs, 8 by10s. They
don't want to spend 330 bucks, but
they'll spend
&gt;&gt; floor covering.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, these are selling for $8 each.
&gt;&gt; Actually, $7.58. So, I'm not trying to

[54:01]
&gt;&gt; Actually, $7.58. So, I'm not trying to
tell you to spend 100 and sell it for 30
or 300.
&gt;&gt; I'm saying spend $8 and sell it for 100.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; 120 and all these big bigger the better.
Bigger the better. And if you get dirty
ones, take videos of them cleaning
because people love that stuff.
&gt;&gt; We could talk about pressure washers. a
whole another amazing we I I'll come
back and we'll talk about pressure
washers but
&gt;&gt; yes I want to talk about that I think
it's important to note that with the
quantity of items you buy your risk goes
down significantly yes it does like with
the blackstones there was nine of them
like
&gt;&gt; yes
&gt;&gt; you're going to be able to sell nine
blackstones these rugs there's what 103
you're going to be able to sell 10 rugs
okay 33 I guess you hadn't scrolled
&gt;&gt; these big ones there's at least you know
10 or so that are seven but here's a 10
by 10 Nautica rug, you know, brand
Ruggable. You know, Ruggables are the
ones you can throw in the washer. Those
are highly
&gt;&gt; in That's a good brand. Like the Yeti of
rugs.
&gt;&gt; That's right. The Yeti of rugs. I love
it. I love it.
&gt;&gt; With things like the auto parts, you you

[55:01]
&gt;&gt; With things like the auto parts, you you
can guarantee that they're going to end
up throwing away hundreds or thousands
of those things. They just will not
move, right?
&gt;&gt; Yes. You're going to wind up donating
them or taking them to the recycler or
something like that. The same with you.
In this business, you will always have
stuff you will donate. and you want to
be get, you know, find the pe the people
in your community that can use the stuff
and do it. So, yeah,
&gt;&gt; I could talk about this stuff all day.
There's a ton of stuff. There's this
32x12 building that sold last night for
$6,000 that I that you can buy.
&gt;&gt; I'm shopping for one of those right now,
&gt;&gt; dude. Right here in San Francisco. Dual
container modular office conference
room. $2,500. Two shipping containers.
Check this out.
&gt;&gt; I want those. I'll buy those.
&gt;&gt; You should go. You should Well, you got
to ship them. They're in San Francisco.
&gt;&gt; I don't care.
&gt;&gt; Look at this. Look inside. See, look at
this. This all comes inside this desk.
You
&gt;&gt; rent that out as a wee.
&gt;&gt; I know. Of course. And it's going to
close in 17 hours and it's at 2500
bucks. Right. This This stuff is every
single day. I'm telling you. Right.
&gt;&gt; Will you send me a link to that? I will.
I want to buy that.

[56:00]
I want to buy that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I just turned my buddy on who's a house
flipper up in Oh, this is that Where did
that go? Oh, yeah. Right here.
&gt;&gt; Dartmouth College in New Hampshire,
right? Yep. They just pulled out 2200
square feet of European oak veneer
flooring. It's gonna end in one day.
It's at 360 bucks. Um, phenomenal
condition. They have before and after.
They've removed it and stacked it for
you.
&gt;&gt; And I have a buddy that's flipping a,400
foot home that needs all new flooring. I
said, "You should go buy this. It's two
hours from him."
&gt;&gt; So, auctions are not just for flipping.
It's for upgrading your life. If you're
a remodeler, it's for saving money. If
you're a house flipper, it's for getting
deals so your investment's less. If
you're if you have a piece of property
and you want to put ADU on it or a 32 by
12, you know, incredible basically brand
new building.
&gt;&gt; I can't believe it sold for 6. It sells
for this every single day, Chris.
&gt;&gt; What are we talking about day? Why are
we talking and I'm not buying all these?

[57:00]
we talking and I'm not buying all these?
You could rent that out for a,000 bucks
a month.
&gt;&gt; Easy.
&gt;&gt; It's six grand.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. You got to get it near you. This
one's in Lincoln, Nebraska. University
of Nebraska.
&gt;&gt; I don't give a crap. I'll drive to
Nebraska. That's a 5h hour drive.
&gt;&gt; You got it. You got it. So, here, this
one's really interesting. It's a little
bit more of a chunk of cash, but it's
Check these out. So, this is a site. I
love Gov deals. You may have talked
about it before. I didn't even know that
Google Glass was still a a viable thing
to use. Okay. So, I did I did a little
research. These typically sell
&gt;&gt; between 150 and $300. if you sell on
eBay and they sell every day. There's
some decent velocity. Now, this is a
thousand pairs of brand new Google Glass
XC Explorer Edition. I have no idea what
you could do with them. Some of my
followers came back with some different
ideas. I guess they still work, but
Google doesn't update the software
anymore. That kind of thing. These are
brand new in the box. These came from a
city in the Bay Area. I don't know what
they were doing with them, but right now

[58:01]
they were doing with them, but right now
they're selling at $45 each.
&gt;&gt; Brand new. You have to buy a thousand.
&gt;&gt; You have to buy a thousand. There there
are a couple of lots up here that have
less quantity, but I think there's a box
of them and they're selling for maybe 75
bucks, 85 bucks. This is how you make
$100,000, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; No doubt about it. This is And you
wouldn't need to sell very many to get
your investment back. They're brand new
in the box. They have this stuff. They
show the boxes. They show this. They
show everything. Here's all the
containers. And this stuff is every
single day. The deals are not hard to
find. You just have to Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You know, I always tell people, don't
don't watch Netflix, you know, watch
auctions because it's more interesting.
So, yeah, I love this deal. It's
fascinating.
&gt;&gt; All right. Well, I couldn't help. I had
to open up eBay. I clicked sold items. I
clicked new Google Glass XE-C Explorer
Edition.
&gt;&gt; 155 255
&gt;&gt; 255 155.
&gt;&gt; I think I think there's a 351 in there.

[59:02]
&gt;&gt; I think I think there's a 351 in there.
And I'm sure there's some nuance and
this is not the deal you start with if
you're getting involved in reselling. I
want to make that clear. But it's a deal
that as a reseller if you had I always
ask people what's your unfair advantage.
And some people their unfair advantage
is well I have access to capital.
&gt;&gt; I have money. You know what do I do? I
how do I how do I deploy it? It's like
well
&gt;&gt; that could be a disadvantage if you make
stupid decisions.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. That's it. So, you know, if
you studied this, and I don't
necessarily recommend buying consumer
electronics because I think the margins
are no good anymore, right? We we both
know. Yes. You know, we squeeze those
margins down to to nothing. It's a
fascinating product and and it's
something that it's interesting to look
at. I love it.
&gt;&gt; Okay. This is awesome. You know what I
could see someone doing with those
Google glasses is selling 90 95% of them
and storing the rest because those will
for sure be collector's items.
&gt;&gt; I agree. Yeah. I have this cashback
mentality where I just I'm always like,

[1:00:00]
mentality where I just I'm always like,
"Okay, how do you sell enough quickly to
get your money back?" So I I wouldn't
even try to sell them for the first
batch at 150 bucks. I would just be
like, "How many do I have to sell to get
my $45,000 back?"
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Right. Can I sell
&gt;&gt; Yep. you know, 500 of them. Okay, if
that's the case, I'd sell them. I'd move
them all out, wholesale, get my cash
back, and then I'd have 500 and I'd say,
"Well, I'm going to put them up at 199
and just sit on them, you know, or
whatever and do that." So, I like to get
my investment back.
&gt;&gt; So, that one has 17 watchers. Does it
have any bids yet?
&gt;&gt; This one is It's kind of interesting.
Sometimes they'll tell you some of them
show bids and some of them don't. I
don't think have any bids, and I will
tell you why. because it was at 50,000 a
few days ago when they lowered the first
bid to 45,000.
&gt;&gt; I don't think it has any bids.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Well, tell me what happens with if
nobody bids on it. Nobody wants it at
that price. Will they try again at a
lower?
&gt;&gt; They'll try. Typically, they're going to
try again a lower PL. They may break
these up, right? Because it's a pretty
ballsy move to throw a thousand units up

[1:01:00]
ballsy move to throw a thousand units up
there. If I was advising this, it's a
municipality, right? That nobody cares.
It's not their money. But if it was a
private business, the first thing I
would tell them is, oh, let's sell them
in lots of a hundred, you know, let's
there's no because at a hundred, you
probably get a $100, right? And maybe
you sell, you know, 10,000 at a time.
That's 10 grand is easier for people to
come up with. I'll wrap it up. Come
visit the our reseller mastermind. It's
shannon.commastermind.
A bunch of Chris's guys are in there. We
talk about these deals every day. It's
totally fun. There's all kinds of stuff
going on. And I'll come back because I
have a lot of other stuff that we can
talk about. I mean, it's crazy.
&gt;&gt; If you're watching or listening, please
comment on Spotify, on YouTube. Should
we do this segment again? Shannon's for
sure coming back. Should we do this type
of show again? I I really want to know
cuz I would love it.
&gt;&gt; If you like us to go through these
auctions, I can show you. And
&gt;&gt; you know, some of them are closed, but
most of them are all open. You know,
some of them closed last night, but most
