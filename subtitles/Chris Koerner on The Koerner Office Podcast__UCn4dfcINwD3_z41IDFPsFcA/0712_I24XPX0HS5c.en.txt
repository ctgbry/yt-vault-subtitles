[00:00]
This is absolutely incredible. 20 bucks
a month and you can have a team of PhD
employees at your fingertips. Keep in
mind I have six agents running at the
same time right now. Each agent is
taking the place of multiple employees.
I'm going to start so many businesses.
Not only is it making this pitch deck,
it's also incorporating things that it
knows about me personally because it
remembers everything you ask it across
chats. Now, YouTube, 22-year-old, 50K a
month business. Holy crap, there's a ton
of Chrome extensions, apps that are all
built on top of andor with OpenAI that
are about to be made irrelevant. OpenAI
is slowly eating the internet.
Well, Chat GPT just broke the internet
again. And not just with another
chatbot. They literally just gave it the
ability to take control of your browser
and perform tasks for you. And what I'm
about to show you is so insane. It's way
too early to be making a video. I was
literally lying in bed a few minutes

[01:01]
literally lying in bed a few minutes
ago. It's 4:48 in the morning. I
couldn't sleep. You can see my bed head.
And why should I sleep? Because chat GPT
agent now exists. Which means, yes, now
ChatGpt can take over your browser for
you and perform tasks on your behalf.
tasks such as finding every plumber in
Nashville without a website, grabbing
their contact info and writing
personalized emails to sell them
websites, or scraping your competitor's
pricing pages, and building a complete
pitch deck on how to beat them. or my
personal favorite, telling it to find 20
dentists in Austin, research their
services, write custom cold emails for
each one, and export everything to a CSV
with follow-up templates, all while you
sleep in like I didn't. And here's the
thing, and this is why I'm making this
video at 5:00 a.m. We're looking at the
biggest shift in how business gets done
since the internet. Literally, I've been
doing this stuff for 18, 20 years, and
I've never seen a tool move this fast.
Yesterday, you needed a virtual

[02:01]
Yesterday, you needed a virtual
assistant, a data scraper, a copywriter,
an intern, and maybe a research
assistant to do everything I'm about to
show you today. And today, you just tell
this thing what you want it to do and
watch it work. But here's what's kind of
the depressing thing. Most people are
just going to treat this like a fancy
Google search engine. They're going to
ask it to help them brainstorm, while
other people are using it to automate
entire revenue streams. And the gap
between the people who just get this and
the people who don't is about to become
as big as the Grand Canyon. And if
you're not moving on this stuff right
now, like literally this week, you're
going to be competing against people who
have AI doing the work of entire teams.
So over the next 30 or so minutes, I'm
going to show you exactly how I use this
thing to automate what would normally
take me 8 plus hours of manual work.
We're talking real business tasks,
revenue generating stuff, the kind of
work that either costs you thousands to
outsource or keeps you grinding until 2

[03:00]
outsource or keeps you grinding until 2
a.m. And if you stick around, I'm going
to show you the one automation I built
that literally made my jaw drop. It's
just so good. And I'm honestly a little
scared about what this means for
business owners. So, grab some DPZ with
me because after this video, you're
never going to look at getting work done
the same way again. Let's get to it. All
right. I think one business idea that
exists today, existed 10 years ago, and
will exist in another 10 years is simply
making websites for other people. AI is
not going to make that go away. It's
just going to make it a more profitable
endeavor for people like you and I. So,
here's a misconception that some people
have about building websites for people.
They want to go find business owners
that don't already have a website. But
that's a misconception. My friend owns a
pressure washing business. And you know
how he finds most of his customers? He
takes little bags. He puts rocks in them
with flyers. And he drives to nice
neighborhoods. And he finds the homes
that have the cleanest driveways. And he
throws the rocks in the bags onto the
cleanest driveways because those people

[04:00]
cleanest driveways because those people
value keeping their driveway clean. He
used to throw them on the dirty
driveways cuz those people need pressure
washing. But those people have no
interest in pressure washing clearly.
And so the same principle exists with
building websites for business owners.
We want to find business owners that
already have websites. We don't need to
assume or guess that it's an ugly
website because statistically speaking,
it probably is. And we want to do this
at scale. So, we're not even going to
look at the website. We just want to
make sure that they already have one.
Cuz if you go give this same offer to
business owners that don't have a
website, they could have one by now.
They're getting pitched websites all day
every day, but they don't value a
website. So, they're not our customer.
So, the first task I'm going to do with
Chad GBT agent is ask it to go find 20
plumbers in Nashville that have websites
and put as much of their contact
information into a Google sheet for me.
Okay. So, we're going to click this
tools button. We're going to click agent
mode and I'm going to say, find me a
list of 20 plumbers in Nashville

[05:03]
list of 20 plumbers in Nashville
that have a website. Then find as much
contact info of the owners as possible.
Email for sure.
Cell phone number would be nice. Put all
of this data into a Google sheet. Move
fast. That's one thing that I've learned
with operator or with chat GPT. Even if
you're on the voice mode or whatever,
tell it to move fast and it will. It'll
move faster. I'll move fast. Okay, it is
moving fast. Oh man, this is so good.
So, OpenAI has basically said that chat
GPT agent combines all of the agentic
features of operator with all of the
deep research features of deep research
and put them together which is really a
powerful thing. I'm going to say cross
reference with Manta or other publicly

[06:04]
reference with Manta or other publicly
available
directories
to get the info that's harder to find.
So
one common mistake that people make is
just assuming that Chad GPT knows what
they know or assuming that Chad GPT
knows what they want it to do. For
instance, Manta has tens of millions of
business listings. Chad GPT has surely
scraped Manta, but it doesn't mean that
it's going to think to do that in this
moment. So me asking it to do things
more specifically is another way of
uploading reference data to JAGBT, which
I always recommend doing. Anytime you
ask it to do a task or to return
something interesting for you, give it
reference data. For instance, don't ask
it, I want you to give me 10 business
ideas that are approachable and
affordable to start. No. Say, give me 10

[07:00]
affordable to start. No. Say, give me 10
business ideas that are affordable and
approachable to start. Here are four
examples. Dog walking, car detailing,
landscaping, having a stand at a farmers
market. If you already like those ideas,
then it will return 10 more that are
more along those lines of those ideas.
It's reference data. It says, I'll open
the first search result to further
investigate its contents. It's going to
be interesting to see how long this
takes. And if you remember my video
about Chad GBT operator, it was much
much slower than this. It's amazing to
see how far they've come in just a few
months. So, here's how this works. I
make you free videos. I actually know
what I'm talking about. And if you
implement what I talk about, you'll make
a lot more money and have a better life.
And all I ask for in return is that you
hit the subscribe button and maybe even
the notification bell just like that.
Thank you. All right. While it's doing
this Nashville plumber task, I'm going
to open a new tab and have it do
something else at the same time. So, I
own an e-commerce business called Texas
Snacks, and we sell Texas Snacks.
Specifically, we resell things that we

[08:01]
Specifically, we resell things that we
buy from a big gas station chain called
Bies. A lot of clones, a lot of
competitors have popped up, and I want
to know what are they selling well, what
are they doing differently from us. I
want to do a competitive research
without having to do it myself. All
right, I own texasnacks.com. We have a
handful of competitors, find our five
biggest competitors based on publicly
available traffic data, and write a
report on what they do very well, what
products seem to sell well, how is their
SEO, etc., what can I learn from them?
So, even if you don't already own a
business, you can use a prompt like this
to do competitive research on other
companies and then you can sell them
that research or you can help them
implement the results of that research
as an expert, as a consultant, as an
agency owner. Let's see what this comes
up with. All right, we're going to have
three agents running at once. I'm going
to ask it to do this. Make a list of
five dentists in Austin, owners only.
Write five cold emails that are
hyperpersonalized to each of them. Also

[09:01]
hyperpersonalized to each of them. Also
almost creepily stalkerish personalized.
Tell them I offer SEO services only for
dentists in Austin and would love to hop
on a call with them.
All right, it's going. All right, let's
see if we can have four running at the
same time. So, I'm going to ask it to
analyze Google Trends for five business
ideas, check competition levels,
estimate market size, and rank by
opportunity score. These must be ideas
that are affordable to start. Okay, I
have four agents running at the same
time. Right now, let's ask it to do
something more personalized where it's
going to have to log into some of my
accounts. Check calendar for next week's
meetings. Research each client's recent
news or updates. Create briefing docs
with talking points.
Five agents running concurrently. Okay.
Please take over to login with your
Google account credentials. You're about
to control Chad GPT's browser. Won't
take screenshots. Your browser session
will be saved. This may put your data at

[10:01]
will be saved. This may put your data at
risk. I'm a risky guy. Let's do it.
Okay. It's in my calendar. All right.
Let's see what it's done with the
dentist so far. Outside of the office,
he enjoys running, lifting weights,
paddle boarding, and Spartan races. Dr.
Pevner hangs out with his boxer dog,
Yuri, paddle boards on Lake Austin,
practices condundalini yoga, plays
pickle ball. Oh man, this is so good.
All right, here's one of the emails it
wrote. Hi, Dr. Matthews. Chris here from
Austin. I read that fewer than 6% of
dentists hold F A G and you earned yours
after 500 plus hours of study. That's
serious hustle. You went from Penn State
business grad to NYU dental school, a
Monte Fiori residency, and an implant
fellowship, then uprooted Austin in
2020. I also saw you a runner and
Spartan race competitor who likes paddle
boarding lifting. As a fellow
overachiever, I think your online
presence should reflect all that grit.
Right now, your site barely shows up on
page one when I search South Austin
implants. I host a business podcast and

[11:02]
implants. I host a business podcast and
run an SEO firm exclusively for Austin
dentists. We help practices like yours
dominate local search. I'd love to chat
and even feature your story. Shoot me a
time and I'll bring the coffee. I don't
drink coffee. Wait until you hear how
many new patients we can drive your way.
Wow. This entire task, doing all this
research and writing five
hyperpersonalized cold emails took 3
minutes. And all I did was prompt it
once. No follow-ups, nothing. All right.
One day I want to sell this powdered
drink concoction that I invented for my
own needs. That day isn't anytime soon,
but I want to see what other drink
concoctions are selling on Amazon and
what complaints people have about them.
So, let's do that research. I want to
sell a healthy powdered energy drink on
Amazon. Research Amazon reviews for
similar products. Extract common
complaints. Create a feature list
addressing each pain point.
All right. on the cold emails to dentist
one. Let's see if it can go a step

[12:00]
one. Let's see if it can go a step
further and actually send those emails
for me. Now, keep in mind, I don't sell
SEO services. This is just an example,
but yes, I am still going to send these
emails cuz I want to see if it'll work.
What's the worst that could happen? Some
dentist wakes up on a Saturday morning
confused about my email. Who cares? Go a
step further and send these emails for
me. Gmail,
use the email addresses you found. All
right, keep in mind I have six agents
running at the same time right now. Each
agent is taking the place of multiple
employees. So for almost no money, I'm
essentially paying 15 to 20 people to
work for me at 5 a.m. on a Saturday
morning. All right, let's check in on
the powdered energy drink competitive
analysis. It's gathering negative
reviews, capturing flavor and taste
issues, citing negative points for
review, scrolling their websites,
looking at reviews. Too sweet. Way, way,
way too sweet. This is so incredible.
Does not mix well. Oh my gosh,

[13:02]
Does not mix well. Oh my gosh,
I'm going to start so many businesses.
And if I check on the agent that is
researching all of my meetings for next
week, it is going hyper in-depth. A lot
of these meetings are just with my
business partners and friends. And so
it's very interesting that I can cross
reference what it's finding versus what
I actually know about them already.
Okay. And it's done. Worked for 9
minutes. Here's your client meeting
briefing for next week. Sorted by
meeting with latest news and talking
points to keep you in the know. Hope it
makes the convos flow smoothly. Chris
week of July 20th to 26, 2025. Okay,
it's just listing them all out right
here. Interview for the real estate
investing podcast. Okay, here's a brief
for each client. Brandon is my friend
and business partner. In a modern retail
interview, he said Walaroo, his agency,
works with 135 e-commerce brand and is
shifting budgets to Pinterest ads. Okay.

[14:00]
shifting budgets to Pinterest ads. Okay.
A PR news article describes Walaroo as a
premier social media advertising agency.
The merger with Arvo and their focus on
Pinterest signals that Brandon is
betting on underpriced attention.
Talking points. Ask how the merger has
changed day-to-day operations and what
new capabilities clients are seeing.
This is incredible. Not only did it do
research for me, but it formed its own
opinions based on that research found.
It's not even asking or expecting me to
form my own opinions on that research,
which could be concerning if you look at
it that way. But it's also awesome
because I don't have to use those
opinions. I can use those opinions to
form my own opinions, but at least it
gets me along the lines of forming
opinions about this research. It removes
the friction. All right, Nick Hilleski,
that's my best friend and business
partner. It does a fact check. Ask him
about lessons from buying and exiting
his first company. This is actually
really helpful because this guy Kevin, I
don't know. I'm going to be on his
podcast. I've never talked to him
before. His assistant even set up this

[15:01]
before. His assistant even set up this
meeting with us. So, this is actually
super helpful that I'm learning about
what he does before I go on his podcast.
Their featured asset is American
Presidential Estates, a 503 lot
institutional grade mobile home park
near Ann Arbor, Michigan. Talking
points. What attracted him to this 503
lot park? This is so good. says, "Lead
each conversation with hard numbers."
Keep in mind, I logged into my calendar
once, and I won't need to do that again.
And it did all this research for me in 9
minutes as I did other things on the
computer. This is something that my
assistant would do. Hey, Megan, I hope
you're not watching this.
All right, on the dentist one, it's now
asking me to log into my Gmail. All
right, let's see what it does now that
it's in my email. It's interesting. It
says, "Watch while ChatGpt works with
sensitive data. ChatGPT is working with
mail.google.com, which contains
sensitive data. If you notice anything
bad happening, you can stop the task."
That's them trying to cover their butt.
They don't want to be liable for

[16:00]
They don't want to be liable for
anything that happens. All right, let's
check out my energy drink competitor
research here. All right. Common
complaints from Amazon reviews and
expert articles. Packaging is difficult
to open and poorly designed. Powder
clumps or doesn't dissolve. Poor taste.
Overly sweet or sickly flavor. Limited
flavor variety. Product is expensive.
Acquired taste. Suggested features to
address each pain point. Easy open.
Tamper evident. P packaging.
Anti-clumping. Yada yada yada. Here's
what people hate about powdered energy
drinks. How you can fix it. Easy open
packaging. No more clumps. Clean taste.
Balanced sweetness. Flavor variety.
Affordable value. No acquired taste.
Caffeine options. Some people don't want
caffeine. So, it would be a mistake if I
just left this as is. Now I have all
this data. Now I want to use the rest of
Chad GPT, its whole corpus of knowledge,
the LLM, this large language model.
These are the things that companies are
spending billions of dollars to build. I
don't want to waste it. So what it just
acquired for me is now proprietary. This

[17:02]
acquired for me is now proprietary. This
is info that I have that no one else
has, but I want to ask a question. So
I'm going to say, which complaints
appeared the most often? I don't want to
fix problems that are anecdotal and
don't affect a large percentage of
people. So, the one where I asked it to
analyze Google Trends for five business
ideas is kind of taking a while. So, I
just said, "How's it going? Moving
along?" And it said, "Hey, Chris." Yep.
Moving along nicely. Gathering data and
citations. Almost done pulling the info
together. We'll have that ranking and
summary ready for you soon. Now, on the
agent where I asked it to actually email
these dentists from my email, it's not
letting me navigate away from the tab.
It wants to make sure that I'm watching
everything it's doing inside my email,
which is a little annoying, but I can
see why they want this. It is a
liability. It's the same principle as
Tesla not letting me look at my phone
while my car is driving itself. It
doesn't want to get sued if I run into
something and full self-driving doesn't
work. But that's going away. The Tesla

[18:00]
work. But that's going away. The Tesla
network just launched in Austin and cars
are driving without people in the
driver's seat. So eventually this will
go away, too. All right, I'm watching it
work inside my inbox. It's a little
freaky. It put the entire email in the
subject line. The current draft to Dr.
Gordon is problematic. So, I'll close
the window and start fresh. It's fixing
itself at least, but it still has the
whole text of the email as the subject
line. I'm going to tell it, be sure to
use an optimized subject line. Don't put
the body of the email in the subject
line
as you're doing now. All right. If we go
check on the plumber one, it's saying
that the research is ready, but it needs
to log into Google Sheets so it can
enter it for me. All right, I just
logged in to my Google Drive. Let's see
what it does. That is the annoying part

[19:00]
what it does. That is the annoying part
is having to log into all these
services. The more you need it to do,
the more you want it to do personalized
things in your accounts on your behalf,
the more you have to log in. And like
this full self-driving analogy, this
will be fixed in time. But for now, it's
just a little obnoxious. All right. If
we look at the energy drink one worked
for 49 seconds and said, "The biggest
complaints I kept seeing across Amazon
reviews and expert writeups were mixing
and clumps, taste, sweetness level,
packaging." I'm going to go a step
further and say, "Show me a pie chart
that represents how many complaints each
of these got proportionally."
All right, it's making a pie chart. Oh,
man. This is insane. I got to zoom in on
this. Proportion of common complaints in
Amazon energy drink reviews. Mixability
31%, taste issues 25%, packaging 12%.
Price/expensive
12%, limited flavor 6%, counterfeit 6%.

[20:00]
12%, limited flavor 6%, counterfeit 6%.
Holy cow, this is incredible. Imagine if
I were making a pitch deck. Boom. Put it
in the pitch deck. In fact, I think I
will. I think I will do that. I'll ask
him to make pitch deck for me. Let's say
I was actually making this energy drink
and I want to raise money for it and I
want to show potential investors the
promise of this potential business. So,
I wanted to take all this research and
say, I am fixing all the problems in the
energy drink market. Here's what they
are. Here's what they are
proportionally. And here's how I plan to
fix it. This is absolutely incredible.
Quick question. What if there were a
private community out there of people
that were building businesses based on
this podcast? Well, I just made it and
it's only for business starters and
business builders. It's called TK owners
and it's basically like having me and a
hundred other business geniuses as your
business partner, but you give them 0%
equity. Also, there's going to be
exclusive new trends, growth hacks,
business ideas, and a database of
everything I've ever talked about.
You'll find thousands of startup case
studies. You'll have weekly ask me

[21:01]
studies. You'll have weekly ask me
anything with me while I'll answer your
questions directly. You'll be in my
Slack channel where I'm hanging out
every week and helping members
one-on-one. We've got exclusive guest
speakers including some names that
you'll recognize. And if you're building
something cool, I'll introduce you to
anyone you need. TK Owners is the
fastest way to plug into a smart,
ambitious group of builders and
accountability partners that are sharing
wins without the fluff. And it's 99
bucks a month, about the cost of an
energy drink per day. You can join now
at tkowners.com. Link in the show notes.
How many people in the world know that
of all the complaints about energy drink
powders, mixability/clumps
is 31% of them? See, that's the magic of
AI. AI is not magical by itself. AI is
magical based on what we prompt it to
do. And now, today, as of today, AI is
magical based on what we ask it to do
for us. This has never been possible in
the history of the world. I don't even
know if it can do this. I know that like

[22:00]
know if it can do this. I know that like
Manis can do this. There's a couple
other AI tools that make pitch decks,
but we're going to see. Make a pitch
deck showing all of your findings as if
I were raising investor capital for this
energy drink business. All right. Do you
remember this prompt? Analyze Google
Trends for five business ideas. Check
competition levels. Estimate market
size. yada yada. This one took a while.
It says 2 minutes here, but that is not
accurate. It took like 15 or 20 minutes.
Here we go. Business ideas chosen. Pet
sitting, dog walking, home office
cleaning services, online tutoring,
social media marketing services for
local businesses, and mobile car wash
services. They require relatively low
startup cost because equipment can be
purchased gradually and they can operate
from a home base. All right, this is
good. This is pretty good. Strong
seasonality.
Okay, it shows the market size, the
competition level. It ranks them by
opportunity scores. It ranked
petsitting/dogwalking as number one.
Seasonal peaks and strong rebound.
It's very fragmented. 99% independent,

[23:00]
It's very fragmented. 99% independent,
moderate competition. Mobile car wash is
number two. cleaning services, number
three, online tutoring, four, social
media marketing, number five, and it
ranked them out of 10. Now, I'm going to
ask it to do this. I'm going all in.
All right. I'm going all in on the
mobile car wash business. Find four
specific and tactical case studies about
other real entrepreneurs that did the
same and how they found success. What
were their startup costs and marketing
methods? What were their sales in the
beginning? Scrape Reddit, Facebook X,
and other niche blogs and YouTube videos
for stories. The more niche and specific
the better. If you don't ask it that,
it's going to give you some generic
stuff like a CNBC article that has no
tactics or anything in it. If you don't
tell it where to go scrape, then it
might not scrape where you want it to
scrape. So, let's see what it does. I'm
loving the power of having the agent go
out and do research for you, compile all
this data, and then you just start
asking it questions. Okay, so it came
back with something very, very fast.

[24:01]
back with something very, very fast.
Reddit, I spent 5 hours, made my money
back, and it has links to everything.
Holy crap. Reddit, solo detailing, first
month, spent $811, made $920 from five
customers in month one. Tactics,
takeaway, YouTube, 22-year-old, 50k a
month business. Holy crap. Summary
table. Startup cost 400,400.
Like, it's putting it all together for
me. So now if I wanted to take this a
step further, I could say, "Come up with
a dayby-day launch plan over the next 30
days. I want to do this business. I want
to launch this business. I want you to
use data points from all of these
stories. I asked you for four. Now I
want 40. I want 40 stories. Take the
best from all of them and make me a
30-day launch plan of how I can launch
this business." So like a lot of this
was already available before Chad GBT
Agent, right? Some of this isn't
surprising. We could have asked it to do
that, but the power here is having it go
out and do that extra step. Open up 15

[25:01]
out and do that extra step. Open up 15
tabs at the same time and start doing
all this research, start compiling it.
We could have it put it into a pitch
deck for us, into a Google sheet for us,
into a PDF for us, into cold emails to
raise money from investors for us. None
of that was available. So, the powerful
part is doing all this research and leg
work and all of this and then asking it
questions and then using it as your own
personal mini chat GPT for all that leg
work that it's already done. That's
what's blowing my mind about all this.
And if we go back to the energy drink
tab, it's still making a pitch deck from
scratch with code. All right, if we
check on the emails to dentist, I said,
"How's it going?" Almost done, Chris.
Emails drafted and prepped for Dr. Dr.
Mata, Dr. Gawkale, Dr. Gordon. Subject
lines were too long. I'm fixing those
up. Drafts were clean, but one had a
formatting glitch. Quick review of all
five. Want a quick preview of one fixed
subject email? No. Just send them all

[26:01]
subject email? No. Just send them all
ASAP.
I just love that it fixes itself.
I just picture like a robot in my house
5 10 years from now doing laundry,
cooking for me. Something breaks,
something falls off the robot. The robot
kneels down, picks it up, puts it back
on, runs a software update from the
internet, goes to Amazon, orders a new
part. It arrives the next day. It
unboxes it. It puts it back in its
armpit or whatever. That's how robots
are going to behave. You can be scared
by it. They're going to be adapted to
AI. Doesn't matter. It's going to happen
whether we like it or not. That's what
Chad GBT is doing right now. It's
breaking and then it's fixing itself.
All right. This is absolutely
incredible. It's been working on this
energy drink pitch deck for 12 minutes
and it's done.
It's done.
I just had to create this pitch deck
with a prompt. I know. I know. Man, if
there's other tools out there that could
make kind of ugly pitch decks, but not

[27:00]
make kind of ugly pitch decks, but not
combined with agentic features or with
the power of chat GPT, the fastest
growing company in the history of the
world. The slides start with strong
numbers. So, it's making the pitch deck
in an optimized way, in a way that I
don't even know how to make pitch decks.
We call out the top pain points, show a
pie chart, lay out the solutions. The
slide covers direct to consumer via
Amazon subscriptions, leveraging your
social media footprint. And here's the
thing about Chat GPT. Here's why OpenAI
might just become the most valuable
company in the world. First of all,
they're the quickest company to reach a
$500 billion valuation. Remember 101 15
years ago there were zero$500 billion
companies ever in the history of the
world. Today there's a handful of 1 2 3
4 5 trillion dollar companies like you
could count them on one or two hands.
Open AAI became a half a trillion dollar
company in the matter of 5 years. It
took Google 20 years to do that. And
here's why. Because it knows everything

[28:01]
here's why. Because it knows everything
about us. If you freak out about this,
then delete your account. That's fine,
but that's not why you're watching this.
I want chat GPT to know everything about
me. That's why they have such low churn.
People don't leave because it remembers
everything you ask it across chats now.
That wasn't possible a few months ago.
So, not only is it making this pitch
deck in an optimized way, as good pitch
decks should be, but it's also
incorporating things that it knows about
me personally, which is mind-blowing. my
social media footprint, everything. And
I didn't even ask it to. If I would have
asked it to do that, it probably would
have put in a lot more personalized
things. So, let's look at the pitch
deck. Okay. Market opportunity and pain
points, consumer complaint analysis, our
solution, instant dissolve, no clumps,
balance, taste. Now, it is pretty ugly
if you're watching this. Competitive
advantage investment opportunity. Join
us. Still, it made a pitch deck from

[29:02]
us. Still, it made a pitch deck from
scratch. And I could say, "Here's what I
could do." One of the most legendary
pitch decks of all time was Airbnb's
pitch deck. Here it is. So, I'm going to
download it and I'm going to go back to
this chat window and I'm going to upload
it. So, I said, "Make the design more
similar to the design of the attached
pitch deck. Incorporate more personal
stories and anecdotes about me
personally that you either know from
searching about me online or from our
private chats wherever relevant." All
right. Now, if we look at the
competitive landscape for
Texasnacks.com, let's see what it says.
Amazon.com. It's right. It was kind of a
trick question because Amazon is my
biggest competitor, or at least third
party resellers on Amazon are my biggest
competitors. I didn't lead it that way.
I thought it was just going to find
random Shopify stores that also compete
against me, but it listed Amazon as
number one. Okay. Walmart. Yep. Texas
Bite Box. I'd never even heard of them.
They claims to have shipped 16,000
products, serve 13,000 customers. Okay,

[30:00]
products, serve 13,000 customers. Okay,
that's a lot. What they do well, clear
merchandising and bundling, social
proof, cross-platform promotion, lessons
for Texas Snacks, emphasize social proof
on your site, use Tik Tok and Instagram
more aggressively. That's true. We need
to do that. Johnny's Goods, I know about
them. Brad Catalog, lessons for Texas
Snacks, expand content marketing. And
then Texas Nuggets, niche store with
simple UX. It even like judged the clean
layout of their site. Additional
competitors, small but noteworthy snacks
for me. Wow, that is really really good.
Okay, so if I look at the dentist in
Austin, it was not a complete bust. It
did lose control of the browser, which
was my fault because I was switching
tabs and it wanted me to stay in the tab
because it was in my Gmail. But if I go
into my Gmail in a different tab and I
look at my drafts as I'm doing right
here, look at this draft. Your pain-free
dentistry deserves page one ranking.
Now, I'm not a fan of that subject line.
It's not one that I would write. It
looks a little spammy. I doubt it gets

[31:00]
looks a little spammy. I doubt it gets
opened by most people, but I do find it
interesting that it wrote emails in the
style that I've told Chat GBT to respond
to me in, which is in quick bullet
points. Hi, Dr. Gordon. I'm Chris, a
business podcast host. You own Austin
Links Dentistry. You graduated the top
of your class, yada yada yada. It's just
like, I'm stalking you. I'm stalking
you. I'm stalking you. will you buy from
me? But I could just click send. There
was a little trial and error here. This
one has the email keep dentistry weird
and rank West Creek Dental number one. I
mean, should I just click send? I kind
of want to click send. And it did the
same thing here. It has the email. It
has the subject line. It has the full
body. Just incredible. Just incredible.
I don't have to hire anyone to do my
cold emails anymore. I just need to
prompt it and then log in. I wonder how
many emails it could send like this. And
the magic is not in cold emailing. It's
in all the research it's doing
beforehand. There are tools like Apollo
that do some of this, but it doesn't do

[32:00]
that do some of this, but it doesn't do
it all in one place. Most importantly,
once again, it doesn't know everything
about me. It doesn't know how I write.
It doesn't know how I usually like to
pitch people. It doesn't know my
approach. It's not built on a corpus of
data over the last 2 years of using Chad
GBT. Chad GBT is doing what Costco has
done with Kirkland. They find
best-selling products in their stores
and then they turn it into a Kirkland
product and push them out. They
vertically integrate. Amazon does the
same thing with Amazon Basics. Wow,
these batteries are crushing. Let's make
Amazon batteries and sell them for 30%
cheaper. That's what OpenAI is doing
with all these features. So, there's a
ton of Chrome extensions, add-ons,
plugins, apps that are all built on top
of and or with andor integrated with
OpenAI that are about to be made
irrelevant one by one by one because
OpenAI is slowly eating the internet.

If we check in on this uh powdered
energy drink pitch deck, it's turning
the famous welloptimized well-designed
Airbnb pitch deck into my pitch deck so
I can keep those design elements but use
it for what I'm trying to do. If we
check in on the Nashville plumbers, it
kept glitching out on the Google sheet
because I kept navigating away from it.
Once again, once you log into something,
it wants you to stay on that screen.
Now, I could have pulled the tab out and
made it its own tab so it appears open
on my MacBook, but I didn't want to mess
with that. So, I said instead, just turn
it into a downloadable CSV of Nashville
Plumbers. Boom. And when I do that, I
know you can't see it, so I'm going to
paste it into a Google sheet so I can
share my tab and do that. All right, got
this is pasted over from the CSV. Boom.
Look at that. exactly 20 Nashville
plumbers with their websites, their

[34:01]
plumbers with their websites, their
names, their phone numbers, and their
emails. Holy crap. Now, that one took a
while. It took like a half hour and it
glitched out a couple times, but it only
glitched out because I needed it to log
in. So, there's a learning for you. The
less you ask it to log in for now, the
better. The more seamless and
frictionless it will be for you. So, to
speed things up, I said I only need the
new redesigned deck to have five
beautiful slides patterned after the
Airbnb one. All right, before we wrap
this up by seeing the last pitch deck
that it spits out based on Airbnbs,
let's recap the six things that I've had
this agent do at the same time. Number
one, look at my upcoming calendar
appointments, do research on the people
I'm meeting with, and prep me for the
calls. It did that masterfully. I had to
log in. I didn't need to babysit the
browser as I did in Gmail and Google
Sheets, and it worked perfectly, and it
worked fast. I'd give that a 9 out of
10. I also had it find 20 plumbers in
Nashville. Find their cell phone
numbers, their emails, their websites,
and their business names. Put it in a

[35:00]
and their business names. Put it in a
Google sheet. It took a very long time
for only 20 plumbers, which I wasn't
pleased with. It glitched out in Google
Sheets, which I wasn't pleased with, but
it did get me the data in a CSV form.
I'd give that a 6.5 out of 10. The next
thing I asked it to do was find five
dentists in Austin, look up a crazy
amount of info about them. I don't know
how it found all this stuff and write
five personalized cold emails. It did
this pretty well. It did glitch out in
my Gmail, which of course it's going to
do that if it's inside my Gmail and I
need to log in with two factor and all
that, but it wrote the email and it
would have sent them if it didn't
glitched out. If I wouldn't have
navigated away from the tab doing a
thousand things at once, it would have
actually sent the emails. But I did
write them. They were in my drafts.
Almost all of them were ready to go. I'd
give that one a 7.5 out of 10 because
the difficulty level was quite a bit
higher on that one. Now, I asked it to
do a competitive analysis for
Texasnacks.com. It did this masterfully.
Deep Research could have done something

[36:00]
Deep Research could have done something
very similar. So, this wasn't a big
stretch for the Agentic capabilities
that just came out, but I was very
impressed that it put Amazon and Walmart
first because it was kind of a trick
question that it passed with flying
colors. And then it listed out one
competitor that I'd never heard of that
seems to be doing a pretty good job and
then a few competitors that I have heard
of. So I was able to cross reference all
that. I'd give that one an 8.5 out of
10. And then I asked it to find five
business ideas that were trending based
on Google Trends data. So it did cross
reference that and it worked quite a
long time on this. It gave me a table
showing five opportunities. They were
kind of generic, you know, pet sitting,
dog washing. They weren't super niche. I
could have prompted it better. I could
have given it more reference data like
brush clearing, porch pumpkin
decorating, hole-in-one challenge, more
random niche ideas, and I bet it would
have spit out much better data for me.
So, that was kind of on me. But my big
takeaway from this one was the ability
to ask it questions and how quickly it

[37:02]
to ask it questions and how quickly it
responded. I love that it quickly found
YouTube videos and Reddit posts because
there's millions of subreddits out
there. You're not just going to go to
the car detailing one to find what you
need. You're going to find one in the
dog lover subreddit, right? People are
talking about all kinds of stuff in
these. So, I was very impressed with
this one, especially considering I could
have it use everything it knows about me
to make a 30-day launch plan for one of
those ideas. But the most impressive
thing it did in my opinion, which was
the one I had the lowest expectations
for, was do all that research on
powdered energy drinks and then make a
pitch deck for me and then make a better
pitch deck for me based on the reference
data that I uploaded in the Airbnb pitch
deck. This research was so good. You can
pay hundreds of dollars a month for
tools that do this. It is now free,
quote, free. It's part of what you
already pay for ChatGpt. And then for it
to make the pie chart and then for it to
break down the exact percentages of the

[38:01]
break down the exact percentages of the
complaints that it found that told me
that it actually knew what it was
talking about. It wasn't just BSing me.
All right, here we go. Here's your
redesign five slide deck patterned after
the Airbnb style loaded with personal
touches. Each slide uses coral accents,
clean layouts, and a blend of your story
and market facts. In case you didn't
know, coral is the color that Airbnb
uses. Grab the finished PowerPoint here.
Should we take a look? Clean energy for
real life. Healthy powdered drink by
true hustlers.
Okay. Chris is a 36-year-old. I'm 38.
Dad of four living in Dallas running in
raetball. Okay. All right. He needed
clean energy for long days and late
nights. Well, it is a late night right
now. So, podcast host. I don't know
where they got 26k following anymore.
$79 billion global energy drinking
market. There's the uh the pie chart
that it made for us. Okay. This does
look like the Airbnb deck, which was,
you know, in their defense, 14 years
old. It was great design for the time

[39:00]
old. It was great design for the time
and it's legendary based on how well
they optimized it to raise, you know,
hundreds of millions of dollars. Boom,
boom, boom, boom. Five slides, just like
I asked for. Okay. And for the final
task of doing this energy drink
competitive research, making a pitch
deck, I'm going to give it a 9.5 out of
10. I thought this was a simple task,
and it was, but it went the extra mile
for me. and blew my mind and just really
opened my eyes to what's possible with
Chad GBT agent. So now all you got to do
is go do stuff with this. 20 bucks a
month and you can have a team of PhD
employees at your fingertips. A team of
PhD employees at your fingertips for $20
a month. Did you not hear what I just
said? This isn't an ad. I don't work for
OpenAI. They don't know who I am, but my
mind is blown at the possibilities here.
So smash the follow button because this
took hours. Share it with a friend.
