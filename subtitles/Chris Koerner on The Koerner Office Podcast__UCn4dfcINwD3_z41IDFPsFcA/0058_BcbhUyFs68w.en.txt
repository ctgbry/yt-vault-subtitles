[00:00]
far so all right I'm going to go over
the deck it's pretty straightforward
most of our deals look about the same
our whole strategy is to buy parks that
are already performing well they're
probably under Market uh on rents and
they're probably pretty full or close to
it and those two things are correlated
um and then we we like to buy parks that
are solid on day one and then add value
over time and so we will not buy a park
that does not have the potential to get
to 750 Grand Top Line after expansion we
want to always have expansion
opportunities in the park because we are
confident in our ability to fill the
park so under Market rents good location
preferably Waterfront uh if possible
preferably amenity Rich if possible and
definitely the ability to expand and get
our Topline noi or our Topline Revenue
to 750 and and with an average 45%
expense ratio uh we know that we can get

[01:00]
expense ratio uh we know that we can get
our net profit to the 3 to 400s uh range
plus we'll take bigger Parks but it's
harder to find bigger parks at the cap
rates that we look for um John just
joined so I'm going to unmute
him hey John welcome hey hey thanks
Chris see no problem yeah you too I just
got him started I just showed them where
it was and I just kind of started to
talk about our overall thesis and I'm
going to go through the deck
cool so this is what the financials of
this park uh look like John I'm pretty
sure this is one of our smallest raises
ever and someone asked the good question
and he's saying what's the point like
why why rise 750 is that even worth the
paperwork in my answer John tell me if
I'm wrong is we've got a machine we've
got a well oiled machine and a good
system that we can plug these par into

[02:00]
system that we can plug these par into
and this park fit our buy box and it's
really efficient even at 50 Grand chunks
at a time to raise 750 on Parks like
this that right yep okay so 8% Pro so
first eight% of the return goes directly
to the LPS we're targeting a 3X multiple
within um three to five years our
strategy on everything is to refinance
within two to three years assuming that
rates eventually come down and at that
point LPS would receive the majority if
not all of their principal back wherein
they can stay in the deal for Perpetual
returns um this is kind of a higher IR
park for us which is great 30% we're
usually in the mid 20s and it's a very
very straightforward Park there's not a
lot of hair on it it's um it's a Well
performing a good Park on day one with
the opportunity to expand um starting
next year pretty amenity Rich we've got
a a pool river deck game room it's been
well cared for good pride of owners ship

[03:00]
well cared for good pride of owners ship
we actually found it Chris our
Acquisitions guy found it um because he
he saw a nice park in Georgia that
looked really good and the owner knew of
another seller in U North Carolina that
was listing with a broker and it was
about a week away from hitting the
market so we were able to snag the
broker before it ever hit the market put
in an offer and it never hit the market
so that's a testament to Chris Haynes
he's our acquisition guy and John I I
think he might be our secret weapon I I
spoke to him for a while yesterday he
was in law enforcement for 31 years
doing investigations he's got the
southern twang he drives a big truck
he's got the fifth wheel hitch on the
back he is kind he's a straight shooter
and he just speaks so well to these Park
owners that about right
John that's it you got it really likable
guy it's interesting how well the
crossover is how how seamless the
crossover is between a career police
officer and someone buying RV pars it

[04:00]
officer and someone buying RV pars it
just works It just
fits he and I visited a lot of parks
together too and there every you know
really nice parks to parks where I was
not I was a little nervous about getting
I let him get out of the
[Laughter]
car I bet yeah I bet he wasn't scared
he'd probably seen a lot
worse um it is a 56 unit site two of
those units are campgrounds along the
river 54 of them are RV pull through
sites got your standard 30 50 amps 70
foot max length which is nice because
that's that's longer than normal and um
it's just a good Park it's the closest
Metro is is Chattanooga still a couple
hours away like I showed earlier it's
just in the dead center between
Dollywood Chattanooga Atlanta Knoxville
all those beautiful cities
um this slide talks about our overall
strategy it's the same deck or it's the
same slot on every deck um we we strive
to return all of the principal within
three years and then um

[05:00]
three years and then um
and keep everyone in the deal John did I
miss anything
there no no I think that's good um and
this this
area of Western Carolina it's about 30
40 minutes from see you see brass toown
there um and some of yeah and some of
the so and actually right right down
into Georgia is near there's brass toown
bald um blairesville Georgia not far
from there that's my um I grew up uh
spent a lot of Summers there my grand
mother had a bed and breakfast and my
family still owns the property a decent
a pretty big property there so I I've
been to Murphy a bunch of times as a kid
and it's just it's a really pretty part
of the country you get a lot of um you
know obviously a ton of RV traffic
passes through there up you know going
Knoxville Eastern Smokies uh Asheville
uh down to Atlanta it's just a lot of
the roads pass through but so it's a
nice place to stop and it's a growing
area you get a lot you get a lot of down

[06:00]
area you get a lot you get a lot of down
in backers they call them where people
moving from New York down to Florida you
know the nor up north from down to
Florida and then Florida's a little too
hot and then they come back to North
Carolina like half halfway back and uh
so it's it's that kind of that kind of
that kind of place but I think I think
it's one of the prettiest parts of the
country and there's there's pretty
steady growth there and some of the
comps there there's not there's one
other park right near a c casino near
here that has significantly higher rates
so there's it's it's it's a nice part
really nothing we don't need to do
anything and it'll still cash flow out
of the gate I was surprised by how low
the rates were I even pulled that up 50
bucks a night for something along the
river in the
Smokies that's pretty crazy yeah yeah
it's it's low yeah what what has their
average occupancy been lately John I
didn't see that on the so they'll um so
they'll they'll summer spring summer
fall is a season there you it's
obviously the fall is actually beautiful

[07:01]
obviously the fall is actually beautiful
but if you think about the summer
they'll they'll run higher 80 90% plus
this is a more transient you're gonna
transient Park than some being a k it's
a KOA so KOA parks are typically more
transient and meaning people coming and
going and it's it's an area where in the
summer it'll it'll be 80 to 100% July
4th weekend Memorial Labor Day all those
it'll be it'll be full and you know you
charge more more more per night I would
I would we would increase the the
nightly rates especially on those
holidays if you're 100% you the summer
if you think of a year the summer is
basically 30% of the year so if you stay
full just for the summer in a transient
Park you're only at 30 29 30% occupancy
for the year you know if you annualize
that just that that part of the summer
uh is is about that but um if you do
well during that season you can you you

[08:02]
well during that season you can you you
can basically hit your Revenue Target
and make money so if you just kill it
and optimize your rates during the
season you'll do well in the off season
you could pick up some monthlies that's
typically what we do maybe about 30 40%
we'll keep as monthly and then you'll
you you may only be at
50% occupancy six you know maybe 60% on
weekends in in some of the offseason so
bouncing 40 to 60% occupancy off off
season and so on average you know you're
maybe depending on how you calculate the
transience you know uh um you know
you're you're 50 60% kind of annualized
there okay thank you while we're on this
slide would you mind talking about the
team a little bit and what we built here
at Blue metric yeah yeah so we I mean we
have it's it's it's a
in-house property management company we
have director of personnel a lot of

[09:01]
have director of personnel a lot of
hospitality experience I I don't think
there's many folks out there I know some
of the our competitors which are heavier
in other markets but in in the Tennessee
and surrounding states there's really
not a whole lot of anyone building an
organization like this so we have a land
development director his whole purpose
is to maximize the value of all our land
and like you look at this park there's a
nice creek there there's some water
there's some areas to expand you know we
can we can site build tiny homes for 25
grand um which is great and especially
when you you know you can rent them you
could recoup your money fairly fast on a
payback schedule the era and that's all
he does so we we're
seeing synergies doing the same type of
model on different Parks then we have a
director Personnel who came from Darden
Restaurants and he oversees everyone his
job is really kind of leadership and
oversee the team and make sure
everyone's delivering and building the
team um over this park this park will

[10:01]
team um over this park this park will
have Dean who's retired retired
military he this is actually near his
his home base uh which is you know we
call we basically deployed Dean to
oversee a number of our Parks he rolls
he'll roll through Kentucky into
Tennessee but comes back here so this is
his kind of like his backyard so this
park will be close to him and he can
he'll come in and maintain he's kind of
an enforcer you know he'll enforce brand
standards across across the parks that's
just some of the team and then there's
obviously people at the park level and
we have digital marketing partner and
other other other folks
involved and we had a question in the
chat if KOA provides any pricing
guidance or
oversight yeah they do and they'll
they'll on other Parks we've seen it we
have two other koas right now uh another
one we're converting to a KOA they'll
they'll get they'll do all they have a
whole every department and we've done
I've been to Montana at their
headquarters done KO

[11:00]
headquarters done KO
University uh we've had multiple people
on the team do that as well yes they'll
we'll sit down with them
and revisit the rates we'll have our we
have our assumptions on the rates
they'll they'll come through and really
they really help especially with the
dynamic pricing looking at what else is
going on in the area and how much we
should fluctuate rates on on the holiday
weekends and and they'll even and and
even things like firewood or propane or
some of those other things they'll
they'll weigh in on so they they give a
lot of guidance yeah it seems like our
strategy is less dependent on increasing
rates and more dependent on expansion
because if if we add a new pad site
that's an extra 60 bucks a night whereas
a 10% bump is an extra six bucks a night
right so it's kind of like our performas
don't even budget for that many rate
increases it's just the cherry on top
yeah

[12:00]
yeah
okay so we are big Believers in the RV
sector we saw mobile home parks um start
getting chased down about seven or eight
years ago by private Equity marinas
started getting chased down three to
four five years ago um campgrounds are
are getting chased down above 10 million
but we're not seeing a lot of
competition in this what we call the
messy middle Parks between two and10
million it's too big for a single family
home investor or or for your your
average investor and it's too small for
private Equity to really care so this is
where we're thriving the most is on
these amenity Rich parks that people
like me when I was buying parks in 2019
2020 frankly I was scared of these Parks
because it takes a big management team
to take care of all of these amenities
whereas we already have that so we might
as well keep rolling more Parks into
this
machine um RV sector is growing it's
taking advantage of four to five
different Mega Trends all at the same
time retiring Baby Boomers Millennials
love rving
um and we consider it a hedge against

[13:01]
um and we consider it a hedge against
the economy right now the economy is
doing well people are buying RVs and
they're traveling and we have a higher
ratio of short-term stats which are more
profitable whereas if or when the
economy tanks these are the cheapest
form of affordable housing people
unfortunately will have to live in these
full-time on a month-to-month or yearly
basis um you can dial back the amenities
and you can still cover your occupancy
rate by converting them to more
long-term Parks so it's just nice to
have a hedge against either type of
economic
situation um these are almost
exclusively mom and pop owned Parks most
of them are single Park owners we've
come across a couple parks that owned
two or three um as I said in the
beginning we're really committed to
expansion um we want the parks to say 80
to 95% full and we want there to be room
to expand so we can get our Top Line
over 750 um it needs to be big enough to

[14:00]
over 750 um it needs to be big enough to
justify full-time management this park
is on the smaller end of our Parks but
it's also close to our Tennessee Parks
it's close to one of our employees it's
much easier to roll uh park on the
smaller side into our system then it
would be uh to roll a smaller parking to
our system on another part of the
country this is our track record so far
um in business for 16 months John you've
been commercial real estate for 20
years yeah rounding up from 19 we we'll
go with
20 19 years um I've been in real estate
for 13 years in the I've been in the RV
mobile home park space for five years um
last year we acquired $30 million worth
of parks that has like the 50 million
dollar basis at this point um we we find
a lot of sellers somewhat offended by
our our offering or asking prices um

[15:02]
our our offering or asking prices um
because we we almost always buy at a 10
cap and um Montana was an exception
because it was a nine cap and it was
appraise at a seven cap that was still a
great Buy in a very Supply constrained
area but most of these parks are 10 to
13 caps um which is just a testament to
Chris and our acquisition team Chris has
a couple cold callers working for him um
and Chris has a goal to talk to five
people in in the space every single day
um and so he's just planting seeds all
day every day uh and finding parks and a
lot of these parks that we've been
finding lately just like this one are
not necessarily off Market but they're
just pocket listings um and I think in
Montana in that case that was actually
listed on the market and just happen to
hit our radar
right that's right yeah and we were we
were um I told them look look you know
sometimes it's looking near National
Parks or specific places but
um and just being there when the when

[16:02]
um and just being there when the when
someone's ready when the the time is
right for someone to
sell yep and Nathan asked is this park
uh mostly a short-term park or a
long-term Park I believe it's about 80%
shortterm that's right yeah okay um we
depreciate correct me if I'm wrong here
uh about two-thirds of the purchase
price year
one 60% right right that's right yeah
that's right lands and there's there's
been some bills Flo in in Congress to
Tinker it to maybe increase it but it
it'll be right around two-thirds of the
purchase price most likely yeah uh we
have never missed a a preferred payment
to investors um we we've been averaging
over 8% cash on cash here is a uh just a
graphic of where our parks are we're
trying to get this more and more dense
as time goes on uh we're closing another
one in Alabama
just Clos one in Tennessee right over

[17:01]
just Clos one in Tennessee right over
here um and then this is just this
outlines our
strategy refinance two to three years
exit in five to seven um whether that be
to private Equity or on an individual
[Music]
basis this speaks more to uh the
structure of this park most of our Parks
look about the same um it's a 7030 split
in favor of LPS up to 30% irr in this
case and then it adjusts to 6040 5 to
sevene hold period 3x Equity multiple I
think it's 3.05 X um an 8% preferred
return distributions are quarterly uh
beginning at the the next quarter after
close and formal updates are quarterly
as well k1s go out February
marchish right by Mar by March
15 this is a performa I don't want to
get too into the weeds I can send it out

[18:01]
get too into the weeds I can send it out
I'm happy to send out the Excel version
as well uh you can just see our strategy
laid out pretty clearly here we're going
to add 10 more RV pad sites and how many
more cabins was it
five we have five in there it's it's
possible it could shift potentially we
get one or two more in there but pro pro
for ra five yeah and John can you speak
about the the loans that we taking over
in this case yeah so uh yeah first
there'll be a a a first mortgage of 30%
down and then with the seller has we
actually have don't always get this but
sometimes we'll pitch other financing
there was a there's a I don't want to
call it second position really an
unsecured line of uh uh 6% for five
years interest only so that would allow
us to get more get more leverage out of
it out of the property and do do some of
the cap back so it's kind of it's kind

[19:00]
the cap back so it's kind of it's kind
of cool um we don't we don't have to
take it if we don't want it but that
that's something I pitch in our our
purchase agreement and uh um depending
on the property you usually you don't
get it but but it is it's an option for
us
here and Chuck asked is there a carry
forward entity
involved no I don't I um I assume he
means there's not there's not this is
just a oneoff
um you know we we do every deal every
every deal is a separate purchase
separate investors same man same
management company and team but there's
no um no cross collateralization
no this is how uh projected returns
would look so this says 100k this says
750 because it's a total raise so I went
ahead to the financials and um I fixed
that so this would be the projected
Returns on $100,000 investment um you
can see that they really uh ramp up in

[20:01]
can see that they really uh ramp up in
year two when we start adding the tiny
homes in the additional pad sites um the
refinance would recapture all of the
principle at that point um and then
those would be the quarterly payments
moving forward so this would be for the
entire raise and this would be for
100,000
yeah 615 down payment 61 closing cost 22
capex which is much lower than normal
because we have that $500,000 line of
credit available should we choose use it
6% 50,000 for the operating count and
total um credit investor only this these
are just kind of the uh the benefits of
investing in this park and most of the
Parks look the same this is our team and
and that's it
got a few more questions here

[21:01]
got a few more questions here
um the power and Sewer capacity exists
for the
expansion yeah so that that's where I
said we could do a little more but I we
haven't uh put it in there yet so uh
potentially we could have a little get a
little few more in there but yeah that's
that's usually where the often where the
Poo po poop goes is the limiting factor
without doing more without getting into
septic or leech fields or like your own
private um little pump without adding a
pump station which can add a chunk of
cost so we can we can at least do the
expansion we have on the
proforma yeah and there's
no there's no there's no there's no
repair capex needed that's what's nice
it's a pretty it's a clean Park so we
had um very limited we on the inspection
report very limited touchups coats of
paint sort of thing so that that was
that was nice about this park it's it's

[22:00]
that was nice about this park it's it's
been it's been well well
maintained and Matt ask if we can talk
more about expanding occupancy for the
cabins and tiny homes expanding
occupancy yeah yeah so they had good
they had good so the strategy becomes
they had good occupancy during the
summer can we place in a perfect in a
perfect what KOA and I've been through
the exercise with them before in the off
season if you could fluctuate
between 30 to 70% monthly versus
transient and and really get good at in
the offseason have those cabins be
monthlies and in the season have more of
them be available open free for for for
nightly that's how you can really and
then you you have your your peak season
and your shoulder season and then your
offseason if you can really play that
game well that's how you can really
really maximize revenue and it it really
you play with you know could it you
could almost double Revenue if you just

[23:01]
could almost double Revenue if you just
do it just right so uh that's a lot of
times it takes a year or two to really
or maybe even two seasons to really get
where people know and know some of the
local and and how do you do that you
know it could be contractors it could be
getting in with some of the the the
local the local military so Dean is
really good at that like if you just
some of the Facebook boards just where
you're playing that game of hey off
season you could yeah we rent those
cabins for the offseason you could you
know what 1,200 a month um you just stay
month to month um but you know come come
May um the rates change and you can just
fluctuate that with your rates but it's
it um that's that's a lot of the I think
that speaks to what he's talking about
the ex occupancy for for the cabins and
tiny homes but if you think about it
like in the summer you could charge 150
200 a
night depending so you don't need a lot

[24:00]
night depending so you don't need a lot
of nights to hit what you could be you
know less than 10 nights eight nights
you could be well above what you're
charging for a monthly so that's that's
the raid game it feels like every Park
we've purchased so far the the owners
run it year round with no strategy like
as if there are no seasonalities to it
right whereas if you if you do come in
there and strive to get long-term
tenants during the off season it can
make a big difference and they just they
don't look at it that way
yeah yeah I mean and it's it's a lot
sometimes too they may early on but they
a lot of them will try things and see
what sticks and that's that's I think a
lot of small business owners I've been
there you just try stuff and see what
sticks and what you can manage as like a
couple or an owner operator and you just
roll with that so
yeah Kenny is asking um what debt is in
place for the loan fixed or variable
what is the exit cap rate projected in

[25:00]
what is the exit cap rate projected in
the pro forma I know that's 8% and I
know if if there were a kind of a
private Equity exit it could be
theoretically lower than that uh and
then how much skin in the game is GP
putting in it's 10% GP commit on every
part what are the the the terms of the
debt I know the interest rate um eight
eight and a quarter 8.25 for the first
and then six and they're both they're
five years the first the first one has a
25 year rization but it's it's five
years so well it's it's it's fixed for
it's fixed for five years
okay pay a quarter fixed for five 25 am
5% interest only at 6%
interest uh what would you say is the
biggest risk for the
seal say it's it's
it's it's that I'm not it's an
established park it has a long history
we're buying a business and the real
estate with a history so it's really can
we deliver on the upside I'd say things

[26:03]
we deliver on the upside I'd say things
don't go as planned in terms of we can't
we can't really lease out those sites
it's it's really that that you know the
businesses ah we don't really operate
the expenses are what they are maybe a
little above what we projected incomes a
little below what we projected then
we're not really Distributing what we
intended I it's it's that in running
this business are we able to do it to
Pro fora that's I see it I don't it's
not a it's within a nice range like in
terms of downside
scenarios uh it that that's when you
play with the numbers you okay maybe it
only distributes 3% five perc and that's
that's that that those are the the
reasonable business risks to me are the
the real risks not you know there's not
a lot of natural disasters in the area
we'll have
insurance um it's a pretty healthy
desirable area pretty area to be so I
don't see major downturns in traffic

[27:00]
don't see major downturns in traffic
traffic Trends or people needing housing
or RV sites so um I'd say it's just that
op basic operational business RIS
doesn't go according to plan insurance
covers loss of rents for up to a year
correct in addition to the you know
casualty and damage and then what I like
about the risks in this business are
there aren't as many occupancy risks as
you see would see in like multif family
because you can convert these to more
long-term Parks like John said they're
more capex risks like just not being
able to get the expense ratio through
where we'd like to see it which is in
the in the 40s um artam asked I can I
believe I can answer this one tell me if
I I butcher it sorry this is a basic
question but I've only ever done tech
company investments before is this
selling equity in the business or is
this another mechanism I'm familiar with
raises where you have pre and post money
valuation how does this work so we are
putting the park the business everything
in an LLC um and then there will be

[28:00]
in an LLC um and then there will be
Class A shareholders which are the LPS
and the GPS and we are all Equity
holders in the LLC that owns the
park so little different are owners
going to hang on to operate after
closing for a
period no you know and you don't you
don't so this owner they actually have a
team there and they which is good now
they didn't always they a lot of times
you don't want the prior owner to hang
around uh there's a lot of it's just in
our experience it's hard they do give us
some hours of Consulting but that's more
so we could if some you know this or
that website or the utilities or there's
a key to shed you know we don't have
like you just want to make sure but we
try to get all that by closing you
really it can be a little thorny in our
experience just bringing on a prior
owner to stay on that they do their
things their way and they're attached

[29:00]
things their way and they're attached
and this is these are you know it's a
it's a business it's a piece of real
estate they they probably have been
attached to maybe it's been it's been in
the family a while so it's better just
it's easier just have a clean break and
in in in our experience in some other
operators out there especially because
we're rolling these up it we own two
koas already they all look about the
same I think the the problems can be
exacerbated if it is a long-term Park
and the tenants are friends with the
owners and it can get a little hairy
you're actually worse off if the owners
hang around uh for a
while um I think that's it do we have
any other
questions if not then uh we will call it
a day and I will send this out to
everyone uh the raise is going well so
far I think we're going to get full
pretty quickly and uh it's a good it's a
good Park I'm I'm excited and great
grateful to be a part of it
