hello welcome to episode five of Ker's
Corner today we explored seven different
things so the first caller talked about
a wedding venue and how to evaluate if
he should open a wedding venue or how
saturated is the market what other
ancillary Services could he sell at the
wedding venue second caller wanted to
buy a vending machine location biz on
acquire. comom and coincidentally I had
already spoken to the seller of this
business via email about a month ago uh
third caller wanted to talk about an AI
idea for large learning models for law
firms actually he's trying to sell like
basically an AI version of a training
manual to law firms fourth guy uh has
like a bunch of different side hustles
and he just wants to know which one to
focus on he has a community he has a
newsletter he also has a full-time job
that pays him pretty well the next guy
has a paid ads agency with one dentist
client and he wants to know how do I
find more customers the sixth guy or

[01:00]
find more customers the sixth guy or
sorry six girl she was a female wanted
to know about Twitter spaces is it worth
it does spaces work for growing in
audience and it was interesting because
we had this conversation on spaces and
the last person wanted to evaluate
opening a VA agency which Niche to chase
which Revenue model to chase it was
pretty interesting so seven callers in
total this was episode five if you're
listening on Spotify or apple podcast or
any podcast Please Subscribe like I just
I want to know if is this good if it's
good then subscribe if you're on YouTube
subscribe that'd be great I'd really
appreciate it we're going to switch up
the format next week on episode 6 we're
going to do more pre-submitted questions
so basically people will email me up
front they'll have a question and then
I'll vet them more that way there's no
dead space in between callers that way
the questions can be more curated they
can still ask it live I'm not going to
do prep beforehand we'll just know a
general outline of what people are going
to ask that way if people have a
question that's just not interesting

[02:00]
question that's just not interesting
then we won't let them on the show
frankly or if they have a question
that's very interesting then we'll put
it front and center that way only the
best content will make it here and we
won't have any more oh you're breaking
up oh like dead space and just cuz
spaces is fine but it's not perfect
there are some downsides to it so it's
just going to be a little more curated I
hope you like the format starting next
week but for now enjoy today's

Matthew Chris can you hear me all right
yeah is that Matthew yeah it's Matthew
hey good to talk to you man yeah you too
so the question I have isn't for my
business it's actually for my wife so
she right now is running a cleaning
business it does about $20,000 per month
it's going great but sometime over the
next year or two she wants to transition
to a different business and she has this
dream business idea for her which is it
would be the Quasi wedding venue like
part Maybe gift shop like ideally it's a

[05:03]
part Maybe gift shop like ideally it's a
couple of acres and she could do some
gardening and and sell some local food
host some Community classes local events
really with the intent of like making a
dent in the local community that's
something that she's really passionate
about and so as we think about making
that a reality like we know it'll be
fairly Capital intensive we have no
experience in real estate and we
definitely would want it to be
profitable and an actual business so it
could sustain itself so just as we're
starting to think through how we could
make this a reality I'd just be curious
to know how you would recommend we think
about and plan for
it okay so let's go back to the cleaning
business when you say in a year or two
what does she want to do with the
cleaning business when she transitions
to this wedding
idea yeah she would probably try and
sell it it's not in a place right now
where she could but I think she's

[06:01]
where she could but I think she's
progressing and could be in a place
maybe in a year where she could sell it
for at least a couple
hundred, okay and is that is it like uh
is she Outsourcing all the cleaning or
is does she have her own Crews that do
the cleaning yeah they're all
contractors and they yeah so she
actually runs the business in a separate
State it's run completely remotely okay
okay and 20K is Topline and it it's
somewhat Prof yeah about uh between 20
and 30% net is where it's sitting right
now okay cool and with the wedding uh
venue are you looking to buy an existing
building or build a building or buy an
existing wedding venue or repurpose a
different type of real estate yeah it
would be it would probably be buying
something existing that has some land
around it like I said if we ideally
could get a couple of Acres so that
could turn into more than just a wedding

[07:01]
could turn into more than just a wedding
venue but whatever is most like
financially viable is probably what we
would end up doing okay and are you
willing to say where this would be that
is very like to be
determined is it going to be near you or
will it be remote like the cleaning
business it would be where we're
living okay and so back to the original
question you're curious how like what
you could do to make this B for the
community and like a a nonprofit feel SL
passion project yet still be
economically viable yeah truth is it
would be a business first with kind of
the ancillary benefit of being able to
help the community okay and have you
done any research yet on what the the
competitive landscape looks like for
wedding venues in the year and would
weddings be like the
flagship product whereas everything else
like the garden the gift shop that would
just be for fun to serve the community
but the weddings pay the bills is that

[08:01]
but the weddings pay the bills is that
accurate that is just an assumption on
my end that wedding venues do would do
the bulk of the revenue the truth is I I
don't know it's it's possible like I
would think so Community classes local
events like they could contribute but
yeah probably the wedding venue okay and
have you already done research yet on
how like how competitive the wedding
venue Market is in your area we like
very well maybe moving to another state
in the next handful of years so it's
hard to do but so I don't have a good
answer for that and would the venue be
like where you're moving to or would you
be leaving that area it would be where
we're moving to and something that she
would want to really build a brand and
we'd probably be in that area for a
decade plus okay and have you have you
already used outs scraper before no okay
all right I think I've got your
prescription so I'm gonna give you the
rundown and thank you for calling in

[09:02]
rundown and thank you for calling in
sweet all right so I love the wedding
venue business I've done a quite a bit
of research here because I'm actually
seriously considering turning my own
house into a wedding venue at some point
long story short my house would be
probably better served as a commercial
property than as a residential property
and so I've looked into this business a
lot I love the business I think that one
wedding a month would could in my case
it could pay the bills it could pay the
mortgage and then anything after that
would just be gross margin so if I were
Matthew what I would do you don't have
to wait to move there I would get on
outc scraper and I would run a Google
map search for all of the wedding venues
in a you can really travel for a wedding
let's say 100 mile radius let's just say
I have no idea where he's moving to
let's say at Charlotte North Carolina
okay so I would find all of the ZIP
codes in 100 mile radius of Charlotte
North Carolina and I would run it out
scraper search it's really easy

[10:00]
scraper search it's really easy
userfriendly to get all the wedding
venues and then I would go find a
comparable Metroplex so go look at a
list of all the metroplexes in the
country by population size find one with
similar demographics and um similar
population so let's say let's say
Knoxville Tennessee and that's probably
somewhat similar and do another search
and then do that like two more times
similar metroplexes similar population
Siz similar cultures right because
Seattle Washington is very different
from Memphis Tennessee and then I would
use that data to determine a baseline
okay so let's just say Knoxville
tennessy can support one wedding venue
per 10,000 people and I wish I had this
research fresh I have a Google doc
somewhere with all this wedding research
I know there's I don't remember how many
weddings there are per year but then say
all right Knoxville Tennessee has half a
percent of the Nations population so I'm
just going to say all right there's a
million weddings per year that's 5,000
weddings per year in Knoxville Tennessee

[11:01]
weddings per year in Knoxville Tennessee
and they have 36 wedding venues okay so
that means every wedding venue is doing
however many weddings per day or per
month or per week or whatever and get
that Baseline put them side by side in a
Google sheet and say all right okay in
these other three markets outside of
Charlotte we can expect one venue to do
50 wedding per year and then that's like
phase one that's the easy part the
harder part is hopping on the phone with
a lot of these venues and saying Hey I
want to book a date or getting on the
knot.com a lot of times they will sync
their calendars with the knot and say
all right how booked is this venue and
why are they booked what's different
about them or is there just a ton of
demand and even the ugly venues are
booked and that way all right this
Baseline like this random Market over in
Knoxville Tennessee actually this could
really use a wedding venue based on the
research I've done get your Baseline and
then get on the phone find out how
booked are these guys in the future
maybe you learn that the average venues
booked out the next three months but not

[12:00]
booked out the next three months but not
six and then you find this one city
where the average venue is booked out
nine months and then do all that same
research in Charlotte and that way you
can see how competitive is the market
here or not and you might just learn
that it's oversaturated you might learn
it's undersaturated and then use that
info to make a decision this is this is
a big decision there's not a lot of
businesses that you have to go all in on
this kind of is I would not recommend
building a building I would recommend
buying one it's almost always easier toy
buy one below uh replacement cost than
to build one new and then find a
building that can be repurposed with
other stuff in case the wedding stuff
doesn't work out maybe as an Airbnb or
something like that and of course do
your pricing research but the most
important thing you want to do is find
out how saturated your Market is or not
and then let that guide your decision
because if it's oversaturated and you've
never done weddings before then don't
try to bank on the idea that ours will
be better because you just don't know
enough to know that everything looks
good on paper but when you actually get

[13:01]
good on paper but when you actually get
in the weeds sometimes you learn man
these wedding venues suck oh they're not
doing this they're not doing that and
you're 3 years into the business and
you're like oh that's why it seems like
they suck because this is a really hard
business I did the same thing with my
thirdparty logistics company it's like
oh wow no one likes their e-commerce
Fulfillment company no oh we could
change we could change the aim we're
going to do we're going to do flat fee
instead of variable we're going to do
this instead of this we're going to do
that and then two years in we were doing
everything that everyone else is doing
because they're doing all those things
for a reason so do the saturation
research find out how your Market looks
find a building that could be repurposed
as other stuff and then go all in and
then expect for the wedding side of the
business to be profitable without
anything else without the classes
without the garden without the gift shop
that way you can at least cover your
base and then anything above that the
true passion project plays can just be
uh cherry on top so that's what I would
do
hey this this moral that is hey how are

[14:02]
hey this this moral that is hey how are
you man I'm good I'm good yeah I figured
I was gonna wait and see what would
happen but sounds like um heat didn't
work out but I'll I'll be quick so I
came across a business on acquire. comom
and wanted to hear your thoughts on it
so basic premise is it's a
vending location finder business and so
the way it basically works is someone
that
looking for the location basically goes
to the site they have a free consult
with um the person that runs the
business and then after that they
basically pay 500 bucks up front the
person goes to work and looks for a
location and wherever they're located
once they find the location and secure
it they basically connect the person to
the business and then they get paid the
second $500 and then that's the end of
the story so wondering if you think this
is a a potentially good business to buy

[15:00]
is a a potentially good business to buy
you have any questions for me have you
ever emailed me about this I haven't
okay is this business listed for 16
Grand that's correct okay so the seller
of this business emailed me on February
1 asking me kind of the other side of
this question believe it or not small
world I actually did already meet with
the seller and and I had a conversation
with her yesterday yesterday actually
and it just I feel like has potential
but I don't know just wanted to hear
your thoughts and and see what you're
thinking yeah so what do you like about
this business and what do you scared of
I like it because I've called you before
but I'm a sales guy that aspect of the
business seems like very approachable
and it's okay this is like my wheelhouse
the other aspect I like about it is the
systems that she has in place and the
way she's doing things aren't the most
efficient and I feel like adding in a VA
potentially using tools like you've
mentioned before outs scraper things

[16:01]
mentioned before outs scraper things
like that would really cuz she hasn't
done any cold calling at all she's only
done emailing so a lot of that stuff can
be upgraded and then her website is
quite frankly crappy so that's something
thing too and then she's also not doing
any like paid search at all she's
getting everything through organic which
was obviously good but um yeah that's
another potential thing how is her
biggest competitor growing I have both
websites pulled up side by side you know
their strategy is the biggest competitor
what they're doing in the space is
they're not offering this done for you
aspect so what they're doing is they're
saying hey you pay us x amount of
dollars we'll give you a list of 200 to
300 people and you got to go call them
and then we'll give you a cold call
script we'll give you an email script so
obviously that weighs very easy for the
competitor but the price point is lower
at basically $200 or $300 and then
location finder is like a thousand bucks

[17:01]
location finder is like a thousand bucks
for one location if it's multiple then
it's a little less per unit so with this
business that you're looking at the the
kind of play is to just get on the phone
hit the payment find somewhere to put a
vending machine and then sell that lead
one time for a thousand bucks to the
operator exactly okay has it been
growing or shrinking for the last six
months it seems like she hasn't really
been putting too much time in it she's
launching another venture in the ending
space so I think this is sort of like
not really a priority and so it just
doesn't seem it has been growing I think
the potential is there it's just it is
like buying a job like we've like we've
heard before where when she gets that
person that wants to find a location it
basically will take anywhere from two to
three days to to find the location so is
it a th000 bucks only if you for sure
close a deal or is that just to sell the
lead no it's it's a yeah it's a a
guarantee so if you can't find a

[18:00]
guarantee so if you can't find a
location for that person in 30 to like
30 to 60 days 30 days is what's on the
website then it's basically a refund
okay have you thought of partnering with
a quinn Miller on something like this
like an influencer in the space I I did
think of Quinn because I know he's like
really big in the space and I know he
was actually on Twitter like when he
first started back in 2020 like selling
leads to people I know he was he would
basically just scrape and sell it for 50
bucks or 100 bucks so he was doing that
but I haven't reached out to him about
it no okay so here's what I would do if
I were you I would go find all of the
vending influencers in the space there
can't be more than a hundred Quinn is
obviously one of them I think most are
on Tik Tok try to get a hold of as many
of them as you can tell them about this
business I don't know how you want to
frame it maybe you want to say you're
gonna buy it you're thinking of buying
it you own it you're it's just you're
looking at it I don't know but what you
can do is get some sort of a referral
agreement in place what I love about the

[19:01]
agreement in place what I love about the
high touch aspect is that you got more
money to work with yeah you got to do
more work but you've got more money to
work with equals higher referral fees
for people like Quinn everyone that's
following Quinn not everyone but a lot
of people that are following Quinn or
the other influencers are trying to get
rich with vending machines right or
they're already doing vending machines
it is the most targeted marketed
marketing you could ever find you'll
have a higher Roi than both Facebook and
Google ads Bend I I would try to cut
three to five deals with guys like them
referral deals and maybe it's hey you if
you bring me someone I'll give you half
right I'll I'll give you like I'll
funnel half of this thousand bucks
through you or a third or whatever got
it and then see if you can just get
something like that pencil and then only
if you get that penciled then you go
ahead and buy the business because at
that point you're basically
drisk it's hard because it's a
Marketplace that's very high touch I I
can't think of a lot of other examples
like that
and so if you're confident on the

[20:01]
and so if you're confident on the
vending location acquisition side and
that's just a funnel that's just I feed
a thousand phone numbers into this
system and I know it's going to spit out
30 sales then check that box that's done
you just need to put some leg work into
that and the other side of it are the
buyers to these leads and I also love
this idea because it's uh geographically
driven it's like Thumbtack right thump
teac makes their business by selling the
same lead or A's list to to 10 different
h F guys 10 different Roofing guys but
what's brilliant about that is there's
500 home services and there's 5,000
little cities in areas and so you could
sell that hundreds of thousands of times
and it's similar with this you could
sell there's no shortage of markets that
you can find locations for but you need
buyers in those markets I think the
hardest part of this Marketplace is the
buy side because the sell side seems
like math to me but the buy side is all
right I just found this I just found
this gas station in SKC that has four

[21:02]
this gas station in SKC that has four
locations this is a great deal that's
4,000 bucks but I have no one in scnc
but Quinn Miller probably has four
people in Connect I got you so surely
one them is a buyer so you're saying
finding the location is is going to be
the easy part but the challenge is going
to be finding a a person in some remote
place that that goes to my website so
the best thing to do would be connect to
the influencers in the space figure out
a a kickback system for
and if I can get some agreements in
place then that would drisk it a lot
yeah because your vending Lo locations
are on Google Maps on outs scraper and
everywhere you can find them easily but
the buyers are who knows they're on Tik
Tok right exactly so go find them
perfect Chris I appreciate it man have a
good one no problem go bu that ranch
man working on it all right see you man
see you it looks like we already have
Tim in there Tim love to hear from you
and if anyone else wants to hop in line

[22:01]
and if anyone else wants to hop in line
that would be great hey Chris like you I
am uh in an interesting spot we're
driving with a carload of kids so you
might hear them in the background but
excited to share a little bit about what
I'm working on and really here I think
the big question for me is going to be a
little bit on marketing and a little bit
of next steps and to start poking some
holes in this idea because I think I
accidentally started a business nice
that's exciting yeah yeah if you want me
to jump in I could share what happened
but in in October of last
year I so for context I own and operate
a Chick-fil-A restaurant and my HR
leader was just getting overrun with
just really random questions from our
team members
employees little things like what's the
PTO policy how do I take off can I date
a fellow employee and I thought man chat

[23:00]
a fellow employee and I thought man chat
chpt would be a really cool tool to have
to solve this and so I thought man if I
could just upload all of our policy
manuals and I could upload some of our
training materials and then just send a
link to my team instead of them asking
and taking up time from my HR Director
what if they could just ask chat GPT so
I went and attempted to do that and
honestly did the job but didn't do it
super well and then just through my
experience I got a lot I just had a lot
of concerns around the Safety and
Security of uploading potentially
proprietary information to chat GPT so
anyway long story short I mentioned to a
friend of mine who had started his own
AI company a few months back and we
built a tool where now you can upload um
large PDF really of any size now in the
last couple days even multiple PDFs and
you can ask questions of those PDFs and
we are are working on a beta right now I
think maybe close to maybe 30 people on

[24:01]
think maybe close to maybe 30 people on
the beta testing it out but we've got a
lot of really interesting responses from
people who are in a lot of different
Industries who've said the concept and
idea of being able to create your own
database of PDFs and documents that's
safe I call it like you give it the
cloak of
invisibility and allow anybody that you
share that link with ask questions of it
could be really useful whether it's
lawyers that are trying to look at
massive amounts of data and quickly look
through all their PDFs and documents or
it's somebody like me who runs a
restaurant we're trying to figure out
how to Market it who should we go after
what should we charge yeah there's just
a there's a lot of uh I think there's
more questions than anything else after
having started this what the 30 people
that are using it what are those people
are they business owners and how did you
find them it's a mixture of yeah it's a
mixture of people so far so I would say
about 10 of them are lawyers it's been

[25:00]
about 10 of them are lawyers it's been
very interesting started through myself
and then Jared I would just guess I call
them co-founder Jared knows quite a few
lawyers and then I had a few lawyers
just reach out to me via Twitter when I
posted about this on Twitter so just
randomly and said hey what you're
describing is something we'd like to use
we have a lot of concerns uploading
things to chat GPT or they were telling
me that chat GPT would make up case law
it just fake case law and so if they
were able to essentially feed the back
end this would be really helpful so I'd
say about 30% are lawyers we have a lot
of academics so people who are doing
their masters or PhD work they're on
there and then the rest would be just a
conglomeration of business owners Etc so
that's been really interesting the
lawyers piece has been probably the most
fascinating thing to uncover so you
weren't looking for lawyers that's just
who happened to DM

[26:00]
who happened to DM
no that's exactly right that's exactly
right I was blown away that's been the
case and which is interesting because I
just assume that lawyers wouldn't touch
AI because it's the type of thing that's
coming for their jobs so maybe this was
an answer to them of hey we can actually
still utilize it and leverage it dozens
and dozens and dozens of PDFs could be
really helpful for I assume for a lawyer
we're still learning this this is just a
few weeks in that's been the thing that
surprised me the most so do you see this
ending up as not just being an HR
software but as an llm software for
whatever seems to have the most demand
for
it yeah we like one of the thoughts we
started have is could you just
essentially build a tool and have an API
and it plugs into whatever database you
want that's been one route the other has
been what if we just completely pivoted
and said let's just get a ton of law
firms on this and be the number one

[27:00]
firms on this and be the number one
provider of llms and like a safe way to
use llms for lawyers and could you get a
law firm to pay a thousand bucks a month
to subscribe to this powerful tool that
we can just set over top of whatever
database that they want to control and
have it safely be used and so that's
been the one side and then we also I
forgot to mention this Chris is and I'm
on the marketing side there's some I
would say competitors in the space but
they're that would say they're a little
bit boring it's read my PDF or
pdf. and they just sit on top of there's
a Chrome extension for chat gbt this is
its own yeah this is its own thing it it
stands on its own we are tapped into the
open AI API but on The Branding side we
decided to call it DOC You Sage and tap
into this idea of Wizardry the little
Harry Potter feel I've been describing
to people I've said hey look we offer
the death Hallows when it comes to llms

[28:01]
the death Hallows when it comes to llms
we've got the Harry Potter everybody's a
Harry Potter fan like the Deathly
Hallows you've got like the the cloak of
invisibility very very important so
that's that Safety and Security you have
the resurrection Stone which is that in
the Elder Wand are different elements of
AI and its ability to wield massive
control but then also to bring back from
the dead all this information at any
given moment so we've tried to Market in
that way as well okay cool I think I've
got all I need so I'm GNA a analysis and
we'll catch you later love it thank you
Tim cool my pleasure all right so I love
this idea I I consider this like a an AI
rapper or a chat GPT rapper which that's
not a pejorative that's fine so in
co-founders we're doing something
similar with our company voltera where
we're doing this for skilled nursing
facilities and they upload all of their
medical records and then our software
scans it and says hey you need to be
billing for this you need to be billing
for that so it it

[29:00]
for that so it it
basically turns a medical biller into a
super hu superhero medical biller so
we're doing this for skilled nursing
facilities specifically so they can save
more money by billing for codes that
they're currently missing because right
now in skilled nursing facilities these
medical billers are just doing control
find control find and they're missing
stuff okay so I'm I I like this because
this is a thing this is you're not
inventing something new but I do think
the
more this is becoming commoditized so I
think you need to find a niche within a
niche like we did right our Niche was an
llm for skilled nursing facilities
specifically so they can save more money
by billing for more things now even
though that's a niche within a niche
it's a massive market so I think you
should go with the legal route because
that's that's coming to you already so
take that signal as a good sign and then
I would leave your branding open-ended

[30:00]
I would leave your branding open-ended
on the front end point it towards the
legal system but leave it open-ended and
you don't really want to call it a a
read my PDF or a chat bot because a lot
of these law firms like it's just going
to look like any other thing as you
already suggested so I would have just
like a features page with two to five
different features after getting
feedback from these 10 lawers that have
already reached out like maybe they
could upload all of their previous cases
and their pargal could just ask it
questions like hey what was this one
case or hey what could what did we learn
from all of our 2021 cases that we could
apply to this case and but I would
really you you want to position yourself
as the expert and so I don't think you
should make it easy for them to upload
documents I think you actually need to
add some strategic friction to where
they send you all the documents and then
you upload them that way you can hold
some power and it's not it's it's the
equivalent of when I had my iPhone
repair shop and someone would bring in

[31:01]
repair shop and someone would bring in
an iPhone 4 with broken back glass and
it was literally a 20 second repair
would say all right it's going to be a
couple hours okay I'll just go run some
errands and they we would have it fixed
by the time they started their car but
you're introducing some strategic
friction to make you seem more valuable
than you actually are I would also
suggest that you look and do Claude
instead of open AI API because we found
after much trial and error Claude to be
a better llm for stuff like this than
open ai's um API so just to recap I
would look into Claud I would stick with
the lawyer angle I would put three to
four features on your website and those
will be three to four niches within the
legal Niche and then whatever people are
gravitating towards eventually change
your branding to make that one thing the
niche within the niche because maybe
it's uploading Texas case law or maybe
it's uploading whatever state they're in
case law or maybe it's uploading car
crash case law or something to where the
pargal or the associates or whoever can

[32:01]
pargal or the associates or whoever can
just learn from it and ask it questions
and I think you should charge like a
very low amount to start so you can
capture market share like 100 bucks a
month which will be nothing to a law
firm and then once you're really
ingrained in their system and people are
asking it questions on a daily or multi
times a day basis you could end up
charging whatever you want that's what I
would do if I were you but I love the
idea I am going to read a question from
one of our listeners I will keep his
name um confidential so this guy says if
you were me what would you cut and what
would you double down I'm doing too many
things that aren't driving enough
Revenue he has a full-time job and then
he has a bunch of side hustles so his
full-time job pays him 98 Grand a year
his bonus potential is 30 grand on top
of that he has a side hustle of an email
list with 4,000 people 50% open rate 5%
click-through rate his LinkedIn
following is 30ish th000 his X following
is a couple thousand he does sponsored

[33:00]
is a couple thousand he does sponsored
posts that bring about 600 bucks a month
and his newsletter's ads his newsletter
ads bring about 200 bucks a month and
then he has a community that brings
about 200 bucks a month and then he does
some Consulting that brings about 1,500
bucks a month and then he also does some
other Consulting for
solopreneurs so he's basically asking
what do I do do I quit my job do I pick
one of these side hustles do I keep
doing exactly what I'm doing and I get
this question a lot it's tough because
he's tasted Both Worlds the convenience
of the corporate world and not really
having to do a lot and getting that
check every two weeks vers the high
upside potential of the the grind the
the side hustle to me I would go all in
of all these things so he's got LinkedIn
following and X following sponsored post
newsletter ads he's got a community he's
doing some
Consulting I would go all in on the
community uh it's seems to me like he's
not monetizing his community a month 200

[34:01]
not monetizing his community a month 200
bucks a month from 40,000 followers I
feel like there's a half a dozen
different Revenue models where he could
make a lot more than that maybe it's
he's not charging enough maybe it's he's
not offering enough value and so even if
it's 10 bucks a month if there's just
not enough value in there then the price
doesn't matter because a community take
takes time so in a sense it's almost
better to charge $500 a month and offer
more value because then people feel like
if I'm paying this much for a community
then it's going to be a self-fulfilling
prophecy and they're going to put more
time and effort into it and they want to
make it worth their money more it's like
a a Planet Fitness membership You' pay
10 bucks a month you don't go but if you
pay 300 bucks a month for equinox you're
G to go just two different models so it
seems like he's doing the Planet Fitness
model without the other side of the
equation Planet Fitness they offer a
bunch of value it's nice clean gym free
pizza they want to keep you fat free
Bagels they want to keep you fat but

[35:01]
Bagels they want to keep you fat but
very very cheap and so I think you
either got to crap or get off the pot
you gotta go all in on Planet Fitness
and keep it cheap but offer a ton more
value than what you're currently
offering or you got to go full Equinox
and offer a ton more value and expect
people to contribute a lot more to the
community thus making more valuable but
also paying a lot more for that
Community that's what I would do all
right I've got one more question I'm
going to cover from a listener this guy
says I do Facebook Instagram and Google
ads as a freelancer I'm transitioning
into this from being a professional
photographer he says I've gotten most of
the certificates through meta and Google
and I have some experience running these
campaigns for a dentist who is a family
friend I'm really looking for a way to
land more clients but I don't know where
to look and most of my cold Outreach
doesn't result in anything are there any
niches that you have in mind where I can
help businesses generate leads through
meta ads and Google ads I think the

[36:01]
meta ads and Google ads I think the
answer is right in front of you you're
already doing this for a dentist dentist
is like the best category to sell to
they all want to get rich quick through
something outside of Dentistry that's
why they're very hesitant to invest in
real or they're very willing to invest
in real estate deals or agencies because
they like a lot of people they have it
in their head that if they pay an agency
2,000 a month that they're going to
deliver them 20,000 a month on one hand
dentists are over saturated when it
comes to agencies on another hand they
seem oversaturated because dentists are
so willing to pay agencies so if you
already have a client in one of the best
verticals to sell agency work into then
I would sit down with him he's a family
friend which is great because family
friends are the most willing to pay you
money and say hey can we go over like
how this is actually helping you is this
offering a lot of value to you if so
what like specifically like I want you
to tell me exact L what Revenue came in
your door that we could directly

[37:00]
your door that we could directly
attribute to my ads to what I've done
for you get a case study and then ask
him because all these dentists have
other dentist friends can you can I do
this for free for one of your friends
for 30 days just to see if it it yields
any fruit try to get two or three people
to do it for free they're just going to
pay for the ad spend you're going to do
all the leg work you can literally copy
and pce the campaigns swap out the
geographies if it's working if it's
working then great and cop copy and
paste the campaigns do it for free for
30 days and then start charging and then
only do agency work for dentists that's
what I would do your customer
acquisition can be handled they're all
in these Facebook groups you can go
through the moderators of the Facebook
groups I think that's a great business
to be in hey Lauren are you there yes I
am I actually had a couple of questions
for Tim but since I've got you guys I'm
actually really curious what are your
thoughts on an optimal way to build out
client or customer engagement across
businesses through spaces and I say that

[38:01]
businesses through spaces and I say that
because um I'm someone who has followed
different influencers or professional
development folks like Tony Robbins and
Dean grazioso and I really appreciate a
lot of the platforms and the audiences
that they have developed to this point
but I've noticed that seems to be a bit
more Facebook and Instagram heavy and
when I look at the engagement of many of
these figures are often authors like the
guy who wrote Atomic habits and what not
I don't see them engaging on Twitter or
on X the same way so I'm curious what
you've observed in how you have
leveraged X that may give you an edge
compared to other individuals in a
similar feere but not necessarily on
this
platform so are you asking this
specifically with the intent to sell
something to the James clears of the
world or to use it for your own
Corporation what is your end goal with
this
I think how to grow and build it for

[39:00]
I think how to grow and build it for
myself in building kind of a consulting
or coaching kind of a platform and
business but in observing other
individuals who have gone before and
used other platforms and I don't see
additionally adopting uh X in a a
heavier or strong
capacity observing how at least you have
leveraged it I'm curious what you have
found works for you and if you have
tried the other plat forms or what makes
you lean on X and as a kind of a
practice that you would continue to
promote or apply for yourself that you
found Works uh for your business here
yeah great question I think that every
platform serves a very specific audience
so X has worked for me because I like to
write and I like to consume content on X
and it just n that just naturally means
that I'm finding followers and
connections on X that like the same
things and so for someone like James
Clear of atomic habits he might and are

[40:01]
Clear of atomic habits he might and are
you insinuating that he's not leveraging
x to the full potential that he could be
is that what you're saying candidly with
James Clear I actually feel like he is
more present on X than many authors like
him so whenever I talk with people in
masterminds or other focuses on
professional development there's always
the applied I've read Atomic habits and
I've read the miracle morning and I've
read how Elrod or other figures like
that and so I think James Clear actually
does have a stronger presence on X but I
don't even see him hosting spaces so
when I look at someone like Tony Robbins
or Dean graziosi or Jenna CER or Jasmine
star those people don't seem to be on X
and seem to lean on other social media
platforms so there seems to be an
opportunity for growth in utilizing X
because it's not as highly adopted a
platform in that world old so having
observed and followed your threads for a

[41:01]
observed and followed your threads for a
while I'm just curious what you have
found works for you on this
platform like why it's been successful
for me yes that's a good question like
I'm an introvert right I I would prefer
to write than to be on short form video
what I have noticed with this kers
corner experiment is it's extremely hard
to transfer followers from one platform
to another if I have a newsletter with
6700 people on it it's got a 60% open
rate Great Click rate all the metrics
are great but that converts like a
fraction of a percent to a Spotify
follower or YouTube subscriber for
whatever reason right like these readers
are used to consuming my content in that
format whether it's a newsletter or on X
and that's just their habit and it's
just really hard to transfer people over
and so when you see someone any Creator
or any influencer that has a big

[42:01]
or any influencer that has a big
platform in one area but nothing or very
little in another area it's there's it's
one of two things either they're missing
out on a big opportunity or whatever
they're pitching or selling or talking
about it just doesn't fit well on that
other community one person that I've
seen do that really well is Cody Sanchez
she started on X but now she's
everywhere she has a million uh YouTube
subscribers she's got she's everywhere
all but I think what that took was a
full-time content team cameras all the
time paid ads like just going Allin
going hard which I am not doing and so I
think it's really hard for someone like
me who's like doing an experiment let's
see how this goes to to grow on other
platforms versus someone who's willing
to invest a ton of time a ton of money
in going to all the platforms at once
when they've already made a name for
themselves on one of the platforms
are there any tricks that you have found
in drawing an existing audience or

[43:03]
in drawing an existing audience or
building hype or getting adoption
whether that's through co-hosts or
Advanced promotion or anything like
that I don't know I'm still learning
I've got 70 something thousand followers
and 41 of them are listening right now
that's a pretty bad conversion rate and
so I I think this is really efficient
because the podcast side of this is
growing really fast the I say really
fast is growing growing week over week
every episode gets more and more
downloads the YouTube side is growing
slowly but I've had less listeners on
Spaces every week since I started the
first week was like 90 concurrent and
then it was like 80 and then 60 and then
45 and right now we're at 44 so maybe
we've bottomed out but even though I'm
here doing spaces this is only my fifth
time ever doing it and the jury's still
out in my opinion like the jury's out
for me if spaces is going to be around
in five years if this kind of this two a
podcast or radio format is has really

[44:00]
podcast or radio format is has really
has legs or if we're too early or if
we're too late I don't know what I do
know is that video spaces are performing
really really well and I actually tried
to make today's space a video space but
it it was being very buggy we ran a test
on another account and it just was not
working right when people do like audio
only spaces let's say they normally get
50 concurrent listeners they'll get 500
concurrent Watchers if video
and so I I I think that has more of a
future than audio but I wish I could say
I was an expert or I've been doing this
longer but I really don't know I do it
because these are conversations I'm
gonna have anyway if I'm gonna just have
a podcast then I might as well do it on
spaces and then I can just repurpose
that same content but I don't do it
because I think it's like it it builds
more engagement or more loyal followers
I that's my thesis but the jury's kind
of still out you know what I'm saying
yeah that makes a lot of sense and I
hadn't heard that observation about the

[45:00]
hadn't heard that observation about the
video conversion here on Spaces before
so I will definitely keep my eye on that
thank you so much for letting me throw
you a couple curve balls I didn't mean
to throw you no this was great thank you
for coming in yeah
absolutely Chris hey
Clifton yeah so second time on thanks
again for having these spaces for us
absolutely yeah so I see a lot of these
agencies popping up for Global Tal SL
virtual
assistance I'm just wondering what your
thoughts are on that is it going to be a
race to the bottom on price should if
it's a good idea you should one pick a
niche like a niche and focus not go too
broad what kind of how do you handle
objections like a business that's
telling you that they could just go on
online jobs. pH themselves like what
value can you add as an agency owner so
so great question we are in the very
very early Innings of these VA agencies

[46:01]
very early Innings of these VA agencies
it seems like we're not it seems like
we're saturated because if you're on
Twitter then every other week someone is
announcing their VA agency I I think
we're still very very early because if
you go walk around an average work force
and throw around the acadm VA no one
knows what you're talking about if you
say virtual assistant they probably
think you're talking about AI or some
app so I think that's great for what
you're looking at at doing what I think
is tough is differentiating yourself I
don't think you're competing with
onlinejobs.ph or upwork or any of them
because just like there's always going
to be a world for indie.com and there's
always going to be a world for
recruiters I think there's always going
to be a world for upwork there's always
going to be a world for VA agencies
right A lot of people just want their
handheld and so in this world you can go
one of two routes you can go pay me
upfront 35% of their annual salary which

[47:01]
upfront 35% of their annual salary which
is going to be like three to four grand
which is a pretty big chunk for a small
business owner or it's going to be I'm
GNA handhold your VA for you and
upcharge them just like temp agency
would do here in the US so I'm GNA pay
them $5 an hour and I'm going to charge
you $8 an hour and I'm going to take a
cut that is an easier sell sale because
there's no big upfront payment but it's
a harder business because you're
handholding these vas all over the world
so what business would you prefer to be
in with that in mind I would prefer to
be in the second one and I was actually
thinking of
Outsourcing the back end of interviewing
and handling the data day to someone
like John matzner or or the like and
I'll focus on the front end of finding
businesses here to sell
to yeah so that's great so you're
basically going to use John matzner to
to wh label all the work and then you're
just going to do customer acquisition
and hand them off yeah how does that

[48:01]
and hand them off yeah how does that
sound that sounds great I think what you
should you should do is just make a card
template a card website and literally
copy and paste that site with 10
different 10 different sites 10
different offers and we provide virtual
assistance for piano tutors we provide
virtual assistance for graphic designers
we Pro like whatever and then just start
hitting the pavement and seeing what
resonates and what doesn't and then
eventually go all in on that one Niche
or is it better to find a like a make a
partnership with a VA agency that's
already established and get a commission
for each sale how's that different than
what we're talking
about and
and I guess you know because you're
still having to acquire customers right
it's the same job on my end but it's a
little bit different John doesn't say it
as if it's a commission it's more like
he'll fulfill the backend for
use Google ads for this there's so many

[49:00]
use Google ads for this there's so many
little underutilized under monetized
keywords on Google ads I think you
should start with semrush or mos.com and
find out like what people are searching
for and let that guide your
decision-making on what 10 or five
landing pages that you put out there to
the world and then simply push paid ads
to it and see what your cost per clicks
are see what your click through rates
are how many people are booking calls
with you um and just function as a uh
customer acquisition engine that just
feeds someone like John matzner and
really there's so many different facets
to this business that if you can hone in
on customer acquisition on a specific
Niche or more than one inch then you can
make a lot of money and you don't have
to do any of the Fulfillment it's like a
Leen agency right you're just handing
everything off because I'm looking for
the easiest way into this because I do
have a full-time job at the moment and
and for me to do both ends would be
much so I'm trying to think of the best

[50:03]
much so I'm trying to think of the best
model that I would have to do the least
work and also if maybe you have a niche
in mind that might be the best instead
of testing 10 out or I should go the
root of testing out 10
niches I would use the niche that has
the most money like the niche that
directly correlates to revenue or the
niche that has a binary outcome like for
instance let's look at the fractional SE
Suite industry it's much much harder to
sell uh a CMO a fractional CMO Chief
marketing officer position than it is to
sell a fractional CFO position because a
CFO is he has a very defined role he's
going to do he's GNA show you the
numbers he's GNA do the pnls he's gonna
act as a controller act as a bookkeeper
whatever they need him to do and it's
very clear if the business owner gets
the numbers at the beginning of the
month then he did his job if he doesn't

[51:00]
month then he did his job if he doesn't
then he didn't whereas a marketer is
like all right we're doing this campaign
and I'm talking to this partnership
opportunity and this influence and it's
are you doing a good job because a lot
of times with marketing it takes months
or years to really attribute Revenue to
the right place and so I look at this
the same way you want to find the niche
where you can very clearly point to your
VA adding x amount of quantifiable value
to that business owner or that business
anything that's nebulous or creative is
just tough I think that's why if you go
to support shepard.com and you if you
just click at the the dropdown menu
whatever is at the top is probably what
they're selling the most of and that's
usually bookkeeping and graphic design
because influencers need x amount of
short form videos edited per week and
it's very clear I got them done you're
awesome you're doing a great job and
business owners need their books done
every month it's very clear whereas if
you go to the bottom of that drop down
you're going to see more specialty
things like even executive assistant or

[52:02]
things like even executive assistant or
virtual assistant or even paid ads
because there's just it's nebulous and
it's hard to quantify if they're doing a
good job so I would not try to reinvent
the wheel if you want to know which
Niche is best just copy paste what these
other guys are doing what they're
pushing like what are their case studies
saying how many case studies do they
have on other Industries vers verse not
and then gravitate towards that
yeah that's good advice thank you and as
far as the easiest way to get into this
is this like how you were saying before
to just make the sales and Outsource the
back end of the interviewing and the
hiring and the day to day okay yeah I
think
so okay sounds good thank you so much
yep thanks for calling in okay all right
if we don't have anyone else we're at
the hour so we're going to end this
thank you for joining thank you for
listening I appreciate your time and we
will touch base next week
