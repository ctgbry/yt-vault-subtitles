[00:00]
so let's go back to the beginning So Co
happens you've got more time to work on
your own lawn you figure it out or at
least you're cracking the code I know
it's a work in progress you start
talking about it it's a very visual
product what does your first customer
look like how did you acquire them how
did you know what to charge what did you
[Music]
charge okay so a few weeks ago I get a
DM on Twitter and this guy says Chris
you need to look into lawn leveling I'm
like okay lawn leveling whatever I just
got my lawn leveled in Austin Texas and
this guy rolled up and AMG and he
charged me thousands of dollars my lawn
looks amazing I love it but I've never
heard of this industry and he said he is
booked through the summer you got to
look into this I'm like okay this is my
type of DM so not only did I look into
it but I found that exact guy that he
was referring to in his DMS not some
other lawn leveling business but this
one in Austin that has been growing like
crazy so I like talking about blue color
businesses Home Service businesses I
love that space a lot I thought you
would like this I think this is a niche
that is going to start blowing up it's

[01:00]
that is going to start blowing up it's
interesting hearing what the actual
business owner had to say about that
Niche he kind of feels two different
ways about it and he thinks you should
approach it in a very specific way if
you were to start a lawn leveling
business in your area nonetheless let me
know in the comments if I should do more
kind of profiles of Home Service
businesses like these especially ones
that are less common and I will I'll do
more because I love it I love learning
about business so enjoy hey how are you
man good how are
you good I know this is random but I got
a DM on uh Twitter and this guy's like
dude have you heard of the lawn leveling
business I'm like no I didn't know that
was thing he's like you need to look
into this this is a cool business dude
it all started from the pandemic it
really wasn't a business prior to the
pandemic you just kind of fell into it
yeah well I started following a YouTube
channel right I was working on an old
rig following grass how to cut our yards
like golf courses right and pandemic hit
and when we all had time to stare at our
yards b a real mower used one started

[02:00]
yards b a real mower used one started
cutting my yard started changing how I
cut it you know that's when we figured
it out I was like this yard's not really
that level so I hired a company local to
come out and level it they didn't really
do what I thought they should have done
they just started getting the wheels
turning I was like man what if I made a
business out of cutting yards like this
you know I just started going into all
of it right just started chasing that
rabbit and was using next door to filter
out people I was like hey if you have
this yard how much would you pay a month
did like a poll on it just took off from
there a like a poll on next store yeah
yeah okay so let me say if I understand
this right you working on an oil rig you
started leveling your own yard you
learned how to on a YouTube video and
you're like oh this is cool it's
actually kind of fun and then you just
start asking around like anyone else
need this well yeah so everybody thought
I was going to kill my yard they're like
are you gonna kill your like are you
gonna kill your yard what did you put
all that material on there for man I
need to smooth it out because it doesn't
cut like it should then they seen the
results of of like how it looked

[03:02]
results of of like how it looked
fake and how green it was and how clean
and manicured it was and so like the
perception right for everybody
everything changed and it was like well
hey my neighbor got into it it just
snowballed from there see I I love that
you said that that everyone thought you
were going to kill your yard because
I've seen that same kind of polarization
happen in other Industries like for
instance I did a podcast with a guy that
owns a pressure washing company and it's
very polarizing cuz a lot of people
think that the bleach that he sprays is
going to kill all the plants and it's
illegal and he's breaking regulations
and he's not and it's all in compliance
and in code but like just the fact that
people freak out over pressure washing
makes it a really good business because
it gets people talking about it and it
gets them fired up and that brings
eyeballs to it and that means he can get
more customers so you're out here
seemingly killing everyone's yard by
dumping crap all over it and they're
like what is what and they stop and they
listen and they look and they learn and
then next thing you know they're a
customer yeah that's basically right

[04:01]
customer yeah that's basically right
that's basically how it went it's just
scaled from there I mean I really didn't
know a whole lot I knew different types
of grasses I knew a couple weeds I mean
it literally is a rabbit hole it's
Allison in the Wonderland thing you fall
down that hole it's addicting you know
you you start getting the appreciation
from people of like hey how's my grass
look how do I make this better how did
you do that and so you show up every
morning when you pull up to your house
every day and you see your grass look
like that I mean it automatically puts
me in a good mood like it does because
it's clean it's short and there's so
many things about it that people don't
really understand like we don't deal
with a lot of bugs in my grass because
I'm not cutting it like two three inches
where a bunch of bugs and things live in
there and so there's just so many things
that people don't really understand like
how nice it is to really have it yeah
like the aesthetic of it reels them in
and then the actual the the more
tangible benefits are what closes the
deal sure exactly and it gets easier
like it's been a work like I've been

[05:02]
like it's been a work like I've been
working on my yard for four years and
I've got it to the point to where I just
have to put down nitrogen only like we
just pulled a soil sample on my yard
because that's generally like where this
business has gone for us is that I don't
know what anybody has done to their yard
prior and I don't know what it needs but
if I pull a soil
sample it gives me an idea of what I'm
working with because everybody's yard's
different some people don't even have
material under their yards anymore today
like contractors and homebuilders that's
the number one corner that they cut is
material and like so we pull Soul
samples that gives me a road map of how
to make sure the thir yard gets to how I
got my yard and were you like a freak
about your yard before all this or were
you just kind of an average okay what do
you mean like a freak when I started
making my good or yeah exactly yeah I I
was really tied about it at first and I

[06:00]
was really tied about it at first and I
think most people get that way because
it's your pride and possession right
like you're out here in the heat 100
degree weather you're moving it's 2,000
pounds per ton right so if you got 10
yards of material that's 20,000 PBS of
material you're sitting there shoveling
all day putting it out putting in work
sweating scalping it's a lot of work and
so when you get people that are walking
on it you get all guarded right like a
get off my yard or you're protecting
that because it's so clean but started
thinking about is like it's a golf
course they drive golf carts and they
hack jobs all over Fairways so I bought
like a divot bottle and I put uh 8020
mix in there and every time there's a
mark for my dog scratching or whatever
my kids they run with cleats and
practice soccer you know you just go
back there and fill it in it's grass
it's going to recover and so I'm way
more relaxed on it now being four years
into it than I was before

[07:00]
into it than I was before
okay so let's go back to the beginning
So Co happens you've got more time to
work on your own lawn you figure it out
or at least you're cracking the code I
know it's a working progress you start
talking about it it's a very visual
product what does your first customer
look like how did you acquire them how
did you know what to charge what did you
charge so that's the thing right so
that's where the poll came in right was
collect data collect information I know
what The Local Company who came out and
leveled my yard charged me and how
unsatisfied I was mhm so that gave me a
they gave me a baseline right and then
we went from there what did they charge
it was like 900 bucks for a couple yards
of material they didn't educate they
didn't provide any instructions they're
just like yeah we're going to come out
and throw sand on it before you level a
yard you've got to scalp it because
you're leveling the ground and smoothing
it out not the grass so that was one red
flag for me of like you guys didn't even
advise me to do that how are you going
to Lev you already knew more about it

[08:01]
to Lev you already knew more about it
than they did correct and so once I had
that yard where it was at I took the
photo I put it on next door and I said
hey how much would you pay a month to
have your yard look like this and I gave
four different prices in a rough idea
range of pricing for a square footage
and you're really just doing research
I'm researching and what were those four
price ranges it was like 225 175 150 and
125 is that like $2.25 per square foot
per month no it was really more in like
how many services so like I was going to
be have to like cut that yard right in
five times so I was like okay if I got
to do 225 divided by five that's $45 a
cut well that's what okay a regular
mowing person would cut but they're just
coming out mowing blowing cutting and
leaving cutting the grass as high as
they can I'm coming out here and like
hey if your yard look like this what

[09:03]
hey if your yard look like this what
would be the price range now there's
several things that go into that there's
services that go off of that there's
coration top dressing leveling if
leveling is the end goal
fertility right fertilizer so there was
a huge thing and so that's where it
really started was understanding more
about feeding the
grass right not just cutting it not just
cutting it that's a cultural practice
and so cultural practices most people
say they don't care they just want to
cut every two weeks and whatever the
cheapest is that's not our ideal client
they don't see the same vision in their
yard as we do or the gap between what
they see and what we see is so far off
that they're they're not really
interested somebody also has to be able
to take that and say this is how you get
there and this is roughly what it costs
it's really not that hard it gets easier
to take care of my yard I literally
water it cut it and put one type of

[10:00]
water it cut it and put one type of
fertilizer down right now that's it so
it sounds like it really started like
you kind of started as a lawnmowing
company with the added feature or
benefit of having a level lawn and just
an amazing beautiful lawn as opposed to
a company that just comes in he's in and
out in 15 minutes and just cutting it
right because it seems like today you're
a lawn leveling company but when you
were doing your research you're like how
much to cut your lawn but it will look
like this and I'm going to do all these
other things to get it to look like
right well well it it started out with
called real cut landscaping and we used
the r e eel which was the mower type
that you have to cut your yard to look
like a golf course so we went into real
cut Landscaping because nobody scalps
yards right the company who leveled my
yard uses liquid ation that's not really
air rtion so there was just a couple a
lot of things but we started in
landscaping we're back in landscaping
now like we've broadened back because
we've grown to find the right people who
do the quality of work and that's what

[11:00]
do the quality of work and that's what
my whole ever since I got started it's
always been about quality and results
I've started up a lawn care company and
I shut it down we were growing so quick
as a leveling company that we
backtracked on that but we are now
pushing to become the largest lawn
leveling landscape fertility and then
maybe we'll add mowing but we really
want to become the largest company to be
able to have all services in one because
nobody really does does all of it some
people only do top dressing some
companies only do coration some
companies don't do landscaping or they
don't do Mowing and so it's like hey we
feel like most people would rather have
a on Stop Shop and we're slowly building
into that based on the people we hire
that we believe can provide exactly the
end result that we want which is what
the customer's vision is yeah okay so
back to that first nextd door post you

[12:01]
back to that first nextd door post you
post the four options what was the
response like we had like 150
something responses wow yeah it was a
lot you're you're in Austin right you're
in Austin I'm Georgetown North Austin
right so it was really locally in our
area that kind of we did the poll and it
was pretty good most people were like in
the mid-range around the 175 range 225
was a little expensive for them but it
still gave us a market that it's out
there and there's probably a lack of
information for them to understand what
all goes in that and that's our job to
close that Gap that gave me the
information and so I started just with a
couple neighbors right just doing a
couple things just you know look I'm
doing on the side very low cost right
just give me an opportunity just
learning yeah just give me an
opportunity to turn your yard around I
mean this is a great business CU you
acquire these case studies and then you
get before and after pictures and just
like a weight loss drug like before and
after sell better than anything exactly

[13:01]
after sell better than anything exactly
and so what's made that easy like we
have a really huge case study right now
with a gentleman in Liberty Hill he did
like a pool so we had to go in there and
dig that area out but he had put new saw
in last year and couldn't water it and I
says man I think we can really recover
this so we pulled a sole sample right
first what's going to put the yard in
the environment to grow that's really
where we have a chance to be successful
if we're feeding it right and we add
water and we add F fertility and then we
do a couple C practice changes we should
have no issues with getting a yard to
recover okay did those two Neighbors
come from the next door post or did
those just come from on them well just
local neighbors like the nexter
neighbors started taking over his yard
started doing the other gentleman's yard
right and then the next door post
correct that was the other source of
information at that time like
of so phase one is researching on next
door and doing your neighbor's yards
what was phase two of the business phase
two was in the business was with a

[14:00]
two was in the business was with a
neighbor a neighbor had seen my post and
wanted to really launch a company like a
true lawn leveling company and so phase
two was going after a market that was a
niche it like nobody really was doing
what we were doing now your neighbor
wanted to partner with you or he wanted
to be a customer for lawn leveling no he
did not want to partner with me he I
assisted him the partnership never was
offered on my end and so we split and
rebranded and and took off on our own
Journey from there so he's doing his own
thing right now yeah okay interesting
okay so that was phase two now you're
like are you all in on leveling at this
point yeah I I mean so after that first
year of just triing air with a lot of
things I started buying equipment up I
started equipment was really high so I
was tra traving out to Nashville to buy

[15:02]
was tra traving out to Nashville to buy
trailers uh I went to Kansas City
Missouri to buy a dingo skid steer right
so we started acquiring equipment
advertising pushing customers building a
website so we started going all in on it
and just slowly acquiring equipment and
customers all right if you are watching
this clip right now you are watching
this on YouTube and if you are a fan of
podcast please check out my podcast
while you're at it because sometimes I
have podcasts that aren't on YouTube and
sometimes I have YouTubes that aren't on
podcast so check out the ker office on
any podcast platform or you can go to
TKO pod.com also my newsletter will
throw that in there there are no ads
It's weekly it's different content than
my podcast and YouTube newsletter.
chrisj cerner.com You'll see the link
and we'll see you there was there a
template you were looking at like you
saw another guy across town that was
doing this or were you just kind of
making this up at the time a lot of the
information came from the neighbor right
that's where it was at we were still
communicating quite a bit at that time

[16:00]
communicating quite a bit at that time
it got pretty self-explanatory what all
needed to be done right and we've
adjusted our model from there and have
grown into other things as we've learned
were you able to convert that next door
post or poll into actual real customers
and if so how were you able to see the
poll respondents did you DM them what
did that look like no we just kind of I
honestly just kept it pretty even I
didn't Target them I did go use that but
I didn't go back but I did just use like
you said some of the case studies to do
that and leveraging I would find people
on the next door and I would just reach
out it's a source right people have
questions the world that we're living in
now we gravitate towards Facebook
groups or next door we're gravitating
towards social media to gain information
rather than looking it up the problem
with that is you have different ways
things can be done but not all of it may
be relevant somebody needs in San

[17:02]
be relevant somebody needs in San
Antonio Austin or even around the street
is different than what somebody needs up
north and there's not a whole lot of why
behind it like why am I putting down
this product they might see results but
when issues arise they don't know what
may have caused it because they've just
been putting stuff down or they don't
remember because somebody just said do
this so it's evolved so that's been the
source is is social media yeah so you
you started posting more in local
Facebook groups and next door was that a
pretty strong customer acquisition
channel for you once you had your
equipment and you're up and rolling no
honestly it's really not being a lawn
leveling company and the amount of
people that search it is that's just
there's only two companies yeah there's
only was it you and your neighbor yeah
me and my neighbor we're the only two
you know lawn leveling companies I've
kind of gravitated more into a Lawn
revitalization Company we offer soil
testing we teach people about soil

[18:00]
testing we teach people about soil
testing we're using organic matter in
our products because that's where water
and nutrients live like right now
there's top dressing rebates and
coration rebates if you do that the
lower Colorado River Authority in the
cities will reimburse you well there's a
reason for that because organic matter
retains more water and so they're you
know to try to stop people from using so
much water they're going to pay us a
rebate back for that and so we're
working on a deal with that to where
maybe we can get our lawn leveling mix
that we have because we came out with a
coffee grounds manure uh blend of
leveling mix that's an 8020 we're trying
to see if we can get some kind of rebate
program for that because I would rather
people use that than just straight sand
because they both still provide the same
service right you can still Level a yard
just as easy with both yeah okay so with
these rebates does that go to you or to
the homeowner to the homeowner so we'll
help them out right we'll give them the
who to email it to we'll provide the
invoice the photos right the details of

[19:01]
invoice the photos right the details of
that here's the form fill it out add
your water bill to it and then they got
to email it off and if the program has
money or they approve it or whatever so
it's up to like basically it's up to
$600 50% up to
$600 wow now I know you just said like
you're getting so much business inbound
you don't really need to go chase
customers but I think you would want to
like really put that because who knows
that about that rebate right who
actually knows about that other than you
so if you were to lead with that you
know what I'm saying right and so that's
why we're trying to like look at at
least the top dressing is for sure in
the rebate and coration but the lawn
leveling is not right and so how do we
help get that into it because people are
going to do it one way or the other
right that's just what's going to happen
they're going to level their yard either
way but why not improve the healthiness
of the
yard rather than just level it because
sand has no value other than

[20:01]
sand has no value other than
leveling have you ever thought of using
an automation to basically fill out
those rebate forms for the customers and
then direct mailing it to them all they
have to do is just sign it and mail it
100% I collect all my information into
Google forms right so like I'm pretty
data driven I'm like how do I do this
and that so all my information comes
into Google forms that's just a scaling
thing right it's just a time and a
scaling at that point yeah yeah so most
and like I said like you don't need to
right now you're doing great so what's
the point we've always been like
mid-march after spring break we've
attempted to level yards a couple times
before spring break but you get the
weather you might get one more little
cool front that comes in but really
after spring break is what we're after
that's where we really start to crank up
things and then this is probably the
slowest period of our business you've
got holidays coming up or we just went
through holidays July fourth I think a
lot of people's travel starts at the end

[21:01]
lot of people's travel starts at the end
of June and into July so they're out and
then as you get into mid July now and
August there's generally another last
push as we've gotten through most of the
heat which this year has been completely
different like we just got rain we've
got more rain coming right and so that's
been a that's been a huge pain point
this year was how do you level a yard
when you've got rain every other
day and so this one this year's been
definitely a curveball for
sure so your leads are coming inbound is
it organic Google is it paid Google ads
or just organic paid so because we are
the second company and we've rebranded
and a lot of people have jumped in the
market and they claim they do leveling
they don't really do that I I constantly
get customers to say oh yeah I paid them
to come out and do it and I'm like I'm
sorry that we are just now finding that
out yeah I know those guys and yeah
that's just been part of the game but
there are more people getting in it but

[22:00]
there are more people getting in it but
the reality of it is none of it's
sustainable just on its own lawn
leveling itself cannot
sustain it as a business only you have
to diversify the end of September you
shut down so what are you going to do
six months for income you have to have
other sources of revenue it's just the
businesses always have shown that over
the last three or four years when I got
laid off in
January I went full-time into the
business have you tested other
opportunities in the offseason like
Christmas lights or anything or if
there's someone up north and where The
Season's even shorter for them what
would you suggest that they supplement
their income with landscaping or Lawn
Care like even lawn carees even and and
both of those are still partially
seasonal but like Lawn Care can be
partnered up more right and and that's
what we're looking at doing right now we
are seeking out Partnerships and or to
buy a lawn care company okay so phase
two we talked about that what was phase
three what did it look like when you
really started getting crazy you're

[23:00]
really started getting crazy you're
doing a lot of lawn leveling you're just
printing money what does that lifestyle
look like for you and what broke during
that time period man mentality like
we've had over 600 leads come through
our website majority of those leads come
from February to may like we're getting
10 11 leads in a day and so I went to
Google Sheets and started color coding
that like I found it last year what
broke when you have so many people and
you don't know how to call them all back
because that's like I at least want to
acknowledge I got their stuff and we did
pretty good I think we we called back at
least 90 to 95% of our leads this year
there's probably about 5% we never
really got to and then there's probably
a percentage that never answered but
when you have a massive influx by March
and you're already having 35 jobs that
are on the books paid deposits ready to
go it just Stacks up from there and then
people want it done now and I tell
everybody don't like you can level all
year long don't wait till where
everybody the demand is at its peak and

[24:02]
everybody the demand is at its peak and
it's just that they're afraid of the
Heat and that's why we came out with the
820 was so we can retain more water and
still do the job that we needed to do
growth just broke everything managing
leads hiring people training new people
then we got into making our own material
mixing it ourself like nobody has a
compost around here that really doesn't
use bio sols most of all of them use
biosolids and to drive the nitrogen
that's why we switch to the coffee
grounds but they also all have mulch in
it like sticks so when you're cutting a
yard at a quarter of an inch and you got
a stick in there or rocks or something
so we that's not going to work for us
these people are using very expensive
mowers $3,000 units right cutting like
scissors you can't have sticks in your
stuff and so we've been wanting to solve
that for two years but the growth just
BR just broke everything you just
couldn't be everywhere I was running 10

[25:01]
couldn't be everywhere I was running 10
and something leads a week like my
calendar was packed eight nine leads a
day just boom I guess it's more like 50
leads like two 300 quotes just a lot of
time just running and running and
running and then it's hiring and then
logistically is it going to rain today I
need to get material there in the
morning because it might rain overnight
and then it's wet and if it's wet we
can't do it and then the yard's muddy
and so it just becomes a really really
the a logistics thing and you got guys
not showing up you're dealing with all
that I mean we have a tree trimming
company so we see all of it right the
best thing to do is manage expectations
in the beginning and I told all of them
hey we're two three weeks out plus rain
so if we get a week of rain that means
we're four weeks out and so we've always
tried to manage that
expectation we're not going to rush to
get it done and I'm not just going to
come out cuz you want it done because
it's not ready to be done our machines
can make ruts it's material we're moving
material to ground soft we need to let

[26:00]
material to ground soft we need to let
it dry out a little bit so we don't
create more problems and so it's just
really managing those expectations of
hey we're going to reach out five days
before but this is your projected date
plus
rain and so that's how we manage that
let's talk about unit economics so what
does an average job look like for you
not like the best not the smallest
average job ticket size time to complete
labor costs all that
so our average ticket price is around 22
to 2,300 bucks and that is a range of
what most of these homes around here so
it's really between the $1,800 and
$2,600 is the
average where the bigger portion of our
business lives in because they're 3 to
5,000 square feet and 3,000 to 5,000
square feet and we're using anywhere
from like seven yards of material to 15
yards of material right and so and
everything has a price to it if we got

[27:02]
everything has a price to it if we got
to scalp it which means we've got to cut
the grass down to a half an inch bag all
the grass get a dump trailer here and
haul it off that that's another driver
that's another trailer another fuel cost
right then we have the crew that's
carrying another truck and trailer of
all the equipment and they're core a
rating materials in the street we use
dingos to fill up the top dressers lay
the material out everywhere and then you
start using drag mats we've got leveling
drags we've got leveling rakes I mean we
have all kinds of different tools
because every yard has different flower
beds and different slopes and things
like that and gates are small and gates
are big so it just kind of depends on
how easy it is to get to a job the
easier jobs are the bigger yards they're
wide open you can use a drag pull behind
your mower or we use our top dresser to
pull our drag and that pulls the sand
compost mix from one end to the other
and starts filling in all those low
spots and then you got to start dealing
with valleys so we've gotten our

[28:00]
with valleys so we've gotten our
leveling down to like two or three
initially when we started it was kind of
four but we've went a little bit heavier
on material because we have a nitrogen
compost mix and so we've got it down to
where we say everybody hey at least just
consider it
twice yeah some people are happy with
one but a lot of the customers are in
New home builds because they're not
they're just throwing down sod and
they're really bad and people can't walk
in their yards cuz they've got ankle
breakers that's what we call them ankle
breakers I've got a yard full of ankle
ankle breakers yeah so 2,300 bucks for a
3 to 5,000 foot lawn on average how long
does that take you and what does your
cost look like on something like that c
the biggest cost is material and labor
right those are going to be the biggest
costs on that let's just take example
like an $1,800 job which is like 4,000
square feet right roughly right in there
so we're looking at six to eight yards
of material most of the time we have

[29:01]
of material most of the time we have
customers scalp their yard before you
get there yeah because that's a loss
leader like we'll spend an hour and a
half two hours to scalp a yard and you
really can't charge much more for that
me mean materials are already $60 a yard
right so deliveries anywhere from $125
to
$300 right then you have Labor and we
use fertilizer right we're pulling soil
test we're telling them why their yards
leading in phosphorus and what to do and
why to do it right so we're constantly
educating that on that information and
so cost-wise when you look at it with
insurance and maintenance and everything
you know on an $1,800 job your cost is
easily 12 to
$1,300 now if a $2,300 job is it a
better margin there like are there
economies of scale it gets worse as you
go up the smaller jobs are a little bit
more profitable because you're having to
use use more material for bigger yards
and the price can't just keep climbing

[30:01]
and the price can't just keep climbing
like I can't say hey six yards of
material because the jobs do get easier
when you have flower beds and tight
Gates and things to go around it's a lot
more time right so that a smaller job
can actually take us longer because you
have to use wheelbarrows or some of your
equipment can't get in there so you have
to do piles you have to hand level it
you can't really drag it because the
drags are too big for the yard hard and
so doing a bigger job is easier it's
just they take a long time too but
they're not profitable okay so call it
$4 to $800 gross profit per job
depending on the size yeah then you sell
overhead you got to cover that's it
insurance is one of the I mean Insurance
sucks yeah what is your insurance
running dude it's like $8,000 a
year and I only you and it's well it's
it it's based off of income right

[31:00]
it it's based off of income right
general liability off of the income that
we generate that's how they do it so if
my if I make more money they want more
money yeah I'm like but I didn't have
any issue I didn't file a claim and
we're commercial right so I'm a
commercial company Thomas J Henry's
breathing down my back we may not be a
semi but you know there's a lot of risk
for a little bit and it's why I don't
think a lot of companies stay in it
because it it's a lot of work it's a lot
of equip
lot of logistics and it's seasonal yeah
what percentage of your jobs turn into
something recurring maybe it's Lawn Care
something else you have any data on that
I mean the Landscaping is the biggest
reoccurring right because we come out we
assure that we want to hit the end
result and this is what we're going to
do and the recovery of yards take two to
six weeks depending on healthiness of
grass Sun rain right but then it turns
into Landscaping hey we showed up we
communicate we did a good job can you do

[32:01]
communicate we did a good job can you do
landscaping and that's why I started I
got I wasn't in landscaping for a while
because I didn't understand it I didn't
have the workers but now I use two or
three contractors they're really good at
what they do how about this I don't do
it and if you want to design or you have
an end result I'll bring in a landscape
designer that I use they're going to
design the plan and I'll bring in
contractors and I'll make sure that you
get exactly what you want and it's good
in quality you're the GC I'm the GC
because I don't I see it all the time
people aren't getting what they pay for
we see sprinkler heads that somebody
will come in and do a flower bed and
block like we expose all of the laziness
or crappy
contractors irrigation lines that aren't
buried six inches we hit them all the
time rock and material that they didn't
put underneath there sprinkler heads
that are covered up by stonework because
they didn't just turn them on Mark them
before they put in the ston work just

[33:01]
before they put in the ston work just
stupid lazy stuff stupid lazy stuff man
it's like we expose it because now your
yard is scalped and I see all the
sprinkler coverage issues and then you
see a head that's washing out because
it's covered up by a stone and their
yard's not getting watered and it's in
100 degree weather or we'll core air
rate and we find rock underneath it all
the time like we pull out rock all the
time bricks like my machine pulls out so
much material at times you know you're
paying a lot of money for a house and we
have a water issue but nobody's holding
them responsible for putting down the
right amount of material that helps us
save water so we really are creating our
own water issue alone we see that we
have to be the bare bad news that they
put all this stuff there and we have to
manage that because they think it's us
because we exposed it now after you do a
$2,300 job how much more work like let's
say they don't want to use you again or
maybe in another year how much more work

[34:00]
maybe in another year how much more work
is there for the homeowner to do moving
forward to to keep it looking good yeah
we give them instructions these are the
expectations and these are the
structions this is how you should water
this is when you need to fertilize next
and this is the timeline where you need
to start to consider cutting your yard
that's it same process after that cut
your yard often and fertilize when you
need to do it and you're off and running
so we simplify that road path of
instruction plus we use anonomous right
so one of the things that we do that not
even lawn care companies or anything
around us do is we pull soil samples my
agronomist will look at it and say this
is what it's lacking and how you need to
feed this yard to put it in the best
healthiest state to grow we give that to
the customers and tell them hey this is
how to do this how do you pay your
agronomist do is it like a purse oil
sample well he's become a really good
friend of mine actually so again this is
back to the next door deal he was on

[35:00]
back to the next door deal he was on
there his passion for grass is the same
way I have it I just want to bring the
passion I have for grass and close the
gap of information he's my source of
knowledge he's got his Master's in
Agronomy he's looking to go get his
PhD and who doesn't love drinking beer
and talking grass I do that's one thing
we have in common right you don't
realize it but it's like everybody else
around us is bored in that subject but
we're just talking about it but I just
pay him per Soul test right and because
we both have passion with getting grass
to grow he just charges me for a soil
test man he's become one of my best
friends he's been so helpful in the
success of our business and and we get
it people leave us reviews like the
knowledge and the information that we're
sharing with
people we get reviews on that because
nobody else is willing to spend the time
with the customers to do that and that's
like where we're wanting to build a
podcast and a private Facebook so we can
continue to control that information

[36:00]
continue to control that information
because there's a lot of different
opinions out there like IRAs like liquid
ation is ation that's not that doesn't
deal with compaction like core a kind of
an oxymoron kind of kind of an
oxymoron it is and I would never want to
put liquid ation down on my yard and put
material on top of it like what's going
to breathe really the oxygen because
golf courses don't rely on liquid ation
only they don't yeah and that's kind of
who you're looking for as a template for
a beautiful lawn that's it right for
sure they're the ones that do it on the
biggest level managing 18 holes and
several Acres of grass and water where
every hole may be different that's how I
grew up I grew up in Alaska working at a
golf course I went to Midland I worked
at a golf course I like Golf and I like
grass when I figured out I could have
how easy it was to have a grass that
looks like a golf course dude I was all

[37:00]
looks like a golf course dude I was all
in I was like this is awesome if you
could turn back time you keep all your
knowledge you start this business all
over again what would you change about
it from the ground up to make it more
scalable more profitable what would you
have done differently I would have
focused more on the lawn care I should
have kept going in the lawn care route
to solve that issue but I already knew
more about the leveling and I didn't
know the seasons but I I should have
kept the lawn care and I had a lawn care
company last year but I just can't take
things on if I don't feel like I can
really hold up my expectation and I
couldn't do that I had to let 45 of my
lawn care clients go and I went and
searched out the best company to
possibly hand them off to to make sure
that they were in good hands but that
was my source of reoccurring business
coration top dressing here's our rebates
here's a package deal to keep
controlling the growth of their yard and
the healthiness of it throughout the

[38:00]
the healthiness of it throughout the
whole process because you need fertility
to make it grow as well ideally we don't
want to have to live off a
fertilizer because our the
micronutrients and organisms and all
that in the grass and the organic matter
will let the yard grow itself which I've
gotten to a pretty good point where I
don't need it as much I only need
nitrogen I wish I would have stuck with
the lawn care side of things a little
bit more because that would have made it
a more
sustainable business in the longevity
even though it is still seasonal as well
but you can do a subscription base and
break that cost up easier here's a
question I like asking business owners
because I'm a business owner and I'm
always distracted like let's say for
instance we have a tree triming business
and we find I'm saying this like it's an
example this is real life we find a
really cool way to acquire customers and
it works amazingly and then I'm like a
an ADHD squirrel and it's like oh man
man we could use this lead generation
method to sell it to all Home Service

[39:01]
method to sell it to all Home Service
businesses and but it's like all right
focus focus focus I'm curious what
you're seeing T that are tangential to
your space that are that you think are
amazing opportunities that someone else
could and should Chase but that you're
too focused to to really want to chase
that's a tough question because I'll be
honest I'm chasing the material business
I bought a dump truck I own a dump truck
it's hard because there's hundreds of
landscaping companies there's hundreds
of mowing companies but there's so many
bad ones so in a way it's easier to
stand out right you're right but you can
only stand out to those who are willing
to pay for something that they really
want we're all dealing with inflation we
all deal with it it costs us money to
drive an in an insurance on top of the
same price as a homeowner's paying right
I don't even have medical insurance we
cannot afford medical insurance it's
just expensive I'm glad God's got us
covered at the end of the day it's right
you know it's like that's who I rely on
to protect us until we figure that part

[40:01]
to protect us until we figure that part
out of it I'm focusing on right now for
our business to what I see what other
companies are doing and what I want to
do what do you mean by the material
business s you see in that sand LOM
compost mixes lawn leveling mixes right
bringing out better quality materials
and like your coffee ground leveling mix
yeah so we just got like lean requires
you to use a 7525 kind of like a LOM
compost mix to put down and you're
supposed to put 6 in which is the right
way to do it underneath sod now if
they're doing that who knows but we
create one we just got some material and
we're going to mix up our own 75% loan
but use 25% of the coffee grounds and
manure mix because the coffee grounds
provides nitrogen only but the water and
nutrient retention on coffee grounds is
really good it's really comparable to
spum Pete Moss which is like the leader

[41:00]
spum Pete Moss which is like the leader
of compost and Texas A&M did a huge
study on the coffee grounds and so as
clean as it is it doesn't have rocks and
Mulch and sticks and it's a very clean
product if water's an issue why are we
not doing more at the beginning of the
process that helps the homeowners in the
long process because I went to Colleen
the other day and these people bought a
house a year and a half ago so they're
outside their warranty and they put no
material down underneath the sod I have
it on my Facebook as like a picture
where it's 4 in of rock they paid 300
something, it's going to cost them
another 6,000 to have a yard that they
should have had right in the first place
then fine if you guys are going to cut
the corners then I'm going to cut the
corners on everybody else and I'm going
to get a good quality product and I'm
going to undercut the market because you
guys shouldn't if that if you're telling
me that's how it has to be I'll sell it
to you for cheaper just to do it right
by a homeowner do right by what the
people like own your product and your
product is a house and a home for

[42:00]
product is a house and a home for
people's family and memories like own
that do you see any other opportunities
like in software like I kind of look at
this industry as like a you probably
don't look at it as new or novel but I
think most people look at it as new and
novel I compare it to epoxy flooring in
garages right it was very Niche five or
10 years ago and now there's a whole
Marketplace built up around it to where
you can pay five grand to fly to to
Pennsylvania and take a course over the
weekend on how to do a foxy flooring and
then come back home and start your own
business do you see opportunities like
that like maybe lawn leveling software
like booking software like tangential
maybe software maybe not opportunities
that are very directly tied to lawn
leveling no I won't put any more
investment into lawn leveling that I
already have what do you mean by that
it's a niche market and the reason why
we came out in the material business is
because people want to pay to do it
themselves too because there's a sense
of pride and joy in that right I mean we
all did it I won't do it anymore I know
how hard it is to do it in the Heat and

[43:01]
how hard it is to do it in the Heat and
to not have the equipment because the
first year we did it it was all
shoveling there was no dingos to speed
up the process and to do that it it's
tough work so it's not more people are
getting into the market and because it's
seasonal there's only so much that's
really worth getting involved in that I
think there's like a company tried to
start up last year and by the end of the
year they sold all their equipment I'm
into software if you seen like my Google
sheet when I do a job I collect all the
information the service the delivery
cost the labor cost the material amount
the square footage I collect all that
data and I color code everything because
I need to follow the process when you
have 600 leads how do I know if they
made it to the next level I use a a
four- tier sheet we got responses
appointments booked quoted and completed
I instantly can go in there and just
divide the numbers to get my closing
rates and what people were converting
and things like that I used to work at a
data company called Corva which is

[44:01]
data company called Corva which is
basically AI Drilling in the oil field
because I have an oil and gas background
of like 12 or 15 years sitting on a rig
hoping my yard would look like that one
day and then I'm you know pandemic hits
and it's like here's your opportunity
looking at data data tells us a lot of
information I go in there and look where
are all my jobs most of my jobs are in
Georgetown then the next amount of jobs
are in Liberty Hill in Austin and so we
know where the jobs are and most of our
work is new bills I'd say say it's
probably 85 to 90% is homes that are
within the pandemic timeline why
inflation D everybody started throwing
up homes as fast as they can doing
crappy jobs and we just got to get to
the next one we got to get to the next
one we got to get to the next one
because we had interest rates at like
2.75 or two and a half to buy home and
so there's a lot of repairs and work to
be done to all these properties over the
next several years I guess that's good
for business it it is it's good for
business business it just sucks because
you know you pay for something and you
didn't get really too much of anything

[45:01]
didn't get really too much of anything
and now everybody starts labeling it as
to s a home builder grade right which is
ankle
breakers yeah you know that's how they
refer to that as home builder grade you
know yeah I've been looking at like the
Google Trends and keywords and I feel
like in most markets lawn leveling is
still early and where you're at it's
like getting somewhat saturated it's
saturated but it's not right because
like I said we've did something jobs
this year right we did more than we ever
have we couldn't get to everybody but
there's always a repeat business a sense
of you get 10 11 clients who need a
second leveling right out of those and
then you have people who plan for it
next year and then you've got the new
people who are now starting to discover
it didn't know there was a lawn leveling
company and now a lot of what we're
starting to do is like when we say lawn
leveling people think that's the same
thing as lawn
grading and they want us to solve their
drainage issues because their home
builder built it on a flat and didn't

[46:00]
builder built it on a flat and didn't
grade it and so we get a lot of calls
that go into that and that goes into
landscaping and so I feel bad for these
people and I I have a sense of ownership
that I have people who want to work
contractors who want to work and do good
work so I just need to get them in
Partnership and say hey you know what
let me send my Landscaping crew out
there to go take a look at it and we'll
do the best job that we think we need to
do that we can do and if they're unhappy
then we'll do whatever we got to do to
make it right
because that's our job do something
right sure there's circumstances outside
of it but that's just kind of where it
has pulled me to it and that's why I use
a landscape designer somebody will say
hey what about these plant like I don't
know plants let me get somebody who's
really good with plants you give me a
Target to hit with what you want I'll
put it all together for you I'll button
it up yeah if nothing else I think that
one of the big unlocks for me in this
conversation has been using lawn
leveling as like your core competency
and your niche and your specialty but
like that's not the main thing that

[47:00]
like that's not the main thing that
might end up being 20% of your business
you're leading that into bigger five fig
six figure landscaping jobs even right
correct correct interesting that's the
path we're heading yeah well Brandon
like this has been super insightful yeah
Chris I appreciate your time yeah where
can people find you if they want to look
you up or listen to your podcast your
website will'll be Central Texas lawn
leveling CTX L is the brand that's
starting to become it which basically
Central Texas lawn leveling Central
Texas lawn and landscaping right you
know becoming that whole outdoor
solution so we have Tik toks that CTX
lawn leveling Instagram Facebook we have
all that on there and then of course our
website as always we growing and we're
just managing that as fast as we can we
try to hire people and we have to
diversify into Landscaping so hopefully
this will be the year where we'll stay
in it fulltime all year long cuz it it's
not anybody that's doing that we are
looking at creating a podcast I think

[48:01]
looking at creating a podcast I think
Saturday we're going to shoot our first
video oh that's cool and so we really
kind of what's the podcast GNA be called
yeah level up lawn podcast is what we're
thinking so because that's what we are
we're lawn leveling companies do you get
any business from Tik Tok or Instagram
or is it not localized every now and
then not really I use it to try to just
simplify what we're doing in a job and
what's going on and what all goes in
into it you know loading material and
delivering materials and scalping and
things like that Facebook is majority of
any social media it's going to be mostly
Facebook because that's where the lawn
groups are and there's one lawn group
with like 880,000 people in it wow like
just in your area or no just in
undergrass it's called Bermuda Bermuda
lawn
dominators okay huge there's 880,000
people from all over I mean it's such an
awesome Community that's just kind of
what it is there's 880,000 people
geeking out about grass people have no
idea how yeah how much opportunity there

[49:00]
idea how yeah how much opportunity there
is in Facebook groups yeah and so we
woke around in there right so there's
not really a lawn leveling company
established in San Antonio new Bron
Falls South Austin so we will cover
those areas we go to San Antonio I tell
people hey we'll go to Houston we just
need two jobs to go there because we
have to spend two and a half hours
driving there 2 and 1 half hours driving
back and a core air rate and level
material we're spending 5S hours in
labor in gas just to get to the job here
we're 30 45 minutes away but we want to
do a good job and I get it's like tile
work and painting I don't want to do
those I will pay somebody to do those
yeah yeah same so I've done tile work
and it I I was tripping all over that
bathroom I'll tell you what yeah you
know there's just some things we don't
want to do and and if you want to do it
yourself that's fine I'll provide you a
really good quality product to level
your yard with that has nutrient value
water retention value that helps make it

[50:01]
water retention value that helps make it
easier on you long term so I'll provide
you the material then okay well Brandon
this is great thank for your time man
