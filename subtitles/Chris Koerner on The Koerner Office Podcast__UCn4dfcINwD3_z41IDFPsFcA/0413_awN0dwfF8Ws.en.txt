look at this freaking guy right here why
aren't you starting this business yet
here's how you should start it why you
should start it and what it is why
should you start it because there's much
more demand than Supply in this business
the average job cost between $600 and
$1,800 and doing this costs up to 80%
less than replacing concrete altogether
you can start this business for 5 to 15
grand because all of this expensive
equipment can be rented this industry is
growing at 6% per year which doesn't
sound like a lot but most Home Service
Industries grow about 2 to 3% per year
it's called concrete leveling and or
mudjacking and just about everyone I
call to do a job for this either doesn't
answer their phone or are booked up for
weeks you've been talking about starting
a business for years why not this full
business plan right here
