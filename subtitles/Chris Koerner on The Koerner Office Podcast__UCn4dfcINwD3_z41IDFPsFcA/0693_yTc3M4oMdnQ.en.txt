[00:00]
what if I told you you could pull out your
credit card buy a bounce house like this for
1,600 bucks and make 1,600 bucks in profit
every single month or better yet buy 10 of
these for 16,000 bucks and make 16,000 bucks
every month in profit but today we dive deep on
the bounce house rental business so stick around
martina how are you chris great to meet you good
to meet you meet Martina and Adon so Castles
of Dallas yes [Music] where are we right now
we are in Sigleville seigleville suburb of Dallas
yes and what is your business um we do inflatable
rentals we also do repairs and manufacturing okay
mhm and how long have you been in business we've
been in business this business has been here
for about 10 years and then we took over four
years ago okay and Adon started the business
yes he did what made him want to start he has

[01:04]
been in this business before so he wanted to
learn more about it he also wanted to start
a business make more profit just better life
was he an employee and a competitor he was an
employee before okay and he kind of learned the
tricks of the trade yes branched out on his own
yes okay so you started with two inflatables in
your garage yes we did how much did those cost
400 each and they were used okay and where did
you buy them from marketplace on Facebook okay
10 years ago no it was 6 years ago I would
say okay mhm and how how did you find your
first customers was that on Facebook Marketplace
as well yeah Facebook Marketplace okay has that
changed today are you still funding um right
now we do have a software we use that um that
helps us out with rentals we have our website and
everything so a lot of people they just go to the

[02:01]
website they either Google us and they'll find
us on the website and also we still use Facebook
Marketplace i think it's still a great place to
get more clients um now we do promotion on Google
we do stuff like that it's just to get out there
so mostly I get calls and my website um leads do
would say we have now about over 40 inflatables
okay we have our bounce houses are bounce houses
with slides we have mini bounce houses we have
water slides we have obstacle courses and we have
interactive games okay how do you decide what to
buy i would say it's buying used units and just
see what hits more what um goes out more yeah
what do you rent out more for us I would say my
strongest unit is going to be our obstacle courses
interesting our obstacle courses are really a big

[03:05]
hit a lot of people like those because it's it's
for kids smaller bigger and adults has that always
been that way or is that a new development um
I would say it's something new i think as the
time has gone by a lot of people do a lot of
different designs a lot of creativities and and
when it comes with bigger units obstacle courses
where they can run jump and do all kinds of stuff
that's something a lot of people like more than
just a regular bounce house have you seen a a
difference in the business before and after CO
have there been changes uh actually yes during CO
there was a lot of rentals a lot because everyone
was at home so everybody would just you know take
a bounce house home so the kids can entertain so
it has gone down but I will say that I think it's
because there is a lot more competition there is
a lot more people just um starting it from scratch
and they just want to go ahead and do it and I
think that's what's really changed honestly but

[04:04]
uh the other thing that has changed is that a lot
of them are newer more modern more it's it's more
sophisticated so it's kind of like if you can't
beat them join them and in your case it's like
if you don't want as many competitors then sell to
your competitors rights or new units that way the
more competitors you have the the better you do
cuz you're selling to them what percentage of your
competitors do their own repairs or manufacturing
what percentage if any oh not that many so you've
got about 40 units in here how many of these did
you make yourself ooh that's a good question like
15 of them 15 mhm and the rest are you getting
used from the United States new from China we do
a lot of um we get them used we get We do purchase
it's always good to have variety i feel like if
you have variety different styles colors and all
you get to branch out more you get to get whatever

[05:01]
client you know comes your way are in that way
are you able to say your client calls say "Hey
I want an obstacle course we're sold out but this
water slide is awesome." Are you able to kind of
do that divert clients to other places you could
always do that with any type of inflatable i mean
if they want an obstacle course hey but you know
they're all not they're booked this weekend but
we have a bounce house with a slide yeah you know
that that's something that they could um also like
and then we would go if if anything we would try
to help them find something that we know they're
going to love mhm how much do one of these weigh
on average bounce house anywhere between I would
say 80 to 120 lbs water slides it can be 200 to
250 obstacle course is same okay are you using
dollies to move them around we do so we have
vans that we use i personally like the vans
because they're closed they're in there um they're
spacious you do get a lot of stuff to um you can

[06:04]
just put a lot of stuff in there okay and that way
you it saves you trips but we have used trailers
we have used box trucks everything is good for
that whatever it takes i had a rental about I
would say two weeks ago two or 3 weeks ago and it
was a big rental it was about three inflatables
really big inflatables and then it was I would say
maybe a hundred chairs and then 10 tables it was
a lot so what we did is I have a Tahoe we hooked
up a trailer to that we put whatever we could fit
into the trailer and then we took the van and then
we took another van wow so whatever it takes we
we take it yeah i got to ask what does a job like
that pay anywhere between 1,000 to 1,500 nice okay
for a few hours of work it's we do overnights okay
so it a few hours of of active work on your part
okay mhm take down set up we set up we take down
we do all that good stuff is anyone on site during

[07:04]
the rental or no uh it depends if they require it
and they need it we do do on-site um just staying
there watching observing and everything okay how
much extra does that cost it will cost anywhere
between 100 to 200 okay for the entire time an
hour okay per hour per hour oh nice okay so when
are you setting up stuff out here what calls for
that um our cleanings okay every every cleaning
starts from Monday throughout the week um we just
come out here set them up inspection everything
make sure nothing's ripped holes anything like
that um and then after that we just do the
you ever get business just from drive by traffic
we do we get a lot of that because um I like to
sometimes during the week I'll inflate one of the
bounce houses and leave it out there just to like
so they can Oh look there's a bounce house so
that's always that's always helped us and that's

[08:00]
why we're here we're we're here in this area and
we haven't left because it's good traffic yeah
most people don't think about that they look for
the cheapest real estate not knowing that like a
location like this could save them $2,000 a month
in Google ads yeah right cuz of the amount of
chairs honestly I really like it especially cuz
we're an open location where they can just come
in hey I need a couple tables and chairs for this
weekend all right yeah we can get them for you and
they just pick up and drop off my rental or like
he said um if you ever if they ever need a rental
a bounce house but hey I need tables and chairs we
can always do a service where it's a package deal
okay so you're just trying to fill the demand that
people are asking for right yes i I like to think
that we're one of the ones that are a one-stop
shop because we have a little bit of everything
but that comes with a trade-off right like if
you're only bounce houses you're going to have
to say no a lot but you could be more streamlined
right mhm but if you're a one-stop shop you say

[09:00]
yes more but there's more complexity to manage has
that been difficult to manage different types of
rentals or I think it has at the beginning because
you're starting off and you don't know really what
you're getting yourself into but once you start
just doing it and just start to get a little bit
more organized it's something really easy to
catch on and it it just becomes natural what
does this cost you and what do you rent it out
for they're $14 each um when you purchase them
new usually they come in a box of 10 okay so you
would have to purchase the 10 to get a full box
and then we rent them out for $1.50 okay per
day or it it depends if it's um it'll still be
$1.50 even if they choose a couple hours or next
day okay okay so you rent it out 10 times and it's
paid off mhm nice basically and the tables I have
some of these tables these are like lifetime 6ft
tables you can get them at Sam's okay and those
are like 80 bucks yeah uh right now they're 80

[10:00]
mhm good guess okay and what do those rent for um
the tables by theirelves they're $5 each and then
if you get a package deal the table and six chairs
it's $12 okay any guess on what percentage of your
rentals come with tables and chairs i would say
more than 75% wow yes that's significant yeah what
something like this sell for 1,500 1,500 okay
plus tax now I know that in China you got to pay
a lot for shipping what would something like this
cost from China and how would the quality differ
i think anywhere between 1,700 and 2,000 so even
more money then you got to wait you got to pay for
shipping shipping is the quality similar or worse
i would say it's the same we use the same material
same ounces ounces same thread and everything
interesting it'd be really easy for you to say
"Oh it's low quality it's crap over there." But
if it's the same it's the same i would say it's

[11:00]
the same because that's what they um say they
have the material the outing and everything but
um to me this is the standard this is a standard
that's how you make them yeah the difference that
we have is that we um offer warranty with our
units and we repair them here if you order them
anywhere out there you know how are you going to
send it back yeah or Yeah that's the hard part
i've been importing stuff from China for like 15
years and if you're importing shirts you could
get a box of 50 shirts and shipping would be
80 bucks right it works but something like this
if you get it in a container sure shipping isn't
that expensive but who needs a container full of
these so to order just this alone would probably
be like $400 exactly so you're saying you can
manufacture it cheaper and there's no shipping
and you'll warranty it and the warranty is all
so from what I understand you or Adam took over
this business from his employer right yes i think
that's an interesting story because there are
10,000 baby boomers retiring every day and 10%

[12:05]
of them are business owners and most people don't
realize that most businesses like this they'll
never sell they'll just close down the owners
don't know they can sell they don't know how
to sell it is there a broker most of the times
businesses like this they'll just lock the door
walk away one day and so what was that process
like taking over this business from the previous
owner well honestly the previous owner she wanted
to retire already and she was just ready to retire
but she was she was waiting to find someone that
knows this business and also likes it and will
take care of the business and keep it going so
she saw promise in Adon mhm she did okay and did
she approach him first and said "Hey what what
would you think about this or?" Well he came and
applied and he started working with her and then
yeah she she approached him and told him "You know
what i can see that you like doing this i can see
that you're a good hardworking man um I'm I want
to sell the business what do you think about it
so then you raised money from friends and family

[13:08]
and then do you have contractors in the offse that
you use for busy times i wouldn't say contractors
because this is a business that is familyowned and
family run so we do have um you know his brothers
nieces nephews that like to help us out and also
my kids okay but most of the stuff you guys are
managing yourselves you're doing deliveries you're
picking up answering the phone yes okay have there
ever been any like stressful moments particularly
stressful i think the stressful thing about this
business um mostly in the rental it would have to
be just being on time i mean the simple things are
the important things but it's the things that no
one does right answer your phone show up on time
because if there's a birthday party at 3:00 and
you're there at 3:45 Yeah it doesn't work yeah
exactly what What is like an average busy week
look like for you in the summer how many jobs

[14:02]
are you doing like how many bounce houses are
out at any given time i would say for rentals
anywhere between there anywhere it just depends if
it's a regular bounce house they start off at 100
and it just goes up there okay mhm and how are
the what are the margins like in this business
the percentage is really high for rentals it's
really high it's something that's could be all
year round you could probably make a h 100,000 a
year yeah okay anywhere from 100,000 and up okay
and if you if someone buys a $1,500 or $1,700
unit how long will that last if they maintain
it if they keep repairing it could it Oh they
can last years 7 to eight years using it every
weekend every weekend and after that it's just
not worth repairing anymore yeah they It gets to

[15:00]
the point where the material is just too worn
out that it's not worth you know repairing so
let's say you've got a $1,600 unit $400 to rent
first four rentals let's say it's rented every
weekend first month it's paid off right after that
you're making 1,600 a month topline you still have
your gas and your time that I mean that's like
18,000 a year in revenue from one $1,600 bounce
house that's pretty good it is it really is get
10 bounce houses 180,000 a year assuming you keep
them all rented assuming it's not seasonal a lot
of assumptions but then when you start adding in
tables and chairs and water slides it becomes
less seasonal the more stuff you add right yes
do you do stuff for weddings at all yes we have
tents we have tables and chairs i also have round
tables heaters when it's winter time okay that
good stuff and I also rent out ACs okay mhm for
the average operator that owns say one bounce
house how difficult would it be to them to keep

[16:03]
it rented all the time i feel like as long as
you're promoting yourself and you're out there
you know hey I got this bounce house i'm ready to
rent out and just make yourself known make your
page uh social media right now is a big play in
all this to be honest make videos take pictures
i take pictures every time I set up even though
I've have probably a million pictures of the same
one but it it's just you know putting out there
your stuff every weekend what you rent it out
that will give you more clientele that will help
you out to make a lot of money even just to your
personal social media page yeah even Yeah okay so
Facebook Marketplace posting to social media even
if it's not your business page just talking to
friends and family most people aren't going to
have a retail location right they're just doing
out of their house mhm you kind of have to have
a trailer of some sort right you can't really
car and a truck a van would work though right

[17:01]
like a minivan even if you put the chairs down
yes okay mhm so that's a really good side hustle
today you you probably wouldn't advise me to only
buy one right cuz once if you run out one then
you can't do anything or when when clients come
and ask me look I'm looking to start off what do
you recommend i always tell them to get a bounce
house with a slide okay our bounce houses with
slides are detachable everything is detachable you
can detach the pool the bumper like if you use it
dry there's a bumper where they just hit and um
that's detachable the slide is detachable so you
could rent it out by itself with a slide or with a
pool okay so would you say that's like the most in
demand item yes your bounce house with a slide
is that a water slide or It's both either and
wet okay if I were if I wanted two bounce houses
should I get two of the same two of those or like
something different plus I would get something
different just to have variety i've always

[18:05]
recommended um either get a bounce house and a
water slide or a bounce house with a slide and
a water slide okay mhm now if you were starting
this all over again 10 years ago what would you
he recommends to buy a new unit when you start
off buy new units tempting to buy used I'm sure
yes it is but you don't know how long they're
going to last you you don't know what condition
they're in like it's better off to start with a
new one and let it last you years with warranty
cleaning it taking good care of it than to start
off with a used one and then having to buy more
later on okay is insurance a big expense it is but
at the end of the day it's something you have to
have especially here in Texas what do you pay for
insurance per month um I would say we pay anywhere
between seven to 10,000 a year a year okay a year
i think insurance it it it scares a lot of people

[19:07]
i think insurance and liability is a big reason
that people never start anything and frankly I
think a lot of times they use it as an excuse to
not have to start something i post ideas all the
time and everyone says "What about insurance what
about insurance?" You buy it you buy insurance you
have to um I think it's something that it's
a hassle it's sometimes a headache but it's
something you have to have and it brings you it
it opens more doors to you because if you have an
event that they need last minute a bounce house
and you're ready to go you have your insurance
you have your resist everything's ready to go and
you can just go and set up if you don't have your
insurance and it's in a venue where they need
insurance they need this they need that and you
don't have it you just lost money right there yeah
