if I could take all my business
knowledge and go back to age 21 today
here's exactly how I would make 10 to 20
grand per month in profit I would start
by renting a nice house with a nice pool
from a nice landlord and rent out the
pool for parties on peer space and
swimley you can charge $2 to $400 per
hour for pool parties if you have a big
nice pool because 8 to 12 people can
share the cost it stays 70% booked on
the weekends 40% booked on the weekdays
and then in the mornings you rent out
the pool to swim instructor so they can
teach lessons you need the insurance for
it you need permission for it but you
don't need to buy a house you don't need
to come out of pocket people are doing
this today
