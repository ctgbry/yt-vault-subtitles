[00:00]
the investors want to do a deal it's the
deal of a lifetime and they want to
invest a lot of money but they need a
lot of equity and there's not a lot of
equity left for us and so this sucks
it's wrong I know but you're out you're
out of the company we are going to close
this down we're going to form a new
entity instead of you having 33% you're
going to have
[Music]
3.3% there's something that really
bothers me about business content that I
want to get ahead of today and that's
the fact that business Partnerships are
hard and that they usually fail and it
is an extreme trial of life to go
through a broken Business Partnership
that fails nobody really talks about it
they're ashamed of it they're
embarrassed about it they don't want to
tell the other side of the story or
their side of the story but I want to
dispel that today today I want to tell
you about the hardest Business
Partnership experience I've ever been
through and frankly this is one of the
hardest things that I've ever been
through that I want to talk about that I
think you want to hear about but no one
else wants to talk about so let's get
started so I tweeted this story over a

[01:01]
started so I tweeted this story over a
year ago it was 1,700 Words which is a
really long tweet and 1.3 million people
liked the tweet and they shared it and
they commented and hundreds of people
dm' me and said this happened to me this
happened to me but no one's really
talking about it so I know there's a
demand so I want to tell you this story
of what happened to me and tell you what
I learned from it and at the end of this
video I want to tell you the other side
of the story all right Jason's side of
the story because you're only hearing my
side of the story but I'm a firm beli
believer that every story whether it's
divorce or partnership breakup there's
always another side there's always
another argument we don't usually hear
that side okay so I'm going to tell you
Jason's side of the argument against me
that he told me himself in my truck that
day once we finally talked openly about
this so let's get going
so about five years ago my wife made a
friend here in our local area and she
was awesome and they were talking one
day and they said what does your husband
do oh he's a Serial entrepreneur what
does your husband do oh he's a Serial

[02:00]
does your husband do oh he's a Serial
entrepreneur what else does he do oh
real estate what about yours Oh Real
Estate wow we should get them together
so they did they got us together and I'm
going to call him Jason which is not his
real name so Jason and I had lunch one
day and I had just sold my business I
had some free time on my hands and he
was just scaling up his business so he
owned hundreds of single family homes
around Texas and he had wanted to start
buying mobile home and RV parks because
he had more investor Capital than he
knew what to do with and it was not very
efficient to buy small single family
homes with investor capital cap whereas
spending millions of dollars on an RV or
mobile home park is much more efficient
but he needed help with operations and
with marketing and so we had lunch one
day and we just hit it off right off the
bat like two pie in a pot and he said
okay let's do this let's start buying um
mobile home on RV parks I'll raise all
the money you help find the parks and
operate the parks and I'll show you
everything I know I'll tell you
everything I've ever done and ever
learned with mobile home in RV parks
because he had been to a seminar he knew
a lot about real estate I owned a few
rental homes but he knew way more than I

[03:01]
rental homes but he knew way more than I
did so we hit it off we rented a an
office and we started going into the
office and cold calling mobile home and
RV park owners so early on he said hey I
have this friend named Omar I'm changing
his name as well Omar knows commercial
real estate really really well he's a
good friend we've been in business
together for a long time I think Omar
should be a part of this I think we
should be equal thirds Partners I think
he can add a lot of operational
expertise and so I thought you know
let's meet him so we met Omar and he
seemed nice enough and then we said
let's just see how this goes let's kind
of trial run this three-way partnership
and see how it goes so it was very
apparent from the get-go that Omar was
not doing anything he was very busy in
his other commercial real estate
business and coincidentally our offices
were in the same hallway on the same
floor of the same building but we rarely
saw him at all and he wouldn't really do
much and he came with three or four
other partners as well they were kind of
Silent partners and he was the one
interfacing with us but he wasn't really
interfacing with us and so first month
or two goes by and we're getting things
under cont contract we were looking at

[04:00]
under cont contract we were looking at
single family homes and mobile home in
RV parks and then I'll never forget one
day we had breakfast at Starbucks Jason
and I right down the road and I had a
very Frank conversation with him and I
said Jason Omar isn't really doing much
and we haven't really made this official
we haven't in an operating agreement yet
so like are you sure you want Omar as
part of this and he was Jason was very
upfront and he apologized on behalf of
Omar and he's like you're right he's not
and I'm angry about it but I don't know
what to do I really think he'll pull
through he's kind of in a busy season
right now so let's just make this work
so I said okay you know I mean I was the
guy that was brought in I wasn't the one
initiating all this and so I probably
should have been more bold in retrospect
and said I'm not doing this if Omar's in
this because he's already proven to not
be adding any value now we each put in
the same amount of money Omar did put in
the same amount of money as Jason and I
but he wasn't doing anything
operationally whereas Jason and I were
working on this fulltime more than
fulltime we're going into the office we
were driving around looking at parks
getting things under contract getting

[05:00]
getting things under contract getting
rejected he was raising money I was
hiring and managing people and we had a
real business going on also real quick
before I continue this story I really
want to know do you want to hear more
Business Partnership failure stories
like this because I know so many people
that have had them and I'd like to make
it more of a recurring segment on this
podcast to interview people that had
them and I kind of want to edit myself
out asking the questions just so it's
them telling their story I think there's
a lot to learn from people like that so
if you think there's a demand for that
if you might find that interesting
please just email me Chrisco
founders.com or comment below to tell me
if you think that I should talk to
people like that and so we signed an
operating agreement we were equal thirds
partners and we were Off to the Races
and so Jason did what he said he would
do and that was raise a lot of money and
he did we bought a park in Oklahoma then
we bought another Park in Oklahoma we
bought a park in Texas we bought a park
in Kansas we ended up buying 15 16
something 15 to 20 Parks over the course
of 18 months and this entire time Omar
was is not doing anything um and Jason

[06:01]
was is not doing anything um and Jason
was upset about it and he would talk to
me very openly about it dude I'm sorry
you were right we had that conversation
you were right he's not doing anything
what do we do I don't know I don't know
what we do and I'll never forget I'm
skipping a little bit but early on when
we first discussed this operating
agreement me Jason Omar and then Omar's
other partner got in this room at Omar's
office and we were talking about how do
we keep track of our time or the value
that we're adding and Jason and I came
up with this idea which is annoying but
effective that we should track our hours
and we'll distribute the profits of the
business based on how many hours we put
into the business and Omar and his
partner did not like this idea at all
really because they weren't doing
anything and if they tracked their hours
it would not look good and they wouldn't
make many distributions and that was a
huge red flag in the moment and looking
back that they didn't want to basically
put their money where their mouth was
and they said I remember they said value
ad isn't about the hours you put into it
it's about the experience that you have
and it's like okay yeah I can see that
but you're literally not doing anything

[07:01]
but you're literally not doing anything
like you're the contribution that you're
adding is you got the operating
agreement signed you filed the LLC in
the state where we bought a park that's
it and so this entire 18 months Omar
wasn't doing anything but it was kind of
tricky because I didn't want to openly
complain about Omar because Jason and
Omar went way back they owned a bunch of
real estate in a different entity
together they went to the gym together
their families went on vacation together
and I was a brand new guy Jason and I
had just met at that lunch meeting at
the outset of all this and so I didn't
feel bold enough to really press on Omar
because Omar was a closer friend to him
than I was now over time Jason and I
became pretty dang good friends too we
went to launch together every single day
our offices were side by side we drove
all over um the southeast looking at
parks together negotiating deals our
families went on vacation together twice
just like he went on vacations with
Omar's family our oldest Sons had the
same birthday they were in the same
class they were best friends we lived
three minutes down the road from each

[08:00]
three minutes down the road from each
other we were pretty close too but we
didn't go as far back as he and Omar and
so these 18 months go by things start
heating up we're at break even now we're
buying parks with investors our rent
collections are 80 $90,000 a month so
we're at a million dollar run rate just
on rent Collections and we had just
started making enough to where we're
able to pay all our overhead and maybe
start making a distribution The Way We
Were structuring deals with investors
was a little different and so it didn't
we didn't really have any fees there
were no acquisition fees or Property
Management fees we were just splitting
the equity in the Parks 50/50 and
splitting the net operating income 50/50
and the investors were putting in 100%
of the capital and so we're buying all
these Parks we had a bunch more Parks
under contract and we started getting
some attention from big-time investors
and so these guys from California flew
out and they wanted to invest $50
million which keep in mind we were
raising like 500,000 at a time so this
is a 100 times more money than we had
been raising from one group and we

[09:02]
been raising from one group and we
hadn't really talked Equity terms yet we
didn't know how much Equity they wanted
we we assumed it would be a lot more
than we were comfortable with but we
were nevertheless willing to entertain
them and so Jason being the primary
Capital Riser he was the one interfacing
with these guys the most they flew to
Texas they met with me Jason and Omar we
met all day couple days straight Jason
took them around to see a couple mobile
home parks we met in a boardroom we they
asked us a bunch of hard questions we
showed all our numbers we had everything
ready to go and they really liked what
they saw and then they left on a
Saturday so Friday night we all went out
to dinner together one of our key
investors these two guys from California
me Jason and Omar we went to this nice
steak house and we were laughing and
everything was looking good and it
looked like they were going to give us a
term sheet and that we were going to
have $50 million to go off to the races
with to buy to really really scale a
sophisticated team an acquisition team a
hiring team a management team in-house
Property Management just start buying
these mobile home in RV parks cuz we
were performing we were buying a great

[10:01]
were performing we were buying a great
cap rates we were raising rents we were
turning them around we were renovating
the parks Jason had a ton of expertise
that he was teaching me and he was
raising the capital I was hiring the
team managing the team finding the parks
implementing some tech systems to where
we could mass text these Park owners
mass email them so I was kind of on the
Acquisitions operations management side
and he was on the fundraising side and
he just had the expertise right whereas
I had single family expertise so this
entire partnership
I was thrilled by how much work Jason
was doing and I was just trying to keep
up with him and that's a great business
partner to have he went hard he worked a
lot and I was always just trying to keep
up with them and we were also distracted
a lot both of us like we were we would
launch these other side projects and the
real estate space and see how they went
because we're both very you know ADHD
serial entrepreneurs we're idea guys but
nevertheless the main thing was always
this mobile home NRV Park Acquisitions
company and so we had this meeting with
the investors and before they got here

[11:01]
the investors and before they got here
Jason and I had this sit down and we
were like all right like it's time for
the rubber to meet the road we got to do
something about Omar because it's about
to get ugly everything's going to come
to light if they invest this money so we
got to decide what we're going to do we
didn't really decide anything specific
but we had these hard conversations and
then Jason was like I'm going to go talk
to him so he went and talked to Omar and
they had conversations about you you got
to do more I need you to do more and so
it's pretty frustrating to me because
the investors came into town we sat down
and Omar presented himself as if he was
in the weeds this whole time as if he
had this commercial real estate
experience and he knew what he was doing
and he was like the gray hair in the
room so to speak and he was going to be
the operator and I felt that was
misrepresentative honestly because he
hadn't been doing anything and on paper
yeah he looked great he had a lot of
commercial real estate experience but in
practice he had been doing nothing okay
so it felt like to me now that big money
was coming in Omar was like okay now
that this is like a real thing now I'm
going to get in involved and he was

[12:00]
going to get in involved and he was
playing politician shaking hands and
saying all the right things and I felt
very uncomfortable about that and I
don't sell myself very well I I can't
I'm not a good actor I don't fake things
very well if I go to dinner parties I'm
not I just I don't I hate being fake and
I hate it when people are fake and so I
definitely spoke the least of the three
in that weekend when the investors were
here all right if you are watching this
clip right now you are watching this on
YouTube and if you are a fan of podcast

cerner.com You'll see the link and we'll
see you there and so we went to dinner
and then the next day Jason was going to
show them a couple parks and go golfing
with them and kind of like talk terms
and then they were going to fly back to
California and so Jason and I were in
contact for the 18 months straight right

[13:01]
contact for the 18 months straight right
slack text phone iners like you name it
we were always always in contact with
each other and over this weekend which
is like the most critical weekend of our
partnership he just went completely
silent I didn't know how it went how did
golfing go do we have a term sheet are
they going to send a term sheet what are
the terms how much Equity do they want
what does this look like and it was
Memorial Day weekend I can't remember if
it was Memorial Memorial Day or Labor
day but it was um early September
it was early September so whatever day
that is it's a long weekend so I get to
the office on Monday which was a
memorial day or Labor Day and no one was
there and which wasn't really surprising
and I hadn't heard from Jason at all or
Omar and I'm like hm okay so then
Tuesday no one was there I'm like okay
this is weird and I had texted him once
or twice and he may have responded to
that maybe not but he was being very
standoffish whereas like this is a time
when we're supposed to be talking a lot
what did they say what is the deal what
what are we doing moving forward and

[14:01]
what are we doing moving forward and
then Wednesday it was September it's
either September 9th or September
11th and I get to the office again and
he's not there and I'm like okay man
it's been like five days since we're
supposed to know what's going on I'm at
this point I'm I'm kind of worried but
I'm not expecting the worst I'm just
concerned so he text me around 8:30 that
morning and he says meet me at the
Starbucks across the street I'm like my
heart just sank I'm like
okay what
what why like why can't you meet me in
the office your office is on the other
side of that drywall the conference room
is on the other side of that drywall
that's where we meet that's where we
talk why are we meeting at a Starbucks
across the street so I thought okay
maybe it's time for rubber to meet the
road we're going to talk hard decisions
with Omar maybe they gave us a term
sheet and you know Omar's office was
literally down the hall from us so I
assumed he was afraid that Omar would
walk in when we were talking about him
so we wanted to meet across the street
it's like like those like when I'm a kid

[15:01]
it's like like those like when I'm a kid
say you're eight years old your kids go
out to the movies or sorry your parents
go out to the movies and they don't come
home for a while they're late and you
start thinking the worst maybe they died
in a car accident that's what I would do
anyway maybe that's not normal like but
you know that's not normal in the moment
right you're like that's unreasonable
I'm being and you know what they come
home everything's fine in the very very
very very very back of my head I'm
thinking maybe they're pushing me out
but no they wouldn't push me out because
like I was the one doing everything with
Jason that's the guy not doing anything
for the last 18 months that's the guy
that he's going to want to push out so
he was like way in the back of my head
so I drive to Starbucks and on the way
there I'm nervous and I'm thinking if
Omar is there I'm screwed we're done
this is over I'm going to know exactly
what's going on if Omar's there if
Omar's not there then we're probably
going to talk about Omar so I get to
Starbucks CA corner of Campbell and 75
in Richardson Texas and I pull up and
Jason and Omar are sitting outside

[16:00]
Jason and Omar are sitting outside
looking Stern serious and I can just
feel the tension and theyve got Omar has
sunglasses on and he's just has his arms
folded just kind of looking staring and
I sit down and it's like so awkward like
not a word has been said but you can
just you just know I'm like What's Up
and Jason uh is very very to the point
he's very direct and he's just like I
don't remember exactly what he said so
don't quote me but he's like the
investors want to do a deal it's the
deal of a lifetime and they want to
invest a lot of money but they need a
lot of equity and there's not a lot of
equity left for us and so this sucks
it's wrong I know but you're out you're
out of the company we are going to close
this down we're going to form a new
entity instead of you having 33% you're
going to have 3.3% instead of you having
an operational role you'll have no
operational role and you are going to
have to sign a non-compete to where you
can't buy any more mobile home rview
parks outside of this and we don't need
your help anymore I know it's wrong it
sucks I'm sorry but this is what we're
doing like it or not that's what he said

[17:03]
doing like it or not that's what he said
and Omar was not saying a word he was
just staring off in the corner and so I
said okay well what's Omar getting and I
point to him and he's like oh I don't
even know yet this is too early and I'm
like guys come on seriously you think
I'm stupid and that's my biggest pet
peeve is if people assume that I'm
stupid and who doesn't hate that right
it's like you think I really don't know
what's going on here of course you know
what Omar's getting of course you guys
have been talking weekend of course this
has been planned like and so I was just
fuming and I didn't know what to say I
don't remember what else was said but I
just I remember sliding my chair back
and it was the metal Starbucks chair
against the concrete patio and he was
like and there were people out there and
I just stood up and walk it away just
shaking just my hands were just shaking
and I got him my Tundra and I called
Nick my best friend first thing I did
and I told him what happened and he was
incredulous cuz he had been I mean we're

[18:01]
incredulous cuz he had been I mean we're
best friends and he had been he had a
front row seat to this entire situation
for the last 18 months he knew exactly
what was going on he was incredulous he
could not believe it and so I drove
across the street to our office our
employees were there they were on calls
didn't say a word to them I got all my
stuff I put it in a box and I drove
straight home and I walked in and my
wife met me right at the garage door and
she had this look on her face like what
are you doing what what are you doing
home and I told her I said Jason push me
out push me out and she could not
believe it right it's like you have this
perfect happy marriage and then one day
your wife has a second family right or
your husband has a second family with
kids and you had a perfect marriage like
what there were no problems where did
this what where did this come from you
know usually there are signs you can see
this coming she was floored and so I
just kind of brushed by her I went in my
room turned on the fan turned off the
light closed the door and I just started
balling period business is freaking hard

[19:03]
balling period business is freaking hard
it is chewing glass and staring into the
abyss as Elon Musk said it was hard I
just bought I just felt so betrayed I
wasn't thinking about the money or the
equity or the opportunity I just felt so
betrayed this was a guy that I had lunch
with every single day for 18 months I
went on vacation with him this is a guy
that had been complaining about Omar to
me for 18 months what just happened how
did this happen Omar wasn't even a good
operator he wasn't he' proven himself to
not be a good business partner and
that's the one he chose what is going on
here what did I miss I was in a dark
place the next thing I did was I went to
our guest bedroom with my MacBook and I
opened our Dropbox and I saved all of
our folders to my personal computer all
of our data all of the mobile home park
data the owner contact info everything I
didn't know what was going to happen I
wanted to know that I had all of our
data so I saved all that and then I
called the lawyer and I kicked things
into gear and it got ugly and it got

[20:03]
into gear and it got ugly and it got
nasty and we got lawyers on the phone
and we ended up like the deal ended up
dying the deal with those investors the
50 million that died and Jason told me
it was because that their du due
diligence was too thorough and he was
just getting really annoyed by how many
documents they needed to send yada yada
yada but I don't think so I don't think
that was the real story I think that
they got wind of what was happening
between this partnership and it looked
like a really messy situation to invest
$50 million into that's my guess I don't
know so that deal blew up and then Jason
stopped going to the office all together
we had employees there we had people
managing Parks we we were collecting
rents and but I was the operator and
instead of like filling in my shoes he
just stopped going to the office and so
we had all these parks that stopped
getting collected I'm not going to
collect on these Parks right I just got
shoved out and so these Parks started
performing poorly immediately and it all
just fell apart and so we ended up

[21:00]
just fell apart and so we ended up
retaining a a a broker and selling off
the parks bit by bit paying off
investors and it we just kind of wound
it down we wound it down entirely and
then Jason and Omar they had a third
business deal so they had our deal then
they had a real estate deal with some
single family homes and then they had a
healthc care deal that completely blew
up they ended up suing each other and
they got kind of at each other's necks
they fell apart and then Jason ended up
barring against his single family home
portfolio to buy crypto that crashed in
the 2021 crashed so he lost most of his
single family homes kind of had to start
from scratch so all of Jason's investors
not all of them many of Jason's
investors lost money his previous
investors from the single family homes
lost their homes and a bunch of money
and then Omar's original business was
doing fine but their Healthcare deal
fell apart and they sued each other and
it was kind of every man for himself and
then I just started writing about mobile
home on r parks on the internet that's
what I did I stopped buying them myself

[22:02]
what I did I stopped buying them myself
I was never the fundraiser and so we
everything fell apart there was not like
a big chunk of money that changed hands
like I sued them but then it all kind of
fell apart and there was really nothing
much left to collect so it all just kind
of died and some of the parks we sold at
a profit most of them at a loss it just
got really ugly and it all happened
because of one stupid conversation at a
Starbucks that really never had to
happen and so Jason and I talked about
this afterwards and I'll never forget
this conversation and I was like dude
what happened like what were you
thinking and he said a couple things
first of all he said that was wrong that
was wrong and Jason is an impulsive
person he's probably the most impulsive
person I've ever met and I could tell
you a dozen different stories about him
being impulsive but but I won't out of
respect for him but he's very impulsive
he makes big decisions very quickly
knee-jerk reactions and so that's what
he did here he was impulsive and he was

[23:00]
he did here he was impulsive and he was
greedy he wanted more Equity I don't
know what the deal was I don't know how
much Equity that these investors wanted
but now to the other side of the story
right what's his side of the story if he
were sitting here next to me and I would
like to interview him on this podcast
one day because we are acquaintances he
still lives nearby me his son is still
close friends with my son I see him
around at school activities and I have
no ill will against him I'm just not
going to go into business with him again
and so I would love to talk to him on
this podcast if 'd ever be willing but
what's his side of the story so he was
um angry or upset that we were trying to
buy all these Parks we had more Parks
under contract than we can fund than we
could fund at some point and I was not
trying to raise money and I wasn't at
all and he thought that he was doing
everything he could he was opening his
Rolodex to every friend and family
member he'd ever met and he was calling
a lot of people I heard him I could hear
them on the other side of the door
calling friends family members doctors
lawyers people he'd worked with in the
past trying to raise money for these
parks that we got under contract I was

[24:01]
parks that we got under contract I was
not okay that's his side of the story
was that he was pulling out all the
stops I was not and so I deserve less
Equity now as to why he chose Omar I
don't know I don't know about that but
my argument to why I wasn't raising
money was because that wasn't the deal I
didn't have money to raise okay when I
bought my first home I used student
loans for the 3.5% down payment when I
bought my second home I used Obama's
$8,000 Tax Credit Plus student loans
plus a couple Grand in savings from
waiting tables when I bought my third
home that was like savings from my
iPhone repair business I I didn't have
access to Capital at the time at all not
from my parents not from family members
I had no way to raise money and that was
never the deal anyway from day one the
deal was Jason raises money I work on M
marketing and operations if he would
have told me on day one I'm going to
need your help in raising money I would
have told him I can't help with that
right like I can cold calls I can do
that but I don't have a network he

[25:01]
that but I don't have a network he
already had this big Network that he had
raised tens of millions of dollars from
to buy single family homes he had a
network ready to go I did not and so
that was never the deal that's my
argument to his counterargument that's
how it ended but he ended up saying I
was wrong I apologize I shouldn't have
done that and he's not in real estate
anymore I think he still owns a few
rental homes but he's doing something
completely differently and we've we've
kept in touch somewhat but not a lot and
that's what happened so my learnings my
takeaway from all this don't get into
bed with someone right when you meet
them don't marry someone right after
meeting them that was dumb that was
stupid of me that's what I regret I
regret just signing an operating
agreement with someone that I didn't
really know the history of but at the
same time if I could go back in time I
don't know if I would have changed it
because I started writing about this
experience on the internet I started
gaining Twitter followers talking about
mo mobile home and RV Park investing
never having a plan like I I didn't have
this Grand Vision where I'm going to

[26:00]
this Grand Vision where I'm going to
raise a fund to start doing this all
over again I just knew that there was
strip mall guy and hotel guy and
restaurant guy and Self Storage guy and
I was a consumer of all this real estate
content and I thought hm there's no
mobile home park guy I can be that guy
also start writing about being that guy
so I did I played that role and I
enjoyed it and I grew followers just
like strip mall guy did but I never
really had this Grandmaster plan of
using that following to raise this fund
okay until two years later I got
approached by a fund that already had an
established track record that were
buying mobile home in RV parks and they
said hey we like your audience we like
your experience you speak the language
you're able to Source off-market Parks
through your audience you're able to
raise money for off-market Parks through
your audience how about we try something
let's try a deal together and so we did
we shook on it we did one deal together
in Louisiana and it went really well and
now I'm a cgp on that fund and we're
buying one to two parks a month and I'm
helping Source them I just sourced a
park for them in Montana that's going to
complement our other Montana Park I'm

[27:00]
complement our other Montana Park I'm
helping Market the parks I'm helping
write investor updates because I love
writing and I'm helping raise money for
these parks and that's providing an
income for my family and it's helping me
build my net worth and so that 2year
experience and it was really two years
when it was all said and done it was a
very expensive education in real estate
but all of those learnings I was able to
leverage into what I'm doing today and
I'm grateful for that experience I'm
more hardened I'm more self-aware and
trials it's the Refiner's Fire trials
put us through the Refiner's Fire and we
become better men and women because of
these trials and I wouldn't be where I
am today because of them so I wouldn't
have changed the thing but if you're
listening to this and you've had a
partnership nightmare like mine forgive
right when you don't forgive people you
are punished more than that other other
person right not forgiving people is
taking a poison pill and expecting the
other person to die that's not my quote
something I heard but I love it you will

[28:00]
something I heard but I love it you will
be sick to your stomach you will be
angry all the time unless you forgive
how do you forgive I don't know I don't
know appeal to a higher power meet with
the person face to face hear their side
of the story strive to have empathy for
them and why they made their decision
because people do make these decisions
for reasons for specific reasons but you
have to forgive or you'll drive yourself
crazy at the end of the day business
Partnerships are as hard if not harder
than marriages and they're very hard to
end they're hard to wind down depending
on how big the business is it is hard to
wind down a business you have to fire
employees you have to sell assets you've
got lawyers involved it is tough so know
who you are going into business with
period end of story I've had other
Business Partnership horror stories and
I've had some amazing beautiful stories
that I could and will tell in the future
but know who you're going into business
with have a solid operating agreement
have a an unbiased third party look over
it have an unbiased thirdparty media
throughout the whole term of your
partnership that you can both appeal to

[29:02]
partnership that you can both appeal to
to help resolve disputes but I promise
you having a business partner is worth
it so I definitely advise for that thank
you for listening
