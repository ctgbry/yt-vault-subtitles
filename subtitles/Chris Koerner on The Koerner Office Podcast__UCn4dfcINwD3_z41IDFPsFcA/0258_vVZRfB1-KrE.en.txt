would you believe that this simple video
helped make this Motorcycle Company
millions of dollars you'll never believe
what simple tactic this video uses that
you can use to help you make millions of
dollars what would you say this
motorcycle has to do with companies like
McDonald's method soap glossier Lush
Tony's chocolate lonely or apple it's
packaging it all comes down to packaging
if you don't have a unique product or
service then you can at least have
unique packaging well what if you don't
sell a product how do you package a
service in your offer you got to have a
unique offer for instance if you have a
pressure washing business you can say
hey I will pressure wash your sidewalk
for free if you let me pressure wash
your house that's packaging a unique
offer Domino's made hundreds of millions
of dollars from packaging their offer as
if this pizza gets to you in over 30
minutes it's free your packaging has to
be unique
