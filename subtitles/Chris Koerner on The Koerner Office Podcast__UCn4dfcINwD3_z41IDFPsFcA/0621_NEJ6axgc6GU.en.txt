I'm not exaggerating when I say this 30
second clip could change your life how
many lottery tickets would you buy if
they were free how often would you play
the lottery buy as many tickets as I
could fit in my car why wouldn't you
that's like short form video it's a
5-minute investment that could turn into
a whole business so that was me and
here's the thing I'm an introvert the
thought of short form video made me
cringe until I turned off that switch in
my brain and reminded myself that people
don't care about me look at how many
views I've generated via short form
video over the last 13 months over half
a billion people and this is only made
possible with tools that make editing
easy like Opus clip you see with most
apps you have to have editing skills but
Opus allows you to repurpose with just a
couple clicks so any ugly video you take
on your webcam or iPhone instead of
having to learn a thousand different
editing skills you just repurpose on
Opus gone are the days of hiring
expensive editors let Opus do the
editing for you it's powered by AI check
