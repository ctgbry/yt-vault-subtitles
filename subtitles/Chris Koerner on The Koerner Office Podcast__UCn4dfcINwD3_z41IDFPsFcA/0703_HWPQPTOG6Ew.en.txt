guys I'm no conspiracy theorist but I just found
67 businesses making between 50,000 and 500,000
per month and they're all white labeling the
same $300 software but here's what's freaking
insane i just spent the last 3 hours reverse
engineering all their marketing channels their
funnels their ad copy i used some AI agents i
used some common sense and I'm about to open
the kimono and show all of this to you i want
to show you how to copy any of these business
models with tools that are literally free we're
talking Meta Ads Library Wayback Machine and
three other tools that I promise you've never
heard of one of these companies went from 0 to
1.8 million in 11 months and another one is
charging $500 per month for something that
cost them almost nothing to deliver we're
talking about six figures a month using
software that you don't even have to build you
want to see how they're doing it let's dive in
so don't ask me why but the other day I found
myself scrolling this awards ceremony page in
the middle of the night i'm on my second can
of Dr pepper Zero my wife's asleep and I'm just

[01:00]
hunting looking for patterns and what I saw
almost made me jump out of bed let me share
my screen real quick so my first thought is cool
another software awards page that has nothing to
do with me but then I start looking at what it
takes to win a diamond gold or platinum award
using High Level you have to have either 100
500 or 1,000 sub accounts aka SAS customers
software as a service customers and these
aren't 8 to 12 a month Chrome extensions
these are $100 to $2,000 a month services that
are all delivered with someone else's software
someone else's code because I don't even know
how to code and you probably don't either okay
so then I take this URL right here and I go to
Claude which is like Chat GBT except better in
my opinion and look at the prompt I gave it look
at some of these company names and find me some
that reach seven figures in a year or less and
Claude goes to the URL it scans and scrapes all
the company names and it just starts digging all
right Claude just crashed on me so I updated the
prompt made it a little more detailed and hit
search again i told it to go scrape the internet

[02:01]
looking for articles LinkedIn or Reddit post all
right while we let the AI cook let's go ahead to
this website and just start googling around real
quick and see what some of these companies do now
remember most of these companies are charging at
a bare minimum $100 a month some of them charging
three or $4,000 a month so back of the napkin math
says okay the diamond award winners have at least
a,000 customers might have 10,000 for all we know
let's say they have a,000 exactly and they charge
the bare minimum $100 a month that's $100,000 a
month without even knowing how to write code let's
just start seeing what some of these guys do and
what their websites look like agent CRM insurance
agent CRM that's customer relationship management
software let's see what they charge $97 a month
and they have over a,000 customers hubspot is the
biggest CRM salesforce these are 30,50 billion
dollar companies but with High Level you can use
their CRM white label it and resell it with your
own branding and everything so some guy just
went out and did that for insurance agents it's

[03:00]
positioning and framing cuz if you're an insurance
agent are you more likely to go buy HubSpot which
is a CRM for everyone and their dog or are you
more likely to use the CRM that is only built
for insurance agents so there's one idea instead
of insurance agent say real estate agent lawyer
veterinarian dentist orthodontist podiatrist CRM
for insert whatever profession you feel all right
let's see what Push Press Grow is gym management
software it's a good looking website but this is
literally just highlevel white labelled you could
use something like useoutscraper.com you could
scrape every gym in the country and just start
doing cold outreach to them get them on the phone
see what their pain points are all right let's
see what the AI brought us 7figure Docs which is
one of the businesses on this awards page they
serve over 3,000 medical clinics let's see how
much they charge all right let's ask Chad GBT what
7igure Docs charges for their service because it's
not publicly available on their website okay
I couldn't find any pricing yada yada try this
prompt dig deeper reddit X Facebook etc boom 1,500
a month 3,000 medical clinics 1,500 a month that's

[04:07]
$4.5 million per month now they've been around
since 2017 but sure yes I would wait eight years
to make $4.5 million a month especially when I'm
outsourcing all the heavy lifting to high level
dear doc 4,500 doctor's offices served jim
Lead Machine one of America's 5,000 fastest
growing companies so Claude is telling us an AI
focus a healthcare focus rapid scaling through
partnerships i saw another one of these guys that
just partnered with a franchiseor and immediately
tapped into a,000 customers paying $1,000 a
month these guys are all white labeling the same
software and selling it as their own they took
existing technology they slapped their brand on
it and they said "Buy this." In this case the
marketing is the harder part but I'm about to
help you with that these companies aren't geniuses
the owners aren't geniuses you just have to borrow
some inspiration and you got to start grinding
now let's get into the tools that these guys are
using to succeed and the tools that we can use to
reverse engineer them even more specifically all

[05:05]
right here's what I call the reverse engineering
toolkit and all of these tools I'm about to show
you are 100% free all right the first tool I'm
going to show you is called the meta ads library
as in the Facebook ads library you've got to learn
this you need to spend hours in here just fishing
around looking for ideas because there is more
inspiration on this page right here than almost
anywhere on the internet you know all those guys
you see on Twitter Facebook Instagram that are
flashing their Rolexes and flexing most of them
only got there because they found winning Facebook
ad combos that just worked but everything they're
doing is right there on the meta ads library for
you to see and reverse engineer you can search
by exact company by industry by geography and
if you look at the Facebook ads library in the UK
you can even see how much money is being spent on
those ads because of disclosure laws that exist
in Europe that don't exist over here in the US
let me just show you how to use this real quick
we're going to go all ads we're going to search
for marketing very broad now this shows us all
the ads that are currently running today that

[06:05]
have anything to do with marketing maybe it's
a marketing agency maybe it's a videographer
doesn't matter but the key is in the filters we
don't want to see ads that just went live today
yesterday last week or last month we want to see
ads that have been running for months because it's
very common to kill an ad after just a couple
days because they aren't performing in Facebook
the name of the game is creatives refreshing
creatives so if you see an ad that has been up
for months then it is a banger ad and you should
copy everything about that ad and change as little
as possible so here's how we're going to filter
this thing we're just going to set the two date
to about let's say 4 months ago we'll say March
1st right now it's late July all right all of
these marketing ads have been running for months
but let's filter it out even more let's get a
little more greedy let's go to January 1st 2025 so
another thing you can look for are companies that

[07:01]
have multiple ads running and have had multiple
ads running for a long time because that's an
indication of scale that means their ad strategy
is really crushing so now what you could do you
could screenshot all of these ads you could take
them over to Manis Chat GPT operator or any other
AI agent which is basically an AI tool that goes
one step further for you and does the digging for
you screenshot them give it the screenshots and
say "Find me all of these businesses that run on
a high level because then you're going to have
a much easier time reverse engineering exactly
what they're doing not just their pricing not just
the design of their website but their offer that
is the key the key to scaling a big business is
having a killer offer an offer that people feel
stupid saying no to now we're going to look at my
second favorite tool the Wayback Machine all right
let's see how long Agent CRM has been around how
long did it take them to get a,000 customers and
what did their website look like when they first
launched because that's going to save us x number

[08:00]
of years of heartache and trial and error okay
here we go marketing software built especially
for insurance agent and financial planners only
$47 per month so I like what I see they've since
doubled their pricing and they've simplified
their language in their headline which is critical
that's a mouthful marketing software built
especially for insurance agents and financial
planners and then this is what their landing page
shows today the AI powered CRM built for insurance
agents and if AI didn't exist it would probably
just say CRM for insurance agents i can see that
they're still offering a 14-day free trial which
means that that is part of their killer offer
they've never changed that and I can see that
their website has gotten a lot prettier it used
to be pretty cluttered and ugly but look at this
this form right here this is classic highle this
is the highle form let's go to tool number three
similar web you do have to create an account on
similar web but it doesn't cost anything so I'm
going to go ahead and check agentcrm.com and I
want to see how much traffic they're getting and
where the traffic is coming from that's also the

[09:04]
key they are getting 12 to 16,000 visitors per
week 12 to 16,000 per week for a $100 a month
offer is insane let's see how fast they're growing
let's say very conservatively okay 15,000 visitors
per week equals 60,000 per month you take 3% of
that and you've got 1,800 free trials per month
but these are very likely highly motivated high
intent visitors to this website 1,800 trials a
month let's say only only 20% of them convert to
paid that's 360 new paid customers every month
times 100 is $36,000 of MR monthly recurring
revenue every month could be more could be less
I don't know but tools like Similar Web get us
pretty close 82% of their traffic is coming from
the United States 72% of it is direct which is the
highest intent of traffic they didn't just stumble
upon this website they went there purposefully 1
and a.5% is paid which means they're probably not

[10:05]
running very many paid ads which is also very
interesting 19% organic which is encouraging
because it's hard to get organic traffic so that's
going to be harder to copy and 6% at referral
traffic so this tells me that whoever owns this
business is doing a ton of outbound call text
email voice agents ringless voicemail drops and
they're willfully pulling people to their website
which I actually love that that's how I've had
the most success in my business cuz I am way
too impatient to wait for SEO to work and I'm way
too cheap to pour thousands of dollars a day into
Facebook or Google ads all right let's go to my
fourth tool BuiltWith builtwith has a free Chrome
extension where it will show you what any website
you're looking at is built with wordpress Shopify
is there a Stripe pixel is there any Stripe code
on the website so you can see if they accept
payments or not do they have a Facebook pixel
which would probably indicate they're running
Facebook ads it will tell you all of these
things now BuiltWith is very expensive for

[11:04]
free you can see with the Chrome extension what
any website is built with is running on but for
$450 a month you can scrape millions of websites
to a spreadsheet to your computer and get contact
info for all of them but there's a cheaper and a
better way builtwith does not want me to be saying
this obviously they're not sponsoring this but go
to upwork.com and post a job looking for someone
that already has a $450 BuiltWith account likely
a marketing agency or something post a $20 job
saying "Hey can you just run an export on your
bill with account for me?" It doesn't cost them
anything if they're already paying the monthly
fee so it's like "Hey for 30 seconds of work just
click export on this scrape of Shopify stores or
highle websites or whatever it is i'll send you
20 bucks or 50 bucks then you can save 95% on your
built-in agent CRM right here clickfunnels highle
a lot of people see Clickfunnels and Highle as
competitors but they often work hand in hand but

[12:03]
if I had to choose one or the other it's high
level any day of the week google Analytics not
surprising facebook Pixel Twitter Authorized.net
which means they're accepting payments paypal
YouTube Snapchat LinkedIn X GoDaddy Amazon pretty
standard stuff but tool number five now this one
is my favorite linkedin Sales Navigator now yes
LinkedIn Sales Navigator can be expensive but
they do offer a 30-day free trial what you want to
do is put in your credit card sign up for the free
trial cancel it immediately so you don't forget
you'll still have access for 30 days this tool is
amazing because you can see what customers these
high-level businesses have no you're not going to
be stalking people but you can see what industries
they're serving what size companies they're
serving and what their messaging is to all these
different segments but if we go back to where we
started here this award ceremony page the thing
about these guys is they're not special they're

[13:00]
not geniuses they didn't go to Harvard they just
took a brilliant piece of software that took years
and years and many many millions of dollars to
build they slapped their logo on it and we're
talking High Lee cost 97 bucks a month there's
a free trial it's 300 a month if you want to use
their white labeling service with some AI features
but if you want to have unlimited sub accounts
which means unlimited white labelled customers
it's $500 a month but you don't have to commit
to that until you have enough customers that
are paying you at least $500 a month you could
work your way up all right let's get to the brass
tax how exactly do you do this to build your own
business you're going to start by going here this
link is in the show notes and you want to use this
link A because it's my affiliate link and I'll get
a kickback and it's a great way of saying thanks b
because you get a 30-day free trial of High Level
instead of a 14-day free trial anywhere else will
offer you 14 days my link will offer you 30 days
it gives you twice as much time to test all these
things so you'll see the link below you're going
to start an extended free trial choose the white
label account use an AI generated logo pick some
colors and boom you've got software that looks

[14:03]
like it costs thousands of dollars a month but
really it's free for the next 30 days step two
pick your niche based on data before you even do
this step you'll probably have already done some
level of research but the real research happens
in this 30 days cuz the clock's ticking until
that free trial turns paid dental practices real
estate agents fitness coaches e-commerce brands
coaches pick one pick one that A you have some
level of passion in and B you have some level of
experience in ideally both or you could scrape the
entire awards page send it over to Chad GPT and
say which one of these industries has the least
amount of competition and start there step three
copy their proven ad angles their pricing their
offer the structure of their website everything
do not try to reinvent the wheel good artist copy
great artist steal these guys have already tested
these things over years why would you try to do it
better step four the onboarding system copy this
as well you got to get this part right the welcome
emails the setup calls and the training materials

[15:02]
get this right you can use AI to generate it and
it's all there in the wayback machine now that you
know where to look see anyone can white label
this software but the real magic is in copying
their positioning the messaging the client success
systems all right let me be brutally honest for a
second this isn't your passive income make money
while you sleep bull crap this is going to be work
of everything I'm known for I'm not known for
preaching passive income this is active income
but it's predictable and reliable income you're
going to have to learn sales you're going to have
to learn marketing you're going to have to deal
with difficult clients things will go wrong things
will break but in any business things will break
and I like my problems in this business much more
than most other businesses I've started which is
almost 80 at this point but as difficult as this
is you can do this i promise if this idiot can do
this you can do this i use High Level every single
day i love HighLevel pick one company from this
awards list spend a week learning everything you
can about them and then start putting out feelers
talk to potential customers get them on the phone
do the hard thing not the easy thing of just
researching until you're glue in the face analysis

[16:04]
paralysis to the gills get these customers on
the phone use my affiliate link get to work
and have fun oh and share this with a friend while
you're at it thanks for hanging out on the Kerner
