what are the holy Grails of businesses
agency businesses and SAS businesses but
they have their drawbacks agency
businesses are easy to launch their High
ticket you can charge $1 to $5,000 per
month and they spit off cash SAS
businesses have amazing exit multiples
you can sell them for 5 to 50 times
annual recurring revenues but there's a
fundamental problem with both of those
businesses expertise if you want to
launch a pay-per-click agency you have
to really know pay-per-click inside it
out if you want to charge 2500 bucks a
month if you want to launch a SAS a
software as a service business you have
to be a developer or pay a developer and
wait a long time to get product Market
fit and then to acquire customers maybe
at $10 a month $50 a month and then hit
scale but every now and then I come
across a tool that makes me feel like
we've jumped 10 years forward in the
future when I do find tools like that I
generally set aside an entire night to
stay up and go down all the rabbit holes
and then usually by about 11:30 I sadly
discover oh okay so this really doesn't
do everything that I thought it did
let's go to bed but every now and then
maybe once every couple years I don't go

[01:00]
maybe once every couple years I don't go
to sleep because it does even more than
I thought it might and my brain is just
buzzing with opportunities and ideas and
businesses and I found that business in
high level I can't understand why no one
is talking about high level some people
refer to it as go high level that's the
domain name but it's called high level
and I'll be honest in the first couple
years I'm like oh this is another
clickfunnels yeah it's about time
clickfunnels a worthy competitor looks
like these guys are going to do it and
then they caught up to clickfunnels
which is a billion dollar company and
then they surpassed them and then it was
like oh these guys are going after
zapier now oh and they're going after
HubSpot as a CRM then maybe MailChimp as
well because they do email marketing oh
wow they're going after twio publicly
traded company because they have SMS
automation Google Voice lead Pages pipe
Drive cenly trust pilot podo and this
honestly blows my mind because almost
always when a company tries to be
everything to everyone they're nothing
to no one but yada yada yada I'm not
here to brag on High level I'm here to
show you hundreds of ideas of businesses
that you can launch on top of high level
where you can white label all the hard
stuff to high level and you smile and

[02:00]
stuff to high level and you smile and
interface as the business owner and
charge 200 a month 2,000 a month
whatever you want so this video will
plant some ideas in your head and it
will give you ideas on how to find more
ideas of your own listen to me really
quickly there are hundreds of businesses
making seven figures and even eight
figures a year and they're solely just
built on High level that's it you got a
pretty landing page sometimes you have
paid ads sometimes you have a Creator
behind it maybe it's text message
marketing maybe it's a reservation
reminder app for restaurants Maybe it's
a reputation management app for plumbers
maybe it's a CRM for lawyers there are
thousands of possibilities let's say
there's a thousand Industries and a 100
ways you can serve them that's a 100,000
different business models you can build
on top of high level for a $500 a month
agency account you can have unlimited
sub agency accounts with close to zero
marginal cost increase but I'm getting
ahead of myself as I always do so let's
back up by the end of this video you're
going to know five things one what is
high level two two what is white

[03:00]
high level two two what is white
labeling three a lot of ideas of what
services to White Label four I'm going
to provide a repository of ideas of how
you can find your own white label
service ideas literally over 10,000
different ideas and number five I'm
going to show you how to implement these
ideas so you can start your own SAS
business or agency and charge $1 to
$55,000 a month and Outsource all the
work to a piece of software that you pay
a couple hundred bucks a month for so
let's get started
just in the last week alone I've talked
to three entrepreneurs that are doing
the most obvious easy simple things on
the surface but are cleaning up with it
number one this guy charges $1,500 for a
new website design for dentists all he's
doing is clicking a button in high level
to create that for him and then
inputting his name and his logo and
swapping out some of the copy $1,500 one
time and then $200 a month for
management his cost on that $200 a month
is basically nothing because it all
rolls up to his Master agency highle

[04:01]
rolls up to his Master agency highle
account two reputation management which
is a very simple way of saying
automatically responding to Google
reviews on Google business profile
that's it you get a review whether it's
1 2 3 4 or five star and high level
using open ai's API will automatically
respond to the review it's one of like
800 highle features that's included in
their price and people are charging 100
bucks a month for it three Google
business profile review solicitation
that's it once a job is completed or a
quote is completed or an invoice goes
out or whatever box you check a text and
an email goes out soliciting the
business owner to leave a five-star
review but first it's very sneaky the
first question asks is are you happy
with your service today if no then it
says please tell us why and it will
never ask them to leave a review that's
done within high level if the answer is
yes then it leads them to the Google
business profile review page where they
can leave a five-star review but it only
sends them there if they know that they
love the service freaking br

[05:00]
love the service freaking br
there's hundreds more examples like this
but you got to find the customers right
where do the customers live Facebook
local groups Facebook Marketplace Google
payperclick Google LSA local service ads
Thumbtack Angie's List now I say
Thumbtack and Angie's List and you think
well how can I find customers there
that's a place for them to get more
customers no no no no no let's say your
customers are roofers you're going to go
to Angie's List and search for roofers
in your area and it's going to list out
all of the roofing business owners that
are paying thousands of dollars a month
to Angie list for more leads but you can
get them more leads for less and they
won't compete with anyone for those
leads you want to fish where the fish
already are as then you want to find
business owners that are already willing
to spend thousands of dollars a month to
get more leads they're right there
listed on LSA thumb Tech and Angie's
List you don't just want to cold scrape
a bunch of roofing business owners
because most of them are they don't have
this in their budget but we'll get into
more of that later I'm going to share my
screen and go to this website right here
so every year high level has an awards
ceremony called the SAS preneur Awards
and they present Awards to people that

[06:00]
and they present Awards to people that
aren't highle customers but people that
build their business on top of high
level and they list out publicly for the
world to see who their biggest agency
partners are and roughly how much money
they're making so that's cool yeah it's
cool to try to reverse engineer other
business owners but that's not what
we're after here we want to generate
ideas of things that we can copy in
their Niche or in any Niche or in our
Niche it doesn't matter so I'm just
going to take one of these at random and
pick it and then we're going to look it
up so to be in the gold tier you have to
be a highlevel agency that has
100 or more sub accounts which means 100
or more customers paying you hundreds or
thousands of dollars a month most likely
let's look up Digi woof beautiful it's
beautiful helping RPL dog trainers shine
in the real world and online I have no
idea what an r+ dog trainer is it's
marketing software for dog trainers and
the average person goes to this website
and they're like oh wow geez these Digi
woof guys they're smart they built out a
whole marketing Suite just for dog
trainers how much time and money did
that take no no no no no they're just
labeling high level that's it these guys

[07:01]
labeling high level that's it these guys
in order to win this award have to have
over a 100 customers let's say they have
200 let's say their customers pay $500 a
month which I bet you is very very
conservative $500 a month times2 200
customers is $100,000 a month $1.2
million a year and I know what their
software margins are because anyone can
see what high levels pricing is
minuscule single- digit percent what are
their labor costs this is probably a
sales guy and a Founder I would bet that
this company has over 50% net margins
which means they're making at least
500,00 000 a year in net profit and
they're probably using Facebook or
pay-per-click ads to drive targeted
traffic to this landing page and then
closing dog trainers over the phone
freaking dog trainers this is the first
one I copy pasted no prep on this video
but let's go to the diamond level award
winners these are people that have over
1,000 customers AKA 1,000 sub agency
accounts on High level I'm going to pick
one at random I promise no audience
plant no prep work you know me I'm a
procrastinator so let's go to REI reply
cuz I know REI usually means real estate

[08:00]
cuz I know REI usually means real estate
investing and I'm in that world so let's
check it out all right marketing
platform for Real Estate Investors ready
to close more deals using real
artificial intelligence okay first of
all I've been a real estate investor for
15 years do you know how many marketing
platforms there are for real estate
owners or investors thousands this is
one of thousands and they have over
1,000 customers and let's scroll down
and see what their pricing is shall we
let's see here $99 a month $99 a month
times a th000 customers at least ,000
$100,000 a month 1.2 million a year
maybe they have 3,000 customers for all
we know I have no idea and it is all
built on High level all right let's go
back to their page and look up one more
okay here we go get Spanish speaking
patience this has got to be good all
right okay this literally helps
chiropractors find Spanish speaking
patients oh my gosh only chiropractors
only Spanish speaking patients and these
guys are in the gold level which means
they have at least 100 customers and

[09:00]
they have at least 100 customers and
their pricing isn't listed on their
website which probably means it costs a
lot so is high level a good CRM
reputation management text message
automation tool absolutely but we're
here to make money we're here to build
businesses preferably SAS Andor agency
businesses so I put the link to this
Awards page in the comments and I also
put a link to my highle landing page in
