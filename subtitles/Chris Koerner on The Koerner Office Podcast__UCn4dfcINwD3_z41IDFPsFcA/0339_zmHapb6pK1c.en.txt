the mobile roller skating business is a
business I never thought I'd find
interesting I didn't know it existed I
don't like roller skating but it sounded
interesting so I knew I had to tackle it
Henry launched this business during the
co pandemic and he had no idea if this
was just a fad was this a Tik Tok thing
was this going to go away but then he
did 120 Grand in his first 3 months at
30 to 40% margins and his margins have
only gotten better from there he sets up
mobile roller rings inside malls on top
of mall parking lots or anywhere they
have a van full of roller skates that
they charged 5 grand for we went deep we
talked numbers we talked launch strategy
we talked user generated content
marketing and PR how to sell into malls
how much cost to get started and how he
achieves 70% net margins you're going to
love it please like And subscribe share
with your friends we'll see you next
[Music]
time okay so why don't you start by just
telling us who you are and what business
you own yeah so my name is Henry O'Brien
from Ireland originally which which I'm
sure the accent will will come through
I've been living as I mentioned I I I
lived in the US for

[01:00]
lived in the US for
couple years straight out of college or
university and then moved back to to
Ireland for a year thinking I was ready
to settle down and a good friend still a
good friend at the time he proposed
moving to Canada so moved to Canada
about seven eight years ago and
currently living just north of Toronto I
recently actually just moved outside of
the city to a smaller town called
Collingwood but yeah the business that
we we own and operate is called suso
skateco I'm sure we'll get into it the
name suso being short for summer Sal
this and we are
a popup roller rink and the newest
addition to the or I guess newest part
of the business is our our kind of
mobile event friendly uh roaming roller
skate van but uh yeah looking forward to
chatting chatting more about it okay so
you've been in in Toronto area for seven
eight years correct when did you launch
the business so the business started
early on um 2001 if my memory serves me
correctly uh during covid lockdown you
said 200 one sorry

[02:01]
said 200 one sorry
2021 2021 yeah sorry over year Canada
was locked down for like two years yeah
yeah yeah yeah it's it's it's a bit of a
blur now at this stage my girlfriend at
the time now my fiance we we met pretty
much as as kind of Co and lockdown all
started I was looking for a date night
activity like truth to be told we don't
come from a roller skating background I
mean I I rollerbladed like like many
kids growing up but yeah like I I was
looking for a date night activity
something fun and something new that we
both haven't hadn't done before at the
time a lot of indoor activities like
most of the world were were was shut
down so options were limited at the same
kind of parallel time roller skating was
just going through a massive surge on
Tik Tok maybe that's because it could be
done Outdoors maybe because just the the
Aesthetics of it the Nostalgia of it the
Americana of it but people were flocking
to Tik Tok um posting videos and
hashtags like roller skating hashtags
were in the billions where does everyone
go roller skating if I'm of the age and

[03:01]
go roller skating if I'm of the age and
I see a viral Tik Tok like that looks
fun like sure I could Google it but
there's no roller skating rink that just
top of M yeah and that's that's exactly
it like we we again we we kind of
stumbled into it we saw that so at the
time like like I said we were looking
for I was looking for a DAT night
activity and then quickly realized that
there was no roller skating rental
companies in an outdoor environment uh
as I said indoor spots were closed at
the time and I quickly thought like
there's such an like want and a desire
and demand for experiential activities
not only across North America but
certainly in Toronto at the time tght to
myself like what what a great idea would
be to offer roller skate rentals in an
outdoor environment under the the the
heat of the sun which is where the the
name kind of suo comes from so fast
forward a couple months and we we got
our hands in some inventory which was
difficult at the time because there was
a worldwide shortage of roller skates
can I yeah can I ask it just a couple
questions what time of year was this CU
obviously it's very seasonal where you
are if you're going to do an outdoor
business I think we probably acquired

[04:01]
business I think we probably acquired
skates in the new year of 2021 and then
we were up and running by May of that
year okay so you had the idea end of
2021 yeah I wish I could give you an
exact date or or month but it was
definitely towards the end of
2020 and it probably into 2021 and then
yeah lockdown started and then yeah just
just with the with the popularity of of
roller skating online on Tik Tok there
was no availability of of rentals in an
outdoor environment there was a kind of
a perfect storm of a few different
aspects um we approached the the city of
Toronto and there's a a spot an outdoor
it's it's they host ice skating in the
winter time it's it's a perfectly smooth
figure eight it's actually over an
expressway so it's covered come rain or
shine we approached them and said hey we
we'd love to like we know that you guys
do or offer ice skating in the winter
time we'd love to use that same
infrastructure that you have but would
do uh roller skating in the in the

[05:00]
do uh roller skating in the in the
spring summertime and they loved the
idea so to to our to our surprise and to
our they said yeah um so we rented a 20
foot shipping container for that first
summer I think we we grossed about 120k
in give or take three or four
months whoa yeah it was it was again
because there was so many things closed
down at the time really the only way
people could connect and get together be
it at a distance was was Outdoors so we
got we were very very Lucky in the sense
that we got some early local media in in
Toronto so they they shouted about us
and again the nostalgic Factor about it
it's easy to understand and appreciate
did you go looking for media we did um
yeah we we definitely reach out to a few
kind of very local media outlets and how
like logistically so I did a small stint
in a in a in a PR Company during my
intern for maybe three or four months
during University so the idea of like
the value of PR I I I've always

[06:00]
the value of PR I I I've always
appreciated so there's a there's a few
local Publications blog to to being
short for Toronto um being one of the
more prominent Publications and outlets
and just scouring whether it's their
website their list of editors their
their Twitter like DMS and cold emails
exactly yeah cold emails DMS and again
people are pretty receptive and and to
this day like if we if we open up a new
popup in a new city or town the media
especially local media more difficult to
get National let's say CNBC or or like
bigger media Outlets but when you say
hey we're bringing a popup roller rink
into town for the most part people are
like wow like this is is it's it's cool
it's family friendly it's easy to
understand it's easy to to appreciate
and and just get get rolling so we've
been blessed with a really good response
overall from a lot of media and even
even influencers looking to say hey I'd
love to go roller skate with with my
family or my friends can you book us in
and we'll we'll shoot real and some

[07:00]
and we'll we'll shoot real and some
content so we try and a lot of marketing
efforts uh we try and go win-win versus
like paid opportunities if possible okay
this is amazing I think most people
don't realize how eager editors are to
write about stuff right like they just
want cool stuff like and I think people
think oh they're getting hit up all the
time by people it's like H there aren't
a lot of people doing cool stuff they're
kind of not yeah that's why you see so
many dumb articles about you know the
squirrel that got trapped in the tree
cuz no one's emailing them about their
mobile roller skating rink business well
especially no I totally agree and
especially what we've learned and what
I've definitely learned is if you can
localize it as much as possible like
let's say a journalist in in Toronto if
you say hey I'm I'm launching a a new
roller skap business in in Texas you
know they're going to be less interested
but if you could say hey we're opening
for three months we are familyfriendly
kidfriendly and we're opening in
downtown Toronto that journalist all of
a sudden there's a bit of a hook in in
the it's applicable to me it's in my in

[08:00]
the it's applicable to me it's in my in
my hometown I write about experiences in
Toronto so that's two ticks uh straight
away um and then yeah I think if you can
finesse a good email keep it concise
keep it short there's like we we noticed
too that like direct correlation to if
an article goes live instant jump in
bookings like yeah that that for summer
we were sold out more weekends than not
we only operated Wednesday through
Sunday because we were juggling our
full-time jobs but uh yeah we were
nearly at capacity more times than not
can you speak a little more about that
first venue and why they were so willing
to work with you and like like just set
the scene for us like what did it look
like in terms of like the the location
in which we set up it's it's an
interesting and unique scenario or case
study if you will so it's city property
so the city of Toronto owned this
property it's underneath the The
Gardener Expressway however it is
operated by a non for-profit that non
for-profit is in place to really ensure

[09:00]
for-profit is in place to really ensure
that there is programming going on
throughout the year that it is it's
really kind of used the the the location
and the venue is used to its full
potential so you'll have brand
activations throughout the year you'll
have ice skating in the wintertime you
might have Easter egg hunts come Easter
so they really in place to enhance the
the community and to ensure that there's
an kind of consistent and fun and
appealing programming throughout the
year so when we went to and said hey
like you already have the infrastructure
in place you rent ice skates from this
20 foot shipping container you have a
perfectly smooth figure eight Trail they
like even as things as small as they had
the the Cubbies or the shelvings in the
container that was just like it was
TurnKey for us so as soon as we got
inventory as soon as we got protective
gear and we figured out a Wix website at
the time and we figured out okay we need
to plug in to allow bookings online we
were off to the race what's the name of

[10:00]
were off to the race what's the name of
this place so I could look it up B bent
bent W
Y super unique yeah it's um it's it's
improved over the years and we've had
different point of contacts and like
very easy to work with good to work with
if there was a location like this in
every city I I mean I think it would be
not only great for the the local
ecosystem and the the community itself
but it's uh it made
our entry into the market super
straightforward it's since become a
little bit more tricky finding similar
type of setups or even working now that
we work with malls which which we'll get
into I'm sure it's a little bit more
cumbersome but this has made navigating
working with a city a lot easier okay so
if I'm looking at the bentway I see like
a bunch of apartment on one side of the
freeway are you on the North side or the
South side of the freeway we are right
underneath that freeway so yeah you'll
see like a Greenery and park side on the
North side on the South Side you have a
bunch of Apartments a little bit further
south than that you have you have the
the water in the lake so we are directly

[11:00]
the water in the lake so we are directly
baseball field exactly yeah we are
directly underneath that freeway so even
if it did rain you you're pretty much
for for the most part 80% covered by by
the the expressway itself interesting so
you're like right in amongst all these
apartments yeah yeah right downtown like
you couldn't get more downtown like if
you were to walk I'm going to
say 15 to 20 minutes east and a little
bit north of the bentway you would be in
like the what we what what's called Bay
Street so to give you like a a US
equivalent it would be like the the Wall
Street of of Toronto so super Central
for for people flocking to the city for
for for a weekend activity it was like
oh yeah we we'll go roller skating and
then we'll go for a meal or we'll go for
a meal and then go roller skating and
like I've touched on like it it really
appeals to people young and old the
older demographic said oh I used to do
this when I was your age or when I was
20 or 30 years old and then you have the
youngsters and the kids coming through
now who are seeing roller skating and

[12:00]
now who are seeing roller skating and
actively participating in roller skating
for the first time so this is like a a
net new activity for them and now as
we've kind of transitioned into a kind
of more of a fully fledged business a
big Focus for us is like how can we get
kids off their devices how can we give
them that 45 minutes to an hour to have
fun with friends to go skating with
their parents and just get away from
screens I just love everything about
this business like sometimes you come
across business ideas is where it's like
the market is just begging for it and
they're craving it and like the bentway
is willing to do it it's in the perfect
location like it's blowing up on Tik Tok
like this is product Market fit I always
like to describe product Market fit as
this like normally you launch a business
and it's like pushing a boulder uphill
and that's not a bad thing you you push
it uphill comes down a little bit push
it uphill it comes down a little bit and
it's a grind and that doesn't mean you
should quit that's usually how it goes
but you know 10% of the time that
Boulder is chasing you and you can't

[13:01]
Boulder is chasing you and you can't
even sleep cuz you have so many
customers beating down your door is that
kind of what it felt like that's that's
exactly it and like to your point about
like it working maybe I think you said
10% of the time like after this first
season we we sold all of our inventory
the last day we
sold every single pair of skates that
we' bought let's say six months prior
we' sold through all of our inventory
thinking it was kind of like a a summer
passion project it was a a oneand done
and then with just pure like feedback
from the community demand like hey like
we we want to see you next year we want
to see you in other locations we quickly
realized hey we we could be on to
something here so we had to buy all of
our inventory again we made some tweaks
we got better protective gear and that's
when we were like okay like this this
could be this could be something like we
got to try and get back to the bentway
again next season which which we did and
we just wrapped up in end of September
with our fourth season and we've since
gone into working working with malls

[14:00]
gone into working working with malls
okay all right so I have like a lot of
questions before we get to malls but I
can't wait to talk about malls I'm just
all over the place here so what did the
unit economics look like with the
bentway how did you approach them like
how do you pay them is it I'm curious
about that yeah so we
had a pretty
straightforward let's say negotiation at
the time as I said they had the
infrastructure in place they had the
perfectly smooth outdoor figure8 Trail
they had the shipping container I think
that if I remember correctly like we
paid them 4,000 a month in in kind of
Base rent okay that has since hasn't
changed all that much depending on
location people might say hey if you hit
a certain threshold there might be a
certain Kickback so if you do good we do
good we're all for that you know if we
if we find a new location but the but
the bent way at the time it was like
yeah a flat base rent you guys are going
to be up and running for let's say June
1st uh you're going to run until really
the weather gets a little bit chillier
here here in Toronto which which is
typically the end of September so we

[15:01]
typically the end of September so we
yeah four grand flat per month we would
make that back jeez on a any any busy
Saturday uh at the time we operated
Wednesday through Sunday juggling
full-time jobs we we worked we worked at
ourselves we manded ourselves myself and
my now fiance so it meant that we were
running from our apartment uh which was
luckily only 10 minutes away um and we
were opening up and we we' we'd operate
Wednesday Thursday Friday um 4: to 9:
p.m. and then give or take all day
Saturday Sunday and then we kept and our
goal at the time too was we'd rather
have fewer sessions per week but those
sessions to be busier than open seven
days a week eight hours a day and have
two people at one in one session and and
five people in another so it meant that
people's options were limited but it
meant it meant that there was a a little
bit more of a a better experience the
whole point of this is that it's cool
and it's only cool if it stays cool and
it only stays cool if a bunch of people
are always there at the same time you

[16:01]
are always there at the same time you
don't want to be you know one of four
people like you might think people will
think oh this is awesome there's there's
so much space well no this is a party
they want a party they want to feel like
they're in on the secret is that kind of
what you tapped into 100% it was just it
was lucky timing it was people looking
to be look looking to be active Outdoors
the again it was blowing up on Tik Tok
there was shortages there was articles
in Vogue and in every like household me
media outlet that you can think of at
the time they had written an article
about roller skating and you know roller
skating as a as as an industry I would
say or as a as a Pastime hasn't really
been modernized all too much I mean if
you look at roller rinks throughout the
US for the most part the majority of
them are still your your mom and pop
with that like really outdated carpet
they're they they they may or may not be
taking bookings online but um yeah just
with with the the appetite fight for
experiences in Toronto it worked out

[17:01]
experiences in Toronto it worked out
well did you notice like a huge
multiplier effect when people started
showing up and posting about it because
this is something you have to post you
have to post about to Instagram and so
I'm picturing like the first week the
first day or whatever like it's busy
because you're new but then it's just
like man we're really busy yeah we we
have we didn't get into pay doing like
paid ads up until maybe I'm going to say
18 months ago and we've been doing it
now this is our fourth season so we were
100% reliant on user generated content
and like so much so that people would
come put on skates take a few selfies
pictures videos Tik toks and they'd take
the skates off they wouldn't even go
skating so I mean for us like we we'd
hate to see it and we felt guilty at the
time working behind in the container we
said like oh geez like we kind of want
to refund you you had skates on for five
minutes you came and you kind of got
what you wanted in terms of the content
but yeah you'd see especially when we
started reaching out to like micro and
and local influencers
we'd say hey would' love to invite you

[18:01]
we'd say hey would' love to invite you
to come down skating's on us bring a
plus one bring two bring a second plus
one it's on us and for the most part
like people would just eat that up they
like yeah I have I have 50,000 people
followers yeah they capture their
content they'd shoot their real their
Tik Tok and we'd see instant spikes in
bookings the odd time you'd have a
person saying hey like my RAID is this
for for one video and we kind of we
dabbled in that a little bit at the time
but um we we kind of geared our Focus
towards people who are open to kind of
doing a an in-kind Partnership if you
will yeah because you didn't need it
right like the I mean what what was an
average rate for someone that did charge
that's a good question anywhere from 150
to 250 which again not going to break
the bank these these might have been
people with 15,000 followers but like
super engaged super local a lot of
foodie folks Toronto being very much a a
city of of food and multi cultural so

[19:00]
city of of food and multi cultural so
like yeah we tapped into a lot of the
the mom um influencers and and and local
influencers uh it's funny like speaking
of like Mom influencers like I I
listened to the the interview you did
with the pumpkin porch lady and it's
just like yeah if you reach out to the
right folks uh words does organically
spread pretty fast what did it cost to
rent your shipping container was it a 20
or a 40 foot uh so the shipping
container was already on site at the
bentway at the time so we we oh you said
that yeah so we we paid like a I think
was a flat 4K per month again it was it
was TurnKey for us and I don't think you
could plan for a better beginning to a
business um and if we tried to replicate
that or find a similar location with a
like a fabricated TurnKey container we
wouldn't be able to find it today back
to the 4K a month like how do you arrive
at that who did you say it first did
they say it first cuz there's no
precedent for this there's not no I I
truth be told I have no idea I can't
remember who who came to it we we did a
bit of math quick math and probably an
napkin at a time and we said okay well

[20:01]
napkin at a time and we said okay well
if we if we limit our capacity to about
let's say 35 to 50 people per per
session and we have X amount of sessions
per week really we only need like a busy
Saturday in order to to make that money
we did open up like going back uh to to
the the journalists and the local media
we' reached out maybe months in advance
so like the hype train had already kind
of left the station people were already
talking about it and one article would
um influence another article or
publication so by the time that we open
bookings which might have been a month
or two out we were already like bringing
in money before we'd paid uh any rent
now did the 4,000 scare you in the
beginning or were you so optimistic that
it would crush that you didn't care yeah
we were we were scared even like the
initial I I think overall our initial
investment at the time was probably give
or take 35k so that got us the the skate
inventory the protective gear it got our

[21:01]
inventory the protective gear it got our
insurance we we made the Wix website at
the time we we used the plugin to
capture online bookings um so we were
yeah every dollar mattered back then as
it it still does today um but it was
kind of our neck on the line we we we
fully staffed it the entire summer
ourselves which looking back I had just
met my my NE fiance I was like this girl
is willing to give up her Wednesday her
Thursday her Friday and she's all day
Saturday and Sunday so I was like she's
a
keeper yeah did you pay her we didn't
pay ourselves we did not pay ourselves
until we've only just fully both paid
ourselves back in the last 12 months and
then yeah we were kind of just very
focused on like right is this something
that we we we see a future in um if it
is there's really no point in paying
ourselves until we need a paycheck
because yeah you want to take money out
of the business when we could just
reinvest it so we kept a lot of we we
reinvested a lot of any surplus money

[22:01]
reinvested a lot of any surplus money
and cash up until again 12 months ago
when we paid ourselves back and now we
take a very modest kind of paycheck from
the business we both still have our
full-time jobs which is something that
we would love to transition away from
it's a little bit of that kind of golden
handcuffs we we want to jump in but you
know you got a mortgage now and life is
expensive so we don't want to make and
it's seasonal too right yeah yeah
especially and and even now with the
indoor locations um we we choose not to
be year round we we model ourselves off
of Spirit Halloween when we want to
create that fomo that urgency we're in
town for six to eight months come by
while while we're in town before we roll
to the next town what types of jobs do
you two have and how like how much time
does it take yeah so my partner is a
copywriter um I work in advertising
sales we both at the time like we it was
definitely a Juggle between the the and
the full-time job now that we've hired

[23:01]
the full-time job now that we've hired
out like we we have an on-site manager
working in the business less and working
on the business more but yeah that first
summer was definitely we taking a couple
half days on a Friday and and running
down to the bentway to make sure that we
could open up in time for people to
arrive at 5:00 p.m. or or 4:30 whatever
it was so it was it was a Juggle but you
know like the the endorphins are flowing
the excitement is there it was our first
business we were a new couple together
and then yeah seeing this organic reach
from local media at the time and just
seeing back-to-back sessions booked out
we were like this is like it was it was
thrilling okay so what were you charging
that first year versus what do you
charge today and let's talk a little bit
about margins and what that looks like
yeah pricing hasn't really changed all
that much so we charge $18 for the first
hour and so sessions typically four to
five 5 to 6 p.m. hour long if you skate
for two hours it's a it's kind of it's
25 so a small jump if you rent skates

[24:00]
25 so a small jump if you rent skates
for 3 hours which few people do they
normally tap out after about an hour or
or two it's $30 if you have your own
skates at the time because the bentway
was a public space we didn't charge for
people to bring their own Skates um so
that was something that we do charge for
now that we have a kind of a private uh
unit ourselves and then protective gear
was an add-on we'd always include risk
cards with any rentals just because if
somebody's falling they're more than
likely going to fall on on the wrists
and then knee pads elbow pads and helmet
could be rented for $2 each or I think
we did a bundle for five bucks let's say
the average ticket was probably give or
take $26 per person it's one of those
activities too that 90% of people are
going to do with another person they're
going to go on a date night or they're
going to go with a group of friends so
all of a sudden like that that $26
multiplied by four could be closer to
yeah 100 plus dollars per per group wow
yeah I mean if a middle-aged Dude shows

[25:00]
yeah I mean if a middle-aged Dude shows
up by himself to skate he's probably a
Sero yeah well and we had a few of them
you know and we had people back
religiously and we knew people by name
and again I think it was just the idea
of like wow it's so cool seeing this
back in Vogue back on Trend like I
remember this when I was XYZ age and
then yeah people just telling other
people and bringing their kids and
coming on date nights it was it was very
cool to see so if you're looking at like
25 bucks a person give or take what is a
busy day look like as far as revenue and
number of customers we've always kind of
Benchmark ourselves like a good day
would be between two and 3K okay so 100
people yeah yeah I'm I'm bad at doing
math off the top of my head so in terms
of the the number the number of people
unsure but definitely if we're if we're
hitting 2K plus that would be like a a
pretty pretty good day h on a weekend
because we we wear open those extra
hours that could increase to anywhere
from 3 to 4K we have private bookings we
had people interested in we had Brands

[26:01]
had people interested in we had Brands
approach us and looking to do branded
like events yeah as I said we were we
were Off to the Races with the with the
organic local media to start and then
just because of the the user generated
content word got out fast and it's
probably two of the big reasons why
we're still doing it today is because
it's um people do typically want to post
about it yeah I mean even if you don't
have the local media you're freaking in
the middle of downtown a bunch of people
rolling skating like it draws the eye
right yeah lot a lot of organic footfall
at the time too so even if people did
walk by and didn't want to skate right
there and then chances are they would
they could come back a week later or a
month later now is it common for people
to bring their own skates or no it is
common yeah it's it's surprisingly not
as niche as as one might think like for
for a lot of your listeners now they're
like roller skating like I get it I used
to do it I've done it once or twice but
they're like it is a sizable Niche you
know people es especially now
with kind of the well since Co covid and

[27:02]
with kind of the well since Co covid and
lockdowns and mental health like it's as
much for a lot of people and a lot of
the community that we are now ingrained
with it is as much for them about mental
health as it is physical health the idea
of getting Outdoors being active like
and it's a good workout like we have
people like they'll be like talking
about their quads and their calfs and
they'll be like dripping sweat so and
then as people get older too it's it's
it's low impact so you like we have
eight olds and we have 80y olds there's
not very many other recreational
activities that I can see you see that
kind of lifespan which is maybe why is
pick a ball is so popular now like I was
just gonna say that yeah but it's yeah
super social and then people too like
when when there's a more experienced
skater and they're skating next to a
more novice skater a lot of times people
are very open to giving instructions and
feedback and tips and tricks and as as a
Nova skater like you're very willing to
take that that advice and and the tips
and tricks because it's going to be like

[28:01]
and tricks because it's going to be like
hey I'm going to be on my knees or on my
wrists or I'm going to take this
feedback and so it's it's a you see
people learning and picking picking it
up very quick now where are you getting
the equipment from are from China is
there like a a big vendor yeah so we
actually get it through a wholesaler in
the US called Ruby skates we the skates
themselves are a German company called
Kaa or cha depending on on your
pronunciation and they are manufactured
in Asia but they are premium
top-of-the-line retail skates so that
was one thing that we wanted to be a
differentiator from from the get-go we
didn't want your kind of traditional
orange toe stop like outdated skates
that looked like they'd been 200 years
old we wanted like to get premium skates
with titanium trucks and ones that had a
pop a color so that if people are
posting videos photos reals whatever it
might be that instantly they see wow

[29:00]
might be that instantly they see wow
like that that's that those skates that
that's a Vibe and so like that first
season we had like turquoise we had pink
we had yellow we had blue now our
colorways are more kind of teal green
and red but to this day we still still
use the same Skate brand I was just
going to ask like you didn't start with
something cheap and then upgrade after
learning that no and we we could like
gez we we probably buy our skates for 80
80 us uh a unit or per pair so they're
certainly not cheap but they've lasted I
mean we've probably gone through quite a
few broken skates over the course of
three or four years now but they've
stood the test of time and I think it it
doesn't go unnoticed you know when
people are putting on a premium skate
there's extra ankle support people don't
mind spending the $18 plus change if
they know they're getting
top-of-the-line skates uh as well as
premium protective gear do you sell the
skates at all we haven't that that was
that's always been on our radar
especially with the the I guess the
upward trajectory of Ecom and Shopify
during during Co but it's just it's it's

[30:01]
during during Co but it's just it's it's
another Beast you know with with the
operations of the of the the the popups
and then you want to throw in sales and
fulfillment definitely doable and we we
actually had we've had a number of
samples made in China with our own
colorways and our own brand none of them
have ever been as high quality as the
skates we we currently use in our rental
program and it's always taking a little
bit more time to find these factories in
China or elsewhere in Asia get the
samples delivered and then you have
feedback like it's it's it's a lengthy
process so we haven't gone down that
rabbit hole just yet okay well while
we're talking about the quality of the
skates let's talk about insurance and
how you went about finding that for
something so random and what your costs
are like yeah Insurance probably the the
most important part of the whole thing
um we how do we go about it
we we approached a number of Brokers at
at the time the Brokers like many other
Brokers they flood the market with um
with their knowledge and they come back

[31:01]
with their knowledge and they come back
to you with with offers I think
ultimately the the
insurance broker that we went with was
was a friend of a friend or if if I
remember correctly it was a a friend of
ours brother-in-law he was in the
insurance game long story short they had
all their their due diligence their
questions are you providing protective
gear are you insuring are are you making
helmets mandatory is the risk guards yes
we're providing risk guards for free
everything else is kind of a an add-on
what's the surface like the
insurance I again if I remember
correctly it was probably 7,000 for the
duration of that first year popup not
extraordinarily like didn't break the
bank yeah most we we had waivers to this
day we obviously have waivers the hope
is that no accidents
happen that's called a spade of spade
people do do fall we have had a couple
of broken bones over the course of the
last three or four years touch wood they
there hasn't been too many I guess what

[32:01]
there hasn't been too many I guess what
what we do and I'm like sure what most
PE most
other recreational businesses do and
even other small businesses you got to
just really limit your liability do your
due diligence make sure that the surface
is clean make sure that the skates are
tight and in good work working order we
do have the the waiver which is it's
compulsory to be signed before anyone
gets on skates so thankfully that hasn't
been uh too much of an issue or too
cumbersome so far all right if you are
watching this clip right now you are
watching this on YouTube and if you are
a fan of podcast please check out my
podcast while you're at it because
sometimes I have podcasts that aren't on
YouTube and sometimes I have YouTubes
that aren't on podcast so check out the
ker office on any podcast platform or
you can go to TKO pod.com also my
newsletter will throw that in there
there're no ads It's weekly it's
different content than my podcast and
YouTube newsletter. chrisj cerner.com
You'll see the link and we'll see you
there what is your setup look like like
your point of sale for for the bentway
anyway like what kind of Hardware do you
use you have like a tent
yeah so we the so the shipping container

[33:00]
yeah so we the so the shipping container
itself had uh had like a flip out
counter and Awning so we we operated out
of the shipping container if you can
imagine like a as as a an ice cream
truck he would operate out of the the
window of the ice cream van or a truck
okay um so same for us we had two iPads
at the time the iPads ran on data
because we were outside there was no
Wi-Fi and we had Square as our kind of
payment processor so for any in-person
bookings we would transact through
through Square two
iPods um trying to think Peak Pro which
was our third party online booking
provider 95% of our bookings to this day
and even back then come from online
probably probably a little bit less now
now that we're in busier footfall malls
there there's more of a balance between
in-person bookings and online but at the
time definitely there was probably
upwards of 90% of our bookings were made
pre like prepaid made online reminder
emails confirm confirmation email sent
um people would sign their waiver

[34:00]
um people would sign their waiver
digitally so that when they arrived we
would recommend hey arrive 5 10 minutes
before your skate time we check you in
we take your shoes put them in the Kobe
where your skates are being taken from
and yeah they were good to go what about
lessons is that a is is that a sizable
portion of your business I wouldn't say
sizable it's definitely something that
has been requested from from day one uh
and something that we do offer for us we
see it almost as a marketing program
program if you will our thinking is that
hey if someone comes for for a lesson
the chances are is they're going to come
back and they're going to put that
knowledge into practice so we don't make
a huge amount of money off of our
lessons but we we do offer them in the
hope that someone will take them they
might we do offer memberships now which
is kind of relatively new and still
figuring out and and and toying with
with memberships but uh yeah the hope is
that people will come back again and
again and uh and skate for as long as
possible
obviously like in the beginning when

[35:00]
obviously like in the beginning when
this like you knew it was blowing up on
Tik Tok and everywhere I'm sure one of
like that your concerns were like is
this a fad like is this going to be
around in Year how have you been
surprised or Not by that initial concern
I think that the kind of rhetoric around
is that a fad can be applied in my
opinion to to virtually anything so
whether it's spinning and soul cycle
whether it's Barry's boot camp whether
it's people cycling or skiing
in our opinion getting a young person or
an old person a child or an adult or a
parent away from their digital device I
think that's always going to be popular
yeah and I think it's only getting more
popular so if you offer whether it's a a
pumpkin patch or a maze or a world of
Barbie experience I think anything that
gets people pickable um anything that
gets people off the couch off the sofa
away from their digital devices and
active with friends and family
I think has the opportunity to be a

[36:00]
I think has the opportunity to be a
business for the long run now whether it
goes through es and flows which roller
skating has and and which most
recreational activities do I think
that's that's natural but I do think the
big difference there's two big
difference well the biggest difference
now versus when roller skating was
really popular in the 50s 60s 7s is that
we now have Tik Tok and Instagram we now
have people sharing and reposting and
liking all of their their visuals and
the aesthetic of roller skating we
didn't have that in the past and it is
something that's super super visual you
know like being from Ireland I didn't
really grow up with quad roller skating
but if you ask me five or 10 years ago
like what what what what comes to mind
when you think of roller skating I think
of palm trees I think of California I
think of nostalgic Good Vibes I think of
like the sun shining and I think all
those things just evoke a happy feeling
of people to this day yeah I agreed it's
just a good brand like it's just the
activity itself is just so wholesome so

[37:01]
activity itself is just so wholesome so
I think that alone means it has staying
power the a framework that I like to use
for something that could be seen as a
fad especially in retail is like let's
say like frozen yogurt shops right 15
years ago they were everywhere now
there's less of them but the best
locations survive yep right they got
it's got to taste good but really at the
end of the day if you had to choose
between taste and like an amazing
location the location wins and so sounds
like you're you're doing that yeah and
and I think nothing is is is forever you
know like what we're doing at the
bentway or what we did at the bentway
has changed somewhat to what we're doing
today and what we're doing in in two and
five years from now maybe slightly
different than what we're doing today so
with with anything I think there will be
a a Natural Evolution to the not only to
the activity but to also the business
what does Staffing look like on it like
a really busy Saturday versus a really
slow day how many people do you need to
have there yeah it's a good question I

[38:00]
have there yeah it's a good question I
would say on a really slow day you could
get away with two staff especially like
the fact that we start started the
business and there was just the two of
us we know that hey if it is a slower
Wednesday or Thursday or Friday you can
definitely manage with two people it's a
little bit hectic and you might want
that third just for for Comfort reasons
on a busier day you're definitely
looking closer to five um we still model
ourselves like with our indoor locations
and malls we keep it pretty streamlined
like we don't really have a snack
program we offer drinks and beverages
for a few dollars just as Refreshments
but like we we don't go into outfitting
the space and bathrooms we typically
redirect people to the the public
washrooms in the the mall because we're
taking over these 40 50 60,000 square
feet units that may not have been um
occupied in the last five or 10 years um
so it's we keep it trying we try and
keep it streamlined and uh with that

[39:01]
keep it streamlined and uh with that
we're able to reduce the the staff
numbers so let's talk about the mall
strategy what what got you thinking
about that you were just tapped out at
the bentway you need a second location
across town how did you find the mall
manager what does that look like yeah
it's an interesting one It's Kind of a
Funny Story So at the time during the
bentway my girlfriend and I were going
to workout classes but the workout
classes because all the gyms were closed
they were hosted on the rooftop Park
deck of a downtown mall a nearby Mall
had struck up a deal with the with the
mall and said hey like we can't we can't
operate our classes indoors can we use
your vacant rooftop parking garage so we
were going to to these workout classes
all summer long and it kind of dawned on
us at the time like hey like this mall
Cadillac Fairview is the name of the
owner and operator of this mall and they
own tens of mes if not hundreds across
Canada and the US we said hey if if
these guys vacant retail space here in
downtown in the downtown core of Toronto

[40:01]
downtown in the downtown core of Toronto
maybe they have vacant either retail or
parking garage space elsewhere so fast
forward a couple of weeks we we find out
that Cadillac Fairview is the the owner
operator of the mall we reach out to
them we say hey we've done this
successfully at the bentway for the last
three months we'd love to discuss maybe
just um turning any vacant space you
have into a pop-up roller rink they came
back and they pitched us they came back
and said hey we have x amount of malls
throughout Ontario please please take
our malls yeah which is which is the the
province that that Toronto that that
we're located in and they said yeah we
have all of these malls we have indoor
vacant space we have outdoor vacant
space we have parking garages we have
parking lots um so it was almost like
again as we were very lucky with the
bentway we also got very lucky with our
second location ultimately we landed on
the a
rooftop location they rooftop parking
garage was closed at the time so it
wasn't even open um there was yeah it

[41:01]
wasn't even open um there was yeah it
was P4 so there was three levels
underneath including the ground floor
and they said hey like do you want to
come do a site visit and see if the
surface is smooth enough we did that we
we checked out the the surface it was
not smooth enough so we're like whacking
our brains trying to figure out okay
like how can we how can we make this
work because like if you can put roller
skating on a rooftop and capture the
sunsets like that's that's going to be
that's going to be a Vibe even better so
yeah we we looked into sports tiles is
kind of like the same type of material
plastic material tile that a basketball
court or a pickle ball court might be
made out of we invested in in in
probably 20,000 square feet of those and
then that was that was season two we
returned to the bentway and we had our
our second location on on a rooftop
those tiles are expensive because I've
looked into building a pickle ball court
in my backyard did you get them from
China or from a like we got them from a
local distributor here in Canada I
believe we probably paid about $4 per
per square foot maybe it wasn't 20are
foot actually now that I'm thinking

[42:00]
foot actually now that I'm thinking
about it maybe it was closer to like 8
or 10,000 sare ft I think all in we we
we spent about 30k in tiles which was a
huge investment at the time but again we
weren't paying ourselves from the first
season any money that we profited we put
right back into obtaining a container
getting that container outfitted getting
it craned up to the rooftop um we wanted
to operate just like we did the previous
year out of a refurbish shipping
container and then the only other aspect
was getting getting a smooth surface it
probably wasn't as smooth as we would
have liked but the novelty of having a
pop-up roller rink on a rooftop um was
definitely novel and new and again yeah
we were off the races and it it proved
super popular um that that first summer
and what did you have to pay the
management company in rent for that I
think because we had paid the bentway
give or take for 4K per month we kind of
had that in our in our mind what we've
since learned with working with MES
which is probably the most interesting
aspect of of the business and and and

[43:00]
aspect of of the business and and and
working with malls in general is that it
can be really Case by case in terms of
the price point that you pay if you're
talking to a specialty leasing person
within a mall it's their job to bring in
revenue for that mall whereas if you get
contacted or if you get introduced to
the marketing manager all of a sudden
they are the ones with the budget so
we've had cases where we've worked with
MS and our direct point of contact has
been the marketing director or marketing
person and they've paid us to be there
for a month popup and we've had other
very similar scenarios whereby our point
of contact has been specially Leasing
and it's their job to make use of any
unused space um so I think at the time
to answer your question it was probably
in around 4,500 5,000 per month and then
I think if there was anything over 30k
per month or 35k in Revenue they might
get a small kickb which is common for
malls right which yes super common for
malls and then you'd have to disclose
your sales on a monthly basis but yeah

[44:01]
your sales on a monthly basis but yeah
that opened up our eyes to like wow like
these
malls they have they have vacant space
like if if there's one thing that there
is a lot of in North America it's
parking lots so it was just a matter of
presenting it to them in a sexy PDF and
a in a presentation deck and say hey
like we can utilize your space we can
bring extra footfall to your other
retailers we can increase the dwell time
we can even collaborate with local
restaurants on date nights so like for
the for the mall marketing manager or
the specialty leasing manager we were
essentially making their job super easy
they was like what these guys they seem
to know what they're doing they're going
to activate a space and they're going to
drive young teens and 20 and 30y olds
which was kind of like our our core
demographic to our properties which is
what everyone wants yeah then they can
go shop at anre Paul exact what an
interesting framework I've never thought
of this or heard of this and it's not
like you did it intentionally but you
you learned it and it's like don't sell
into the profit centers of another

[45:00]
into the profit centers of another
company because they're in the business
of generating profit for their company
sell into the cost centers the Cent
looking to spend money to grow their
business that was the big unlock there
right that's kind of what's what's what
launched our our now mobile version of
what we do with the van because we were
seeing these mall marketing managers and
they would spend pull a figure from the
sky they might have spent five or 10K
over Christmas getting Santa there they
might have spent
another amount over Easter to do an
Easter egg hunt in the M it's their job
to ensure that there's High foot traffic
in their properties if they can get high
foot traffic they can get big retailers
they can get the Apple they can get the
anthropology they can get the lululemons
and the aritzia of the world so like
they have budget there for us it was
like right we we want to be receiving
this budget we don't want to be spending
uh into theirs so yeah very organic we
had never worked with MES before we
didn't have any kind of retail
background but yeah it's been super
interesting navigating our way through

[46:02]
interesting navigating our way through
the the retail Mall landscape and just
seeing the commonalities between each
different property and how a lot of them
now are migrating from your traditional
mall to mix use developments somewhere
where you can go and you can you can do
your spin class you can you can do your
grocery shopping but you can also live
there so it's I think over the coming
five or 10 years it's going to be
interesting to see a lot of the
traditional malls
be kind of these Community epic centers
I interviewed a guy on this podcast
months ago who who teaches kids how to
use heavy equipment in a mall parking
lot yeah yeah yeah we see that our
current pop up right now there's and I'd
never seen it before but there's um
there's a company utilizing maybe 200
Park parking spaces spaces and they are
teaching people how to ride motorcycles
um and again they're operating from a 40
foot shipping container but seeing a
business like that which would be
perfect for the for the podcast I can't
help but like get the gears turning in
my head but like wow there's like if

[47:01]
my head but like wow there's like if
there's one thing there's so much of
it's It's parking lot spaces so whether
it's some like a maze I've toyed with
the idea of like a turning a parking lot
into a maze just around Halloween or
whatever it may be but uh funny you say
that I I thought of making it was my
friend's idea I don't want to steal it
but he thought of making like a maze in
a parking lot outside a Spirit Halloween
like a Halloween Maze and then just
convert it to a Christmas maze yeah
genius you know what I I and you could
charge five bucks a piece even like at
least 10 10 bucks for the whole family
15 bucks and like you break it down put
it in a put it in a storage unit for the
eight months yeah and it would be
popular build it again yeah 100% okay so
what happens with rain do you do you
offer like rain checks and how often is
that a factor yeah it is it's a factor
and it's why we've PIV it away from
outdoor locations because there are just
too many variables especially with the
rooftop with the wind the rain there was
no coverage versus the vent way was 80
90% covered if it rains we we would

[48:00]
90% covered if it rains we we would
typically keep a close eye on the the
weather forecast the radar we try our
very best to send out Advanced
notification and saying hey we've got a
cancel due to bad weather um in that
confirm in that in that notification
email there would be a link for the the
skater or the the guest to rebook their
own um skate let's say out of every 100
skaters you might get three to I don't
know five to 10 skaters that say hey
like I was just in town for the weekend
like rescheduling is not really going to
be be be possible for me and in that
case we just we we issue a refund yeah
um we did like to and we still do like
to say we're non-refundable we would
rather just keep the the customer
service on point and say hey if it's if
it if it means you'll come back in the
future and you want to Refund Now
absolutely we we'll share a refund now
are you still on that same mall parking
lot roof today or did you move away from
that so this past season was our last
season there that was a decision
we were toying with the idea of not
going back this past summer just for for

[49:00]
going back this past summer just for for
for that reason really it there's so
many variables there's wind there's rain
we learned too that you really have to
be activating and programming around the
skates so like we did we toyed with
having food vendors up there and again
very cumbersome you're nearly spending
more time managing the the food vendors
than you are focused on your your core
business so this past season we wrapped
up if my memory serves me end of
September maybe mid September
and we we we won't be returning there so
we're actually in the process now of
selling these Sports tiles uh and
focusing on indoor locations in the
winter time a lot of people building
pickle ball ports that courts that would
buy those yeah actually sold of the I
think eight or 10,000 square feet we've
so give or take half but yeah basketball
courts tennis courts and pickable courts
now how did that first season go at the
roof like your first season with two
locations were there any like breaking
points how did it go it went well it
went yeah it was it was profitable again
overheads were low we we had the

[50:01]
overheads were low we we had the
investment of the tiles we had we had to
buy additional inventory protective gear
we found a secondhand shipping container
again 20 foot shipping container we
retrofitted that on a on a modest budget
it wasn't excuse me it wasn't too sexy
by any means do you like paint it or
wrap it or make it look it it it was a
funny story so the mall had actually
already half retrofitted two shipping
containers
and they were sitting in a yard
somewhere in Toronto and they said they
connected us with the person who who was
holding the containers in their yard so
we essentially on behalf of the mall
moved the shipping containers and
organized for a crane to Crane it up to
P4 of the the rooftop but the mall had
already painted they were black but they
were like a matte black freshly painted
the mall had already painted and
organized that prior to us being in the
picture so all we had to do was put
shelving units just standard ply wall or
plywood wooden shelving units in the

[51:01]
plywood wooden shelving units in the
container um I'm trying to think back
yeah big learnings from that year don't
underestimate the wind on a rooftop
because that's that is that is real
weather is obviously a big a big
indicator of how successful you are if
you have a a rainy June and you're
relying on a busy July August September
all of a sudden you're you're kind of
cutting yourself short of of a full
season a lot of that has led to again
again just us Focus focusing in on
indoor locations where there's just less
variables and it's uh it's just more
predictive uh predictive foot footfall
you were mentioning you you were
probably using around 10,000 square feet
up there and my gut reaction was man is
that enough and then I used to rent a
warehouse that was 10,000 square feet
and that's that's pretty dang big like
it it would probably be bigger than your
average like roller skating rink so what
is like the square footage that you need
or prefer for any concept whether it's
mobile from a van or rooftop or
bentway yeah I think for for the van now

[52:02]
bentway yeah I think for for the van now
now that we're doing a lot more mobile
events and we come to you type of of uh
of events our rule of thumb is the
minimum is the size of a basketball
court or a tennis court so I'm actually
unsure what the exact square footage of
that is but if you have a space that is
away from Vehicles that's safe uh that's
cordoned off in some capacity and that
has a super smooth surface we can get
you skating we've done smaller we've we
did the Pinterest holiday party last
December in their office on the sixth
floor of a downtown office building not
ideal but I mean you kind of make do you
know it's I think for the most part
whether you're the event organizer
managing the event and the L Logistics
or you're the attendee of the the
holiday party or in this case the the
Pinterest staff there's a certain
appreciation but like all right we're
kind of working with what we have it's
not as as big or or as as maybe smooth
as a a traditional roller rink but the

[53:00]
as a a traditional roller rink but the
idea yeah I think people are just more
understanding the fact that like it is a
it's a novel kind of popup and what are
the unit economics of your mobile
concept do you charge anything
differently what do you pay the parking
lot Etc yeah good questions so for the
mobile iteration of what we do now what
we like to coin are roaming roller van
we have a few different pricing tiers
depending on who who's booking so if
we're doing a school event we want to
try which is we've decided to Discount
because again we're kind of still we've
only had the van since May and we're
we're still tweaking the price point the
feedback from a lot of teachers
Educators principles is that we want to
make this as accessible to all students
from of of all backgrounds so we try and
get it to as close to 1518 $20 per
student um but then we'll put in a
minimum hey we'll come to your school
but we have to do a minimum of students
and then all those 60 students will
break it into three 45 minute sessions

[54:02]
break it into three 45 minute sessions
or three hourong sessions our sweet spot
in terms of the the quantity of skates
that we can fit in the back of the van
our sweet spot is around 25 skaters per
session so whether those sessions are 45
minutes long or an hour long if we can
get 60 students uh skating we're in the
clear we're making money we're paying
two staff the logistics travel time the
setup all covered now if we're doing a
corporate event like a the Pinterest
holiday party for example rewind a
little bit for a school event it would
typically be that a three-hour session
so three 45 minute sessions three hours
in total if we're doing a corporate
event or a community event we work with
a lot of municipalities to get their
communities
rolling we will have longer a longer
event time so we'll have a 5H hour skate
period so we might have instead of it
being three 45 minute sessions we'll
have five 45 minute sessions and we'll
get between 125 and 150 skaters skating

[55:02]
get between 125 and 150 skaters skating
IND that duration so for something like
that we charge
4,950 and again that's an all-inclusive
TurnKey price includes staff logistic
travel time skate rentals protective
gear public liability insurance waivers
um so again if you're the office manager
booking the holiday party or you are
working in the rec recreational
department for uh the city of Dallas
Texas and you want to offer this as a
free activity to the community we roll
up no pun intended and it is just yeah
TurnKey what is your average profit for
a job like that like a mobile job it's a
good questions when I comes to margins
I'm I'm not the I'm not the the wisest I
know a profit margins typically with the
traditional popups are anywhere between
30 and 40% they're a lot healthier with
with the with our mobile van event
friendly uh format the reason being is

[56:00]
friendly uh format the reason being is
our overheads they were already low with
the the shipping container and the the
popups but with our new event friendly
format we have our our van lease we have
our our two staff which we're only
paying if if we're booked for the van to
we already had the inventory so we just
decided hey we might as well put this to
use instead of it being in a storage
locker in a public storage let's put it
on racks put the Roll the racks up the
ramp in to the back of the the van I'd
say our margins are probably closer to
60 70% man you I mean you can't even
really count like you said the van into
the margins because you already owned it
we already owned the inventory yeah we
leased the van so any monthly fee to
anyone for those jobs right yeah I think
same amount of employees same amount of
yeah and and we've been blessed with
employee employees sticking around so
like our manager our manager who manages
a lot of our our van events or our
mobile events has been with us since
that that second location our first roof
top location that that we talked about
he knows skating inside out now he's

[57:00]
he knows skating inside out now he's
become a skater typically two staff one
van will have four racks with up to 85
pairs of skates in the back we have
protective gear our newest edition is a
10x10 fully branded beautiful tent the
van is branded to very same as the tent
the idea is yeah we get to to an event
an hour before the event kicks off will
be set up in no more than 25 to 35
minutes the staff might go grab a coffee
keep hydrated get some water they're
kind of at the check-in tent desk area
15 minutes before skaters arrive and
then yeah the events will typically run
either two three or five hours get as
many skaters kind of through the door
because we're we're paid in advance up
front from the the event organizer or
the host and then pack up the van
another 35 minutes and we're out of
there beautiful I mean you're paid up
front like that it seems like you're
leaning into the right model I think so
and yeah we we did
I'm not sure if we haven't really posted
much about this because the outcome
wasn't the best but we were on the

[58:01]
wasn't the best but we were on the
Canadian version of Shark Tank called
Dragons Den so we did that last summer
we didn't get a deal and the feedback
that we got was it was interesting uh
especially because a lot of the the the
judges or the dragons at the time came
from a retail background their feedback
was like but how long is this vacant
retail space and more space going to be
around you know Ms will bounce back yeah
retail will bounce back but I think
there was some Merit in that and it
opened our eyes to the fact that if we
can get paid upfront if we can work with
some of these like we've worked with
Crest Fujifilm Neutrogena we've worked
with the Four Seasons Pinterest if we
can get work with these type of Brands
and we can H get paid up front and our
margins are are are are lower because
we're just super efficient with with
this van and it's it's a lot more
scalable too like we can if somebody in
Texas said hey like and that's kind of
where we're at right now we we want to
open this up
to maybe a franchise Maybe just a
license maybe to say hey like we're
going to sell the blueprint you can you
can call it like Roll Tide

[59:02]
can call it like Roll Tide
skates and that's a good one yeah that
all time roller for Western Central
Alabama that would crush yeah I think
that that that is the next step for us
is like we could do the franchise and we
could have more um more control over the
brand and and and and expand the brand
and and we are looking into that Avenue
but we're also open to the idea of like
let's let's packaged our information our
knowledge over the last four years and
instead of instead of selling it to 500
franchises uh or a thousand franchises
maybe 5,000 people will license the the
business plan I would license it if I
were you just because I just know how
expensive franchising is and how long it
takes you could force people to go
through your point of sale take a
percentage there you could force them to
buy your gear now people will go around
you of course but on the whole they
won't cuz they want it to work it's not
rocket science too you know we bought it
a Ford Transit fan we wrapped it in sexy
branding we have skates on shelves we

[1:00:00]
branding we have skates on shelves we
have protective gear like anyone else
can can do it and for any listener that
wants to do it yeah reach out we we'll
tell you how it's done so yeah for us I
think the license model and like again
we are if if we could see an iteration
of what we've done with our van in a
different geography whether it be Texas
Florida California like that's super
cool yeah that is cool now have you seen
many competitors pop up at least around
you no so there there's been one big uh
permanent rink um which was opened in
the last two years a lot of money went
into it I wouldn't even be able to
Fathom how much money and investment it
took the big thing that we've learned is
the seasonality of it people want to be
outdoors in the summertime and they want
to be indoors in the winter time at
least up up up in Canada so if you have
an outdoor rink in the summertime you
can't operate in the in the winter and
if you have an indoor rink in the winter
time you don't want to be operating in
the summer months because it's dead
people want to be outdoors which is why

[1:01:00]
people want to be outdoors which is why
we've kind of fine-tuned our our current
pop-up model to be very very similar to
a spe at Halloween we want to be in
around August we want to be set up in
time for back to school September time
frame we want to ride through the full
Halloween Christmas Valentine's Day
Easter midterm break and we want to be
out of a particular location by end of
May end of April early May once the
weather starts turning and people want
to be outdoors again so that's that's
kind of the the the most recent
iteration of the the popup model smart
it I'm sure you've had this thought a
dozen times but it's like why would you
build a rink yeah like you want to get
into this business why I I had an
interview with another guy that was in
the swim business and like you've got
swim franchises spending a million
dollars to put an indoor pool in like
next to a Hobby Lobby when he just like
borrows pool yeah and is wildly
profitable like well that it goes back
to one of the big reasons why I think we
will go down the the route of Licensing
versus franchising like when I see some

[1:02:00]
versus franchising like when I see some
of these other brands not anything to do
with roller skating like it might be
window cleaning and I'm sure you've come
across the pinks and it's like charging
50 Grand franchise fee like that's not
accessible to the average person let
alone like a Starbucks or a McDonald's
franchise fee which is probably sets you
back a million two million plus we want
to create something that the average 20
to 40 year old can be like you know what
all I need is 50k all in assuming they
leas the van but we want to make it as
affordable to as many as
possible that's amazing this was so so
good they don't usually go this long but
what are we on now I just I could talk
over an hour nice hour hour yeah this is
good so thank you for your time is there
any anything you'd like to leave us with
