[00:00]
If Mr. Beast can do this with video
ideas, you and or I can do this with
business ideas, right? It's too
demoralizing to sell something for 40
bucks a month. You're like, "All right,
200 more of these,"
&gt;&gt; right? It's tough. Versus like the
garage cleanout guy, if he's charging
700 bucks, it's like, "All right, he
needs [music] to do one garage clean out
a day and he's chilling. He's making
21." Anyone can go and do that. You're
working 6 hours a day. You're making
20,000 bucks a month. Someone go make
your 20 grand a month, dude. I promise
you can.
&gt;&gt; This is gonna be so fun. I've always
wanted to do this. I've never done this.
If Mr. Beast can do this with video
ideas, you and or I can do this with
business ideas. All right. Random word
generator.
&gt;&gt; Cool.
&gt;&gt; Let's say three words.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; More words, harder it gets. Right.
&gt;&gt; Cool.
&gt;&gt; Word type. All. We're going to use these
three random words to come up with a
business idea that someone could use to
make 20 grand a month profit.
&gt;&gt; All right. Bet, dude. I'm in.
&gt;&gt; Okay. You ready?
&gt;&gt; Let's go. Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; This is not edited. Muhammad is not

[01:01]
&gt;&gt; This is not edited. Muhammad is not
involved.
&gt;&gt; No, we're in. [clears throat]
&gt;&gt; Here we go. Vague office.
&gt;&gt; Vague. Okay. I got an idea. I got an
idea. There it is. There it is. We're
going to make a chess set that's themed
of the office.
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; that's it.
&gt;&gt; That's it.
&gt;&gt; You're going to have like the king is
Michael Scott. The queen is Jan. Oh my
gosh. I thought like a millisecond.
Vague. What's vague about it? What's
vague about it? Maybe there's like a
golden ticket reward in there where you
could win like an autograph piece of
memorabilia from the set. One in a
thousand chest kits.
&gt;&gt; Golden ticket.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Charlie Ker over here, DUDE.
&gt;&gt; LET'S GO. [screaming]
&gt;&gt; YEAH. SORRY. I JUMPED THE GUN. WHAT?
&gt;&gt; NO, that's okay. I'm with it. I like
that one the most. I was going chess,
but I was going ebook. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; Okay. Oh, chess ebook all day. That's a
valuable
&gt;&gt; audience 100%.
&gt;&gt; Oh my gosh, it's so funny.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Well, how do we get to 20K a month
though? I mean, this is just going to be
a Facebook ads.
&gt;&gt; Just Facebook ads straight up, dude. And
then the thing that I like, I want a

[02:01]
then the thing that I like, I want a
recurring on the back. And so, it's like
anyone that buys that is a a very
specific group of people. And so, it's
like, cool, launch a little paid uh
Facebook community for it and be like,
"Yep, these are office lovers that love
chess. This is your people. Like, come
hang out, learn chess, do your thing."
&gt;&gt; Oh, dude.
&gt;&gt; You have cameos from the the people in
there. Who's a guy that's on Cameo? He
does so many.
&gt;&gt; Brian Bumgardner.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Imagine you just pay
him to give
&gt;&gt; chess tips.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You just on Cameo. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; Like idiotic chess tips.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, dude. He's just like explaining
different moves and stuff. That'd be a
phenomenal ad. Are you kidding, dude?
&gt;&gt; Just immediate face recognition.
&gt;&gt; Ramp.
&gt;&gt; So good. So good.
&gt;&gt; Why don't you describe what happened
with that for those that haven't seen
that?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So RMP, I don't know if they did
like a launch or if it was just like a a
random ad campaign, but they put him in
like a glass office box somewhere and he
just like sat there for like eight hours

[03:01]
just like sat there for like eight hours
messing around in the office all
promoting RAM. So cool,
&gt;&gt; dude. What do you think he got paid for
that? Can't have been that much, right?
&gt;&gt; I put it at like a hundred.
&gt;&gt; That much? Really?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Wow.
&gt;&gt; Like I don't think he got paid millions.
I also don't think he got like 10 grand.
&gt;&gt; Okay. I was thinking closer to 10 grand.
really.
&gt;&gt; I don't know what his cameos go for. And
it's like travel and like, you know,
like meteorites and, you know, like all
of that sort of stuff. Like I'd put it
closer to 100.
&gt;&gt; I'm looking up his Cameo cost.
&gt;&gt; 195 bucks for personal video
&gt;&gt; for like what? That's like a minute.
&gt;&gt; Average video length minute 22. That's
good living, man.
&gt;&gt; That tracks, dude.
&gt;&gt; He has 6,000 reviews, which means he's
surely had tens of thousands of
customers. Yeah, he's
&gt;&gt; I heard he's the highest paid cameo
actor.
&gt;&gt; I had I heard the same.
&gt;&gt; That's crazy.
&gt;&gt; You just pop on there. Sorry, dude. 200
bucks an ad creative. You're like,
"Dude, teach them about this chess

[04:01]
"Dude, teach them about this chess
move." You just give them an outline.
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Like, be so funny.
&gt;&gt; I mean, that one's a little costly cuz
we're going to have to
&gt;&gt; You got inventory, you got ads, you got
like you you got to start any ecom
business getting to 20K a month. You got
to be moving units
&gt;&gt; in profit. You got to move units. We can
make a digital chess version. Why not,
&gt;&gt; bro? 100%.
&gt;&gt; An iPhone app that you play with your
friends.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Right. Vibe coded.
&gt;&gt; Yes, dude. 100%. That's the interesting
part now is like with the Vibe Code
stuff, you really can go launch these
little micro SAS products pretty easily.
I think the challenge will be that they
will like come and go, right? Like I
think that you can like blow one up, but
like the barrier to entry is getting
lower and so it's like a little bit more
challenging to like turn that into
something that's like truly sustainable.
&gt;&gt; It would go a really long way if you
just subscribe to this channel. It's
just a good way of saying Chris, thanks
for the value.
&gt;&gt; I think a lot of people think that they
can go and do that to like set and
forget. They're like, I'm going to get
this thing to 20. I'm guilty of that.

[05:01]
this thing to 20. I'm guilty of that.
I'll get it to 20 and it'll just like
exist in perpetuity.
&gt;&gt; That'll never be the case. It's like the
thing will require more and more and
more and more to just continue to grow
&gt;&gt; always.
&gt;&gt; And so I always anyone that pops on
calls me and like I want to launch this,
this, and this. And then I'll just like
have this passive portfolio of like
three apps that I can just go f off and
do whatever. And I'm like, dude, like if
it was that easy, everyone is going to
compete with you. And so like you have
to continue to get better. And so I just
try to figure out like that kind of
balance. I think going back to the
original prompt of like4 million dollar
a year businesses and I think the the
one additional side of the box that I
want to add to it as one person,
&gt;&gt; right? Like if you don't want any
employees,
&gt;&gt; you want to make a quarter million
dollars a year, like where do you live?
Like where do what do you want to do?
The main stuff. So like let's think
boxes, right? So like there's there's
two two boxes. One is digital

[06:00]
two two boxes. One is digital
broadstroke box, right? You're talking
everything from software to ecom to I'd
even give like agency right freelancer
like that sort of world and then you
have physical which is much more local
like pressure washing or stump grinding
or any of those sort of things. And so a
lot of that comes down to like personal
preference and skill level, right? Like
if you're a dad of three kids in Dallas,
Texas, and like friends with a bunch of
people and have a really good local
community, like be pretty easy to launch
a service business kind of around just
your area, right? Like do car washing on
the weekends or you know the one that
funny the one that I saw that was super
interesting was garage cleanouts. Have
you seen I saw that on Twitter? Yeah.
Gary Vee talking by Gary Vee. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I was like,
"That's awesome." I think that the other
guy that does the custom garage storage
that you interviewed. And so there's a
bunch like if you if you want it to be

[07:01]
bunch like if you if you want it to be
like super heavy cash flow quickly, it's
service, right? Like the issue with ecom
on the digital side or even with
software is like you have to actually be
really good at customer acquisition if
you're charging $8 a month for something
because to get to 20, let's just say
easy math again, like say you're
charging 10 bucks a month. To get to 20K
you have to be able to acquire 2,000
customers, right? which generally,
unless you have a big audience or have
the intention of going and building one,
which just will take time, you're
generally looking at an ads game, which
on an $8 or $10 a month subscription,
have fun losing money for your first
year because you're just you're probably
not going to get the CAC to where you
want it to be. And so like the space
that I like and and I'm living it with
unlimited content, like the space that I
really like and I think more people
should kind of try to to live in is like
that $500 to $1,000 a month per customer
world because it's meaningful enough
from a a dollar amount that like you

[08:00]
from a a dollar amount that like you
could get to 20 pretty quick,
&gt;&gt; right?
&gt;&gt; It's too demoralizing to sell something
for 40 bucks a month. You're like, "All
right, two 200 more of these,"
&gt;&gt; right? It's tough versus like, you know,
the garage cleanout guy, like if he's
charging
&gt;&gt; 700 bucks. It's like,
&gt;&gt; all right, he needs to do one garage
clean out a day and he's making Yeah,
he's chilling. He's making 21,
&gt;&gt; right?
&gt;&gt; I'm on the pod.
&gt;&gt; Let's go. That's awesome. And it's like
anyone can go and do that. Like
literally, I could wake up tomorrow and
be like, "Dude, f everything that I'm
doing." Like I'm just gonna clean
garages out for four hours a day and
like vibe. Like I'm gonna make my money.
I'm gonna like I'll work for four hours
in the garage. I'll answer emails and do
lead genen activities for an hour or two
hours. Like you're working six hours a
day. You're making 20,000 bucks a month.
It's like very simple living. And you

[09:00]
It's like very simple living. And you
have the option to go and expand that.
Sure. Like hey my
&gt;&gt; go hire people.
&gt;&gt; My cousin wants to get in on this. he
hates his job. Like, I'll pay him
$400 a garage clean out whenever I have
overages and like, right, like stair
step your way up. And I think people
just like really get caught in this like
I want to build a SAS or like
&gt;&gt; one of these things because there's way
more upside obviously if you're going to
go through the pain of entrepreneurship.
It's really easy to try to to like
create this reward for yourself, which
is like multi-million dollar cars and
yachts and houses. And I was super
guilty of that of like this sucks and so
like I need to put a Lamborghini on the
finish line here to like help me get
through the pain of it. But it's also
like you could also just go make a quart
million dollars in any location that has
like a reasonable population on little
stuff like that.
&gt;&gt; That garage business is recurring, too,
because that garage ain't going to stay
clean forever.
&gt;&gt; Like a yearly spring cleanout,
&gt;&gt; literally. Dude, let me uh Can I Can we

[10:01]
&gt;&gt; literally. Dude, let me uh Can I Can we
do the word generator again?
&gt;&gt; 100%.
&gt;&gt; Let's add a little variable. Okay.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Let's do this. So, let's uh I'm going to
share my screen. I'm going to go to
random word generator.com,
which is a great like
&gt;&gt; phenomenal.
&gt;&gt; It's a great.com because they made it a
great, right? Most people would look at
that and they're like, "Oh, three words,
15,
&gt;&gt; 15 letters. Like,
&gt;&gt; how are you going to monetize that?"
Well, he is. He's doing great.
&gt;&gt; Let's do this. Let's both come up with
an idea. It doesn't have to be first to
the idea wins. Let's both come up with
an idea. And then I'm going to open uh
Claude, Chad, whatever. And I'm going to
give [clears throat] it no context and
say objectively which idea is better and
why. Okay.
&gt;&gt; All three of these.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we you have to incorporate each of
those three words.
&gt;&gt; All right, let's try it.
&gt;&gt; Okay, here we go. And we are not going
to edit this. We're not going to remove
the time. Okay,
&gt;&gt; that's fine.
&gt;&gt; You just have to trust us.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; All right. You ready? You watching?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm ready. You got that latency
delay. I got a 0.2 second uh edge on you

[11:01]
delay. I got a 0.2 second uh edge on you
here.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm ready to go.
&gt;&gt; All right, here we go. Philosophy,
acceptable, steel. Oh, man.
&gt;&gt; Steel's tough, dude. I could have
definitely gone deep on on philosophy
acceptable all the way through.
&gt;&gt; Acceptable. All right, I got an idea.
&gt;&gt; Go.
&gt;&gt; Um, it's going to be like a a community
kind of like Ryan Holidayiday's Stoics
community, right? of like bluecollar
where I was going 34 year old dudes that
work in steel manufacturing whatever and
it's
&gt;&gt; it's going to be like around philosophy.
It's going to be like Marcus Aurelius
like Socrates all that.
&gt;&gt; It's going to be dudes like us that
wouldn't normally care about philosophy
but that do. It's going to be a
community just like this the stoicism
community and now acceptable. How do you
work acceptable into it? That's how
society views these guys. That's the
chip on your shoulder marketing angle
where it's like [laughter] no one
respects you.
&gt;&gt; The world thinks you're an idiot.

[12:00]
&gt;&gt; The world thinks you're an idiot.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh, what what's the adjective for
you? Joe Blow working in a steel mill in
Philadelphia. Acceptable. Yeah, Joe's
acceptable. No. No. Joe knows Socrates.
Joe's stoic.
&gt;&gt; Joe is more refined than acceptable.
He's better than acceptable. For $79 a
month, you can join another community.
You can join this community of other
quote unquote acceptable and that will
be like the t-shirt.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Acceptable like a kind of like a
oxymoron or like a Yeah. Or like I don't
know.
&gt;&gt; What do you think?
&gt;&gt; I'm not going to be able to beat that.
&gt;&gt; You know, come on.
&gt;&gt; Like well the
&gt;&gt; the moment you started talking I was
like oh yeah that's that's where we're
rolling.
I was like
&gt;&gt; then you stop thinking for yourself
right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah 100%. Yeah that's the that's like
the one that makes the most sense here.
Objectively, you're better at this than
me. The third word makes it hard, dude.
And maybe maybe I'm saying that as a
copout, but like
&gt;&gt; the third is like, dude, philosophy and

[13:00]
&gt;&gt; the third is like, dude, philosophy and
acceptable. I'm in.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Steel.
&gt;&gt; Let's
&gt;&gt; I'm also in such an ebook brain that I'm
like, I should write a book about it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Like, why not?
&gt;&gt; Just write a book.
&gt;&gt; Like,
&gt;&gt; yeah. Bluecollar Stoics.
&gt;&gt; How to find peace
&gt;&gt; in your bluecollar career.
&gt;&gt; I like that.
&gt;&gt; How to find meaning
&gt;&gt; while you're
&gt;&gt; stringing railroads or whatever, you
know, like whatever they're doing.
[laughter] I don't know.
&gt;&gt; We don't know what we're talking about.
&gt;&gt; No idea.
&gt;&gt; But we I don't know anything about
divorce and I could still make money on
it. So like, hey,
&gt;&gt; that's right.
&gt;&gt; Like I bet you I could sell blue collar
stuff. I fixed thousands of iPhones and
I hated every single one of them.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; But that's okay.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But you know what, dude?
&gt;&gt; Oh, dude.
&gt;&gt; I accept you.
&gt;&gt; Oh, thank you.
&gt;&gt; I accept you.
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
&gt;&gt; You know, that's an acceptable.
&gt;&gt; You are enough.
&gt;&gt; You are. That's Dude, there's a couple
of signs around here. Billboards. You
are enough. That's what they say.

[14:00]
are enough. That's what they say.
&gt;&gt; LA,
&gt;&gt; you know, dude, we're all about that
mental health.
&gt;&gt; You know what, Sam? I reject that notion
that you are enough. Okay, I'm going to
take the opposite side of that. You're
not enough. You're not there yet. I'm
not enough. You're not enough. We're
still working on it. We're a work in
progress. Get me a t-shirt that says you
are enough with a line through it that
says work in progress. How about that?
&gt;&gt; Love.
&gt;&gt; Never done.
&gt;&gt; And you're accepted at the same time.
That's the nuance. We love you how you
are, but that doesn't lead to
complacency.
&gt;&gt; Here is a quick tried and true business
idea for you. There is an all-in-one
platform that handles CRM, email
marketing, funnels, booking, all of it.
Everything a business needs to run and
grow. It's called High Level, but you
can completely white label your own
tools with it, which means you can
rebrand the entire thing as your own
software and sell it to local
businesses. It's got a built-in
prospecting tool that pulls local
businesses, shows exactly where they're
screwing up, and then you can pitch them
the fix. Find the problem and solve the
problem on the same platform. It's

[15:00]
problem on the same platform. It's
stupid easy to set up. It has drag and
drop builders, pre-built templates for
everything, so you're not just starting
from scratch. Then you can charge
monthly. They get their problem solved
while you build recurring revenue. So go
to gohighlevel.comtkopod
for your first 30 days free and this
could legitimately be your next
business,
&gt;&gt; dude. Like just like one of the the
leaders in my church said, he says,
"Come as you are, but don't expect to
stay as you are."
&gt;&gt; Yes. Love. How
&gt;&gt; about that?
&gt;&gt; Love. Love. That's sick to write a book.
&gt;&gt; He has. He has.
&gt;&gt; That's awesome.
&gt;&gt; Any other like fun growth hacks or crazy
stories? any hummingbirds, dude. Our
your hummingbird video, it's got 240,000
views, dude.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's great, dude. It's cuz I broke
down what? Like, it's selling sugar,
dude. Like, it's not
&gt;&gt; How many conversations have you and I
had like that? That's just another
Tuesday.
&gt;&gt; It's funny. I'll talk to people and
they'll be like, "I saw you on the
kernel." I was like, "Dude, you should
see our text threads." I like like these
pods started just because we would sit
in the office and talk this exact same

[16:01]
in the office and talk this exact same
way. Like, there was no They're like,
"Do you guys plan it?" No. Like,
&gt;&gt; no. This episode, full transparency, was
the most planned thing ever. And it was
literally Yeah, I was gonna say it was
&gt;&gt; three minutes before it started.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I was like, "What are we talking
about?" Oh, this cool, which I don't
know if you've done a great job of
holding to by the way, but if the
thumbnail works,
&gt;&gt; fix that in post. Fix it in post.
&gt;&gt; So funny.
&gt;&gt; I've been thinking more about that macro
trend. Like I think getting people to
take action, lower the bar of success,
make things simple and just doing it I
think is is a win. Like it's the moment
you make your first dollar for yourself,
you will feel it here. So don't delay
that anymore. You could go sell
something on Facebook Marketplace and be
like, "Wait a second. I just flipped
this thing that spent I spent $100 on
and I sold it for 140."
&gt;&gt; And you just start to like rewire that
side of it. And then the other piece of
it, which is funny, it's like I tell

[17:01]
it, which is funny, it's like I tell
people like we'll talk and it's you get
paid for shiny object syndrome, right?
Like you get paid to run this show and
talk about all of these like fun new
things and all of it, which is awesome.
And
behind every shiny object to make it
meaningful is an absolute metric bleep
ton of work. And when you hit that work,
don't stop working. Don't switch to the
next shiny object that's fun for that
first two weeks because it'll end up
turning into work if it's working.
Double down. Keep running at it. I think
is more valuable to hear than like
here's how I set up my ad account to
like drop my CPL by 6%. Right? Like most
people don't even get to the spot where
they get to have that conversation. With
that said, shiny object number 72
is uh local local newsletters, dude.
Because of like if you're stuck and

[18:00]
Because of like if you're stuck and
don't know
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; If you don't know what to do right now
and you're like, I want to do something,
&gt;&gt; but I don't know what
&gt;&gt; to sell or whatever.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Start with audience.
&gt;&gt; I tweeted it the other day. I was like,
there's no doubt in my mind that almost
every business on the planet can start
as some form of a media company, whether
that's a blog, a newsletter, a Tik Tok
account, any of those things. So, it's
like if you don't know what to do, I
promise that you can make money in any
industry ever. What do you like?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You love cars.
Cool. Just start talking about cars. Do
a newsletter on cars. Yep. like just
talk about that thing that you love.
Meet people that are also interested in
that thing and then sometime you'll be
like, "Oh my goodness, I just saw an ad
for a a tint shop locally. What if I
sold these leads to tint shops?" And
you'll be like, "Well, I'll run ads for
right like

[19:00]
right like
&gt;&gt; whatever that thing is, right?" Right.
And so it's like if you don't have
something that you feel super passionate
about from a from a business
perspective, if you're like, "Yeah, just
like garage cleaning sounds interesting,
pressure washing sounds interesting,
like anything local, like that's kind of
like as a human where I'd rather be and
like what I'd rather do is work with my
hands and like be hands-on in the
community and all of that." Sweet.
Started a local newsletter. Lauren and I
have ours. We're at 3,200 subs. One,
people hit us up asking for to promote
their stuff, which like I'm not really
trying to monetize it like that, so I'll
just promote them for free. Like if they
hit me up, like this lady was like, "My
cousin runs the dry cleaner. Can you
shout them out?" It's like, "Yeah,
sure." Like we'll do it. But the moment
that I'm like,
&gt;&gt; "You should see all the domains I own
now where I'm like, I own Southbay
carpet cleaning.com. I own
Southbaybookkeeping.com.
I Right." Like a bunch of these things
where I was like, "Wait a second." Like
dude,
&gt;&gt; I could go and turn on anything that I
want on the back of that and it's just
because I have that asset. And I think

[20:01]
because I have that asset. And I think
more people should just start to have an
asset. And that's an so easy, bro. Like
my Tik Toks are literally like,
&gt;&gt; "Are you on Tik Tok?"
&gt;&gt; I started posting Tik Toks on on the
newsletter page like last week. It's got
like a hundred followers. It's super
easy. It's B-roll of the ocean and me
being like the 10 best bars in Hermosa
and it's just like listing them out. So
I got 100 followers. It's like and I'm
getting follows from all the
restaurants, right? Like there's
realtors that are following and like all
of a sudden Yeah. All of a sudden you're
like, "Wait a second." Like there's
movement. There's progress. There's like
you're starting to feel that. And it's
building this asset that you can use to
go launch literally anything. Like And
I've had that thought. I was like, "What
are the cheapest things? I can go buy a
pressure washer. Why would I not go
promote that?" Like, and just see,
&gt;&gt; let me get this idea out. You gave me an
idea.
&gt;&gt; Go. When you said South Bay carpet
cleaning.com, dude, what are we talking
about? Why doesn't someone go build an
agent that scrapes, not scrapes, but
just looks up every city name in America

[21:01]
just looks up every city name in America
by population and then every home
service industry by commonality and then
looks up, you know, New York City
dentist taken, New York City
chiropractor taken, and just goes down
the the line and starts buying up all
the domain names that are not taken. And
you're gonna find pretty soon you own
Chicago landscaping.com. Who would have
thought that's available? But how many
people have bots that are looking for
that? And then but you're also going to
own like buck Texas, you know, woodf
flooror cleaning.com, which is like
basically worthless. But you could set
up parameters where it's like if it's
over x characters, don't buy it. If it's
over x syllables, don't buy it. If the
city population is under 100,000 people,
don't buy it. Like what are we talking
about? You could sell access to that.
&gt;&gt; I have a handful that I own that are
those.
&gt;&gt; I bet you do. Yeah, I've got a couple
pride and joys, dude. I have hirelos
Angeles.com and hirenew york.com. And so
it would be like job boards for big
geos. I think super interesting idea.
And you just sell the leads is the nice
part. You don't have to go launch it.

[22:00]
part. You don't have to go launch it.
Like I know a guy that has a carpet
cleaning business here. Like the plan is
not for me to go clean dudes carpets.
The plan is for me to be like, "Hey, I
charge this guy 800 bucks. Yo, Jim, I
know you charge 600." Dude, can I tell
you a domain name I have my eye on
that's ridiculously expensive?
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
&gt;&gt; it's for sale as a premium domain
name.com.
250 grand. I offered 150, they said no.
I offered 170, they said no. They
basically said we know what we have.
&gt;&gt; Wow.
&gt;&gt; Tell me that's not a good name. High
ticket course.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; How many AI consultants? And then when I
say consulting, I mean implementation
and automation agencies, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. 100%.
&gt;&gt; Oh, dude.
&gt;&gt; 100%.
&gt;&gt; That's a good one. It's just built in.
It's just built in. It's just like so
it's just so there.
&gt;&gt; It's relevance. It's title wave.
&gt;&gt; It's the same with pay per call, right?
I was like, payer call.io. Like this is
what we do. It's straight up and it's
like it's a win, dude. It's a hedge on
the future. And that's what it's going

[23:00]
the future. And that's what it's going
to be. I mean, you see, what's that
dude's name from? He was like Morning
Brew or whatever. Alex uh Lieberman or
whatever. And it's like
&gt;&gt; McKenzie for AI.
&gt;&gt; That's what he's doing. I'm using one
domain for that divorce thing, but
com is for sale for like 10 grand.
&gt;&gt; That's good. That paid for itself in one
lead. I mean, it could
&gt;&gt; I know
&gt;&gt; that's international lawyers was 10
grand.
&gt;&gt; Yep. It's just
&gt;&gt; there's so much opportunity out there.
&gt;&gt; It's Dude, and that's the issue. But
then every single opportunity turns into
a metric fo.
Yeah,
&gt;&gt; like I have seven metric stuns on my
back already.
&gt;&gt; And so it's like
&gt;&gt; somebody should do it.
&gt;&gt; It's always my somebody should do it.
&gt;&gt; Go make someone will.
&gt;&gt; It's a matter of
&gt;&gt; go someone go make your 20 grand a
month, dude. I promise you can.
&gt;&gt; Dude, let's close it out with this.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; I want to do one more random word

[24:00]
&gt;&gt; I want to do one more random word
generator.
&gt;&gt; I knew Dude, I knew you were about to do
that and I was like, dude, another one
of these things showing off at this
point. No, no, no, no. I I want to
change it, so I'm not. Quick question.

or less.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; Okay. And we're not going to say a word
for 30 seconds. Okay.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; You ready? So I can't we can't ruin it.
I'm going to click it right now.
&gt;&gt; I don't have a timer, but yeah.
&gt;&gt; I got I'm going to switch over to a
timer screen.

[25:00]
timer screen.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; All right. Here we go. Lounge full play.
I got an idea.
&gt;&gt; I feel like we're thinking like the same
thing.
&gt;&gt; There's only one way to find out.
&gt;&gt; Should we stop it early? I mean, seven
seconds.
&gt;&gt; I got I've got mine. Like I know I know
what I'm launching, dude. I'm launching
a nightclub
&gt;&gt; specific marketing agency.
&gt;&gt; Full lounge, baby.
&gt;&gt; Your full lounge. We're making sure the
whole thing full.
&gt;&gt; That's good.
&gt;&gt; Full lounge. Ooh, that's the So, dude,
sometimes the idea is the name, right?
This is a perfect example. Like, you're
not we're not reinventing the wheel.
This is a marketing agency. There's a
million of them out there, but the name
makes the idea.
&gt;&gt; That is what unlimited content was. I
saw that domain for sale and I was like,
dude, an SEO agency that's super focused
on the content side. And then we bought
it and launched it and here we are.
&gt;&gt; It is the name, dude.
&gt;&gt; Your idea wins. Your idea. Your idea
wins. So, [laughter]
my idea is not even thought out yet, but

[26:02]
my idea is not even thought out yet, but
I was [clears throat] thinking of
airport lounges. Like an airport lounge,
an app or a directory where you could
like cuz sometimes lounges are full.
Like airport lounges are full. I've got
a card. I've got access and it's full,
right? So maybe it's like it only shows
you ones that are not full or it's like
a
&gt;&gt; so that you don't leave to go to the
airport two hours early so you can sit
in the lounge if you can't get in
anyways. Or maybe because there's all
kind like there's American Airlines,
there's Delta, there's like non
airlineowned lounges, maybe it
aggregates all of them and for like a
ridiculous price. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Maybe like pay per access instead of
like a monthly fee instead of having to
have an AMX Platinum or whatever. It's
just like a
&gt;&gt; I feel like there is an app similar to
that.
&gt;&gt; It's kind of like I had a canceled
flight. I got seven hours in this
airport. I will pay $200 to chill in a
lounge.
&gt;&gt; I did at the American Airlines one. I
spent eight hours in one and the
admirals
&gt;&gt; and I was like, "Thank god they had a
shower, dude.
&gt;&gt; Let's prompt this out." Okay, I'm going

[27:00]
&gt;&gt; Let's prompt this out." Okay, I'm going
to log into Claude cuz it it doesn't
know me as well as Chad GPT. I don't
want it to be biased.
&gt;&gt; Come on. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I mean, I'm not going to tell it who's
in the game, dude.
&gt;&gt; I know, right? Hold on. I'm logging in.
I just refreshed my cash. So, all right.
I'm going to share my screen. Okay. And
you're going to approve this prompt
before I hit enter. I'm telling you
right now, I'm hedging my bets. Your
idea is better.
&gt;&gt; Here's what Claude thinks.
&gt;&gt; I agree. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; Grade these two biz ideas from 1 to 10.
Okay. One, an app that allows you to buy
one-time access to airport lounges.
Two, a marketing agency that specializes
in bars and nightclubs.
Yeah.
And keeping them full and busy and the
unique selling proposal of the agency

[28:03]
unique selling proposal of the agency
is the name. What was it? Full lounge.
&gt;&gt; Full lounge.
&gt;&gt; Full lounge as in full lounge.com. Could
I prompt that any differently?
&gt;&gt; No, you're chilling. I kind of feel like
it's going to vote for me because it's
going to think that mine's more unique.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. Well, and that's that's
what I was about to say is like what's
the parameter, right? So, like
&gt;&gt; based on it being likely to work like
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm down with that. So, you have a
success parameter, you have a speed to
cash flow parameter, you have an ease of
marketing or like cost of acquisition
parameter, right? There's all these
variables to consider, but like you
could have a much bigger business on one
on yours, right? But like it would cost
you a lot
&gt;&gt; and you'd have to spend a lot of money
on marketing and partnerships with all
the lounge. Like it would be hard,
&gt;&gt; right? But like you could make it huge
or you could just go stack 20 grand a

[29:00]
or you could just go stack 20 grand a
month like with 20
restaurant nightclub
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; clients that pay you a,000 bucks a
month. So grade these two business ideas
from 1 to 10 based on which is most
likely to get to profitability fast for
the lowest relative amount of time,
money, and effort. That good?
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; All right. All right, Claude, what you
got for us?
&gt;&gt; Analyzing airport lounge app market
saturization.
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. Here you go.
&gt;&gt; Oh, it's called Lounge Buddy. Lounge
Buddy, dude. Lounge.
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's a thing.
&gt;&gt; Lounge Buddy, dude. That's the app that
I was thinking of. It's Lounge Buddy.
&gt;&gt; You win. You win. Look at this. I get a
three out of 10. You get an eight out of
10.
&gt;&gt; Dang it.
&gt;&gt; You can start today with a laptop and a
phone. First client immediate
profitability. Bars desperately need
foot traffic. Can improve improve ROI.
Domain name is clever and memorable
marketing. Niche specialization makes
you expert versus generalist agencies.
Can land first client in one to two
weeks if you hustle.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; And mine just says significant
upbringing capital partnerships

[30:00]
upbringing capital partnerships
extremely competitive. Long sales cycle,
which all those are
&gt;&gt; low margin. All of it.
&gt;&gt; Dude, that was fun. That's Hey,
Muhammad, since I lost this one, edit
this last one out.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, right, dude.
