[00:00]
that ski resort had a webcam up on their
snow tubing their whole season and so
the so you can guess where I'm going
with it the season before I literally
just sat there with a clicker I've got
it somewhere I need to find it and it's
pretty easy to figure out how successful
something like that
[Music]
is welcome to the ker office I think
you're going to love this one why
because you love the last time I
interviewed Matthew SS he was the guy
that started the Alpine Slide business
episode 20 P9 to be exact we had a
follow-up episode because we just
couldn't get it all out so he talked all
about his business Pigeon Forge snow and
the subdivision that he's putting in and
other random business ideas he's a cool
guy I think you're going to like it
please like subscribe and share with
your friends thank you when we last left
off you have mentioned Pigeon Forge snow
but we didn't really get into what made
you think to start that what did you see
that triggered that idea what was the
startup process like funding it like
first month first year I want to hear

[01:01]
first month first year I want to hear
the Pigeon Forge snow story because it's
such a unique business yeah so that's a
lot of questions right there I guess to
give somebody a recap uh so pigeon for
snow is a indoor snow park it's mainly
uh snow tubing and it is actually the
first it was the first of its kind in
the US and so what I mean by that is it
is actually first off it's temperature
independent which means that um it is
not Subzero so it's call it 65 to 70
Dees in the building at all times maybe
sometimes people reference one in maybe
Dubai or or whatever and those are
Subzero you you got to wear jackets or
or be really cold so so there's one and
then the second thing is sometimes
there's some snow Parks but um they're
not open year long and uh yeah ours is
year-long indoor temperature independent
snow park so big word there I created
this indoor snow park and a lot of
people ask like how did I come up with
that and as much as I would love to say
that it was is my idea actually took

[02:01]
that it was is my idea actually took
inspiration from another business about
30 or 45 minutes away there's a ski
resort an outdoor ski resort and they
have snow tubing every year from
Thanksgiving to to Easter they guarantee
it and so I was like how is that
possible sometimes it's 70° sometimes
it's raining all that kind of stuff and
so what I found out was they use these
machines that basically make the snow
inside these giant containers and then
they they spit it out and they basically
pile up snow all year long so people can
snow tube and that really from the
outside looking in is a critical part to
their business because they can
guarantee that so my next question was
okay if they can do that can I just
build a building and control the
temperature control the conditions and
blow snow just like them and the answer
was yes and once we enclosed the
building we had to overcome other
factors what do we do with all the Melt
and I one thing that I learned very Qui
quickly is water is Snow's enemy and if

[03:03]
quickly is water is Snow's enemy and if
you have a glass and you put an ice cube
in it and the Ice Cube starts melting
it'll melt even faster when there's
water accumulating and so anyway so we
have to get rid of the Melt as quickly
as we can and so under the snow we
designed this water capture system where
we're basically we're getting the water
away from the snow as quickly as
possible the other thing is there is
water in the air and there's water on
top of the snow and so it's like okay
how do we suck it out of the air suck it
out of the snow and that's a technical
term right yes exactly we have giant
dehumidification systems that you might
see in like ice skating rinks or or
whatever and so we're pulling all that
water out of the air and what I think is
really cool is uh it's gallons and
gallons and gallons and gallons but we
actually recycle it and we use it for
snow um you know the next night or
whatever and so anyways by controlling
the temperature and condition

[04:00]
the temperature and condition
we're able to offer snow 365 24/7 in a
controlled environment and it was like
testing a theory with those machines and
it worked and yeah I'm big fan of
testing things if you want to I can test
how or I can tell you how I even tested
if there was demand for this yeah I want
to hear all that two questions that come
to mind as you talk first of all how
when you saw the ski resort 30 minutes
away and that was your inspiration How
Deeply did you go in like competitive
Intel did you camp out there did you
talk to the manager I've done both right
I've literally camped outside a store
and counted people walking in and out
like average order value $12 okay and
then I've Al also been like that's a
good idea I'm copying it and then that's
it that's all my research yeah so so
Chris I think you can I think you're an
honest guy and you will attest to this
was not a pre-planned question so the
answer to that was that ski resort had a
webcam up on their snow tubing their
whole season and so the so you can guess
I'm going with it the the season before

[05:02]
I'm going with it the the season before
I literally just sat there with a
clicker I've got it somewhere I need to
find it and it's pretty easy to figure
out how successful something like that
is on top of that you could only buy
those tickets online and they had X
number per per slot per day and on their
website when you went to buy a ticket
it' say I don't know 40 out of 150 or
whatever and so they made it so easy for
you they were begging you to copy them
no it was insane and so yeah somewhere I
need to find it somewhere I've got those
notes and it's like I know probably down
to $100 what they did in that season and
so yeah as I was planning it I just
counted that each day like as I was
eating dinner or whatever I'm sitting
there just counting had other people
counting for me too and yeah and and
then even after a week or two you you
get a pretty good idea of okay are they
busy during the mornings or the evenings
or whatever and yes I so for me at the
time and still is snow was a huge huge

[06:00]
time and still is snow was a huge huge
financial death and uh I was not going
to risk uh my life uh in terms of uh
being being set financially and this and
that and just my my peace of mind for
something that I wasn't sure that was
going to work and so yeah I found every
which way to test it I'm calling up
potential customers this and that I had
to make 100% sure that this thing is
going to work and I got to a point that
I was confident enough that it was and
yeah it was through being a little bit
creative in seeing some other people's
success or or failures and and keeping
track of that oh man I want to do a
whole podcast series you could do a
whole podcast period about just how to
copy potential compe how to quote draw
inspiration like man it it reminds me of
e-commerce I come from the e-commerce
world and it's so easy to reverse
engineer how much business store does
you just you place an order you see the
order number 24 hours later you place
another order you subtract you multiply

[07:00]
another order you subtract you multiply
by 365 you account for seasonality and
then you figure out their average order
value and now you know how much any
e-commerce store in the world does and
then you can just I'm so cheap I don't
even take delivery of the orders I just
cancel them like never mind that's so
funny I got what I needed I uh you know
we talked last time about the coaster
that I built and that there was a
competitor doing that first and I think
they actually changed their ticketing
like receipt numbers because of me
because yeah I just do that every day it
was like 001 002 and anyways yeah
there's a lot of that and there's things
that you'll hear other people doing that
I would have never even thought of
obviously you've got the classics like
if it's a retail business you sit
outside and count cars I think we've all
been there to some extent and yeah
there's a lot of things you can do I
think that would be great inspiration
for some people to have yeah you could
ramble probably for hours about
different ways to test ideas yeah I
think that there's a common
misconception with entrepreneurs that
we're Risk Takers yeah and I I feel like
we are experts at mitigating risk like

[08:00]
we are experts at mitigating risk like
more than a W2 worker like we do so much
research because I've been there I've
never launched anything that was that
off-the-wall and risky I but it's like
this can't fail we're talking seven
figures here yeah this cannot fail and
so I'm guessing what you did was you got
their numbers and I want to hear what
their numbers were and then they were
you said they were like 30 40 minutes
away if it was ski resort it can't be in
the middle of Pigeon Forge right so
you're thinking okay it's only upside
I'm going to put this in the middle of
pigeon Forge I've been to your facility
uh I know it's tuck back off the main
road but it's like it's more convenient
it's more temperature controlled I don't
care about the rain in fact the rain
could actually help me this worst case I
do half of what they do and I make a
$500,000 profit best case I do three
times what they do right yeah yeah and
so one thing that I usually get on to
people about wasting too much time on is
creating Prof formas and budgets and
stuff cuz usually they never come true
but y I spend a lot of time on mine and

[09:02]
but y I spend a lot of time on mine and
I can safely say I am so proud of that
because it was so freaking accurate at
the end I'm calling the electric company
and trying to calculate like how much
electricity I'm going to use this and
that and then in terms of demand you
hinted at it some people say okay if I
best case scenario I have 100 customers
a day and blah blah blah blah blah okay
I want to know what is the least amount
of customers I can have and still make
this work and I worked backwards and
said okay if this thing is a flop what
does that look like and I was still
happy with those results and then yeah
it's it's something that a lot of people
cheap out with some of their budget
stuff and it's like why would you
underestimate some of that stuff every
single Prof fora or budget I've ever put
together you have this miscellaneous at
the bottom and for me that's usually
just sum of everything plus 20% or 15%
or whatever cuz you're going to miss
stuff and it's about testing it's about

[10:00]
stuff and it's about testing it's about
working those numbers I will for next
time I will go and look and see what the
ski resort did it was something that the
ski resort Ober they are open from
Thanksgiving to Easter typically so I've
got a whole season or or actually three
seasons that they are not open and so
that should be a win the other thing was
that that ski resort during the popular
times during the winter they were
selling out like I went on I'm sure so
who knows what their who knows what
their Tam was right oh of course it's
something that if you go on like local
Facebook groups or anything like that
they were a little bit more popular when
I was doing that but it's like people
were like selling snow toing tickets
like black market whatever and yeah you
that's always a good sign yeah and so
anyways I got really comfortable with
the numbers both in terms of Revenue and
potential cost I was still nervous of
course but believe it or not that was
the least of my worries I just got so
comfortable with it do you remember what
they were doing
ballpark yeah I mean it was definitely I

[11:01]
ballpark yeah I mean it was definitely I
I mean don't quote me on this but it was
in the millions an amazing thing too is
every year they would raise their ticket
price so it was something like maybe
like
$25 plus taxes and fees and blah blah
blah the first year then it was 30 then
they went to Dynamic pricing I think
last year I love these guys all my
trigger words I know I know and so I
think they were at like 45 or 50 last
year
and yeah it's a classic like supply and
demand issue where they've got more
demand than Supply so yeah good on them
so you want you just wanted to help them
with that exactly uh they I I don't
think they particularly liked me at
first but we've come around and yeah
they're doing great I'm doing great and
yeah I mean I don't want anyone else to
open up one but there' probably be room
for another one yeah that's just just
like your coaster story you you just
grow the market when there's so much
demand for something yeah you just the
it's a rising tide situation exactly um

[12:02]
it's a rising tide situation exactly um
my next question revolved around like
your water capture system like yeah I've
talked to a lot of entrepreneurs and
sometimes they come up with this
Innovative method sometimes like they're
actually having to beat their head
against the wall and invent an
Innovative method and because that's the
only way and a lot of times it's just
like they outsourced it or or it's very
simple right like it's like water
capture system I I installed rain
gutters right I went to Home Depot I
bought gutters and put them underneath
the sides of the slide how extensive was
that so that was something that I knew
we had to have cuz you just go broke if
you had to be on City Water the whole
time and I have said it a lot lately I
don't know if you resonate with this or
not but a lot of times I jump out of the
plane holding the parachute and I try to
put it on in the air don't recommend
that for others but for me that's how it
works and so really like if you go back
and look at our blueprints we were
building and for the water recycling
system there was just a big question
mark on the blueprints and it's like
okay we we'll figure it

[13:00]
okay we we'll figure it
out the reason I was okay just figuring
it out was it couldn't be that
complicated basically at the end of the
day what it is this the snow is on this
hill and obviously through gravity as it
melts it's going to go downhill and we
have a huge collection tank under under
the under the hill and then from there
we have a series of pumps like you could
buy locally and they take them to
different tanks and when it's something
that it's actually on paper it's a
pretty simple system obviously it took
some engineering and there there's no
worse day than when I get the call in
the morning that the pump is broken
water everywhere but that happens a
couple times a year I'm a big redundancy
guy so now we have three pumps
everywhere but but yeah it was something
that I knew that was a critical element
through this whole thing I had to have
Architects Engineers blah blah blah even
just from a legal standpoint but it was
something that one of my favorite
processes was was sitting down working

[14:00]
processes was was sitting down working
with them and you just start spitballing
ideas and you say hey we need a
recycling system and somebody throws out
this idea or that idea and you just work
through it together um or at least we
did and so yeah it was something that
was actually believe it or not like one
of the very last things we figured out
we just knew we would and no one ever
really stressed about it it's funny how
I I imagine you encountered this in both
of your businesses a few times where
it's like you talk to some expert quote
unquote expert and you're like all right
I need to capture and recycle this water
and they're just we can't do that that's
not a thing you dude like I I have
employees tell me this on a weekly basis
where it's like hey we need to fix this
marketing funnel so people get a text
twice and and like yeah it doesn't it
actually doesn't work like that it's
like dude stop yeah we got Rovers on
Mars like we've got we what is actually
impossible today it's not an an
automation for SMS it's not what
recycling water and you always figure it
out you figure it out man I we are cut
from the same cloth I mean I get so even

[15:02]
from the same cloth I mean I get so even
sometimes personally frustrated and like
I have to take a step back like when
people say no it frustrates me but when
people say I can't do something that
really frustrates me and yeah people are
so comfortable saying no or it can't
work or whatever it's like that's what
they gravitate towards first and even
sometimes when I quote do the impossible
even if it's something simple like it's
just like okay on to the next reason why
it won't work on to the next reason and
it's like man and you know a funny story
about experts one of the I think maybe
the first person expert I hired in this
was found out there was a guy that's
what he specializes in terms of like
friction coefficients of like snow and
ice and snow tubing Hills and all this
kind of stuff so it's like perfect
awesome you're hired and this is how
long we are going to make the hill we
need to figure out where are these
people going to stop these are the two
were using blah blah blah this is what

[16:00]
were using blah blah blah this is what
you do and so I got this fancy report
and it's like okay you know all all this
engineering speak it's like great okay
he knows what he's doing I guess and it
was nowhere close it was absolutely
nowhere close and yeah it was terrible
because if you think about it there's
way too many variables like temperature
and water and blah blah hum and yeah and
you know how we did it we as soon as we
could blow snow in the building we blew
a bunch of snow I had some friends and
family and whoever come over one night
we all took turns going down the hill
saw where we stopped we loaded up with
sandbags and this and that and just
experimented and thankfully we had some
room there to play it wasn't a mission
critical kind of equation sometimes for
me at least I think playing around
yourself and experimenting and seeing
what you can find out is often times way
better than hiring an expert regardless
how much they cost okay I I've got so
many thoughts here okay first of all I
gotta get this out of my head so the

[17:01]
gotta get this out of my head so the
water recapture the gravity does its job
you you accumulate water on the slide
gravity pushes down to the bottom falls
through a metal grate ends up in a tank
pumps it up to a different tank and then
the snow system needs an intake of water
and instead of just using your city
water it's just pulling from the
Recycled water right nailed it nailed it
love it okay second I I have to imagine
that the whole time you're doing this
you're meeting with experts you're
investing a ton of money like you're
past the p have no return if I were you
the big question mark in my mind is will
this be fun enough yeah right was that a
worry like that first trip down the
slide must have been must have felt
amazing when you got down it because
that's the big question right yeah yeah
of course you're right that was a huge
worry obviously I tested that in a lot
of ways one thing is I I think sometimes
you know you can make up for a lot of
mistakes through price and so it's like
okay if I'm totally wrong what if it's

[18:01]
okay if I'm totally wrong what if it's
$5 or what if you know whatever can I
make it out and yeah I agree so one of
the things was and this was one of the
reasons I hired the expert was you want
you want to go fast enough that it's
exciting and then you want to go slow
enough that kids and whoever can do it
and I'll be the first to admit I think
we got a little Lucky in that regard we
ended up kind of clocking in around 30 m
an hour and if it was faster than that
probably too scary for some and if it's
slower than that yeah it's going to get
lame and so yeah that was a huge worry
up until the very first day I himself
admittedly I have very thin skin in
terms of like I could take critic I
don't take criticism that sometimes and
so it's like the first yeah the first
couple people that had like a negative
review or something was like oh my gosh
it's over oh my gosh screw you yeah yeah
and so it's just yeah and and uh but but
anyways like then for every positive one
it started to outweigh all the negative

[19:01]
it started to outweigh all the negative
ones and anyways yes I think we got a
little lucky there I always knew in my
back pocket that if we didn't a we can
physically change some stuff and then B
we can add and do more exciting things
I've left it the same more or less
mainly because it works there's a part
of me that I feel like I should make
time to add some more exciting elements
to it I've got some really out there
ideas but it's man I'm just focused on
whatever else and just never have that
day when it's like okay let's figure out
how to step this up but it's definitely
needed sometime soon yeah one thing that
I love about launching businesses in
areas like Pigeon Forge which this is
going to directly contradict what I said
in our last episode 29 in our last
episode I was saying like you need to
put something like this not you but
someone should put something like this
in Dallas like gem mining in Dallas or
an Alpine Slide in Dallas because
there's n million people baked in and
they're getting visitors right yeah but
I think the counterargument to that is

[20:00]
I think the counterargument to that is
you have a fresh crop of people every
year aren't there like 10 million people
a year coming to more it yeah it's wild
I would love to know what percentage of
them are there for the first time first
repeat visitors yeah it's something that
I grew up there my grandparents are from
there and I have a unique Insight of
watching the demographics change over
the years it used to really skew much
older and that is changing more and more
and I I think that works to to our f
yes I would love to know repeat versus
first time but but yeah I think even
Millennials and even younger start to
come in that's going to be better and
better for us you spoke about doing it
in Dallas or whatever and I've got an
idea that yeah if somebody wants help
with I mean not financially but just
knowledge I am a believer that you could
do this somewhere like Dallas but you
don't have to invest millions and so how
you would do that is they make those
snow the snow machines that I have on

[21:00]
snow the snow machines that I have on
mobile units so mobile is a loose word
you've got a tractor trailer basically
but you can move it around and believe
it or not you just have to have access
to just reasonable water like a little
bit more than garden hose but not too
much more and three-phase power the
three power does get a little hairy but
there there's ways around that anyways I
have thought about sometimes what if you
went to called Dallas or I'm in
Knoxville the local mall or wherever
that that's not using a large part of
their parking
lot whether you just have snow just on
flat ground that people can play with or
you've got you know that you build a
hill out of kind of plywood and stuff it
doesn't or even out of snow it doesn't
take much obviously you would have to
work out some kind of lease or rev share
but potentially that comes down to how
much you can you know work out the snow
machine you can rent for a month or
whatever test the model before buying it
yeah totally and or even just make it
seasonal and say I'm going to rent it
every November December January and um

[22:03]
every November December January and um
and so anyways yes it would take a
little bit of capital but not what
people probably have in their head um
insurance is not as crazy I mean you
have to find somebody that's on board
with what you're doing but not as crazy
and then past that you just need some
you need a handful of people just I
won't say minimum wage but whatever the
the going rate is and you know past that
it's some water and some electricity
yeah so that if it were out out side it
would have to be seasonal right correct
yeah okay okay and that's honestly so
even for us our best season is basically
Thanksgiving to you know sometime in
January uh we will do maybe about a
third of our total revenue for the year
and that call it 60-day
period people are just in the mindset
you don't think to go sledding in July
even if it would be really nice to get
out of the heat you just don't totally
totally I don't know I was going to say
you don't drink eggnog during the summer
but that's also because they don't sell

[23:00]
but that's also because they don't sell
it but there's certain but you still
wouldn't yeah and that's why they don't
sell it during the summer it's because
no one wants to do that so so yeah
there's just something that triggers I
guess and take it as far as you want get
Santa Claus there whatever it is there's
a lot you can do and I'm serious with
that like if somebody needs some
guidance or or wants some one on that I
think it would totally work I can't
guarantee it but happy to help somebody
okay awesome yeah well email them after
you um yeah if if you have a question so
I I like the idea of did you hear my
podcast a couple ago where I had it was
my call-in show and this guy had the
flow riter idea yeah yeah you could put
one something like that in a mall
parking lot and just like it sounds
awkward like parking spaces around this
fake surfing structure but why the heck
not so With the Flow Rider thing one
thing so I've only been familiar with
him like on cruises or things like that
same and something like that I call a
spectator activity like one person is
doing it but like the mining watching

[24:00]
doing it but like the mining watching
yes yes and like I I I talk about this
figurative like Grandma all the time and
you want something that Grandma and the
parents and the little brothers and
sisters can all stand around and watch
somebody do it it's something that I I I
think you've got to rope in the whole
family with something like that you got
to have pictures whether the customers
take them or you professionally do it
and it's a memory for everybody even if
somebody's not participating in it so
love that you say it's awward in a
parking lot like sure but you can dress
that up the other thing is like people
love crowds if there's a crowd of people
standing around watching something
you're going to go check that out and
even if you were giving away I don't
know free Popsicles or something get the
people over there and and then I think
it takes care of itself I love the
pictures idea or a video like you could
just have a GoPro running 247 and it's
like hey all right let's go to check out
it's 15 bucks it's 25 bucks if you want
us to email you the video SL pictures
later and we'll send it in 24 hours
what if you did this I think the

[25:00]
what if you did this I think the
downside with it being a mall parking
lot is I think this could be a very
spontaneous impulsive thing and if you
don't have your swimsuit you're not
going to buy it true right yeah and so
maybe you just go to all the hundreds of
small the midsize water parks I mean in
DFW there's dozens that you never no one
has ever heard of and they don't have
these and they're not about to put one
in so just say hey we need 400 square F
feet somewhere anywhere and maybe you
could even have them upsell like a at
the counter like all right the day pass
is 35 but unlimited Flow Rider access is
45 and you just do a REV share with them
yeah totally it it comes with stuff like
that I think it comes down to your
skills of I won't even say negotiating
but like getting creative where there's
a win for both people and yeah it it is
tough because okay takes snow uh I've
got this big multi-million dollar
facility and yeah I've had people come
and Pitch me hey can I put a vending
machine in here and we'll split it and
it's like hey no offense but I I can
just buy it it's all good and and so

[26:00]
just buy it it's all good and and so
like you know that's a tough sell but
I'm sure there is something that I would
be open to as a business owner one of
the biggest things when you're
approaching business owners like that
with with kind of a deal or whatever is
making sure that you're not giving them
more headaches like you want to take
away headaches and in fact like you just
want to say hey man I can put money in
your pocket and just let me do my thing
and so yeah anyways like partnering with
water parks we only have one or two here
so I can't really speak to that but yeah
if there's a lot somewhere like Dallas
it's like man it wouldn't take that much
to just go talk to everyone or try to
talk to everyone no and you just you get
a contract in place and then you buy the
thing yeah oh yeah totally risk-free
they even make these things and your
guys water parks might have them but
they're these like little boo you can
stand in and dry off pretty quickly it
just blows on you or whatever and like
whether it's a mall parking lot or
whatever like maybe you also have that
and guess what you get to potentially
charge for that too yeah or they have

[27:00]
charge for that too yeah or they have
the sunscreen application booths have
you seen those oh really you just stand
in and you you put your arms out and it
sprays you with sunscreen Ser sounds
like torture to me I mean people pay for
it
so so what was it sorry go ahead now
what's your question what was the first
month and year like for Pigeon Forge
snow and Co aside have you had a down
year just like an natural down year or
is have you just grown every year yeah I
built snow in I I say 365 days it it
might have been a little bit longer but
it was when I say 365 days it was every
single day and so one thing was I was
like okay got to get open got to get
open and when I got open like I then had
that realization it's like oh okay now
it's just starting and I think I had
maybe a month or two of like just
crashing in bed and thankfully I had
some I had a lot of help but it's just
like oh my gosh I I got to take a break
and it was something that you're trying
to figure out all these things on the
Fly and so like the first I'll call it

[28:01]
Fly and so like the first I'll call it
three four five months we're rough in
terms of figuring out what we need to do
and what we need to fix and who we need
to have and hire and blah blah blah
sales-wise it was good I spent those 365
days building a email list getting
people excited how did you build the
email list yeah so so probably our
biggest thing was our Facebook page a
little bit by accident I just started
posting pictures like I when the
bulldozer came in to clear the dirt off
the lot I just took some crappy pictures
on my phone posted said hey getting
started and people L like this is your
personal Facebook account oh no I'm
sorry I created one for snow and and
okay you opened up a page okay yeah and
at the time I I don't think a lot of
people at least in my area were doing
that it's like okay wait until you have
something official and you have
something done but yeah I just let
people fall along in the journey and I
did all kinds of stuff like I created
like these VIP t-shirts with our logo on
it and I can't remember what you got you

[29:01]
it and I can't remember what you got you
know you could come for free you know
the first year so anyways if you bought
one blah blah and so anyways yeah built
up a lot of demand that way and so
anyways we got open it was just even
more work as soon as we got open we had
an initial wave from Grand Opening and
then died down we we opened up in the
spring mid to late spring and we're
going into unbeknownst to me the slower
Time of the Year may that kind of May
period is maybe our slowest month of the
year and so that was a little
disheartening I didn't know and so
anyways it gave us a chance to catch up
our first
year I gonna say we did a couple million
dollars which was good we made a profit
definitely made a profit and then we
just continued to go up then Co hit in
2020 I hope I don't know what it's like
where where you are but we were closed
as a city for maybe like 30 days or
something uh you yeah yeah and so
anyways we became an escape you know for

[30:01]
anyways we became an escape you know for
the rest of the country and so the whole
town boomed so 2020 even though we're
closed for 30 45 days that was actually
our best year at that point even in that
was your second year we opened up in
2018 yes third year yeah and and then
2021 even better I don't know if we
doubled but it was pretty D close we
were in like 5 six million range 2023 we
backed off maybe 10 or 15% which was
once again disheartening for me I was
like oh my gosh okay so this isn't going
to go straight up but I think that was a
rebound from covid and some craziness
there I think the whole from what I can
gather The Whole Town's that way and
2024 is about on Pace I I'd say with
2023 okay I constantly worry that
there's some kind of like economic
slowdown it hasn't happened yet but
every year I I worry about that but but
yeah we're good in terms of sales it's
just obviously it's awesome when the
numbers go straight up so do you own the

[31:00]
numbers go straight up so do you own the
land and the building yeah that's
probably a story for another day but
yeah it was uh it was just really kind
of creative way of getting the land and
it just you know I think a lot of luck
and and it just worked out with a seller
that was tired and and so I stepped in
there and it was a weird lot it is a
weird lot and we had to do a lot of head
scratching on like how do we make this
work and so yeah you know when when I
talk about the millions invested most of
it goes into the building and and the
land and in fact the first call it year
and a half I at least the machines in
hindsight in hindsight yeah maybe like
wasted money like we talked about
minimizing risk I didn't want to be able
to hook for multi-million dollar
machines and so that's what that's what
everyone thinks the big cost is but no I
bought those ones I knew we were good
and I could pay for them in cash the
building just any metal building like
that or orine enal 35,000 ft is going to
be costly but yeah we I tried to

[32:02]
be costly but yeah we I tried to
minimize everywhere I could I don't
recommend this but like I install the
speaker system myself like the sound
system like I mean yeah was that the
best use of my time I don't know you did
what you could yeah yeah like I'm buying
it off Amazon myself like that kind of
thing and so so anyways yeah uh yeah I
forgot what the original question was
but there you go yeah so you recouped
your money over the course of two or
three years on this yeah yeah or or or
less it's something that now on
hindsight I have really good terms but I
think I could have done even better but
I think about debt a whole lot I've got
several different loans for different
things and like I said I worry a lot
sometimes about the state of the economy
and stuff and what my kind of debt load
should be I am nowhere close to being in
trouble or whatever but it's something
that I think about a lot and I try to
manage it's something that some debt
I've refinanced or has come due at much
higher rates which really sucks
and then others are low and I might not

[33:00]
and then others are low and I might not
pay them off for a long time and yeah on
paper yes I have recouped everything and
more that's awesome how how tall is your
building yeah it varies I think the
tallest point is maybe about 40 feet
good way to if you're standing in the
front of the building outside and you're
looking at it I believe that's 26 feet
tall the the front facad so it varies a
lot obviously we built a hill inside
inside of buildings that's why there's
the height knowing what I know now did
it have to be as tall as it is no uh I I
think we could have shortened that I
don't know what kind of cost savings
there would have been let's say we
brought it down 5T maybe it wouldn't be
significant enough to do it but just one
of those things we didn't know and
another thing is we wanted to create
this kind of grand big kind of feel
anyways yeah it's a big building for
sure it's something that I worried about
cable if I need to repurpose it what is
it going to be and and the best thing
can't come up with as a movie theater
thankfully I don't think that's going to

[34:01]
thankfully I don't think that's going to
happen but but yeah that was I was going
to ask you that what else could this
building be yeah I know you thought of
that yeah you can get creative with a
bunch of stuff that I mean the big
problem is half of the or two-thirds of
the building is a big concrete Hill I
don't know you all kinds of like storage
or again I I think you could do a pretty
sick movie theater take a little bit of
work or yeah I don't I don't know I I if
I had to think of that I I I'm not
worried about know I could repurpose it
so if someone were to find a building
with similar Dimensions could they rent
it and put one of these in there or
would it be just too much yeah
definitely so
2022 2023 I spent a lot of time working
with two amazing guys that are super
experienced with franchising and we met
in person for months and started to
develop this brand of how can we
franchise this and it was something that
I had a lot of stuff in my personal life
going on outside of business and I just

[35:00]
going on outside of business and I just
need to put a pause on that but but
anyways like I have we have done a lot
of thinking about that and so really I
think the best thing to do there is
figure out what's your budget and work
backwards because obviously if you say
okay I've I got $10 million to blow okay
that's a different answer if you're just
trying to piece something together okay
maybe you look at something what I said
with Renning a snow machine or whatever
but if got a
building these are the things you have
to figure out one you have to have a
hill and everyone I think takes that for
granted I think you can build it with
scaffolding and supp plywood and stuff
but you still like you got to figure
that out there's a lot of weight that's
going on that in terms of the the snow
and the people and stuff and so not
impossible it's been done before but
that's a big one second thing is how are
they going to get to the top of the hill
I have a Magic Carpet you can definitely
install one too it's not that crazy but
if they're going to walk just keep that

[36:00]
if they're going to walk just keep that
in mind and then like I said you need to
be able you don't even have to recycle
the water I would recommend it not that
hard to do you just got to catch it
drain it off somewhere filter it all
that and then obviously you have to have
the snow machines and stuff but yeah if
you had I'm trying to think what would
be a good like just an empty Warehouse
or something like that if you thought
that it was a good location and the
right kind of
demand if you figured out how to build
the Hill which is not that hard but
that's the biggest thing yeah you could
definitely do something like that you
can also
consider don't do a huge hill like if
you've got a big warehouse and you still
want to do something like this blow a
ton of snow in there and you can make
little slides whether it's for kids or
just whatever you make a long a longer
Hill right instead of a taller one yeah
there's so much you can do just a quote
normal Warehouse would probably be good
you're going to want to have a little
bit insulation we don't have any any
anything special but you don't want like
a barn or something like that unless

[37:01]
a barn or something like that unless
it's just really cold so yeah I mean
there's a lot of different ways you
could hack this together it's it's tough
because a lot of these existing
buildings are in such industrial areas
that consumers would ever think to go to
right yeah the First Trampoline Park I
saw here in Knoxville was like I don't
know way over 10 years ago and it's like
in the middle of industrial park and I
know it's changed a lot but I thought it
was the coolest thing ever like driving
in this like weird industrial park and
it was p i gone to one in a long time
but I don't know if that would
necessarily stop me but yeah I would
definitely consider location for sure
yeah I was thinking about trampoline
parks too so with that in mind is there
like a fun Matthew 3.0 concept that you
you dream about you got poers you got
slides and and I also want to hear about
what you're actually working on as well
because we didn't yeah definitely so
yeah I keep a running list of ideas and
when it comes I'm sure you've got long
list here but when it comes to
amusements yeah it is such an amazing
industry and so like I'm definitely

[38:00]
industry and so like I'm definitely
going to do something new one kind of
highlevel concept that I was thinking
about is do you know what like a Ru
Goldberg machine is have you ever heard
it's like it's a name for a Contraption
of like if you ever played mous Trap
Back in the day where it's like one
thing happens and this blah blah blah
and so anyways even though Pet's a
little tired I always think about it
okay like what is everyone's favorite
hole but it's the last one it's because
it does something crazy and it's like
why can't every ho be like that and yeah
do something cool there I've got some a
rubbe Goldberg putt yeah yeah yeah yeah
and just some really cool just you know
lasers laser trip sensor for this and
then this drops and speaks and all kinds
of crazy stuff that' be cool I yeah I
definitely will do something else in in
the amusement space right now personally
I am trying to I guess reel back a
little bit and I've got so many irons in
the fire and I ended up growing a lot
and just doing everything myself and so

[39:01]
and just doing everything myself and so
actually I've made a commitment to
myself and my girlfriend Heather like
I've got my next step has to be
delegation and building out the team of
of the right kind of people delegation
is something I am terrible at and so
it's something that even though it's not
that sexy that is my next my next thing
if if anyone's listening to this and
thinks that they can help me in whatever
way I mean at least put it in the
comments and I'll look had it but yeah
I'm definitely going to build out a team
to get some of my life back is the next
thing that's smart yeah it's tough I'm
still trying I've gotten better at it
but it's not like some you like flip a
switch and you're like all right
everything's delegated it's just you
always are working at it like every time
I do something in a perfect world if I
was strict with myself every time I do a
task it's like do you have to be doing
this Chris do you have to be and 80% of
the time it's no yeah yeah and it's
something that like even though I know
that on
paper it's like you you constantly

[40:01]
paper it's like you you constantly
struggle with this okay this is a
one-off task I'll never repeat it again
it'll take me three times as long to
explain it to somebody I'm just going to
do it and then I've ran into a lot of
people that are good people but they I
guess really want me to hold their hand
through everything and maybe that's even
my fault but it's something that I'm
just looking for more people that are
capable autonomous I want to support but
can support me too instead of just me
trying to build up somebody's career or
lifestyle or whatever I need those great
people and that's what I'm that's what
I'm after yeah okay aren't you building
something outside right now like you
were talking about those kayak rental
machines what is what that so so yeah um
I've got a subdivision I was working on
even right before Co it's been just such
a nightmare and so it's 80 acres it's
beautiful if you want me to I can text
you some pictures or whatever but it's

[41:00]
you some pictures or whatever but it's
it's right on the water and anyways we
are in an area that is very short on
housing and if you look at Knoxville and
severville and everything especially
postco like prices were some of the
highest increasing in in the country and
it's because a supply demand thing like
the supply is not there and there's a
huge demand and so anyways I was like
okay I've done some what I think are
amazing things how hard could be you
know uh taking a farm and you know
putting Utilities in and chopping it up
and putting a road in blah blah blah
blah blah I'm not even building the
homes I'm just selling them to somebody
to build them and come to find out
that's a little harder than I thought
and really what is so hard about that is
you're dealing with all these local
utility companies all these local
governments Planning Commission zoning
all this work that I don't like I like
to take action I like to build I like to
get my hands
dirty you're dealing with processes and
red tape and and permits and procedures
and you look at them and I mean I've

[42:01]
and you look at them and I mean I've
even told him I'm like this is why
there's a housing problem no one can get
anything done and so anyways I am close
to the end there I did it in two phases
the first phase was the largest and
we'll call that a 100 home sites which
are done people living AC yeah yeah okay
there's single family homes what size I
I'd love to hear that if you don't mind
I'd love to hear the unit economics like
what you paid for the land how much each
lot is being sold for how many square
feet and all that yeah of course it's
something that I am still in the process
and we've blown the budget out of the
water it's in in in a negative way
anyways I can give you some rough stuff
there's about 100 lots that I sold in
the first phase and there's call it 75
Lots coming in this phase that we're
finishing we're actually Paving today
that's one of the last steps so close to
being done and so anyways with the first
phase and the second phase there's
basically three kinds of lots there 's
what I call the standard lot there's a
premium lot and there's a river lot or

[43:01]
premium lot and there's a river lot or
premium however you want to say it so
standard lot you're looking about a
third of an acre comes with all
utilities that's going to run call it 50
60,000 something like that just for the
lot and then you've got premium Lots
which so are you selling the lots to
builders or to the consumers and then
they have to find their own mainly to
one home builder but I have sold some
individually but yeah so selling those
to home builder then however they
package it together maybe they however
they come up their price for the home
the home I was originally wanting
something that was what I would call
Affordable housing after covid I don't
even know what that means the houses are
probably you know3
$400,000 which their new construction a
three bedroom most of them that kind of
thing beautiful so anyways then there
are the premium Lots which um are larger
than the third of an acre they they
might be um you know on a corner or just
a a better setting that's maybe 10 or

[44:00]
a a better setting that's maybe 10 or
20% of the lots and that'll be called on
average 70 75,000 per lot what what I
receive and then there's the river Lots
which are like Ultra
Premium I have sold quite a few of those
I still have quite a few as well I think
the cheapest one I sold was maybe
100,000 I think I sold one for like
180,000 170,000 so pretty good they're
absolutely beautiful and so anyways yeah
so got a blend of all of those I've got
about 40 River Lots in all so you work
back and do the math I think probably
just doing off the top of my head
probably have potential real estate that
I would receive proceeds for when you
add them all up then I'm probably don't
quote me on this I'm probably in it I
don't know five or six million in
development cost something like that
it's definitely it's taken years off my
life so I don't know if that is what
it's asked worth but MoneyWise yes it is
it is a good return I've learned that
there is no one no other job title

[45:02]
there is no one no other job title
that's hated more than a developer so
that is or custom home builder that's a
brutal business oh my gosh everyone
hates you everyone thinks that you're
just rolling into the money and not
doing anything and so it's anyways I
don't think I'm going to build another
subdivision for a little bit there been
rough stuff but but no it's I am proud
to be able to deliver homes to families
a lot of them is their first home maybe
it's forever home for some people really
happy about that it's something that I
think I just need to get step away from
it a little bit take a breather and then
I'm sure I'll do it again but yeah we're
finishing up phase two if anyone wants
to look it up the name of the
subdivision is called the farm at
Riverbend kind of fancy name but yeah I
think it's beautiful I think it's a
great oh right in Seville yeah yeah it's
um it's probably I don't know 20 or 30
minutes away from pitch and Forge snow
in the countryside that kind of thing
yeah maybe 20 30 minutes away from
Knoxville yeah seems to be a popular

[46:01]
Knoxville yeah seems to be a popular
area yeah definitely and so yeah if
anyone's in the area want or wants to
move give me a shout I'll definitely
definitely show you a house man I mean a
Riverfront lot for 150 I would love to
live on the water that is a dream oh
yeah unreal yeah if I wasn't living I we
bought our dream house like last year or
something and yeah I I thought about
moving down there and yeah thankfully I
found where I live now and just so happy
with it so Matthew like why why do you
go so hard on these ideas like you you
just don't you don't start small you're
like let's do a roller coaster let's do
a $5 million indoor ski resort let's do
a $10 million uh subdivision have you
ever started a business that was like
small you like dip your toes in and I
mean I guess now that you say it like
that yeah I never thought about like
that especially when I was younger all
the little hustles and you know flipping
and this and that and it's all relative
I I I'll say even when I was coming out
of college I started a CrossFit gym with

[47:01]
of college I started a CrossFit gym with
some friends and I started a frozen
yogurt store when that was hot and like
at the time each thing that it did was
like the biggest thing for me you just
kept leveling up yeah yeah and and
looking back at some of those things now
I'm like okay that was nothing but man
like I probably lost more sleep during
the frozen yogurt store kind of days
which in hindsight wasn't that big of a
deal
I lost a ton of sleep there and ton of
stress and there many times like whether
it's just somebody being critical or
whatever you just want to say okay I
give up and and so anyways I think
you're seeing hindsights 2020 kind of
thing I think you're seeing not my final
form but where I currently am and you
know another thing is like I said in the
beginning like I think I like to jump
out of the parachute and or jump out of
the plane and figure it out with the
parachute on the way down and there's
something about that pressure I think
that I do do well under a lot of times I
want to pull my hair out and scream like

[48:01]
want to pull my hair out and scream like
I and say I don't want to do this
anymore but then when I'm sitting around
long enough it's like okay let's you
know let's try something else and yeah
that's just how it goes yeah have you
thought about putting an Alpine Coaster
in beaver's Bend I I did a little
research and I mean it's obviously two
and a half hours from DFW they get two
million visitors a year so A fifth or a
sixth of the size of Pigeon Forge but
there are zero coasters there right now
yeah it's something that I get really
nervous with any physical business that
isn't my area that is that totally on me
okay yeah you're all over it seems you
know the US with some things and I've
never done that before so maybe that is
like a you know a new frontier for me
yeah I mean it's you said yourself like
you can't really start one of those for
10 million bucks nowadays yeah but like
again I think if somebody's listening
and is inspired like there are ways
around that or ways to get involved I
did not do that first one all myself I

[49:01]
did not do that first one all myself I
did not own it all myself and there was
somebody actually in the group that
owned 1% of it did some survey and
Engineering work for us and I don't know
if it was a mistake or not but he got 1%
and so I think if somebody was
determined enough like even a deal like
that I would be happy to coach somebody
through how to get involved in something
like that I saw a lot of your comments
on some of the posts you made about our
conversation and
yeah going back to everyone's just so
saying why something won't work and
their comfort blanket yeah it's they
would never do it so they don't want to
think it would work what what shocked me
about the the candy comment was you had
half the people saying hey this has
already been done so you can't you lose
that's great yeah yeah and then you've
got the other half of the people saying
No this can't work you're an idiot and
it's like well both of you can't be yeah
yeah
and were many wanted to comment with iiz

[50:00]
and were many wanted to comment with iiz
like oh I'm that I'll take a picture of
my candy store right now and it's okay
like people can doubt or hate or
whatever but if there was actually
somebody listening to this and like man
I I want to try to like you know put
something like that together you don't
have to do it alone you don't have to be
the main person but there are ways to
get involved with something like that so
for me I'm I'm saying right now like I
don't know how comfortable I would be
about investing a some like that in in a
different state so it's like how would I
get involved one thing that I have is I
can consult and that can take a lot of
different forms I could also just I like
to help and or maybe invest passively
there's a lot of different forms how
could you the person that has no
experience do it okay we fly out here
where I'm at not my house but in Pigeon
Forge ride a lot of these ride them all
I'll even get you the tickets if that's
what you want figure out how they work
take a bunch of pictures put together a
presentation go back home or wherever
this is going to go and start pitching

[51:01]
this is going to go and start pitching
some people on like hey this works I if
you didn't watch the last one literally
the investment decision was started by
uh somebody that knew my family sent us
a picture of a line of people lining up
on this Alpine Coaster I'd never seen it
before and that is what started it all
like that video is what started it all
and it's interesting because for every
business I've started there's probably
been a dozen each that started like that
there was just an idea if someone came
to me with and then it it always Fizzles
yeah it never comes through right so the
fact like how much had to go right for
it to go from a picture text to you
actually having a coaster right what
incredible odds for that to actually
have come to fruition yeah and I will
have to compare idea books sometimes but
mine is very thick of idea and even
stuff that I've tested tried and I'm
sure you have too but it's something
like yeah there's a ton of them that

[52:00]
like yeah there's a ton of them that
like either just didn't come together
wasn't a good idea we didn't get the
right feedback at the right time to make
something like that work and it's all
good it's uh there are so so so many
ideas out there and like my friend my
friend had an idea just the other day
and he told it to me and personally I
didn't think it was the best idea but I
was like hey why don't you why don't you
go run this past a few people see what
they think see if they can get excited
about it too and his answer to me was
that I don't want to tell them because
they might steal it St and yeah I know I
just whatever yeah he just doesn't
understand it yet of course and so I
guess it's just like yeah there's people
listening and they're like man one
exercise I do I was thinking I was
journaling last night about delegation
because I got this problem that I was
talking about and it was like okay what
creative ways can I fix this like what
creative ways can I view how would I
view this working in my life maybe in a
nontraditional way and work backwards
and so if your thing is I would love to
be a part of an Alpine Coaster I would

[53:01]
be a part of an Alpine Coaster I would
love to own even any of it and I'm
willing to work really hard like start
with that and work your way backwards
like I'm literally saying contact me and
I will help you get there not
financially but through knowledge and
and so yeah I mean if anyone's
interested here's your shot all right
you guys heard him yeah it's funny about
ideas cuz a lot of times people think
that you got to get the timing right of
an idea and I think that is
very true to an extent like you I'm
usually more early than I am late to an
idea but one thing that I've noticed
about ideas that I never launched like I
I could launch them today a decade or
two later and it would still work yeah I
remember in college this is 13 years ago
I read an article about some guys out of
Utah company called EOS scraps and they
went to grocery stores and restaurants
and they got all of their organic waste
and they did restaurants first but then
eventually they learned they just wanted
fruits and vegetables so they only went
through uh grocery stores and they

[54:01]
through uh grocery stores and they
grocery stores were just paying someone
to throw these away yeah and they their
pitch was hey pay us to throw them away
so they had a negative they had over
100% cogs yeah right they were getting
paid to take the stuff and then they
literally just R to this big industrial
Warehouse in the Villa nowhere they
stacked all this these nasty pieces of
produce up they mixed in some sawdust
because they needed some carbon and they
just composted it indoors and then
bagged it up and sold it for like $12 a
bag to Home Depot and Lowe's and it was
like really good soil and so it's like
no one loses yeah right they get paid to
take the product it's better soil and
they ended up selling to chem like some
major company and I was going to copy
them with a couple investors when I was
in college 12 years ago and I had a
couple lunches with them I put a deck
together and we were literally just
going to do the same thing yeah like I
was in Alabama they were in Utah they
only have 10% of the grocery stores in
Provo and they were crushing it so it's
like there's plenty big enough and I
never did and like I could launch that
today and I remember going I went to

[55:00]
today and I remember going I went to
Whole Foods actually like I got so far
down the road with this idea I talk like
yeah we don't we'd love to have you take
our produce and that's like the hardest
part and I could launch that today and
it would still be just as good if not
better exactly and there was and around
the same time period I was a student at
Alabama I read an article about in
Insomnia Cookies and it was just a
Cookie Shop way before crumble their
whole pitch was like college campuses
and delivery open till 400 a.m. and you
could get like warm cookies of milk
delivered to your door and they were
crushing it and it was like they were
open at Old Miss they were open at
Mississippi state they're open at LSU
there was nothing Alabama yeah and there
was nothing in
Alabama yeah and then I went to these
investors and they're like yeah let's do
it and I I did a bunch of research I
never did it and I don't regret it
because I just did something else right
but today right on the Strip right next
to the Alabama Stadium there's an
Insomnia Cookies yeah yeah and they

[56:00]
Insomnia Cookies yeah yeah and they
crush it and that could have been mine
and I think we're very similar because I
I could tell those stories all day too
and like I I don't know I get a little
pissed at myself sometimes like you see
that you're like man I I could have done
that and maybe that's a flaw with me but
then then I see others and it's like oh
yeah okay so I was right and it's like
okay yeah may maybe I just would love to
help people get past that idea phase and
start figuring out how to actually make
things happen in whatever capacity I
just I don't know reading those comments
again it's just like so many people are
stuck on no and maybe the answer is no
but yeah just like anyways I that's one
reason why I'm supporting what you're
doing I think it's amazing the the live
call-ins where people are giving
business ideas I I think I said this
like I'm in the car literally like
giving my opinion out loud hey Chris
