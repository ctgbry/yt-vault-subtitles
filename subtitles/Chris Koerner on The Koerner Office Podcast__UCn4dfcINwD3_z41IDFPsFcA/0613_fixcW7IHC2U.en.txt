his online trade school 80 85% margins
he's doing $3 million Topline revenue
and it's Revenue paid by the government
he gets free leads there's always a
business to make something a little bit
easier The Prompt is the thing that most
people get hung up on because they're
like how do I make money they don't know
the right question to ask chatbot or
rapper or something that's like okay
help me find ideas that are mine that I
am philosophically maybe literally
bought into if you can start messing
around with this now I promise you we
are still super
[Music]
early just zooming out real quick you've
seen the memes on Twitter like Charlie
light it's like screenshot someone's
biography on LinkedIn and it's like he
was a SAS bro then he was a crypt bro
then he was an expert in nfts then he
was an expert in iOS now he's an expert
in Ai and it's like we just hop from
Trend to Trend I just feel like this
time it's different AI is different like
it's just it is changing the world like
I've never seen how do you close your
eyes you're like no I don't want to talk
about it because it's the new trend and
I want to Buck the new talk about home
service is like no it's it's incredible

[01:01]
service is like no it's it's incredible
and we're going to talk about it okay so
this idea is a longterm this isn't a
cigarette butt idea this is a long-term
idea I'm stealing it from your episode
with James Camp because I freaking loved
it detox centers and I'm using detox
very broadly I'm not just talking about
drugs alcohol but dude and the thing you
guys didn't talk about graphy I was
gonna bring that up today too crazy yeah
I got stuff for this okay like yes
there's gambling yes people are addicted
to their phones and dopamine but like
with young men in particular is a really
big deal and I think in the same way
that when we grew up in the 90s and
everything was microwaved and we had
fruit rollups and there's you know
yellow five and red Dy 16 in our Foods
now we're like hey we got to go organic
I can't believe my parents fed me this
all this stuff I think our kids are
going to be like very strict with what
devices they allow in the house what
you're able to watch How It's streamed
protections that are involved Etc and

[02:01]
protections that are involved Etc and
addiction is a very real addiction
having these Retreats or centers or like
things focused around not the drugs not
the alcohol but addiction centers for
digital addictions I know that sounds so
stupid and anybody listening might think
oh digital addictions aren't a real
thing they're a real thing I mean
scrolling on Instagram scrolling on Tik
Tok they're real things and so I think
that idea is a very interesting one I
completely agree and I will say like the
difference between how the the public
perceives today versus 5 years ago I
would say like any Millennial anyone
today aged call it 25 to 45 they grew up
with graphy accessible in the house if
nothing else from like the family
computer okay so I would I would reckon
that over 90% of Millennials in some
form or fashion have had a lot of
crossover with porography in their life
but the difference today is it's
becoming more generally acceptable that
is bad like for physical reasons mental

[03:02]
is bad like for physical reasons mental
reasons relationship reasons spiritual
relationship you name it five years ago
it's not wrong with this like everyone
looks at it everyone they're not even
struggling with it because there's
nothing wrong with it right but today
there's more data there's more studies
and it's like okay yeah maybe this isn't
maybe there is a maybe there is a
trade-off to this maybe there is
something bad about this because if we
launch this business five years ago it's
probably too early right well have you
seen the studies I mean testosterone and
Men today versus men in the 1950s
60-year-old men in the 1950s had a
higher testosterone level than
20-year-old men today yeah that's a fact
that's craziness you look at studies
with loneliness in particular in young
men and when it's just easier for them
to open a computer and scroll and be
distracted than to go on a date with a
woman or to meet people out in public
it's a massive problem epidemic of
loneliness depression suicide all of
those things and I think that they're
linked to digital media so anyway

[04:00]
linked to digital media so anyway
as I was like listening to your James
Camp episode I couldn't believe you guys
going bring it up I was like waiting for
you to to mention it but yeah gambling
sure but the phone putting your phone
away and like having these Retreats
where it's just off and you are able to
engage with people and you have these
meaningful interactions facilitating
those having a business that facilitates
those would be amazing you know what's
interesting is last summer my two oldest
boy and girl went to summer camps for
church and I chaperoned both of them and
both of them had the same Rule and I
wasn't in charge I was just chaperoning
no phones like literally you they put
their phones in like a Yeti cooler and
they lock it in the leader's tent for
the entire time okay so I got to witness
this on the girls and on the boy side
and we're out in nature the whole time
zero zero complaints from both weeks
from one person not even one person
complained that they didn't have their
phone no one was bored they had an
amazing time not one person was like oh

[05:01]
amazing time not one person was like oh
I missed my oh I gotta play Candy Crush
oh my what are my friends doing they
were fine they're good like We crave
that we it's it is you know I leave my
my phone at home sometimes on accident
my first gut reaction like dang it oh my
phone and then it's like ah this is nice
this is nice yeah I mean and in many
ways it's been helpful because like
people have apple watches and they get
notifications or they've got their
computers like they're constantly bing
bing bing notifications happen
but I think have you heard of these
things called what are they called
Faraday cages M where so essentially the
Faraday cage will block I think the term
is
electromagnetic waves yeah and that's
how that's how phone signals are
transmitted is through electromagnetic
waves you're like you literally can't
even get a message even if you wanted it
so some people put them put their phones
in bags when they go to sleep some
people put you know have a basket at the
front of their house but I think selling
those types of things where it's like
limiting your access James has a brick

[06:00]
limiting your access James has a brick
on his phone where like literally he
can't even get messages you have a setup
on your phone I remember where were we
we were in we we were in Texas and we
were like getting in and out and I was
like oh dude I want to see your Tweet
really quick and you're like yeah I
can't like what do you mean you can't
like this is awkward you're like oh I
have opal set up where between like 4
and 6 I don't I don't remember what the
time is 4 and 6 I don't have access to
Twitter and I'm like I know but it's
really important could couldn't you just
go and like change the settings really
quick you're like no I I like can't even
change the settings until after that
window is closed anyways so like we're
not we're not seeing it for the next two
hours so I anyways I think those types
of demand are growing and starting a
business around facilitating real
experiences would be incredible you know
what's crazy to me is so my oldest 14
and a half he has a phone he got a phone
for his 14th birthday first time he has
all kinds of screen time restrictions
set up I can manage that from my fun
brawl star is his favorite game he can
play there for half an hour day he has a

[07:00]
play there for half an hour day he has a
ton of access to ESPN because he loves
sports I asked him just yesterday just
yesterday and we live in a a nice
affluent area caring parents they're all
involved in their kids' lives I said how
many of your friends have screen time
restrictions on their phones like they
all have phones sure any sort of
restriction zero none of them really
none of them yeah like it at church it's
pretty common at our church but like
most of his friends are not in our
church zero restrictions which is just
crazy to me crazy that is really crazy
to me Apple made that a feature for a
reason right and I'm shocked that more I
mean tiny little sample size here I'm
just shocked that more people don't use
it for their kids well one of the things
that's interesting is and maybe there
could be a business developed around
this I am terrible about missing
meetings that's just like a natural
nickis and it's gotten way worse ever
since I started putting my phone on do
not
disturb and I started putting my phone
on do not disturb because I just kept

[08:00]
on do not disturb because I just kept
getting notification after notification
after notification after text after call
after and it was just like all right I I
have to be able to focus and this phone
is distracting me so I put it in do not
disturb and then you and I have had
conversations you're like you're not
available finally got to the point this
last week where I decided I got to
figure out how to at least let some
notifications through Etc so you can set
it where it's like all right from this
app I can get these notifications from
this person I think you could do that in
these Retreats and maybe that's your
software where it's like before you go
here are the three people that my phone
is allowed to be notified of and the
phones are kept somewhere with an
employee who's monitoring them and then
when they get to the camp they're doing
their thing and if one of the three
people on their emergency contact list
pops up then they immediately get
notified in the camp right because there
is that fear of like what happens if my
son is sick or my wife gets injured or
whatever there's an emergency I don't
know that there are one offs that you
can do in apple maybe there are but I
think that would be a really cool way

[09:00]
think that would be a really cool way
upfront to just like have a
questionnaire they fill it out and then
the software does it for you and it and
it creates it because that that would
make it really EAS easy and accessible
yeah like I think it should be a retreat
where it's like no phones right that's
the whole point but then at the end of
it it's like okay you're you're clearly
GNA go back to having phones let's talk
about some healthy principles like
here's how to use your iPhone settings
you know what I'm say because like it's
unrealistic to say you're not going to
go back to a phone here's how to manage
it better because most people know and
we're not incentivized to learn how to
turn off notifications because we want
the dopamine we went to the moon in 1967
whatever the year was 69 1969 it was the
summer of 69 as some would say JFK got
shot I got my real six anyways we have
more compute power in our pockets than
was on the craft that guided them to the
moon and we use it 99% of the time for
scrolling entertain apps so so I love

[10:01]
scrolling entertain apps so so I love
your ideas it's like there's a you could
you could
totally tailor this thing so that it
works well for you that could be a
business in and of itself just that
might be a really cool AI info product
right it's like hey Chris you wow we
iterated to this I'm actually really
excited about this because this wasn't
even on my radar the info product that
you sell is teaching people how to limit
their screen usage by giving them
knowledge on where to go in their
existing settings and change them does
that make sense where it's like the
course you sell is this digital product
teaching them how to limit their access
on screen time yeah or the AI chatbot
buddy that you sell right the The Prompt
that you sell and then all the haters in
the comment you can't build a business
around a prompt they're already
thousands and they're doing great you're
they're doing amazing well dude I
remember we were talking about this and
you were like oh just you could do set
up chat GPT to be a phone number in your
phone and you can text with them MH chat
GPT just released these things called
tasks MH where you can set it up to

[11:02]
tasks MH where you can set it up to
remind you to go do things whatever you
could literally have you could sell a
course showing people how to set up on
their phones anytime that they accessed
an app to get a text from chat TBT hey
just want to remind you you're trying to
limit screen time today no judgment just
wanted to make sure you knew that this
was the third time that you've done this
in the last hour you know what I mean
like it can go anywhere from my wife
which is like what the freak are you
doing this is the third time you used
this in an hour to like you know mahat
mandhi hey no judgment I get it you can
do this if you want but it's been three
you know what I mean like you could
totally tailor the spectrum of of how
hard it's going to be that would be a
freaking cool info product yeah do you
mean an actual info product or like a a
rapper like an AI rapper you totally do
the rapper I'm just saying start with an
info product if you want to know how to
do this dude oh my gosh sorry my mind is
going right now all you're doing you're
selling a prompt
yeah hey do you want to do this yeah I

[12:02]
yeah hey do you want to do this yeah I
want to do this show me how to customize
my iPhone so that I don't do X Y and Z
cool pay me 20 bucks here's 20 bucks
cool here's the prompt put that into
chat gbt it will walk you through step
by step that's it dude so I did research
for this for selling prompts there's a
website called prompt.com where you can
buy and sell prompts no way yeah it's
and you're literally just buying the
text The Prompt and this is a pretty big
business Holy balls like look at these
mid Journey prompts on the homepage4 to8
each tons of art abstract
paintings that's freaking incredible so
many levels to this like okay I could go
buy this intricate nights Celestial
prompt on Mid Journey for
$3.99 I pay $4 for that once and then I
take it over to Etsy and I could sell
prints using that exact prompt like
downloadable prints using that exact
prompt for $4 each $4 once sell them for

[13:01]
prompt for $4 each $4 once sell them for
$4 each like oh my gosh dude I just I
just clicked on productivity personal
financial advisor for my budget and
there's a dude it's a very long thorough
prompt it gives examples it tells you
exactly which what information it needs
you to enter in in order for the prompt
to return the right type of advice it's
four bucks they're selling it for four
bucks let me take it a step further Nick
take that $4 prompt buy it and then go
to repet and then use that prompt to
make a chatbot and then go to cursor. a
and then use that turn that chatbot into
an iPhone app and then go to the Apple
App Store and sell it for $4.99 or $2.99
a month like you literally you buy a $4
prompt you use free tools or tools that
cost $20 a month like repet to turn it
into an app turn it into an iPhone app
now you have a SAS company what are we
talking about here Nick this is insane

[14:02]
talking about here Nick this is insane
I've never been on the site okay I I
just there's a there's a section for
marketing and real estate here's a
prompt for five bucks real estate
listing description generator so it
prompts you it tells you all the things
you need to enter into it there's a
script written and then it will spit out
a really high value description turn
that into an app or a software hire a
prompt engineer
prompt yeah yeah so video is cool but
you know what's better long form audio
via podcast and my newsletter TKO
pod.com go there to subscribe for free
to my newsletter it's one email a week
very tactical 1500 words per email and
then go to my audio podcast three
episodes a week stuff like this you're
going to love it all free no sleazy
sales TKO pod.com how many
63-year-old real estate agents named
Carol in Omaha Nebraska know anything
about Chad GPT but how many of them
would pay $5 for an iPhone app that uses
that $ five prompt real estate property

[15:00]
that $ five prompt real estate property
evaluator prompt real estate agent Bob
prompt oh my gosh how to make money in
real estate prompt this is insane we've
talked about this it's the prompt The
Prompt is the thing that most people get
hung up on because they're like how do I
make money they don't know the right
question to ask you now have a a
database of questions that people ask
that you can then start interfacing with
the with Chachi BT to do you know what
it reminds me of it reminds me of like
Google 20 years ago you work for Google
you learn like from the inside out how
SEO works and then you go then you go
launch a company you get accepted a y
combinator you know built on SEO because
you learn those principles from the
inside of Google right imagine people
working for open AI really learning how
prompts work and using that to leverage
in their own businesses because like
Google was all about okay SEO is a
blackbox there are backlinks there
onpage seo off-page seo oh how do you
figure this out and you build entire

[16:00]
figure this out and you build entire
Industries not businesses but Industries
around SEO maybe AIT a website built on
SEO maybe an SEO agency where you do it
for other people it's the same thing but
prompts at open aai are what SEO is for
Google SEO is like how a website talks
to the internet prompts are like how you
talk to AI dud again we both talked to
James Camp he's about our age he's a
little bit younger and he started he
started doing SEO as a teenager he just
got interested he was curious and and
then he talked about the series of
events that happened that led him kind
of to where he is and all of that
started just because he was
curious and he kept following that
Curiosity and he kept getting better and
better and he picked an industry that
was growing like crazy like you said
this several times the you know Rising
tide lifts all boats he was riding the
right wave and I think the reason I
wanted to keep talking about AI in these
episodes is because it forces us to
continue to look at it and get more
ideas and understand what is coming if

[17:02]
ideas and understand what is coming if
you can start messing around with this
now I I promise you we are still super
early you're going to see many many
opportunities that's why many of the
founding members of open AI are gone
because they went to start their own
companies they saw other opportunities
that they could go and do it isn't
necessarily because Sam Altman is the
devil although they may have
disagreements with him it's because man
my financial opportunity is way better
because I'm seeing these opportunities
having worked inside the machine I want
a site like this is my long-term AI idea
for today and then I'll give you a dumb
little kitchy one after that okay
where's the prompt base for turning
prompts into SAS products I don't know
of a website doing that and I I did my
research so like repet can help you code
cursor can help you code apps but like I
want to build my own app that's like
built on a prompt but it's a chatbot
it's an llm but I only want to do it in
a few clicks cuz I'm just a dumb
internet marketer I'm not a coder how

[18:01]
internet marketer I'm not a coder how
can I actually take a a prompt that I
buy for $4 from prompt base and turn it
into a $4 a month SAS product with a few
clicks I don't know if that exists yet
it's going to it exists but not with a
few clicks because yeah you could do it
with repet cursor with all those you can
even do it with chat GPT where you're
like how do I create my own calendar
system I don't want to use tidy Cal and
I don't want to use calendly how can I
create my own app that I can send to
people they can look at my calendar and
they can schedule and you can start that
process with open AI chat GPT and it'll
tell you okay well you'll need to do
this and you'll need to get this API key
and you'll need to then code this okay
how do I code that I've never coded that
before what give me a step-by-step
process right it's it's very iterative
because it's waiting on the question
from you so that it can answer the
question that you give it but I think
what you're saying is how do I give it a
general idea and overview of I want
build my own calendly and then just have

[19:01]
build my own calendly and then just have
it execute on that is that what you're
saying yeah like in a in a box like a
llm SAS product in a box the last step
of the of the process is like submit to
the app store for approval even you know
tip to tail so it would be like hey I
wanna I don't like cly or t tidy C I
want to create my own help me do that
and then it it asks you question okay
what Future Would you like would you
like this this is how these work okay
blah blah blah right give me your zap or
API credentials give me this give me
that after and then after 30 minutes of
it asking you the questions it goes cool
I know what you want here you go and
then you test it and then you would say
all right submit this to the app store
for approval yeah and maybe this is just
what repet will look like in six months
right maybe that's just where we're
going but I feel like it could be
simplified even more that's just a good
framework like everything can be
simplified even more there's always a
business to make something a little bit
easier here I saw this Instagram reel of

[20:01]
easier here I saw this Instagram reel of
a you got the motor motocross bikes how
do you get it in the back of a truck you
put like a a 2x6 as a ramp leaned up
against the trucks you get it up there
then you get straps you strap down the
handlebars you strap it you got like
because it can't be tilted yeah yeah so
there's this new product that's just
like this metal bar that sits in your
truck and you put your motocross bike in
there and you just attach it to the
handlebars and they're selling millions
of these things and this isn't anything
new we can we can use straps but it's
just it's like 10% easier than straps
$10 million product right like there's
just as a framework making something a
little bit simpler or easier or less
friction will always be a good business
opportunity Chris are you ready for this
let's do it I didn't talk to you about
this you have no idea what's about to
what's about to hit you my friend I have
announcement to make oh shoot I declare
bankruptcy no I'm just kidding dude we
have probably five ,000 downloads in our
first week three to five I can't

[21:01]
first week three to five I can't
remember exactly where we are if you
include YouTube it's more than that I
want to see every week and we could pick
AI rapper of the week if there's
somebody who go who creates something
really cool send it to us I would love
to see what people are creating someone
asked me the other day what is a rapper
so explain to
rappers you couldn't I couldn't do it I
feel like I've been talking a lot I want
you to explain the rapper rapper swhite
label is basically the same thing you're
taking something that's complex and
expensive and harder to build maybe VC
funded like open Ai and you're just
putting something on top you're just a
middleman it's like a a technical
middleman for something so it for
instance here's a wrapper idea I want I
want to sell an app in the app store
that helps sourdough bread Bakers bake
better bread okay that is just going to
be a chat GPT rapper it's going to be a
prompt but it's going to be like a we're
like Christmas wrapper we're wrapping it

[22:00]
like Christmas wrapper we're wrapping it
in better branding and more positioning
and marketing y y y the only thing I
would say to add on to that is we're I
think we're using rapper very broadly
because I would also apply rapper to
open AI just released chat gbt tasks so
what you can do is you can schedule
tasks and here's a s very simple example
of a task hey I create my food calendar
every month where I plan out what my
food's going to be I want to make sure
that I have six meals with fish six
meals with chicken and six meals with
steak and then you give it like all the
parameters on the 25th of every month I
want you to send me suggestions with
ingredients lists and what I need to buy
at the store because that's when I go to
Costco and so you set that up once and
it just reminds you on the 25th of every
month moving forward and you don't ever
have to think about it again you don't
have to sit down and be like okay what
am I going to cook next month and what
what ingredients do I need it's just
like giving it to you and it saves Maybe
30 minutes or an hour of your time right

[23:00]
30 minutes or an hour of your time right
that's an example of a task if there's
somebody out there who's like oh dude
I'm a Trader and I've set a task so that
every morning at 6:00 a.m. when the
Market opens I know what the opening
price is of apple and I'm and it's you
know saved me X period of time and I've
made money by day trading doing this I
would consider that still a rapper right
you're you're using AI as a tool if
there's anybody out there who's
listening that's been playing around
with this stuff and they're like oh dude
I've been using it for business
applications and I've made money in this
way
that's what I want to know about how
have you been using AI to make money not
necessarily just like a cool chat
interface but how have you created
something systematized it within your
business that you're currently making
money with
andure us all yeah I just think
featuring those would be so interesting
because it's going to give us ideas
we're gonna be like wow I didn't even
think you could do something like that
and it's going to give people who are
listening ideas like we're just sharing
the best ideas that people are using to
create these rappers and yeah that's
that's my ask this week like just start

[24:01]
that's my ask this week like just start
sending us some of your ideas send them
to AI coof founders.com because I don't
want all those emails yeah and it's like
on one hand it's like oh these rappers
are cheap there's no value there's no
inherent value but dude like I did a
podcast this last week about this guy on
Etsy that sells 8 personal finance
spreadsheets he sells like hundred a day
for $8 something like that he makes a
lot of money selling an $8 spreadsheet
over and over and over fully automated
literally passive right you and I could
make a personal finance spreadsheet we
know how to do that but we might just
would rather pay $8 for someone else's
because it might have different features
right so like a Sourdough app I talked
in a previous episode how I use chadt to
make better sourdough bread so surface
level is like I'm not a customer for an
app like that because I know all about
chpt I know how to use it but then it's
like you know what I don't want to
fiddle with the prompt and I don't want
to I just want it to work so if I can
pay $5 for it to just work yeah I don't
need to sell this to 63-year-old Carol
in Omaha I can sell this to 38-year old

[25:01]
in Omaha I can sell this to 38-year old
Chris who loves Chad GPD and just wants
to save a little time right yeah rappers
are not going anywhere a very stupid
simple example of this would be you and
I do our editing for our podcast we've
created very specific prompts now that
we use hey go through this episode and
pull me five quotes that blah blah you
know and we sort of listed out you could
sell that if we wanted to it's a
business yeah it is a business you know
what I mean but there are these things
that we have used with AI that do help
us make money I would would love to hear
how other people are using it to help
them make money like it doesn't even
have to be agents oh well I've got this
agent going out and scraping and they're
going to bring it back and clean like
okay that might be just just too high
level but what are you doing just simply
on a day-to-day basis that's making
money with your business the GPT for
sheets we talked about how are you using
GPT for sheets and whatever data you're
looking at to to help your life be
better totally want to hear about it I
really want to hear about that we need
to stand up this email what should we
call it what should the email be cuz I
don't want to get all these to our
personal emails every time I give out my

[26:01]
personal emails every time I give out my
personal email on the podcast not a lot
of people email me so I don't really
care okay all right never mind how's
that for vulnerable Chris or Nick coof
founders.com either one of those how's
that for both us or both or both of us
we could just have Kelly go in and
categorize them easily add to a folder
it's free publicity to you it's good
content for us so yeah that's amazing
okay so we were talking about quitting
two days ago I talked to a guy that has
a good friend with the school Community
for guys that want to quit and he's
doing six figures a year it's high
ticket I don't know what he's charging
but handful of people in a digital
school Community trying to quit so
there's an idea for you okay another
thing quit. a uh is a rapper I don't
know how how well they're doing but it's
it's just it's just a someone to talk to
it's an AI to talk to that is built on
how to quit so there's one thing dude
I've got an AI rapper for you oh are are

[27:01]
I've got an AI rapper for you oh are are
you ready yeah I think we both could do
this but you in
particular you should build an AI rapper
that talks about how you evaluate
opportunities so like we're just talking
about this and we're saying hey seems
like is a big problem what would be the
first place you would go to validate
whether or not as an addiction is is a
problem Google Trends you probably go to
Google Trends and just see hey an
addiction over time has that y Google
Keyword tool complexity I go to the web
archive um I go to Reddit I'd go to a
third party tool that shows how fast
subreddits are growing like I go to
Gummy Search I yeah yeah so if you did
all of that stuff and then you started
selling it as a rapper where somebody
goes in and they're like hey I think
that this is exploding in popularity and
I want to build a business around this
like what do you think of the
opportunity and then it goes out and
does all the things that that you know
you just mentioned or that we might use
to validate something and returns back
an answer like you've essentially just
created a Chris rapper yeah it could it

[28:02]
created a Chris rapper yeah it could it
could be that and or it could be how do
I think of good business ideas right
because I could easily use AI to extract
every business idea I've ever talked
about and put it in an llm or rapper or
spreadsheet or whatever but how do I
find my own ideas I want because we you
and I both know from our experience in
co-founders like you've got to be
philosophically bought into an idea for
it to really work for you and the people
that have emailed me and said hey I
started a stump grinding business based
on your podcast this guy Tyler Mumford
he heard our podcast from July started a
stump grinding business why because he
really loved it no it was because he
worked on a tree triming crew in high
school so like he had that experience
and two he did B2B Enterprise sales and
our idea was about B2B stump grinding
sales so he took those two data points
from his life and that enabled him to
philosophically buy in and start it
whereas 99% of people myself included
when I hear a genius idea it's like oh
my gosh that's genius idea but I'm not
going to do anything about it because I

[29:01]
going to do anything about it because I
never worked on a tree Tri crew I've
never done it's not my idea chatbot or a
rapper or something that's like okay
help me find ideas that are mine that I
am philosophically and maybe literally B
yeah yeah yeah like help you get to the
next question or ask the next question
that helps you get to the answer yeah
because Chris's ideas are cool those
aren't mine dude I had somebody listen
so I had Hector rendes on the podcast
and he talked about his online trade
school which is freaking 80 85% margins
he's doing $3 million Topline revenue
and it's Revenue paid by the government
he gets free leads just like what the
freak that's a money printing business a
listener I talked to they were like hey
I listened to that turns out my dad was
the education commissioner for the state
of XYZ and I realized I have a lot of
connections in space he and his brother
are starting one like they're in the
process of starting one in two separate
states he like he called me and he he's
like your episode kind of planted that
in my mind so I think what what you're

[30:03]
in my mind so I think what what you're
on to is everybody has their own set of
experiences that they can pull on having
a rapper that helps them uncover where
the opportunity is and where they can
leverage those experiences is very
interesting where it's like okay cool
yep I've helped you validate the idea
works great why would this work for you
what are you tell me about your
experiences or or these this set of
experiences might be good for executing
on this business do you have any of them
dude yeah imagine if that rapper could
tie into their inbox and tell them why
this idea is good for them because
people forget like they forget like
let's say I I put out I put out that
tweet this morning about the the cement
plant right selling these retaining wall
blocks and you see that and you're like
oh that's oh that's really cool and then
but you plug that into the app and the
app is like dude you you helped your dad
make that walkway and you loved it you
emailed him all about it seven years ago
and he's like oh yeah
oh now I really love this idea I forgot

[31:00]
oh now I really love this idea I forgot
like it reminds them why they should be
philosophically bought into it because
they might have forgotten H what's the
guy on Twitter who has the is it the
crush the memory yeah Eric Kaiser yeah
great idea I think it's a amazing idea
because how many times do you have an
idea you're walking around and you're
like take out your phone and put it in
notes or you take out your phone and
text somebody or whatever but yeah
there's there's cool software now where
you can just dictate automatically go
somewhere it organizes it Etc that
coupled with with remember we talked
about a couple weeks ago like a
accountability group MH like dude you
could create an accountability
Rapper Hey I want you to remind me every
Friday because that's my business
time to follow up on these ideas and it
just there's always the reminder that's
coming through that's pushing through
your notifications that you've got set
up like I actually might do this today
go to tasks and be like all right every
single day
at these times I need you to remind me

[32:01]
at these times I need you to remind me
to be on this meeting or to do X Y and Z
because I may be up working and my
messages might be behind another window
but chat TPT is like always open kind of
where I am yeah that's a really
interesting thing using it as an
accountability partner we're so smart
we're really smart and goodlooking
someone tell our wives please they need
to know don't tell my wife she does not
want to know her life is on the
internet but she listens to all these
though right
Nick are you there Nick you good hello
darkness that's like the the litmus test
to know if your wife listens to your
podcast is if you talk about her because
if you do then she
[Laughter]
doesn't that's amazing oh we're off the
rails we are off the rails this is good
though this is good all right what you
think please share it with a friend and
we'll see you next time on the the ker
office
