look at this freaking thing right here
are you really telling me you can't buy
one of these inflatable tents take it to
some public land get some gorgeous
pictures and videos of you and your
loved one camping in it and then list
those pictures and videos on Airbnb
verbo hip Camp Etc and renting out that
experience for $200 to $400 a night or
you can't do that you can't do that
because no one's doing that guess what
you can just do things don't ask for
permission if it doesn't work or if the
government kicks you off the land big
deal take your inflatable tent go home
why are you testing more things come on
lamping is a thing experiences are a
thing people will pay a premium for cool
experiences like this as long as they
can brag to their friends about it full
