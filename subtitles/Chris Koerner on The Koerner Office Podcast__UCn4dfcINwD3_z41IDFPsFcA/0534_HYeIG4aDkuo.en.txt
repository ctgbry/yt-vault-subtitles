look at this freaking thing right here
it might look like a viral dog leash but
what you're actually looking at is a
brilliant business concept that you can
learn from this product has been sold
millions of times and not because it's
gone viral on Tik Tok but because it
looks viral in real life it turns heads
I used to have a great D and I hated
walking that thing because I'm an
introvert believe it or not and every
other person would say one of three
things you should put a saddle on that
and ride it that looks like a horse that
looks like a deer but my point is this
you can take this idea and make other
viral dog leashes or other dog products
cuz every time you go take your dog on a
walk you're marketing believe it or not
why not a leash that looks like a
massive ship rope or a leash that looks
like you're handcuffed to your dog or a
leash that looks kind of look like this
optical illusion right here or a
glow-in-the-dark LED leash or not even a
leash at all just take this concept and
learn from it and get all my business
ideas right here
