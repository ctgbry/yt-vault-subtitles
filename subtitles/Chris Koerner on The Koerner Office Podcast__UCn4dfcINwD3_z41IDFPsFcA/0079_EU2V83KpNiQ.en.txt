[00:00]
good good do you have any feedback for
me any way I can make him
better uh man I'm really really like
just eating it all up right now so I'll
think about that and shoot you an email
if so but um I'm I'm really really
digging everything so far thank you yeah
all right well um thank you for joining
so I I try to keep these to 10 minutes
each if at all possible sure um and we
were just now starting so would it be
helpful if I just went ahead and kind of
summarize the question that you already
submitted and then you can tell me if
that's maybe that's inaccurate at this
point and then we can just go from there
yeah that's great all right so what you
wrote to me was um let's see control
find so I'm a wantrepreneurs software
engineer developing consumer electronics
mid-30s make 185k I already trade my
time for money I don't want to start a
sid all so that requires more of uh uh

[01:00]
sid all so that requires more of uh uh
more of that I already tried cleaning
gutters I want something that scales I
read your newsletter and I'm desperate
for my first dopamine hit of someone
willing to pay me for something I didc
created and I will add it does feel
really good so you're on the right track
I would love to sell something online I
have no e-commerce experience I have no
experience trying ideas I have no sales
experience or online marketing
experience Etc but I would love to get
this experience question one should I
prioritize getting experience with
something like clavo which is a
marketing email marketing software that
gets me exposed to marketing and testing
ideas or work for a company part-time
selling their outdoor grill product
commission only and learning how to
generate my own leads question two I
love spreadsheets but I have no
accounting background can you recommend
a resource to learn the business lingo
important metrics Etc so my first
question to you Aaron is two-part one
has anything changed since you submitted
this question and two I would love to
hear more about this side hustle

[02:00]
hear more about this side hustle
opportunity to sell
grills um yeah so I did the only thing
that's changed since then was I was
approached um through a family friend
who's who's done very well for themsel
and they they they have some sort of
steak in a company that makes a really
nice um Grill and they gear it very much
towards like the yachting industry it's
an electric grill that's approved for
marine use so I I was and and so they're
they're trying to get into other Market
Mark um namely like um the condo Market
where you're not allowed to have like a
gas grill on your porch if you own a
condo or um the the uh the the RV space
so they're they're trying to find some
some hungry people to to get their
product into these areas so that's kind
of been the only thing that's changed
and um I forget the second question I'm
sorry um has anything changed since you
submitted this
question um yeah no nothing's Chang
changed I'm still um yeah everything's

[03:02]
changed I'm still um yeah everything's
still basically the same okay so this
grill company how are they currently
marketing is it kind of an old school
business with Boomer owners or are they
pretty Savvy at marketing very much um
like old school marketing as far as I
know and how are they doing with that
they go to trade shows and and things
like that I don't have any sort of
insight
into um into how they're they're doing
it but it's a they It's Made in the USA
so I would assume I believe they're in
um some very very I won't mention the
name but they're in some very very
popular like um boating stores um that
are you know that are
common okay so they're mostly just doing
the old school stuff trade shows retail
are they doing any direct to consumer or
e-commerce shipping through their
website at all I I think they have
e-commerce through their website of from
from what I understand um I've I've

[04:00]
from what I understand um I've I've
looked into it and you can purchase one
online as far as I know but I don't
believe they're on any other platform
like Amazon or anything like that okay
so they've kind of sought you out
thinking oh this this guy he's young
like he he can help us and you're like
uh I I want to know how to help you but
I'm not quite there yet do I do I fake
it till I make it do I use this as a
learning opportunity do I say nah no I'm
gonna try something else is that kind of
where you're at yeah they're they're
very much I think they would be eager to
have somebody commission only who's
hungry on the team who's who's also like
my background is mechanical and software
so I can speak technically um to their
product and and explain that kind of
thing so they're eager for somebody who
has that background um because I don't
it wouldn't Seem doesn't seem to me like
from what they've said like that that's
a a common thing somebody going from the
technical sides who wants to get into
sales so that's kind of that's that's
kind of what the the pitch to me was so

[05:00]
kind of what the the pitch to me was so
to speak and how much do these grills
cost uh I want to say you know they
start at around $1,000 and go up from
there um but
they're that's kind of the P I think
they might they may have a lower budget
one in the 750 range okay do you know
what their revenues look like I yeah I
have no insight into any of the any of
those details what about how many
employees they have a lot of times you
can kind of reverse engineer their
revenues yeah I would say
I would say probably between 50 and 100
um they do like all their Manufacturing
in the US and uh they have I would say
between 50 and 100 employees wow okay so
I would think it's probably like a low
eight figure business that sound right
yeah that's a that's a good guess and
there I'll give you some insight into
why I'm asking these questions because
when it comes to selling things
especially on commission only it's
really helpful to find um a sweet spot

[06:02]
really helpful to find um a sweet spot
right like there's always a trade-off
between the ticket size that you're
selling call it swimming pools um or you
know verse t-shirts in a
an American Eagle store verse the
difficulty of the sale and occasionally
you can find a sweet spot where it's
like a the sale cycle is not too long B
the ticket size is high at least in the
thousands um and C it's not a very hard
sale right but like it it occasionally
you can find like some Arbitrage there
but usually if you're selling $100,000
pool it's going to be a six-month
decision it's going to be really hard
it's going to take months or years
before you earn your first dollar but
then once you get that pipline full you
can make some really good money um
that's usually how it works so I'm
trying to understand what would a
commission look like and how successful
is this company already and if they're
thousand
grills I see this as a perfect type of
product that you could sell with Google

[07:02]
product that you could sell with Google
ads um just direct Google ads because
your cost per acquisition is probably
going to be like 40 to
$140 but if they've got good gross
margins then they can afford to scale
that and to pay you um a
commission okay would would you say that
like there would
be I a number of your um newsletters and
and podcasts and stuff you mention outs
scraper and different online tools that
you can use to generate leads I don't
know and I don't just being that they're
Boomer owners I don't know how far down
the rabbit hole they've gone this and me
being a software engineer I'm very very
I would be very very eager to to write
some of my own scripts or use use like
an out outs scrapers API to to have a
server running in the background that's
like trying to find the owners of a
condominium per se that um and and and

[08:00]
condominium per se that um and and and
get leads that way for a customer who
might put a grill and on in every single
one of their condos or mandate that all
their um their tenants have have an a
grill that meets certain requirements is
there I'm trying to find a succinct way
to ass this but I guess I'm wondering if
it's if this organization has not gone
down this route yet to employ some of
these tools um do you see that as like a
I guess something that I could use to
set myself apart or kind of get into the
you know absolutely okay yeah I mean
trade shows work right like I'm not
going to dog on what they're doing but
their their eyes just aren't opened to
the new ways of of finding customers
right so right if you were to be able to
bring them new
ideas and and say to them with respect
hey what you're doing is working keep
doing that don't like you obious viously
don't want to dog on what they're doing

[09:00]
don't want to dog on what they're doing
but then say why don't you let me try
this and just start throwing a bunch of
terms at them that are going to that's
going to confuse them but make you sound
smart right like I'm GNA run an outc
scraper API to pull up the owners of
these condominiums on the back end and
then I'm going to go to Google ads and
I'm gonna I'm gonna go to moz.com and
get a paid account and I'm going to
learn where the Arbitrage opportunities
are because some longtail keywords have
high competition but low volume but
other ones have high volume but low
competition and so I really want to
start bidding on those and they're going
to be like whoa uh yeah that sounds
amazing I assume they're going to be
like that um and to me this seems like
the perfect opportunity for you because
it's enabling you to basically start a
startup with no money now commission
only that's fine because the alternative
to this is to like start Drop Shipping
someone else's grills uh and you're
gonna have to learn with that and you're
going to lose money on your first few
orders or first hundred orders and it's
just going to be really hairy but

[10:00]
just going to be really hairy but
if they're willing to pay you uh for
Success then I don't think you have much
to lose but your time and you don't even
have that to lose because you're the
reason you're calling is because you
want to learn you want to develop new
skills so I would think this is the
perfect opportunity because they're a
family friend and if if you didn't have
this opportunity I might very well
suggest that you call a company like
this and ask if you can do something
like this but you already have someone
offering so that part is done um so
being more specific if I were you I
would take up take them up on that offer
give yourself a 60-day out um just in
case you don't like it um that way you
can be respectful to them in 60 days and
to yourself and there won't be any hard
feelings especially since it is a family
friend and give yourself 60 days to
really see if you can move the needle
and move some of these grills um but
conversely if they are requiring you to
be um commission only ask for an ads

[11:00]
be um commission only ask for an ads
budget and just tell them direct like
can I just have like a, doll a month
that goes straight to Google ads um like
I can set a cap on the budget and I'll
tell you straight up I'm learning right
I I am learning um but it's going to
cost a little money for me to learn but
I can't I can't spend my own money on
your Google ads do you think they would
agree to that I I think so I mean from
what I've seen they would they would be
willing to do something like that and I
guess that prompts me to want to ask you
what as an engineer with no sales
experience what do a what does a fair
commission look like for somebody like
me wanting to get started but bringing a
little bit of you know technical
experience to the
table it's tough because a commission on
a grill that you had to pay $50 to get
through Google ads is going to look
different from a commission on a grill
that you acquired by cold calling a
condo owner right okay and so I would
try to work out those details side by

[12:01]
try to work out those details side by
side with them and say and just go cover
all your bases say if I cold call a
condo owner and sell 100 grills what is
my commission look like if I spend $40
in ads to sell one Grill what does a
commission look like if I find an
influencer to make a video of your
grills and he sells a thousand but I
have to pay him you know a hundred bucks
per Grill what does my commission look
like so I would just make a structure
that covers basically take all the ideas
of what of everything you might want to
do to sell these grills
and try to see if you can get a a
commission and a budget attached to each
one okay makes sense yeah completely a
lot of influencers are going to be like
yeah oh wow you want to give me a
percent of every grill that I sell you
and everyone else that means you don't
want to take any risk I'm going to need
some money up front um and so some
influencers will be willing to take that
risk but usually the best ones are going
to want some money up front so they feel
like their time is is being

[13:00]
like their time is is being
guaranteed understood okay great this is
definitely some food for thought I
really appreciate you talking through uh
this with me um I'm and I think that's a
great idea about the 60-day kind of like
let's try this out and see how it goes
because um you know some of my questions
to you in the email right like I I have
some other interests in things and I I
uh I was kind of wondering too if I
should pursue those and I can call back
about that another time but like yeah
the 60 days I mean I I I think that's a
great idea so I really appreciate you
mentioning that yeah absolutely and I
would recommend I think it's it's
moz.com or ahrefs.com pay for something
and it's usually going to be 50 to 150 a
month month a month you can cancel
anytime where you can do keyword
research specifically and find those
Arbitrage opportunities where people are
searching for it but not a lot of people
are bidding on it and then use that data
to bring to the owners so you sound you
sound like you're more knowledgeable
than you already are but you have the

[14:00]
than you already are but you have the
intent to become that knowledgeable by
the end of the 60 days right gotcha okay
and then I would yeah I would take like
a a Google ads course or something uh
just find a guy on YouTube or find
a a udemy person yep and like it's just
if you're a data guy you you will love
it like Google ads is just fun it's just
really really fun and if you can crack
that code you'll never run out of money
so
okay Hey listen I I'm so grateful that
for you having me on I'm definitely
going to uh definitely going to try to
come on in the future and ask but um I'm
eating your content up and I I think I
think what you is are doing is awesome
and your partner as well so thanks again
thank you eron I appreciate that a lot
and good luck all right talk soon bye
all right see
you all right so thank you to everyone
live streaming on YouTube right now I
would love to hear your thoughts or
comments this is only being being live
streamed to YouTube um I just like it

[15:01]
streamed to YouTube um I just like it
better I can see it easier the UI is
better so I'd love to hear any questions
you have maybe you have a business or
you want to start a business and if
there's filler time like there is right
now um I'll answer them live if um if
I'm speaking to someone and he's asking
for advice or ideas I want to hear your
advice and maybe I'll read that and I
I'll shot you out and and credit it to
you but um would love some interaction
so I have a couple pre-submitted
questions that I'm going to read while I
wait for my next guest so let me
navigate to
those all right this is a good one this
is a good one one
sec all right here is a question from
Ashley I sold an investment property one
unit in a 20 unit complex to a developer
through an 18mon long sales process
where all owners had to agree to sell to

[16:01]
where all owners had to agree to sell to
the developer that sounds like a
nightmare I was initially very happy
with the price I got doubled my money in
five years until I found out the prices
that others received I was not the
lowest but the highest prices were 250k
more this this is a substantial
percentage difference as all prices were
under 1
million I know that comparison is a
thief of Joy I hate that quote by the
way and I should move on and learn from
this experience but I'm struggling to
get past it the question is how to
emotionally move past this I understand
all the logical re reasons I can't
change the past still made a good profit
I can learn to negotiate better Etc but
it's getting past the missed opportunity
mindset how you handle the situation
Ashley I feel for you I've been there um
I have seemingly I'm quot quoting right
now wasted months and years of my life
at opportunity ities that didn't pan out

[17:00]
at opportunity ities that didn't pan out
I've been there um and it's especially
mading like you would be happier today
had you not learned that fact you can't
change it but you would be happier right
that's that's why you're writing
in I would suggest that you
just you develop a chip on your shoulder
and like I I don't know how to tell you
to move past it other
than make that fuel you
to at least make up for that amount of
money that you feel that you missed out
on with a future real estate deal right
that's the tuition that you paid to
learn more about negotiating with
developers um Andor with other
tenants for me when I had something
terrible like this
happened the only thing that fixed it
was finding more success success is the
best revenge right and then it ended up
being I became more successful than the
person that had run wronged me and then
it really became easy had that never

[18:01]
it really became easy had that never
happened being real with you right now
I'd still be struggling I'd still be
angry uh I wish I could just tell you
that I just I just forced my way through
it and I I moved past it and moved on
but I didn't so I think you just need to
put your head down and focus on making a
lot of money at whatever brings you a
lot of joy and attach that success to
this
um moment in your life where you felt
wrong and
just I say this every now and then but
everyone is insecure right I'm insecure
Steve Jobs is insecure everyone's
insecure about something the difference
is do you know what you're insecure
about do you have the self-awareness of
what is making you angry or what is
making you feel uncomfortable or or UNC
or or not confident right if you if you
have a self-awareness about your
insecurities or about the chips on your
shoulders then you will be significantly
more successful and more happy in the
long run so you clearly do have some

[19:00]
long run so you clearly do have some
level of self-awareness because you're
asking me um I just suggest that
you you just keep crushing it and keep
trying to make money and buy real estate
and start businesses and it will come
but it can take time all right we have
Alejandro in the
lobby Alejandro hey Chris how you doing
good how are you can you hear me I can
hear you yeah can you hear me
hello yeah it's a tiny bit of a delay
but I think we're good there is a delay
so it's we just kind of have to work
with
it yeah um okay can I can I cover your
question real quick and then you can add
more
context absolutely y okay so you wrote
in and said I just started some doing
some digital marketing work for some
friends and happen to connect with a dog
trainer who's trying to grow her
business in the Dallas for Worth area
she asked if if I had any ideas to help
her grow she's on social media but

[20:01]
her grow she's on social media but
doesn't put any time into it she let her
website expire she's actually a very
good
trainer she's has a good track record of
past clients from what I can tell I'm
convinced she needs to take social media
gooogle my business seriously which is
step one to get a digital footprint and
reviews but what I really want to do is
some outof the-box ideas for marketing
like events giveaways
Etc some ideas these are your ideas
setting up a free training day at a
local dog park in maybe run ads post
flyers or Outreach partner with rescue
organization two go on local dog
Facebook groups m mom groups and share
dog training content to those looking to
get training I've never done this so not
sure if there's a certain code of
contact that needs to be followed okay
so can you add any context to those
questions or tell me if anything has
changed since you submitted them so
nothing has changed and I feel like
that's as much context as I can give off
top of my head other than any questions
you might have on specifics but um yeah

[21:02]
you might have on specifics but um yeah
how big is her business do you
know I would say it's pretty small she
probably does
maybe 1,500 to 2,000 a month in dog
training um she typically will do about
four or five sessions at like 500 bucks
for a total right it's about 125 bucks
per
session 125 bucks per session okay and
is this her fulltime slon thing yes
does she want to scale it or is this a
dream that you have for her no she wants
to scale okay and she just just doesn't
know where to start she she done 100%
word of mouth and she's never really you
know invested much in the digital space
never really done any kind of
advertising or marketing on her own end
other than a couple Instagram posts here
and there but she just has she's good at
what she does but the business aspect
the marketing aspect is not not her
thing right has she or have you

[22:00]
thing right has she or have you
identified direct competitors in the
nearby
area very I have very Loosely um I've
even worked with some other dog trainers
in the DFW area that I was not impressed
with at all spent you know three four5
thousand for a boarding train $10 10day
boarding train which was not worth it in
the end um but as far as specifics I
don't have a list I don't have any kind
of specific info yet yet okay and do you
know how much work she's doing right now
to grow her business or is she just
trying to run it she is really just
trying to running she has not like I was
saying before not put a lot of effort
into um you know any kind of marketing
or
advertising doesn't do a lot of the
Social Media stuff she's trying to get
in the social media thing trying to do
Instagram which has kind of worked a
little bit um you know he's kind of
driven some traffic too there but not
much just running the business do you
mind telling me the name of her business

[23:00]
mind telling me the name of her business
so I could look it up and I I can also
edit it out if you would prefer that but
I'd like to get more context here
absolutely it's a send dog trainings a c
n
d all right let's see what we got
here is it in Arlington
yes all right okay so how long have they
been
opened that's a good question I'm not
100% sure it's over a year for sure I
mean she's been dog training for a
number of years but this specific
business I'm not I couldn't give you
exact
time does she use any software for
managing her her bookings or anything no
no is there not a um a Marketplace for
dog
trainers is there anything like that
like in Uber for dog trainers where they
they match you with customers there
might be I I'm not familiar with one or

[24:00]
might be I I'm not familiar with one or
every time I've looked up anything I've
never seen anything like that but that's
an interesting idea I would look into
that a lot of times there is a random
Niche Marketplace for something like
this that people they just they don't
think to look for it
um another question I have
is would it be that hard for her to get
her website back up and running again is
she I'm actually working on that so we
are her domain name she really wants
keep the same domain name she has and um
so somebody else had bought it so we're
working on trying to get that back and
I'm building up the website right now so
what about Ascend trining decom if you
can't get that one back is that one open
do you know I don't know that one
specifically open I do know as send dog
training TX for Texas is open um she was
not not too interested in doing that one
but she's open to it she's still trying
really hard to get her old domain name
back so okay yeah if I were her I would

[25:02]
back so okay yeah if I were her I would
invest in a tripod and simply let a
camera start rolling as she's training
these dogs um just to document and 95%
of the time nothing special or
interesting is going to happen but
occasionally something will happen and
she can just start by posting that to to
Instagram to any short form video
platform and I would also suggest that
she makes a list of her five biggest
like most direct most local competitors
and then start reverse engineering how
they got to where they are today um
looking at the web archive scrolling way
back on Facebook and Instagram and look
at those first posts look at the popular
post on Facebook and Instagram that got
the most comments specifically so I'm
I'm I'm kind of obsessed lately with
reverse engineering why certain things
go viral and it's always in the comments
and it doesn't she doesn't have to find
something that went viral right I'm just
using that as an example look for the

[26:02]
using that as an example look for the
posts of her direct competitors that
have outperformed okay so maybe she has
a competitor named Arlington dog
training and their average Instagram or
Facebook post gets seven likes and six
comments then you see a few that get 70
likes and 60
comments don't just look at what they
posted to get that but specifically read
the comments on that post of what they
are saying and then create social media
content that
helps regenerate comments like that on
her own post does that make sense yes
yep so like for instance maybe maybe one
of our competitors posted a video of
them training a dog how to heal and they
had a CH caller in the video and all the
comments were like oh those are those
are bad those are unethical y y you can
use that right maybe now her brand is
like ethical dog training or kind dog
training um you know you know what I'm
saying yeah yeah yeah that makes sense

[27:00]
saying yeah yeah yeah that makes sense
okay it's kind of like what people do uh
what Amazon sellers do they will go to
competing products and read the negative
reviews and see oh okay everyone's upset
that this plastic widget always breaks
around week three okay so now not only
are we going to make sure that part of
our of our widget is metal and not
plastic we're also going to talk about
that in the title and in the top of the
description so it taking the pain points
of a competitor and highlighting those
of your
own got it
okay um yeah I think that should be that
should be enough to get her going and of
course like get any website back up I
wouldn't worry about getting the exact
website I'm sure she wants it but it's
really really hard to convince a domain
owner to get them to sell their website
unless you're you're really willing to
pay up yeah that's what I've told her
and I'm pretty sure we'll go with a
different name but she's just she's new
to this whole so once she kind of gets
into once she realizes it may not work

[28:02]
into once she realizes it may not work
out I'm sure we'll find some else yeah I
get it anyway I'd love to hear a
followup uh once you make these changes
absolutely I appreciate your help thank
you no no problem have a good day thank
you sir yep see
Lou how doing Chris good how are
you oh p ke I uh you know I apologize um
I'm up at the public library cuz I'm in
Colorado right now my wife's brother is
getting married and so the house is like
an absolute you know chaotic situation
so I came down the library and I'm just
waiting for this guy to clear out of the
room so I'll be ready to go here in a
second no problem so you need a little
bit of
time just a couple minutes it's
literally he's supposed to be out of
there in one minute so I think we should
be Gucci it is not a problem I'm
rereading your question right now yeah
I'll get and and um and we can kind of I

[29:00]
I'll get and and um and we can kind of I
I know that you I think you posted about
this before yeah because I I um dm'd you
about it um and so I I mean we can
really take it kind of uh whichever
direction that you'd like uh if you just
want to you know know more about how
like it's uh put together or how we're
you know planning on revenue and all
that jazz um I was just we're we have a
lot of ideas about Hi how are you doing
and here I go um a lot of ideas about
like
how and things already underway about
how we're going to you know make uh
Revenue um off the model um but just
want to see I I really admire you I've
been listening to your podcast now for a
little bit and you're like a a business
Sant uh from what I can tell and so I
you know want a chance to talk it you
know talk it through see that we weren't
uh Missing on anything and if you had
any kind of creative things that we
hadn't come up with thank you well I
appreciate the the kind words and um

[30:00]
appreciate the the kind words and um
yeah I think it's an interesting
business did you find me from when I I
tweeted about assumable mortgages back
in the day no i' I've been following you
for a while actually um okay I think
maybe before you revealed to the world
that you were Chris um I I don't know if
I've been following that long but
certainly quite a while I um I think
retweet is has some of like the most
interesting content because it kind of
like hits me where I live talking about
you know different structures and
different ways to get things done and um
so in that regard um I really uh
appreciated following different folks on
retweet and you were one of the ones
that everyone was like oh this guy has
great follow and I agree so all right
well thank you
so I'll get everyone caught up so you
have a platform that enables people to
find assumable mortgages and from what I
understand an assumable mortgage is when
you buy a property and you just assume
that existing mortgage which today the
big benefit of that is not having to pay
Seven to n% interest rates you can

[31:00]
Seven to n% interest rates you can
hopefully capture their three to 5%
interest rate is that right yeah and I
mean I we've actually been struck by how
low some of the interest rates are like
you know I'm a veteran which is kind of
how this whole thing got going my buddy
reach out to me was like Hey you know
you know things about assumable I was
like yeah I've got a couple of assumable
mortgages and I think we have a home in
Nashville that we have uh VA loan on
because my wife and I are both veterans
well she's still in but um and I think
that one's like 2. 25 and it's something
it's some crazy number like 70% of the
ones which kind of makes sense given
like where the funding environment was
you know maybe um 18 24 months ago um I
think it's something like 70% are under
4% interest rate so that's yeah I mean
you're talking about potentially up to
you know thousand dollars or more
savings on a per month basis and then
over the life of the loan I mean
hundreds of thousands certainly okay so
where is your business at right now are
you guys pre-revenue post- Revenue where
are you at your journey so we're uh kind

[32:02]
are you at your journey so we're uh kind
of like right on the the front cusp of
um really recognizing um some Revenue so
we have generated um a pretty remarkable
amount of leads I think we've probably
you know pushed um like 30,000 leads uh
to our real estate Partners um and
they're the ones that are actually going
to you know be making those referrals
out to whoever the local uh real estate
folks are to actually help those people
um and so the only you know the thing
about uh assumable mortgages is there
it's not like a Panacea and it is a
little different from a typical
transaction it it looks a lot like a
regular transaction um you go through
many of the same like underwriting uh
processes that you might you know
otherwise for a normal new loan um but
it just the servicers uh who are
actually like collecting you know funds
every month um on those mortgages uh
they don't move very quick and actually
just this week HUD uh announced that
servicers could charge the previous
maximum was like $900 and so it wasn't
really you know worth it to them to like

[33:02]
really you know worth it to them to like
rush or you know staff up those offices
and I mean assum mobes haven't been like
a big thing for decades um because we've
been living with such low interest rates
but um they just bumped that up to
$1,800 per you know transaction and so
um from the folks that we've been
talking to um in in you know across uh
servicers um they're all trending
downwards and so most of them are around
you know maybe 60 days now getting back
know getting down towards 45 and and you
know even even faster so now what is 60
days
exactly that's like basically from the
time that the person engages with the
serer to get the the the loan moved over
from the pre from the seller to the
buyer's name um and that's where they
collect all that documentation and we do
have um we we do provide a service that
you know helps folks like get all their
documents in order and and you know how
the how the servicers basically to you
know try to move things along more
quickly okay so first tell me how your
platform work So when you say you drove
leads to your real estate partners and

[34:00]
leads to your real estate partners and
all that like yeah how how does it work
yeah so um we have the the right now the
only Nationwide uh platform uh where
folks can go into whatever their local
area is they click on a property they
find one they like that makes sense for
their you know financial situation they
click you know assume this home at that
point you know we've got real quick are
these for sale are they for sale or are
they just homes that exist that you know
have an assumable mortgage they are for
sale yeah we're um that's kind of down
the road that's something that we're
thinking on uh kind of from like an
ancillary um uh Revenue perspective to
um sell that capability for real estate
agents to be able to to look at that uh
those off-market homes uh in their area
you know try to get that that listing
because that's especially with what's
going on with n AR and and things
shifting on the buy side um those
listings are like right more valuable
and so um that's another thing that
we're thinking about but right now um
for the on the retail side of it it's

[35:00]
for the on the retail side of it it's
just focused on yeah those homes that
are listed for sale and so they click on
that we you know have it all Zapped up
in the back end and so um uh they get
reached out to from from our folks who
kind of you know get the particular
their situation um you know Cate that
with u the information that we've
already collected from them as far as
like down payment you know that they're
capable of providing and then that gets
pushed off to an agent um you know in
their local area that we've already
we've already had a conversation with
we've already provided them resources
and details about how these transactions
are you know supposed to go and then
yeah and then they they run with it okay
so I'm a if I'm a consumer and I want to
buy a home with an assumable mortgage
I'm gonna go to your website I'm gonna
search in my area I'm gonna see one and
I've got it pulled up now so I can oh
that's a nice house oh 5.4% okay nice
you click on it and you purposely can't
see really the details of the house yet
right well so um there another uh this
is like a totally bootstrap thing me and
a bu you know me and my buddy uh was

[36:01]
a bu you know me and my buddy uh was
like late last summer we started like
thinking about this and working on it um
and the the thing is is like getting at
this data is like very difficult um it's
not impossible you but you can do it
like local real estate agents they can
figure this out um they can go into like
uh and and get the mortgage level data
from you know whatever the County
website might be um but it's it's time
consuming you know it'll take you a
couple minutes to look up each property
rather than being to see like a full
view like oh these are all the ones you
know so you're taking something that's
you know hours potentially down to you
know seconds um but that comes at a you
know uh being bootstrapped uh comes at a
cost in terms of like the data Fidelity
that we are able to offer people um and
that's something that we're like
actively working on because um we've
realized that like the the data piece is
you know a big portion of it and so we
were like okay what's kind of like you
know effective to get us to an MVP type
you know offering and I mean people have
clearly responded it's it's enough

[37:01]
clearly responded it's it's enough
information for you to move uh forward
kind of like um just knowing the
particulars of that loan and you can see
the rest on like Zillow you can go look
at it right it's you know it takes two
seconds and I I assume that was for a
reason I'm not I'm not criticizing that
strategy I'm just trying to fully
understand how it works sure so because
I have it pulled up now as if I'm a
consumer so you click assume this home
and that is basically a consumer telling
you uh that they want to learn more
about about that home and then they're
led to a type form right and they they
put they put in their info and I'm doing
this now so you're going to see a lead
for me um just trying to see how it
works I'm a
buyer uh do we have a real estate agent
so if the answer is yes what does that
do to and and are you are you generating
Revenue by just referring leads to real
estate agent for percentage of their
commission yeah so so so that's that's a
portion of what happens and then we you
know we we get you know a piece of that
from our real estate Partners um it is

[38:00]
from our real estate Partners um it is
the case that like certain you know
people have come in and they're like
well I already have an agent and we're
like okay yeah sure no problem like hey
you know if at any point um you know
once you guys are under contract on that
particular home go aad and like you know
give us a call there's also a page on
our website if you want to do like the
Assumption management it's right up
there on the services tab I think it
says assumption management I always
forget the wording but um and then that
you know will'll plug you in with our uh
folks that know the assumable process
really well
pardon um and they'll help you you know
process that like I said on kind of an
you know as expediently as possible okay
so if I don't have an agent then you're
sending that to an
agent what if I what if I do have an
agent if you do have an agent like
that's you know that's fine or whatever
um you know at that point uh if it's not
an agent that we previously worked with
we're like hey if you guys have any
questions we're you know the whole point
of we started this um you know making
money was kind of like a secondary
consideration we were like let's make
this information like out let's get this

[39:01]
this information like out let's get this
information out there you know
information wants to be free and so um
but if you already have one we're like
okay great you know at that point now
you know the particulars of that
property and you you know you have the
information to go to that seller and say
hey I noticed that you know this uh this
mortgage is assumable I'd love to do
that and then you know if you guys you
found value from the website or what
then they could come back engage us for
the Assumption and then we also you know
get you know paid on that
okay okay so back to the data fidelity
thing the reason and let me tell me if
this is wrong the reason that I can't
see the info when I click assume this
home it's because like you've got to go
fetch that info
right yeah well and so the yeah kind of
like product road map type Vision um is
to make it kind of you know uh to to
gain parody with you know your Zillow
your redins your um you know those are
hundred million doll you know billion
dollar companies out there and you know
me and uh my buddy bootstrapping this so

[40:01]
me and uh my buddy bootstrapping this so
it's it's about like having the data
provider that can actually give you all
that information and so you make
trade-offs in terms of like do you want
to spend I I don't know if you've looked
at like buying data from you know like a
core logic or something like that um but
uh it's it gets like very expensive very
quickly yeah yeah yeah okay so once a
consumer submits a lead um you you get
going on the back end do you get going
at uh reaching out to the consumer or to
a realtor in that area first yeah so
they they they make uh they make contact
with the uh with the consumer you know
confirm all the details and then they
make a warm handoff to that agent who's
going to be Downstream okay okay have
you thought about um shortening the the
cycle of generating a or of of getting
that lead within type form of just like
getting their first name and phone or
first name email and phone
or yeah we we've tried a a few different
things my my co-founder is a a marketer

[41:01]
things my my co-founder is a a marketer
by trade and he's like you know always
you know kind of testing these different
things the the issues I think that we're
having uh in the business are are not
related to like actual lead generation I
think that that's something that we're
you know we are literally you know week
over week month over month day over day
like setting records like I think I
think like Monday this week um we had we
had a record day in the turn in the
number of leads that we passed off and
we're like what you know what what
happened our traffic blew up like we
don't and some of it's attributable to
you know folks like yourself who just
you know kind of uh you know may say
something about consumables and and our
SEO is very good uh we got the we got
the name which is nice um and so like
that that's not the part that we're
worried about we're you know now we're
thinking about kind of like Downstream
ways that we can like you know help
agents uh become you know a little bit
more informed so that it's so that they
can manage expectations for their buyers
and their sellers you know more
appropriately and kind of serve them in

[42:00]
appropriately and kind of serve them in
a better way um to make the transaction
more likely to be
successful okay
so can you explain that in a in a more
simple way like your your bottleneck
specifically
is what is getting like getting the
transactions done
because um folks haven't you know assuma
bles haven't been a thing since like
basically like the 80s um and so um
everyone who has done them uh has more
or less like aged out like they they
they get processed from time to time I
think like the numbers for the last two
years were you know something like 3,
3600 something like that um they they're
not big numbers um you know in the past
because it just hasn't been something
that you know right has been something
that's super valuable to do and now that
it is you know and both on the buy and
the sell side right like buyers going to
be able to afford more home um because
the payment's not going to you know be
crushing them uh but and then the you
know um depending on how you think about

[43:00]
know um depending on how you think about
it you know with rates having risen as
much as they have um like prices on
Helms should be down significantly more
than they are but like you have all
these Supply constraints right and so
sellers don't want to like give up on
getting the number that they see on
their estimate and so like the assuma
bles are a way to get it done um but
it's like slightly more complicated and
people just aren't super comfortable
advising our clients on it and so that's
that's the big thing I think that we've
been running into kind of Education to
the Realtors so they can educate their
clients in an accurate way about how it
works 100% yeah do you have any stories
of how this is Illustrated perfectly
like all right we had this one client we
had a realtor and it just fell apart
because of x y and
z um well I mean that's like that's been
the the feedback that we've gotten from
like the all the agents that we've
gotten feedback from they're like you
know awesome lead quality because we do
you know because we have that little bit
longer lead form we collect that
information like down payment right so
we can kind of s you know we know that

[44:01]
we can kind of s you know we know that
we've got good high quality leads
because uh I think that the average um
down payment of the folks that are
coming through our site is like you know
125 something like that uh thousand in
down payment and so like being able to
pass on like those really strong leads
that's not really the problem right the
thing that we're hearing back from
Agents is that these listing agents um
they kind of get the sense that that
they might have heard like a a horror
story or something like that or or they
just have you know kind of a dated
appreciation for how quickly these
transactions can happen so they're like
this is gonna take six months and it's
like like 60 days so there's kind of a
dichotomy the realtor are like wow this
is a great lead thank you so much but
also I don't know what to do with this
and I is this a scam like they don't
even know enough about consumables to
really sell it to their
client well like we Pro so we provided
them with with a lot of material um and
we actually we you know the the real
estate partner that we have um because
we kind of you know have approached this

[45:00]
we kind of you know have approached this
this whole you know business from the
perspective of like okay let's focus on
you know what makes our beer taste
better uh and let's figure out you know
partners and folks that are actually
going to be able to do you know the real
estate part The Lending part we're also
um we are about to announce well not
like officially but like we have lending
Partners who are going to be able to
like Le lend in that second position to
make that down payment not so big so
like say you can bring you know 80k but
need 150k to make like the the equity
Gap work between the purchase price and
the amount on on the loan we're going to
be able to lend on that now and yeah
it's going to be at like nine n and a
half 10 percent but the Blended rate
with like a 3% is going to be
significantly better still and
worthwhile going through kind of the
headache of doing that um so but the the
the thing that we've heard back from
these these Buyer Agents the most is
like hey great quality lead the problem
that we're running into is that these
listing agents like just kind of don't
get it yet and they frankly don't
realize like what an asset they're
sitting on from like a listing

[46:01]
sitting on from like a listing
perspective like it's a total
differentiator and it makes it stand out
you know in terms of um hey like you
know I know this house is $600,000 just
like the one next to it the one next to
it but uh this one you can actually
assume and you can you know it's much
more affordable than going out and
getting a brand new R and so we're like
that's the the part that we're running
up against right now is is trying to
help you know listing agents understand
that spec okay so the buyer agents are
are fine they're on board with it but
they're trying to convince the listing
agent that what they have is different
and unique and so they should basically
consider their offer more than than a a
competing offer sure yeah
okay now how long have you been at this
like how how old is the oldest good lead
that you've received and what happen
leads yeah so we we uh we launched the
platform uh February 5th um in this

[47:01]
platform uh February 5th um in this
current iteration we went through like a
whole like Google Chrome extension thing
that just like sat on top of Zillow
which was not as successful and then we
were like okay we actually have to
figure out another way to approach this
um and like we we've had a handful of of
of these leads like actually go through
like conventional transactions um and
we're still you know kind of fighting to
get that that same kind of uptake on the
assumable side did you not get paid on
the conventional
transactions it's so it's a master
listing agreement that our real estate
Partners sign with it so it's basically
however uh our Master referral agreement
so however that transaction gets done
you know our real estate Partners get
paid on it and then we would get paid as
well but have you gotten paid on a
completed transaction even if it wasn't
assumable yeah yeah okay so what you're
seeing is because of this friction and
confusion between the listing agent and
the and the the buyer agent
a lot of these are either just falling
off or they're just closing a

[48:00]
off or they're just closing a
traditional mortgage and not using your
platform right yeah right that's yeah
kind of does it make a difference to you
if they if they get a traditional
mortgage as far as revenue is
concerned uh no I I mean I once
um at some point right uh if they you
know once like the lending product is
fully you know baked in um like we'll be
able to get like points on that or
referrals from that um and you know if
they go out and get like brand new
lending you know then then that's a
conversation to have too
um yeah how much how much revenue are
you receiving on average for deals that
you've
closed uh it's like in the like single
digit thousands yeah low low single
digit thousands so it's predicated right
on on you know um percentage of their
commission yeah right sure okay let me
ask you this like sure does it does it

[49:00]
ask you this like sure does it does it
matter does it matter that they're
getting traditional mortgages and that
there's this friction in the education
process or is this kind of like an
ethical bait and switch where PE people
come to your website wanting an
assumable mortgage you match them with a
realtor they're wanting an assumable
mortgage and because of some idiot
listing agent they're not able to get
that assumable mortgage by no fault of
yours but they still get a mortgage and
you still get paid is that is that too
simplistic
I mean like that's certainly like could
be the case and I I think that could be
the case you know uh like with any like
lead generating service or whatever but
um you know our preference right with is
and the whole reason we started this was
to try to help people you know um and
actually my co-founder found a property
on our on our site and is assuming a
home he's moving from Phoenix to San
Antonio and he's assuming a home in you
know in the San Anon area that he found
on our site and he's using he's you know
really we're eating our own dog food in
that regard and so um like we we know it
can be done and we know how to do it um

[50:02]
can be done and we know how to do it um
it's just right you know there's there's
this like Gap right now because um
agents haven't really you know kind of
caught up to like hey this is actually
like not just something weird that I
should shun and like not try to like uh
you know get good at it's like a great
opportunity to become like that person
for whatever your Market is have you
made like a 60-second video explaining
how it works like just very very simply
have you ever done that yeah we we have
yeah um and like what we found uh
because I um like I I answer all of the
emails that that come through so if you
if anybody sends something into that
contact us form I'm usually responding
and I try to you know try to respond
very quickly um I I mean that's like
we're we're you know in the New York
Times and uh and um have talked with
some of the bigger platforms too and
they just like sent us something on the
contact form because they're like we
couldn't find you guys so we just like
sent your contact form and you know
they're always impressed that we respond
very quickly um and uh

[51:02]
very quickly um and uh
it's the thing that I've realized in
like going through I mean tons like we
get agents reaching out to us we get you
know consumers reaching out to us um you
know folks who want to partner with us
on on this or that portion of of the
business um there's like so little that
people are actually going through our
site and like looking at any like they
they they kind of like sort of get the
concept and they're like I'll ask a
question but like no one going through
like the frequently asked questions uh
they're just like I just want to talk to
somebody who's going to answer my
question for me and you know at least
right now um it's a lot but you know
have capacity to uh answer all of those
you know questions directly um kind of
taking taking a page out of uh moi's uh
you know native uh plan of like hey
until you get to a certain point like as
the founder like you should be seeing
everything that comes in see all the
problems so that you can actually like
adapt and and try to make fixes and so
that's something that was kind of core
Ross people don't read and right that's

[52:01]
Ross people don't read and right that's
why I suggested a video right like I
feel like if you were to make a very Tik
Tock style short like a literal short
that's not really you I mean you could
post it but that's not the purpose the
purpose is to ask the the agent that
you're referring to to send it to the
listing agent like right away and like
some sort of call to action and then
some sort of an automated zapier
followup where you're asking the agent
incessantly like did you send the video
did you send the video and maybe a
tracking system where you can make sure
that the video is watched right um I I
look at this like I look at my mining
Syndicate where we sell Bitcoin miners
our biggest competition is education and
convincing people that we're not a scam
and the only way that we've been over
able to overcome that is very unscalable
and that's hopping like giving physical
tours which is not relevant for you and
hopping on zooms with people and then
once we do that the close rate is like
80%
and we can get like 90% of the way of

[53:00]
and we can get like 90% of the way of
the way to that 80% if we just do a
webinar and that's in in a way that's
even more social proof because they see
other people in the webinar and their
strength and numbers and so depending on
your lead volume I mean you could even
do this like have you ever heard of
webinars that are they're not live like
they appear live but they're not yeah
just a asynchronous yeah yeah like an
Asing webinar you could have a daily one
that these Realtors join at any given
time and they can see like a live count
of everyone who's ever been in it asking
questions and whatnot maybe even have
someone on the back end answering those
in real time and I just I feel like you
need to give them a packet with
different multimedia formats right like
they're like from least to most friction
and also from least tactical to most
tactical and so it's like back to my
mining syndic example we recently had
this huge conversion of platforms and it
was a big deal and I AB tested the

[54:00]
was a big deal and I AB tested the
emails that we sent out and one email
explained everything we were doing in
detail and the other one just said like
three sentence like we're switching
platforms uh let us know if you have any
questions here's a blog post and the
blog post was basically a copy paste of
that long email and 90% of people just
they weren't ever going to read the blog
post they didn't want to they didn't
care they just kind of wanted to know
the tldr of it and so right I I would
just have like a welcome packet with you
know a 30 second video first and then
maybe like a three minute video second
with even more detail and then maybe
like a link to the webinar and then
maybe a link to the FAQs and just set up
a ton of Z zapier automations to the
listing agent or to the the Buyer Agents
where you're just pestering them to
death hey did you send it did you send
it or just get the buyer agent info and
you just send it directly to them like I
know this sounds like a scam but it was
really popular in the 70s but we have
had low rates for a long time so it
doesn't make sense but now it actually
does make sense a lot of people don't
think it's possible but it is possible
it's actually life changing you could
save $ th a month like go through all

[55:00]
save $ th a month like go through all
that and they just just push that packet
on them to no end with like tracking all
over that so then you can start to see
all right everyone's clicking on the
fourth option even though we thought
they'd all click on the video let's put
the fourth option to the top it kind of
reminds me of of Link tree where I have
a link Tree on Twitter and I'm like all
right I want everyone to go to my
personal website first and then I'll put
co-founders decom fifth and then then
after a month I can see man Even though
co-founders decom is fifth they're all
clicking on that so I'm just going to
make it easier for them I'm going to put
that first right you're just kind of got
it you're throwing a lot at them and
then letting the data speak for itself
and adjusting
accordingly because it's it's it's hard
to give advice of like how you can
educate someone that's like two degrees
of separation away from you and so all I
can do is kind of relate to my own
experiences and companies like uber and
Airbnb that sounded like a scam at first
and the only way Airbnb really fixed

[56:01]
and the only way Airbnb really fixed
that is just by time you know and
letting it become more acceptable and
removing friction and just doing the
type of stuff that we're talking about
now that makes sense yeah no it's it's
it's an interesting yeah that's an
interesting take we had we hadn't
considered okay well I I hope it's
helpful um it seems like you're doing
something awesome so I'd love to hear uh
a followup how it goes yeah for sure
I'll uh yeah I would love to come back
on uh six months hence uh and have close
a lot more transactions for folks yeah I
would love that as
well all right
man all right brother man cheers thanks
appreciate it yep thanks for calling see
you
bye Jake hey Chris how are you good how
are you man I'm doing well happy Friday
happy Friday and Daniel I see you in the
lobby by the way and you are next up so
don't leave me um all right Jake do you

[57:02]
don't leave me um all right Jake do you
mind if I just get into your question
real quick and you can tell me if
there's any context 100% all right let
me navigate over to
it all right you asked in your
experience what have you found to be the
best way to source and find Stellar GMS
operators and to corrent correctly
incentivize them assuming no equity so
why don't you tell me like the business
that you're in the industry that you're
in and the specific problem that you're
having around that question yeah so um
the question I think deres more from my
experience even in the the corporate
world um the W2 space is that you know I
found a lack of um direct incentives um
you know to go the extra mile and
whatnot um feels like you know generally
speaking people are uh vying for you
know people's approval um almost being
uh rewarded in AAR if you will uh with
no direct uh you know compensation or uh

[58:02]
no direct uh you know compensation or uh
incentive to be placed um so now I'm I'm
starting businesses and whatnot and and
and making the leap into
entrepreneurship uh I've got a pool
coining company on the side here that's
uh doing pretty well um and as that
grows you know I'm looking to um hire on
staff and whatnot and you know I want to
take my dissatisfaction with the the
commonplace um lack of incentive and
Implement That Into You Know my business
and then future businesses that I start
um and I I think you know assuming not
being part of the capital stack I was
just curious as to you know your
experience um if there's oneoff um you
know incentives that you've placed or or
found that worked best um to make sure
that you and your GM or owner or manager
whoever it may be are uh singing from
the same sheet of music as they say
so yeah I like it so let's talk more
specifically so you're asking about your
pool cleaning business and are you

[59:01]
pool cleaning business and are you
thinking of hiring your first GM for
that that's correct yeah so I mean I'm
in Michigan so it's a very seasonal
business obviously um and you know I'm
starting to step away from a full-time
W2 and I've actually worked out a pretty
creative solution to afford myself some
more time start to grow this um more and
then start to look to start other
businesses in the uh fall and winter um
but yes to answer your question yeah
you're correct yeah why don't you tell
me about what you already like the idea
you already have for this guy and do you
have a person picked out yet or are you
still too early on in the process do not
um and and candidly I mean I'm still
learning the business and and foresee
myself uh being the owner operator for
the the duration of the summer here um
really building up that Client List get
a good foundation and then you know next
year um you know jumping off the launch
pad so to speak and um hiring out that
work and and bringing on some some help
so
now what will the GM be doing if it's
not cleaning pools directly or is that

[1:00:01]
not cleaning pools directly or is that
what he'll be doing so that's to it's a
it's a little bit of a craw walk around
if you will um so definitely going to
start to clean pools um because I've
already got a decent uh client base
built up and I assume that to grow
throughout the summer so the the the GM
uh will start cleaning pools but as that
list grows and then uh hiring out techs
underneath um Etc uh that's kind of the
plan right now so when you say GM you
mean like a I mean CEO sounds too formal
because it's a small business but he's
gonna be in charge of the whole thing
you're just like check oper
operationally wise so like a CO if if
that I guess makes more more sense um
you know still heavily involved being
myself uh on the business side of things
um you know being the CEO and then more
or less hiring not the COO if you will
yeah and would you just be growing the
business and doing marketing is that the
type of stuff you enjoy more yes 100% um
I'm in the asset management space of a

[1:01:01]
I'm in the asset management space of a
real estate uh family office right now
so that's more or less and and what I
really enjoy doing but want to be doing
it for myself uh so yeah and do you plan
to quit your job for this uh I'm already
starting to uh I've actually worked out
a solution with them that I'll be piring
back to uh part-time in definitely um
and then you know so that that provides
some some good cash flow in interim and
could pay rent and whatnot amongst
ambiguity but uh yes to to answer your
question I plan on making a a leap of
faith here very shortly okay so let's
let's talk hypotheticals let's say gun
to your head someone approaches you and
you you have to hire a GM tomorrow and
you have to incentivize him how do you
structure it today and then maybe I can
help you work with that logic yeah
so personally I think I mean assuming
not anywhere in the capital stack uh
I would Implement some sort of a profit
sharing plan um with you know defined

[1:02:02]
sharing plan um with you know defined
hurdles um of X growth or X dollars
whatever it may be um to and that's on a
monthly basis right or a weekly basis
even um because the last thing I want to
do is is kind of have it evolve into the
traditional year-end review like how do
you do and hope that I give you your
bonus or whatever um I want them to take
part in in in the in the success of the
business on a dayto day um and not have
to like sit down and be like oh you did
X Y and Z it's it's defined um you know
you accomplished uh the goals that we
had set out for you and you were
compensated almost instantaneously for
that and so I think a profit sharing
plan is probably what I would do right
now um you know be creative about that
uh so they can take part in the the
success or or immediate success of the
company would you want them to try to
help grow the the company as well um
so ideally sure um but you know for

[1:03:02]
so ideally sure um but you know for
defining the scope of what you know I
really want them to do is just drive
operations um deliver on a day-to-day
basis you know our our mission and and
the provide excellent customer service
and then I can take more of the role of
um you know Outreach growing marketing
to your point um it's just that right
now I don't have time to do all said um
but uh
yeah to answer your
question if you could choose would you
rather do like a a flat salary plus
commission or all or one of the other of
the two I would I would rather them have
to get in the game um and you are
directly compensated for how hard and
how you work and your success within the
company so commission only specifically
uh I I guess ideally yeah but uh you
know that's might not be the attractive
uh if you don't have true equity in in
the company right um so it would

[1:04:01]
the company right um so it would
probably be a hourly or a salary um type
or deal with a additional kicker on the
top and it's just kind of identifying
what that kicker really looks like yeah
okay so I this is a great question I I
have a lot of thoughts around incentives
and commissions and flat salary yeah I
notice that oftentimes there can be a an
inverse incentive so to to speak if you
are are look and I know you're not
married to this so don't don't if if
you're if you were to seek out someone
only for commission only I feel like a
lot of times that can attract people
that you don't want for sure people that
maybe don't have experience they don't
have anything better right so it's kind
of like h no one else will hire me what
do I have to lose here right um when
that does work I feel like that works
best when it's that's what the industry
calls for like let's say it's uh like
life insurance and that's industry
standard is to be commission only and
maybe you're bringing a book of business

[1:05:01]
maybe you're bringing a book of business
over and you're sharing it
7525 and that's industry standard and
you're just bringing a killer and you're
saying to the killer hey instead of 6040
let's do 50/50 because you're a killer Y
and he's like cool it's commission only
but I know day one I'm gonna be making
175 because I'm bringing over what I'm
making 155 on today right right I in my
experience for this type of work what
works best is
a like a below Market flat salary and a
commission that will get them above
Market um so let's say I'm just going to
make up numbers let's say you're doing
$10,000 a month Topline and you know
what your margins are and you can afford
to pay a 20% commission so two grand a
month Y and Market salary for this is 70
grand so you're GNA pay him 50 Grand and
he's gonna be like oh but you know he
knows that on day one his commission is
going to bring him to 74 Grand or
whatever it is y right and so he's like

[1:06:01]
whatever it is y right and so he's like
excited and I would I would always tie
growth into the commission even if
you're planning on doing the growing
because he's out there in the field at
least to start I know he won't be
forever but he's going to develop skills
that he'll be able to pass on to his
field teexs as you guys grow and that
skill might just be saying hi to the
neighbor as he pulls in and then you
know developing an off-hand conversation
with a neighbor that might turn into
another job right um a lot of times if
you if you talk to a guy that's a tech
that's not used to sales and you talk
about commission based on growth he's
goingon to bristle thinking that you're
asking him to go make cold calls or stop
knocking out doors but a lot of times
it's just like a spontaneous
conversation with the homeowner and all
he has to say is offhand hey like do you
know any anyone else that needs pool
cleaning oh actually you know it's like
very low pressure right in his in his
mind
um that's not selling right he just
doesn't understand what selling is it's

[1:07:00]
doesn't understand what selling is it's
just it's so effective to tie a Tex
commission to sales and growth because
being out there in the Branded shirt in
the wp truck that's the person that's
most likely to actually close a deal
more so than even you sitting in the
office just because he's out there doing
it you know y um so I would tie it maybe
two different commission tiers one one
very conservative and that's just for
keeping going what you have y right and
it's just like all right dude we're
doing 10 grand a month I'm going to give
you 20% of that and that's going to get
you to 74 which is a little bit above
Market but here's the thing that's only
20% if you go get the neighbor I'm gonna
give you um 100% of the first month or
of the first three months because at
that point you know that your churn is
like 4% and that person's going to stay
for years so whatever and so now in his
mind if you tie the commission to like
I'm going to give you 5% a month for
every month that that that customer's in
business it's like H it's an extra 50

[1:08:01]
business it's like H it's an extra 50
bucks a month yeah but if it's like hey
I'm gonna give you
$400 every time you just mention offand
do you know of anyone else and they say
yes that's that's 400 bucks that might
be what he's making every week right now
right and so it all comes down to
framing it and so you always want to
find that balance between um a structure
that can protect you in case just goes
crazy and starts selling a ton and you
find yourself broke and a a structure
that's generous and simple agre because
like it's really easy to be like man
keep it simple but simple can really
screw you if he does nothing or does too
much right and it's also really easy to
say all right here's what you got to do
you got to do earnout over time it's got
to tear down to a threshold that you
just have to find yeah yeah too much
friction right um so that's I'm a I
you're asking the right question because
most people aren't thinking of
incentives at all they're like oh Market

[1:09:00]
incentives at all they're like oh Market
70k I'm gonna pay him 70k commissions
are everything or sorry incentives are
everything you know Charlie Munger
always talks about it he like if if
you're not thinking about incentives
right now like like even if you think
about incentives all day you're not
thinking about it enough right enough
yeah well and it's interesting I guess
it's just a Forefront of my mind
especially as you know I start
businesses and I start growing these
businesses to where I might be
disconnected from
are very disconnected from the
day-to-day operations and to and still
or be able to sleep at night that you
know your brand is being um represented
well and they have um reason to
represent the brand well and whatnot um
I think is the the utmost precedence uh
to be honest with you um and I know I'm
not the only one who thinks about you
know why am I not getting paid extra for
working on the weekend or um Etc um
whatever you may have it uh in the W2
space especially but uh yeah so have you
had I guess as a followup um or the

[1:10:00]
had I guess as a followup um or the
first part of the question it's very
broad stroke but the uh the sourcing and
finding of of Stellar guys or or girls
um that you found or or Outlets or um
you know the vetting process as a whole
I don't just any experience of um you
know finding the the studs out there
yeah honestly the the most luck we've
had in finding this type of position
position has been indeed it's very it's
like right in front of your face I'm not
telling anything you don't already know
but paying for indeed uh like there's
the free version and the paid version
allocating four to 500 bucks to
applications and then just making it a
numbers game you're gonna you're GNA
come across good guys also I would just
drive around your area and when you see
any sort of a a crew like a tree crew or
lawn or whatever I would just pull over
and talk to him like Hey man like what
do you oh okay and just kind of kind of
fake like you're just a curious but very
friendly homeowner and then start like

[1:11:02]
friendly homeowner and then start like
how long have you been working this job
okay oh seven years okay seven years
means he's probably really good at this
okay yeah and just like those unscalable
things and you already said this
yourself are often lead to the best
people for sure yeah um but otherwise
indeed works great yeah cool well um
can't thank you or can't thank you
enough for for having me out here and
responding to a hell of a cold DM there
but uh no you're you're you're uh you're
a rockstar and you're inspiring uh a lot
of people out there including myself so
um can't thank you enough and uh I
appreciate your time today yeah thank
you Jake of course have a good day you
as well take care see
you all right thank okay Daniel also say
uh Colin you're up next so Colin and I
talked last week but we didn't get to

[1:12:00]
talked last week but we didn't get to
everything so don't leave me Callin uh
Daniel how are you I'm good I'm doing
good how come I'm like I'm I'm funny
over here like you see me yeah I can oh
okay there's another guy that just says
connecting okay fine I just got this
percentage thing saying
83 okay fine yeah what's you're good
okay so let me do you mind if I just
kind of recap your question and then we
can go yeah of course yeah get out of
that light yeah okay all right so what
you
said is give me just a
[Music]
sec all right I have a business I own
and work at full-time it is set up as a
high touch service heavy business I
would like to buy another business that
I can use to increase my income since my
current business takes up so much of my
day what type of business should I be
looking for so I'd love to hear about
your current business more okay I
thought so I thought you I could talk

[1:13:01]
thought so I thought you I could talk
forever about like any business owner
can talk forever um basically it's a
print shop that's the the you know the
forward- facing
um forward facing uh type of business
but we really specialize only in
printing for wedding Bar Mitzvah and
similar events that's it um here and
there I'll get other things from people
that are my customers besides or a shop
nearby or something like that but
basically that's it that's all we do we
know what the the event planners want we
know how to design it the right way um
other print shops that just do
commercial things they don't know
necessarily how to design it the way
that the event planners like it um they
don't stock the funny papers the you
know the blush pinks and the metallic
taes all the different things they like
we have those in stock all the time and
um we have some specialty capabilities
that a standard printing business might
not have like hot foil
um we can print in white ink I'm trying
to think some other things um we have
on-site die cutting some places send

[1:14:00]
on-site die cutting some places send
that kind of thing out so we have all
the things that we need to produce
things for weddings and we focus on that
um we I mean me it's B it's basically
just me um and you're in Brooklyn yes in
Brooklyn yeah okay so we um we are able
to to get a higher margin because
everything for a wedding is always U
always gets a always gets a A markup
that other other things don't you know
what service or product you're providing
and printing is no different and um the
downside of it is that you're dealing
with a lot of last minute things a lot
like right now I'm dealing with orders
that came yesterday and a little bit
today for weddings that are on Monday on
Memorial Day um so a whole bunch of
things things that have to get done and
uh in a short amount of time and that's
why I'm here all the time I'm basically
here 14 15 hours a day the rest of the
time I'm either with my family or doing
other different obligations that I have
and how how long have you been working
that
much that many hours yeah um let me try

[1:15:00]
much that many hours yeah um let me try
to think so this year will be two years
since I let this guy go and before that
at least at least three years it's been
like this um I had a really great
employee before covid during covid
immediately after covid but then he said
you know I could move someplace else and
get the same apartment for about a third
of the price so that's what he's goingon
to do and since then I've had a couple
people that are not just not competent
enough and um I found that I'm paying
them but I'm still coming back at night
so um there's no point like when I had
the other guy it really took a load off
and it was just it was so much easier
but then after I lost him it's hard to
get people to to work here that either
they're overqualified and they think
that oh this is so easy printing is just
you know control P file print what's the
big deal or they're underqualified and
and you know they're watching Netflix
while they're doing the work and then I
see it afterwards and I got to fix it
all or things like that it's just not

[1:16:02]
all or things like that it's just not
it's not it's hard to find a good fit
that's the thing with with uh with this
type of business okay so you've been
working this hard for two to three years
how long have you been in business and
what is your annual revenue like I've
been in business for about 10 years a
little more than 10 years 10 and a half
years um I think I took this over from
the previous person November so it's
almost about 10 and a half years
um my annual revenues are about
650 700 something like that and um but
because of the high margin I'm able to
take home a substantial portion of that
so my income is good but um I could
always I need more let's put it that way
definitely need more and when you said
take over did you buy this or what was
that process 10 years ago it's
interesting my mother-in-law had this
business but not at the same um the
same uh it wasn't as built out as what I
have now she had it and she was using it
just as a business to print addresses on

[1:17:02]
just as a business to print addresses on
envelopes guest addresses and that is a
high margin um service and after a few
years of my being married she said you
know what maybe your wife wants to come
work with me we'll expand the business
and after it did they took it they
expanded it to offer everything but most
of the work was brokered and when I took
it over she called me one day and she
said she wants me to take it over she
can't handle it anymore she'll give it
to me debt free I just walk in it's all
mine I can do whatever I want I didn't
have to pay for it um so I was like yeah
I was just like why not let's give this
a shot so I was able to expand what we
offer recalibrate pricing to where we
actually make money I brought a lot of
processes in house um and it's been good
you know every year we've seen growth
every single year last year was our best
year ever um this year we're a little
off on the numbers I'm not sure why
every month um our revenues have been
down but I'm still able to to take the
same salary so I think I'm making that's
another thing I just don't have my
numbers really tight like I know my
revenues and I keep track of that for

[1:18:01]
revenues and I keep track of that for
sales tax but I don't have a a good
handle on my numbers but I know I'm able
to comfortably take my salary and I I've
never had to carry a balance on a credit
card um I have no debt in the business
except for the leas machines because
with printing a lot of equipment is
leased because you lease it for five
years and then the company gives you
another one takes that one off your
hands you know gives you a new one and
that way you constantly have new equip
so I have no actual debt like I have no
um small business loan I have no credit
card debt I have no um um no debt yeah
so it's been it's really been it's
working out okay do you have any
employees um I have my sister-in-law
comes in for about four hours a day
three days a week sorry four days a week
four hours a day four days a week to do
some graphic design but I don't I don't
need her to come in I'm I'm able to do
it all by myself um but it's my
sister-in-law and I got the business
from my mother-in-law I feel a little
bit of obligation to Keep Her On she's
going to be leaving soon and I'm going
to use that to further automate some

[1:19:02]
to use that to further automate some
processes here like the money I'm going
to save from that to further automate
some things here that are taking taking
a lot of my time and um I don't really
need a designer because so many things
are templated so many of the designs I
have templates for and it takes me it
take me five minutes to design something
that takes for a half hour to design so
I'm able to really do it all um not do I
can't I can't really do it all myself
but I'm able I'm able to hold it down um
I able to hold it down yeah are you are
you purposely trying to grow right now
or are you just getting business because
of your
reputation
um right right now in immediate like
immediately short term I I am trying to
find some new people um until for the
last couple years I've had good
customers and I haven't needed to expand
and I've been I've been looking like
over the last couple years we've been
I've been experimenting with some
different things like I tried to say you
know let's move out of New York let's go
someplace else buy a different business
that's more 9 to5 UM and after a couple

[1:20:02]
that's more 9 to5 UM and after a couple
years they trying to get my wife to do
that it wasn't it wasn't in the cards so
that's done then I was trying to figure
out a way to take this to more of a
commercial Direction and hire somebody
and to work with me and we'll do more
Commercial Printing to minimize our
hours um in the store and that didn't
work for whatever reason I could not get
the commercial business even as my
regular business increased I couldn't
get the regular Commercial Printing and
finally I decided you know it's sort of
like from God this way like I'm getting
these customers I know what I'm doing
why am I trying to force it to be
something else so I've doubled down on
on this I tried to um you know the dozen
or so party planners I tried to figure
out what they want that they're not
getting from me they're getting
elsewhere um and I've got a couple
things in the works to add to my my
business but um the the other thing I
noticed over the last six months two or
three people have stopped ordering
almost completely and they just tell me
the reason they stopped ordering is
because they haven't had business I see
on social media they do have business
I'm not sure what that means

[1:21:00]
I'm not sure what that means
everything's really been good I don't
know what when you say people you mean
party planners those are like yeah party
planners event planners yeah I sort of
have a dozen that come um um a couple
times a month and they spend a few
thousand dollars each time and it it
works out and then I have a couple
customers that then I have sorry General
customers that come for invitations and
things like that but the the main the
the core of the business is working with
the event planner and turning things
around in 24 48 Hours things like that
okay so I haven't been trying to grow
that but I want to replace those people
yeah I'm really trying to to to get to a
point where I can sell this business and
just wash my hands of it um because
because um I I really I put way too much
of myself into it like I I can't do
something you know in sort of a half
measure um I have to do it
110% and because of that I'm here all
the time and I I just I can't I need
something I'm a little have a little
more distance and um and I haven't been
able to do that with this business so I

[1:22:00]
able to do that with this business so I
want to start you know with the other
business like I like I was asking in the
question buy another business start to
build that up and eventually get to the
point where I can sell this because my
take-home is is high enough that I I can
get a nice number for this business it's
just that um it's just that I don't have
another thing to replace my income
that's the problem all right so if your
take-home is high enough to where you
could sell this business for a good
price it's it's also high enough to
where you could hire someone right like
a replacement so it's interesting it's
interesting so I take home 250,000 a
year but I need that money um we have
religious school tuition and just so
many you know the mortgage and so many
other things so I'm not able to pay
anyone because sort of what happened was
I expanded the business and didn't pay
attention to the fact that I needed more
money I could have hired someone a
little earlier I think because right now
I can't I I don't have any extra money
to hire somebody that that's that's my
feeling maybe if I got more organized I

[1:23:00]
feeling maybe if I got more organized I
would see that I had more money but um
but I don't feel like I have I have
enough money to hire somebody else at
least not full-time what people have
been suggesting is do part-time the
problem with hiring someone parttime is
you don't know which parttime because
jobs will come out of nowhere like
Wednesday I didn't even know I had this
job that's taking me you know four or
five hours to do and now I have the job
so I I don't really know like I need
someone that I can just call oh come
down I have a couple hours today or
tomorrow I I don't I can't find someone
like that so I'm trying to keep it in a
steady state where I'm able to still
make the same amount of money but build
something else on the side where in the
next three four years I could sell this
that that's that's what I really want to
do I just I i' I've sort of had enough
giving I've been there I I've been there
you're you're in like that messy Middle
where you feel trapped right like yes
yes you feel like I can't like I don't
have enough to hire but I have too much
where I'm like golden handcuffed to this
business um it's hard to make a move in

[1:24:02]
business um it's hard to make a move in
the place that you're in without some
level of Faith right like and I don't
mean that in the religious sense I mean
that in the oh I'm ready to take a risk
I'm totally ready to take a risk I I
have no problem I will take a loan I
because as terrifying as it is it's it's
far more terrifying to me to be in the
same place in 10 years like I I can't do
that like I I I'm scared to to take a
loan scared to buy business but I'm far
more terrified of being exactly where I
am now 10 years from that I I can't I
can't handle that that's not a good that
wouldn't I mean this sounds harsh but
I'm glad you're terrified because that's
the opposite of complacent right you're
not complacent and so you're thinking do
I sell this business or do I double that
in this business both of them are going
to take a leap of faith into the unknown
right right you said you had a comment
earlier where it's like let's let's find
a business that that could act more of
like a 9et to-5 but honestly some indust
might make it easier to be more like a
95 but a quote I heard recently was a
graveyard is full of Irreplaceable men

[1:25:02]
graveyard is full of Irreplaceable men
right like any task can be outsourced
some are harder to Outsource um some
make you feel more uncomfortable but
really anything can be outsourced and
you've done it you've done it yourself
you had a rockar and then they left
um it how if someone let's say someone
came to you right now and said I um I'll
give you 750 for your business three
times earnings uh but I I don't want to
run it what would you do because you're
the one running it right like how how is
it sellable today if you want to sell it
if you don't have anyone working for you
really right that that that is a good
point um I never even thought about that
um I never thought about that that's a
good point if I don't have anyone else
working here who's going to buy it right
exactly like you're you're selling
you're selling a job and people don't
want a job they want to be a passive
income business owner whether that
exists or not um I think no matter what

[1:26:00]
exists or not um I think no matter what
you do you're going to have to find some
good help and you're gonna have to take
a leap of faith to get that help because
you can't sell it until you replace
yourself um and you can't replace
yourself until you've decided what you
want to do
so I
would
from I'm I'm a fan
of from oh that's
it's a little distracting yeah I just
keep calling um it's someone it's
someone that's in front but I it's fine
I can take it to their house later okay
I mean hey this is this is why you're
calling this is exactly what we're
talking about right yeah
um my gut here's my gut like I I'm very
I'm the king of shiny objects I'm the
king of managing seven things at once
whether that's a good idea or not and
I'm so tempted to ask you all about this
other business that you want to buy but
but if you if you still have to find
someone to replace yourself before you
even think of that then I kind of want
to talk about that more

[1:27:01]
to talk about that more
um I just lost what I was what I was
thinking was like couldn't I buy
something like a launder mat or like uh
like I was looking at ATM routs but that
that didn't work out for for technical
reasons having to do with that industry
I spoke to a broker about it but like
having a lerat and paying a guy $20 an
hour $25 an hour just to sit there like
is that is that like what could go wrong
in a laundromat someone loses their
money they need their quarters back
something goes wrong with the equipment
you call the service technician
replacing me here is a lot harder than
replacing you're just putting a body
that Scrolls his phone all day in a
laundromat that like how hard I mean I
always got myself into a lot of trouble
with how hard could that be I know it's
The Grass Is Always Greener right
like you you already know this is the
devil you no right yeah that's what I
tell myself right the devils are in the
details and you know this devil you've
der risked this devil I as you're

[1:28:02]
der risked this devil I as you're
talking I just Googled so there's about
a 100,000 party and event planners in
the United States and in New York City
that's about 3% of the US population so
all else equal and you could argue there
there's a higher proportion of party and
event planners in New York City but
let's just keep let's keep it
conservative there's 3,000 potential not
end consumer customers but 3,000
potential wholesale customers customers
that are touching dozens of other
customers per week or per month right
you have what 20 to 40 event planner
customers no not even I have I
have I have um probably like a dozen
about a dozen that come um a couple
times a month that's what I had yeah
like I turn I don't I don't turn down
business I almost always say yes to
anything that comes in but I I really am
at capacity like if I'm going to double
down here I need to get another person
here I don't think I could I could do
more because I'm here from about um 8:30

[1:29:02]
more because I'm here from about um 8:30
in the morning till about 6:30 7 and
then I go home my kids and my wife
whatever and I come here from 10: till
either 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning and
then the next day I do the same thing
this is what I do basically every single
day until like there's a night where I
just I can't hack it and I go to sleep
like at 11 o'clock instead and then so I
wouldn't be able to to take another
that's that's why I'm that's why I was
thinking like you know I have a little
bit of money maybe I should just buy a
business that makes a little bit of
money where I can start turning down a
little bit of this business
and go you know the next step I'll
figure out the next step later I don't
know what the next step will be but I
just I have to sort of M as long as my
time here that's the problem like yeah
to me that was my problem um and then
just get out of the business at all but
you're saying it's probably better to
double down on this business yes but I
want to ask a couple more questions
before I for sure get to that how many
direct competitor editors would you say
you have in New York City that focus on
weddings and bar mitzvah so in my in see

[1:30:03]
weddings and bar mitzvah so in my in see
I I really appeal to a very specific
clientele that for exactly what I do I
don't think there's really anybody that
does it the the because I have I have
there a lot of people that that broker
this kind of work they'll do the design
and they'll do the the Fulfillment like
they'll they'll assemble everything so
sometimes they'll need like a like a
menu card or a box to give to guest or
whatever and all that stuff needs to be
assembled so they'll do the all the
assembly but they can't do the printing
because the equipment is too expensive
and the people that have the equipment
they don't want to be busy with this
because they're printing 10,000 of this
and 5,000 of that I'm doing the small
orders so most people with the I mean I
I don't know of anybody that has the
equipment and and uh does the the and
works with the event planners anyone
that has equ wound't and anyone that
works the event planners doesn't have
the equipment cuz I for these people
like I print sometimes I'm TW steps
removed sometimes there's I'm printing
for somebody who's putting together the

[1:31:00]
for somebody who's putting together the
whole package for the event planner
who's selling it to the customer so
sometimes I'm two steps behind and I try
I try to find those people also because
you always want to minimize the amount
of customers you work with if you can
maximize if you can increase how much
you get per customer it it's better and
then work with less customers that's
that's what I found at least you know
because you get to learn exactly what
they want and and it you know just a
couple whatsapps back and forth and and
the orders in um so that's what I've
been doing and I've been getting a few
more here and there um but there's not
there's no one that does that does what
that that does what I do I don't I don't
know if anyone that does what I do
especially at the price I do it like
like even if there's somebody let's say
in the city that'll do it or whatever
Manhattan they don't do it at this price
like I I I I make the money on on a
little bit more of a volume and um
whatever I can go into more details but
basically to answer your question
directly is there's no one else that I
know of that does what I do yeah it's
funny you mention prices because on on
the YouTube live stream right now
someone AI home leads just said like
raise your prices right same amount of

[1:32:00]
raise your prices right same amount of
work I did that I did a little bit I
raise my prices and then you get push
back you know they start they start
whining about it but how much push back
right like to 10% like 20% price
increase 10% push back you you win right
that's a net win so I would measure that
before like anecdotally saying you get
because of course you'll get push back
but is it more push back than the
additional Revenue that you're getting
there's only but if there's only so
there's so few people that if I lose the
wrong one you that's that's what my
feeling is like there's like three
people three or three or four people
that are the bigger fish like of the 12
there's three or four that are that like
I'll do whatever they say I'll come in
whatever they want because they they
spend a lot they'll spend like 10 grand
here every month so I um if I lose one
of them that's that's that's a big
problem that's why I'm hesitant like I I
raised prices last year and I was going
to raise it again at the end of this
year but
um I think another thing I could do is
start charging more Rush fees that's
what I wanted to start doing um there

[1:33:00]
what I wanted to start doing um there
are certain customers that I could
charge a rush fee to um that I was
thinking about that um really what I
what I if if I were to double down I I
think I need to to Outsource more stuff
offer more work offer more products and
Outsource more things um that' be the
only thing besides hiring somebody you
know besides that was the you know the
only way to get more money without
spending more money would be to
Outsource more products yeah that'd be
the only thing I can do all right I'm
GNA I'm going to throw up a bunch of
stuff on you it's floating around in my
head okay you ready okay put put your
poncho on um so first of all I
completely understand what you're saying
about being hesitant to raise prices
because you only have a dozen customers
and they're big customers I think you
could use that to your advantage and say
I only have a dozen customers I'm going
to get all of them on the phone and have
a very honest and transparent
conversation about where I'm at in life
right now and about my prices and kind
of feel it out because a lot of people
think about raising prices and it's just
you just send an email and you raise

[1:34:01]
you just send an email and you raise
prices crap I lost four customers crap I
lost a third of my Revenue I'm screwed
it doesn't have to be like that because
of the fact that you have 12 customers
you have the luxury of being able to
talk to all of them in an afternoon and
just feel it out like listen man I'm I
don't know what to do like like we
you've worked the for a long time you
know like I'm just being honest like
what do you think could you could you
afford to take a 5% price hike so that's
my I'm not advocating for you to raise
prices someone mentioned it in the
comments and I thought it was an
interesting idea and you've already
thought about it but I think you should
explore it uh a a little more that
second of all let's say you're I you
know I asked how many people do what you
do none now I know you you're kind of
exaggerating there could be one or two
other guys that you're not super
familiar with I know there's one that
does it but he charges a lot more than
me and when I first preced for raising
prices right there's is what I get is I
get some of the people that want sort of
his aesthetic that he provides like he

[1:35:00]
his aesthetic that he provides like he
does provide an exceptional product like
people in the industry know the party
planners they know so they want his
aesthetic but they don't want to pay his
prices so they come to me they say
listen this is what this guy made for
the last event what can you do that sort
of approximates this so I do get those
like those I'm sort of the B brand a
little bit for this kind of work so I I
I use that to my advantage like I do
have the people
that don't want to pay his prices yeah
okay so let's be super conservative and
say there are 10 people there are nine
other people in Brooklyn New York City
that do what you do if that is the case
um then there's 3,000 party planners and
event planners in New York City let's
divide that market up equally
proportionally and there's 300 for
everyone okay so ba basically if you
were to forx your business go from 12
customers to 48 then that only gets you
to um actually sorry I said that wrong
12 customers to 300 so let let's call it
let's say you have 10 customers if you
were to 30X your business then that puts

[1:36:00]
were to 30X your business then that puts
you at a proportional share of the
market are you with me if there are 10
direct competitors right um so in my
head like you live in one of the biggest
cities on the planet you also live in a
city where they're having a lot of bar
mitzvas and weddings uh I I just Googled
it there's like 60,000 weddings uh a
year in New York 56,000 marriage
licenses issued um I think need to
approach this differently as if like
your print shop like you're you're on
the CP of your print shop 2.0 and not on
the cusp of you know your print shop 1.0
verse buying another business altogether
I would look at the 2.0 version of your
business as another opportunity
altogether and that opportunity looks
like having a competent person to
replace you that looks like growing your
business Maybe by raising prices Maybe
by finding more customers when it comes
to Growing your business I think there
are some uh High leverage low effort
things that you could do I think you

[1:37:00]
things that you could do I think you
should when you have that same
transparent conversation with your 12
customers I think you should offset the
awkwardness of a potential price
increase with the um the promising
aspect of potentially offering a
discount in exchange for like some sort
of a of a a shared marketing initiative
and what I mean by that is you have a
viral marketing aspect built into your
product because your customers are
Distributing your product to hundreds if
not thousands of people and so right
maybe you say hey I'll give you a 10%
price break or or 20% price break if you
distribute my business card with all of
your invitations or if you let me print
like my logo on the bottom right corner
and maybe they freak out like that'll
never work because it's yet but maybe
they don't maybe they have price
sensitive customers that wouldn't mind
that right right it's kind of like if
you're a web designer you're like listen
it's going to be five grand to make your
website or it's going to be three grand

[1:38:01]
website or it's going to be three grand
if you can just let me put my name in
the footer that way I get a back link
and then maybe maybe one day someone
sees it and clicks and I'm able to sell
them a $5,000 website um have you ever
tried something like that yes I did I
did that I did it for probably two years
um on all the day of printing that we do
for weddings I put my phone number and
email address in like Sixpoint font on
the back very small and um one party
planner said no you can't do that um I
said fine no problem it's only one only
one of them said that um everyone else
didn't care I got one phone call and
that phone call was only to they wanted
to know if they could use a part a
portion of my work without paying me
anything for it like they wanted the
files they wanted like my my D
Illustrator files and I said sorry I'm
not gonna do that that's my whole that's
how I make money like my design all
that's my money um so that was the only

[1:39:00]
that's my money um so that was the only
call I got from that in two years about
it had it's at least two years yeah
because I was doing it it could have
been even a little longer than that yeah
just no one no one called no like I ask
every single person that comes in or
calls or emails how they found out about
me I ask every single person it's all
Word of Mouth everything um previous
customers or people that came here to
buy something but you know didn't end up
for whatever reason but you know enjoyed
the experience um it's all referrals all
referrals but no one no one called me
back based on that I tried partnering
with event people and telling them like
with trade show people I tried
partnering with them and said listen you
know make me your preferred printer and
I'll give you a 10 or 20% cut I forget
what I told them I gave them a
substantial cut and they said okay great
and they sent out a promotional thing
and I got a lot of Tire kickers but no
one pulled the trigger uh one% did it
was like like a $40 order it was a joke
um I tried a lot lot of these things um
that that's what sort of makes me a
little pessimistic like like I I've had
people come in here and drop you know

[1:40:01]
people come in here and drop you know
105,000 on an order and I said listen
you know you know whatever you do you
know for business or whatever maybe I
could print for your office and I
couldn't spin that into uh into
customers like I keep I tried a lot a
lot of things what has helped recently
is um calling like the venues instead of
the party planners that's been an
additional stream of Revenue and I just
reached out to a couple other ones that
I found um last week I I did the email
and then I'm going to follow up with a
phone call next week I find that most
people that's like the business advice
uh videos I see recommend that start
with an email and then call and follow
up and refer to that email um trying to
think what else I've tried I've tried a
lot of things no matter what you try you
you do have to have multiple touch
points right and maybe it's the same
venue like maybe you cold call them 10
times and maybe it's 10 different types
of touch points but yeah I would if you
if if you try that again by printing
your name and number I would try
printing a different number that you
only use for that because if you're if
most of your business is based around

[1:41:01]
most of your business is based around
referrals a lot of times leads don't
come back in the door for months or
years right right have have you tried
using a different email address or a
different phone number for certain
initiatives to track I haven't tried
that I haven't tried that I should try
that okay that's that's that's one lever
right but you could hop on upwork and
find someone in Argentina um that has
just a slight his spanic accent um or
it's like Latin accent and have them
start cold calling events and just very
low pressure like Hey we're in the area
and just like eight bucks an hour you
could have them doing that 10 hours a
day and sending you a daily report at
the end of the day how many did you talk
to um how many people showed interest
how many people said never call me again
um like you just you need Hooks In The
Water right like you need a lot more
hooks in the water if you want to grow
and if if you're having operational
issues with this business which it
sounds like you are and I do too no
judgment then that's gonna that's going

[1:42:02]
judgment then that's gonna that's going
to carry you on to the next business
right so it's it's almost like you have
to you're in this is maybe a bad analogy
you're in kind of a toxic marriage right
now you don't know how to get out of it
but you want to yeah it's really what it
is I tell my wife like I have another
woman it's like it's crazy it's like
yeah it's really crazy so you're in this
toxic marriage you're like I need I need
a better wife I need a better woman but
you really need to fix what's going on
there and it might not be your fault but
you still have to confront it head on
and then once you do you're either going
to learn you know what this marriage
wasn't toxic I was just looking at it
wrong or you learn this is toxic and I
figured out how to fix it so I'm GNA go
into another marriage and I'm G to be
that prepared like you're not to that
point yet you're just at like the toxic
point you need to go get to the point
where um you answer that question for
yourself do I need another business or
did I just fix my business in the
process of getting ready to sell my
business and now I don't even want to
sell it right it's you're just like
you're asking the right question but
you're too

[1:43:00]
you're too
early yeah this is what PE basically
everyone's been telling me that you're
you're saying what everyone else has
been saying like why am I running away
from this like why would I get rid of
something that's making me money um
everything that I see as such a big
problem is really very surmount very
surmountable it's not none of the stuff
is insurmountable and I should just uh I
should just figure it out instead of
running from it basically
but you are figuring it out right like
the fact that we're talking means you're
figuring it out yeah I I've streamlined
so many things like um part part of
what's been difficult is it's been me a
lot of my employees majority of the
employees have always been family my
wife my sister-in-law my mother-in-law
worked for me for a little bit in the
beginning and it's hard to get family to
like if you try to Institute a process
you can't discipline people that aren't
conforming to the process because
they're your family so then like if they
don't want to do the process just not
going to but um since my wife left in
November um after our sixth kid and my

[1:44:00]
November um after our sixth kid and my
sister-in-law's has less hours I've been
able to make things very streamlined
everything's been templated there's a
system there's email scripts that I have
that I send to each person depending
their emails depending on what they're
asking like i' I've really streamlined
things a lot um and and it's getting
more and more organized um the
bookkeeping is not great um that's a
that's always been a problem I have to
you I spoked in accounted I know what
I'm supposed to do I just have to do it
but I've just been trying to get get
away from this that's really what I've
been trying to do I've been like holding
out that I could I could somehow just
Escape but you're telling me this is
what I need to do this what I need to do
so okay we're we're about out of time
but I just want to give you a couple
more things okay just I want you to make
me a promise that by the end of the day
you will have two posts on upwork one
for a cold caller one for a bookkeeper
a bookkeeper on upwork will will cost
you 300 bucks a month and well I have I
have a guy I'm working with already

[1:45:00]
have a guy I'm working with already
someone to clean up your books because
you said your books are are ugly and I
get that so yeah I've had I've hired vas
for everything and I've had very hit and
miss experiences but when it comes to
financial stuff like binary like
categorize this or that I've had a lot
of good luck
so I have a guy who told me what to do
like I have a QuickBooks I just I have
to classify you know the transactions
and I set the rules and for some reason
the rules are not automatically
classifying the transaction I'm not sure
why that is I have to figure out what
I'm doing wrong um so in that case open
I would open QuickBooks start Loom hit
Loom and say hey here's what's going on
I'm classifying it it doesn't I don't
know what to do take the that link go to
upwork post in your job posting and say
someone fix this for me please $50 and
it could be fixed by the end of the day
or by the end of the week um I like I've
been in your shoes you're feeling
overwhelmed the only way the only
antidote to that is to take action and
you are we're talking you're doing it
right the so like to not to zoom out too

[1:46:00]
right the so like to not to zoom out too
much but like you're in the game just
stay in the game just keep caring keep
keep grinding keep doing what you're
doing keep worrying about this and the
answer will come like the only thing you
shouldn't do is just throw your hands up
and watch Netflix all day right like
you're just yeah Notting you're getting
there yeah the problem yeah the main
problem I have is that I'm working too
much on the day-to-day and not taking
carry the bigger picture thing so um
I've been trying to work on that the
last two weeks you know an antidote to
that an antidote to that is to is to
like do whatever it takes to this sounds
you're gonna you're gonna hate this
overwhelm yourself even more like try to
get more business because then you will
be forced to find help you will get to
that point where it's like I'm literally
GNA die if I don't find someone right
now right I lean on your lean on your
email list like how often do you send
drip marketing campaigns like how much
are you to something I want to do I I
thought of that last week I said why am
I not sending a newsletter at least once
a month um doesn't have to be yeah I

[1:47:01]
a month um doesn't have to be yeah I
need to send a newsletter yeah so my
wife said she'll set it up you know
because she knows how to use illustrator
I should just um tell her what I want in
it and like you know I think like a
product of the month and uh you know
something about design Trends things
like that I think I can throw something
together but I definitely need to start
with that um I do gift twice a year to
to these you know 12 or so event
planners that I make sure that's that
you know they don't forget about me I
gift them twice a year at the end of the
year and sometime in the middle of the
year I send gifting I think that's
important but the newsletter yeah I
definitely want to do the newsletter um
I try to to send out emails to my whole
list about seasonal things like like
holiday um items things like that and I
do get a little bit of a response but
not not enough once a week you send them
something once a week an email like I do
free gift type of things like anyone
that's been a customer you can swing by
around different times year to pick up
something for free that I print for them
uh like stationary things like that so
I've been doing that um if if I were you

[1:48:00]
I've been doing that um if if I were you
I would literally just write a journal
of what you're doing document what
you're doing the stresses the
insecurities the wins the successes the
the picture of something that you just
printed that you're really proud of and
spend 30 minutes on it a week and email
it out to every single person that you
have even if they're not a customer and
it's your your aunt Nedra like send it
to everyone and I promise that good
things will come back to you you just
have you're not top of mind for nearly
enough
people yeah okay this is what I want to
hear yeah I was hoping to get advice
about the other business okay okay fine
let's let's uh let's save that for
another call Yeah a different call okay
thank you for your help cool yeah thanks
man luck have a great weekend you too
bye bye
bye all right I'm letting Colin in and
Connor is after Colin um sorry you guys
have been having to wait for so
long let's see I'm trying to let Colin

having more connectivity
issues oh I lost Colin he's got bad
internet I've been there Colin I'm gonna
let in Connor and then I will let you in
after that if you get that

B hello sir hey I'm sorry to keep you
waiting for so
long here we are all good yeah okay is

[1:50:00]
long here we are all good yeah okay is
there a delay can you hear me
okay I think there is a slight delay
that usually goes away over time you
just kind of I try to do like a hard
stop at the end of my sentence so it's
clear that I'm done talking but it'll go
away over time sounds good all right let
me go ahead and pull up your
question I uh it's funny because now
that I have these pres submitted
questions it would be really easy for me
to go in and do a lot of preparation but
I'm such a procrastinator that every
Friday it's like 12:59 and I don't
prepare so here we but I did I I read
everyone's question at least once
because people submit questions and I
rank them one to 10 and then my
assistant goes in and schedules um
schedules these calls based on the
ranking and so it looks to me that you
asked how can we attract major corporate
sponsors 100K Plus for our National
Youth entrepreneurship program yes I
remember looking at your website and I
was very impressed with it and so I
would like to hear about your business
and then about your question sounds good

[1:51:01]
and then about your question sounds good
so this is called the children's
entrepreneur Market it is a series of
Saturday morning largely uh activities
think of these like lemonade stands on
steroids uh or like a farmers market
where it's run entirely by the kids so
Mom and Dad can help set up and take
down the booth but the kids run the
whole show and so not only are we giving
kids an opportunity to learn about
marketing and money and uh customer
service and how to pitch and how to
close and and all that uh we're really
empowering them through the profit
motive to get them excited about earning
money but use that as a way to teach
about the principles of free enterprise
and get them to become future little
entrepreneurs and capitalists the
schools aren't doing this parents will
sometimes do a short little Lemonade
Stand but 90% of the time the kids just
sit there waiting for cars to stop so at
our Market events we do a lot of
advertising bring out a lot of foot
traffic so that these kids are not only
selling a lot but more importantly
they're learning a lot through the
interaction so we're scaling it
nationally we're in 26 States we'll be
fully National within the next two years

[1:52:01]
fully National within the next two years
and so to sustain this uh it's it's it's
a nonprofit but to sustain this uh for
the future we really want to develop a
uh a range of corporate sponsorships to
get a lot of we think as a national
brand and as a way to kind of give back
and support these community events it
could be a good strategy I love it first
of all uh thank you for explaining that
so succinctly that's greatly appreciated
I think everyone listening and that will
be listening is able to understand
immediately what you do so you basically
organize organize farmers markets around
the country and soon around the globe
for kids to sell their stuff to teach
them capitalism
entrepreneurship um are you able to
speak about your like your numbers your
Revenue numbers I know you're nonprofit
but I'd like to dig into how you make
money yeah so uh this has been what I
call a philanthropic Kickstart model so
we go out to donors and we get them to
help us launch in Austin Texas or

[1:53:00]
help us launch in Austin Texas or
Orlando Florida or wherever it is and uh
and with that Capital we hire someone
locally in that metro area who is our
market manager to launch all these
events we start setting up events and
then we attract people uh we have booth
fees that are $20 a pop just so the kids
have a little skin in the game um and so
we develop a little bit of Revenue that
way we sell t-shirts for the kids that
say you know I'm an entrepreneur and
have some corporate logos on the back
for our sponsors kind of like a 5k type
of thing so we have those two revenue
streams which are are minor those aren't
going to generate enough uh sufficient
to defay all the costs that go into
operating this program and so the
philanthropy at the beginning is 100%
but the idea is to taper it down to no
more than 20 or 30% of the overall
budget uh both through the booth fees
and the shirt sales but then largely uh
through the corporate sponsorships where
we're going to be able to I think
generate far more Revenue than we're
getting from the booth fees and the
shirts okay so I'm going to pick a
random City and I want I want you to
talk me through what launching in that

[1:54:00]
talk me through what launching in that
City would look like so are you in sou
Falls we're not yet no all right so you
want to go to sou Falls and what does
that look like what what do you do who
do you call how much money do you ask
for and what usually happens so uh we
are focused on launching in the top 200
Metro areas around the country and So
within any given metropolitan area we
launch a bunch of markets each year you
know 10 to 20 or more and so uh we'll
first go to donors in that community and
say hey help us bring this to your city
and and try and find that philanthropic
support once we find some seed Capital
uh we have a network I write a series of
books called the Tuttle twins so these
are books that help their help kids
learn about uh the ideas of freedom and
we have a large national network a
million families so we'll go to
somewhere like CU Falls and we'll uh
create a segment in our email list and
say hey guys you know launching this
project in your city uh would you like
to be a part of it and from that network
of people who already know us love us
trust us we're able to find our market

[1:55:01]
trust us we're able to find our market
manager people who are really excited by
the opportunity to uh work with our
organization so we'll hire the market
manager he or she largely she will begin
developing relationships with the cities
and the community organizations the key
for us for growth is to launch our
markets not just on a random uh in a
park or on a sidewalk but we attach our
event events with large let's say City
festivals and rodeos and other big
events where there's already 5 10 15,000
people coming and so we can kind of
piggyback on those events and generate a
ton of foot traffic um and so our market
manager builds those relationships and
plans all those markets and then
actually on the day of is there to just
administer the whole thing and operate
the whole program all of them ACR across
the country are supported by a very
small national team including our
corporate sponsorship sales guy that we
just hired who's kind of our fundraiser
out to try and attract some of the
support to sustain the the broader
National program so how much money would

[1:56:00]
National program so how much money would
you be looking for in in sou Falls uh so
in each in the metro area itself it's
typically around 100,000 a year for each
metro area that we operate in okay and
that's to support 10 to 15 events that's
correct okay how are you finding donors
to to raise that money from just through
your email list um so you know a lot of
our um locations that we launch in are
aspirational and and not already covered
what I mean by that is we'll have
someone who donates in our national
program without regard to a particular
location we'll use that Capital to go
into strategic places like you know in
Austin there's a lot of you know uh uh
Freedom minded you know capitalists or
LA or Palm Beach and so we'll launch in
some of these places just to give us a
little bit of tow hold so that we can
then go in and start talking to some
potential donors in that area but a lot
of this is with our Tuttle twins books
uh it's a well-known brand people around
the country know it and so that's
allowed us to open up conversations with

[1:57:00]
allowed us to open up conversations with
donors and all these different places uh
and and what I like most about this
project is the hyper locality of it the
fact that I can go to you know someone
in uh Boston and say help us bring this
to your kids or grandkids in your
backyard they will specifically benefit
from it it makes it a little bit easier
to solicit donations as opposed to this
broad generic vague more personal aspect
to it
exactly okay and how much does an
average donor contribute um I'd say the
average donor is probably around a 20
grand a lot of our donors are
entrepreneurs and uh business owners who
can write larger checks and so we get
some that skew very large and a lot of
people will donate 10 2050 but what
we're really after are the people who
can you know uh Drive enough Revenue our
way to allow us to launch this without
us having to spend a lot of time chasing
Small Checks yeah um what is the biggest
check you've ever gotten and how did
that come uh million dollars and uh that

[1:58:00]
that come uh million dollars and uh that
came kind of organically uh someone saw
one of our Tuttle twins ads and reached
out to a friend to say hey do you know
what this is and he said yeah I know
Conor actually and introduced us and so
we built a relationship and over time
they became our our biggest
owner
um how much effort do you put into
asking for more money from your current
donors vers finding new donors a lot
yeah we're we're scaling up our
fundraising team right now and that's a
big part of it is to ask people to grow
with us um but uh you know the the the
same amount of energy we can put into
someone who let's say donated 50 Grand
and to get them to go to 75 or 100 uh
you know some of uh that that energy if
we apply it to finding new donors can
often yield much larger gifts if we
spend our time focused on on you know
the very high net worth business owners
who get really excited about
entrepreneurship and capitalism and they
see that the schools aren't uh doing a

[1:59:00]
see that the schools aren't uh doing a
good job with this at all and they want
to help stem the tide and push back on
that degrading culture so a lot of our
time is really focused on uh meeting and
and cultivating relationships with these
very high net worth individuals who are
aligned with our values have you ever
taken the time to scrape like a public
database of of donors whether political
donors or otherwise uh we've done that
years ago with political donors a lot of
nonprofits uh struggle with that just
because political donors end up being
somewhat of a different animal than uh
than let's say policy uh uh donors
people who are trying to affect
long-term change so where we've
struggled and and other organizations
like us in the past is that political
donors tend to be very fear-based uh and
very reactive you know hey donate $50
today to make sure the other guy loses
as opposed to this like aspiration
Visionary uh type of approach so the
short answer is yes but very mixed and
and often poor results I guess I didn't

[2:00:00]
and often poor results I guess I didn't
mean like specifically scraping a
political a list of political donors but
rather finding um organizations or
databases where the this type of donor
is made public right like I'm thinking
like a children's museum that has a a a
page on their website dedicated to all
of their donors right having a VA go in
and scrape all those maybe it's just and
last name maybe it's just the Jones
family and taking that database and
trying to append the data with uh
address email phone number have you ever
tried that um so we've done that only
for corporate sponsorships we'll go to
let's say an organization like Junior
Achievement or something like that and
uh and they'll list who their major
corporate sponsors are so that that
gives us a signal as to like hey here's
a business that at least in one case
supports you know youth learning
financial literacy and learning about
this and so that's how we developed our
first kind of Base list of what type of
corporations that we're going to you

[2:01:00]
corporations that we're going to you
know try and go after an approach uh
haven't really done it for the
individual donors in our experience a
lot of nonprofits keep that confidential
and there's just not a lot of data out
there um that you can get for example
our own nonprofit We Don't disclose our
donors and so no one would be able to
obtain that data um and so oftentimes
you'll it's it's either corporations or
foundations uh which are are required to
be public in their disclosure about
donating and so those are both ways that
we've been able to try and cultivate
those lists and go after new people okay
let me ask a totally different type of
question do you have any data on how
much revenue flows through an average
market for through the
kids um so the average uh kid earns I
think it's around $150 right now in a
three-hour Market um and so typically we
get uh to 100 kids depending and so
whatever that uh that math is that's you
know n Grand yeah 10

[2:02:00]
know n Grand yeah 10
grand okay and then how many markets per
year on average um so we are in the
process of scaling right now uh just
started last year this year we will do
about 340 markets around the uh the
country um and within 5 years that'll be
up to 2,000 but right now it's 340
market so that's you know uh uh 3.4
million if we're saying about 10 grand
per market and then realistically how
much do you think you'll raise this year
not like what your goal is but what do
you think you'll end up raising uh does
this include corporate sponsorships or
just from the philanthropic donors
directly um including everything
everything all together um
probably I'd say
million and a half if I just had to
think off top of my head okay and so
you're the original reason that you
wrote in was you're trying to find more

[2:03:02]
wrote in was you're trying to find more
100K sponsors right because you're
you're chasing $20,000 checks and you
think 100K it would just be more
efficient right well very specifically
the question is to attract the corporate
sponsors I we have a good strategy with
the individual donors the foundations
we've got a good thing going there
what's new for us is trying to package
this in a way that's very interesting uh
to the corporate givers who are giving
to the junior achievements and others as
well uh trying to find the right way to
to present what we're doing in a way
that would be attractive to corporate uh
corporations specifically what is the
title of someone at a corporation that
might be the decision maker for
something like this a lot of times it's
uh the kind of the marketing uh uh Team
a lot of uh organizations have like a
corporate social
responsibility type of uh person I think
uh I think my team has created that list
of of job titles so I'm shooting from

[2:04:00]
of of job titles so I'm shooting from
the hip but um community outreach is
another one I know we often see some
companies will have a community outreach
team or at least one person on it um so
those are some of the the top of Mind
ones and how what type of Outreach have
you done to these job titles so far uh
for now it's just been we're we're in
early stages for this so just been a lot
of LinkedIn uh Outreach and kind of
creating DM workflows and trying to use
hunter.io to find email address patterns
and then you know reach out to them and
just build a sequence where we're then
following up and trying to cultivate
them and has that been fruitful at all
like I said early stages so uh we've got
some good conversations going but not
specifically any major uh corporate
gifts yet okay and earlier you mentioned
you had a million people is that is that
a million email addresses or what does
that data look like uh those are email
addresses so Nationwide about a million
and uh spread across the country so

[2:05:01]
and uh spread across the country so
these are people who've bought our
Tuttle twins books um or engaged with
our content in exchange for an email
address and so mostly it's the moms uh
getting this stuff on behalf of their
kids so it's basically a million unique
uh households is is how we see it and
how often are you emailing everyone on
that list oh
twice a week okay what are your open and
click rates uh open rates are like 55%
and uh click rates I think are pretty
low because primarily when we're
emailing people twice a week it's it's
more newsletter not not boring corporate
newsletter content but it's it's talking
about current events and uh just keeping
a strong relationship for when we do
have a big sale of our books or
something more specifically like that so
just creating a lot of content and value
in the relationship and and informing
them so not every email is designed to
get people to click I guess is the point
so I think it's like a i a two to four

[2:06:03]
so I think it's like a i a two to four
perent somewhere around there for the
click rate and of of all the emails you
send let's say you send um 100 a year
what what percentage of those are
talking about fundraising or asking for
fundraising or talking about your
markets versus talking about your
books um so I mean 90
5% of the emails are talking about the
books and the ideas in the books um we
only occasionally sprinkle in any
fundraising appeals directly to this uh
this
audience okay so very rarely do you talk
about fundraising now do you ever talk
about markets that you're hosting but
not fundraising to the list so we'll
send targeted emails yeah so we won't
blast the whole list but we'll when
we're ready to launch and see who falls
right we'd have that segment and then
we'd go back out to them say you know
hey guys we're ready to launch here's
how you can sign up your kids here's how
you can support what we're doing um so
so yeah we'll do the the kind of

[2:07:00]
so yeah we'll do the the kind of
segmented uh emails to the particular
people in that region and what software
are you using for email
clavo nice I love it how how granularly
are you
segmenting uh based off of zip
code so we'll do like within 30 40 miles
of the you know core location that we're
focused on and so whoever Falls in that
area and then do you have how much data
do you have on each email
address we haven't done any kind of
external appending and any other data
services like that beyond what they've
given us and so typically it's hey
here's my you know uh shipping address
for the books and so then we get their
their mailing address their phone number
their email um and that's basically it
we we do ask at check out like the ages
of their kids as an optional question
just so we can segment on that but uh
typically it's just their location
information okay um so I love clavio I

[2:08:02]
information okay um so I love clavio I
love email marketing I love that you
love it it seems a million emails is a
ton I don't even want to know what your
clavo bill
is what is your clavo bill I have to I
don't know but I remember I looked year
and it was it was a lot of money oh yeah
I mean I yeah I pay thousands and my
list isn't anywhere near that that big I
I would segment your data even more I
would try to append it um I would also
put your emails in a spreadsheet and
separate out the domains so basically
pull out all of the yahoos and the Gmail
find all the corporate domains and try
to try to find which emails is a work
email and then I would take those far
away from clavio and use something like
lemlist or gmass to send hundreds of
emails not Millions hundreds at a time
from like an email address like maybe
your personal EMA email address um using
a a something like gmass where you can

[2:09:01]
a a something like gmass where you can
plug in their first name you can plug in
as much personalized data as you want
and say Carla like I see that you work
for Coca-Cola uh you know the ttle twins
you're on our email list I I'm just very
curious like this is what we do we we
raise money for this program these
program this program changes lives you
know anyone at Coca-Cola or know anyone
that might know someone that I could
talk to about corporate
sponsorship um I would just I would
start with that and start the referral
ball going from people that are already
seeing your emails in their
inbox what do you what do you think
about that yeah I like that idea um uh
it prompts a question in terms of data
appending do you have any particular
companies or services that you like or
recommend that do that we haven't done
that yet I just did this like a month
ago um oh man let me see if it's it like
pops up in my browser put you on the

[2:10:00]
pops up in my browser put you on the
spot I know
um I just remember the website was green
that's not helping you at all but I can
picture the
website uh I will say that the prices
are all over the map on that and I was
able to find one that was reasonable and
cheap um if I find it I will put it in
the show notes and I will email it to
you as well it's there's probably an
email in my inbox um but I remember it
was like 70 to 80% cheaper this is what
I did I found like four and I test I
uploaded the same list to all of them
and the one that was like 70% cheaper
was just as good if not better than the
others so let me see if I can find it
and I'll send it to you but if if I
don't find it just keep looking until
you find one that's drastically cheaper
and and test test it again yeah in green
and test the same list against a few of
them to see which one works best I like
it um yeah because those services are
really good it'll tell you their uh the
LinkedIn URL of their profile um I just

[2:11:03]
LinkedIn URL of their profile um I just
feel like with a million people you have
such an advantage and you can even take
that list do you do any paid ads
Facebook or Google oh yeah yeah quite a
bit have you have you done lookalike
audiences yep based on that list oh yeah
have you done have you done ads for
corporate sponsors at all not for
corporate sponsorship we haven't no our
ads are all centered around getting
people to buy our books so we haven't
done uh ads for the corporate I would
try that on LinkedIn specifically upload
your email list um to LinkedIn and make
a lookalike audience I don't think it's
called lookalike on LinkedIn but make
the equivalent of a lookalike audience
on LinkedIn for people uh with that job
title
um I would try paid ads for corporate
sponsorships for people you don't even
need to make it look like audience just
upload the million people and make an an
actual audience out of that um and send
the or like push the the paid ads
towards them at the same time that
you're sending these emails so hopefully

[2:12:00]
you're sending these emails so hopefully
some people can see both around the same
time frame it's a great idea fun fun
idea that I'll get working on I like it
I appreciate it absolutely well let me
know if it actually works for you and if
it doesn't let's chat some more ideas
awesome okay appreciate it Chris all
