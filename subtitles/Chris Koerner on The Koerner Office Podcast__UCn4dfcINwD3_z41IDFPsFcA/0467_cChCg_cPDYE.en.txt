[00:00]
how many lottery tickets would you buy
if they were free that's like short form
video it's a 5-minute investment that
could turn into your life being changed
I bought a domain name called Fuego pits
after a month now it's gotten 2 and a
half million views and he has like 300
email addresses that could cause him to
quit his job because I spent 5 minutes
making a reel like that's how powerful
it is we've sold six figures worth of
perfume vending machines somewhere in
the ballpark $200,000 of sales is the
first year that I went full into startup
entrepreneurship for me that's probably
how I'm going to remember this year the
[Music]
most when we look back on this year 30
years from now what are we going to say
about this year what are some adjective
to describe
2024 oh my gosh for me and you or just
generally for like life for me and you
geez chaotic would be one of them I'm
not good I don't know what adjectives
are but the first one you're you're one
for one so far okay okay okay adjective
describes a

[01:00]
describes a
it was definitely a chaotic year but it
was also a year that was super exciting
and not that chaotic means it's not
exciting but I think I always think of
chaotic as negative yeah lots of wins
and lots of failures it's it's weird
it's it's almost like the magnitude of
the wins has been mirrored by some of
the magnitudes of the failures so it's
been a really interesting year
personally for me I quit my job this
year I mean you know this even at the
companies that we owned I always had a
W2 position in those companies and it
was one of the things that made my wife
really comfortable entrepreneurship and
in February March I quit the the job
that I had at the company who had
acquired my home health and hospice so
for me that's that's probably how I'm
going to remember this year the most
it's like it's the first year that I
went full into startup entrepreneurship
the inflection point for
entrepreneurship for you yeah man I mean
most people aren't going to appreciate
this you're going to appreciate this we
were on a text chain cuz we we want to
buy a new house and we were on a text
chain with real turn and Jess goes sorry

[02:02]
chain with real turn and Jess goes sorry
things have been a little busy Nick
started a new business and so we've been
we've been really focused on that and
that's the first time Jess has ever
referred to this as a business ever you
know what I mean like and so for me that
was like that was really cool to see
either she's just finally acknowledging
that she's held hostage or or she's
she's she
the I'm linking twice I'm blinking the
Morris code what was she referring to as
a business specifically specifically
she's referring to content we'll talk
more about that actually in a little bit
but I'm curious to hear you what like
what was what was your adjectives for
this year you're better at words than I
am cus transformative the word
transformative comes to mind oh it's a
great word as far as like startups
business entrepreneurship is concerned
it it was an average year for me just
starting in launching things and chasing
Curiosities but transformative in the
sense that this was the first time I've

[03:01]
sense that this was the first time I've
ever like willfully gone on camera and
published it to the internet other than
like an occasional interview here or
there it's something that I I always
said I would never do really so yeah
like short form video specifically I was
never it just it was very cringe to me
to think about oh that I guess that's
true we'd always talk about doing short
form but as a
joke never as like serious business
content I was watching some of your
short form yesterday you've gotten way
better like even in the last month or
two I want to say when you first started
you were just stiff you're like kind of
figuring it out and now you just know
the flow and the Cadence like you're
really good thank you I just I just
wanted to say that transformative I like
that that's a really good word for this
year for both of us for different
reasons but but yeah for both of us at
the end of last year in the beginning of
this year you and I had very serious
conversations
about like what are we doing we own
multiple businesses
together what's the plan what's the
future we had just started you and I

[04:00]
future we had just started you and I
both like getting into content posting
to Twitter in particular and at that
time you had like 50,000 followers on
Twitter and I had 5,000 followers and we
made like the conscious decision to go
all in on content because we we're
sitting here and we're looking at the
Cody CH sanchezes and the Nick Hubers
Andrew Wilkinson even and it's like
they're doing it in different ways but
they've built an audience and the
audience gives them optionality they can
do whatever they want and as we were
looking at it it's like okay the way
that most people make money Allah Cody
and Nick when he started sell a course
create a community not really what we
want to do you could build a big
audience and sell ads you know maybe we
want to do that for us though it was
about building an audience so that we
could have access to deal flow and
talent and then and then act on those
opportunities and I would say in the
moment I didn't think that we were
actually doing that this year but
looking back as I was kind of preparing
for this episode I'm kind of shocked
with how much we've

[05:00]
with how much we've
done it's been a crazy year I mean you
just C you just crossed a million
followers across all
platforms which is freaking
nuts whatever 20 on Twitter over 400,000
on Instagram 200,000 on Facebook 180 on
Tik Tok it's nuts to me to see how much
you've grown and I've grown just as much
I've grown just as much yeah but it's
been cool it's been it just for me it's
been cool to see
kind of that plan coming to fruition for
both of us yeah I mean short form
content to me is like so powerful I saw
this analogy and it was like how many
lottery tickets would you buy if they
were free how often would you play the
lottery buy as many tickets as I could
fit in my car why wouldn't you well
that's like that's like short form video
it's a f minute investment that could
turn into a whole business your life
being changed 20 newsletter subscribers
a business partner a customer we talk

[06:01]
a business partner a customer we talk
about AI chat GPT
crypto I'm still like I'm on short form
video I just think it's the most
powerful asymmetric bet in the world and
the smarter the algorithms get the more
it becomes so what was the moment that
changed for you cuz you said you used to
hate it it was cringe when I cracked the
code for me I say crack the code it's
like oh what's the secret it's like no
it's like everyone has their own secret
when I found out what my thing is then
the juice became worth the squeeze like
the the cringe became worth it does that
make sense yeah yeah what do you mean
what was your thing are you talking
about once you crack the code on what
the format is or are you talking about
the content right both so what is
content content is sharing ideas right
maybe you share a funny skit that's an
idea maybe you share a clip of you doing
standup you're sharing an idea right
you're conveying an idea in that standup
bit maybe you're sharing a video of you
making your favorite pasta Prim Vera
that's an idea and like I'm an ideas guy

[07:03]
that's an idea and like I'm an ideas guy
that's my thing like I see ideas and
opportunity in everything and so I feel
like for me short form content
specifically is a way to very
efficiently share all these ideas that
are flooding at me on a daily basis
right like it I feel like it was built
for me because I can quickly just get it
out there like I have an idea instead of
thinking on it for hours I can just get
it out there to the world and then the
world says back to me oh I kind of like
this you know and if half of the world
hates it and half of them like it then
it might go viral right and then I just
have to put my feelings aside I just
feel like it's a it's a great place for
people that have a lot of ideas and are
willing to share them and I've always
had a lot of ideas but I hadn't always
been willing to share them so this is a
quick story when we were talking about
doing this the idea behind content is
building trust at scale because if you
build trust at scale and then you have
optionality to make an investment or to
bring somebody on I mean we hired a
chief of staff this year who we had no

[08:00]
chief of staff this year who we had no
business hiring is way more talented
than to come work for two yahoos you
know people trust us and so they want to
work with us and for me when I saw the
the real value of short form was about a
month ago I had somebody on my podcast
we didn't episode and interview and it
was fine the most views I'd ever gotten
on a video was about 4,000 views this
person comes on and they ended up paying
I didn't know this at the time but they
paid to have that that video promoted on
YouTube
and the video ended up getting like
30,000 views so way more than I had ever
gotten on any video and when it got the
30,000 views my average view duration
was almost longer than any other video
My Average view duration is like five
six minutes this video is like 10
minutes long as I was just like looking
at it it was so weird to me like why
would I have so many more views and such
so much longer of an average view
duration because most of the time you
know this the more views you have the
shorter your view compation and it hit

[09:00]
shorter your view compation and it hit
me it's like people are out there who
will resonate with your message but you
have to find them that's any business
customers are out there that will
resonate with your product whether
you're a digital agency a physical
product a consumer goods whatever it is
and you need to figure out how to find
them you are extremely talented at short
form content and the short form like you
said the lottery tickets allow you to
build the audience so that you can then
connect with them on the long form stuff
and build trust it's a means of building
distribution for me that's when it
clicked it's like it's easy for me to
sit here and be like well I'm just not
as good as Chris or you know people
anybody looking and starting out in this
journey of trying to grow a business
well I'm not as good as Xyz competitor
it's like no they've just they figured
out a way to distribute their product
and you need to figure it out and
there's a bunch of tools at your
disposal and you got to figure out what
you're the best at and then Hammer that
home I think that's what you figured out
about a year ago is like I love ideas I
love
businesses short form seems like a great

[10:02]
businesses short form seems like a great
platform and then you just had like a
framework and just boom hit it hit it
hit it hit it and it's been fun for me
to see it's been a bit of a bummer
because we haven't talked very much over
the last six months but it's still been
fun all it just comes down to throwing
spaghetti at the wall and trying a
million different things you know I've
sent you concepts of like funny things
and silly things and and just seeing
what works but man there's a whole world
on the other side of of cringe and just
setting your pride aside or your ego
aside and like not caring what people
think well I think people look at
content as something different than a
real business but there's so many things
that just apply like I just talked about
the distribution you just talked about
iterating like finding your your product
audience fit the same principles apply
because this is effectively a business
at the end of the day so that's the fun
part is like you get to test and see in
real time whether or not you're being
successful dude I didn't even tell you
this story but I've got a buddy from TCU
we go hunting every year and we were

[11:03]
we go hunting every year and we were
hunting in November and he shows me this
video on Tik Tok and it's this outdoor
grill that's only sold in Argentina that
has all these attachments really cool
looking you put coals in it and you can
like hang meat over it and you can like
build it you can custom build it to your
prefer so is it a smoker or is it no
it's like a elevated fire pit for
charcoal that you can put grills over
different shapes and like a Brazilian
steakhouse style you can like rotate
over it super cool and he's like dude
like look at this I was like and he's
talked about making homemade smokers or
homemade grills before he's been a W2
worker forever but he has like this
Amazing Outdoor Kitchen it's like his
passion he knows how to weld he knows
like manufacturing contacts in Mexico
from his job but he's like 50 and he
probably makes 300 Grand a year he has
an amazing retirement package he works
for a publicly traded company it would
be so hard for him to quit and so when
he showed me this Tik Tok video I'm like
dude this is your thing like you could

[12:00]
dude this is your thing like you could
just copy this in America they don't
ship it to America it's only in
Argentina if it would work there it
would work here and this Tik Tok account
had 500,000 followers and it was just
selling these grills in Argentina it's
like you can't tell me that this
wouldn't work here and he's like this
could be the next Trager Trager is a
$600 million company this could be the
next oonie pizza ovens this could be the
next big green egg and I'm like cool yes
but it doesn't have to be like this
could make $5 million a year in net
profit that would be it life-changing
for anyone I took that video and I made
a look at this freaking guy right here
video about it just talking about like
someone needs to copy this and bring it
to America yeah and I sent it to Carlos
before I ever published it and I was
like hey what do you think of this he's
like well it's awesome but like what if
we launch this and I'm like well you
know it's cool for you but I'm not
launching a grill company right now you
know and I was like but here's what I
will do I'll make you know I'll spend 10
minutes making a landing page for you
think up a name I'll buy the main name
and I'll make a video and say like my

[13:02]
and I'll make a video and say like my
friend Carlos he has his job and he's
always wanted to do this and he's now
accepting pre-orders because you can
just do things because this is America
you can do whatever you want and we all
make up the rules so I did I bought a
domain name called Fuego pits and I
published it and it did like okay but
like after a month now it's gotten like
two and a half million views and he has
like 300 email addresses and like 100
people typed out a message saying how
much when can I buy this like it's a
proper business and now he's like
actually talking to welders he's talking
to Mexico and like he's going to put it
in motion he's talking to
Mexico that's like something Trump would
say right we're talking to Mex people
he's talking to Mexico they're gonna
build the
wall this legitimately could become a
business it could cause him to quit his
job because I spent five minutes making
a real like that's how powerful it is we
had this happen six months ago where a
friend of mine tons of great experience

[14:00]
friend of mine tons of great experience
you know who I'm talking about I posted
about him like hey friend of mine tons
of private Equity experience he's been
the COO we grew this company from two2
to $150 million y y y if anyone's
interested let me know I had like a
hundred people reach out and these are
guys who were running private Equity
Funds or people who have a business that
they want to hand it off to an operator
and he didn't end up taking any of those
positions more because it was a personal
thing that was an eye opener for me he
was like this is just some dumb tweet I
fired off that like 300,000 people saw
and over a 100 people that were at like
legitimate reached out to me and were
like hey could I talk to your friend
anyways it's just fre it's crazy to me
it's cool it's been cool to see the
validation of the
thesis over the past year yeah and
people listen and they're like oh that's
not for me that's not for me and it's
it's not like nothing is for everyone
nothing is right if it's not for you
like make sure it's not for you for the
right reason the reason why I didn't
think it was for for me is cuz I didn't

[15:00]
think it was for for me is cuz I didn't
want people to judge me and I cared what
they thought too much and only until I
stopped caring did it make a world of
difference for me it's just that to me
in my opinion that's not a good reason
to not do it we're also lucky I mean
that we were able to have time to do all
of this I mean if we had like actual
full-time W2 jobs there's no way we
could have been able to make as much
content we we as we have made over the
past year we both launched podcasts
we've done over a 100 episodes just this
year
you can't do that with a full-time job
so we've been incredibly fortunate I
would say but we knew that that's why we
were like all right let's let's take the
swing now otherwise like we're never
gonna have another opportunity like this
again all right so if you're listening
to this and you're thinking I don't want
to do content man I don't want to put
okay let's start with audio let's start
with podcast let's start with your
passion everyone's passionate about
something right Nick yes okay so the
acquired podcast you're familiar with it
oh such a good podcast yep
well we don't want to drive people away

[16:00]
well we don't want to drive people away
from this one so it's not that good like
it's fine it's fine don't waste your
time it's pretty stupid honestly I'm
surprised they have an IQ of like 85
combined I don't even know how it's made
combined yeah I'm glad you said combined
because it is honestly I haven't spent
that much time listening to it but I
like what the thesis is of it Ben and
David are the two hosts of acquired and
what makes this podcast different is
they only release one episode a month
the episode is like two to four hours
long and they each claim to spend 100
hours on the topic so they'll do an
episode on Nvidia or on a merger like a
big merger or on Blockbuster versus
Netflix any sort of business topic
usually revolving around an acquisition
or a merger or something hence the name
acquired but they will collectively
spend 200 hours researching for a month
straight and then they'll record it and
it's been around for about 10 years and
it's huge these guys make about $25
million a year in sponsorship and event
Revenue
yeah it's it's that big their Media Kit

[17:01]
yeah it's it's that big their Media Kit
is on their website
yeah their ad slots are like $ 1.1
million $25 million a year that's proven
that's not like me guessing oh my gosh
insane yeah they had an in-person event
with like 20,000 people there and they
were like $75 tickets should we stop
putting out so many
episodes hear me out so I feel like
anyone in the world I think it's
important that there are two people on
this podcast because they're each doing
a ton of research a lot of it overlaps
and so they they each have a deep
knowledge of the subject but it's it's
like a vend diagram it's not all overlap
right so I think you need to find what
your passion is maybe it's Pizza
barbecue food music classic rock doesn't
matter the acquired of X Y or Z right
emo whatever whatever it is Sport
acquired for sports call it game

[18:01]
acquired for sports call it game
changers right where you talk about
dynasties or like a season that will
never see again in any sport or an
athlete or a game right a whole episode
three-hour episode about game seven Jazz
vers Bulls 1999 right tell me that
wouldn't be amazing like you're looking
at newspapers.com you're going deep like
you're you're looking at local
newspapers from the 90s like I just
think what's interesting about this idea
is how much media and television have
changed because in the past if you had
this idea you'd have to go to a
production company you'd have to go to
Netflix you'd have to go to Paramount
youd have to go to Fox or somebody pitch
the idea and then a decision maker would
say yay or nay because you had to get
all of the equipment necessary to make a
quality film now you can get all the
tools and equipment necessary to make a
quality
film for a few hundred dollars maybe a
thousand dollars and so you can do it
yourself you can do all the research
that's super that that is very

[19:00]
that's super that that is very
interesting because we're not talking
about this isn't anything new there's
been documentaries there's been things
like this done before Ben Wilson the
take the world podcast yeah yeah like
his podcast is is essentially a broader
version of this it's it's it's history
focused on people you're talking about
history focused on like a specific genre
like the last dance on Netflix I don't
know if you've watched that Michael
Jordan's last season amazing dude
incredible incredible I think it'd be
fun I think it would just be if if it is
your passion it would genuinely be fun
to do whether anyone's listening or not
it would take years like it would
literally it took acquired years for
them to like hit any sort of critical
mass but now like they're just growing
like crazy and it took 10 like if you
can wait 10 years to make 25 million a
year these guys didn't have like a big
audience before they were just a couple
Tech Bros let me ask you this do you
think that they're successful because
they were consistent or do you think
that consist was an ingredient because

[20:01]
that consist was an ingredient because
you do it for 10 years doesn't mean
you're going to be guaranteed $25
million a year you know what I mean and
you and I both do stuff and it's like if
it's not working if I'm not seeing
results I move on I'm out like how do
you know that something's working enough
to say yeah I'm gonna do this for the
next 10 years because I know I'm David
senra and I know I'm gonna be a
multi-millionaire by doing book reports
essentially right that's what he's doing
he's reading a freaking book and then
he's giving a book report but he
summarizes it in a way that's fantastic
think can people listen to it and anyway
he's excited about it yeah he's super
excited about it it's great it's great
content when it comes to content I think
the consistency is overrated it's
overweighted if you will a lot of people
like oh the algorithms they want to see
you post every day every day every day I
don't believe that to be true I think
the the most important thing in any
content is the idea right and Mr Beast
nailed that right for for whatever
reason a 100 million people want to see
who takes their hand off the lb
Lamborghini last
it's the idea of the video now he has an

[21:01]
it's the idea of the video now he has an
amazing hook he does a lot of re hooks
along the way to keep retention high but
without a good idea you're not going to
get 100 million views so spent the most
amount of time thinking about the idea
like what will the podcast be what is a
broad enough market and also something
that I love maybe it's food maybe it's
restaurant iconic New York City
restaurants whatever it is you have to
love it and yes you need to be
consistent you can't quit but you and I
know know guys that have been podcasting
or writing or doing whatever blogging
for decades and still no one's really
reading that much you know and they
might get a lot of joy out of it and
that's not the point and that's fine no
shade to them but it has to be the right
idea and high quality all right if you
are watching this clip right now you are
watching this on YouTube and if you are
a fan of podcast please check out my
podcast while you're at it because
sometimes I have podcasts that aren't on
YouTube and sometimes I have YouTubes
that aren't on podcast so check out the
Kerner office on any podcast platform or

[22:01]
Kerner office on any podcast platform or
you can go to TKO pod.com also my
newsletter will throw that in there
there are no ads It's weekly it's
different content than my podcast and
YouTube newsletter. chrisj cerner.com
You'll see the link and we'll see you
there I think that's the biggest thing
when when both of us talked about
starting our
podcasts we had to find a reason to do
it other than oh we're going to get a
big audience or we're going to make a
lot of money off of it because we know
ourselves it's like if we don't enjoy
doing it we're not going to continue to
do it both of us genuinely enjoy doing
this for different reasons I love
talking to people and like learning
about them and like getting the story
from them right you love the how does it
work ideation ideation yeah right so we
like it for different reasons and that's
why your podcast is more about the
ideation and my podcast is more about
like getting to know them how did they
do it type of thing but if we would have
been trying to do the same show one of
us would have dropped out because it's
not it's not for us so if you're going
to do this idea pick something that
you're passionate about not to be woo
woo like I'll Follow Your Passion like

[23:01]
woo like I'll Follow Your Passion like
no if you don't like it it's not going
to come through people are going to
listen to it and be like H this guy's
not even passionate about it why should
I be passionate about it I like it it's
a good idea though right it's a great
idea we should do one what would we do
what what would we do some type of
church history I don't know if you're
allowed to do
that I don't know that's a good question
I guess we are doing it with this Friday
episode I might do it on like I tried a
new format this week week where it was
like a deep dive but I didn't interview
anyone I just did the research myself on
the Bounce House industry and I spent 25
minutes just talking all about it and I
got great feedback from it so to me that
was like a much shortened version of
what they're doing I go on perplexity
chat gbt I went and interviewed people
in person I learned the unit economics
of it that upside downside startup cost
all that and then I just report report
back I could do that forever because
it's fun that would be super fun yeah
but even then you're not doing a 100

[24:01]
but even then you're not doing a 100
hours I don't know what what more I
could have learned oh dude you could
have learned so much more I'm sure no no
I know it all bro I got the
8020 all right 8020 let's talk about
some of the wins some of the validating
wins are you ready yep I think biggest
win of the Year side vending want to
recap that yeah I mean I posted a look
at this freaking guy right here video in
July about perfume vending he got
17 18 million views by now the
manufacturer didn't want to work with
this and so we launched a website on our
own and captured a bunch of leads and
became a distributor for the
manufacturer instead and we sold six
figures worth of perfume vending
machines yeah we we've generated it's
somewhere in the ballpark of 200 might
be over or under I can't remember where
it is $200,000 of sales an amazing
validator of the idea I would say for us
we started with perfume vending and then
we did some cotton candy and we've had
some other vending machines what we have

[25:00]
some other vending machines what we have
realized since is that there's a big
learning curve in educating the End
customer so the the entrepreneur who's
going to buy these vending machines so
it's actually a really long sales cycle
because there aren't perfume vending
machines in the United States they can't
call up a local owner and ask them where
did you place your machine what did you
charge charge who's the they can now
they can now yeah that's what I'm saying
is like yeah when we initially did it
the sales cycle has been so long because
they have lots of questions they're the
F you know they're the first guy through
the wall but now they've been units
placed now there are people who are
actually doing it and making money so
this will continue to be a business for
us moving forward that was one piece I
didn't quite expect was just how much
education would be involved in it I just
can't wait to go to a dinner party and
say oh what do you do I'm an
orthodontist what do you do I'm a
neurosurgeon at a children's cardiac ICU
unit oh okay what do you do Chris
and I guys I don't really it doesn't
matter it's silly little thing no Chris
what do you do you know those you know
perfume vending machines you see at gas

[26:00]
perfume vending machines you see at gas
stations and nightclubs no I've never
seen sure you haven't that that's me I I
brought him here I don't know that's all
I want that's why I'm in this game dude
honestly we talked about that before you
tweeted that I was before you posted
that YouTube video I said Chris I just
want to be able to look my lawyer
Brothers in the eye and say I sell
vending machines guys get the Freak
off you enable entrepreneurship that's
what you do yeah yeah we enable
entrepreneurship so side vending side
vending was rad one of the cool things
to come out of side vending was that we
built a sales team so we had I mean
we've had thousands of leads that's one
thing that we'll learn moving forward is
all of a sudden thousands of people
reaching out like where can I buy one of
these things and really quickly we had
to implement a system to track these
leads document them call them follow up
with them Etc and in the process we had
to build out an actual sales team so we
have two sales guys now we have someone
who's managing sales for us
and that infrastructure will allow us to

[27:02]
and that infrastructure will allow us to
Plug and Play different products moving
into the future we we just launched an
agency called repeat leads which has
been years in the making for us we've
talked about doing a lead generation
Agency for years we're using that team
as well to help us on the repeat leads
side of things and then we also have
these like one-off products that we've
talked about right it's like hey maybe
we should tweet about this tractor dude
if we got a if we got a couple hits on
this tractor we could move like 20 units
bro
that part's been cool like to now be
like okay cool we have a sales team this
is how we handle inbound this is how we
pre-qualify people this is how we follow
up with and we're still learning we're
still iterating but that's gonna to me
that's going to be a lasting feature of
of perfume vending it's also been
interesting learning how hard it is to
convert a lead to a sale and for anyone
out there that has 500 followers 5,000
followers and it's like yeah what do I
do with that the amount of loyalty that
you have at that level is unlike
anything else there's 1 % of tradeoff
the more followers you get the more your

[28:01]
the more followers you get the more your
open rate goes down the more your
engagement rate goes down it's just a
fact of life right we know people that
have a couple thousand followers with
agencies that do seven figures a year
because they're selling the right thing
to the Right audience and they don't
have such a big audience to where people
don't feel like they could really
connect with them you know well that and
that was a trade-off we knowingly made
we didn't want to just have an audience
and then sell them a product I was like
that's not we're not trying to just make
money off of the audience
we're trying to grow an audience so that
we then have optionality to launch
different businesses or to partner with
different people but I like Cody Sanchez
I I think she's incredibly smart and
she's doing some really cool things but
that's how she started was like
monetizing her audience and we that or
that's just not the way that we wanted
to go about it in the beginning now we
do now it's like how do we monetize this
audience but just just
kidding okay so we've launched repeat
leads repeat leads is is a lead
generation agency focused on small

[29:01]
generation agency focused on small
businesses typically with a physical
location although that's not a deal
breaker for us and we focus on organic
search in particular SEO and you can
think of that as like technical SEO
where you're actually building out the
website but then there's also
programmatic SEO which is you know
regular SEO on steroids we have
backlinks a backlink offering we have
content offering that's generated and
then we also have Google business
profile that we optimize those are the
main offerings that we have we like
those things because those are the
things that we know and we've used them
on our businesses in the past we didn't
want to like launch an agency that we
didn't know those are all things that
we've optimized and seen really good
benefits from in our own businesses and
so we decided to launch a business
because we're already doing that
in-house with an in-house team so why
not go ahead and offer that to to people
who are looking for it so that was my
brief explanation of repeat leads I hope
that I did a good job because you're
probably going to correct me no repeat
leads is a way for me to productize all
the growth hacks that I've ever done and

[30:01]
the growth hacks that I've ever done and
fell in love with you know today it's a
few different very specific things but
in a year or two it's going to be all
kinds of cool little unique growth hacks
here's a couple other things quick
hitters we invested in a pure
community so everybody's heard of a
mastermind and there are some
masterminds that are like $110,000 a
year we invested in a community called
tribe and they focus on entrepreneurs
who are about $3 million in Topline
Revenue these aren't hundred million
dollar companies these are entrepreneurs
who are growing into their businesses
and you know trying to actively grow
their businesses it's it's $200 to $300
a month right now is their offering we
invested in it because we met the
founder Trenton really liked his vision
we know that there's a need for
entrepreneurs to connect with other
entrepreneurs Chris and I have zero
interest in creating a community and
this just seemed like a natural fit for
us to be a part of and then if people
would ask us hey do you have a community
or hey do you have any coaching or
mentorship easily pass that on over

[31:01]
mentorship easily pass that on over
there because they've got an
infrastructure built out they've got a
cool product they've got a good offering
and we believe in it I mean that's the
bottom line so I'm really bullish on
tribe we've already exceeded kind of
where we thought we would be the
feedback from Members has been
exceptional and I really like Trenton I
think Trenton's doing a really good job
I agree it's GNA be great the next
business we found was a commercial
kitchen appliance repair company based
in Florida and this was a Searcher who
reached out to us and was like hey I
need some Gap funding to close and
frankly I just really like the business
I don't think it's going away I don't
think AI is going to be automating away
guys going and repairing appliances in
these commercial kitchens if anything
that's think it's going to help it and
um it's in a market that's growing very
fast in Tampa Florida it's got an
operator who's been an entrepreneur
before it's got solid financials so like
there's really good Tail wins behind it
and I just fell in love with it because
it's it's SE it's unsexy right it's one
of the sweaty businesses you and I
invested in a lot of quote unquote sexy

[32:00]
invested in a lot of quote unquote sexy
things this is an unsexy business and
it's going really well again we don't
have a a massive position in it but we
have a a good position in it and I'm I'm
excited to see where it goes over the
next year but that would have never come
had we not had an audience and
connections and you know somebody who
reached out to me that saw that we
invest in things so excited to give
updates on that do you want to give
update on fast free care and sunbean PAW
yeah sunbean Paw is our pet cremation
business and we're actually growing a
good bit right now our operator has been
focused a lot more on growth now that
we've worked out the Kinks we're placing
brochures with vet clinics we're taking
on new
customers I'm sorry you need to go read
the comment that someone left on YouTube
did you see it no there's a comment left
on YouTube am I gonna be offended
probably oh
no oh no oh no no no no we provide
logistics for veterinarians that need

[33:02]
logistics for veterinarians that need
their pets to be cremated we don't
cremate them ourselves but we work with
Partners it's a fancy way of saying
we're a middleman uh in The Cremation
business of pets it's funny because
we've talked a number of times on this
podcast about ideas that could take
advantage of the booming pet industry
and we're just on the we're just on the
end of it let me say like it's been it's
been a lot of fun making uh burn and dog
jokes about this business but I'm like
I'm so past that you know we had our dog
and he sadly got hit by a car and it was
terrible it I have a lot of empathy for
people that really love their pets now
you know it was absolutely terrible when
that happened so I'm sorry yeah what are
you gonna do do rest in
peace all right fast recare we love this
business we've had it now for a year and
a half it just continues to be
consistent for us we have is running
that business it's located only in

[34:00]
that business it's located only in
Dallas and
frankly we're trying to figure out what
we're going to do with it because James
is amazing and he's incredible but if
it's really going to grow the way that
maybe he wants it to or that we would
want it to it's going to require more
time and energy from us or we don't
have the desire or the time and energy
to dedicate to it which leaves us trying
to figure out okay what do we do how do
we get James what he needs how do we
grow this business what you know what
are next steps I love the business I
think it's been been a massive proof of
concept for us over the last year and a
half I'd say that's we're kind of like
in this limbo phase it's it's fine it's
consistent it makes money but is that
all we want is it ever going to be there
and really we like James a lot and want
him to have a lot of opportunities so
we've been thinking about what the next
steps are for that business just is it
the best and highest use of our
time I agree I think I think working
with James is but the industry itself
maybe not so if you want to buy a tree
triming business Reach Out Tree triing
Business in Dallas for me that was a

[35:01]
Business in Dallas for me that was a
really validating thing cuz that was one
of my thesises was we could meet really
cool people and work with cool people
and and James is that James is like the
embodiment of that he's he's awesome
he's hardworking he's humble he's hungry
and like I know I want to work with
James I just don't know if that's the
highest and best use of his time at the
moment which similar to the next
business we started an AI Healthcare
company called volara that business
helps skilled nursing facilities find
as many codes as possible when they're
doing the admissions
process it has gone better and worse
than I expected better in the sense that
the technology like really works and
there's traction worse in the sense that
it actually we had never done a tech
startup like this even though that
wasn't the plan our plan was like to
throw a skin on top of chat GPT and then
offer this as a service we brought in a
co-founder his name is Zach and Zach
ended up realizing this needs to be
built out as a tech product so there's
proper engineering he's got a co-founder
now so we have actually ended up

[36:01]
now so we have actually ended up
spinning that out we still own some
equity in it but they're in the process
of raising money and they are beta
testing in more than a dozen facilities
it's going really well I'm stoked for
the for the upside on that but that was
an eye opener for me it's just like stay
in our lane like we don't know Tech I'm
excited for Zach I think he's going to
have a lot of really good opportunities
but building things with software as a
feature is hard it's just really hard
you know what they say software is hard
hard software is soft to say it's
interesting because I've never I've
never had a year with a bunch of wins
that wasn't offset with a bunch of
losses as well like I've never had a
period of life where it's only wins or
only losses I went to breakfast with a
friend the other day that's getting
divorced going through a really tough
time in life right now and he works for
a company that is just crushing it and
his stock options are tripling and he's
making more money than he's ever made
but his marriage is struggling I mean
it's his marriage is over he's divorced
and it it took him by surprise and I

[37:02]
and it it took him by surprise and I
just find that an interesting Paradox of
life where I don't know it's never
really all good or all bad and if it is
seemingly all good then some bad is
usually around the corner and vice versa
so that's true in my opinion the biggest
L we took was with our crypto Services
business we had two Revenue lines one
with sales one with services and the
services were just dragging us down
and so over a year ago we made the tough
call to cut off the services line of our
business because it just wasn't making
any money it was the most onerous and so
we did and we're still doing it and it's
been 14 months and it's just a lot of
hard conversations a lot of angry emails
and Restless sleepless nights and it
just sucks there's no other other way
around it it sucks you know these crypto
bare markets just seemingly never end
it's just not a good industry to build a
really sustainable business

[38:02]
really sustainable business
on no no no and I would say our
experience with that taught us we don't
want to be anything that's operationally
intensive we may be in an industry
that's operationally intensive but we
don't want to be in a position that
requires us to be operationally
intensive from that experience I mean
there's things that we are really good
at and then there are things that we
really like to
do I'm good at operations but I don't
actually like to do it
I I just I don't and you are not a fan
of operations nor are you good at it
right so it's like why would we be in
businesses that are operationally
intensive let's focus on our areas of
strength and and that experience over
the last year and a half has really just
hammered that home for us so every time
that one of us brings up the idea which
is like once a week to go into another
business that's operationally intensive
we're just like hey man we're not doing
that
again Chris dial it back Nick quit
acting like a just because a
business idea would work doesn't mean

[39:01]
business idea would work doesn't mean
you should launch it almost anything
would work almost anything could scale
doesn't mean it's the best and highest
use of your time skills talents it took
me a long time to learn I'm still
learning that I mean we still have
conversations we like but this could be
something oh but we could turn this into
something it's hard to say no unless
it's to drugs I can say no to
drugs well especially when you're just
you're a flood of ideas all the time you
know and you're impatient and you just
want to test them and try it out and see
how it goes and validate the concept but
it's tough yeah I invested in a farm in
Puerto Rico this
year and I lost some money has anyone
ever done that and not lost money no
actually it's a scientific
fact it's the classic like it's the you
know you let your wife start a clothing
boutique you invest in a farm in Puerto
Rico we've all there I had met Hunter
Durham he's on Twitter very charismatic

[40:02]
Durham he's on Twitter very charismatic
very smart been successful and then he
went through bankruptcy for his
businesses and he had a new Venture that
he was starting and it was to start a
business the cacao industry or taking
advantage of the cacao industry in
Puerto Rico so really I I invested in
him I like the idea I wasn't Super Gang
Busters on but I knew that there was a
high probability of it not working out
spoiler alert it did not work out and
he's he's pivoted into I think he's
doing a
digital brand and I I can't remember
exactly what he's doing now but he's
he's pivoted and then the other big fail
for the year we had an RV park in
freaking the middle of nowhere I won't
say it and after we purchased it just a
few months later for whatever reason the
city got a stick up their butt and
decided they were going to shut down the
park so we had to shut down that Park
and sell it had a a little bit of a loss
we were both so excited about it found
it off Market it was a good deal and
then the city came this year and was
like sorry son you can't operate here we

[41:02]
like sorry son you can't operate here we
don't like
Northerners I think when you include the
revenue we made from it and everything
we'll make a little bit of money I think
you're right I don't know why I you
might as well call it a loss because it
time value of money two years having six
figures tied up but we will come out
ahead on paper it was a loss for me
because I put the cash in and it was
like always just my wife and I love my
wife but she's like hey what's the up
dat with the park what's going on with
the park what's happening with the park
and she's right behind
you
what so that that just added a lot of
stress for me personally like that's I
guess that's probably why I think of it
as a loss you're right and like it it
actually wasn't technically a loss on
paper but it it tied up capital for a
year and a half two years no it was a
year and a half and it just added that
weird stressful Dynamic with with my
wife and I so that's probably why I am
thinking thinking of it more as a loss
yeah all right so transformative is the

[42:01]
yeah all right so transformative is the
freaking best word for this past year
because you and I have been working
towards something over the last I mean
we known each other 20 years but over
the last five years in particular as
we've partnered with different
businesses and it felt like this year we
finally figured out okay this is the
thing and we're doing a lot of things to
clean up to get organized Etc but it
it's just transformative because it
finally went from thesis and chaotic
mess to
okay this is the direction that we're
going in and this is this is how we're
going to get to where we're going and
yes we had some losses but dude it was
just such a cool year there like there's
so many amazing things that happened
this year that we probably didn't even
touch on so I love 2024 that's how I
always going to remember 2024 as a
transformative year for both of us
agreed all around all right what are you
most looking forward to in 2025 I'm
excited to put out a lot more content a
lot more a lot more oh you are thir
boy
okay I want to put out a thousand

[43:02]
okay I want to put out a thousand
business idea shorts next year three a
day and I want to film more like out and
about dirty job style long form YouTube
videos that's what I'm really excited
about
yes content so it's content that's your
that's your excitement okay yeah I would
say I'm in the same boat I am I'm really
excited because I feel like I am where
you were a year ago I don't think I'm
ever going to get an audience as big is
your audience but to me it's like all
right this is what I am and I I just
have an opportunity now to hammer at
home I want to put out 20 out andab
Style videos where we I'd prefer to do
most of them with you because I just
think we'd have so much fun the dynamic
of us playing off of each other but
going to different businesses and just
asking them like how do they work how
like what do you do how do you provide
service I I've learned so much over the
last year just in our podcasts prepping
for our pod podcast and then
interviewing people on my own podcast
there's a whole world of business that I

[44:00]
there's a whole world of business that I
didn't even know existed I think it
would be really fun to go out and about
and and interview people I'm also
excited to take what we've been doing
and scale it so I'm I'm GNA focus a
little bit more next year on Healthcare
I'm I'm starting a healthcare podcast
that's focused on the healthcare
entrepreneur because I think that's a
market that's just underserved it's
dying for knowledge on how to do this
stuff and again I don't know what the
monetization play is yet but my
brother-in-laws are do podcast with me
and we're going to do the Fulfillment on
the back end is the co-founders podcast
Network so curious to see if that turns
into anything but those are the things
I'm probably the most excited about next
year we're not content we're
content emphasis on the
con it's not who you know it's
TKO oh oh if you know
utko I'm sorry did you copyright that
yet just did I just I just bought the
always has
been your favorite

[45:03]
meme all right 2025 here we come baby
happy New Year Merry Christmas
