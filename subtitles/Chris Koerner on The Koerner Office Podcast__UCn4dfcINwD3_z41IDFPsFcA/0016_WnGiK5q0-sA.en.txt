you could use outs scraper you could use
LinkedIn you could use Apollo but it
sounds hairy sounds messy I would get
that database and then I would just
start brt building a relationship of
trust with the owners putting his name
out there sending him a gift basket
sending him a letter shooting them a
text shooting them an email giving them
a call hey this is who I am this is my
story I've had a nine-o-five job I hate
it I want to be a business owner like
you I love your business no one's
passionate aboutut custom souvenirs to
gift shops But Me You Are I Am you've
never met someone not in the industry
that was as passionate about this
industry as I am right they will take to
him like like flies to Honey right they
will be so flattered that someone cares
about their little industry that they
will want to sell to him eventually and
it's the law of large numbers if there's
806 businesses out there that he could
potentially buy and none of them want to
sell right now
