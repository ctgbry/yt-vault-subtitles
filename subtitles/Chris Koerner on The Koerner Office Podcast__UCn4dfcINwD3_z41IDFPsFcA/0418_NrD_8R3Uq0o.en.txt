look at this freaking thing right here
this is one of the most genius things
I've ever seen so if you own a
greenhouse you need to keep it warm
during the winter and that cost money
but what you see right here is a Bitcoin
miner what that does it mines Bitcoin
247 and depending on the price of
Bitcoin and the difficulty rate and all
that it can profit between 1 and $15 a
day that's after your electricity cost
and it keeps things really warm it acts
as a space heater 24/7 so people are
starting to put those two things
together a greenhouse and Bitcoin miners
so instead of paying money to grow
plants in the winter they're getting
paid to grow plants in the winter full
