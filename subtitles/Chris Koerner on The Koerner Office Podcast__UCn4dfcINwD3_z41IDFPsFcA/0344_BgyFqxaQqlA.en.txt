[00:00]
welcome back to the ker office it is
Friday therefore it's time for holdco
Bros with Nick and I we talked about
three things today quick and dirty for
you we gave an update on our perfume
vending machine business which is now
called side vending because we're
selling other types of vending machines
it's kind of a crazy story we talk about
a company called the pros closet that
just got shut down crazy story there
300,000 email addresses going to waste
we talked about how you can monetize
other companies email addresses and then
we talked about negotiations as a
service or what I like to call I only
eat when you eat you're going to love it
quick it's easy
[Music]
enjoy all right so time for a little
perfume vending update so over the
summer launch of real it goes viral
about a perfume vending machine we start
selling perfume vending machines we sold
a little over $100,000 worth and then
our two Rockstar sales guys left in the
same month one of them took another job
one of them started a company and that's
kind of the sucky part of having a
company called co-founders is that all
these guys want to go start other
businesses what are you going to do
there a trade-off yep so we went from

[01:02]
there a trade-off yep so we went from
sales every week to zero sales because
zero sales people but we just hired
three salespeople all of them rock stars
very excited and we have three products
now we're no longer PV perfume vending
Nick what what are we selling what are
we selling Nick dude what are we selling
all right so we got perfume vending
machines people know about that they're
not really super popular here in the
States but they're popular in Europe you
go up to it you pay money you get a
spray of a perfume then Chris had this
post it's a machine that that cleans
motorcycle helmets randomly went viral
and then we are also now selling drum
roll please cotton candy vending
machines of course we are most people
are like oh I had an accident this
weekend oh what happened oh I tripped in
the yard while I was doing yard work no
Chris is like oh I had an accident this
weekend oh what happened oh I tweeted
and started as a new sixf figure
business I'm
sorry or posted a video because that's
more accurate lately but yeah cotton
candy vending machines are just so
obvious because it's so visual

[02:00]
obvious because it's so visual
it's you're selling to kids the margin
is like somehow the margin's over 100% I
don't know how that math works but it's
there and so like people want to post
about it the kids want to buy it the
thing's on Wheels so I posted a video
about it and it went semi viral and we
got a bunch of leads and we got over
2,000 leads on the helmet cleaning
vending machine and now it's like we've
accidentally started a company that
makes videos that drives leads to sell
random vending machines well and what's
crazy about it to your Point like when
we first posted about this in August and
we got a bunch of traction we had sales
guys we didn't think we were starting a
real business it was like oh cool we'll
just capture this opportunity and now
we've actually created a proper business
we've talked about this all the time it
always takes longer than you think and
costs more than you budget it for you
know what I mean like here we are now
almost November and yeah we've sold
almost $200,000 worth of vending
machines but it still feels like we
haven't even scratched the surface of
the opportunity just because we've been
creating the foundation in order to grow

[03:00]
creating the foundation in order to grow
it yeah it takes longer than you think
it costs more than you think and your
projections almost never are hit yeah I
think I think there's like always two in
my opinion two ends in this P either you
blow past your projections you just
freaking crush it like we did with
mining Syndicate right like out of the
gate $10 million in the first three
months revenue and you're like holy crap
I didn't even think that was possible or
you significantly like undershoot your
projections you just you took longer
it's not that anything went bad you just
don't know what you don't know time
that's why so many entrepreneurs are
like if I knew everything I knew now I
wouldn't do this business again it's
just because you don't know I had this
conversation I think ignorance can be a
really good motivating force to get you
to do something because if you actually
knew everything you would never start
yeah my wife says Chris you're ignorant
I said but Nick said that's a superpower
so did she say ignorant or ignorant I
have to make a call okay I heard it I
heard it anyway so that's a quick update
it's a fun business yeah shout out to
the three sales guys we got Gage we got
Terell and we got Jeff Jeff his name GI

[04:01]
Terell and we got Jeff Jeff his name GI
off which is freaking amazing and we are
stoked to have them and building a
really cool team that's right all right
all right all right little story here
little story so what happened during Co
I'm GNA tell you what happened because a
lot of things happened everyone bought
bikes okay are we in agreement everyone
bought bikes
okay I don't know I didn't buy a
bike I I bought bikes because you bought
Pon so I don't I bought all the bikes I
bought bikes okay I went over to Chris
I've been to Chris's house many times
he's got a pelaton in his room but he's
also got this like little contraption
that allows you to take your real road
bike bring it into your room and like it
acts like a pelaton I don't even know
how to describe it but I'm like well
what's the point of the pelaton you're
like if I want to take one of the
classes hello dude when Rachel's
teaching go go go guys okay 17 18 feel
the pum feel the pump coming down coming
down it's so obvious what's different

[05:00]
down it's so obvious what's different
about these Nick on the pelaton you're
taking virtual classes with virtual
people and it's like so fake it's just
fake and synthetic but on the on the
Wahoo which is the name of the
contraption that you put your bike on
where you connect with zift for $15 a
month you can ride in a virtual world
against people all over the
world okay it's much more real it's much
more real it's totally different all
right so everybody during Co bought a
bike is where we landed so this is what
I bought I bought a pelaton bike I
bought a pelaton treadmill I bought a
bike to put on my Wahoo a Contraption so
I could ride in the virtual world via Z
zift then I bought a road bike for the
road to get outside course course and
then then I bought a mountain bike right
okay so that's fine for the mountains in
Texas thankfully all of this happened
while mining Syndicate was going from0
to 10 million when I had money for all
this stuff cuz I have not bought a bike
since if for people who don't know Chris

[06:00]
since if for people who don't know Chris
is the cheapest person in the world for
so for him to buy five essentially of
the same thing it just tells you how
much discretionary income he had at the
time yes anyway I bought my two real
bikes from a business called the pros
closet the pros closet has been around
for 12 13 years it they're based out of
Denver
and it's pretty much like a CarMax for
bikes but online only you can sell your
bike to them and ship it to them or you
can buy used bik bik from them also
accessories new bikes Etc but really it
is an8 fig used bike business called the
pros closet okay jez they were doing
well before Co then Co hit they were
doing really well and they went the VC
route and they raised I want to say $55
million now let's let's be very clear
Nick this is a Shopify store it's a
Shopify store right period And so what
was interesting was if you if I'm in
Texas there in Denver I want to sell my

[07:00]
Texas there in Denver I want to sell my
bike to them they would ship me like a
bike box and I could break down my bike
and ship it back to them but here's what
they did wrong they paid way too much
for their trade-ins because the value of
bikes went crazy in 2021 2022 they paid
too much and then everyone stopped
buying bikes but they paid way too much
for these bikes they couldn't unload
them they've got a glut and I went to
the website the other day to look for
something I hadn't been there in a year
and it literally said we have one more
bike left in stock we're going out of
business this it's been a great ride
great 13 years what and then this is on
their website they said we have sold
over 50,000 bikes and then they didn't
say how many accessories but 50,000
bikes and the average bike on the pros
closet is like three grand so what's
that 150 million 150 million in 12 years
plus accessories shirts helmets you name
it they went out of business wow how are
they going out of business especially
when you raise $55 million well I guess
when you just buy all that inventory
maybe that's why they're going out of

[08:00]
maybe that's why they're going out of
business right because like no exit
scenario was good enough to pay off
their
shareholders so diluted isn't that crazy
like it's really easy in hindsight to be
like dude what what are you doing like
why why are you doing that but nobody
knew we didn't know what was going to
happen right like I remember having
conversations about e-commerce like
who's going to go back to the grocery
store when we're all accustomed to
ordering them online everyone went back
to the grocery store you know like yeah
instacart's still there it's it's doing
fine but like if you look at the
e-commerce Trends e-commerce jumped
forward like seven years during Co and
then it shrunk back like five so it's
still a net win for e-commerce but right
A lot of it just went back to doing what
we were doing before well it's I mean
it's just a testament to how much money
we had in the system everybody thought
that their thesis was correct they're
like oh no no it'll make sense and even
if we don't even if we're not right we
have all this money to put somewhere and
they put it into weird butts like this
that is such a freaking weird man that's
a crazy story and really it's the same
conversation as mining Syndicate because
we launched that during that time time
of everyone having way too much money

[09:02]
of everyone having way too much money
and China had just backed out of Mining
and the the like the mining
profitability had never been higher
literally ever so it was like the
perfect storm to launch that but really
when we tell people we were successful
because we're so good at business I mean
thankfully we didn't expand the way that
we could have expanded and we had a lot
of opportunities to really like dude
let's double down on this let's build a
facility let's buy this company let's
let's do all these things and we
timately decided not let's be more
conservative with it and that's that's
honestly saved our skin I think if we
would have overstretched it would be a
much different
situation I agree but I'm not done
talking about the pros closet this isn't
just me talking about something cool
that I saw there's opportunity here Nick
there's so much opportunity do you
remember in the newsletter business you
you know a good bit about the newsletter
business roughly the revenue per
subscriber you can expect per month if
you send a daily newsletter call it five
times a week do you remember $2 it

[10:01]
times a week do you remember $2 it
depends like it depends on a lot of
things are you in finance are you
in probably probably like A50 cents
exactly 50 cents per subscriber per
month and so how big is the pros closet
email list after 12 years serving so if
let's say they had they sold 50,000
bikes and 50,000 accessories 100,000
customers what that doesn't account for
are the multiple hundreds of thousands
of people that subscribed and never
bought anything like on my e-commerce
sites it's like a 3 four 5 to1 ratio of
emails to actually paying customers so
they could have an email list of 3
400,000 people which would be a $200,000
a month newsletter and you think you can
monetize a cycling newsletter like
cyclists are affluent they spend money
they're passionate they're like it's the
perfect demographic to sell to so now
You' got a 2.53 million doll a year
business with 75% margins it's not a $30
$30 million a year business but much
more profitable and easier to run they

[11:02]
more profitable and easier to run they
have to be doing that right I mean if
they took VC money those guys are smart
they're probably stripping it for parts
at this point or at least trying to
figure out where the asset value is I
reached out to the CEO oh you don't care
do you you don't care am I in it for the
game or the content Nick oh I'm sorry
but Chris kerer is in for office hours
and he's ready to teach go ahead
Professor I just reached out to the CEO
via LinkedIn and I was like dude what
are you doing with your email list I
want to buy it and he's like we already
sold
it so there it is all this
hype if I can't live up to the hype I
gotta make it a little funny I gotta
make n make a little funny it's good but
still like I I I wish I knew what they
did and maybe one day I will know my my
whole point is
that name there's three million Shopify
stores okay let's say 30 th000 of those
are big businesses big being eight

[12:02]
are big businesses big being eight
figures plus and people would be
surprised any one of those businesses
could have a paid newsletter alongside
what they're selling on their Shopify
store why not I've told you this before
but I have like
three goals in business three like three
other goals in business one I want to
become a professor adjunct would be
perfectly fine by me I'd love to teach
at a university I think that'd be super
fun two I want to buy a business out of
bankruptcy like I want I want one of
those stories that's like so yeah I
bought it for 500,000 and now it's a $20
million a year company I I just think
that's really cool and this is one of
those types of stories I think that
there are a lot of other opportunities
out there but how do you find them like
that's my thing is I'd love to find one
of these that are like going out of
business or just shutting their doors
but what's the game there how do you
find them we talked about this like two
months ago you sell the one to sell the
many you go through the CPA or you just
freaking tweet about it and like people

[13:01]
freaking tweet about it and like people
that have failing businesses are not
going to be talking about it but they
will in the DMS if they think you can
help them dude you know the third goal I
have I want to own uh commercial real
estate I know that's like stupid but I
just you have a fourth though
too what is it did I forget it what is
it yeah I thought you wanted to own like
a restaurant or something oh no like no
like seriously like something where like
an ice cream shop you
yeah I mean so my brother-in-law Owen is
a big foodie and we've talked about like
when we retire and we're just done and
we want something to do it'd be cool to
to have a restaurant together that's
just like small town maybe we sell ice
cream maybe we just sell like caramel
apples or like it's it's kind of
specialized it's not necessarily A a big
old restaurant but I just think that
would be fun to keep you busy like I'm
not thinking of that as like oh that's
make money that's going to be a bucker
list item that's good one that's what I
want to do with barbecue
all right if you are watching this clip

[14:01]

that aren't on YouTube and sometimes I
have YouTubes that aren't on podcast so
check out the ker office on any podcast
platform or you can go to TKO pod.com
also my newsletter will throw that in
there there are no ads It's weekly it's
different content than my podcast and
YouTube newsletter. chrisj cerner.com
You'll see the link and we'll see you
there all right we ready for me yep I
need a little rope here okay I'm gonna
try my best not to talk that much but
this requires some explanation so I need
you to keep me on track are you ready
yes sir all right have you ever heard of
a pharmacy benefit
manager I just fell asleep while you
said those three
were so that's no let me back up do you
know Mark Cuban never heard of her
absolutely Mark cubin has a company
called Cost Plus drugs you've heard of
that company right absolutely and also
also I will say we were talking about
this type of stuff the other day and you
were sounding really intelligent and
then I flew to Columbia and I listened

[15:01]
then I flew to Columbia and I listened
to the latest all-in podcast with Mark
hbin and then I realized oh Nick sounds
smart just cuz he listens to the Allin
because it was like mamad Muhammad cut
this part it was like it was really good
and it was Mark cubin so I learn a lot
about that type of stuff okay so Mark
cin has this company called Cost Plus
drugs and this is going to be a play on
that but it's a phy benefit manager and
what a pharmacy benefit manager does is
you or I as an individual can't go to a
pharmaceutical manufacturer and just buy
our drugs directly because we couldn't
afford the price so the pharmacy benefit
manager kind of acts as a middleman they
negotiate bulk pricing and then they
sell to the end user typically the
pharmacy benefit manager is working with
a company so the company utilizes a
pharmacy benefit manager to purchase
drugs on their behalf I want you to
guess how big the pharmacy benefit
manager industry is I'm just going to
sound like an idiot I don't know I don't
know 30 billion 500 90 billion Muhammad

[16:01]
know 30 billion 500 90 billion Muhammad
literally edit this out please I do have
some pride left I have some pride
left dude it's massive it's massive so
this it's a massive industry it's a
massive expense to businesses so on a
yearly basis companies spend on average
$1,000 per year per employee on Pharmacy
benefits and the way that it works is
there are thousands of drugs right so
like how do you know what price you've
negotiated on what drugs is they they
have this thing called the formulary
again I know I'm getting in the weeds
here but this is important they have
this thing for called the formulary that
spells out exactly how much each drug
costs and then you purchase at that
price so but there's a problem here
there's no transparency in the industry
typically pbms and manufacturers have
non-disclosure agreements so they other
pbms don't know what other pbms are
necessarily purchasing those drugs at
right so when they go to negotiate with
the manufacturer there's there's some
asymmetric information that manufacturer
has it the PBM doesn't the flip side

[17:02]
has it the PBM doesn't the flip side
companies pharmacies they also don't
know what other companies Andes that are
purchasing from the pbms are paying for
specific drugs so the PBM has a lot of
pricing power so it's very opaque you
don't you don't know necessarily what
what people are paying because of either
non-disclosures or these companies just
want to keep the margins for themselves
okay so we went over there's two ways
you can buy DRS it's either through the
PBM or through the manufacturer some
some companies when they get big enough
become self insured have you ever heard
that word before M and what that means
is like they're eliminating the PBM
essentially in in this case they no
longer need the PBM to go negotiate on
their behalf because they have enough
purchasing power to go and negotiate
directly with the manufacturer but again
they have to negotiate the formulary
they have to set the prices first and
still the manufacturer has some
asymmetric information so enter Cost
Plus drugs Mark Cuban's company
publishes their formulary online his

[18:02]
publishes their formulary online his
whole thesis is look we're just going to
mark up 15% so we don't really care this
is what we're paying for these drugs and
then we we Mark everything up 15% it's
now out in the open what a big company
like Mark's company pays for these drugs
the
average markup is about 30% so if you if
you're spending $1,000 per year per
employee the the pharmacy cost if you
will is like $770 and the employer
markup is $230 so you're paying $230
essentially of profit to the PBM who's
in between you with Cost Plus if it's
still
$770 for the pharmacy you're now paying
$115 difference you're saving $116 a
year per employee so if you switch to to
Cost Plus that's how much money you'll
save let's call it $100 per employee per
year think about companies with a
thousand plus employees right a $100 per
employee per year all of a sudden
becomes $100,000 a year in savings all
right this is where I think the business

[19:00]
right this is where I think the business
opportunity is I think you could start a
business where you just reach out two
companies and you say hey look you
negotiate your formulary every year
right yep all right and and the company
could negotiate with the PBM or they can
negotiate with the manufacturer doesn't
matter whether it's the middleman or the
actual manufacturer and you say hey look
I will help you reduce your overall
spend on Pharmacy I just want you to pay
me a percentage of what I save you and
and they'll say like oh okay how are you
going to do that you don't necessarily
to have to give away your secret sauce
but you can now go and see publicly what
prices Cost Plus drugs are charging and
you can use Cost Plus as a stocking
horse you can say hey look PBM either
you renegotiate with us or we're going
to go to Cost Plus or you go straight to
the manufacturer and you say hey look I
know this is what Cost Plus is paying
for you know buying for these drugs I
want it even cheaper use that data to
essentially level the playing field
there's no longer this asymmetric
information that that they either the

[20:02]
information that that they either the
PBM or the manufacturer are negotiating
with because now you've you've leveled
the playing field and I think that there
is a ton of money to be made just by
reaching out to these companies and
either saying I can look at your
formulary and show you which drugs you
need to negotiate harder on or I'll do
this for you as a service what do you
think I love it first of all let me get
my jokes out of the way before I respond
to it hey Siri remind me to email the
president of Marvel to make a new movie
series where he assembles a cast of
characters called the formulary okay I
was muted
right what's
Up's love it second of all I think it's
a it's a good bit if if you're talking
to someone like at a dinner party and
they say something confusing like you've
heard of that right you're like oh PBM
yeah all you got to do is make it an
acronym and they'll assume you know what
you're talking about okay I'm like well
okay I've never an acronym and and I'll
assume you know what you're talking
about okay yeah no I love it like this
goes in line with with the our thesis of
like what you can't just like look at

[21:01]
like what you can't just like look at
this guy's website because he's probably
like why can't they just look at this
guy's website because they don't know
about his website they're that's not
their sop like they're they're not
thinking to you still have to negotiate
right like that's the hard part is
negotiating not just looking at the
website and for many of these companies
it's such a small line item that many
times like they don't even think about
it right like if you're if you're
company doing let's just say $10 billion
a year in sales and your Pharmacy spend
is a mill million dollar a year that's
nothing on the p&l to you but for you or
I if we're starting a business and we're
like hey I'll take that million down to
500,000 and I just want 20% of The
Upside and I'll do all the work for you
it's like oh yeah sure no no brainer
I'll I'll Outsource this to you so I
definitely think there's a ton of
opportunity to go to larger companies
and help them renegotiate their Pharmacy
formulary so if you're like writing
notes Pharmacy formulary large companies
pbms to me that like there's a massive
opportunity there wouldn't that make it
hard to sell into these guys if it
doesn't move the needle that much like

[22:01]
doesn't move the needle that much like
eh yeah we could save money I can say
how it works there's no risk but like
that's not a priority yeah I totally
could but usually each one of these
departments are mandated with a budget
of some sort and and the budget that
they're focusing on for the most part is
going to be on premiums or their their
risk pool for overall health costs and
Pharmacy is typically a minority of
their spend the majority of their spend
is going to be on pre-existing
conditions surgeries or primary care
physician like many other health
services other than just the pharmacy
benefit so I think it's not the top
priority and so they would be
incentivized to work with you because
it's saving them money and saving them
time but it's not going to be something
that they're necessarily looking at
full-time from their position because
for them it doesn't move needle as much
as other things how could someone listen
and get their first customer doing this
what I would do is I would just honestly
go to someone that you know who owns a
business small business could be a small
business and just ask them hey tell me

[23:01]
business and just ask them hey tell me
about your benefits how does it work I
guarantee for the most part they'll be
like I'm not really sure so I would
start digging in if because if you know
nothing about the space it's going to be
useless for you to go to a bigger
company so just go to a local company
that you know start digging in like okay
how does this work how exactly do they
negotiate the formulary okay they're
insured by UHC who's setting these
prices and then once you get a little
bit familiarized with it I would
honestly go to LinkedIn and just look at
people in your local area or your
network that are working for large
companies that are in a either Human
Resources position or an executive
position on the finance side CFO
controller Etc message them and be like
hey when you renegotiate this year for
your benefits please let me know I have
a program that can save you
30% on your Pharmacy benefits for the
first customer you said to get a
business owner what like what type of
business would he own for example well
they have to have have some employees
that they help pay for benefits for so

[24:02]
that they help pay for benefits for so
it's probably going to be somebody that
has at least I think the number is 20
employees I can't remember what the
Affordable Care Act mandate but if you
have something 26 or something it's yeah
it's somewhere in that ballpark where if
you if you have over a certain number of
employees you have to offer health
benefits otherwise your employees can
just go get benefits on the exchange so
it has to be somebody who has a business
that's like let's just call it 30
employees or larger and then after that
it doesn't matter really what the
business business they just have to have
a certain number of employees that cross
the threshold that require them to
provide health insurance so you could
just like use Manta or some other
generic business database and sort out
all the ones smaller than call it I
think it's like 1 to 50 50 to 100 just
sort out everything under 50 start
reaching out to them if you were just
going to do it cold I would do it
locally because you want to be able to
go meet with them in person I mean yeah
health benefits in particular are just a
very intimate I guess thing to
renegotiate so I would look for local
business owners that fit that profile I
think I tweeted about this I call it
like the I eat when you eat it's kind of

[25:02]
like the I eat when you eat it's kind of
like the idea of the FedEx savings I
don't remember where I talked about this
but this company that I use called 71
pounds they would audit your your FedEx
labels and if anything was late they
would automatically file a dispute and
whatever they recovered they would take
30 or 40% of and it was really timec
consuming and manual for a business
owner to do this for himself but they
had automations hooked up where they
could do it with zapier right just a
beautiful business model all right so
before we wrap up this episode we want
to do something new we want to call it
marry date or kill on these three ideas
so to recap the three ideas perfume
vending machines and what we're saying
here is the general idea of using social
media to generate attention for a high
value Asset and then reselling it an
asset that someone else manufactures
that's the idea in general the second
idea is that of repurposing someone
else's newsletter maybe it's an
e-commerce newsletter maybe it's a
Manufacturing Company anything to make
like an ad driven newsletter out of it

[26:00]
like an ad driven newsletter out of it
to monetize to the tune of hopefully 50
cents per subscriber per month it could
be your newsletter it could be someone
else's piggyback and the third idea is
Pharmacy negotiations as a service Andor
cost savings as a service benefits
negotiations as a service and you
monetize by taking a percentage of money
saved correct correct all right mared
dat or kill I know it was my idea and
I'm being selfish I would marry the
Pharmacy negotiations or just
negotiations on a service I would why
I'll tell you hold on just let me just
let me sir yes sir I would marry
Pharmacy negotiations as a service I
would date Pros closet and I would kill
perfume vending all right so I would
marry Pro closet I would date Pharmacy
negotiations and I would kill perfume
vending we both would kill per okay why
would you kill perfume vending because
it's reliant on going viral and that's
100% that was the same reason I had yep

[27:02]
100% that was the same reason I had yep
yeah it doesn't work unless you have
some way or some Putty who can make
something go viral totally agree why
would you marry Pros closet over the
pharmacy negotiations because to me it
seems a lot more approachable I can wrap
my mind around it it it falls in line
more with my background that is so funny
because that's the exact reason why I
picked the pharmacy negotiations because
I was like I just know that so much
better than going and repurposing
somebody's newsletter yeah that makes
sense genius all right I love it all
