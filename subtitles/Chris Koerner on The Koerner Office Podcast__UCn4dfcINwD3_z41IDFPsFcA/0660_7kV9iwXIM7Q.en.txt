there's an unfair advantage today if you
know how to use some of these tools you
want to poke holes in that there's no
holes to poke this is going to happen
and someone will make a billion dollars
doing this it's low risk high
probability of success putting it in
your daily workflow is going to pay the
greatest dividends you've probably ever
seen it required a team to create a
product launch a product now you have
people like us sharing how to create
products for nothing all that's required
is motivation can I tell you the tool
that I've been using for the last week
that has probably changed the game for
me from a productivity
[Music]
standpoint what is your go-to you have a
question you move your cursor to a tab
I'm sure you're using all kinds of AIS
but what is your go-to is it open AI is
a deep seek Claude what are we talking
do I look like a deep seek guy to you
Chris no yeah no thank you no as of
February 27th that's when we're
recording this and I say this because
I'm constantly changing my stack my AI

[01:01]
I'm constantly changing my stack my AI
stack you know and I think that's
everyone I think anyone who's making AI
as a part of their workflow like they're
constantly learning like oh my God clo
just dropped 37 I'm gonna go move to
that or perplexity just launched deep
research I'm gonna go use that so my
current stack right now when it comes to
I have a question and I want to figure
out an answer to that question right now
I'm using like deep research for 80% of
my questions and what that means is I'm
going to grock I grock 3 which is just
grock 3 deep research as of recording
this free amazing I use chat GPT Pro
deep research when I want like a little
extra horsepower but it well you're
paying $200 a month but I mean you're
going to pay in time it's going to take
you grock 3 deep research query takes
about a minute or two chat gbt Pro deep
research is going to take 5 to 10
minutes and for like the light stuff I'm
using

[02:00]
using
perplexity still I really like
perplexity I like the UI I know I should
be using Gemini more I just don't no to
me Google's like the the Boomer in the
room Google we know you have all this
data I don't think you're using it right
I think you drop the ball it almost
feels like they're late I've been
playing with the Google stuff a little
bit over the last week and I will say
that it's really good notebook LM how do
you like notebook LM it's really good I
think it's it's like that's their MVP
right like so my hot take on on Google
is I think that they actually are just
you know launching the tip of the
iceberg like I feel like they've they're
probably from a tech perspective like
above and beyond everyone else you know
their incentive is I I don't know how
forward thinking they want to like
launch things right because they have
that search business that's making money
on ads right so I don't know if they
want an AI first world to happen ASAP
but anyways my point is for the average

[03:02]
but anyways my point is for the average
person like we all should be playing
with Gemini because it is really good
how do you like using deep research on
perplexity versus deep research on open
AI deep research on perplexity
feels like it's really good what I like
about it is you can it gets the main
points across and it's the UI again is
just so simple but you know sometimes I
I don't want simple like I don't want
headlines I I want to go deep like you
know they call it deep research for a
reason you know so there's some I'm not
like saying that perplexity is a bad
product or perplexity deep research is a
bad product I'm just saying that when
I'm in the mood for like it's Sunday
morning and I need to go deep on
something I need chat GPT Pro deep
research but if I'm like I've got two
minutes before
meeting and I really wanted to answer
this question but I I don't want like a

[04:00]
this question but I I don't want like a
quick chat GPT or a quick perplexity
answer or quick Rock answer that's what
I'm going to perplexity deep research
yeah I don't know if you probably didn't
see this but about 20 minutes ago I
tweeted about deep research vers
operator on chat GPT and like to me like
operator came out first we made some
videos it was fun to me it's kind of
like a party trick and deep research is
like the the replacement because it's
it's just doing all that in the
background but better but faster without
the API limitations without like all
right you're on Facebook monitor the
window every 5 Seconds like I haven't
touched operator in like two weeks
almost because of deep research the
problem with deep research is The
Branding of deep research like no one
wakes up every morning and it's like wow
I want deep research I think a lot of
people wake up every morning and they're
like I want agents to go and do my work
for me what people don't realize is that
deep research is is still agents like
there there's agents going and scouring

[05:01]
there there's agents going and scouring
the web and and and putting it in a way
and formatting in a way that that is
easy to consume so I think if open AI
launched deep research and called it a
research agent no we wouldn't be talking
everyone would be using them it would be
you know but I think because it's called
Deep research it's just lot less
exciting to the average Joe I mean they
nailed The Branding with operator and
they completely whiffed it with deep
research yeah totally now grock three
big step forward in my opinion do do you
think like I just don't understand how
how companies like Twitter are catching
up so fast with such a smaller data set
I know they have a lot of data but it's
different data like how how is it so
good well it's good data it's really
really good data I mean how you know
Twitter has been around for 20 years
almost almost you know closer to 20 than
10 right I think Twitter came out in
2006 or something we're talking about
billions of tweets and also a lot of new

[06:02]
billions of tweets and also a lot of new
tweets that are super timely so they've
got a really interesting data set so
it's a mix of they've got a really
interesting data set and Elon Musk is
like Elon Musk you know I heard some
crazy stories about him figuring out
ways to get a lot of gpus and creating a
I think they stores them in in Tennesse
and you know making the impossible
possible Elon Musk is is you know this
is not a political statement it's just
like he he's able to do these things
that a lot of other people can't do I
think that's the reason why grock 3 has
become such a good product like I
thought grock 3 was going to suck
honestly yeah it's in the stack it's in
the daily driver is grock pulling from
like e externally outside of Twitter as
well yeah I think so okay because I'm
over here thinking like there's 80
billion websites and open AI is buil on
that and then there's billions of tweets

[07:02]
that and then there's billions of tweets
if grock is pulling from a fraction of
those websites and then I could see how
they could be competitive you could say
that people create websites so it's kind
of like tweets but it's people create
tweets you know I think people are
underestimating how valuable Twitter is
to creating a high quality llm yeah what
do you feel about this thing this
pendant have you looked into these what
is that this is the Limitless pendant
where it records everything I'm like the
total weirdo I wear it everywhere and
people like what is that and I'm like
I'm I'm just like an evangelist cuz I
think it's awesome and I want to record
everything I don't care about privacy
I'm like I don't have privacy whatever I
want to record my whole life and then
like I could write an autobiography with
a prompt or I could ask it you know how
am I a good dad you know based on how I
talk to my kids or am I a piece of crap
husband was that gaslighting you know
like it's just it's just everything I

[08:00]
like it's just it's just everything I
don't understand why more people aren't
taken to it is it because of privacy is
it because it's just too early what do
you think okay walk me through what
Limitless is and yeah this is not an ad
they don't sponsor me but I think it's
cool so they're only on test flight
right now on the App Store so that it is
an iPhone app and then a piece of
Hardware it works well two days battery
life and it's just always listening you
got to keep it within two feet of your
mouth it they just came out with an
update last week that will identify my
voice
so I trained it on my voice but it
doesn't know anyone else's voice it just
says like you and then speaker one
speaker two speaker three and it shows
summaries of conversations and then you
can click into it and open it and it
will show verbatim every single word
spoken and then you can ask it questions
you can say like give me highlights of
my conversation with Nick yesterday or
what were the 10 most funny things said
in my presence yesterday you can't ask
it to cover like a week or multiple days
only day at a time so it's still pretty
early but it just records everything and

[09:02]
early but it just records everything and
I just think that's cool and I don't
even know why I think it's cool yet I
just think it's really going to come in
handy one day I understand why you think
it's cool and I'm a nerd like you at the
same time I really don't want to wear a
device personally so I don't know if
people are watching this on YouTube or
on Spotify and apple but I have a analog
of course you do Casio blacked out you
know cuz I'm wearing an all black out
wow that must have been expensive man
dude you didn't even know we're talking
did you put that on your credit card I
put it on my credit card and let's just
say that I got 100 points it was 56
bucks okay okay wow okay it's a flex
it's a flex right I have an Apple Watch
it's sitting at home collecting dust the
reason is when I'm in front of a
computer I want to be as plugged in as
possible possible and I've got tons of

[10:01]
possible possible and I've got tons of
apps that I'm constantly using lately
I've been using granola the not taking
Ai No taking app things like that but
when I'm away from the computer I don't
want to I don't want a device on me yeah
I just don't that's that's where I'm at
I agree with that my phone my default
setting is do not disturb 247 I have
this watch for running long races but
there's no notifications nothing pushes
to my watch I'm totally in the camp of
like why is it so normal for anyone to
get anyone's attention at any moment in
the day like that should not be normal
or healthy right this at least is not
interactive it's just like a piece of
metal right there's no touchcreen it
doesn't buzz it just records so at least
it has that I think that this is going
to be very temporary eventually you know
my watch will just be recording because
you know if a phone's in your pocket
it's not going to hear I kind of look at
it like I look at biohacking when I
first got into biohacking like all right
let's track everything what's my pulse
oxygen level like what's this this is

[11:00]
oxygen level like what's this this is
and then it's like okay am I getting fat
no do I feel okay it's just the mid whip
meme 8020 right so I'm probably just
like in the middle of that mid whip meme
right now I'm like in my church Church
of Jesus Christ of latterday saints
we're big on U genealogy ancestry um you
know recordkeeping and so it's probably
in My DNA to an extent and my grandkids
probably don't care that I had a
conversation with Greg today you know in
a hundred years I think they will by the
way I think that well because it's you
well no not even I think I'm just
kidding I think if I could go and listen
to my ancestors or people that have
passed like I would pay any amount of
money for that I'm a nerd like that like
I need like I'm I would love to hear
that here's an analogy my mom is a an
avid Journal she has written in her
journal daily her entire life she has
like 150 journals that are this

[12:00]
like 150 journals that are this
and I told like every time I see her I'm
like Mom I got to get your journals I'm
going to scan them I'm going to
transcribe them and I'm going to turn it
into an llm and I can ask it questions
and I she doesn't really care she's you
know it's obviously her journal she
doesn't want it on the internet but when
she dies and I told her this like those
journals are all mine and I just think
it would be cool to be like you know
what what were the 10 biggest trials my
mom experienced when was she the saddest
when was she the happiest and I'm not a
journaler I can't do it I don't want to
but this is like my cheat code to
journaling you know what I'm saying so
some so my kids can do that to me one
day but I will say Greg let me interrupt
myself I'll take the other side of that
argument for a minute it doesn't get
like my insecurities my feelings my
thoughts and that's the important stuff
you know hopefully it can combine with
what I'm doing on my screen it could
make assumptions y y y I hear you I like
I want the the outcome of what you're
doing with the Limitless but I don't
want to actually wear it is kind of
where I'm at it's the same like someone
asked me this morning oh Greg you should

[13:01]
asked me this morning oh Greg you should
totally Vlog more because I was telling
him a story of how I I got invited to
this Billionaire's house this famous
Billionaire's house and all it was a
crazy event just put it that way and he
was like oh man if you would have
vlogged that I'm sure so many people
would wanted to see what it's like to
have met that person and gone for dinner
and seen some of you know the craziness
and I was like yeah but then I'd have to
like take out my phone or have like a
GoPro type thing and I would feel weird
about it I don't know it changes the
dynamic there's there's two types of
people there's people like you who want
to adopt Hardware type devices that
because you believe that the outcome is
worth it like the upside is worth it and
then there's people like me who from a
hardware perspective like software I'll
try anything like I will try anything
but from a hardware persp persective I'm

[14:00]
but from a hardware persp persective I'm
really if I'm going to purchase a piece
of Hardware or even if someone wants to
give it to me I need to make sure that
the upside of it is absolutely massive
okay that's fair that's fair that's
where I'm at yeah understood are there
any like interesting kind of gimmicky AI
wrappers or just like these any
interesting tools that you're working
with nowadays that that are really cool
or interesting either from a user
consumer perspective or from a business
perspective can I tell you the tool that
I've been using for the last week that
has probably changed the game for me
from a productivity standpoint yes
please there's an app called whisper
flow have you heard about it it sounds
familiar but I don't know anything about
it I always used to make fun of the
person that would transcribe their voice
you know go into the notes app and be
like Siri like take this note you know
note for Uncle does that I I it was the
it is the by far the most Boomer thing

[15:01]
it is the by far the most Boomer thing
of all time I always saw it and I was
like how do you look yourself in the
mirror honestly until I discovered
whisper flow whisper flow it uses AI to
basically transcribe what you what
you're saying and it does so in a way
that is a magical experience I remember
the first time I tried chat GPT and and
I queried it and I got an answer and I
was like it was an aha moment I had the
same
with whisper flow my friend told me to
try it and then we started texting back
and forth through voice I would record
it and I would just say like hey like
glad you're having a good time on
vacation and you know I hope to see you
soon and thanks for sending me that
picture of my niece or whatever it is it
was the aha moment because it was
literally perfect the commas were
perfect it took out when I said
literally or took out when I said like
or and now I'm using it everywhere I use
whisper flow everywhere when people get
slack messages from me it's likely

[16:02]
slack messages from me it's likely
whisper flow so thinking about how you
use voice as a part of your
day-to-day I was never thinking about
voice I've introduced voice into my
day-to-day and people think that you
know I'm sending these long slack
messages that are like really well
thought out of in the past what I would
be doing is like on liners because I
didn't have the time to write right
right right and format format format
with whisper flow and again I'm not like
I'm involved in whisper I just think
that didn't use voice now I use voice
we've gotten to the place where like
Siri isn't good let's be real but with
llms and AI something like whisper
whisper flow is a GameChanger so it
basically takes what you can already do
an iMessage and it just levels it up it
everywhere on your iPhone exactly you
can like whisper to it literally like
you don't even need yeah you don't need
you know Siri it's like okay Siri or hey
Siri and you got to like
literally oh my Siri like went off you

[17:03]
literally oh my Siri like went off you
literally have
to grab a loudspeaker and blast your
message into it for it to hear but for
with whisper flow you just quietly say
it and it's going to pick up on it okay
that's a good one I'm going to try that
and it's it like embedded in your
keyboard or it's a standalone app
exactly it's cool because it also like
it'll like bullet out like let's say I'm
sending a slack message to someone
sometimes you know I'll say a paragraph
or I'll just start talking to it and
it'll just format it in a way that it's
easy for the recipient to understand
that's a good one what else anything
else you're playing with I'm trying to
think of like nonobvious ones or maybe
not even ones that you're using but ones
that you've seen in the wild that kind
of make you go huh oh that could be an
interesting business or that's a stupid
idea but it has 100K Mr its second month
I brought up granola have you used
granola I use uh fathom yeah team uses
fathom when you go to granola it's

[18:02]
fathom when you go to granola it's
granola.bar
oh sorry go ahead I was going to say
like with all these AI note taking apps
we take all these notes everyone's
taking notes are you ever going back and
reading them like honestly and it's the
same Principle as this thing I'm wearing
yeah you know like if I never read this
stuff what's the point well if you're
never going to read it there's no point
there isn't and that's why dude I've
been I I'll say it I'll admit it I'm not
a notaker me either I'm not a notaker
never was never will be in school I
always thought it was like I was guy to
like there's a girl in the class and I'd

[19:01]
like there's a girl in the class and I'd
be like you know next to me and and I'd
make friends with her or a guy you know
there's just one girl in particular I'm
thinking of that I just went through so
many grades with and she was like my
note girl she took the most meticulous
notes I was like be become friends with
the notaker now I don't become friends
with the notaker I'm not sure that I
need the notes if I do need the notes
even if it's once a month or once every
three months it's worth it for that I
think it's almost like note taking is
one of life's coping mechanisms to make
us feel good about like not really
knowing the material or it's kind of
like you know I'm going to eat pizza for
lunch but I drank my athletic greens
this morning so I'm good you know it's
like is you're checking a box and I use
faom like I use a note taker but I never
ever go back and read them but it's good
to have it's kind of like a form of
insurance I guess it's a form it's
schmuck Insurance yeah yeah that's what
it is so video is cool but you know
what's better long form audio via
podcast and my newsletter TKO pod.com go
there to subscribe for free to my

[20:00]
there to subscribe for free to my
newsletter it's one email a week very
tactical and then go to my audio podcast
three episodes a week stuff like this
you're going to love it all free no
sleazy sales TKO pod.com what are
you excited about well I want to talk
about one more tool that is one more AI
tool actually if that's okay that I've
been obsessed with over the last week or
two which is have you played with gum
loop I keep hearing about it from
everyone so there's must be something to
it a lot of people oh yes okay yes yeah
a lot of people chief of is using it
yeah a lot of people would will go to
gum Loop like a lot of people in the
tech world will go to gum loop I think
it's gum loop.com and they'll be like
I've seen this before I've seen zapier
I've seen M I've seen Lindy AI yeah and
you're right you have like granola gum
Loops UI is just a lot more beautiful so
if you're someone like me who really
values like beautiful
experiences and you're you're just going
to retain better on gum Loop and you're

[21:02]
to retain better on gum Loop and you're
going to end up doing more and you're
going to be able to automate more of
your business using it so I've been
having fun just like building flows on
gum Loop and you're talking to a guy
who's like used every like played a lot
with zappier played a lot with make
played a lot with all of these and
wasn't the guy who would actually finish
them like I would start a lot of things
and come up with a lot of ideas and then
I would have to go to my team and be
like do you mind just like hooking this
stuff up same you know yeah but with G
gum loop I think what's really cool
about it is a lot of people are actually
gonna finish them start to finish what
cool flows do you use with gum Loop
today a lot of like
scraping data and putting it into Google
Docs or Google Sheets yeah just finding
data organizing data curating data
presenting that data to the right member
of our team at the right time
to me that's the most interesting what's

[22:02]
to me that's the most interesting what's
cool about it is if you scrape data and
you put it into let's say a Google
Sheets you can use intelligence you know
in between there right so you can say
like okay here's all this data that I
scraped from you know the best Cuban
food in Miami and then you can use
intelligence to be like okay here's
here's what the internet says which is
basically like highly ranked SEO
articles which by the way not be the
best like just because it's on a list
and it's ranked number one doesn't mean
it's actually the best kubano for
example and then you can use
intelligence and you can pick which llm
you want to use to actually add to that
edit it challenge it put it
into some sort of cloud software that
you know your team could see and then
you create like slack Bots and stuff
like that that notifies people I just
think that the concept of when people
say they want AI what they really when

[23:00]
say they want AI what they really when
business people say they want AI I think
a lot of the times they actually really
want automation but the word AI is just
a lot more sexy than automation zapier
has had an open AI integration for like
two years now but it's it's just clunky
and zapier breaks all the time Here's a
thought we started a business not even a
business we built a programmatic SEO
site a year ago for Pet Cremations did I
tell you about this already no yeah
because like there's there's more
puppies than than kids nowadays there's
all these animals there's only a few
hundred pet cremation facilities but the
demand for cremation is going through
the roof and so the thesis was you know
in all these far-flung cities there's no
there's no one starting a horse
cremation facility because there's not
enough demand but there's still people
searching for it so we called it animal
after care and this was really more of a
a test a programmatic SEO learning
experience we built it a year ago we
didn't touch it and I get calls on my
personal phone every hour from people

[24:02]
personal phone every hour from people
wanting to cremate a thorough bread in
uname city in the United States or
Canada and it's really interesting
because I saw a guy on Twitter doing
this uh with other keywords and he
basically finds keywords on the Google
Keyword tool that have high search
volume low competition and then he's
using repet to build a programmatic SEO
site and so what is stopping anyone
doing a Mad Dash a gold rush if if you
will of taking all those like high
volume low competition and high ticket
orthopedic surgery for for example and
just spinning up hundreds or thousands
of programmatic SEO sites you do it once
in repet and then you copy paste over
and over same design different keyword
5,000 landing pages per website and just
aggregating countless leads and then
selling the whole thing to private
Equity to the biggest player in the
market or just selling the leads you
know poke in that there's no holes to
poke this is going to happen and someone

[25:02]
poke this is going to happen and someone
will make a billion dollars doing this
this happened thank you in Web 2.0 ERA
with I don't know if you remember a
company called demand media demand media
basically would use started in 2006 they
would use algorithms to identify topics
with high advertising potential based on
search engine query data and bids on
Advertising auctions so it's basically a
lot of of you know advice in how to
websites so for example you might have
heard of ehow.com started through demand
media okay I have I just didn't know was
called the man media I've heard of these
guys yes so they are credited with
spearheading this idea around a Content
Farm before them the idea of a Content
Farm didn't really exist on the internet
the idea that you'd hire writers to
write in a in one of these niches based
on Google Trends data and keyword data

[26:04]
on Google Trends data and keyword data
like this is content Farm 2.0 I think
that there's going to be a demand media
of our generation of this generation
demand media wasn't a small business by
any stretch it I think in it's Heyday
half a billion dollars a year in Revenue
like we're talking serious revenue and
this was like pretty early you know mid
2000s right so that's a lot Arbitrage at
scale it's Arbitrage at scale and it's
never been easier like we will have such
an easier time doing this than demand
media ever did with these tools yeah I
think if I was in college right now this
would be something I would be doing I'm
gonna share my screen this is our Google
search console for animal Aftercare we
had it at animal- aftercare
for animala care.com and started

[27:00]
for animala care.com and started
transferring all the traffic but look at
like I I I go weeks at a time forgetting
that I own this business other than the
fact that these calls come in because we
don't do anything we're not selling the
leads we're not doing anything with them
and look at all these keywords that
we're ranking for private cremation for
Cats pet cremation West coina like
because we have 5,000 landing pages in
the in the states which is five keywords
across the top 10,000 cities by
population and then same for Canada top
100 cities in Canada five keywords pet
cremation dog cremation pet youth in
Asia dog youth in Asia horse cremation
and we're just ranking and we just
picked a random thing but you could do
this with thousands of keywords yeah
what I love about this is it's it's
lowrisk high probability of success I
mean the hard part it's figuring out I
mean you got to use like HS or or
something like that to figure out the
opportunity zones if you can get the
right domain I actually think that a do
domain and single two-word English

[28:03]
domain and single two-word English
dictionary Doom domains are going to be
more valuable in an AI world so there's
a whole Arbitrage there I mean we've got
like a programmatic SEO agency we
invested in a programmatic SEO agency
because we were like this is the there's
going to be a huge opportunity to build
businesses on top of these keywords it's
called boring marketing.com and I've
just been able to see firsthand like the
right programmatic approach approach how
well it works and then you marry that
with this prompt to software movement
that's happening and it's amazing so I
think that this is a window in time
opportunity I don't know how long it
lasts but for right now it's definitely
a huge idea so I'll take two sides to
that argument I completely agree but as
far as how long does it last like you
ever seen that Viral Reddit post that
says it's all priced in of course it's
classic right so it's like here's my
version of that we're always early

[29:00]
version of that we're always early
everything's early right we're so early
like we're we're early on crypto we're
early on e-commerce we're early on AI
like you don't know if you're early or
late until the history of the human race
has played out already right so early is
relative to how long that thing will be
around are we early on laser discs no
like it's behind us right but like let's
let's talk about Roll-Ups right rolling
up marinas and dsos dental offices and
like there's thousands of Industries
micro Industries and sub Industries to
roll up that we're going to be rolling
up you know gutter cleaning businesses
in 15 years there just because the sheer
number of things there are to roll up
right and then in 15 years there's going
to be hundreds of new industries that we
don't even know about yet right so when
it comes to Opportunities like this on
one hand I completely agree if you take
like braces near me like someone's going
to build a programmatic site for that if
they haven't already and they're going
to be they're going to be number one
just like Uber's number one they're
going to have 80% market share and then
a bunch of other people will fill in the

[30:01]
a bunch of other people will fill in the
20% right so you know we're probably
late for that but there's so many
different keywords so many different
combinations of keywords that even
though we are early for the best maybe
the biggest opportunities I think this
is still an opportunity in five or 10
years yeah so here's the way I think
about it was it easier to launch in
iPhone app in 2009
2011 right after the App Store came out
yeah absolutely it it was easier does
that mean that you can't launch an app
in 2025 or 2024 like the Cal AI guys and
make a million dollars a month or
whatever it is they're making no of
course you can still launch a mobile app
today and still do really well the
difference between mobile and this world
we live in now is there was back then it
required a team to create a product and
launch a product and go to market and

[31:01]
launch a product and go to market and
often times you actually have to raise
money to go and do that now you have
people like us sharing how to create
products for products for nothing and
all that really required is some
motivation honestly all that's required
is motivation that's literally it it's
true yeah there is just going to be by
that you know a lot more competition
because there's a lot of motivated
people out there I understand what
you're saying and I agree with you that
you're early even in 2032 you'll be
early and there'll be opportunities to
build something but as a whole it's
definitely easier to win today than I
think it will be in 10 years from now I
agree and another thing though that I
would say is if you know we're talking
about programmatic SEO and building
stuff like this on repet right and so in
that sense you you don't have to raise
money you don't have to hire a team so
it's going to get more competitive more
saturated faster right but on the other
hand the fact that AI has opened up so

[32:00]
hand the fact that AI has opened up so
many other opportunities that have
nothing to do with even websites or
programmatic SEO all the enterprising
entrepreneurs out there we're just
chasing so many more rabbits now the pie
is so much bigger that I feel like it's
it's proportional you know what I'm
saying like even though you don't have
to raise money even like it's still it
just kind of it's a wash it offsets I
want to believe what you're saying is
true you know and a past version of me
would say don't worry about it
you know when the time is right there's
still going to be
opportunity and I agree but like the
reality is there's an unfair advantage
today if you know how to use some of
these tools yeah and put stuff out there
you could have bought Real Estate in
Manhattan in
1907 when there was a lot less
competition you can still make money
buying Real Estate in Manhattan today
it's just a lot harder and the price is
a lot more that do that you want to buy
like once people realize that buying

[33:00]
like once people realize that buying
these Dooms and and the keywords are are
sort of worth it I'm going to guess that
a lot of the prices of Dooms are going
to go up yeah yeah agreed and if nothing
else this is kind of intangible but like
you just act now because the the more
you wait before acting the more likely
you are to never act so just do it now
do it now that's just bias for Action is
just best practices regardless and do it
now because you're going to suck for a
while and and by the time 2028 rolls
around or 2027 rolls around you'll be
good yeah yep yeah I don't really get
the people that are like yeah I'll just
wait until like the tools get easier or
you know oh I used chat gbt and it
didn't really work that well it's like
no no no like this all these tools
putting it in your daily workflow is
going to pay the greatest dividends
you've probably ever seen yeah agreed
when it comes to the repats of the world
bolt wind surf what are your go-tos for

[34:00]
bolt wind surf what are your go-tos for
trying to build an app prompt to code I
think bolt and and lovable are great
places for non-technical people to to
begin with Bolt's a client of our design
agency LCA so I just have a little more
love for that you know I went to CS
school and I dropped out but I only had
three classes left so I have like a
decent understanding of like technical
infrastructure and and how to think
about these things so cursor to me
doesn't feel for a lot of people I think
they'll use it and they'll be like this
is overwhelming but to me it doesn't
feel unknown I also really like cursor
what about the last like I feel like the
last mile is just as hard as it's ever
been like I can whip up something and
repl it so fast but then it's like it
still doesn't work it looks really cool
what have you found any solutions to
that to me it's like it does its trick
which is to me I need get something out
and deployed and stuff might be wonky or

[35:01]
and deployed and stuff might be wonky or
not working great but if I can validate
that there's demand and I'm like okay
great then I can go and hire you know
one two three developers to take it the
last mile today is is still humans in my
opinion will that be forever no but as
of recording this I do believe that you
do need a human to I mean it depends on
what you want to create like you're just
creating like lining Pages or a basic s
at may you know maybe you can just do it
yourself but once you start getting
into a lot of different features and a
more heavy software application having a
human in the loop is probably a good
idea I don't know if it's just because
I'm an idiot or what not but I'm I have
like six projects in repa right now and
I can't close any of them out i' I've
hired some bounties but still even
they're not figuring it out so I do
think that there needs to be some sort
of like school for this you know like I

[36:01]
of like school for this you know like I
feel like there's so many people who
have a graveyard of repet ideas or or
cursor ideas that are like 90% there and
I think that I wish there was like a
modern-day business school that people
can like go and go online and I wish it
was free that people can like learn to
actually like know enough technical
knooow to take it home but I just I
think that the tools aren't there just
yet all right so you got any business
ideas for us I mean I always have
business ideas I have a notes file Apple
notes where it's just called ideas and
I've got a million ideas so let me just
pull it up any category or just anything
that excites you today I'll give this
one to you and your
audience I don't know if it's an idea as
as is an Insight but when I first moved
to Miami when I was walking and I saw a

[37:02]
to Miami when I was walking and I saw a
dental office and in the window it said
best dentist in America 2020 and they
had this big plaque and I I looked at it
and then I looked inside the dental
office and I was like oh it's a clean
dental office it's one of the best you
know confirmation bias yeah exactly one
of the best dentists in America I
deserve a great dentist you know and so
I walk in and I was like are you guys
taking customers Lo and beh whole
thousands of dollars later lots of
cleanings later referred probably 25
people there I'm a customer and a good
customer now is she the best dentist in
America like probably not but it got me
thinking that there's a huge opportunity
to sell like basically sell plaques my
initial idea was selling almost like how
product hunt has like product of the day
number one what if you can sell some
accreditation to startups any Niche or

[38:01]
accreditation to startups any Niche or
you start with one Niche do you think I
was thinking just like startups in
general and it could be as simple as
like product of the year or product you
know product yeah product of the year
it's like yeah and you can put this like
badge on your website and the reality is
that's going to increase conversion and
in a sea of AI startups like you kind of
want to stand out so it's like are you
willing to pay
$200 so that you could have that on your
website and it's going to convert more
and also like optimize it around people
like doing unboxings of physical award
like that's worth $200 so you know and
you know who does this really well is
YouTube their 100,000 Subs like did you
get one I did yeah I got one right there
you got one too right yeah I got one
yeah it's nice see we're talking about
it I know right all right I like this
idea and I'm gonna I'm gonna hopefully
level it up a bit okay yeah so like AI

[39:02]
level it up a bit okay yeah so like AI
tool directories out there you probably
see them right different categories chat
Bots whatever so it could be something
like that a directory and you could have
like a silent auction where you I get a
cold email let's say I have a I have an
app that I just released and I scrape
product hunt this business scrapes
product hunt and they email me the owner
of this new app and they're like hey we
want to add you to our directory
congratulations we nominated you for
product of the year now this is it gets
a little gets a little iffy here okay
let's say there's 20 people on this
category of the directory it's a silent
auction and they bid who wants to be
number one and whoever bids the most is
number one whoever bids second most is
number two and then they get a physical
plaque mail to them so it's a total
racket but according to this random
website that no one's heard of but that
doesn't matter that's just the fine
print they are product of the year I
mean this is a a very easy one to $3
million a year business like super high

[40:00]
million a year business like super high
margins don't need a big team I like
that it could expand to different
categories I'm bullish on the trend of
like accreditation basically yeah like
something in the age of AI you're saying
like a human stamp of approval or just
kind of going the opposite direction of
AI That's right I think I always try to
think about that around when you're
coming up with startup ideas and you see
a trend or Paradigm Shift like AI you
have to be like okay what are my
favorite AI ideas and you like List It
Out by priority and then you're like
okay what are my favorite anti-ai ideas
and then you List It Out by priority so
that's how that like barbell strategy is
is something I think a lot about yeah I
like it what about an agent so you see
right there I've got the YouTube plaque
and the Shopify plaque both smart an
agent that basically links up with
Twitter anytime someone posts a picture
or tweet TW or something about their
Shopify or YouTube plaque the agent goes

[41:01]
Shopify or YouTube plaque the agent goes
and does a deep dive on that person or
that business how did they get there
when did their Shopify store open it
looks at the web archive it looks at all
these tools that already exist to just
do this reverse engineering Deep dive of
the YouTube channel or the Shopify store
or whatever it is and then presents a
clean little nice report here's how to
copy this business or here's how to
launch your own Shopify store based on
how this random store did it in only 97
days or whatever is I like that a lot
and the beauty is you can use tools like
gum Loop that's scrape and and write the
Articles and write the breakdowns you
probably put like a newsletter on top of
it too get people to subscribe for like
a weekly breakdown or something like
that that's a good one it' be a paid
newsletter where hey we don't know if
someone's going to post about this three
times a day three times a month but as
soon as they do about seven minutes
later you're going to have an email in
your inbox of exactly how to do that
that's a good one what is that company

[42:00]
that's a good one what is that company
that raised like $50 million for their
sales agent there like like 10 it's
crazy to me the agents raising all this
money yeah it's it's wild I'm writing
I'm gonna post this newsletter it's all
about this idea called Vibe Revenue
where can we find that newsletter to
read it Greg Eisenberg decom okay Vibe
Revenue what is that just like we're
hopping on the gravy train well you know
what it was I tweeted the other day I
had like too much coffee and I tweeted
I'm usually not this spicy but I said
fine I'll say the thing that no one is
saying there's a bunch of AI companies
with1 to10 million AR raising big VC
money on what I'll call curiosity
Revenue not real sustainable AR
basically what's happening right now is
a lot of people have high willingness to
try AI products they sign up for a free
trial convert but it's just temporary
Revenue spikes that don't look like
product Market fit and I wrote a whole
long post about so smart
and it got me thinking about this

[43:00]
and it got me thinking about this
concept called Vibe Revenue which is
like people people have been talking
about Vibe coding which is like using
tools like bolt and cursor and repet to
like one prompt to software but I think
the other side of it is there's a lot of
apps software companies that are that
are being put out there that frankly
like it's just they're calling it ARR
but it's like people are just window
shopping you know they're just trying it
out yeah it's like it's a sugar high
it's a sugar high and that which is
easily gained is easily lost right
that's right exactly the harder way is
usually the better way yeah so I'm I've
been thinking about that a lot it's
really top of mind like how do you
create an indispensable business and try
to like avoid the hype so I think a lot
of people are going to be listening to
to this and they listen to you know or
they're on Twitter or X just seeing
other people posting and they're going
to be they're going to feel the fomo to
build AI businesses it's good to feel
fomo in some sense because it increases

[44:00]
fomo in some sense because it increases
motivation which I think is is a really
positive side effect of
fomo but it's bad if people end up
creating a bunch of businesses companies
that they take other people's money and
they end up chasing these sugar highs
when the reality is there's no need to
chase sugar highs when there's so many
indispensable businesses sustainable
businesses that people be creating today
and if they're listening to this or you
on your podcast they should have no
shortage of ideas I mean come on no I
mean don't give me that I can't come up
with an idea yeah I don't want to hear
it just literally ask chpd for ideas
