all right it is Friday which means
another episode of holdco Bros with Nick
and I we talked a lot about print shops
today print shops are one of those
businesses industries that no one's
really looking at they're ugly it's CeX
heavy but they can do really really well
so we talk about a bunch of business
ideas around the prince shop industry
for some reason we just kept gravitating
back to that industry we talked about
starting a group purchasing organization
a GPO for industries that you might not
otherwise think of and then the last
segment which is my favorite we talked
about selling very very expensive widget
to Airline manufacturers because you
have to be FAA registered so there's
some red tape there which means there's
not nearly enough competition there I
think you really like that one enjoy
please like And subscribe share with
your friends and we'll see you next
[Music]
time I'm coaching a guy right now and
he's a boomer but he's awesome I like
him a lot he lives in San Antonio okay
and he's got two things going for him
number
one he owns a print shop like your
typical Boomer owned print shop uh he's

[01:00]
typical Boomer owned print shop uh he's
doing a lot of the work he gives quotes
over the phone business cards Flyers you
name it it's a little over a million
dollars a year in revenue and he's
acquiring other print shops which is
really really interesting that could be
a whole other conversation I I kind of
look at it like an accounting practice
right he's just like buying customers he
doesn't have to integrate all these
employees he uses his own equipment he's
just buying a recurring customer
database and like nobody wants to buy a
print shop I'm going off on a tangent
this isn't what I wanted to talk about
but nobody wants to buy a print shop
it's not sexy like most of them make
like 50 Grand a year in profit therefore
the multiples are like 2x 2 and a half X
but like this guy's basically rolling
them up without even realizing it that's
interesting we can talk about that later
but he's doing two interesting things
maybe three he's rolling up print
shops he's uh growing his print shop and
he just invented a product and so I want
to talk about him growing The Print Shop
real quick so

[02:00]
real quick so
his website is static it's on WordPress
and 50% of websites are on WordPress and
when I say it's static it's not like
Vista Print it's like all right how many
business cards do you want what color do
you want rounded edges like an
interactive quote generation tool he
doesn't have one and he said he used to
spend literally eight hours a day just
giving custom quotes over the phone jeez
still a good business like 25% net
margins making good money and then he
just took all of his prices and put he
spent like a whole day putting him in a
price sheet like a basically a
spreadsheet and then gave him to one of
his team members and that cut his time
like by 80% but even still someone is
spending hours a day generating these
quotes for random print jobs because
there's a zillion different things you
can print right and so we were just
talking and he's like man I really wish
I could get someone to just make my
website interactive I don't want a new
website I just want people to be able to

[03:00]
website I just want people to be able to
generate their own quotes like Vista
Print and he listed off a few other
websites and I was like well dude I can
help you with that well you know how to
you know how to build websites I'm like
no I'll just go to upwork real quick
I'll post a job and I'll get a quote for
you and I'll just hand over the virtual
assistant and he's like okay good
because I've been getting quotes for
this and they're outrageous I'm like
what are we talking 30 grand 20 grand
grand5 30 grand yeah and he's like 30
grand yeah what are they building
they
just.gov like what the
freak yeah and so he's like I would pay
five grand for this like I think it's
very much worth five grand and I was
like dude I agree but it's not even
going to cost that much and so I helped
them out I posted upwork got a bunch of
quotes $500 $5,000 everything in between
here's the idea basically web agencies
are not new like agencies are not this
is an agency but I more specifically

[04:02]
is an agency but I more specifically
there are 23,000 print shops in the US I
did a little cursory research and I
would bet that 90 plus percent of them
are not interactive probably 90% have a
website and 90% of those are not
interactive and there's a world where
you could find a VA have them build an
interactive tool and then have that same
VA copy and paste the interactive tool
on print shop websites and charge two
three four grand for it one time plus a
little bit a month to maintain things
what do we think all right there's a
couple things that I really like about
this the first thing is that you threw
in so there's this guy that I'm coaching
I love it now everybody who's listening
knows that you coach and you're going to
make a lot more money I'm coaching
exactly one guys right
now because it's not something I do and
17 girls no dude so we looked at a print
shop like two years ago oh yeah we did
Alabama yeah I liked him at the time
because I I I get it that they're unsexy

[05:00]
because I I I get it that they're unsexy
but the printing equipment does cost a
lot of money so like there is a barrier
to entry from that standpoint you have
to spend a lot of money on Capital
expenditures you could lease the
equipment but it's still expensive to
get the print shop up and running which
is also one reason why they they're good
to buy right and not start from scratch
exactly when you said he's rolling them
up maybe I missed this part but he's not
buying print shops so how like how is he
rolling them up he basically is so he
knows like all the competitors town and
they're like hey I'm retiring I'm done
do you want to buy my business well I
don't need that machine or that I don't
need your building like I want your
customers and so they're just like
selling the assets and then seller
financing the business/ customers at
really low multiples he doesn't have to
take on any employees no new processes
he just starts printing those jobs
because a lot of these people are
wedding planners they just come back for
jobs every month it goes back in line
with what we were talking about a week
or two ago where this is like a perfect

[06:00]
or two ago where this is like a perfect
lead magnet right remember when we were
talking about going and building a lead
magnet business where you just find
these businesses and you're like hey I
could build this lead magnet for you
maybe it's one step more than a lead
magnet but to me it's a lead magnet
right it's like hey you're interested in
how much your print job would cost fill
out this thing and they click on it and
they click through it and then in order
to get the quote they've got to put
their email in so it becomes like a warm
lead and you like we were talking about
you build it once and easily replicate
it to tons of print shops around the
country that are probably in a similar
situation because again you're printing
these physical Goods they're not really
disrupted by AI you have like the same
customers every year it's the high
school who's printing the banners it's
the business that needs to put up poster
like it's kind of the same companies
that are buying these things so they
don't really their websites are static
because they don't necessarily need
quote unquote the lead magnet but I
think that's why there is such
opportunity for those companies that
create the lead magnet is because
nobody's catering to it so there's a
huge opportunity to capture that

[07:00]
huge opportunity to capture that
business and shift them especially
because you don't have to have a
printing shop that's like in your town
you could have a printing shop in St
Louis Missouri and you just print custom
stuff and you acquire people online from
all over the country and then ship it to
them that's perfectly normal for print
shops so I really like the idea for all
those reasons I think you could go even
more Niche you could say your agency
website could say we make print shops
built on WordPress Interactive
that's it like only WordPress because
that makes it so efficient on your end
uh only print shops and then but the
name of the business is something more
generic and then over time you could add
Auto Body restaurants anything like
barber shops anything that needs a more
interactive feature on the website we
can't talk about an idea without talking
about the distribution strategy
right yes but but before you do that yes
how do you see this as different than
the lead gen kind of idea that we were
talking
about the lead magnet that you just

[08:00]
about the lead magnet that you just
referenced yes the lead magnet right
like to me it's kind of the same thing
right well like to me if I need business
cards printed and I land on a local
print Shop's website I'm very high
intent and I just want to know how much
that costs so I think by nature of what
it is it is a lead magnet right like you
could make the decision on do we want
the email at the beginning or at the end
of the form do you want to optimize this
as a way to save your time quoting jobs
or do you want to make this a lead
magnet it's both what do you prefer
right what's your strategy I think it's
both and this one because it's a tool
that you're using to quote it's probably
going to be a higher ticket item than
just a lead magnet because a lead magnet
is going to be generic I got a lead
coming in I still have to talk them
qualify them see what they want whereas
this is a tool that's actually
creating a custom quote for somebody
who's looking for specific
Services yeah so I would just go reverse
engine know what Vista print's doing
they don't require you to give any

[09:00]
they don't require you to give any
information before giving you a quote
they probably assume that you're going
to buy right it's like too much friction
at a certain point I think the way that
you could acquire customers here is
something I like to call and when I say
I like to call it I mean I'm calling it
this for the first time in my
life so something I like to
call Great or good bait and switching
okay oh okay he he took something crappy
which is bait and switching but he
called it the greater good so it must be
good
yeah it's an oxymoron yeah ethical bait
and switching so there are Bots that can
basically go to websites like this and
they go to all the contact forms and
just send a generic message right I did
this for LCD cycle when we were looking
for iPhone repair customers and so you
can use a bot or you can use a virtual
assistant you scrape all the websites
using builtwith and you say all the ones
that have a contact usest form just put
this message in there with my name email
and phone number and here's the message
you ready I'm ready Freddy

[10:00]
you ready I'm ready Freddy
hey I was wanting to get a quote on some
business cards but I didn't see your
your quote
generator that's it like I have a
problem that's not being solved and then
if they get back to you they're going to
say oh I can give you a quote over the
phone and then it's oh you're still
doing that oh I can help you fix that so
it's like they think it's an interested
customer but it's not does that piss
people off honestly let's say I'm the
business on and it's like I get your
inquiry oh hey yeah cool what can I help
you what can I do you for what you
looking to buy yeah I I would just start
into my sales pitch okay let's hear the
sales pitch are you saying if I called
people and said this I'm doing a role
play here Chris I get you I got
distracted in my head and started
thinking about something else okay okay
I'm the business owner I get you you're
gonna need to say that again I get
this your fault this is all your fault I

[11:02]
this your fault this is all your fault I
love the Gast lighting I'm the business
owner I get Outreach hey can I use your
tool oh hey hey Chris we don't have a
tool but I can quote you over the phone
oh okay you I'm sorry you don't have an
interactive widget on your website I'm
sorry I'm just confused we love
personalized customer service you ever
see that episode of the office with
Michael Scott when he was competing
against Staples to win a large account
and how he lost that large account but
then he got it back because he was able
to show customized service when he
called his re picked up and it was Pam
okay that's us we provide customized
local service okay sorry is your name
Greg or Gary because if you're white 65y
old Boomer I'm gonna assume it's one of
the two is it Gary or Greg my name is
Gary Greg middle name is Greg first name
Gary Gary Greg let me answer your
question with another question would you
rather be a publicly traded company like
Staples or Dunder Mifflin ran by Michael
Scott okay you know what you just
offended me and I'm not going to sell to
you
now oh no so your question is a great

[12:01]
now oh no so your question is a great
one and it's valid and I will say yes it
will anger a minority of people but it
is a net win an example of this is I got
an A DM on Instagram from this kid that
was like 13 years old and he's like hey
Chris do you offer any High tick
coaching sales because I would love to
buy from you and I'm like oh I know
exactly what this is so I responded to
him and I I get I see a bunch of these
but for some reason I just wanted to
pick on this kid I was like oh let me
guess you're going to wet my appetite by
pretending like you're about to give me
$5,000 but really you just want to sell
a high tick coaching service to me so I
can sell High ticket coaching services
to my followers right and he responded
and he's like you got me you got
me he's like but he's like I've AB
tested all the Outreach methods and this
one by far crushes so is he really 13
though I thought that was gonna be the
bait and switch he looked very young but
is like catfishing you yeah

[13:00]
is like catfishing you yeah
so but it works what you're saying is
the ethical bait switching works and
that's how you would reach out to these
like the distribution makes sense to me
that seems like a fairly easy list to
scrape yeah so it would basically be hey
I'm interested in some business cards
but I didn't see the interactive form oh
we don't have one let me get you on the
the the phone and then either you get
them on the phone right then and Pitch
them that could be a little hairier or
you could respond and say okay awesome
the reason I asked is because I offer
this this as a service and you know
leads go up by 38% and you'd actually be
surprised by how little this costs it's
not as expensive as you think it's not a
site redesign we're just adding a widget
to your website I'm gonna take your idea
I'm GNA layer on another thing I don't
know if this will work but my mind goes
to programmatic SEO could you just build
some programmatic SEO to capture people
who are looking for printing pricing and
then sell those leads to local print
shops 1 million % right because then you

[14:00]
shops 1 million % right because then you
build you build a tool like they come
they get it quoted and like yeah you may
not know obviously you're not going to
know everybody's pricing but maybe you
price it at a level that makes sense
that you feel like is like overpriced I
don't know you capture all those leads
and you build out like a network of
print shops that you're able to then
send those leads to that they purchase
from all right if you are watching this
clip right now you are watching this on
YouTube and if you are a fan of podcast
please check out my podcast while you're
at it because sometimes I have podcasts
that aren't on YouTube and sometimes I
have YouTubes that aren't on podcast so
check out the ker office on any podcast
platform or you can go to TKO pod.com
also my newsletter will throw that in
there there are no ads It's weekly it's
different content than my podcast and
YouTube newsletter. chrisj cerner.com
You'll see the link and we'll see you
there Counterpoint okay you don't build
out a network of print shops because
that by far will be the hardest part
about this business you go to Minuteman
Press which is a nationwide franchise
hundreds of locations you go to the one
decision maker there and sell all the
leads to them and or you go to Vista

[15:00]
leads to them and or you go to Vista
Print and sell the leads to them two
decision makers instead of 2,000 but I
love that idea there's a like think of
all this search traffic like insert any
type of thing needed to be printed
multiply by any Market any city state
region zip code yeah and you've got tons
and tons of search volume tons tons dude
I just got a business idea off of this
you got a business idea off of our
business idea yeah like I'm changing
directions here is is that cool please
all right this won't work for most
businesses I don't know actually I'm
just going to say it but one of the
things that you want to do when you're
buying a business is like you want to
understand not only like how good is the
business right how well is it running
how old is it what's the team like yada
yada but you also want to get an idea of
how well how much you can grow that
business how much upside of opportunity
there is within that business and an
example that I will give is an example
that we have done in the past we were
looking at buying an RV park and we
wanted to test demand for the upside
right we knew what the rents were and we

[16:01]
right we knew what the rents were and we
wanted to know what we could raise them
to and so what did we do is we went on
Facebook Marketplace placed ads at
different price points and we just saw
did we get any hits and based on the
response that we got it validated our
idea that like we could triple rent with
this park and so was it we more than
willing to pay for the price that they
were asking for and that was just like
one testing method this would be a
company that essentially you maybe you
partner with private Equity or maybe you
partner with Searchers like this would
be like a perfect kind of Searcher
partnership and you help them forecast
and test Demand with these types of
services so let's say I'm a Searcher and
I'm going to buy this company a print
shop right and they come to you and
they're like hey I know what the
business is like currently but I need to
know over the next five years like what
I can project and what the market looks
like I need you to run a one-month test
for me to see what demand would look
like if I decided to go online and like
we already have the systems in place and
so we build out a programmatic SEO or we
post ad somewhere and we just get

[17:00]
post ad somewhere and we just get
inbound and and we go to them and maybe
we have like two leads with $1,000 of AD
spend or maybe we have 500 leads with
$1,000 of AD spend but then we're able
to go to them and say like yeah if you
bring this business online you can
reasonably expect this much demand
because that is one of the scariest
things about buying a business is you
don't know
potentially yeah your total addressable
Market or your total upside what's the
ceiling on this yeah and like now that
I'm thinking about like I know why it
wouldn't apply to most businesses if I
wanty want to buy an HVAC company and I
want to test the demand in a certain
Market I could easily test the demand in
that market and maybe it wouldn't be
programmatic SEO maybe it'd be I don't
know throwing something up on a Facebook
group about needing services or I'm just
trying to think through it but I think
especially for private equity and
especially for Searchers a service that
would be
affordable to show this is what demand
and upside looks like for your
opportunity in this business would be
like I would have paid for that for sure

[18:00]
like I would have paid for that for sure
I would have paid for that because
you're you're not only giving me an idea
of what the demand is you are also the
solution on the back end because like
you just generated all those leads right
it's like yeah when I buy the business
of course I'm going to use Chris's
company because they already generated
the leads and like I know that I have
business there to go and
close tell me what you think I like it I
like this more than what we talked about
a month or two ago where we talked about
like validating a location remember that
as a service and we about ah It's tricky
because a major like someone like
Wendy's they do it in house but a one
loation restaurant you know you got to
find a guy that wants to grow it's hard
to find the right customer I like this
because it's even more Niche than that
which thinks which makes it even more
valuable I think you could go through
the Brokers like the the really really
good business brokers and call it like
Tam validation total addressable Market
validation as a service because no
Searcher no business buyer
is going into a business thinking like

[19:01]
is going into a business thinking like
okay this makes 100 Grand a year a 3X
multiple I'm going to make my money back
in three years that sounds good I don't
need to grow like they all are craving
to grow they want to grow that's the
whole strategy but how do they know how
much they can grow well and on top of
that a huge part of the buying process
is underwriting and a part of the
underwriting process is the bank looking
at the deal but there's this thing
called the qov quality of earnings so
they do their own quality of earnings
and they do an assessment and they say
like how healthy is this company but
other than that they also look at the
purchaser like does this person have the
experience can they run it can they grow
it if you added this into the packet
into your business plan and you were
like hey this is my experience I have
the cash you've seen the QE and I've
already done market research I've
already generated this many leads this
is how I validated the potential upside
it only makes your case stronger I don't
think it's necessarily going to be like
the differentiator but it just it makes
your case stronger for the bank to under
yeah yeah I got to work on the acronym

[20:02]
yeah yeah I got to work on the acronym
because it doesn't roll off the tongue
but I'm thinking like a quag quality of
growth potential okay it's got some work
to do I mean we're doing this in real
time here Nick growth opportunity upside
potential a guap gu I don't know guo guo
gu see Scott
guo yeah the the hardest part about any
New Concept is that it's a New Concept
and a lot of these sound great on paper
but will people pay three five 10 grand
for something like this this is probably
honestly this is probably more of a lead
magnet for a lead gen agency that is
trying to get new customers because
Searchers in particular they want to
grow their business postacquisition and
so if you're able to show them hey I can
generate leads but you're also providing
the service of like hey I'll show you
what the demand is then it's going to
help their case obviously but then
they're also bought into you as the lead
lead gen agency post close they're like

[21:00]
lead gen agency post close they're like
okay well of yeah I'm going to use Chris
because they showed me so maybe that's a
lead a lead gen you could be like a
growth marketing agency specifically
tailored for Searchers that just closed
and use this as your foot in the door
exactly it could even be a low ticket
foot in the door like
$500 to validate how much growth
potential there is in this business and
then $55,000 a month to help grow the
business after you actually kind of
Genius because they pay you a onetime
$500 you go and do the research you as
vendor may do it and be like oh this
industry kind of sucks or like this was
really hard to validate because I can't
get the phone numbers or I can't get in
Facebook groups or I can't get my
paperclip optimized whatever and so both
of you are like no no no thanks right
but if it does work out you've done the
research and you also know the best
channels to go through so it's like
you're getting paid to do the research
to validate it and then you also have an
idea of

[22:00]
idea of
implementation like you're the only guy
that knows how to implement it at Point
interesting I like that a
lot I like how we bring up all these
ideas and every single time we're like
yeah this is a good one this is a good
one but this one's good we're the guys
that sniff our own farts and be like oh
yeah that's yeah that's quity that
really doesn't stink like it really
doesn't stink it doesn't Miss
Jackson
sorry oh wow wow yeah all right I like
it so just to recap the idea to be an
agency for print shops or blue collar
businesses that need an interactive
website they're wasting money and time
providing quotes or speciically for
pricing quotes yep yep pricing quotes
and then you've got the the idea to be
like a lead magnet for Searchers that we
just talked about or the programmatic
idea to sell leads right print shop
leads that's like three ideas in one
you're welcome
go dang we freaking spitting gold

[23:00]
go dang we freaking spitting gold
today we are really cool our wives must
not present us behind our backs not my
wife you want me to go next or what you
want what do you got yeah yeah With Your
Best
Shot fire
away so my experience is in the
healthcare space love Healthcare it's
also an incredibly difficult space to
operate in but one of the
things about Healthcare that I think is
very difficult for individual
providers is having leverage when it
comes to negotiations
so there are a ton of providers that
actually provide services to patients
many of those might be a dentist who
owns a clinic or a physical therapist
who owns a clinic or a family practice
physician who has a practice that he
owns right they're not necessarily
affiliated with any hospital system or
any health system or any insurance
company they're just a standalone
independent provider the hard part about

[24:00]
independent provider the hard part about
being those Standalone independent
providers is that they have to get
contracts with all of the insurance
companies so you know just think about
who you're insured through I'm not you
because I know how yours works but you
know United Health Etna Blue Cross Blue
Shield all those companies they're the
ones that you pay your premium to and
then when you go and see the doctor they
pay the doctor for the services that
they rendered and for the most part
those individual providers are at the
mercy of the insurance companies
whatever the insurance company says
they're going to pay them that's just
what they're going to pay them and if
the physician doesn't want to take those
type of patients because they can't make
any money on them then most likely the
insurance company has another provider
that they can send them to because
they've got so much negotiating power
that they've somehow whatever built out
their network of individuals so it's
hard for these individual providers to
go and negotiate with larger payers so I
was thinking this week because I was
talking to an individual provider

[25:01]
talking to an individual provider
they're having a hard time they're
trying to negotiate something right now
and there's other providers that are
doing the same thing but they're all
doing it separately and the insurance
company's not budging and individual
providers are like dropping off one by
one and I asked them I'm like why don't
you like get together and have like a
collective bargaining you know agreement
that you negotiate with the insurance
provider and they're like yeah I don't
know why we've never done something like
that so I think it would be really
interesting specifically in the health
space and I I don't know if this is
feasible but like conceptually it sounds
like it makes sense for somebody who
knows Healthcare like somebody like me
to Target A specific group of providers
maybe it's psychiatrists maybe it's
family practice maybe it's physical
therapists dentists whatever it is and
get a group of them together maybe you
build a local group like not a Facebook
group but like a local Boise dentist
group or a local Boise Physical Therapy
Group and then you organize them into a
group that has bargaining power with
these insurance providers but in order
for them to organize they've got to pay

[26:01]
for them to organize they've got to pay
obviously a membership fee to you to be
the host to organize those things and
you have monthly meetups and you send
out information and maybe you help them
with continuing education and webinars
and those types of things but I really
like the healthcare space I think it's
growing like crazy I don't ever want to
be a provider again but I think there
are tons of opportunities like this to
service providers in the healthcare
space and this would be one way to help
them negotiate their rates but also be a
good service to them m
what do you think I like it yeah
so I don't know anything about
Healthcare you know this I don't even
know what you did for the last 15 years
of your career true I still haven't
figured that out so I'm gonna I'm gonna
talk about what I can wrap my brain
around and I was wondering I was here
thinking as you're talking how do you
charge is it $50 a month is it $500 a
month per is it like kind of the model
where you charge a very very low amount
and you just try to get a bunch of
volume let's say you have a 500
different restaurants and you're going
to negotiate like agency services for

[27:00]
to negotiate like agency services for
their Facebook ads because they all want
to grow and you charge them all $100 a
month and you just kind of you're
charging that to put them together and
to reach out to the agency and negotiate
prices on their behalf you're going to
help me with the distribution let me
explain to you really quickly it has to
be Regional because many of these
contracts aren't National for healthare
it does right yeah for healthcare it has
to be Regional because what they pay a
provider in Boise is different than what
they pay a provider in Dallas what they
pay a provider in New York right there's
cost of living adjustment so I think
you'd have to have it in these like
specific Geographic areas for healthcare
yeah yeah just for healthare okay so I'm
wondering if the monetization strategy
is to take and I'm going to use
non-healthcare because I can wrap my
head around that is to take the savings
like let's say you found 50 Shopify
stores that all sell merch okay and
there are thousands of them it's like
apparel is like the biggest category on
Shopify so let's say your whole stick is
to gather shop ify stores together that
all sell apparel and you can negotiate

[28:01]
all sell apparel and you can negotiate
anything their clavio bill their agency
Bill anything and you basically go to an
agency like Brandon's one that's
reputable wellknown and say hey what
would you charge me and you can kind of
use this ethical bait and switch right
actually it's not even that you want to
know what their quote is before they
know what you can offer them you want to
get the honest answer from them right
yep so you get them on the phone and say
hey I've got an apparel store on Shopify
you know our ad spend is about X we
really want to Outsource our agency
services to you what would it cost three
grand a month okay cool what if I told
you I have 50 of those
businesses it's same all apparel all
merch all Shopify how much would that be
if it's three grand for one how much is
it for 50 okay well it's you know
carried across it'd be 150 Grand a month
maybe they say well gez economies of
scale we could use a lot of the same
creatives like it's going to be 50 Grand
a month because we'll do a lot of the
same stuff with a lot of them wow okay
it's like a 65% savings so then you go

[29:01]
it's like a 65% savings so then you go
to the 50 and you say hey here's what I
what I negotiated we're GNA save
66% my fee is going to be 30% of the
savings so what you are describing is a
g a group purchasing organization
they're freaking amazing and I don't
think enough people actually create them
and utilize them because there are a lot
of individual independent business
owners that they all make purchases to
clavio or Shopify or whatever whoever
they're using but they don't have
bargaining power because they're not
buying in the volume necessary to allow
them to negotiate but then there are
these groups these group Port gpos is
what they call them group purchasing
organizations that bring those people
together that are organized by an
individual that then goes and negotiates
purchasing pricing on their behalf the
the healthcare example I gave is a
little bit different because it's not
they're not negotiating purchasing power
they're negotiating Revenue where it's
like what are you going to pay us for
the services we're providing as opposed
to to what we are going to you know pay
for this and so I've seen it on the

[30:03]
for this and so I've seen it on the
expense side of things these gpos I
haven't necessarily seen it as much on
the revenue side of things because
typically revenues individually
negotiated in other settings but in
healthcare it's not it's kind of like
these are like the standard fees when it
comes to a revenue standpoint but I
freaking love that GP idea because I
have seen multiple companies do this you
remember the guys I worked with uh a
couple jobs ago I won't mention them
they started a
GP so they had a bunch of healthcare
operations in different states either
they started or they invested in one I
can't quite remember but they had
Healthcare operations in a bunch of
different states and so they took that
size and then they started going to
other healthcare providers in their
areas and said hey join us and let's get
together and negotiate a contract with
this supply company and you'll get this
lower rate but will keep X Dollar in
savings so I think organizing these gpos
just around pricing and then you don't
have to to worry about any other

[31:00]
have to to worry about any other
membership I guess support you don't
have to worry about conferences or like
continuing education or anything like
that especially if you know the space I
like that a lot you could either do it
industry specific or you could do it
like service specific like hey I have a
clavio GP if you guys want to join it
well yeah I think the problem with the
Shopify example that I gave is that a
lot of these 50 stores might not want or
need agency services and so you
negotiate that bulk pricing and then you
go to the 50 and only 12 of them are
like yeah okay I'll take that then you
have to go back and be like actually I
only have 12 oh well the the price is
different then right so maybe the and I
think I have seen like a couple VC
funded startups that are trying exactly
what we're talking about which doesn't
mean it's not an opportunity anymore in
fact it means it is an opportunity maybe
the play here is to do this with blue
collar mom and pop businesses that no
one is thinking about starting a GPO
with let's go back to the print shop
example right what do print shops buy
every month 100% of them Inc they're all
buying ink they're already doing that so

[32:01]
buying ink they're already doing that so
there's much less friction you gather a
hundred of them together and it's you
don't have to get on a sales call it's
just an email it's like hey do you want
to opt into this yes or no there's no
cost yes okay cool then you go to the
there's probably like three to five big
Inc manufacturers and say hey we have a
100 locations what's your book pricing
and then it's recurring and then they're
already spending money on what they're
already spending money on they just get
a discount and you just capture a
percentage of the discount maybe you
charge it to the manufacturer and so
they don't have to pay you anything I
mean they're paying for it just not
directly let's use that example ink
right you get 100% shops together you
negotiate the price of ink with the
manufacturer do you then have to you
know accept the orders and ship them or
does the manufacturer know that you're
just a middleman and they're shipping
directly to the individual shops you
need an agreement on visibility I don't
want to operationally have to fulfill
orders right like I no no I this isn't
that you just need the manufacturer to

[33:01]
that you just need the manufacturer to
agree to share the visibility with you
so you you don't have to take them at
their word God ites that make sense yep
yeah yeah so you know what to charge
them yeah so let's say if an average
print shops spends 10 grand a month on
Inc they could start spending eight
grand a month and 500 of that goes to
you directly from the manufacturer is
there a way you could do it where you
build a website and they purchase
through you quote unquote
but then the manufacturer just ships to
them because then that way you can
charge them you don't have to keep
anyone honest right you're in control
the hard part with that is there's
probably a zillion different
SKS and you'd have to like replicate
that on your own website so maybe it's
better if you did it in an industry
that's more simple with like less moving
Parts maybe you start with like the
honesty system of like the manufacturer
sharing with you and then if it grows to
scale you invest in building the website
so you don't have to follow up with the

[34:01]
so you don't have to follow up with the
purchase orders MH I like that it's way
to get into it that's the way you get
into it yeah yeah
okay so same guy with the print shop
okay the other thing he's doing that's
really interesting he is inventing a
product and he's very excited about this
and I'm excited about it because I think
it's a great idea I'm not going to say
exactly what it is to protect his idea
but let's just say it's an idea in the
RV industry that makes life a lot more
convenient and it's one of those ideas
that is so obvious like it's just he
tells it to me and I'm like okay that's
already being done surely and then it's
not it's not being done it's like don't
go ever go in an RV it's like
duh you know like why would anyone ever
want to ride in an RV around the country
you know what I mean that's offensive
and I'm gonna gloss right over
it Muhammad edit that up what was the
most validating thing about this idea
for me was the fact that the dealership
he bought his r v from he told them the
idea and their minds were like blown and

[35:02]
idea and their minds were like blown and
every time he goes back there the sales
guys are like dude what are you gonna
make that idea like we want to sell it
like we have so many people that would
buy this from you like please like
please make it well you can use our
email list like they're they're wanting
to help him because there's so much
demand for this little widget that
solves a very specific problem yet no
one at the dealership or any dealership
had thought to execute on it or develop
it and it's not something you need to
like start a manufacturing facility for
you just need to take a few moving parts
and like assemble them by hand like you
don't need all this expensive equipment
and it just blew my mind that there are
so many ideas left out there not just a
service but like an actual physical
product that are seemingly right there
out in the open for anyone and like I'm
confident he's going to make a lot of
money with this idea he needs the
distribution but that's it it's crazy to
me how many good ideas left there are
out there in the world do we need to
like think through at some point we will
the formula of like idea validation but

[36:03]
the formula of like idea validation but
also coupling with
distribution right it's like I think
everybody who's listening to this knows
somebody or could figure out some way if
they thought long enough about a
distribution Channel maybe they know
someone who works at a dealership or
maybe they know somebody who has an
e-commerce store like there's something
that they have access to that somebody
else doesn't have access to that would
allow for distribution but figuring out
what to sell through that distribution
channel is hard right like you have to
do a lot of brainstorming I think it
would be fun to think about what the
framework would be to help people
identify okay idea distribution how do
you pair them which one comes first is
it idea or is it distribution it could
be distribution first and then idea or
it could be you know vice versa so
because that's essentially what we're
doing on with each one of these these
brainstorms is idea distribution idea
distribution it's interesting you say
that because I would have said the exact
opposite that most people have an idea

[37:00]
opposite that most people have an idea
with no no even clue of how to
distribute it or sell it right you think
it's the
opposite I don't no no I think that most
people have an idea first what I'm
saying is like if they really racked
their brain they could think of a way to
distribute it that or for most people
who want to get into entrepreneurship I
think they want to be 99% of people who
become entrepreneurs are just like I
want to do a business I I don't really
care what it is these things kind of
interest me more than other things I'll
fall into this space there's the one% of
people who are like nope I only want to
do this product and sell it to these
type of people like they're very Mission
driven I think that's maybe 1% too small
but it's a smaller percentage of of most
entrepreneurs and so if you fall into
the category of people who are like I'm
kind of idea agnostic I'm not
necessarily passionate about any one
thing in particular then I think there
is a there can be a very proven
framework for finding your idea and if I
were in that position I would start with

[38:00]
were in that position I would start with
distribution and then work my way back
to what the idea would
be as opposed to the idea and then work
my way up to distribution and we're
talking about starting a business like
buying a business is different if you're
starting a business and you're like just
trying to test something I'd start with
distribution and then work my way back
to what the product is
yeah I still think there's something
there we talked about this a month or
two ago of getting a community of like
white collar employees together somehow
and just having them brainstorm on ideas
that they're seeing in their jobs that
could be peeled off right as a
standalone business that's an amazing
idea maybe it's not a business but it's
like organize a lunch once a week and
invite certain people in your community
to come and join and discuss their
problems like what are they facing it's
similar I posted a tweet about Nick Gray
recently he was on my first million and

[39:00]
recently he was on my first million and
he's the dude who organizes these
parties essentially and like his idea is
if you become known as the guy who's
organizing events you become sought
after and you become interesting you may
not be interesting in in your own right
but if you're the guy who's organizing
stuff you become interesting and so I
think there's opportunity to just
organize these events become interesting
and then hear those ideas and start kind
of playing around with it that's a
really cool idea I like that well it
makes me think I've got a friend named
Carlos and he work works for I went to
TCU with him for for my NBA and he works
for one of the big four not accounting
firms but airline seat manufacturers
okay that's right yeah yeah yeah yeah I
remember you that and he I love Carlos
he's kind of entrepreneurial but he's so
late in his career even he would admit
he's never really gonna start a business
right he's never gonna quit his job to
start a business right but I love guys
like these because they always come to
me with their ideas like Chris do this
just give me 1% so one idea he had
that only someone like Carlos would know

[40:00]
that only someone like Carlos would know
and I still love this idea and it's so
simple they make Airline seats and he
said that the cable that attaches to
like the main electrical infrastructure
in the seat and the seat back heads up
display a lot of these heads up displays
like they pull out or they rotate right
and so the cable that connects them
frequently breaks and it's literally an
electrical cable a plug I want you to
guess how much this company has to pay
for the replacements for just a cord
just a cord I don't know five bucks per
unit $6,000 shut your mouth that's sh
I'm not exaggerating I'm not
exaggerating stupid promise ,000 I swear
on my life are these to text me and I'll
send you the screenshot are they
imported from the Future made by
children of like there's one seller to
sell anything to an airline you have to
be like FAA registered which is a lot of
red tape which makes sense you don't
want to f
but a lot of these like super Niche

[41:00]
but a lot of these like super Niche
manufacturers or suppliers or vendors
have a monopoly on a little widget
because they're the only ones thinking
of doing it and so they charge whatever
they want and the seat manufacturer
doesn't care at all because they're just
passing it on with a 50% markup to
Boeing or to Lanza or whoever wait wait
wait wait wait wait
wait $6,000 and then they're marking it
up 50% so they're passing I don't know
about 50% but they Mark everything up
they mark it all up if I was in the
airline why wouldn't I be like let's
just bring this in house I guess maybe
the opportunity cost is so low that's
nuts to me we talked about this a ton
where he's like dude you got to do this
like you got to go find a manufacturer
in China get a FAA registered and I
looked into it like I went down that
rabbit hole for a while and then you
know I abandoned it but that's not even
the idea right that's an idea in and of
itself but the idea is to find the
Carlos's of the world that have all that
see these insights that no one else
would ever see because they're so

[42:00]
would ever see because they're so
internal and to share them somehow maybe
it's a a like a marketpl you've got a
community over here of Carlos's that are
sharing ideas and then you got a
community over here that are paying a
lot of money to get these ideas that are
not googleable like there's a whole
framework around that around building a
business that like answers questions
that can't be Googled kind of like
Hampton right Hampton interviews these
high Networth people it's kind of like
uh CLG you heard of CLG mhm yeah like
they're this company that essentially if
there's private Equity Funds that like
they want to do research in an industry
they will go and find someone in that
industry they'll pay them a lot of money
and they'll get like
firstand knowledge of what's going on
it's kind of like CLG except you're not
necessarily validating an idea or
getting advice on whether or not you
should invest in something you're just
trying to pick their brain like what are
your problems right now that's really
interesting because it's like yeah you
can go start and I'm not trying to crap
on ideas that even we've talked about
you can go start an agency you can go
start whatever business but I think a

[43:02]
start whatever business but I think a
lot of people want like the inside scoop
like the idea that no one else knows
about H and I think they'd pay a premium
for that of course they would yeah
that's what anybody wants because you
want to feel like you have a competitive
Advantage otherwise you're just
competing against everybody else's
creativity on what might be an issue in
an industry that they've never operated
in yeah and there's this selection bias
going on where the guys like Carlos's
they probably make 250 to 750 a year
they're doing great they've got stock
options they see that you know they're
going to retire at 55 and even if their
job is soul sucking they're not about to
quit but the people at those levels in a
business are the ones that see the best
ideas so it's like the same people that
would never start the ideas are the ones
seeing the best
ideas that is so true there's a
disconnect right
yeah that's pretty there all right let's
cut it
all right this is great while we're
heading love you oh okay I like you too

[44:04]
heading love you oh okay I like you too
okay what you think I texted my friend
Carlos and I got a screenshot from him
so I'm going to Tweet it and you'll see
it and go subscribe to my newsletter
