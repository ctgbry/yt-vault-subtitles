did I just discover the best business
model on the planet that anyone can copy
here's exactly what it is how it works
and how you can copy it shamelessly so
there's this website here that sells one
by one plots of land in Scotland for $40
that seems cheap right not cheap if you
were to buy an acre of land in Scotland
guess how much a 1x one square foot of
land would cost you about 3 cents and
they're selling it for $40 and it's just
a gag gift it's not even legal they give
you this hokey little certificate so you
can call yourself a lord it's a gag gift
and they make $6 million a year most of
it profit so then I found a copycat
business that's even more genius they're
called Texan titles and they did the
exact same thing in Texas but here's the
thing land in Texas is stupid cheap like
$500 an acre cheap so what this guy
Brandon did was buy 20 acres in middle
of nowhere Texas for $10,000 and sold it
for $40 for one square foot his cost 1.2
that is literally a
99.99% profit margin he doesn't have to
ship anything it's all automated and he
is printing money especially around the
holidays cuz people buy this as gag
gifts forch Tans or people that want to

gifts forch Tans or people that want to
be Texans so how do you copy this
literally do this in any state you want
in any country you want it's like the
buy a star idea that's a $20 million
business get my full business plan for
this right here
