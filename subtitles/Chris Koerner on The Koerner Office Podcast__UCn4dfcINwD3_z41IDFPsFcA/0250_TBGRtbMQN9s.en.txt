I have an addiction, a problem, and a
business idea. Addiction. I have too
many business ideas. That's why I post
all these videos about them. And I have
to start a business right after I think
about it. Two problem. My yard looks
like crap. It's absolutely terrible.
Look at my yard. It's embarrassing. I'm
embarrassed. And so last night, I was
thinking, how can I fix this? Oh, I'm
just going to take a bunch of pictures
of my yard up close, upload it to
ChatGpt, tell it where I live, and say,
"Hey, give me a 12-month timeline and
prescription of what to buy and what to
do to fix my yard." Then I thought, huh,
that could be a cool AI tool that I
could build that anyone could use. And
then it could be free, but you could
include affiliate links with all the
products that you tell them to buy. And
the users could generate their own
articles with these prescriptions that
you could post automatically to Web Flow
via OpenAI's API and Zapier. Then I
thought, instead of building this, why
don't I just hop on YouTube live and
build it and then anyone can ask
questions about how to do it in the
comments. So, I'm going to do that.
