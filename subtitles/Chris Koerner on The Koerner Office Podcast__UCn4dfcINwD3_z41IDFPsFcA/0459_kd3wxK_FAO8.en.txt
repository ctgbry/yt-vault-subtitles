[00:00]
welcome to the ker office I am sitting
here in San Francisco it's 10:51 p.m. my
family's sleeping up in the hotel room
and I've got to get a podcast out but
it's okay because I've been thinking
about this one for hours and I'm really
excited about it if you're watching this
on YouTube the quality sucks because I'm
using my MacBook webcam if you're
listening on audio the audio sucks
because I'm using a $15 Bluetooth mic so
just bear with me this won't be a very
long episode I'm going to do my 2024
year in review and I'm going to break
down my net worth what it's comprised of
why what investments I made in myself in
others and anything and what I'm looking
forward to about next year this is stuff
I don't talk about that often so I
thought you might find it interesting
and we'll see how this
[Music]
goes 2024 was an incredibly
transformative year if you listen to the
hold cob Bros that's coming out I think
in just a couple days you'll hear just a
little bit of overlap that's Nick and I
talking about our year together and this

[01:00]
talking about our year together and this
is more talking about what my year
looked like as an entrepreneur as a dad
as an investor but there shouldn't be
that much overlap so 2024 started off
with a bang we launched our tree Biz
boot camp we hosted about 20 people half
virtual half
iners in Dallas we spent about 60 hours
together give or take we ate meals
together we basically rented out a
conference room in a Wei work and we
talked about home services and it was a
lot of fun and a couple of those guys
started tree businesses based on that
boot camp which is awesome it was super
stressful to put that on in person it
was a lot of work we didn't make that
much money from it but it was also
awesome at the same time and I may do
something again like that in the future
that was January then February I
launched this podcast about 11 months
ago and YouTube channel and Instagram
and Tik Tok and all that and it started
off kind of slow and I I remember in
those First episodes if you heard me I
said this is going to be a 10 episode
test and it's going to be the Dave
Ramsey for entrepreneurs and we're going
to see where this goes and I really
enjoyed it I enjoyed doing it and the

[02:01]
enjoyed it I enjoyed doing it and the
Q&A went through a few different
iterations we did live streaming we did
me just reading off questions and then I
took a break from it for six months and
then a month ago I started it again with
just pre-recorded uh audio questions so
that way you can actually hear the
caller and you you know all this you
know all this so I'm super glad I did
this podcast started out with two
episodes a week and then I thought man
there's a lot I want to get out there to
the world let's just go ahead and do
three episodes a week and
that's why I'm recording this at 10:55
p.m. in San Francisco while I head up
the West Coast on an AM Amtrak sleeper
train with my my wife and Fort kids
because I don't want to miss I don't
want to miss a day even though you guys
would just go on with your life I just
don't want to do it I want to stay
consistent so this podcast has been
transformative and I'm having a lot of
fun all right and then in January I also
partnered with the guys at Blue metric
that's my RV park stuff I met Jeff and
John in December and they had acquired

[03:03]
John in December and they had acquired
about eight RV parks over the the
previous 12 months and they knew that I
had experience in the space they saw me
on Twitter and they said hey let's do a
deal together uh so I flew down to
Louisiana I filmed some content I did
some due diligence on both this deal and
on John and Jeff and blue metric and the
deal went great and I raised some money
from a couple tweets and then we've done
like eight more deals since then so now
today blue metric owns about 26 Parks
I'm in almost half of them maybe 10 or
so give or take and I've been able to
raise about $4 million almost
exclusively from Twitter without pushing
it that much you know I've probably
tweeted about investment opportunities
once per month on average but that has
been an awesome experience I couldn't
have partnered with better guys our
deals are going great we have $50

[04:00]
deals are going great we have $50
million worth of parks now and we're
actually hoping to slow down a little
next year believe it or not because
operations are hard and it's gotten a
little hairy but this endeavor with blue
metric has really boosted my net worth
for the year so let's let's talk about
that for a minute I'm not going to tell
you what my net worth is because I don't
want to but I will talk percentages and
break down what I invest in and why I
invest in it so when it comes to stocks
I only have about 1 and a half% of my
net worth in stocks and I'm the type of
guy where I feel much much more pain if
I sell a winning stock too early than if
I lose money on a stock and the same is
said with any investment and so I'll
never forget March 2020 I was sitting in
a hotel room I just ran 114 mile race
which was a 3/4 mile lap around an
orange cone in the middle of nowhere
just north of Houston it was called
Jackalope jam and I did the 24-hour

[05:00]
Jackalope jam and I did the 24-hour
event so you just run 3/4 of a mile back
and forth back and forth back and forth
for 24 hours straight and whoever runs
the most in 24 hours wins and I actually
won which was awesome and I set the
course record at the time which was
about 114 miles and this was right when
Co was just going nuts and I went back
it might have been late February I think
it was February and stocks just started
crashing it was ugly and I was probably
a little delirious from you know running
for 24 hours straight and I was sick and
my family was sick and we were in this
hotel room eating Papa John's and I
opened my Robin Hood app and everything
was tanking I bought Tesla early I
bought Nvidia early Shopify Facebook all
the winners I was up big on all of them
and they just started tanking and no one
knew what was going to happen and I was
just scared and I was like okay I'm
selling I sold everything which is the
dumbest thing I don't do that anymore
and even though my Tesla was up like 3x
it's 7x again after after that so I

[06:00]
it's 7x again after after that so I
would have been up 21x on Tesla Nvidia
let's not even talk about it I refused
to even check Shopify same that's
painful for me and I did that not quite
as badly with Bitcoin I first bought
Bitcoin in 2016 I doubled my money I
sold most of it some of it because I
didn't know anything about it I didn't
really believe in it I just wanted to
make money and then I really learned
about it once I learned about it I was
like Chris you idiot why did you sell
that I felt like a genius too I doubled
my money in like a few months this was
2016 right before the bull market that
go around got really hot and so then I
bought back in and I was like okay Chris
you're never doing that again you're
never selling your Bitcoin because I
just I hate selling too early and so I
went pretty hard on bitcoin and ethereum
and Litecoin in
2016 and I lost some of it just due to
stupid mistakes or trading it for icos
or dumb projects but the vast majority
of it I still have and so that's my
that's my investing claim to fame $680

[07:00]
that's my investing claim to fame $680
was when I first bought Bitcoin and
eight years later that seems like a
genius move but at the time it felt like
an idiot move because you know Bitcoin
had been $6 and then 60 and so or $60 so
paying $680 for a digital token that no
one knew anything about felt idiotic but
I am never selling it especially now
that you can earn interest on it you can
borrow against it I'm not selling my
Bitcoin you'll have to pry it from my
cold dead hands same with ethereum my
portfolio
is basically call it 50% Bitcoin 40%
ethereum 10% stupid Moon shop bets and I
also own a mutant ape nft if you know
what those are I paid I paid 60 grand
for it it's worth seven or eight grand
maybe 10 right now so but I'm not
selling that either because whatever
that's I'd rather just I'd rather go to
zero than sell it too early anyway so
I'm am heavily weighted in crypto it is
about 15% of My overall net worth which

[08:00]
about 15% of My overall net worth which
would give some people anxiety but
honestly it used to be closer to 80% but
I made a couple dumb decisions with it I
borrowed against it four or five years
ago to buy more and I got margin called
on some of it not all of it but some of
it so that was one of the dumb decisions
that I just referenced and then some
icos that didn't go my way but most of
it I still have the original crypto that
I bought in 2016 and I've bought along
the way as well and I'll never sell it
anyway back to stocks I'm off on a
couple tangents here the stocks I buy
now or the stocks I've purchased since
2020 I am not selling I will never sell
I've changed my philosophy and I know
everyone knows that that you shouldn't
day trade and you should just buy the
index fund but I'm not going to buy the
index fund because I have a higher risk
tolerance and I know that I'm not going
to sell it I haven't made that mistake
in almost five years now I won't make it
again and so if I buy a stock I plan to
die with that stock now if something
drastic happened and I had to sell it to
pay my mortgage I would sell it along
with my crypto of course my family's

[09:00]
with my crypto of course my family's
well-being comes first but so today my
stocks are only about 1 and a half% of
my portfolio my crypto is about 10 times
that 15% of my portfolio and I own my
biggest Holdings are coinbase and Tesla
by far and I keep buying Tesla and I
keep buying coinbase and thankfully my
two biggest Holdings are also my best
performing Holdings which works out
nicely I also own Zoom Pon Facebook
Chipotle and my portfolio is up a good
bit I've definitely beat the market by
quite a bit but I buy stocks very very
rarely and very impulsively to be honest
I don't do any research I see something
dipping that I believe in and I buy more
that's it so not investment advice none
of this is investment advice which
Probably sounds obvious because you're
probably shaking your head and think I'm
an idiot right now but that's okay I
don't care okay so we're up to 165% of
my my net worth well we got to talk

[10:01]
my my net worth well we got to talk
about real estate I am including my
personal home in my net worth because
it's a significant number and I'm of the
camp that it is part of your net worth
so my personal home I have a very decent
chunk of equity in my home we built it
in 2016 we've refinanced it once we
pulled out six figures it just continues
to appreciate we live in a good area
great School District very Supply
constrained very close to Dallas very
family friendly in fact it's family
friendly but the the families are
getting being priced out one of our
elementary schools just closed down
because young families can't really
afford to live her anymore so we're
bullish on the area I I never want to
sell this house either it's a very
unique property and I plan to one day
turn my home probably maybe into a
wedding venue I've referenced this a
couple times before but two three years
ago now we were forced to move to
Houston as a family so my daughter could
get a double lung transplant and we put
our home on Airbnb and a lot of people
use it as a wedding venue like as a
smaller wedding venue and so we learned

[11:01]
smaller wedding venue and so we learned
that there's demand for that so that's
kind of a a blessing in disguise we'd
have to get it rezoned we'd obviously
have to move out it would need to be a
commercial property but I think the city
would be up for it and I bought the land
behind me it's a 1 acre lot with a 2100
square foot shop that I rent out to a
landscaping crew and it is zoned
residential and we plan to build another
home on that so I own that land outright
there's no loan on that so between those
two properties back to back I've got
seven figures of of equity there and
then we've got RV parks at the beginning
of this year
2024 I owned about half of a small RV
park because me and my older business
partners sold our entire portfolio
across 2021 and 2022 so I had zero parks
there for a while we bought one last
last year in Waco where're it's on the

[12:01]
last year in Waco where're it's on the
market to sell right now we close in
about a month if all goes well that's
the only one I owned a year ago I owned
half of it with Nick and then I started
with blue metric and we've purchased
about 10 marks together and that is a
sizable portion of my net worth which is
about another seven figures so I'm
pretty heavily weighted in real estate
and then outside of that I've been an
angel investor in some small Tech deals
that have been fun that's less than 1%
of my net worth if you include some odds
and ends that's one to two% of my net
worth and then the companies that I own
that's kind of weird I'm always overly
overly conservative when assigning
valuations to my own companies because
I've had a lot of equity that looked
really big on paper that ended up going
to zero or or or being a lot smaller
than I thought so the rest of my net
worth is in my own companies and I would

[13:00]
worth is in my own companies and I would
say my net worth grew and I'm kind of if
it sounds like I'm kind of being
wishy-washy and guessing it's because I
am kind of guessing like a lot of people
track this maniacally with spreadsheets
I have one spreadsheet that I only look
at maybe once every couple years and I
have it pulled up right now this doesn't
take up a lot of brain space for me my
net worth it just doesn't I like
building businesses and talking about it
but my net worth definitely grew by
double digits this year call it 30 or
40% I'm not much of a goal Setter I
wanted to be a millionaire by 30 I check
that box and I've got kind of loose
goals rough goals but it's nothing I
really adhere to I prefer to set goals
around being consistent with things kind
of like this podcast my health and
fitness goal for 2025 is to log every
calorie I eat that's it not to never eat
sugar never have caffeine or like I just
want to be accountable to every calorie
I eat because if I eat too much I'm
going to know it ignorance can be Bliss
ignorance can also be bad so I love just
setting my goals around things that I
can control right I can't control my net

[14:01]
can control right I can't control my net
worth I have some aspect of control over
some of it but no but I can control how
many businesses I start how many videos
or newsletters I publish how many dates
I go on with my wife Andor kids 2024 was
an amazing incredible year and I think
I'm going to look back on it as a
pivotal moment in my life for instance
last month the month of November 77
million people saw my content in some
form or fashion I gained two 270,000
followers in the month of November alone
I'm adding 8 to 10,000 new followers
combined across platforms every single
day um so by the end of next year I
should have four to five million uh
followers and I don't know what I want
to do with all that yet I don't know I
genuinely don't I don't have this
Grandmaster plan like Alex horos talks
about you know he wants to become a
billionaire and do it all in public I
don't I just think it's fun and it's
good to have and honestly between me and
you and the fence post there's probably
going to be a day here within the next

[15:00]
going to be a day here within the next
few years where I just clock out you
know we used to talk about exiting the
rat race as in starting a business or
not relying on on N9 to5 but I look at
that as staying offline being offline
that is the downside to all this I'm
always online you know and I saw this
meme the other day if you remember those
computer desks those workstations we had
as teenagers if you're a millennial you
know wooden it had a slots for all your
CDs and your your Gateway desktop there
on the bottom right and your big monitor
that went back 2 feet like that was the
internet it was confined to a corner of
our home and I really really miss that I
love that I want to get back to that and
I think large portions of society will
do the same I don't want the internet in
my pocket anymore or on my wrist I don't
want to hold myself to anything but by
the time I turned 40 I would have really
liked to be on the internet about 80%
less and I don't know what that looks
like as a content creator but that is a
goal that is the downside to this
content stuff you got to be online and

[16:01]
content stuff you got to be online and
you just get flooded with comments and
ignorance and agulation and flattery and
hate and everything in between it's just
a lot and I kind of love it and I kind
of hate it all at the same time but I
went from about 60,000 to 1.2 million
followers in 2024 my content was viewed
over half a billion times which is just
crazy I'm also considering in a couple
years just pivoting from business to
church stuff honestly just having a
church like a nonprofit podcast I
wouldn't be able to bring my audience
over obviously this is a business
audience but I think I would enjoy that
as well and it would do good to the
world as well but if I can use this
content to help people start businesses
if people can email me and say I started
this business because of what you said
because of an idea that I got from you
this one sentence that you said if
that's you please email me Chrisco
founders.com I want to know who you are
that just it brings me lot of Joy I will

[17:00]
that just it brings me lot of Joy I will
be monetizing this stuff in some way I
started it a little bit here a month or
so ago and I'll be doing more of that I
have to obviously I I can't do all this
for free but it's just not a priority
for me there's so many ways to make
money content is just one of many as
you'll hear on my hold co-pro episode I
think short form video is one of the
biggest asymmetric bets of our time to
think you can just hit record for a few
minutes edit hit publish and millions
that people can see it it's incredible
and no I didn't get that way because I
had 50,000 Twitter followers and I
carried them all over to Instagram I
started from scratch and I published 40
or 50 videos that almost nobody saw
until I found my groove so very bullish
on short form video specifically to be
used as a vehicle to get people into
your orbit and then funneling them to
long form video or audio or text right
because there's a lot of Tik Tok
creators out there that really don't
have anything interesting to say after
second 61 on their video right you've

[18:02]
second 61 on their video right you've
got to be able to go deeper on this
content which is why it's perfect for me
so I can put out a 30 second business
idea they'll find my podcast or YouTube
or newsletter and then they'll read my
2,000-word newsletter or watch my
hourong podcast and hopefully think oh
wow this guy isn't just ideas he has
execution ideas as well so it's really
just worked out great if you're not on
my newsletter TKO pod.com you could
subscribe other things we did this year
side vending a short form video that
turned into a business selling freaking
perfume vending machines of all things I
just have no idea where 2025 is going to
take me but I'm having a lot of fun very
very grateful to all of you thank you
for your five-star reviews for your kind
words kind words stand out a lot more
than the mean ones even if there might
be more mean ones than I don't even know
but I'm grateful for you all and we'll
see you around
