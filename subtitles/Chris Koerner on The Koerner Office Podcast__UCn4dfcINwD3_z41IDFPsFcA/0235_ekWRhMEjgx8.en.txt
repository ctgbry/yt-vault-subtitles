and stuff are in the middle to the back
half let me know what you think we'll
have Brandon on again and uh
[Music]
enjoy I've got Brandon here Brandon is a
friend never met him in person but we
will one day and the owner of Wallaroo
uh media right did I say that right yes
yeah Wallaroo media how are you doing
happy to be here good good good thank
you and you're currently traveling
Europe with your family and you're in
Tuscany so that is true yeah here in
Europe for six months having a little
sabatical it's very fun all right so why
don't you just tell us who you are and
how you got to owning a a media agency
yeah so I'm Brandon like you said I
started waloo media on the side in 2008
kind of I didn't have the name yet but
that's when I started learning it the
reason why why was because my parents

[02:01]
reason why why was because my parents
had a website built that it was their
first foray into digital they didn't
have a website previously they spent all
their money on it it was a website to
allow people to customize their
letterman jacket if they're a high
school athlete that's what it was first
of its kind it was actually pretty
awesome and
revolutionary I'll say that word of a
website at the time because it was like
the first where you actually could
customize a piece of clothing and see
all the changes while you're doing it
and stuff and then order it right there
so anyway after they had it built they
didn't have any visitors going to the
site right because it was new so they
asked me to go out and get bids for
marketing and the cheapest one I got was
six grand a month for SEO only which was
really expensive especially this is 2008
we're talking but yeah and they didn't
have any money they had zero dollars a
month so I said well what if I learn it
and maybe you share the profits with me
or whatever I was still majoring in
finance at BYU and they said sure So I
started diving into Reddit and M and

[03:01]
started diving into Reddit and M and
stuff like that and learning and I
started really enjoying it and loving it
and putting into practice everything I
was learning and the results were really
good less than a year later they were on
the top half of page one for almost 300
different keywords so wow it was going
really really well and then I started
getting referrals and just kind of grew
it from there so were you focusing on
SEO just like organic SEO yeah initially
for them it was SEO and then Google PPC
okay and what kind of tactics were you
using then that would not apply today or
is a lot of it just the
same oh no there was so much stuff that
wouldn't work anymore I would register
you know those were the days of like
stumble upon if you remember stumble
upon was big so if you got a site if you
registered it or whatever on stumble
upon and then if you came across it and
click through then that would like
basically help it in the stumble upon Al
Alm so I would do that or I would

[04:03]
Alm so I would do that or I would
register for profiles that was a big
thing think Yelp but versions that no
one ever used there were like 200 of
those so the bio link was a followed
link so it was like not that hard to get
200 pretty solid domain Authority links
that pretty quick yeah yeah back links
they didn't have good anchor text but
anyway they were still from good domain
so that was another thing even doing
like comments on other blogs with the
customized anchor text so it would say
like custom letterman jacket and then
the link would be to the site they
weren't black hat this is all like white
hat stuff but yeah none of that works
anymore not at all was there ever
something that you did that was just
totally offthe wall that really wouldn't
work like I remember hearing stories of
people in SEO back in the day where they
would just put thousands of keywords
right on the homepage in white font with

[05:01]
right on the homepage in white font with
a white background you can did you ever
hear that yeah oh yeah that was even I
guess I would classify that as gry hat
that was even gry hat at the time I
didn't really do that but I did spin up
a bunch of landing pages so whether it
be for like a specific school or a city
that was easy to do you know now you can
do it way faster with AI but that was
easy to do and duplicate content wasn't
really that much of an issue so you
could spin up 50 100 landing pages
that are all pretty similar just
different city names or whatever and
they would rank fairly quickly okay so
what happened to their business when you
started helping them and is it still
around today what happened to It
ultimately yeah yeah it's still around
the website's build yourjacket decom I
mean my parents are older now and my
dad my dad got shot has not fully
recovered it's a pretty crazy story
that'll be well it was nine years ago
but it hasn't recovered anyway that's a
crazy story for a different pod yeah it

[06:00]
crazy story for a different pod yeah it
was a freak accident but anyway so it's
still going the business he doesn't push
it as hard as he used to because he
doesn't have as much energy and he's in
his 60s now but at the time no I mean
they were killing it it was going super
good and so they had a retail sporting
good store as well at the time and so
the website started doing so well that
they sold that off and and didn't do
that anymore and they just went all in
on the website interesting they sold the
retail store went all in on the website
y interesting okay so yeah this was just
an idea that they had from scratch mhm
yeah yeah my dad yeah okay so you
started with SEO and then like did you
start pulling more levers with them like
all right let's try Facebook ads or did
you start pulling those levers with
other customers yeah no so this started
in 08 08 to 09 was mostly SEO then
Google PPC started and then a Facebook
page was probably 09 or 2010ish when I
started pushing that harder for them and

[07:00]
started pushing that harder for them and
then it just kind of went from there
Twitter Reddit early days of Twitter
helped a lot it it was actually really
good because I set up like advanced
search trackers where anytime somebody
would say custom letterman jacket or
varsity jacket in the same tweet then I
would set up like a auto reply like hey
go go go make your own build jacket.com
you know and yeah I mean it just kept
scaling from there as all these new
social platforms and and mediums popped
up okay so here's a question you've seen
like the evolution of social media over
the years like you've seen things come
and go you were around you could post a
link to a Blog on Facebook and that blog
would just get millions of free clicks
right what are some stories from like
the best like just the most asymmetric
opportunities you've ever seen like that
went away right call call it a maybe
it's a growth act that you employed or
like the first three months of Facebook
pages Facebook pushed them so hard that
you were making a ton of money creating

[08:01]
you were making a ton of money creating
Facebook pages for people and they were
seeing amazing results that just weren't
lasting I would love to hear some
stories about that the asymmetric bet of
let's say Google PPC was like before my
time so that was more like 2 three four
five six maybe like 4 Cent clicks yeah
yeah so the first big one that we
started to really capitalize on at the
agency was Facebook ad especially for
e-commerce
so the ability to get five six 8 10x row
as we don't even use that term anymore
but that was not that hard the hardest
part for our clients was managing their
finances properly and frankly just being
able to get enough inventory in the door
because there weren't like it was harder
when Facebook ads were going great it
was harder at that time to get like the
types of credit cards that you can get

[09:00]
types of credit cards that you can get
now where you don't have to pay things
for 90 days you know so anyway that was
the first asymmetri bet and Jesse from
ampush
he has a or sold a massive agency they
were like the best at capitalizing on
that period of time but yeah that was
the first one and that's so we did a
good job of that I would say nothing
amazing though but in seeing that I
guess it sort of taught me and us that
next time something new came let's jump
on it quickly so when Snapchat came we
started on that super quick we were
actually the first agency partner of
Snapchat and that was amazing if you got
on it early as a brand Tik Tok we were
the first agency that was doing stuff on
Tik Tok that was huge at the start for
and a start I mean the start was like
two years long so and I don't think
that's going to stop there's a limited
amount of apps and websites that can

[10:02]
amount of apps and websites that can
make it out of it these days and last
but there's always going to be
opportunities if you are an early
adopter and go super hard I'm curious
what stories you can tell of a customer
that you had that like really went all
in on snap chat and they saw crazy row
ads or crazy download numbers I'd love
to hear something like that so like
acorns was a a finance app have you are
you familiar yeah yeah so they were our
client they we started with them
when they were still in beta and so when
they launched we went all in on Snap
that's what we went all in on for ads
and so it was ads for the app download
obviously it was an IOS app and it was
insane I don't know what I am allowed to
say or not to say but they really
quickly I mean we got tens of millions
of downloads in under a year holy cow
yeah I mean they blew up and they're
still a big company like they're still
doing fine right oh yeah yeah man yeah I

[11:02]
doing fine right oh yeah yeah man yeah I
think too many people worry about like
diversification of me media channels
this these days or advertising channels
or whatever you don't need to worry
about that unless you're probably a nine
fig company yeah like even when you're
still eight Figures it's like just
Master one or two channels yeah it's
it's funny like eight or nine months ago
I posted a tweet about our tree care
business and I was like here's the 32
places we get leads from and like it
tweeted really well and I felt really
good about myself and then one of the
comments was like this just kind of
tells me that you haven't mastered any
of them I was like oh oh dang it I want
to clap back to that but you're right
it's like well I mean platform risk is
real right like it's very real but like
if you're getting a positive roaz return
on ads spend why not just plow all the
money you can into it especially if
you're acorns and you have no physical f
F fillment it's just apps yeah I mean

[12:02]
F fillment it's just apps yeah I mean
there's not like a perfect recipe but I
would say something like
80% of your focus should be on maybe two
channels and then 20% testing the other
12 to see what might become the third
channel so you can make sure that you
are mitigating against platform risk but
you should really try to figure out how
to truly crack two channels all right if
you are watching this clip right now you
are watching this on YouTube and if you
are a fan of podcast please check out my
podcast while you're at it because
sometimes I have podcasts that aren't on
YouTube and sometimes I have YouTubes
that aren't on podcast so check out the
Kerner office on any podcast platform or
you can go to TKO pod.com also my
newsletter will throw that in there
there are no ads It's weekly it's
different content than my podcast and
YouTube newsletter. chrisj cerner.com
You'll see the link and we'll see you
there now this is kind of a tangent a
little bit but what do you think about
all of the direct consumer brands that
went public or even the ones that didn't
go public and they just blew up tens

[13:01]
go public and they just blew up tens
hundreds billions of dollars of Revenue
and really what you're looking at is a
Shopify store and Facebook ads right
that's the whole business and it sounds
like I'm oversimplifying it because
e-commerce is very hard like it's much
harder than almost everyone thinks so
it's just hard right but you see these
companies go public figs and like none
of them have done well Alberts Casper
figs like they do well at first and then
they don't and the phrase that comes to
my mind that I repeat all the time is
that which is easily gained is easily
lost and it's like with Texas snacks we
do paid ads but our organic customers
that like seek us out they return more
and they spend more and they're just a
better customer and it's like they kind
of had there was more friction to find
us but that friction translated into a
better customer do you have anything to
say about that yeah so Casper is
actually one of our clients pre IPO okay
I'm trying to pull up this twe as we're
talking somebody ranked the all these D

[14:02]
talking somebody ranked the all these D
Toc Brands and their returns since they
went public and the only one that's
positive of all the big ones is HS it's
the only one oh and it's a it's really a
pharmaceutical company I mean yes and
one that is riding a massive wave right
now of multiple things and who happens
to be a consumable it's not a mattress
right or a pair of shoes or whatever
that you don't buy every month so that's
one part of it of why hims is still
doing well but all the others are not
but all the others I I I'd have to look
at the exact list but they pretty much
all blew up during that Facebook ads
crazy awesome time that's when they blew
up and then so what happens they blew up
they got investment and then they had
too because of that but in in their
growth how many mattress brands exist
now yeah Casper was the Pioneer but

[15:01]
now yeah Casper was the Pioneer but
there are so many because they all saw
oh Casper's doing this let's go take a
little piece so because of their own
success it inspired so many copycats
that all specialized in a little niche
or whatever and are taking their revenue
at least part from them same with I
don't think that's happening as much
with figs but all birds and you know all
these other ones so I think that's their
demise that coupled with just the fact
that Ecom is really hard and AD costs
have risen a lot since 2016 2015 yeah
what was Casper's customer acquisition
cost in like the Heyday do you remember
it was pretty cheap at first and then
and they were growing really fast and it
was going really well and they were
doing and we were helping them with some
cool stuff they had a they had a Blog a
separate website about sleep and it had
a bunch of content on there and we ran

[16:00]
a bunch of content on there and we ran
that actually for a while they would do
like cool campaigns where they would
have like nap pods and they'd go to like
festivals and roll up with these nap
pods you could take naps in them so I
think they were doing a great job anyway
that was the time when they were scaling
like
crazy and then I think maybe when they
got I don't know series C Series D is
when they started getting to the point
where they had to keep up with the
growth rate that they were already
achieving but they couldn't in as a
profitable of a way right so then they
started to achieve basically Break Even
CAC and potentially even negative for a
while and it hasn't gone well since the
ipoed so I mean that's one thing if
you're going to keep buying pills every
month but if you're not going to buy
another mattress for a decade you're in
trouble yeah yeah exactly what were they
spending to sell one mattress like in
the Heyday if if you remember 20 bucks
200 no probably 100 for $1,000 mattress
man with like 80 % margins too right or

[17:01]
man with like 80 % margins too right or
70% yeah it was high jeez yeah okay so
Facebook had the Heyday and people like
what's different about all the
e-commerce Brands making profitable
businesses today on Facebook ads like
they just have it's their products with
bigger margins or more recurring or both
I think the brands that are doing well
now are just so much more dialed in than
you had to be8 years ago okay so I don't
know theor thed out yeah yeah but they
just have like their inventory is is so
dialed in and their supply chain and the
product costs and their teams the the
leanness of their teams even like
everything basically if your primary
growth engine is ADS which that is the
case for most Ecom businesses then you
you have to basically be perfect on

[18:01]
you have to basically be perfect on
every single other aspect of your
business mhm cuz if you're not then
either a a normal competitor of yours
normal being another apparel brand so if
you have viori over here and like Alo
aloe yoga over here if viori has
everything buttoned up and aloe doesn't
viori is gonna win right but
if also who they have to compete with is
shien and timu and Amazon and Walmart
who are all running ads if you Google
yoga pants for women all of those brands
are running ads some of which are
willing to lose money or a lot of money
on every click also the younger
generation is becoming more okay with
dupes and stuff so that's why you have
to have every single aspect of your
business style in if as it's going to be
one of your primary growth drivers how
has that affected your business because
I imagine a big part of your business at

[19:00]
I imagine a big part of your business at
least at one point was a Shopify store
plus Facebook ads so as that started to
die what does your business look like
today and what was that transition like
I started a I ended up working in
finance and then I quit that was 2012
right before I we had our second kid and
so I joined with my friend and we
started doing this thing and we started
just with small companies and then kept
growing and then anyway we became a full
service agency just because anytime
someone said oh can you do this my
answer was yes and so that's how we
became a full service agency and we were
pretty good at some things and maybe
great at one and okay at others anyway
in 2017 we decided to go all in on
social ads for
e-commerce and cut everything else out
for e-commerce specifically yeah so just
socialize for e-commerce because we saw
that those two basically waves were
going to be the best not even
no not even Google it was really just

[20:01]
no not even Google it was really just
Facebook ads Instagram ads 2017 so
Snapchat ads maybe a little Twitter and
Reddit okay yeah and so we anything else
comes SEO email web design whatever we
referred it out then
we started spinning up other agencies
because I was mad at how much money we
were referring out yeah so it's tough
yeah so we found a guy to run a new
company that focused on SEO and that
started going well you were still kind
of referring it out but to your own
company yeah yeah that had its own like
day-to-day operator different bank
account different Equity structure and
we so we had one Wallaroo became full
service then one thing then it became
seven different agencies with seven
different operators and me and my
co-founder what were the
seven it was ads email SEO web

[21:01]
seven it was ads email SEO web
design social media a smaller version of
ads and nil stuff for college athletes
oh shoot okay just throw that in there
yeah me and my co-founder were over
those seven so each had their own
day-to-day operator their own bank all
that right their own set of clients of
course there was a lot of overlap with
clientele but yeah so we were just
trying to help them all grow and all
that kind of stuff I'm saying this
because had I not done
this we would have continued to scale
greatly with that initial idea of just
focusing on social ads free Commerce but
we got distracted by this shiny idea of
running like a hold Co or whatever and
because the first one that we started
was going really well so anyway only
like a year and a half ago did we fold
the seven now into
two okay so Wallaroo still exists and

[22:02]
two okay so Wallaroo still exists and
does everything on the paid side
advertising creative management blah
blah and then we have another one called
arvo which basically does stuff on the
organic side but both Focus largely on
e-commerce so what would you say to
people that say don't chase shiny
objects focus focus focus to saying no
to a thousand things obviously you can't
blanket statement to say it's bad idea
or it's bad advice it's good advice how
is that advice played into what you've
done and how do you feel about it
looking back with the benefit of
hindsight I mean I know that if I hadn't
done that and even if I had focused
earlier than when we started to go all
in on social ads we would be at more
Revenue at least let's say twice what
we're at now if not much more let's say
but I think the amount of lessons I
learned in all that will pay more than
that over time so I guess I don't regret
it so I guess you just have to decide do
you want to go through learn by messing

[23:02]
you want to go through learn by messing
up a bunch or do you just want to focus
on one thing only and and go hard on
that I I don't necessarily think there's
a wrong route I agree yeah like I always
say compounding doesn't care you just
stay in the game yeah so you're saying
that if you would have only focused on
social and e-commerce you'd be twice as
big despite what happened with Facebook
ads iOS 14 and all that yeah if not
three times as big probably to be honest
and why do you think that is like
specifically
because it's easy to be like well like
yeah how could you have been so much
bigger well partially the wave that we
were writing was such a good one and
still is but we missed we were less
focused on the key years so that was one
and two when me and my business partner
first just started this thing our goal
was always to step away so we can have
more time with our wife and kids and
just like during this key years when
your kids are teenagers and stuff
basically have the unlimited time to to
spend with them before they're gone out
of your house that was always the goal

[24:01]
of your house that was always the goal
and we saw this as a way to accomplish
that but we I think did it too soon and
also underestimated how difficult it is
to find great operators to scale things
up and you know there's different skill
sets needed to go from zero to one or 1
to three or 3 to 10 and we thought we
could teach these seven different people
how to do it all but we didn't even know
how to do it all yeah so
yeah we just I don't know got a little
cocky or or got a little too excited or
whatever and but I mean it's going good
now I have no complaints but I I there's
a lot of lessons that we learned that's
for sure yeah would you mind speaking to
that on like the size of your business
today vers at its peak and like how big
the seven businesses were in like rough
ranges when they were all separate and
not two different
entities yeah so when I would say the 12
months before we did that first spin-off

[25:00]
months before we did that first spin-off
Wu probably
did a million and a half okay and then
we started doing the spin-offs or
whatever and then that first one which
was called pouch we renamed it to arvo
which is the name that still stands that
one in its first year probably did let's
say like
500k okay and then the others the web
design the social the web 31 all the
others they were probably all between
150 and like 400k in their first year
and then some started to be a little
more none of them were that profitable
though like maybe between five and 12%
CU you weren't really at scale with them
yeah yeah end of 2018 and then 2019 2020
2021 end of 2022 is when we shut them

[26:01]
2021 end of 2022 is when we shut them
shut them down and merg them back into
two but like now this year we'll
probably do like eight plus million wow
yeah but we never got over with the
seven we never got over in a single year
like
three it's just too much yeah it's a lot
to wrap your arms
around yeah especially because six were
new right yeah if they had been
more staggered it would have been more
doable maybe but it was literally like
six were launched within 12 months yeah
and with where the business stands today
what is like the 8020 of your rep like
you do a bunch of different things what
are you doing the most of we don't do
that much so I mean walero manages ads
for e-commerce businesses arvo does SEO
email and cro for okay largely e-com
optimization yeah yeah
and the two in my head they're basically

[27:01]
and the two in my head they're basically
one but about 5050 as far as Revenue
goes interesting it doesn't usually
shake out like that it sounds like youve
obviously it took you a while to get
there but it sounds like you've landed
in a good spot yeah the two guys who run
each of them the two CEOs of each
they're amazing we recently my my
co-founder and I brought on a sort of
like an official board member to be over
them two because we're at where they're
at I've never gone past that
business-wise so as much podcast
listening and Twitter studying I can do
I still haven't done it in practice and
so admitting that to myself and to them
by bringing on this other person and
giving him an incentive structure based
off of the Delta of his basically he
gets Equity or he has equity and it's
the difference of our valuation when he
started which was like two months ago
and when we sell and so he gets a chunk

[28:00]
and when we sell and so he gets a chunk
of that Delta right I like that so he's
very incentivized to help us get
Acquired and he comes with from the
world of m&a and Consulting and stuff so
he has a ton of experience and has done
like 40 Acquisitions so he is you know
going to just bring in this new um
perspective that we haven't had before
yeah that's awesome of all the things
you're doing zero email paid all that
what do you love like what business just
kills it for you guys to what Revenue
line ads the most still I think people
always love ads clients let's say
because it's just the fastest it's the
fastest way to
immediate unless they can go viral
consistently like you do on social media
other than that yeah ads is is the
quickest way to revenue and so they just
love Dollar in dollar out and
essentially it's a math equation with a
lot of creativity involved so if you can
solve that then you can scale it we just
have to be a little more choosy than we

[29:00]
have to be a little more choosy than we
used to on who we say yes to that wants
to hire us because if it's just a
run-of-the hill shoe brand we're
probably not going to be able to help
them because they're probably not have
all the yeah yeah so yeah like you'll be
set up for failure because they have an
inferior product as yeah yeah yeah that
might not sound politically correct but
it is what it is are you guys like
actively doing outbound to more
customers right now or are you just
keeping it going growing organically we
rank for a lot of stuff we do a little
bit of ads for ourselves we get a lot of
referrals so yeah we don't do any
outbound every time I hear you mention
you talk about outbound on your pods I'm
always intrigued by like oh man I wonder
if that could work for an agency like
ours but no we don't do that in the past
we did here and there but it would
be it would just be manual it'd be like
I would find a Cool brand on Instagram
that I know we could scale and I would
just find the founder and be like hey I
would love to chat with you I have some

[30:01]
would love to chat with you I have some
ideas on how you could grow did that
usually work pretty well it worked super
well yeah I mean that's how I
find go ahead no no you go I was gonna
say that's how I find cool people for
the podcast I'm just on Instagram and
I'm like I want to talk I want to talk
to you yeah yeah and especially if
you're coming with I mean in my
perspective if I'm coming with value of
course they can see through it and they
probably know that I want to get them as
a client but I'll literally say like I
have an idea for this for you and this
and this and I'll give you all my ideas
and advice on a call and if you want to
hire us awesome but if not no worries
yeah and you mean it they see that yeah
I'm curious what you think because I
always tell young people like oh what
should I do Chris what do I start what
do I do what should I learn what skills
should I learn and like I feel like when
it comes to technical knowledge people
they always revert to coding like I need
to learn how to code so I can build an
app and like I always tell them learn
paid ads like really really learn it and

[31:01]
paid ads like really really learn it and
or learn cold email and you might start
an agency with that or you might start a
business with that but if you can learn
one or two or both of those like you can
do anything you want in the world would
you agree with that or what kind of
tweak might you put on that advice no I
agree but I guess my little tweak would
be learn sales those are basically
mediums for sales right so you one is
sales via the written word one is sales
in the ad scenario that's some written
word of course but images or videos or
just actual sales like on a phone or
over video or in person because that
skill AI is never going to be able to
touch yeah if you can actually convince
somebody why they should go with you and
why you're going to help them make more
money if you can become good at that
you'll always have six figure minimal
job agreed one reason like I've always

[32:00]
job agreed one reason like I've always
thought if I ran an agency it would be
like shiny object overload because I'd
be seeing how much money I'm making my
clients an ad agency specifically and
it's like oh I'm going to go start an
app that's just like acorns I'm GNA go
start selling these Marino wool shoes
just like all birds like they have a 10x
row as I'd be all over the place have
you ever been tempted has there ever
been a client you've had like oh man I
I'd love to hear a couple stories about
that and you can bleep out the client's
name if you want but just more generally
speaking I don't know necessarily I mean
yeah we've had clients that I've wanted
to copy whether it was that I didn't
think their product was that good and
they were killing it
or maybe I didn't like the client they
were super rude and and they were
killing it but yeah we've tried in the
past we've tried to launch e-commerce
Brands ourselves but it would we always
like it always got pushed to the side
because we were always getting more
clients and they were paying the bills
and we never gave gave it the focus so
every single time it failed there's not

[33:00]
every single time it failed there's not
a great way for an agency owner to come
up with a structure for their team where
they'll be excited to work on a side
e-commerce
Venture even if I say hey I'll give you
10% Equity well that actually means
nothing like when are we even going to
do a distribution from an Ecom brand
it's going to take three years yeah
before the first one would happen and
meanwhile they like regular ads manager
so it has never worked out until more
recently we kind of figured it out so
we're doing a couple now that are
growing and and going better but it
because yeah e-commerce but it was
because we chose to not do that it's
just like hey we'll use our
agencies we will treat them as paying
clients we will have them pay we'll just
subsidize it but like compensation
structure will still be the same to the
people who are working on it and maybe

[34:01]
people who are working on it and maybe
with some extra little bonus and that's
the seems to be the way at least for us
that it's working out in the past when
you chose one that failed what type of
product was it I did like stuff with
like wheat grass like over a decade ago
let's see we've done supplements which
is a competitive
space yeah we did we did hoverboards and
before they caught fire yeah so here's
what happened with that one it was going
well not it was going well not like
insanely well but well and then I got us
I I was doing our Amazon I I I figured
out Amazon and anyway I kind of
accidentally figured out something good
in the buy box on Amazon and it was at
night and so then it was like late at
night and the first one that like got on
the news of going on of catching on fire

[35:02]
the news of going on of catching on fire
happened and so I like ran this sale I
don't even know how I did it on the buy
box that really hit the point is the
next morning we sold out we sold every
single one fully out that we had and I
got out of it and then it was literally
like the next day there was like news
stories all over seven new ones got CAU
on fire luckily ours never caught on
fire but yeah had make from that
oh that was good yeah that was six
figures geez yeah blender company yeah
six figures in one one overnight so that
was fun to wake up to but it was
stressful yeah blender was good and then
like we ordered a couple of the blenders
ourselves to test out and then like mine
like short circuited my house and then
it started smoking and I'm like what the
heck this is what we're because it was
from China this is what we're selling
and then I was like I don't know if our
insurance our liability insurance I
don't know if it's good enough so we got
rid of those fast yeah I don't know all

[36:02]
rid of those fast yeah I don't know all
over the place that's I love it I love
the specifics of these stories
hypothetical scenario Men In Black they
show up they wipe your slate clean it's
still
2024 well forget what I said they don't
wipe your slate clean everything about
marketing but your hands are tied you
cannot start an agency or a product line
that you've done in the past something
that you know you've seen it you've been
around it but you've never done it what
would you start to day I would do a
niche so like email marketing for either
a really high ticket item like Vehicles
like car dealerships or a B2B e-commerce
though that is a a massive under touched
industry that if you can focus on
something over there that would do
really really well what data point did
you see that taught you that about B2B

[37:01]
you see that taught you that about B2B
eCommerce or that it's under like do you
have like an anecdotal story where like
yeah because I heard of this one company
that's selling car parts to whatever I'm
very intrigued by this space so I'm
always consuming information whether
it's articles or these random companies
that report earnings that have a
subsidiary that does that right or just
random stuff I see on Twitter but I've
never actually seen anyone who's running
an agent agcy that's serving that
industry probably because it's not sexy
or cool do you think the margins have
something to do with it too maybe but
the orders are in bulk so I'm talking
like specializ in ads for restaurant
furniture for restaurants that are
buying furniture yeah and you get the
furniture the B2B Furniture comp you
know the chair companies you get them as
your clients that can sell 7,000 chairs
to this restaurant distributor or
whatever that's who you go after how

[38:01]
whatever that's who you go after how
would you charge uh percentage of AD
spend the CAC is going to be way lower
on something like that and even the LTV
is going to be way higher because once
you're an approved supplier in that
world You've Got It Made whereas on the
consumer side like if you sell t-shirts
this is a true classic tea like they
have to sell me again before I buy again
and but I have nine t-shirt brands that
I like so I'm just going to choose maybe
the next one on my next t-shirt P
purchase but that's not the case with
restaurant shairs now if you went the
Eco the uh email marketing route are you
saying that you would manage their email
marketing to like Market to their
current customers or you would send cold
email campaigns to acquire new customers
the latter yeah for sure and how would
you charge in that like a flat monthly
fee or percentage of revenue generated I

[39:01]
fee or percentage of revenue generated I
like starting with the flat monthly fee
because I think at least in I mean I do
have a lot of experience in the agency
worlds people really like to know what
am I
paying right now what am I paying this
month and next month but once you can
prove that you can deliver results then
the sky is the limit yeah so just do
like you know I would Char I would do a
three-month agreement at whatever for a
month show them results and then say
okay now it's double yeah and just keep
doing that what would you say to someone
that's just starting an agency or wants
to start an agency and they know that
their ticket price has to be 3,000 a
month and they're coming to you and
saying Brandon like how do I convince
someone to pay me $3,000 a month like
that's a ton of money obviously gets
easier once you have a track record and
testimonial but how do you get your
first $3,000 a month or 4,000 or 1,000
what's your tip there my advice to that
would just
be you so when I started my agency my

[40:04]
be you so when I started my agency my
first client was 150 bucks a month and I
just chose that number granted this is
2000 not so not kind of my parents 2009
was when I got my first client so 150
bucks a month and how many hours were
you spending on that client if you were
to guess per month 20 yeah let's say 20
a month yeah minimum wage oh yeah yeah
if not more more than 20 so but then the
next client was 200 a month and then 250
and I just kept doing that so basically
until until somebody said no then maybe
I would pause for a sec on the raising
and then we kind of settled into a
Groove but yeah you just got to keep
saying more this is like I feel like
this is the best advice of this whole
episode is that right there and it might
seem like obvious on the surface but
some people like Alex mosy might say you
know work for free just work for free

[41:00]
know work for free just work for free
and get some testimonials some case
studies and that could be good advice
too but it's just like what I hear from
you is just like don't do it for free
charge something because if they pay for
it they'll value it more they'll be more
invested to open and read your emails
and your reports and you're just going
to eat crap you're just going to get
paid a little bit to learn but it's like
you're going to University but you're
being paid minimum wage to attend yeah
exactly and especially when you're
starting out like
I'm sorry but you're probably not that
good you might be really smart and you
might be a hard worker but you're
probably not very good so you got to
kind of see it from their perspective
too or or put yourself in their shoes
but also I always like to think about a
client as if I have a client it's like
that's my client but I could get five
more from them if I do really really
good but if I don't then I'm for sure
then I'll lose them and I won't ever get
those other five because usually
business owners are friends with
business owners y so I want to do so
good for that client that I'll get those

[42:00]
good for that client that I'll get those
five referrals eventually whether it's
over the course of a year or two or five
years or whatever so every time I lose
one it's like ah that sucks because I
just lost six clients basically yeah and
so especially when you're starting out
that's how you should think now what
would you say back then when you charged
150 what was the market rate for the
same level of service that you were
providing like how much less was that
than Market that was probably like a six
a fifth jeez yeah so bucks pay seven
eight yeah 100 whatever yeah jeez same
question you're starting over different
agency how would you use AI to start an
agency because it's like there's two
camps like oh AI is going to change
everything and it is and it is changing
everything but at the same time it's
like there still needs to be AI
operators like I don't care how simple a
piece of software is I don't care you
click a button and it does all your ads
for you right oh crap now our secret
sauce is gone well you still need

[43:00]
sauce is gone well you still need
someone to click the button there are
still all these people that don't have
the time or they don't want to spend the
time to learn how to click that button
like so forever there's always going to
need to be operators for people to click
the AI button right so with that in mind
would you do anything differently is
there an AI tool that you would go
launch or an AI agency or an automation
agency um yeah yeah I I think unless you
have the app aptitude and I guess
passion and dedication to do a tool and
to have an immense amount of focus to
make sure that that tool is staying
ahead of the game because the AI
platforms that's like chat GPT and and
cloud and all them they're going to
continue to get so good that if you're
not updating your tool that's built off
of it you're just going to get left in
the dust because someone's just going to
come six months later and and be way
better than you so unless that's the
case I would actually focus on doing an

[44:04]
case I would actually focus on doing an
agency that that is using whatever tools
are the best at your disposal on the
back end at all times and can you give
some examples on tools so if it's a
whatever if it's an email marketing for
e-commerce be up front like say hey I I
do email marketing I do it for
e-commerce I only use AI tools for the
writing of your emails and the images in
your emails and the videos in your
emails all I do is I use chbt mid
Journey Runway ml whatever whatever
whatever you know that's all I do but
here's the benefit a I can do more than
your current agency I can push out more
and B they charge you 4K a month I only
charge you 2K so it's 2K it's going to
be more quantity per month it's going to
be the same quality and so if you can
figure that out on the back end which
shouldn't be that hard then you just

[45:00]
shouldn't be that hard then you just
have to have a killer of cold email
strategy basically to go out and get
those clients and and tell your story oh
that's so good I love it because even if
you don't say we're cheaper people have
the expectation that it's cheaper right
so you say we only use AI tools hey
here's all my cards I'm pushing them
over this is what we're doing I'm not
writing these emails nope AI generated
this this this you throw a bunch of
tools at them they're like wait what's
this wait what and then you don't even
need to say we're cheaper it's like that
means I'm a 10x agency at the same price
right and maybe your market rate is 3500
and you're 3500 and you might actually
be cheaper but they're like man or you
might be more expensive they're like man
and it's cheaper of no they're like of
course he's cheaper because he's using
all these tools he doesn't but really
what that means is you have better
margins right because you don't have all
the
overhead yeah and the benefit is you can
say you don't you don't have to write it
down yet you can say hey I use AI I'm

[46:02]
down yet you can say hey I use AI I'm
cheaper and I'm going to push out more
than your current agency then when you
get them as a client and you find out
their current agency let's say is
getting paid 4K a month and they're
doing four emails a month now you know
if you're charging 3K you only have to
do five emails to be like double better
3K for five instead of 4K for four so do
3K for five do that that for two months
and then do and if you do a three-month
contract on month three do seven emails
instead of five yeah and guess what
they're going to renew because you just
almost doubled their emails that they
were getting from the previous agency
and you probably have a good Cadence now
to where your margins in month four and
onwards should be able to be even better
than they were in the first three months
and you can now do eight emails two a
week yeah so it's like even if it's more
expensive it's more value so yeah it's a
win that way yeah yeah and you keep
increasing the production over time and

[47:00]
increasing the production over time and
on month 13 you're now doing 19 emails a
month and if let's say you started at 3K
you can say hey I know you were paying
four for four I'm three for 19 I'm
actually now five for 19 but I'm
assuming you're going to be good with
that because it's for 19 right and
they're like yeah I'm good with that
yeah when you're when your marginal cost
of production is so small then you you
just build Goodwill for 12 months by
sending more emails than you promis
delivering more value than you promis so
on month 13 it's like hey price is going
up 80% but you're cool with that right
because my fulfillment went up 800% oh
yeah no problem yeah exactly so you've
got someone looking at you and they're
star eyed and they're listening like I'm
gonna start an agency I'm gonna oh this
is GNA be amazing I'm I just need 10
customers playing paying 30 three grand
a month and I'm gonna make 30 grand a
month 90% growth margins how would you
what water would you pour on that fire
it's like oh whoa whoa whoa whoa listen
like these are the things you got to
watch out for because it's a lot
freaking harder than it looks I would

[48:01]
freaking harder than it looks I would
say getting a client is harder than ever
these days that's why sales is such an
important skill to our earlier
conversation so that's number one you
better be a killer salesperson you can't
just have a great sentence uh and expect
that to be the thing that closes all
your clients right so you need to either
be really charismatic or really
persistent or both or whatever so that's
number one and number two there 's this
little Matrix that we have internally
here where if the results you're getting
for your client are bad but your
communication is great yep then you'll
actually probably keep them long enough
to where you can get the client the
results to be okay so true and then
there'll still be a forever client right
if your uh results are great and your
communication is horrible you actually
will probably still lose them so you
have to have either good or great
communication and and either good or
great results but great communication

[49:00]
great results but great communication
can buy you the time while the results
are sucking which may happen every now
and then because this thing abs and
flows so I would just really dial in
your communication and overc communicate
to the point where your client could
potentially be annoyed because you're
sending too much information to them
yeah better do it in a good way yeah
talk about like even if they're a
chiropractor and you hate
chiropractors just talk about like hey I
was just I just wrote this email for you
and actually or AI did or whatever and I
learned this new thing about
chiropracting like I didn't even know
that you guys you could do this and this
that is so cool you you work in such an
awesome mystery there's one point of
communication for the month but now
they're seeing like your passion for
what they do and even that goes along
they like you more they just like you
more they're gonna be less likely to
fire people numbers yeah exactly it's so
funny like we have a lot of the same
Frameworks especially when you're in a
hard business like I was in third party
Logistics
you've been in e-commerce so you
probably know how hard that business is

[50:00]
probably know how hard that business is
however hard e-commerce is 3pl is even
harder and I would tell my employees
that every day I would say communication
covers a multitude of sins like yes
here's the bad news we clicked the wrong
button and we sent 1300 packages to the
wrong people sorry here's the good news
we're telling you about it right now so
yeah oh man so true that's good so you
would basically say over Comm unicate
and don't underestimate how hard it is
to acquire a client but to acquire a
client eat crap for a few months getting
paid minimum wage and then keep in mind
how you got that client was probably
away from another agency that's probably
not a bad agency and someone's coming
for your client now so that's why you
have to overcommunication and sort of
always like
resell why they should stay with you
would you rather take a client from
another agency or take a client that has
never done paid ads before oh man I love

[51:00]
never done paid ads before oh man I love
taking clients from other agencies
especially if they're our main
competitors because there's a contrast
right yeah yeah I I actually like it
more coming from another agency because
then they already they've already been
they already know how it is yeah and so
yeah yeah much better same with the 3o
world cuz it's like whoa whoa whoa you
didn't this order was placed an hour ago
you haven't shipped it yet it's like bro
do you know how this works we have other
clients but if they came from another
agency it's like oh my gosh this order
was placed two days ago and you already
shipped it oh you guys are
amazing yeah totally man well I'm out of
questions but this was amazing thank you
