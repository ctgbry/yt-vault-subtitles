here's a business opportunity I promise
you've never heard of it's got high
margins cost almost nothing to start and
the demand is growing so I've worked in
the industry before and I'm going to
tell you how to copy this this company
sells 3 million ice cubes per year at $1
to $10 a pop you do the math on that
luxury clear ice is a big business but
you don't have to have a lot of money to
start it this website going on behind me
used to be a customer of mine we would
ship their clear ice around the country
with dry ice and they sold it for
hundreds of dollars now to copy this
business I would start by using my free
scraping guide and scraping all the
restaurants in your area that are3 to5
signs in price then once you make your
ice cubes you can stop by right before
they open and give them some samples for
free then you stop by a week or two
later and try to sell them this business
is beautiful because it's recurring and
you're selling water you can still
differentiate yourself by putting things
in the eyes or carving the eyes you can
do this locally you could sell kits you
could have tasting events you could
teach a course or you can manufacture
these yourself and sell them to weddings
or local restaurants
