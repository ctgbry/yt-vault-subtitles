Most people overthink starting a business, but
some of the easiest wins are hiding in plain
sight inside of Google, Reddit, Facebook,
and even bad websites. So, in this video,
I'm going to show you how to find low competition,
high demand directory ideas that nobody else is
building. And at the end, I'm going to give you
five niches that I would build today. No product,
no audience, no code, just pure traffic plays.
Here's one of the most slept on online business
models right now. Directories. I put out a
video about it and you guys loved it. So,
I wanted to dive even deeper. And I
know directories sound kind of boring,
but that's kind of the point. They're
boring and they work. And here's why.
First of all, directories can rank stupidly fast,
especially if you're targeting the right keywords.
You don't need 4,000word blog posts. You don't
need backlinks. You just need to list the right
stuff in the right niche for the right person.
Second, directory websites can make money like

[01:00]
a vending machine. Set it up once and it starts
generating ad revenue, affiliate clicks, paid
placement, lead genen forms, whatever you want,
and you don't have to refill it with Fritos. It's
just sitting there on the internet working for you
while you're off building the next directory. And
the third reason, your competition is weak. It's
usually some busted broke WordPress site from
2012 that's run by a guy that hasn't updated his
favicons since the Obama years. That's going to
be your edge. If you show up with clean design,
strong filters, and a little SEO, you instantly
look and sound like the most legit option on page
one. And fourth, this is the real cheat code.
You don't have to be an expert. You don't have to
offer the service. You don't. In fact, you rarely
will. And you don't have to do anything except
organize all the noise. You're not the contractor.
You're the clipboard. You're not the one building
the house. You're just telling everyone else how
to do it. That's the play. And everyone else
can fight over running the actual service.
You're building the map. So, let me show you how
to actually find all these gaps. And we're going

[02:00]
to start with one of my favorite methods, digging
into the near me keywords inside of ahrefs. But,
we're going way past page one. And before you turn
this off, I know we already touched on this in the
last directory video/podcast, but we're going
to go a lot deeper than that little hack. So,
if you remember, you just want to search near me.
Go past page five, scroll past the obvious stuff
like McDonald's near me, Chipotle near me, and
boom, you're going to find these weird longtail
gold like goat rentals near me, or mobile car
tinting near me. So, that works. That's valid.
But I'm going to show you a few ways to go even
deeper. Number one, you're going to search in URL
colon directory. That's all one word, no spaces
in Google. And you're going to pair that phrase
with a niche such as in URL colon directory space
martial arts. And if you're watching on video, I'm
going to show you how that works real quick. In
URL colon directory space martial arts. So I see a
result for D magazine, which is Dallas magazine,
which makes sense cuz Google knows I'm near

[03:03]
Dallas. See a book about a martial arts directory.
I see a website called go number22carate.com which
is a directory of martial arts styles and then
result number seven I see a website entitled
directory of martial arts schools. I click on this
and holy AI generation. This website is 100% AI
generated which hey no shade from me and it's
a martial arts directory but let's see what ah
refs has to say about the competition on this.
We're going to click on keywords explorer type
in martial arts. Okay, keyword difficulty 57.
Search volume 44,000 per month in the US. Okay,
that looks a little hard to me. 57 is pretty
difficult. In the UK, it's even more difficult.
You have a 48 difficulty score and only about a
fifth of the traffic. Now, let's go back to Google
and look at in URL directory mobile dog groomer.
And while we're at it, let's see what ahref says
when you search martial arts near me. 37 keyword
difficulty, 33,000 search volume. Still don't like

[04:06]
it. Now, mobile dog grooming near me. 48 keyword
difficulty, 15,000 search volume. But when you
look at this on Google, the top two results are
newar local easy.biz and the holistic grooming
academy. I love the fact that abiz website
commands both number one and number two in the
organic search results. That tells me there's
promise here. AHFS tells a lot of the story,
but it doesn't tell the whole story. It's kind
of like the difference between looking at a house
on Google images or Google Street View and then
actually driving into the neighborhood. Sometimes
you just got to go there yourself to get a feel
for it. It looks like Local Easy is a TransUnion
company, so they clearly have a lot of firepower
on their side when it comes to backlinks.
Now, if we go to in URL directory bee removal
near me, I see the Texas Beekeepers Association,

[05:05]
Denton Aaggraive, which is a city in Texas, and
then I see bees-made-y.com, which is a beekeeping
directory that looks absolutely terrible, like
it's from the late '9s. Then I go to ah refs and I
type in bee removal near me. I see a four keyword
difficulty and a 5,300 search volume. This looks
like an amazing opportunity actually, especially
for a beginner. My point is when you use this in
URL directory Google hack, you find old, gross
websites ranking in the top five. Outdated links,
no photos, just junk sites. So if that's ranking,
then you can definitely build something better.
Here's another hack I love. Use this tool in
Google called Keywords Everywhere. You're going
to type in any local service. You'll scroll way
past the ads and the maps and then you'll look
for a little thing called people also ask and
related searches. So, here's how this works. I
make you free videos. I actually know what I'm
talking about. I have no greasy sales pitch at
the end. And if you implement what I talk about,
you'll make a lot more money and have a better

[06:01]
life. And all I ask for in return is that
you hit the subscribe button and maybe even
the notification bell just like that. Thank you.
I'm going to do this by searching HVAC near me.
If you go to the very bottom of the page, you'll
see people also search for. And then right past
the maps results, you'll see people also ask,
"How much does the average HVAC job cost? What
is the cheapest HVAC option?" Google is just
handing us free ideas for directories. You
can use these suggested keywords and search terms
to build a new directory. Then you can even look
at the modifiers within Google business profile
such as womenowned, minorityowned, accepts EBT,
kid-friendly. Those are all directory ideas.
Kid-friendly restaurant directory, womenowned hair
salon directory. These filters are things that
people are actively looking for and searching for
that most directories totally ignore. So instead
of just thinking of like best dentists near me,
you're going to build the best dentists near me
that take Medicaid and speak Spanish directory.

[07:01]
This is defensible and it's sticky. And another
move, go to Craigslist in the services section.
Boom. Right here, services and then skilled
trade is my particular favorite. Here you can
find real world demand, especially when you
look for random categories like labor/move or
farm plus garden. If people are posting about
it, there's demand. So don't overthink it. If
there's not a clean website that you can easily
find organizing all this stuff, there's demand.
That's your opening. And then my favorite hack
along these lines, you go to YouTube, you type
in best niche in city. See what shows up. If you
see someone ranking in the top YouTube search
results with some shaky vlog with only 400 views
and it's on page one, then Google is begging you
for something better. And that's going to be your
job. That's why we're here today. Let's try best
cookies. Cheyenne. The top result has 197 views.
All right. All right. Now, here's how you can find
spammy Google listings that are ranking purely by
accident and how you can eat their lunch with one

[08:01]
clean directory. This is the GBP section, Google
business profile, aka the Google map gold mine.
And I promise this is slept on. So, we're going
to use Google Maps to find some easy SEO wins that
almost no one is talking about. I like to call
it spam spotting. You're going to open up Google
Maps and search for something weird plus local
like mobile tire repair plano. Let's do that now.
So now we're going to scroll through the results
on the left side of the screen. Look at the names
of these businesses. If you see stuff like best
tree trimming McKini, Texas, or what we see right
here, Dallas Mobile Tire Shop, or Zohar Mobile
Tire Shop, North Texas Mobile Tires, they're
putting the exact match keyword in the name of
the business. I do the same thing whenever I buy
an RV park. I rename the Google business profile
city, state, RV park. Very simple. And my traffic
immediately goes up. So, no shade, but that's
an opportunity for someone to come disrupt this

[09:01]
category. Plumber near me, 24/7, dentist near me.
These are all examples of keyword stuffing. You're
looking for a business name that just sounds like
someone mashed a bunch of relevant keywords into a
business name. Map spam. These listings are going
to naturally rank purely because Google doesn't
have anything better to show us. Click into them.
What do you see? How does the website look? Is
there a website? This is the equivalent of naming
your business AAA locksmith back in the yellow
pages era. Do these websites have stock photos,
zero reviews, no lead form, no lead magnet, or
maybe it's a website that looks like it was built
in '07 by a dude named Chad. If that's what you
see ranking in Google Maps, then Google is starved
for legit results. So, here's what you're going to
do. You're going to document the keyword they're
ranking for. You can take the site, plug it into
ah refs or use a tool like keywords everywhere,
which is a Google Chrome extension. You do
that right there in the search. And then you're
going to ask yourself, could I build a one-page
directory that lists 5 to 10 real providers in
this niche in this city with clean filters and

[10:01]
legit info? If yes, then that's your play. And
here's a bonus for you. Open up the actual site.
Use a tool like BuiltWith with, and they have
a Chrome extension, too, to see what text stack
they're using. If it's Wix, Weebly, Squarespace,
GoDaddy, even better. Weak tech equals weak
competition. And you can beat them with a better
domain, a better host, web flow, WordPress,
real listings, real photos, real reviews. And once
again, remember, you can even build directories
around those filters like Open Now, mobile only,
kid-friendly. you are becoming the aggregator that
Google was hoping to find all along, but it had to
settle for the spam that showed up in your search
results. And if you really want to get tricky, you
can go to their Google business profile listing,
scroll to questions and answers, and you're going
to see stuff like, "Do you offer after hours?
Do you speak Spanish? Do you accept insurance?"
And then you can use tools like Manis, OpenAI's
operator, or Replet to go in here and scrape
all these things and find categories that have

[11:02]
a disproportionately high percentage of people
that offer these things. Kid-friendly, womenowned,
etc. Each question is a filter that people care
about. And you can add all of these filters to
your directory, or you can make a directory out
of one filter entirely. And then you just 10x
the value of what you're trying to do. But now,
let's go into Facebook groups. You know, I love
talking about Facebook. And one of the fastest
ways to crowdsource what people are already
searching for without guessing is, you guessed
it, Facebook groups. So, number four, we're going
to talk about Facebook group mining. And this one
is so obvious that it hurts, but almost no one is
doing it right. And there are millions of Facebook
groups. So, let's do this. Let's go into Facebook
groups because we are going to see where people
are actually asking for recommendations unfiltered
and in real time. This is hyper local demand,
hyper specific and relevant. It's kind of like
scraping search intent directly from the source.
So, you're going to start by joining a bunch of

[12:00]
local Facebook groups. Luckily, I have my personal
Facebook account pulled up and I'm in a ton of
groups over a hundred, mostly because I'm always
reverse engineering things just like this. Search
for things like moms of your city. My wife is in a
mom's group called Moms That Get Around. And it's
not what you think it is. It's just moms talking
to other moms about normal mom stuff. Also, by
the way, I do have a community called TK owners,
tkowners.com, where we talk about all these hacks,
and the best of the best stuff doesn't make it to
YouTube, FYI. Or you can search for things like
city contractors, Dallas contractors, Minneapolis
contractors, find all of the many Facebook groups
in those niches. State homeschool network, Alabama
homeschool network, weddings in upstate New York,
weddings in Tri Cities area. You want active,
messy groups with a ton of people that are quote
looking for something. Those two words are gold
to you. Looking for. Let's go into this group.
Airbnb booking verbbo host. 495,000 people in
this group. You think there aren't valuable

[13:01]
people in this group? A half a million people that
already own or want to own Airbnb properties. So,
let's go in here and we're going to search the
group right here. We're going to type in the
phrase looking for in quotations. Boom. Here's
what I see. Looking for recommendations. What's
the best course or resource for beginners
to learn how to launch a short-term rental
business? Oh my gosh, low hanging fruit. Please
sell me a course. Looking for recommendations for
business insurance for short-term rental business.
Of course, people get a short-term rental and they
either need or they think they need specialized
insurance. Looking for cleaner recommendations.
Looking for small business cleaning services.
looking for linen rental. Looking for recos
for a full-ervice property manager. So you could
use operator or manis to scrape all of these and
find the commonalities. What are people searching
for the most and or what are people searching for
most recently? Because maybe 3 years ago everyone
was looking for cleaners and then someone figure
that out and it's really not in demand anymore.
You can also search for terms like recommend

[14:02]
uh in quotations or anyone know a good dot dot dot
in quotations. Then you just start scrolling and
you'll start learning. You'll be seeing patterns
like looking for a mobile notary who's available
tonight. Anyone know a face painter for kids
birthdays? And you can even filter through these
things on the left. Post you've already seen, post
that are most recent, posts in certain locations.
This is a gold mine. Every single one of these
posts is a directory idea waiting to happen. It
doesn't mean that they're all going to be good
ideas. You still got to find two or three more
data points that back up your thesis, but is an
amazing starting point that you can't find in
AHEFs or Google or anywhere else on Facebook for
that matter. Quick question, what if there were
a private community out there of people that were
building businesses based on this podcast? Well,
I just made it and it's only for business starters
and business builders. It's called TK owners and
it's basically like having me and 100 other
business geniuses as your business partner,
but you give them 0% equity. Also, there's going
to be exclusive new trends, growth hacks, business
ideas, and a database of everything I've ever
talked about. You'll find thousands of startup

[15:04]
case studies. You'll have weekly ask me anythings
with me, while I'll answer your questions
directly. You'll be in my Slack channel where
I'm hanging out every week and helping members
one-on-one. We've got exclusive guest speakers,
including some names that you'll recognize. And if
you're building something cool, I'll introduce you
to anyone you need. TK Owners is the fastest way
to plug into a smart, ambitious group of builders.
and accountability partners that are sharing wins
without the fluff. And it's 99 bucks a month,
about the cost of an energy drink per day. You can
join now at tkowners.com, link in the show notes.
And then step three is you're going to build a
swipe file as you scroll. It's just a fancy way
of saying a Google doc or a Google sheet. You're
going to take screenshots of the best post. You're
going to track what are they asking for? How many
comments are they generating? Because every like
or a comment is another data point that says yes,
there is demand here. Maybe the comments all show
that the demand is already being met. People have
good cleaners. You got to dig into the comments.
The gold is really in the comments there. You

[16:00]
don't even really need to guess what filters
to add to these searches. They're giving you
the structure in the comments or in the original
post. And as a bonus, you can kind of ask without
asking. I like to say you make a post that says
something like, "Hey, if you could wave a magic
wand and instantly find the best insert category
here in town, what kind of filters would matter
most to you? What's your budget? Do you want it
to be mobile, kid-friendly? I'm just curious." And
let the group crowdsource your entire directory
user interface. You're going to get a list of
filters, keywords, service gaps. Maybe you find
there's no vegan restaurants in town. And you're
getting this data in real time from the most
relevant people in the most relevant markets.
Even a little messier, we're going to jump into
Reddit, which is a lot more chaotic than Facebook,
but also can be gold if you know what to search
for. And then there are some third-party Reddit
tools built on top of Reddit where you can get
even more out of Reddit. So this section, number
five, I like to call Reddit mining. Yes, Reddit.
It is full of trolls. It is full of chaos, but it

[17:02]
is also one of the most undererved platforms
for finding underserved service categories
straight from the mouths of frustrated users. So,
here's exactly how you mind it and how you find
directory gold. Step one, pick a subreddit.
You're going to be searching for subreddits
where people need recommendations or are planning
things. r/frugal, r/weddingplanning, r/by forlife,
r/personal finance, r/moving, r/hvac. A
lot of these communities are gold because
their engagement is so high. Just because it's a
subreddit with a lot of people doesn't mean it's
a good subreddit. A lot of the bigger ones are
toxic with poor engagement and toxic moderators.
You got to find the ones that are diamonds in
the rough. r/parenting, r/chronic illness, dogs,
vanl life. Each of these subreddits could be high
friction, highintent service categories. Step two,
you're going to use search queries like recommend
a or anyone know a good a or anyone know a good or

[18:05]
how do I find a good where to get a best blank for
blank. You're going to find posts like anyone know
a good dentist who doesn't treat me like crap for
not having insurance? like, "How's Google going to
answer that question for you?" Or trying to find a
therapist who takes Medicaid and actually answers
emails. There's no filter for that on Google Maps.
Or where do you find a mobile vet that doesn't
charge 300 bucks just to show up? Every single
one of those is a directory idea with emotional
urgency baked in. Step three, you're going to
analyze the comments and scroll the replies. What
names are coming up? I'm telling you over and over
on every platform, the gold is in the comments,
not in the like rate or the like ratio or even
the post. The comments are where people are having
difficulty finding answers to their questions. Are
people linking to sketchy sites in the comments?
Do the comments look like they're just bots and
they're full of emojis? Are people arguing in

[19:00]
the comments and saying, "Hey, I've been looking,
too." That's your demand. That's your validation.
You can build a clean site that lists just what
people are begging for in the comments. And then
in doing so, you could outrank the Reddit thread
itself. And if you really want to get tricky with
it, in any given subreddit, you can sort by all
time, by week, by month, by last year. Those posts
are golden. And it's also, side note, another
great way to reverse engineer how to go viral
in any given subreddit. Not that you're going to
want to do that for this directory idea, but it's
just a great little hack to know. When you sort by
top posts, you're going to find repeat questions
with hundreds of upvotes. Most of the times when
people are asking questions in Reddit, they're not
looking for when people have already asked that
question. So all of those up votes on the same
types of questions is pent-up demand. Furthermore,
you can piggyback on Google's search capabilities
to skip Reddit's awful user interface. So you're
going to type in sitereddedit.com/r/wingplanning

[20:02]
open quote recommend a close quote. That exactly
is a search query. Swap out wedding planning with
any subreddit. Swap out recommend a in quotations
with similar question queries. This is faster and
it's better because you still get the data from
Reddit but the user interface from Google. Also,
you can use tools to tools like Glasp to
highlight, save, and tag certain comment
threads as you're researching. There's all
kinds of thirdparty tools like that. One of
my favorite Reddit tools is called Gummy Search.
It costs like 50 bucks a month or something, but
I recommend using it for at least a month because
it will organize Reddit topics in ways that Reddit
doesn't do natively, and it can help you find
things that are trending on Reddit before they're
trending anywhere else. Forget directories. That's
just a great tool to use for reverse engineering
or researching any business idea. So now let's
look at some ways that we can pull ideas straight
from the filters that people are wishing exist,
but they don't. Okay, the filter gap. This is the

[21:03]
part that most people completely miss. The real
power in these directories isn't who you list,
it's how you let people filter. Because most
dedicated directories are only sorting by city
or category. That's too broad. That's too boring.
That's why people are bouncing. Real users don't
search like that. They're searching for things
like open late, kid-friendly, takes Medicaid,
speaks Spanish, pet friendly, kids safe,
femaleowned, LGBTQ affirming, on and on.
Now remember, those are filters, not categories.
So the play is to build micro directories where
the whole point is in the filter. So forget best
therapists in Dallas. do therapists in Dallas who
take sliding scale and actually answer emails.
So instead of like something like event venues
near me, you're going to do event venues that let
you bring your own food. Take a niche problem and
solve it with a single beautiful filter. Remember,
the beauty is in the filters here. So here's a

[22:04]
good real world example. Search for dentists that
take Medicaid near me, and you're going to find
outdated PDFs. You're going to find state websites
from 2009. You're going to find broken links. And
you're going to find people giving up in these
Reddit threads getting frustrated. Now, imagine
a world where there was a clean site that had
location, insurance accepted, languages spoken,
are walk-ins accepted or not, what are the weekend
hours? What are the holiday hours? Are the reviews
pulled into this directory site? You just built
the product Google wish it had to rank. Google
wants to show the best stuff and it's not there.
There's too many niches for everyone in the world
to cover. And if you really want to get smart with
it, remember what we discussed a few minutes ago.
You want to check out Google's people also ask
boxes because all of those questions equal a
filter and no one's organizing around them.
You're not trying to build a massive site or

[23:00]
the next Uber. You're building tiny answers to big
pain points. So, one of my favorite things to do
is to talk about tools. AHFS is good, but it's not
the end- all beall. So, I'm going to show you the
stack that I use to find these angles fast and
to build even faster. So, section 7 I'm calling
the tools stack. These are the tools that I
actually use. So, let's break it down. I just know
someone's going to ask, do I need a refs to do
all this? No, it helps, but it's not required. So,
here's what I actually use and how. Let's get it
out of the way. AHFS. I use it for two things.
finding weird longtail nearme keywords that no one
else is touching, looking at the volume attached
to those keywords, and plugging in spammy
competitors to see what they're ranking for
by accident. That's it. That's the 8020. You
don't need the fancy stuff. Tool number two,
keywords everywhere. This is a browser extension.
So, if you're on a budget, this is gold. It shows
the keyword volume inside of Google. So, you can
use it on Google Map searches. You can use it on

[24:01]
Reddit, YouTube, Facebook group threads. It's just
nice because you get instant validation. You don't
have to log in. You don't have to export. There's
no fluff. Number three, lowfruits.io. This is a
really niche tool that finds keywords where the
competition is more soft than average. Stuff like
SER equals Quora plus Reddit plus YouTube plus
low domain authority blog. That means you can
win. You can stack all these tools together with
this low fruits tool. and it'll even pull in the
people also ask questions. You can filter those by
niche. Number four, builtwith. I use builtwith and
the browser extension when I click on a spammy
site from Google Maps because it tells me are
they using Wix, Squarespace, GoDaddy, Web Flow,
WordPress. Most people think you have to pay 450
bucks a month to use BuiltWith with. But just use
their free browser extension. We're not doing this
at scale. We only need one or two sites to get
going. It'll also tell you if they have analytics
installed, what is their form builder, what CMS
powers it, if it's an old, outdated, janky tech,

[25:05]
then that's going to be one of your signals that
this is a good arena to compete in. Number five
is going to be Glasp or Evernote. You've probably
heard of Evernote. You can also use Google Docs or
your Apple Notes app. Don't get fancy with it.
You don't need Notion. This is what I use to
save Reddit threads or Facebook posts or random
weird search results and these niche directory
examples that I'm trying to swipe by later. I use
these tools to highlight stuff in real time as
I'm researching. I'll tag it, I'll sort it, and
then I'm done. So, video is cool, but you know
what's better? Long form audio via podcast and my
newsletter. tkopod.com. Go there to subscribe for
free to my newsletter. It's one email a week, very
tactical. And then go to my audio podcast. Three
episodes a week, stuff like this. You're going
to love it. All free. No sleazy sales pitch.
tkopod.com. Number six, Air Table. I really
prefer Air Table over Notion because it's more
spreadsheet friendly. It's more filter friendly
in my experience than Notion is. In Air Table, I

[26:00]
will keep a running list of niches. And if you're
not Air Table familiar, then Google Sheets is just
fine for this. I'll use different columns for the
keywords, the filters, the people also ask for
niches, domain ideas, tools that the competitors
are using, different revenue models. And if I
start seeing the same type of service requested
over and over across different platforms, then it
goes on my build this next list. None of these
tools really matter if you don't execute. And
that's why you're watching because we want you to
execute, right? So, in the next section, I'm going
to give you five ready to go directory niche ideas
that I would build myself today. And I'll tell you
exactly why they're wide open. You don't need to
trust me. Just look at the data. Okay. Section
eight, five directory niches I would build today.
You've seen all the tactics. I've shown you the
tools. Let's talk execution. These are the five
directories I built today with no hesitation. And
I'm basing these on real demand, low competition,
and clear monetization paths, not just on gut

[27:00]
feel. Number five, mobile dog groomers in rural
areas. Not suburbs, not big cities, rural areas.
Remember, most of America lives in a rural area.
These folks are out in the sticks and they've got
dogs. They probably have more dogs than we do out
in the city or the suburbs. And the big problem
is they don't have groomers nearby, but people
nearby know how to groom. They just don't have
established websites, so they're hard to find.
They don't have booking tools. So, you could
build a clean site that has things like listings
by zip code, travel radius, pricing, photos,
available this week, badges, and you're going
to make money through Legen or monthly featured
listings, or even you could just sell ads through
Mediavine. Idea number four, wedding vendors that
don't advertise on the knot. I've posted about
The Knot. They're not doing well right now. Now,
pun intended. They got bought out by private
equity and their customers are not happy. And
you know what? brides are tired of. They're tired
of digging through all the same 40 vendors on
The Knot that are just paying for top placement.
There's an entire second tier of amazing vendors

[28:02]
that hate advertising and only get referrals. The
Knot charges these vendors thousands of dollars a
year and they might not get enough leads from it
to justify that. So many of the best vendors are
not on the knot. So you could build a directory
for businesses like DJs, videographers, caterers,
photographers, event venues. All of these
people have never been listed on The Knot, Zola,
or Wedding Wire, the big three. And you could take
the David verse Goliath approach. You could market
it as antithen. Charge vendors a flat 20 bucks a
month instead of $5,000 a year just to be found
by cooler couples. Once you start to get product
market fit and people start to know and trust you,
then you can increase your prices later. Number
three would be therapists who take Medicaid and
respond to emails. That's a mouthful. It's not
going to be the full name of your business,
but it's going to be what your directory is known
for. The second part matters, responds to emails,
because the number one complaint that you get
about businesses like these is they never call

[29:00]
back or they never answer their phone or their
emails. So, build a directory that has filters
for insurance type, weight list status. You
they could get an email reply rate badge and
you could track it yourself. Filters for languages
spoken, gender, and specialty, so on and so forth.
You can monetize with affiliate links to therapy
marketplaces or you could even charge therapists
to upgrade their profiles or to have priority
placement. Okay, the number two directory I would
launch and I really really like this one. I almost
made it number one. It was really hard to choose,
but it would be event venues that let you bring
their own food. If you've ever tried to book a
wedding or a birthday venue, you know that this
can be a nightmare. Often time the catering
costs are significantly more than the venue cost
itself. Most venues are forcing you to use their4
to60 plus dollar a plate catering, but there
are places out there that let you bring your
own. They're just hard to find. There doesn't
need to be only one of these. There could be

[30:00]
multiple directories that offer this filter as the
core feature in all kinds of markets all over the
world. That one filter is the entire point of the
site. You could list out banquet halls, churches,
backyards, barns, whatever. You could use places
like peers to find venues that already do this and
scrape them from peers and add them to your site.
You can monetize through direct venue outreach,
upgrades, ads, on so on and so forth. And number
one, my favorite example of a directory niche that
you should start today is for used commercial
kitchen rental spaces because you know what's
booming right now? Ghost kitchens, meal prep, food
startups, cottage bakers trying to go legit. This
started booming during COVID and it hasn't slowed
down. And you know what all of these people need?
They need a health inspected kitchen to rent for
3 to four hours a week. These listings are buried
across Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, old
restaurant forums. You could organize them all

[31:00]
in one place and you could filter them by hourly
verse daily equipment included, certification
type, how much insurance is required, city or
zip code. You charge the kitchens to list on
your site and then maybe later you could take a
cut of bookings, but you need to get them using
your site first because the thing about all five
of these ideas is they could all be live within 24
to 48 hours. card, softer, web flow, it doesn't
matter. It's about solving a specific painoint
with real filters. So, let's wrap this up with
the fasttrack plan. Here's how you're going to
do this. Brass tax. Here's how to validate and
launch your directory in 24 hours without code,
without an audience, and without having to
guess. Section nine, validate and launch in 24
hours. Step one, you're going to pick your niche.
Remember, don't overthink it. Pick the one where
people are actively searching. I've already given
you all the tools and there's not a clear answer.
It depends on your preferences and your market.
And remember, the filters are going to be obvious

[32:01]
based on what people keep asking about. And if
you get stuck, just rewind this video a couple
minutes and steal one of my five ideas. Step
two, find 10 legit listings. Go to Google Maps,
Reddit, Yelp, Facebook, and search for people
who already offer the thing. You don't need
permission yet. Don't ask for permission. This is
called permission list. You just need enough data
to build a prototype directory. So you're going
to grab the name, city, link, one to two details
that matter like hours, pricing, mobile, etc. And
then you're going to go to step three, which is to
build the MVP, the minimum viable product using
card, software, notion, air table, tally. Also,
the Chrome extensions that I mentioned earlier
on, you're not building a full site. You're just
building a minimum viable answer to people's
question. The question I'm asking you is,
can someone land on your site and solve their
problem faster than Google? That's the bar you're
trying to beat. Step four, you're going to soft
launch it. You're going to post this in a local
Facebook group. You're going to DM a few of the
providers you have listed and ask them, "Hey,

[33:03]
I built this page to help people find service.
Would you want to be listed or featured?" If
two to three of them say yes, you've got proof.
And really, you could even do this before having
any website whatsoever. These people are either
going to be willing to pay, share, or promote
or not. The worst they could say is no. And step
five, you're going to add monetization. Something
basic like featured listings cost 10 to 30 bucks
a month. They'll have to pay for upgrades or extra
filters. And then you can even add affiliate
links if you're pointing to marketplaces.
You could also monetize with lead genen forms.
Collect the leads and sell them whenever you find
a buyer. It doesn't need to be perfect. It just
needs to be real. You just need to execute. So,
you're going to pick a pain. You're going to list
the options. Let Google, Reddit, and Facebook
hand you the demand on a silver platter because
you're not trying to build a tech company. You're
building the map to a problem that no one has
organized yet in that niche. And once it's live,
you're in the game. If you want me to build
one of these live on camera, step by step,
so you can see that I'm not just talk, then let me
know in the comments what the niche should be and
