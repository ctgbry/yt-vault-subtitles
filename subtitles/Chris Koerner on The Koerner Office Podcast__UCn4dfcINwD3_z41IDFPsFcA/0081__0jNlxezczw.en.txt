[00:00]
all right here we are we're in Nashville
Texas AKA Nash Vegas we're going to
pressure wash a
4,825 ft house in 25 minutes or less or
we're going to look like idiots and
nothing in between this is going to be
great so I've got my chip on my shoulder
in case you missed that I'm not going to
give you the address of this house
because I don't want you to come knock
on their door but I did I used my
incredibly accurate size 12 ft to
measure the perimeter of the house and
it is 35x 85 ft which equals about
29,000 ft and almost all of it has a
second story as you'll
see let's go I'm going to show my watch
it's 11:33 all right you guys ready in
the morning May 22nd
2024 I've got my chips on my shoulder
I've got my mic go let's
go wish I knew how to turn this dang
camera around

[01:04]
[Music]
really got to figure out how to turn
this camera
around oh double tap it there we go such
grandma all right still
11:33 so we've got a th000 feet of Hose
two rolls of Hose each 1,000 ft we've
got two guys they're each going to spool
the hose out all the way to the street
on either sides of the house and then
start spraying on their way back so
right here you've got vinyl siding and
right here you've got aluminum siding
that one's not going to look so great
afterwards because that's rust that you
see that one's going to look pretty dang
great afterwards cuz that's dirt that
you see

[02:02]
I'm not sure what the owners of this
house were thinking but uh it must not
have ever wanted to resell
[Applause]
[Music]
it see the Second
Story
oh I think my testosterone just went up
10 points
how does it feel uh
yeah I wake up every morning and I
just
nice how many stories up can that reach
can H stor obviously the wind is not uh
not giving me a problem

[03:04]
it's been two
minutes the duck underneath
beer smells like bleach smells like
capitalism
you didn't tell me I was going to get
wet the real question is can they do it
in 25 minutes even though I keep
stepping on their hose

[04:03]
it's all in the tip isn't
okay one
hand look at that trigger finger
oh

[05:12]
[Music]
now I got to be able to reach up in the
corner up in there I can change my
nozzle it's all in the tip that's
right we sure to pick a funky house huh
that's right figure might as well do a
difficult one

[06:05]
see changing
colors how many Watchers right now are
just dying to say that you missed the
spot sure a lot of more but
got TR to let the to
work part the way a little bit
faster let the do the
work so you're letting it soak first
that's right we'll come back and we'll
rinse it off so this is cheep one two
step process okay

[07:05]
hey babe Jesse wife I hope you're not
watching this
because I still can't do things around
the house I can just hold a
[Music]
farm it and really effective and you can
see it's not a heavy lift in about you
know
that level of pressure so you know for
for those who have doubted on ability to
kind of do this
[Music]

[08:06]
man look at those Cals I mean
honestly we'll be honest here for a
second with each other it's just you and
I right
[Music]

all I can do here watching the whole
thing
[Music]

if you hang around a power washer long
enough you will get bleach on I got L of

EPA is coming after us the EPA is fully
aware that we use

up there you
go take me out of
truck take the power wash sure
to have these back in the franchise
where I'm actually able to get back a
little bit with the knowledge I do have
uh help these guys you know better their
companies
and I mean that's what it's really all
about to me
amen get so excited when I see some of
these guys you know pulling you know 30
$40,000 first month like
Inc I think it's what our founding
fathers in

[14:00]
fathers in
I I agree with
you so tell me about the
brick the brick is not that bad you see
that White Street coming down on the
brick yep we would
normally
there off
I'm
get but for the most part like
this com down off the
got for something like that we would
have to
add um a different process that we would
use and have to spray it on um we would
normally do it after we wash house
anyhow
okay I don't know

[15:06]
how many gallons of water you think you
go through at this house uh we're going
to be
close
900 uh say probably
450 could be off a little bit but
CL I like to over r a little bit CU you
don't want uh the chemical that we're
using to
this um not get R off the
house yeah you really want to make down
well um we always R the top down as you
can see that tall of
these and you can even see like
the while you're rinsing down I'm going
to be rising down

[16:03]
that's the K that's
[Music]
right we're at 15
minutes yep
[Music]
