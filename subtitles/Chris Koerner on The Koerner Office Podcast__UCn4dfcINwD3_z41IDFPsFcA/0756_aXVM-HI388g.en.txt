How much time did you spend on your
phone? Like responding to people,
posting, like just screen time,
&gt;&gt; 10 minutes.
&gt;&gt; We made $220 an hour today. And if you
were to do that 40 hours a week, that
would be $440,000 a year.
&gt;&gt; Between the two listings, we got
probably 25 inquiries. At least five of
them were serious. We're doing a washer
install today and a dryer install, and
both of them would like to get rid of
their washer and dryer. So, we could get
another free washer and dryer, fix them
up for like 30 bucks, and rerent them
out. And the economics on that is even
way better than buying them. That's 350
in a week in recurring revenue. That
means at the end of the month, you're
going to have $1,200 to $1,500 in
recurring revenue [music] month one.
&gt;&gt; That means if you do that for one year,
you've got $18,000 in monthly recurring
revenue after a year.
&gt;&gt; Very possible. [music] Remember that one
time last summer when I flew to Utah,
met this guy named Kyler? 22 years old,
zero employees, 5 hours per week, making
$10,000 a month on appliance rentals on
Facebook Marketplace. That's a mouthful.
Well, guess what? After that video went
viral, [music] everyone in the comments
said all these things saying, "Now it's

[01:00]
said all these things saying, "Now it's
oversaturated. I went to Facebook
Marketplace. Too many people are doing
this. What do you do when people steal
the units?" Everyone wanted to know
that. I said, "Kyler, let's put the
haters to bed. I want you to fly to
Texas." He'd never been to Texas before.
Come to my house. Show us how to launch
this business from scratch in one of the
most oversaturated markets in the
country. So, Kyler, you're here in
Texas. We're going to go do this. What
do you think?
&gt;&gt; Let's go fetch and do Be sure to stick
around until the end because Kyler is
going to pull out his phone, share his
screen, and show you exactly how you can
stand out from the competition in any
crowded market. And he's going to show
you how to find the absolute cheapest
washerdryer sets on Facebook
Marketplace. Stay tuned. [music]
All right, look at this. We got the
master in his natural environment. Look
at the confidence in his gate. When
Kyler sees garage sale, he sees dollar
signs. He sees financial freedom. He
sees passive income.
&gt;&gt; Hello.
&gt;&gt; Hi. How's it going?
&gt;&gt; Good. How are you guys?
&gt;&gt; Good. We were interested in the washer
and dryer. Is it still available?

[02:00]
and dryer. Is it still available?
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Can we go take a look at them?
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; And are you guys firm at the 175?
&gt;&gt; So, I like this.
&gt;&gt; Oh, 125.
&gt;&gt; I'll have to look what I [music] think.
I'm pretty sure
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. That's awesome.
&gt;&gt; You're You're right. I think it's 125.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Well, the washer and dryer is it's 125,
right? For both.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Okay, [music] sounds good. I'm going to
take one more look at them. All right.
So, this guy weighs about 73 lbs.
Soaking wet. And look at him. [music]
All by his lonesome. I can't help him
because I'm a YouTuber.
This is an appliance rentals wet dream.
We got these things for 125. We can rent
the dryer itself [music] for 40 bucks,
the washer for 40 bucks. You're
profitable after the second month. Or
you could sell the washer. This thing
would be free. You could make income.
So, there's a tip for you. go to
Facebook Marketplace and find people
advertising garage sales because that
means they didn't want to list
individually all the items they have.
So, we could go list this right now,
leave it in the [music] truck, $400 for
the set, and we could have it sold by
the time we even take it out of the

[03:01]
the time we even take it out of the
truck. See, here's the funny thing about
competition. If you look at it the right
way, you really can't lose. A year ago,
Kyler had no competition. He was the
only guy in town slanging washerdryer
rentals on Facebook Marketplace in the
Salt Lake Ormbo area. today. He's got a
ton of competitors, but guess what? This
is a rising tide situation. It is a grow
the pie situation. That last video
that'll end up getting who knows how
many millions of views increased the
size of this market. It increased the
awareness that renting washers and
dryers is even a thing. Before Kyler was
born on this big blue earth, people
thought that you either had to buy a
washer and dryer and maintain them and
move them and go through all that
headache or you had to go to the
laundromat, lug all your clothes to and
from. Kyler taught us that there's a
third option. Now, because of the
YouTube video, millions of people know
about this third option. Not just
potential competitors, but potential
customers as well. Is this a banger
video or what, guys? Come on. Come on.
Is this a banger video or what?
&gt;&gt; It is.
&gt;&gt; Listen, please hit subscribe on this
channel. You know what? This guy has his
own channel right now, too, right?
&gt;&gt; Yes. Kyler V Creator.
&gt;&gt; He's tagged below. Go subscribe to him,

[04:01]
&gt;&gt; He's tagged below. Go subscribe to him,
too.
&gt;&gt; All righty. While we were in the garage
sale, I got three notifications.
Jonathan said that this is still pending
pickup. Tachi says she's she's wondering
if it's still interested. We'll get back
to her. Shenen, hello. I'm interested in
a washer and dryer set for 12 months.
Are you available to install one this
Friday? 12 months, $60 a month. That's
$720
for the year. She'll probably rent it
for at least 2 years. And we just got a
set for 125 bucks. So, you can make $600
profit just from Chaen per year.
&gt;&gt; And let's just do this. Look at my
watch. Look at that. You see that 11
right there? It is September 11th. Rest
in peace. I want people to see just that
we're not faking this. Oops. All right.
&gt;&gt; This is one that we boosted.
&gt;&gt; Finishes in 23 hours. So, we boosted it
an hour ago.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; Right. Ends. It's a 1-day boost. What's
the logic and how much money did you put
behind the boost?
&gt;&gt; $20.
&gt;&gt; And tell me the logic behind that in
like a crowded market.
&gt;&gt; All right. Think about it, guys. If the
cost $20 to acquire a customer, which we
already did in the first hour, we'll get
at least three more probably. We just

[05:01]
at least three more probably. We just
got a set for $120, so we're 125. So,
we're all in for$145. And the lifetime
value of just shaane is over $700, most
likely $1,400. And it cost her tw it
cost $20 to get her. Less than $20.
&gt;&gt; Doesn't your average customer stay for
more than just one year?
&gt;&gt; At least at least two years.
&gt;&gt; So that's not lifetime value, that's
yearly value, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So let's say [clears throat] so it's 600
profit the first year, but 720 profit
the second year.
&gt;&gt; Correct.
&gt;&gt; Let's say the app just conservatively,
two years, right? We're looking at
$1,300
profit lifetime value per customer. And
for those out there that are watching
like, "Oh, this is too crowded. This too
competitive. I open Facebook Marketplace
and everyone's stop." Like, how greedy
do you have to be? $20 to acquire
$1,300.
$20 to acquire $1,300 in a crowded
competitive market. DFW is one of the
most competitive markets. So, I don't
care if you're at Huntsville, Alabama or
in Utah, Dallas Worth. I'm so sorry

[06:02]
in Utah, Dallas Worth. I'm so sorry
because of our last video, people have
to spend $20 now to acquire a $1,300
customer instead of spending $0. Darn.
While I'm ranting, let me rant a little
more. So, initially, I thought, all
right, you don't have a truck, no
problem. Go to Home Depot. Trucks are 29
bucks. Then you pay a mileage fee. That
adds up, especially in markets like
Dallas Fort Worth. That's super spread
out. So, what we did was pretty genius.
We went to Hertz $161 and it is $29.99
per day rental rate 5 days no mileage
charge. Okay, we would have paid this
easily [music] in one day if renting
this from Home Depot or U-Haul because
of their like 75 cents per mile charge.
And then like you feel limited on like,
oh, we can't go there cuz it's 75 cents
a mile. Just go to freaking Hertz, Avis,
National, I don't care. Rent a truck and
you'll pay 30 bucks a day with no
mileage charge. And then of course you
do that just to prove the demand. It's
not reasonable to do that forever. Prove
the demand, get some rentals, and then
go lease uh or buy a cheap truck.

[07:01]
go lease uh or buy a cheap truck.
Anything with a bed in it. All righty,
guys. We forgot the one thing we needed,
which is channel lock. So, we're going
to make a quick pit stop at Lowe's and
go pick them up.
This is what we're going for. 15 bucks.
[music] All right. I'm going to get some
hoses as well, just cuz I don't want the
old ones to leak and someone messages
me.
&gt;&gt; All right. Uh Kyler, tell us [music]
about these. Are these worth uh worth
buying?
&gt;&gt; We're looking for the lowest the
cheapest. Okay. Like this is going to be
your cheapest one, but we don't love a
mana. It's just like a little bit cheap.
Anything that says Samsung on it, do not
buy. Samsung is garbage.
&gt;&gt; Sorry, Android users. [music]
&gt;&gt; Tell me your thought process here.
Typically, yeah. You don't use the old
hoses just because the gasket could be
uh worn out and then it [music] could
leak.
&gt;&gt; Are you using new hoses for all of your
installs?
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Is there a source online where you can
get those for cheaper or in bulk?

[08:00]
get those for cheaper or in bulk?
&gt;&gt; maronee.com. Fetch. Okay. We're going to
spend the money. We're going to get the
bougie metal connectors, everybody.
[music] All right, let's get out of
here.
&gt;&gt; All right. So, what's the address?
&gt;&gt; 4815.
I think we've been bamboozled. Chris,
&gt;&gt; what are you talking about?
&gt;&gt; I mean, I'm just not seeing an apartment
unit. You don't have like a unit number?
&gt;&gt; I don't have a unit number. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. So, we don't have a unit
number and he's ghosting us, but he did
show interest. You're telling me there's
a chance. What do we do [music] at this
point?
&gt;&gt; I think we just start knocking doors. I
mean, there's only like 200. I can run
around and find him. I'm going to say we
are here and I'll start spamming him.
Hopefully, he he picks up.
&gt;&gt; I don't know if you guys got this, but
our customer is ghosting us and we're at
his apartment and we don't have a unit
number. So, we're going to start
knocking. When these customers are worth
700 bucks a year and they stay around
for 2 to three years on average, it's
worth an hour of knocking.
&gt;&gt; This guys is, by the way, why I normally
get a phone number. Dilling just on
Messenger, terrible idea. Always get a
phone number before you deliver.
&gt;&gt; And you know what? While we're here,
there's a pretty good chance we never

[09:00]
there's a pretty good chance we never
find this will he continue to ghost us.
So, we might as well try to sling some
washer guards to these guys, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, by the way, even if this is a
quote unquote failed attempt, we now
know this whole entire complex don't
have washers and dryers and they have
hookups.
&gt;&gt; That's a data point. That's a data
point.
&gt;&gt; One data point.
&gt;&gt; Two dots equal a line.
&gt;&gt; A few moments later,
&gt;&gt; he has seen it.
&gt;&gt; Oh. Oh. Oh. Sorry. 106.
&gt;&gt; Boom.
&gt;&gt; Let's go. We're freaking rich.
&gt;&gt; He said by the pool.
&gt;&gt; Look, this is such a good lesson. We had
to drive here even after he was ghosting
us. We could have said, "You know what?
It's not worth the drive. He's ghosting
us. I guarantee you if he doesn't follow
up like seven times like an obsessive
girlfriend, he's not going to respond.
You got to follow up. If you don't feel
like you're stalking them, then you
haven't followed up enough. I don't care
if you're selling enterprise software,
turtles, whatever. What's up, Will?
&gt;&gt; Hey,
&gt;&gt; how's it going?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. How are you?
&gt;&gt; Good.
&gt;&gt; That's the parent.
&gt;&gt; Uh we'll park our car somewhere closer

[10:00]
&gt;&gt; Uh we'll park our car somewhere closer
and then we'll start bringing up the
other one. I don't know if we can take
this one with us just because I don't
know if we have the room. But either
way, we can get it out of we can either
put it down here or or wherever if
that's all right. In theory, we're doing
a washer install today and a dryer
install and both of them would like to
get rid of their washer and dryer. So,
we could get another free washer and
dryer, fix them up for like 30 bucks and
rerent them out. And the economics on
that is even way better than buying
them.
&gt;&gt; Or we could sell them. We could we could
fix them and flip them.
&gt;&gt; We could sell them, put all that cash
into boosted Facebook marketplace posts,
&gt;&gt; get some more clients. Amen. The hoses
he has in his house look several years
old. And if this gasket wears out,
that's going to be the first thing to
fail and you'll get a call for a leaky
uh washer. So, every time I do an
install, I make sure I put new hoses
with new gaskets. That way, I don't have
to worry about flooding and uh just
cover myself there. So, we're going to
put in some new hoses for him. And
should take a couple minutes, then we'll
be out of there.

[11:02]
&gt;&gt; [music]
&gt;&gt; I hope it I got some brand new hoses for
it and it should be working good. If it
does shake at all, just put a little bit
of cardboard under this foot so it's a
little bit more level.
&gt;&gt; Thank you guys.
&gt;&gt; No problem. Yep. So, how often do people
want to only rent one of the two units?
&gt;&gt; Um, it's not super often, but I always
do it because the math on it makes more
sense. Cuz if I do it as single, I still
rent it for more than just half price,
if that makes sense.
&gt;&gt; And three times when their dryer breaks,
they'll be calling me to rent them the
dryer. So, it's just a contact and uh
yeah, they'll they'll keep renting.
&gt;&gt; So, did that go pretty smoothly based on
how jobs normally go?
&gt;&gt; Uh, yeah. I mean, we were in and out in
probably 20 minutes or less. Um, their
water valve was leaking, but I make it
very clear that I have nothing to do

[12:00]
very clear that I have nothing to do
with their water. I'm in charge of the
washer, and so they're going to have to
call their maintenance team and get that
checked out. But we tested the washer,
the hot water was working, and
everything looks looks to be good.
&gt;&gt; On to the next.
&gt;&gt; Here's the thing about appliance rental
businesses like these or any business,
you shouldn't do it alone. If you want
to go fast, go alone. If you want to go
far, go together. So check out
tkowners.com where me plus 500 other
entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs are
building businesses just like this
appliance rental business. In fact,
several of them are building that exact
business. Come join us and you will have
a lot more help. All righty. So this is
the apartment complex we just delivered
it to. I didn't count, but I would
assume there's between 16 units in each
building. We got 16 * 16. There's at
least 256 apartments there that don't
have washers and dryers, but they do
have the hookups. If you rented them for
$60 a month, that apartment complex
alone could be $15,000 in recurring
revenue each month. Talk to the property
manager, get their information, start
slinging door hangers. That's a gold

[13:01]
slinging door hangers. That's a gold
mine. All right, I'm going to text our
girl, let her know that we're on our way
so we don't end up searching for an
apartment complex again. We'll probably
work like maybe 4 hours, 5 hours today
with on this business. Maybe four. With
all the drive time and everything, we're
going to create at least $70 in monthly
recurring revenue. It's not crazy,
right? But let's do some math. If you
did that five days a week, which is
definitely possible, there's there was
hundreds of deals.
&gt;&gt; Do the same math
&gt;&gt; on Facebook Marketplace. That's $7 a day
in recurring revenue. Let's say you just
work 5 days a week
&gt;&gt; and [music] you still have your
full-time job
&gt;&gt; and you still have another job.
&gt;&gt; You're at work kind of posting on
Facebook Marketplace, casually [music]
responding to people, and then you do
the deliveries in the evening.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And you could honestly do more
than this. And you could do sets. So,
we've had at least three or four people
that actually want a real set, but too
far away, whatever. 30 minutes away, 45
minutes away.
&gt;&gt; We're [music] being picky.
&gt;&gt; We're being picky. $70 in recurring
revenue a day. You do that five times,
that's 350 in a week in recurring
revenue. That's the difference, right?
That means at the end of the month,
you're going to have $1,200 to $1,500 in

[14:01]
you're going to have $1,200 to $1,500 in
recurring revenue. Revenue month [music]
one.
&gt;&gt; That means if you do that for one year,
you've got $18,000 in monthly recurring
revenue after a year. very possible
there's not going to be the bottleneck
will never be [music] demand of people
wanting to do it. It will always be your
time and your your work ethic.
&gt;&gt; So if you're willing to not even quit
your job [music] but do this on the side
weekends you could how many how many
could you do on the weekend?
&gt;&gt; You could do three or four on the
weekend
&gt;&gt; in a normal day if you had the machines
and you had it planned out. The most
I've ever done in a day was like four or
five.
&gt;&gt; Let's say you do seven a week. 7* 70 a
month. that 4.5 weeks in a month. That
much in monthly recurring revenue. You
do that for a year straight. $26,000 a
month in predictable, reliable monthly
recurring revenue.
&gt;&gt; There's nothing sexy about it other than
that. I'm going to give her a call just
cuz she hasn't responded yet and I don't
want to drive 30 minutes out of the way.
&gt;&gt; Hello.
&gt;&gt; Hi, this is Kyler. How's it going?
&gt;&gt; Good.
&gt;&gt; I just wanted to make sure that you uh
we're going to we're on our way and

[15:00]
we're going to we're on our way and
we'll be there in about 25 minutes. Are
we still good to deliver that dryer?
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; All righty. Sounds good. We will be
knocking on your door in about 25
minutes.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; All right. It sounds good. See you
later.
&gt;&gt; Okay. See you.
&gt;&gt; Bye.
&gt;&gt; All right. Bye.
&gt;&gt; All right. We are in Rowlette, Texas.
Home of the 2015 tornado.
&gt;&gt; They are still recovering 10 years
later. [music] It's what most people
only talk about the tornadoes still.
&gt;&gt; All right. This is a nice neighborhood.
&gt;&gt; Very nice.
&gt;&gt; These are half million dollar homes.
How's it going?
&gt;&gt; Good.
&gt;&gt; Nice to meet you. I'm Kyler.
&gt;&gt; Hi, I'm Miranda.
&gt;&gt; Chris.
&gt;&gt; Miranda. Will you show us the laundry
room?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure.
&gt;&gt; Oh, perfect. All righty. We'll start
moving it in. Okay.
[music]
&gt;&gt; [music]

[16:03]
[music]
&gt;&gt; Will you remind me your name?
&gt;&gt; Miranda. We're going to play a little
game. Okay. If you guess the number 1
through 10 right, then it'll be
completely free. There will be no
payment today and no payment ever. It'll
just be your your dryer. So, you you
have a 1 in 10 chance to get it right.
[music] And he's filming it. So he has
the number and everything. 1 through 10.
What are you filling?
&gt;&gt; Eight.
&gt;&gt; That's eight.
&gt;&gt; You won.
&gt;&gt; It's all yours.
&gt;&gt; That washer or that dryer is yours. So
no payment. It's free. And uh yeah, it's
just yours.
&gt;&gt; All right, Kyler, break down what just
happened in there. All
&gt;&gt; righty. That was a perfect example of a
smooth install. We had the right plug
already. I already knew that going into
it. All we had to do with the dryer is
plug it in. make sure the vent was
hooked up and we got out of there, make
sure it was balanced. I tested it and it

[17:00]
sure it was balanced. I tested it and it
was heating. Make sure they know how to
change the lint trap and uh in theory
that would have been uh $35 to $40 a
month.
&gt;&gt; And what's very interesting is we asked
her what made her think to rent an
appliance on Facebook Marketplace,
&gt;&gt; of course.
&gt;&gt; And I'm glad I got more specific cuz she
wasn't very specific, but I asked her,
did you go on Facebook Marketplace just
looking to buy one? And then you saw an
ad for rent and then you realized, I got
to get a truck. I got to organize all
this. and she thought, I might as well
rent one. Right.
&gt;&gt; Exactly.
&gt;&gt; So, that's a perfect example of someone
in any local market. They're like, ah,
it's too crowded. It's too competitive.
I open Facebook Marketplace, there's 20
other listings. That grows the pie. That
increases the awareness, right? Because
you said there's like 60 listings in DFW
right now
&gt;&gt; at least. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Let's say before our last video, there
were 10. Right now, there's six times as
much visibility on washerdryer for rent
on Facebook Marketplace. people that
aren't looking for it, they see it, they
realize it's a thing, and then they
become a customer.
&gt;&gt; And it's all about if you want to win
all of those clients, just respond
because once they realize it's a thing,
they're going to just find the first
person who will deliver it. And because

[18:01]
person who will deliver it. And because
all the pricing is a roughly the same.
So it's the first person who will
communicate and deliver and is honest.
&gt;&gt; And I'll also say if you're boosting
your post, more eyeballs equals more
money. More visibility equals more
money. So if your normal price is 70
bucks a month, boost it and charge 85.
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah,
&gt;&gt; why not?
&gt;&gt; All righty. Ever since Chris launched
this video, I have over five people that
have 20 sets rented out. It's not too
saturated. If you guys want help, all
the guys contracts, live calls with me.
Check the link down below. So, ever
since me and Chris launched the video,
we've gotten about 800,000 views. So,
I'm going to check the Dallas Fort Worth
area and see how much competition we've
[music] got. So, the first thing that I
need to do is uh change my location on
Facebook. And let's go to edit. [music]
Drag it over to Plano, Texas.
&gt;&gt; [music]
&gt;&gt; Let's go 30 miles
and then type in washer [music] and
dryer for rent. All righty. One day ago
$60 a month free delivery and install
free repairs. 6 month minimum one.

[19:02]
free repairs. 6 month minimum one.
Washer and dryer for [music] rent. Two.
Three. Four.
[music] There's like 50. [laughter]
Should I? Okay, I'm going to restart
that. But I'll just keep scrolling.
[music]
All righty. So, we got one one over
here. $65 washer and dryer for rent, $50
washer and dryer for rent. And they
pretty much all have the [music] same
exact description that I posted in the
original YouTube video, free delivery,
install, and maintenance. [music]
So, as you can see, there's a lot of
listings here in the Dallas Fort Worth
area. The YouTube video has some some
crazy reach. And the goal of today is to
show you that even though the market
[music] is quote unquote saturated, that
there's still a great opportunity to
make money. Yeah. So, let's make that
listing right now. [music] So, go to
marketplace, go over to your listings,
create a new listing. So, we're going to
add some photos. Go to washer and dryer.
All righty. We are going to use this
photo that's [music] super clear

[20:02]
photo that's [music] super clear
outside. Good lighting. For the title,
we'll just put washer and dryer. For
[music] rent, there was quite a few of
the listings were above $60 between 70
and 85. So, we were going to keep ours
on the lower end at $60. [music] Make
sure the category says washer and dryer
sets. Condition, we'll do used like new.
for [music] the description.
[music] Uh, I'm not in any groups here
in Dallas, but it would be a great idea
to join [music] some local buy and sell
groups in Dallas, and that would be
another thing that could set me apart.
But for now, we'll just post and see
what happens there. So, we'll just
publish that. And another [music] big
thing that you can do to separate
yourself from the others is after this
gets approved, you can boost the post
for $1 to $2 a day, which isn't very
much money, but it'll put your listing
to the top [music] of the marketplace
results when people type in washer and
dryer. So, we'll just wait for this to
get approved and uh see what happens.

[21:01]
get approved and uh see what happens.
All righty, guys. Our Facebook
marketplace uh listing [music] is
pending right now. So, we are going to
search marketplace now for a washer and
dryer set that we are going to purchase
[music] and rent out. Once again, we
first publish the listing, wait for a
client, and then we will buy the washer
and dryer set. But it's going to be nice
to just [music] have an idea of what the
local price range is. Um, so we're going
to go back to marketplace
and then just type in washer [music] and
dryer. Um, ideally, we'll get this set
for Oh, here we go. Our listing got
published. So, ideally, we're [music]
going to be looking for a washer and
dryer in the $100 to $200 range, and it
will be a direct drive if we can get
what we want. Um, [music] I'm going to
kind of show you what I I look for. So,
this first one's $200. This looks
[music] like a clean set. It has an
agitator. We like that. It was posted 44
minutes ago. [music] It says washer
makes noise when spinning. Uh, that's
probably a bearing issue, so skip that
one. We're getting a lot of machines for

[22:00]
one. We're getting a lot of machines for
[music] rent, which is good for good for
us, but not right now because we're
looking to [music] buy one.
We got this $300 one. [music] Um, that's
the exact type of set we're looking for
that it's direct drive. So, we're going
to save that. And [music] if all else
fails, we will get this set. But, we
should be able to get one for a little
bit cheaper. [music] and looks like it's
actually in a store, so it may come with
a warranty as well. This is another good
set. Everything works [music] well,
working condition. It's only $200, but
if you zoom in on this picture, you can
see [music]
that there's a control board. There's
six little lights there. So, that is not
a direct drive washer, but it is $100
cheaper [music] than the other set. So,
we'll keep looking.
[music]
All righty. We'll actually make an offer

[23:00]
All righty. We'll actually make an offer
here. It [music] says, "Washer and dryer
set, make an offer. Need it gone.
Matching set. Dryer may need some
screws." I'm not exactly sure what
[music] that means, but we can get some
screws if we need it. It's $150. So, we
will send a message to them and we'll go
back up and send a [music] message to
the $300 one cuz it's 50 bucks cheaper
than all the other ones we were seeing.
And we will try to get one of those
sets. So, that's kind of what I look for
when I scroll through Facebook
Marketplace. I'm just looking for the
older sets, something that offers a
warranty [music] and something that
looks clean that I do not have to touch.
All righty. So, we've sent about five to
six messages. So now I'm going to go
back to my messenger and I'm just going
to let everyone know that I'm very
interested [music] and I can pick it up
today. And that will just show them that
I'm a real person and I'm ready to do
it.
&gt;&gt; All right. So you landed in Dallas a
couple days ago. You immediately went to
Facebook Marketplace. You saw there were
60 competitive listings, which is a lot
for any market. And then you just went
to work at starting this business from
scratch. We didn't get a name. We didn't

[24:01]
scratch. We didn't get a name. We didn't
get a logo, website, LLC, insurance. We
forgot all of that. We didn't forget. We
skipped all of that on purpose. and you
just started posting to Facebook
Marketplace. What happened?
&gt;&gt; Surprisingly, I mean, we boosted one
listing, but between the two listings,
we got probably 25 inquiries. At least
five of them were serious. And uh same
day delivery, and we already rented out
two sets for a total of $70 a month. And
we did that in about 3 hours.
&gt;&gt; How much time did you spend on your
phone? Like responding to people,
posting, like just screen time,
&gt;&gt; 10 minutes.
&gt;&gt; How much time did we spend going to that
garage sale, picking up the sets,
delivering them to two different houses
on opposite sides of the metroplex? I
mean, we left your house at 12:30. We
were done with the last one by 3:30. So,
all in all, two hours.
&gt;&gt; 12:30 to 3:30. That's three hours plus.
We're going to say four hours of working
on this business.
&gt;&gt; Edit that out so my math looks good.
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; Four hours of work. What is our revenue
today?
&gt;&gt; Today, $70.
&gt;&gt; $70. Okay. So, if we just stop there,
$17.50 per hour labor
&gt;&gt; above minimum wage.

[25:00]
&gt;&gt; above minimum wage.
&gt;&gt; Above minimum wage. Now, theoretically,
we shouldn't need to service those. We
shouldn't like let's say they last for a
year. That's $840 of revenue from four
hours of work.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's 220 bucks or so.
&gt;&gt; And we got two set both of the
deliveries we did, they both wanted to
give us their washer and dryer. So
technically, we have two more machines
that we could rent out for for free.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So even if all of your customers
only stay for a year, we made $220 an
hour today. And if you were to do that
40 hours a week, that would be $440,000
a year of net profit. Of course, there's
going to be insurance. There's going to
be gas, but it's not going to cut it
down that much because we delivered the
thing once, right? How many times have
you gotten one stolen of all the units
you've ever rented out?
&gt;&gt; Uh, one time.
&gt;&gt; One time.
&gt;&gt; 1%.
&gt;&gt; is the industry. Someone called the rent
to center errands and uh they said their
average actual loss rate is 1%. 1 to 2%.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; That they consider a loss.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, for every $70 a month rental
you make, you need to budget.70 cents

[26:01]
you make, you need to budget.70 cents
per month in theft shrinkage.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, for all those comments, it's
like, what happens when they you lose.7
cents a month. I would just like to
remind everyone he started this business
when he was 22. He has no college
degree. He has no employees. He spends
five hours a week on it. And I don't say
that disparagingly, okay? He would be
stupid to get a college degree. No
offense to people like me that have
college degrees for sure. Okay? He knows
better. So you're the man color.
