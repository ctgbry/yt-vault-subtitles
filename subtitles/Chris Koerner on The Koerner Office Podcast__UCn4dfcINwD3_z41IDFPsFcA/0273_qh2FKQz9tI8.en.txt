I just found a home service business
that has way more demand than Supply
there's only one competitor per million
residents and you don't need any money
to start just a way to get yourself
around town 70% of Americans own a grill
and those grills need to be cleaned most
people won't pay someone 250 bucks to
clean their Grill but 10% Will the
Market size in DFW is $60 million that
means that if each of the eight
companies have an equal share of the
market it's an $8 million business for
each of them look how much these guys
are charging for a grill cleaning I'm
calling them and they won't even pick up
their phone they're too busy here's how
you scale this business Angie's List
thumb teac Google LSA Facebook groups
and Facebook Marketplace those are five
lead generation sources throw in direct
mail while you're at it takes about 2
hours to perform a job you can charge
$250 to $300 on average and you will
have 40% net profit margins I got a ton
