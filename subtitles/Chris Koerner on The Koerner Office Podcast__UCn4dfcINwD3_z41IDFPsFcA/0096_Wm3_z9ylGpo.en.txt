[00:00]
thank you Nick for joining so Nick is a
little different in that he didn't
really come to me with a question he
just emailed me about what he's doing
and he's buying book and music royalties
and I thought that sounds really cool
let why and we just wrote down about
that for a few minutes on my show and he
said great so welcome Nick to the ker
office thanks for having me Chris I big
fan and yeah excited to chat about some
interesting Investments today all right
me too thank you by the way and tell me
approximately how many deals you've
invested in so far let's see probably
done about 10 or so and then
hold about six or seven well personally
in between we have small little friends
and family investment fund okay and then
what dollar amount are you investing in
each of these on average these could
depend from you know as low as 20 grand
up to you 1002 200 Grand overall okay so
I should probably back up and I'll let
everyone know we were already talking
and I forgot to record so I'm going to

[01:01]
and I forgot to record so I'm going to
ask Nick to uh repeat a couple things so
just tell us briefly what the thesis is
with investing in book and music
royalties why do you like it compared to
more traditional things like the stock
market or real estate and what are your
goals moving forward with it totally I
like it because it's weird and a lot of
people don't do it and I like obscure uh
Investments but more specifically it's
uncorrelated returns so stock market
goes down you might cancel Your Country
Club but you're probably going to keep
your $10 a month Spotify playlist the
yields are pretty attractive it's
protected in the sense of it's
intellectual property so you get revenue
for the life of the author plus 70 years
and a lot of these songs have really
good staying power if you buy them some
adverti tax benefits and then the
industry as a whole there's a lot of
pressure in support of artists getting
paid rather than some of these big
Universal warant companies so there's a

[02:01]
Universal warant companies so there's a
lot of kind of upward pressure and we're
buying those same rights from a
songwriter or producer and yeah the it's
not very volatile it's not very crazy
pretty similar to corporate bond in
terms of kind of the risk structure yeah
what would you say the annual yield is
on your 10 Investments on average and
what's like the best and the worst we
are doing low double digits it's fairly
stable growing slightly I I think on
kind of the the group money that we have
were about like 12% a year okay and then
what's the best and worst out of that
Bunch yeah the best is the I bought a
book asset off for book royalty off of
Craigslist like 10 years ago so I bought
that for 35 Grand and it was paying 12
Grand then and that's doing 16,000 a
month or excuse me 16,000 a year I wish
it was a month currently so that's my
best performance former okay that's

[03:01]
best performance former okay that's
probably like the best opener of any
party story I've ever heard yeah I
bought this book royalty off Craigslist
for 35 Grand ones so you paid 35 Grand
and it's paying you 16 Grand a year
today currently yep and did you you just
randomly found it on Craigslist or how
were you how did you find this yeah I
was few years into my career I bought 1%
down condo and then remodeled it myself
got a 90 grand helck and I was like I
need to deploy this Capital as quick as
possible and my other buddy who I do
this with he's a CFA one of kind of
better analysts in this space worked at
royalty exchange which is where an eBay
for these things music royalties and
book royalties are cool Investments so I
posted on Craigslist buying oil and gas
royalties music royalties I guess so
that's the post and I just kept posting
that and this guy reached out to me and
he said hey I'm moving to Alaska to go
fly planes and fly fish and I used to be
a literary agent and I want to sell you
this thing

[04:00]
this thing
I was like all right and he gave me
about 120 pounds of paper of for due
diligence I didn't really know what I
was doing but got some upwork attorneys
and figured it out and wrote them the
check that was it you are my kind of guy
man like I swear you're the same this is
totally something I would do holy cow
okay what year was this let's see maybe
2016 okay so you're just having this
one-off conversation with with a friend
and he's you've got 90 grand to put into
something and you've got this sense of
urgency cuz it's burning a hole in your
pocket and coincidentally your friend
says look at royalties so you go to
Craigslist and you post in the looking
for royalty section which should exist
apparently and this guy wants to move to
Alaska and he wrote a book then no so he
was the agent for a best-selling author
so that author still puts out it's CJ
box so he does Western kind of crime
books and he puts a new book in the same
series out there's been a few TV series

[05:01]
series out there's been a few TV series
yeah good good books but he had an
interest in the first six because he was
the first agent and then that author has
moved on to a new agent okay so now so
for these first six books yep the
original author gets nothing for them
correct the author gets a considerably
larger CH the agent the literary the
first agent yep had a 7.5% interest in
the net income of the books and so he
sold that 7 and a half% interest to me
so he doesn't receive anything he got
his check and he's fly fishing and
flying around in a plane which sounds
awesome okay all right all right sorry
so he just needed to get liquid so he
could go fly some planes and
he what do you think the gamble was that
he took like that this these first six
books were past their prime or did he
just really need money and he wasn't
even taking a Gamble and he knew he was
selling something pretty good I think he

[06:00]
selling something pretty good I think he
knew he was selling something pretty
good it's obscure in the sense of
there's not anywhere to go buy these
things especially for a book that's
music trades fairly regularly books I
don't know where I would go sell that if
I needed to and he I guess it's all
checks there's no direct deposit for
this book stuff so he's like where I'm
going there is no mail and I would have
to fly hundreds of miles to go get the
mail and deposit the check
so that was his main
issue you lucked out so you lucked out
in a sense you did because the fact that
Logistics even played a role in this is
so funny like how many places can one
move to where there's no mail you know I
don't know yeah I got an incredible deal
and I had no clue and it was scary for
me because I'd never written a $35,000
check yeah you know in my life so I'm
like can I buy this is this actually
something that you can purchase

[07:00]
something that you can purchase
yeah so yeah it all worked out and it's
still growing so I'm stoked on it
at geez so at the time that you bought
this what was he receiving per month
what did you think the ROI was on day
one first and I think you told me this
in the beginning but I can't remember
first what it is today it was so it pays
twice a year it was paying roughly
$122,000 a year back then so I knew I
was getting at a three times multiple
okay so like 3x multiple okay perfect
man you can go to Omaha Nebraska and buy
an HVAC business for a 3X multiple and
then start driving all over town
swapping out condensers or you can post
to Craigslist and send a stranger 35
Grand and hope and pray that you get a
passive 3x M this literally is passive
right like quote there's no such thing
as passive income but could you get more
passive than this I do nothing so no I
don't think that's
[Applause]
possible wow okay so this kind of wet

[08:00]
possible wow okay so this kind of wet
your appetite and you're like why even
invest in other things if this exists
yeah more realistically everything else
you buy in this space is not as good as
the first one so stuff we're buying now
a really attractive price might be five
six seven times multiple and for really
high quality things you're paying closer
to 8 nine 10 so it's still attractive
returns but this isn't the go buy a
business at three and see 40 50% IR or
whatever now what was the worst one that
you've done so far and do you think
there's a chance it could turn around
yeah we haven't boughten anything that's
there's a ton of junk out there so you
go on royalty exchange like most of the
stuff's junk so there's a big Decay
curve and you got to look at is this
recurring revenue from Spotify so you
buy something that's old and stabilized
you know it's in someone's Spotify
playlist they listen to it once a week

[09:01]
playlist they listen to it once a week
or whatever and then it's pretty
consistent so we haven't had anything
that's like a clear loser we've had
stuff that has pretty much been flat or
slightly growing and our due diligence
process has been pretty good to pick out
stuff that does what we expected to um
okay and is royalty exchange the deao
place you shop for these nowadays no we
go through Brokers we look on royalty
exchange just because there's a lot of
deal flow there but stuff tends to be
more expensive than we can get it off
Market which off Market is different in
that sense yeah do you think there's an
a business opportunity here for someone
to create a more streamlined Marketplace
or surely you've thought of
opportunities to make this industry more
efficient yeah from an efficiency play
it would
be do there's a lot of companies that
have tried that and I think the biggest
thing the challenge is the actual deal
flow and transacting these because once
you say we got a deal you have to

[10:01]
you say we got a deal you have to
go say hey I've got one and a half%
interest in this song from a producer
side and then a songwriter side and then
none of this stuff was ever made to
change hands so then you go to Warner
and it can be like a multi-month process
to just say hey the ownership has
changed so yeah there's some models out
there of crowd vesting and exchanges I
don't know what I would do I would
probably just raise a bunch of money and
then go allocate it and go with a fund
model I feel do you ever study the Lindy
effect or think about that are you
familiar with the the Lindy effect give
me the so the Lindy effect is basically
the the principle that however long
something has been around is as likely
as it's going to be around in the future
so if you buy an HVAC business in Omaha
that's been around for 50 years
statistically speaking it will be around
for at least another 50 years okay sure
which two month a two-month old startup
stati basically has two more months

[11:00]
stati basically has two more months
right cool so I think of it like this
where if you're buying Bob Dylan that's
a pretty safe bet which means you're
probably going to get a lower return but
if you're buying some guy that went
viral on Tik Tok it's a gamble right but
it could be a really good gamble he
could be he could be dead of a drug
overdose in in six months or he could be
the next Taylor Swift the the overdose
would probably actually help the income
that's I was thinking that yeah I was
thinking that it's just a gamble you
have to take right just like anything
what do you think helped this six book
deal that you bought what do you think
helped it improve was it a CO like just
a covid phenomenon or did something
happen with the author or is it just you
can't attribute it to anything yeah so
everything we buy a minority interest so
there's someone else who's got a vested
interest in making the songs or the book
successful this author has puts out a
new book every single year in the series
that hits the best seller
and so I have the first six and there's

[12:01]
and so I have the first six and there's
you know 26 books in the series it got
picked up Big Sky was picked up and
turned into a TV show which is one of
the other book series from the same
author and then there was also TV series
called Joe picket which is the name of
these
series um so that got a lot of interest
in it between the new books and the TV
shows that's been a consistent bump up
so that's where I would attribute the
the success the the book deal H is there
a world where you could buy a minority
or a majority interest in these rights
and then have some sort of an in
influence over how well that artist or
author does like maybe you're in the
industry and you're able to affect the
outcome more are people doing that
totally so that's kind of hypnosis the
big one of the biggest investment funds
in the space their pitch is hey we can
pay 15x 16x and we have a whole team of
people who will go out there and try to
place this song or increase its

[13:01]
place this song or increase its
publicity
and that's their strategy and you
probably hasn't worked out as well as
they thought it would at least how the
numbers show but yeah they maybe they
overpaid for Stuff thinking that their
effect would be greater than it actually
ended up being especially if you're
doing it at scale right like you can
only promote so much totally now what do
you think before I hit record we were
talking about soono Y which sunno is
like this AI music generator how do you
think that plays into this at all I'm
sick of hearing people say AI is going
to disrupt this and that and then we
learn actually like people are pretty
important and AI can disrupt a lot but I
think that I look at it like
self-driving cars there's that last 5%
will take as long as the first 95% did
to disrupt so on one hand it's what is
AI going to do to all these rights if
you can replace Taylor Swift with a
click of a button but the other hand
it's h how easy will that be what are
your thoughts on that I'm with you just
like chat GPT now of the quality of

[14:00]
like chat GPT now of the quality of
writing is not there I listen to AO make
AO song and it's fun but I I haven't
listened to Theo songs on my playlist
ever um so I think it's you know night
and day difference between a quality
produced song with someone who's
experienced and good background singers
and good producer versus hey the
computer's going to go make some of the
stuff I think it's wildly powerful but I
think we've got a long time until we see
that's like actually on par with high
quality music today yeah I actually when
I first discovered sunno I couldn't
sleep that night not because ofso but so
I I stayed up I came here in my office
and I pulled out my MacBook and I'm like
all right how can you use this to go
viral on Spotify and I went down this
rabbit hole and I found all these
articles about people that had been
doing this and trying this for months
now and and some with s some success
right there there has been some success
and sunno gives you all the rights like
like you you could make a a hit onso

[15:01]
like you you could make a a hit onso
legally and upload it to Spotify and
make a lot of money on it and I forget
what the roadblocks were
but I don't know I just think we're
still too early like I look at this
phase of AI as like the when I first got
an iPhone the best app was like this
fart noises app oh yeah and I feel like
we're still there in Ai and it's like
fun and it's quirky but then Uber came
along years later and like you harnessed
like the underlying infrastructure of
the iPhone to really change the game it
wasn't just like an app that appeared
useful or funny on the surface it was
like the actual utility in the
technology totally and I feel like
that's what AI is doing like it's the
plumbing of AI is really helping boost
the the capabilities of of companies
large and small and it's leveling the
playing field totally more yeah and
there's probably still those second and
third level of facts out there where you
could you take advantage of AI so maybe
it's not making songs but it's I'm going
to go make ringtones or noises or or
something else that is an opportunity

[16:01]
something else that is an opportunity
for yeah like my newsletter talked about
just getting someone's attention with a
a custom sunno song it it's just like
replacing a quirky subject line of an
email and you're not going to sell them
the song maybe you do you're just using
it to get their attention especially if
it's someone who's over 50 years old and
probably won't know about sunno for
another three or four years it's really
novel and unique to that totally yeah
perfect example to separate yourself get
byy in and exactly like he said if I can
do this imagine what else I can do and
add a ton of value to someone who's out
there doing HVAC every day but would
like more business awesome Nick thank
you for coming if anyone wants to ask
you questions I don't even know if you
want to answer them but if you do want
to answer questions about royalty
investing where can they find you
Twitter you can send them on Twitter my
way happy to talk about it it's fun
stuff yeah okay what's your handle it
