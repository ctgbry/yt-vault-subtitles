Five pallets of toddler t-shirts, 4,300
units. They're selling for 5 each, $200.
That changes everything. No one's paying
attention to it yet. This stuff sells
for nothing. And there's multiple brands
out there that are selling this product
for pennies. Literally, these deals are
up there all the time.
&gt;&gt; This was on the side of the road in
Germany. It's basically a big vending
machine with lost packages.
&gt;&gt; That is amazing. I want some of those.
People would buy that.
&gt;&gt; Oh, all day long. Mystery boxes really
sell. and you're selling an opportunity,
you can track the entire stream of any
auction. You get all the analytics. You
even know who they're selling to. You
get everything. It's just a game
changer, dude. It's amazing.
&gt;&gt; What does this app cost? It's free. How
do you start from scratch on?
&gt;&gt; All right. If you've never heard of
whatnot, you might be living under a
rock. It is the live selling app that
just raised a round of funding at a 12
billion valuation. Live selling is here
to stay. It's not going anywhere. And of
course, Shannon Gene knows all about it.

[01:01]
course, Shannon Gene knows all about it.
So, we talked about how to go from zero
to live selling pro on whatnot and
comparable apps. We also talked about
bin stores, buying Amazon returns,
Costco returns, pennies per item,
putting them in vending machines.
Oh, man. Headache worthy stuff. You're
going to absolutely love this episode.
Please share with a friend.
&gt;&gt; I want to talk about uh lower dollar
items. This is we're looking at the
Hannes um liquidation site and Hannes
makes all kinds of you know everybody
knows probably underwear to sweatshirts
to t-shirts to activew wear all kinds of
stuff and they have this massive
liquidation site. There's like right now
they have a truckload of men's uh
women's hoodies, sweatshirts, joggers.
They say which is a lie that their MSRP
is $442,000.
And you know I always say cut it in
half. So, you know, maybe it's it's 220
grand, which I think that's still too
much. So, let's cut it in half again and
say it's, you know, 100 grand. Right
now, it's the bid is $5,000. So, uh 1%

[02:03]
now, it's the bid is $5,000. So, uh 1%
those 39 cents per unit. Okay.
&gt;&gt; Wow. Because instead of competing with
like we don't really want to price this
against Target, we want to be closer to
like TJ Maxx, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. You know, eBay and whatnot
and you know, all those kinds of places.
Typically, I would steer people away
from this because it's like this deal
here. It's 13,000 pieces, right? It's
massive project. It's it's 24 pallets or
so of this. And I've done this before. I
did it with NFL uh license gear and it
very profitable, but a ton of work to
sort, ship, all that kind of stuff. What
I think changes the game now is the
growth in live selling where you don't
have to take pictures. Number one,
there's two tracks here. You should be
wholesaling this stuff to other sellers
as well. if you buy this product and
it'll sell for like under a dollar.
Okay, it'll it'll be less than a dollar
per item, I'm sure. Um, and I've watched
this each week. So, you should be
finding other retailers that you could
sell it to for $2 an item. People that

[03:00]
sell it to for $2 an item. People that
want to buy it,
&gt;&gt; screen printers, all want to do this or
uh other people that say, "Well, I can't
take a truckload, but I could buy a
pallet, you know." And so, you could you
could you could sell a couple of pallets
of this stuff and get your your original
investment back. Believe it or not, 67%
of the people that watch my YouTube
videos don't subscribe to me and over
90% think that they're subscribed to me.
So, do me a quick favor and check that
you're subscribed to me. If you're not,
please do. It would mean a lot. But live
selling and maybe you're supplying the
live sellers if you don't want to be on
whatnot or Tik Tok shop or Poshmark Live
or eBay Live. It eliminates the prep. It
eliminates having to set this thing out,
take a picture, take 12 pictures, create
a listing, do all that. It takes so much
time.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I've never thought of that. Like
&gt;&gt; the the time you would normally spend to
take pictures and list it on eBay is
just time you're spending live selling
it.
&gt;&gt; You're in front of the camera going,
I've got tw I'm I'm selling boxes of 10.
Here's the here's the hoodie. They're,
you know, we're going to start the bid

[04:00]
you know, we're going to start the bid
at eight bucks. And they just go from
right there. And you watch them. If you
go, you another again, don't watch
Netflix. Watch auctions. Go download the
whatnot app and start watching people
every night and start watching people
sell a pair of shoes every 25 seconds,
every 30 seconds, over and over.
&gt;&gt; Start crunching the numbers on how much
they're making. Boom, boom. Okay, I got
these shoes. Customer turn. Here's a
here's what the shoe looks. They're
holding it up and then it's like boom,
sold. Okay, great. We'll go to the next
one. D. And then the next day, somebody
comes in and there's all this product.
They put it in a you know plastic bag
and out the door it goes. That changes
everything from this kind especially
this kind of product and no one's paying
attention to it yet. It's very cuz this
stuff sells for nothing and there's
multiple brands out there not just
Hannes. This is just the example I'm
using here that are selling this product
for pennies pennies on the do literally
you know like here's five pallets of
toddler t-shirts 3,300 units. They're
selling for five cents each. That's an
opening bid. There's only one bid $200.

[05:01]
opening bid. There's only one bid $200.
it's going to sell for not much more
than that. So that live selling and the
way you start to learn about live
selling. Let me see what else did I Oh
yeah, this is another one that we're
we'll keep talking about live selling
when once you get registered on the
Hannes uh auction liquidation site. And
if you want the link just go to
shanneen.com/auctions
and I'll get you the link. These are men
these are scrubs. Brand new scrubs. I
didn't even know Hannes made made scrubs
but when I logged in today they're like
hey Shannon do you want to buy scrubs?
Of course I do. So you can just make an
offer. There's all these loads 300
pieces men's three pocket vena over over
and over. You get the sizes, you get the
whole thing. You get I don't think
that's a UPC, but it's their model
number or something like that.
&gt;&gt; How many all these loads? 300 300. They
say their retail's 30 bucks. Maybe
they're worth uh $8. So, you can come in
here and just say, "Okay, I'm going to
pay 2% and I'll buy 300." And
&gt;&gt; and 2%'s like an acceptable offer. Like
like that's in the ballpark for what
people accept
&gt;&gt; that kind of stuff. Yeah. 2%, three,

[06:01]
&gt;&gt; that kind of stuff. Yeah. 2%, three,
four. Especially for apparel, it's so
insane.
&gt;&gt; In any other industry, it's like, "Hey,
how much would you offer?" Uh, 98% less
than what you're asking. Deal. I'll take
it. Sold.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. But they just want the stuff out
of their warehouse, dude. They've got
&gt;&gt; Somebody's calling them going, "Hey,
look, there's 10 truckloads more coming
in."
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; You You Where's it going?
&gt;&gt; It's got to go. The holding costs are so
expensive. This is why FBA, Amazon FBA,
they're like, "Hey, Janet, we're
shipping your stuff back because it's
not selling you. You're gonna pay us and
we're getting rid of it because it's in
their warehouse."
&gt;&gt; So, you can submit these offers. These
deals are up there all the time. You can
do this for Home Depot. You can do
everything. It's It's amazing. It's
amazing.
&gt;&gt; Um, but what I'm really excited about is
for live selling. We're talking about uh
is is this is a new Chrome extension.
It's called the What Not Spy. Uh, it's
made by a company called Resellbot. And
I know the the developer that resalebot
app is amazing. I used it when I sold
7,000 handbags up on Poshmark um to keep
all my whole closet, my store running.

[07:02]
all my whole closet, my store running.
But you can track all the entire stream
of any auction. It pulls out uh you get
their sales tracking, you get the fe,
you get updates updates, you get the
total sales revenue, what they're giving
away. You can monitor multiple streams
and you get all the analytics. So you
can like just do this backward. So you
can go, well this guy's selling shoes.
Well, I'm going to go, "Well, this guy's
selling Hannes sweatshirts. Is Shannon
really full of it or is that real?" You
go find somebody. You search for Hannes.
Go to whatnot. Launch this app. The the
the uh is it a what's it called? The
WhatNot Spy. Launch this app. Pull all
this data. You find out you even know
who they're selling to. You get the
buyers. You get everything in a
spreadsheet that you can download this
thing. Super game. It's It's just a game
changer, dude. It's amazing.
&gt;&gt; What does this app cost?
&gt;&gt; It's free. It's free. He sells a product
called resell bot which I highly
recommend and uh if you're going to get
into it but right now this is just a
free extension.
&gt;&gt; Walk me through an example of how you
could like really reverse engineer

[08:01]
could like really reverse engineer
someone else or how you could monetize
with a tool like this.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So what I would do like I'm
intrigued with this Hannes product but I
don't have the data yet to say is it
worth buying 9,000 pieces or whatever
because it's such a massive load. Now I
know from a wholesale level I could sell
pallets but that's not let's just say
we're going to just do live. So I would
go to whatnot. I would search for Hannes
because I know other people are doing
this uh on whatever level. I would I
would bookmark those sellers and then
get I would turn on notifications, get
alerts when they're starting to sell.
I'd go up, I'd launch the whatnot spy
and I'd start scraping data and I'd let
their show maybe their show is an hour
long and I would at the end of that show
I'd have all this data. Is it really
selling for eight bucks like Shannon
says? No. Maybe it's selling for five
bucks but I I've seen it. It's it's
going to sell for more. But you'll have
the data. Then sort it. Okay. What's the
average sale price of this brand new
Hannes t-shirts or toddler shirts,
whatever se category you're going to be
in. And it'll tell it tells you the
decision. It it will tell you what to

[09:00]
decision. It it will tell you what to
bid. So it will say, "All right, this
this guy sold in an hour. He sold 200
pieces and the average price was $6.80."
Well, then you go back to your Where we
at? No, that was that. You go back here
and say, "Okay, sold for $6.80 on
average. I'm gonna pay if this is 40
cents, there's going to be freight. How
much with the freight? Okay, I'm gonna
do this for uh you know$183.
The freight's going to be the most
expensive part of all these deals. I'm
going to do it for a buck 83. What are
the What are the fees? Handling fees.
Okay, I'm going to do them for $3.
You're going to make five bucks a piece
net.
&gt;&gt; So, what do you do as a as a brand new
whatnot seller? Because I think a a lot
of whatnot is having like followers,
people that are notified when you have a
live event. How do you start from
scratch on what?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. You don't go buy a truckload
of hands to start from scratch. You you
sell stuff you already own. You you
start holding shows. You do giveaways.
I've started dozens of businesses at
this point. And every once in a while,
I'll see some random fee hit an account
that makes zero sense. When you're

[10:01]
that makes zero sense. When you're
dealing with international stuff, you
see it all the time. Currency
conversions eating 3 to 5% on every
transaction. It's insane. Airwalk fixes
this. one global account for you to hold
20 plus currencies and have local bank
details in these countries. You get paid
like a local. No double FX conversions
killing your margin. You can collect
payments in euros, hold them in euros,
pay suppliers in euros. None of that
conversion back and forth. Over 150,000
businesses use them globally. They've
got sameday free international
transfers, multicurrency corporate
cards, built-in expense management, and
payment gateway solutions, too. So stop
bleeding fees and go check out
airwallix.com
your global business without borders.
&gt;&gt; The best thing you can do is start
surrounding yourself with other people
selling on whatnot. Finding, you know,
we have people in our mastermind that
are doing whatnot sales and we do
workshops and it's like, hey, here's how
you do it. Here's what you learn. You

[11:00]
you do it. Here's what you learn. You
have to build an audience. You have to
build a reputation. It's just like e
similar to eBay. If you open up an eBay
account, they're going to limit you,
right? Because they don't know you. So
you want to start small. You want to
sell stuff, you don't want to go buy
things. Just go register for those
accounts today. Start a little bit.
Start buying. Start getting some things.
You should, you know, definitely buy 10
items and and leave good feedback and
they'll get view feedback so you can
start building up a score and slowly
building your credibility. You have to
start today. You can't buy and then
wait, right? So that's that's what you
have to do. I've
&gt;&gt; heard that um whatnot is trying to make
a name for itself by being a lot more
seller friendly as opposed to eBay hates
sellers basically. Is that what you've
experienced?
&gt;&gt; I my experience with eBay is they don't
hate sellers anymore. They used to, but
now they they're very seller friendly.
And there's ways that you need to
connect with like if you're selling on
eBay and let's say you're selling in the
apparel category or the luxury goods
category,
&gt;&gt; find the manager.
&gt;&gt; You have to find the manager, the
category manager and connect with them.
Otherwise, you're nobody. But you
connect with them on LinkedIn and don't

[12:01]
connect with them on LinkedIn and don't
ask them anything. Just say, "Hey, I'm
here. I'm selling. I'm great. Just want
you to give you a heads up if there's
anything ever I could do for you. you'd
like people to speak at a conference or
share their experience, I' I'd love to
help. That's how you start to level up.
&gt;&gt; If you don't do that, eBay are they
going to side with you? In many cases,
&gt;&gt; they are they are very Yeah, they're
very buyer centric from dispute, right?
Just like Amazon cuz they
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; They're going to tell you
&gt;&gt; there's a lot more buyers than sellers,
period.
&gt;&gt; They're going to tell you, Shannon, you
may be right, but it doesn't matter.
you're gonna there's a there's a level
of the business that you do that you
have to eat.
&gt;&gt; It's just inevitable. If you've never
been in business before, you're not
going to win every time. It's not going
to happen. And you're going to give up
and you're going to let your ego, you're
going to get your ego out of it. And
you're just going to have to understand
that this is a business decision. And
two out of a hundred sales I make are
not going to go well. And I may just
have to give them the money back and not
even take get the product back. And
that's going to impact your profit. But
you you don't have time to fight those
battles every day. I see it where people

[13:01]
battles every day. I see it where people
get so wrapped up and they get so angry
and they fight. But you just have to let
it go. Just take a deep breath. That
person doesn't know you. You're an
unknown. They don't know that it's Chris
or Shannon selling stuff. They think
you're someh,
you know, they're not going to miss it.
&gt;&gt; You just let it go and keep moving on
and go sell 98 more items.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Do you um Well, what was I going
to say? Do you do anything with like
sports cards, Pokemon cards on whatnot?
Like live breaks or anything like that?
I don't but I know there people we know
people that are doing that now which I
think is a great opportunity.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; All that stuff.
&gt;&gt; So whatnot seems to be more seller
friendly though.
&gt;&gt; I think so. It it's similar to what
Poshmark is very seller friendly too. No
returns. Whatnot. No returns. That's a
big deal. Now
&gt;&gt; ju just because they say that doesn't
mean you're not going to get returns
because if they if people complain
enough, you're going to solve a problem.
You just go, "Yeah, go ahead. Send it
back." You know, it's not worth it.
&gt;&gt; It's just the culture.
&gt;&gt; It's the culture. They're trying to grow
quick. They're trying to make a name for
themselves. They're on the ground floor
with whatnot. It's similar like Mccuri

[14:00]
with whatnot. It's similar like Mccuri
was similar, but they've really scaled
back. They had a hard time. Uh, but
whatnot is where you need to be right
now. Uh, I also think you should learn
to sell live on Poshmark. They do lots
of different things. You don't even have
to sell it. They have ways to piggyback
your live items with other sellers now,
which I think is really cool.
&gt;&gt; But you're, and I'm not saying that you
need to get up and sell it. You may need
to hire somebody to be to be your
streamer, to be in front, someone that
has a certain look you've got, right?
Yeah. Or your wife or your kid or
whoever. You know, you can be the brains
behind the operation, but you need to
have somebody that is good at talking
and jumping around and being on camera,
maybe some music in the background
because you're trying to get these
people excited. You You're trying to do
the opposite. You want them to buy with
emotion, which is a huge mistake. You
want
&gt;&gt; math, buy with emotion, copyright
Shannine.
&gt;&gt; That's right. And so you flip the whole
thing. You invert. And so with that live
selling, you're getting going. It's like
an it's an auction and people get crazy
at auctions and they don't want to let
it go. And I want that thing and it's
only one more dollar and that's perfect.

[15:00]
only one more dollar and that's perfect.
Over and over and over. Uh I want to go
back and look at that. Okay. So the the
uh the exercise auction sold for 535
bucks. It was I was totally wrong. So
but still it's amazing. Uh
&gt;&gt; um is it is it true that Amazon's
starting to get into live selling? Have
you heard about that? I haven't, but I
wouldn't. I mean, they have to, right?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I heard that they're they're going
to be working directly with big brands
like Nike, like basically using
individuals to sell big brands like Nike
live.
&gt;&gt; I love it.
&gt;&gt; That could change the game.
&gt;&gt; That could totally change the game.
Amazon's offering their their customer
returns directly on their website. Now,
you can buy you can go buy a pallet of
of stuff. They don't even know what it
is. They just give you a rough. It'll be
in this category and you can buy it and
then they have like Yeah. some long-term
window to deliver it to you.
&gt;&gt; Pretty.
&gt;&gt; Can I show you a video that we just I
just posted on my Instagram like an hour
ago.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; I want I want to get your real time
thoughts on this. So,
&gt;&gt; we just posted this like an hour ago. I
just want to get your re I know you
haven't seen this yet because we've been
talking since it was posted. I want to

[16:00]
talking since it was posted. I want to
get your real time take on this business
idea.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Um All right. Here we go.
of this is in Germany, but it needs to
be everywhere. This was on the side of
the road in Germany. It's basically a
big vending machine with lost packages.
You can buy packets full of returned
items and lost packages. You can buy
these vending machines from Facebook
Marketplace or any number of other
places, but sell them for other uses.
Why not put those two things together?
You're not selling products. You're
selling mystery intrigue. It's no
different than people breaking packs of
Pokemon or baseball cards. Whole
business plan here in today's
&gt;&gt; That is amazing. I want some of those.
That is
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that is wild.
&gt;&gt; Oh, all day long because you're selling
the mystery boxes really sell and you're
selling an opportunity and it's almost
like a portable bin store, right? The
bin stores are, you know, $7 an item, $6
the next day, five, whatever, and they
sell that thing. You sip down, you don't
have to staff it. You You just bring and
fill it up.
&gt;&gt; Who's that kid on X? Ethan Cohen that's
got the the the bar um

[17:01]
got the the the bar um
&gt;&gt; you know, vending machines. Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; He'd be perfect. Dude, those things
would be amazing. You split the revenue
with some places that you sell it. You
put them in specific areas like maybe
like laundry mats or some kind of place.
And you you could have different ones.
You could have this is a $10 one. This
is, you know, $30. These are what all
the way up. And you have a golden one
like 100 bucks. Maybe 100 bucks is your
peak. I don't know. I love the idea.
&gt;&gt; You could get you could get an iPhone in
there. You could get a pack of hair
ties.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You just don't know.
&gt;&gt; You don't know. You don't know. But
&gt;&gt; either way, they're enjoying it. They're
enjoying the
&gt;&gt; And you have to I would think I don't
know if you could just stuff it and then
Well, it looked in there. They were just
stuffing them un They didn't know what
it was in. They didn't know what was in
it. Yeah. I think it I think you could
actually adjust that and
&gt;&gt; uh know you would know the seller would
know what's in there. So it would
because you don't want somebody spending
40 bucks and getting a pack of hair
ties. You want some, you know, you want
to make it like uh I did okay. I did
okay. But uh
&gt;&gt; how much how much do the uh like if you
were to buy a pallet of Amazon returns

[18:01]
were to buy a pallet of Amazon returns
that are in like the poly mailers, what
what's like the per unit cost you might
pay for that? A buck, three bucks, five
less. Oh, less really
&gt;&gt; less. Yeah, like it depends on
&gt;&gt; often times it depends on their
category. They have like they call
smalls.
&gt;&gt; I was going to say that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, they
&gt;&gt; if it's electronics it might be 30
bucks.
&gt;&gt; Yes. But the smalls are Yeah. No
manifest. These bin guys, they don't
look at manifest. They just look per
item cost. And it's it's pennies because
they they have to handle it, right? And
then there there's and all their costs
associated. That's how they can sell it
for, you know, $6 on day one, 5 4 3 2 1
all the way out the door. So it's less
than a dollar.
&gt;&gt; See, I would just put like like on the
glass on the plexiglass over the item. I
would put like electronics, clothing,
shoes, just so they knew the category
and then there was a price attached to
each category. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And then I would even have like upsell
options because if they if they buy one
&gt;&gt; Yeah. buy three for
&gt;&gt; Right. Cuz if they buy one and it's
they're not like thrilled about it,
they're not going to buy another one.
Yes.
&gt;&gt; But if like if before they pay it's like

[19:00]
&gt;&gt; But if like if before they pay it's like
listen, it's one for 10 or three for 20.
Yes. You know, they're probably going to
buy three.
&gt;&gt; Of course, everybody will buy.
&gt;&gt; Not just that. Not just that, but then
they have a higher likelihood of one of
those three being a banger and they come
back and buy more.
&gt;&gt; And they'll forget the other ones that
weren't a banger.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Because that's human nature because they
everybody Yeah. Everybody wants
&gt;&gt; one person buying out the whole thing.
&gt;&gt; It could be. Everyone wants to tell
about share what the good deal is.
Everybody wants to and they will fool
themselves into thinking that too. Well,
I didn't pay I didn't get this, but I
only paid this was a great deal though.
I got this. And they leave out that they
spent $60 searching for that one item.
But but that's okay. You're that's
that's part of the fun. It's like on the
It's like being at the carnival, you
know, and buying the spending 20 bucks
to win the big stuffed animal that the
that the carnival paid $4 for.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. That's I love it.
&gt;&gt; Quick question. What if there were a
private community out there of people
that were building businesses based on
this podcast? Well, I just made it and
it's only for business starters and
business builders. It's called TK owners

[20:01]
business builders. It's called TK owners
and it's basically like having me and a
hundred other business geniuses as your
business partner. Also, there's going to
be exclusive new trends, growth hacks,
business ideas, and a database of
everything I've ever talked about.
You'll find thousands of startup case
studies. You'll have weekly ask me
anythings with me while I'll answer your
questions directly. You can join now at
tkowners.com. Link in the show notes.
What I just showed, you can buy that
directly from Amazon.com now. Like a
pallet full of returns.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, you can Yeah, you can buy
you can buy the those to get your money
down. You need to buy contracts and that
contract could be like I'll take a
truckload a week or whatever at this
price point in these categories. That's
that's how you that's how these guys
really drive it down because they make a
commitment and then then they can say,
"Okay, great. We got Chris is going to
take a truckload every week. Shannon,
we've got 500." Just imagine. Do you
know e-commerce returns are 20 to 30%
and going up?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So, just imagine, and I will tell you,
Amazon is not the greatest uh for my

[21:03]
Amazon is not the greatest uh for my
type of business, it's not the best
seller because they just take everything
back and it's just like it's chaos. But
&gt;&gt; they're like the opposite of Costco. The
quality of Costco is so much higher.
&gt;&gt; Um, but for that kind of business or a
bintore business, I think it's amazing.
If I own bin stores, I would own those
machines because you see the line
outside the bin store, right? They start
lining up because you open up on
Thursdays or whatever, there's hundreds
of people waiting because it's a
treasure hunt. But if you in your line,
I would have 10 of those machines.
&gt;&gt; Oh. Or or go find a bin store and put
machines out there.
&gt;&gt; Yep. And it's symbiotic, right? People
will come just for the machines that end
up walking into the bin store and vice
versa.
&gt;&gt; Yep. And you have Make sure you have
cameras out there so you can show it
when the guy picks up the Xbox.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. You're just like boom, that's
money, right? And you have your TV
showing it
&gt;&gt; right above those those devices.
&gt;&gt; Not just that, but it's probably a good
idea to plant your own Xbox in there to

[22:01]
idea to plant your own Xbox in there to
ensure
&gt;&gt; Oh, absolutely. You of course you seat
it. You have to seed it because you want
that excitement because that's going to
drive people to it to you want your kids
as you're driving down through town the
kids to their parents. Dad, can we just
go buy the bin box machine please? Last
time so and so I knew a friend of a
friend, my cousin's buddy won an Xbox
and I want to win one.
&gt;&gt; So these people that own these bin
stores, are they uh are they ex mostly
just buying from Amazon? Is that the
strategy or
&gt;&gt; Target? Target. Uh they Yeah, cuz on
Betock you can buy contracts as well
because Bto has all these relationships.
So if you go to like you can buy
contracts from just about every vendor,
Target, uh Home Depot. So if you level
up like you're buying pallets, pallets,
pallets, then you start buying
individual trucks like we talked about
truckloads. The next level if you're
really doing massive volume is you can
get contracts to say, "Yeah, I'll take a
truck a week or five trucks a week or
whatever it is." That's how you scale it
because they're going to give you better
prices because you it's just repeatable
for them and they just factor it in and

[23:00]
for them and they just factor it in and
their biggest their biggest problem they
have is there's 10 more truck hundred
more truckloads coming in behind them.
