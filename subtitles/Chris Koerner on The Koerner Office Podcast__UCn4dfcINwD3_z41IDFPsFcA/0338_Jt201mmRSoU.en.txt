my friend Sam makes $46,000 in profit
per pergola that he built here's exactly
how he does it and how you can copy he
uses Facebook ads to find leads and he
buys perola kits online for $3 to $4,000
then he'll Outsource all the labor for
$22,000 and he charges about $9 to
$12,000 per job the only tools you need
are basic woodworking tools sometimes
you need a permit from the city which
costs between $50 and $500 he only uses
Cedar pergas cuz that enables him to
charge the most installation only takes
1 to two days with a crew of two to
three workers full business business
