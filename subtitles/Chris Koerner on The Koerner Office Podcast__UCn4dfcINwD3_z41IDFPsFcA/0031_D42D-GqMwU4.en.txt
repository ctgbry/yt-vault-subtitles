things we covered uh wedding Biz so this
guy has a dad with a YouTube channel
that does done for you destination
weddings and they hit a plateau and they
wanted to know how to grow interesting
business and then we have a board game
business super cool this guy's got a
small board game up in the Northeast and
I gave him some cool ideas on how to
grow it we have an RV park he wanted to
stay Anonymous but he's having occupancy
issues so I gave him some tips there the
next business was a monument business as
in gravestones and headstones and he
wants to know how should he approach the
owner to buy it second to last was a
presubmit question about selling digital
signage to schools how he can find
schools to sell to and then the last
question one of the best was a dumpster
rental business in Salt Lake and he just
ordered a ton of dumpsters and he wants
to know how am I going to rent all these

[01:00]
to know how am I going to rent all these
things out so he really liked my ideas
and I hope you do too enjoy episode 8 of
the ker
office hey what's going on Chris how are
you good how are you man I'm doing well
huge fan of your podcast I'm watching
your journey on X and three your
newsletter thanks for doing this
absolutely yeah thanks for joining I saw
your DM and it was I'm remembering bits
and pieces of it but I I purposely
whenever I see DMs like that I try to
not read into them too much because I
don't want to bias myself I don't want
to do research I just know that your dad
has like a an events or a wedding
business and he drives leads from
YouTube and that's all I remember so
let's hear what you've got going on yeah
great memory so for background You're
right our family runs a travel company
that specializes in planning destination
weddings in Mexico and the Caribbean
we've been in business for about 30
years never really done any marketing so
in a given year we'll plan let's say 80
to 100 weddings which translate to about
7,000 guests across all those weddings

[02:01]
7,000 guests across all those weddings
and like you said about 80% of those
leads come from our YouTube channel and
the rest are from client referrals CH
get your take on some creative ways we
can ramp up our marketing and reach
prospective couples outside of really
just paid ads through search and display
some things we thinking out are like
bridal shows which we've tried in the
past but haven't had a really great
effort um partnering with vendors
everyone from wedding planners to DJs to
uh makeup artists and then tapping into
our email list like I said we have 7,000
guests who will help plan in a given
year um across those 80 to 100 weddings
and we don't do anything except send
them their travel documents send them
their uh reminder to pay their bill
things like that so A few things we
kicking around but curious to get your
take okay so tell me about like the unit
economics of the business how it works
how he makes money and I'm curious to
know like at what capacity is he today
like with his current infrastructure
help whatever is he would he like to
double the size is there already 80% of
the way there it's a good question so we
have about uh eight people who help

[03:00]
have about uh eight people who help
manage the groups and so I would say
each of them could probably add 20 to
30% more so I think if we're doing 80 to
100 weddings a year we could probably
ramp that up to 12 140 and the unit
economics so in a given group again if
you assume 80 groups per year each group
is about 60 to 70 guests each person is
paying on average about $1,000 and you
can call it about a 20% margin per
person so there's a decent margin per
ring which is why I think there's an
opportunity to to funnel some money back
into
growth Okay so what is like the total
ticket size of one wedding to you so
gross revenue would be about between 60
and 100 Grand depend on obviously how
many people and how expensive the resort
is and then for us that translates to
about 8 to 12 Grand 8 to 12 Grand and
you're doing 80 to 100 of those per year
correct okay so you're up against that
that million dollar threshold that can
be hard to to break through it seems as
far as exactly and that's why we're like
okay how do we ramp it up without just
hiring access and one of the sort of

[04:00]
hiring access and one of the sort of
smart ways to do it and not just dump a
ton of money into Google okay and so you
think with the eight people you have you
could realistically grow your business
50% correct give your take okay tell me
about this email list 7,000 people and
over how long have you acquired all
those emails so that's each year we're
adding about 7,000 people just through
them traveling with us uh and opting
into emails with us obviously they
haven't opted into email marketing so we
need to shift the way we collect emails
and and have it be a double opt-in so
since we started emailing folks was
probably 2018 2017 but I think in the
last year or two when we've made it more
concered double optin you're probably
looking at 10 to 12,000 people on that
list over the last like year and a half
two years okay 10 to 12,000 people that
have double opted in that you can
legally just start sending mass emails
to and then if you were to guess outside
of those 10,000 people how many emails
do you have that were just transactional

[05:00]
do you have that were just transactional
emails that did not opt in I would say
about double
that okay because the way I see it it's
there's a cold email and then there's an
email to someone that maybe went to one
of your weddings three years ago that
didn't double opt in but it's hey do you
remember us you went to so and so's
wedding now let me before I continue
that are these email addresses of guests
to the wedding correct yeah so obviously
the couples too but it would be all the
guests of the wedding who travel and
again they heard from us over the course
of a 12 month booking period they would
have heard from us know six to 10 times
and so it's a pretty warmed up list
again they may not have opted into
receiving email marketing from us but
they've heard from us if we email them
it's typically like a 60 to 80% optim
because or uh open rate because we're
typically sending them their documents
for travel or hey don't forget you know
you got to add someone to your room by
this deadline things like that okay I
love it I love this so I would start by
segmenting your email list I would start
there I think you're on the right track
I would make

[06:00]
I would make
multiple buckets okay so let's say
there's an opt-in bucket of emails let's
say that's 10,000 people let's and then
there's the non- opted in bucket okay
there's two segments and then I would
make a segment for brides specifically
and then a segment for Grooms
specifically and then I would make
segments for do you now do you have data
that tells you like a guest of the Bride
or a guest of the groom we don't no
that's
a
down the road yeah exactly yeah okay so
then I would make segments by year by
wedding party and then also one for each
both the opted in and the non- opted in
group and okay and then I
would forget like a MailChimp or a mass
email service I would do the same thing
with all of these whether they're oped
in or not because you are legally
allowed to email the people that did not
in because they're like you have their

[07:01]
in because they're like you have their
email you have a relationship maybe it
was how long has the business been in
business again it's been 30 years but
really the sort of current iteration
since 2016 2017 okay so the oldest
emails go back like six seven eight
years yeah exactly okay I would say
those are fair games so you have a
history with these guys you have a
relationship I would use a simple Chrome
extension like gmass or use like a
standalone service like mixmax or LM
list and I would just start a trickle
campaign start with 50 emails a day um
AB test the heck out of this so you want
to know and this is AB testing so you
can know it it doesn't really matter if
you AB test between optin and non opted
in and not opted in but you want to know
which approach is working right so I
would still segment the opted in versus
the not opted in so you could know if
the response rate is different between
the two but I would really worry about

[08:00]
the two but I would really worry about
how you email both groups does that make
sense yeah okay so then I would send
just a plain text email with
whoever has been communicating with this
person the most I'm sure you've changed
hands or you've changed headcount over
the years so if that usually comes from
your dad or his assistant or whoever try
to keep it as constant as possible to
what they experienced back when they
went to that wedding one to eight years
ago and just say hey first name do you
remember ask like we we helped you get
to the insert bride and grooms names
wedding at insert location and just
personalize the heck out of this because
you have that data say I know this is
random we haven't spoken in a while but
do you know of anyone else that is
getting married now the way I see it if
this list is eight years old all these
people know other people that are
getting married especially the brides
and the Grooms maybe they're 25 when
they got married and they're 33 now
maybe they were were 28 when they got

[09:00]
maybe they were were 28 when they got
married and they're 30 now like they are
in the time of their lives when they
know people getting married and they are
begging you silently begging you for a
reminder of what a beautiful wedding
looks like but they will not remember
unless you pop up in their
inbox and because of the fact that you
have a $110,000 ticket item you can
offer really generous referral fees
maybe it's a $500 Amazon gift card or
we'll venmo you $1,000 or $200 and I
would experiment with all of those
thresholds and push it to where you're
uncomfortable because this is a test
right in worst case you come close to
breaking even on one wedding and then
you're like all right we're not doing
$1,000 anymore because we didn't make
any money but we did spend $1,000 to
learn this new marketing channel that is
almost unlimited right because if you
can dial in the right segment with the
right offer the right referral amount

[10:02]
right offer the right referral amount
like this it just becomes a compounding
snowball where you can just keep getting
referrals from all these new weddings as
you go and you might not even ever have
to worry about paid ads right that makes
a ton of sense yeah 100% and that's
something we've talked about and we just
a we're using a CRM that feels like it's
from 1999 and B we're so busy planning
the weddings that we forget that after
these like I said 70 people travel for a
wedding it's okay thanks so much for
traveling we hope you had a great time
let us know if you need anything but we
drop it there as opposed to following up
but a year after letting hey remember
you traveled a year ago what's new and
here's some new destinations for you to
check out we have that data on where
they went and when they went and why
they traveled but to your point we
haven't done anything with that so it's
super helpful oh yeah you could also use
chat GPT upload a list of your 20 most
popular locations have chat GPT give you
like facts about those areas and we like
you went to the Bahamas but did you know
that most people that go to the Bahamas
do this or do that that would be an
amazing wedding we're really excited for

[11:00]
amazing wedding we're really excited for
something like this like you want to
show your energy and your enthusiasm in
the email and I I wish I could just
shout from the rooftops stop sending big
fancy emails with these big like
well-designed graphics and pictures like
just plain text emails so your first
task is to segment everything and start
this campaign and just see how it goes
and keep adjusting these AB tests and
then once you feel like you've got a
winning formula then set up a drip
campaign to fix this in the future so
you won't have to make this a big
Endeavor every year or so right like you
could automate all of this but I would
suggest never ever make big fancy emails
from the mail chimps of the world keep
them plain text from your Gmail that
look handwritten no pictures the shorter
the better the shorter subject lines the
better every word you add to a subject
line your open rate will decrease so
it's just experiment with like question
or wedding
or random I I promise you those subject

[12:02]
or random I I promise you those subject
lines perform the best but I think that
will work I love it this is awesome
you're on my brain spinning on some
ideas to to start testing these good
yeah let me know how it goes I hope it
works out for you and your parents cool
thanks Chris I really appreciate it
thanks again for uh doing this no
problem have a good day you too see you
here we got suede all am I saying your
name right or no you're saying perfect
yeah how you doing I'm good how are you
lovely lovely thank you for taking the
time to talk to me I really appreciate
it absolutely I love it loving the
energy today I want to hear about your
board game business okay awesome my name
is suede I have a also a co-founder
named salar we invented the Lost lands
of ver that's a fantasy based game okay
and it takes the best elements of
Monopoly Katon games you love like Risk
wraps it up and removes all the bad
parts it's story based so it's ever
expanding you can we can come up with
new equipment new spell cards new item
cards everything like that and it's been

[13:02]
cards everything like that and it's been
doing really well amongst the New York
Community and so on and so forth and we
have like boxes going all over the place
we're at a Crossroads because we don't
know what to do
next yeah that's where we're at what in
what way do you not know what to do next
do we make another game do we just grow
this game do we have an expansion to
this game is that kind of what you're
thinking it's actually the simple answer
is how do we scale this up now we have
all of our other questions answered like
our manufact facturing is great our
Logistics are wonderful we launched
pre-orders last year in March simply
through word of mouth no marketing on
any type of paid service and we raised
20K through that we have boxes going to
Toronto Chicago La all over the place
right and the game requires around three
four three to four players to play so
even one person buys the Box three
people are getting exposed and so on and
so forth right
um but at this point it's okay what is

[14:03]
um but at this point it's okay what is
the best way to expand and so other
companies like ours other like board
game designers they go a few
routes you have the kickstarter route
right we did a community build right it
and then the next step is going outside
the community to people we've never met
before people who don't even know
anything about us or the game but they
come on Kickstarter and it it's one of
those things it's definitely a route to
take
the other routes include just scaling
with exposure getting like a small
business loan and just spending on
marketing spending on ads spending on
videos Tik Tok Instagram Facebook
getting it that way I mean as well as
going to board game conventions going to
places where people are already in the
space and then the last part is going
and invest route not as flashy as Shark
Tank maybe but something along the lines
Venture Capital someone who is a good
value add to the business who can

[15:01]
value add to the business who can
provide maybe Distributing rights or
something that they're already connected
in these spaces or all they have to do
is check a few boxes contact a few
people get some equity in the game and
then blow the game up
itself okay what is the feedback on your
game do do you get any negative feedback
or is it just universally oh we love it
so much do people play it multiple times
or they buying it and it's a one and
done no they're playing like we so what
happens I told you pre-orders right
the boxes from the the pre-orders of
March just came in end of February we
distributed a few and before that it was
just me and my guy going door too with
our sample boxes and playing but since
then like once people have boxes one guy
played seven days straight every night
he brought few people over and they
played and great feedback that's the
reason we're putting so much time and
effort like we all both have day jobs
right now actually really funny I saw
your Tweet about being a dentist I'm a
mhm so I was like actually you're not

[16:01]
mhm so I was like actually you're not
wrong you're not wrong I would never say
go 350k in debt for only a two multiple
but thankfully I went a different route
but good yeah so that's what it is like
universally over the last year as well
any negative feedback that we've gotten
any criticism we've actually adjusted it
before we sent the order right okay
we've added any small specs we've been
play testing and the best part about the
game itself is any new rendition any
update since this box is completely
valid right any criticism we get or
anything that's fun to add we just add
there's no like finite product because
it's such a story based game and it's
not like chess that's another thing it's
not like chess or Checkers or Monopoly
where you get it once and that's it we
have expansion packs we have cards we
can add different characters we add with
different classes and everything like
that how big is your business today what
is your profitability like per unit
we're at 50%

[17:00]
we're at 50%
profitability okay gross 20K so far
where okay like grow 50% gross like cogs
oh cogs again I am I'm new to the
business aspect that's okay just like
what it costs to to manufacture versus
you sell it for 50% because 50% of our
price point is going to go towards
manufacturing okay got and that's for
like our first run minimum order
quantity of
500 okay and what is the the real dollar
amount of your manufact in cost
$48.99 that's what it costs you to make
yes oh wow so you're selling this for
100 bucks y okay man that seems like a
lot you would think so but that's also
because we're doing a premium set so one
thing going forward with the kickstarter
would be there's a premium set with full
metal coins full metal aspects and a
plastic set the reason we went with
premium first is because within the
community if something messes up they
can contact me or solar directly we can
fix any the problems with our

[18:00]
fix any the problems with our
manufacturing if it goes too big too
fast and we're having problems I'd
rather solve that right now before it
explodes as far as plastic people do
plastic all the time like the
manufacturers over there they're ready
to do plastic and since we already what
does that cost that would probably drop
our cost in half
24.99 is what the plastic cost would be
yeah but because we made the molds
already we already took the brunt of
that in the metal so our molds are made
for the Plastics when eventually come
because yeah we would like to have two
tiers we're right now we're selling the
deluxe version with everything involved
I feel like the plastic version is a
great way to get people in love with
your game and then they'll want to buy
the deluxe version after and you could
get two sales out of the same person
exactly whereas you can't today have you
experimented at all with like board game
stores SE like seeding your product for
free to board game stores or influencers
so yeah that's that is again the
crossroads R this is one of the Avenues
we can go now that we have product in
hand and we have excess stock we can now

[19:02]
hand and we have excess stock we can now
just go like where I want to say maybe
40 orders yeah 4K away from Break Even
for this whole business okay so we're
right there at profitability and I don't
think it's would be hard to sell 40 but
yeah from the excess boxes that we have
from our first order we are going to go
to at least local right now New York
City board game stores and going to get
that started right away okay I love what
you said about how marketing is built in
for this because you can't play by
yourself no you can't it's the best so
people will want their own version then
they're going to invite people then
they're going to invite people so I feel
like the the plastic version needs to be
higher on your priority list okay so you
can seed that version for free to I
would do meetup groups Go to meetup.com
scrape every single board game group or
laring group or whatever it is whatever
your target market is and give it to the
the lead of the group for free but beg

[20:00]
the lead of the group for free but beg
him to use it that's what most people
don't realize is seating is easy like
seating to bigname influencers small
name influencers Meetup Group Leaders
whatever the hard part is getting them
to use the thing right we did that with
this product we sold to restaurants we
sold it or we sent it for free to
restaurants and once they tried it they
loved it but they would never try it and
it it it differs based on the market
restaurant owners are busy right it's
it's Unique but you've you've got to put
10 times the work into convincing them
to actually try it than convincing them
to accept it for free makes sense but I
feel if you can get it in the hands of
30 people and get 10 of them to play it
then you're going to have a big enough
sample size to know if that's a winning
strategy for really scaling your growth
and then if that works I would exhaust
all of the meetup groups like everyone
there is and then you're also going to
find some meetup groups that have

[21:00]
find some meetup groups that have
nothing to do with board games that are
just your target market and so I would
do a bunch of research when you talk to
your customers you get your feedback
awesome you love it okay great now I
want to know about you like are you
white collar Blue Collar older younger
Rich poor male female and try to develop
a a Persona or an avatar of who your
customer is so you can find pockets of
potential customers that aren't like
obvious board game owners like I love
board games I for instance I'm a I'm in
a family of six I've got four kids we
play board games all the time you would
never see the product with me because
I'm not like a that's not I don't
identify as a board gamer but if we got
your product we'd probably love it so
maybe it's parents of a bunch of kids
maybe it's Utah right where all my
people live that's in all seriousness
those are big board gamers over there
because they don't drink they don't
smoke they don't go out they play board
games same thing with the Muslim
Community we don't drink we don't okay
perfect yeah that's right those are my

[22:01]
perfect yeah that's right those are my
people too you are my people and that
sounds great I would reverse engineer
what the big board games have done to
grow I would find the founders listen to
all the podcasts they've been uh
interviewed on read all the articles I
would ignore the ones like was it the
humanity cards of humanity yeah what's
it called I would ignore I would ignore
that because you probably agree that
card games are a bit different and that
was a viral phenomenon I would ignore
the ones that blew up only during Co cuz
you can't rely on that but find like the
what is it what is the train game called
Ticket to Ride Ride yeah Monopoly Katana
stuff like that Cod code names like the
ones that were not popular what's it
called the ones that are like five to 20
years old I would do really real deep
Dives on them okay and also I don't know
if it helps but my in-laws are good
friends with the who are the people that
did did the cover your assets game game

[23:00]
did did the cover your assets game game
cover your ass actually never heard that
one cover your asset oh that's cover
it's like a financial game it's fun it's
Grandpa Beck you heard of Grandpa Becks
no that sounds awesome okay Grandpa Beck
it's it's actually a pretty big company
they cover your assets Skull
King okay I think cover your assets was
like their big one anyway it's a pretty
big company and my in-laws are are
friends with the owners so I'm happy to
make an introduction there if that could
help absolutely I would love to send you
a game I would absolutely I'd love to
play it yeah for sure but yeah I think
that's a lot that's a lot to get you
started and I want to hear how it goes
absolutely brother this is great I think
yeah we've been trying to figure out our
Avatar because like you said you're
people my people it's in that audience
right now and we're trying to break it
out so our one Avenue was going to go to
the board game c can't hear you oh there
you
are okay but but meetup.com I think
that's a great one meetup.com and scrape

[24:00]
that's a great one meetup.com and scrape
that website for the leaders right there
we're right there we can give out games
at this very moment and we'll be totally
perfect you can do it even more when you
have a cheaper version
exactly amazing that's cool great I'm
excited for you thank you man I
appreciate Facebook group yeah Facebook
groups that'd be great one final
question if we're signing off so this is
the better Avenue right now with the
Meetup and placing is and seating versus
just doing paid marketing you would yep
okay perfect yeah cuz that is such a
black hole that you could sink so much
money into it's you don't know how many
times I I've had these ad campaigns it's
yeah we'll do 100 a day let's do 150 day
and then that's five grand a month yeah
oh my gosh what are we doing what have
we gotten from this so of course it
works right like Facebook and Google are
trillion dollar companies because it
works but I I like to leave I never like
to fly rely on paid ads for a business

[25:00]
to fly rely on paid ads for a business
to be successful because the the
algorithm can change at any point but
you're in a really good spot if you can
do more organic options and then say
shoot let's just do paid ads now because
why not it's just more money agree agree
H I'm very excited man I thank you so
much I really appreciate all this advice
and I will connect with you let me know
how to as well just email you back with
stuff yeah yep sounds good to me all
right thanks see you you have a great
day to anyone that is watching right now
welcome to episode 8 of the ker office
where we discuss business advice and how
to grow your business how to sell your
business if you should buy a business if
you should quit your job if you're
joining here for the first time that's
what this is and so Steve filled out the
form and all I know is that he has an RV
park in an undisclosed location that he
would like some help with Steve why
don't you tell us what you're what's
you're struggling with yeah I came into
a park a few years ago it in a kind of

[26:02]
a park a few years ago it in a kind of
the out outskirts of a metro in a suburb
it's one of the older Parks it's very
centrally located an older part of town
it had quite
notoriety it was a pretty rough Park
when we took over the
park a lot of work was done to turn it
around and it has a great trajectory now
a lot of improvements have been made but
since it was such a rough park for so
long bringing the rents up to current
market there was a lot of push back but
that's old news so most of the upgrades
are done rents are picking up it's a a
68 pad Park we we're we're just having
trouble filling the last few pads we're
trying to figure out how to to
accomplish that we mostly get our
traffic from craigsl and our website I

[27:00]
traffic from craigsl and our website I
just started a Facebook profile
yesterday and just wondering what was
the what would be a best way to
advertise our
vacancies so how long have you owned the
park and then what did you bring rents
to and where were they before they under
previous ownership they're about 300 a
month which is well under Market because
it was the mar the park was shambles
it's up to 600 now which is still on the
low end for the area there's only two
other
parks in the
Metro that are lower and our biggest
perk or benefit is we don't have as
restrictive as an age limit so it's the
most affordable for for the community
and we've been controlling it for about
four years okay so you doubled rents

[28:00]
four years okay so you doubled rents
basically from 3 to 600 and did you do
that four four years ago or over time
over time mostly trying to do damage
control from the last
owners yeah okay and what has the
reaction been to that uh negative but
just knee-jerk reaction but when you
look at the totality of the situation if
rents aren't brought near market with
the taxes going up they go they went up
last year almost 50%
and if the park isn't making any money
or breaking even then because it's so
Cally located there's no Park and it's
going to be a shopping center or who
knows what have you explained that the
why of raising your rents to your
tenants do you have any sort of
communication system like emails or
letters and how what does that look like
so we have on-site property manager that
is very Hands-On and communicates with
everyone at the park we do not do a

[29:01]
everyone at the park we do not do a
newsletter or anything like that because
most of the residents aren't really tied
in I guess we could do a paper
newsletter but as far as logging in and
doing that sort of stuff it's not really
the preferred method to communicate in
this park it's it's pretty old school in
that sense folks are writing checks and
we've so yeah to answer your question
it's mostly just par gossip and the
on-site manager communicating through
people individually and questions come
up and has your has you or your manager
communicated specifically why you've
raised rents and it's like very
specifics the taxes going up and all of
those
things yes uh mostly focused on taxes
and Market rates and the outcome of not
addressing those headon and the rent
increases are are very gradual like 50
bucks a
every year do you own any park owned

[30:01]
every year do you own any park owned
Park owned units or are they all tenant
owned they're all tenant owned first of
all I looked at your reviews and they
looked a little bad and which is
understandable considering they've had
their rents raised but I think you could
do a lot more with regards to
communication and I like to say in my
businesses communication cover a
multitude of sins and it really does
because yes you're raising rents but the
more you communicate the why and I know
you already have but the more you over
Comm unicate the why the more Goodwill
you'll buy them
and I I know that they're not techsavvy
but you do have a website and so if I
were you I would just do a monthly
newsletter and so we're talking an hour
a month of your time I think it should
be you doing this that's just very like
what's happening here's how everything's
looking even here's what occupancy like
is like you could do an a like a tenant
Spotlight with a head shot of hey this
is our favorite tenant of the month and
here's why did you know this guy served
and this war or did you know this person

[31:00]
and this war or did you know this person
has 37 grandkids that really goes a long
way and it helps spark conversations
within the community and these are all
tangential to your ultimate problem and
and I'm getting to that but if you were
to do that on your website surely
they're not going to go to your website
but then if you were to have an SMS
distribution list once a month that just
links to your website to that blog
article um you could also do a paper
newsletter but I think this is just
easier uh I think that would go a long
way you could just address the rent
increases first paragraph get it out of
the way we know it sucks but this park
by name is 650 this other park by name
is 675 these guys don't have these
amenities we do and then you go into the
tenant Spotlight here's what's happening
the history of the park and just do
something like that once a month and I
think you'll start to see reviews
trickling up trickling in and going up I
think also if you were to talk to your
Park manager and ask him like which
tenants are great which tenants love us

[32:02]
tenants are great which tenants love us
which tenants are happy go to them
specifically and solicit five star
reviews because I think the the sooner
you can get your average review above
4.0 the sooner that you'll just
naturally see your occupancy start to
increase and I would honestly tell your
tenants maybe you have but if you
haven't tell them what the rent increase
schedule is going to look like into the
future like maybe it's been $50 a year
but maybe you're good for a while tell
them that or maybe it's going to keep
being $50 a year they should know that
if so that's that's like tangential
that's just like best practices that I
would suggest and it can help improve
the occupancy which for those of us for
those of you just joining that is the
question how can you get his occupancy
up now you're already at 89% or so so
you don't have a lot left to go that
tells me that your rents are getting
close to Market you just started a
Facebook page yesterday that's great I
didn't hear you say that you're using
Facebook Marketplace to advertise

[33:00]
Facebook Marketplace to advertise
vacancies I would definitely do that put
an add up without boosting it see how it
goes if it doesn't go well enough then
boost it I know you're in a pretty big
area you're in city limits I feel like
you should be able to get it to 100%
within a few months if you did this if
you go that route and you spend a little
money and it doesn't work I would I
would seriously consider buying three to
four units RVs nicer ones and seller
financing them to new tenants I have
never once ever had an issue getting new
tenants in if I deliver them a unit with
a bow on it you don't have to maintain
it because your seller financing it to
them of course you have to look up local
regulations but that is always like the
last lever I pull to boost occupancy
because it never fails
me very great that yeah and followup
question would be you think Google ads
would be useful at all or add I've never

[34:00]
would be useful at all or add I've never
seen Google ads be useful I've seen
other people do it there's no way of
knowing if it's successful for them or
if it's just they're just burning money
or if they're just trying it and they
end up abandoning it I'm sure it can be
I've just it's never worked for me but
what does work for me is if the Facebook
Marketplace boost doesn't work then use
Facebook ads like just normal meta ads
through the the business manager
platform targeted in that area at lower
income people and that usually helps as
well excellent thank you absolutely wish
you the best of luck and come back and
tell us how it goes sounds good thanks
Chris hey guys this next segment is a
little different we had a guy named
Claude call in and he wanted to know how
he should approach the owner of a
monuments business I think he's outside
of Chicago he was having some technical
difficulties as he dialed in and then we
went and listened to the recording when
it was over and we didn't get his voice
at all for some reason you can just hear

[35:00]
at all for some reason you can just hear
me answering questions and talking so
I'm just going to give you a brief kind
of intro of what he was talking about
and then we'll edit my section to make
it more to make it make sense so yeah
Claude wants to buy business and he
drives by this Monument business like a
a gravestone headstone business every
day on the way to work they took care of
his um sister-in-law when she passed
away a few years ago and he just thinks
it'd be a good business to own so he
wanted to know should iy this business
how do I approach the owner and so I I I
talked to him a lot about developing
relationship and complimenting him on
his business and yeah you'll see what
I'm talking about so hope you enjoy so I
would start by just pulling in on your
way to work and just meeting meeting him
and just being very transparent and lead
with compliments that is the absolute
best thing you can do like you took care
of my sister-in-law I like you did such
a great job yada y Y and I I drive by

[36:00]
a great job yada y Y and I I drive by
this place every day which makes me
think about both my sister-in-law and
that experience and this as a business
frankly and this is really random but
would like would you ever be interested
in selling your business and just like
totally feel it out and it could be a
hard no but it could be the first step
that gets you to learn about this
business and gets you to fall in love
with it and go find a different one to
acquire but I would play the long game
here and say you don't know me from Adam
but I just I'm fascinated by this
business I think it's a good business uh
and I just wanted to get your thoughts
and if he kind of hems and haw then
that's probably a yes that this is
something he's been thinking about and
you're strike you're striking a nerve
here but he doesn't know you well enough
to be more
transparent but if he's just and he
probably will hem and ha he's probably
not going to say yes like how much do
you want to offer and he's probably not
going to say never never because he's
old right he has to do something with it
you can even tell him like a stat and I

[37:01]
you can even tell him like a stat and I
would Google it cuz I'm going to butcher
this but something like two 2third of
businesses never sell they just close
down and a lot of those business owners
don't even know their business has value
they just don't and it does I don't care
what business I don't care if it's a
oneman show and you've got an HVAC
business and it's only you and
everything's in your head there's still
something to that business like at a
worst case you could have your grandson
write down everything and sell it in a
course there's something there and so
maybe tell him that and say I just find
it honestly a shame that so much value
is going to waste as these baby boomers
retire these businesses like they will
literally go to waste this value will be
destroyed and the people that need your
service will not be able to get it which
means due to the laws of supply and
demand they're going to have to pay more
for a headstone because there'll be a
lot less Supply than there is demand and
so it's just no one wins if a business
closes no one and so I would just lead

[38:01]
closes no one and so I would just lead
with that and maybe the first stop is 3
minutes and it's just like you stop in
one day and it's you know what I pass
there every day and you took care of my
sister and I just wanted to shake your
hand and meet you and thank you and
you're doing a good job with the
community and then maybe a week later I
can't get this thought out of my head
and then you go into would you ever be
willing to sell um because I think I
don't really need to do the research
that's a good business and it's only
going to get better just looking at
human demographic I I assume you're
going to want to ask for some percentage
of seller financing and the more of a
relationship you can develop with him
the more likely he is going to be to say
yes to that worst case he becomes like a
mentor and he just teaches you a few
things that make you love the business
and you buy a different one so this is
from they want to be anonymous so this
is from Anonymous they say hey Chris I'd
like it your take on a question around
growth I run a digital signage
management business essentially we make
communication easier for busy schools we

[39:01]
communication easier for busy schools we
take basic written
instructions okay convert this to
engaging video-based content and push it
remotely through a CMS content
management system we are year in out of
42 customers only one didn't resign for
year two so let's recap before I keep
reading digital signage management
business never heard those words put
together they make communication easier
for busy schools okay all right I've
tweeted about this before we take a
written instruction convert it to
engaging video all right so it's I get
an email from a principal that's yada
yada yada this is what we're doing super
boring they take it and turn it into
videos which is smart Okay so he had 42
customers and only one churned a good
number went from wanting one screen
managed to two up to now I assume
they're putting these videos on the
publicly facing screen somewhere up to
now I've tried all I've tried is direct
response mail ads to schools in a couple

[40:00]
response mail ads to schools in a couple
of months I'll do my first event where
300 to 350 School leaders will attend
I've also started to generate
relationships with District level
decision makers who would manage groups
of schools but this isn't the easiest
thing to cultivate any ideas around
growth maybe it's down to better ad copy
in the
mailers or perhaps a Gilla approach that
I hadn't considered as a bookend here I
have started thinking are there
opportunities in Industry like Factory
workplaces I haven't really tried to
validate that side it could be
interesting perhaps higher ticket your
wisdom is appreciated so I have to
assume some things because he's not
calling in live so I'm going to make
some assumptions that his Market is big
enough to grow his school Market is big
enough to grow he's acquired 42
customers and I imagine these are bigger
customers these are higher ticket items
because it's a school maybe even a
school district he has basically no
churn I assume they love him he's able
to find 42 BTS businesses to school

[41:01]
to find 42 BTS businesses to school
customers through Direct Mail ads and he
wants to grow so what I'm wondering
without him being here to answer is why
not just more direct mail ads I'm afraid
that he's only done like kind of
halfhazard all right let's send out some
mailers let's send out 400 all right 402
convert send out 4,000 402 convert
mailers work only if you send them a ton
there's a Tipping Point for every
industry but you've got do at least four
or five batches quick story when I moved
my company to DFW it was called LCD
cycle and we sold iPhone parts to iPhone
repair stores we used direct mailers and
it freaking worked we had five rounds of
them and they all had the same theme
like same kind of layout on the post
there were postcards but different
colors and so when they got one in the
mail it was like a trigger like a Pavlov
dog oh ding Yep this looks familiar this
is from the LCD cycle it's a different
offer we even had one of our offers of

[42:01]
offer we even had one of our offers of
hey we bought a boat in DFW come at
boating with us on the weekends with me
personally the owner because who else
was doing that no one like everyone
wants a vendor that has a boat or that
has a country club membership or that
has the box seats at the Mavericks game
that's what I was trying to be I was
like these I had a low churn just our
our question asker here I had a low too
they spent thousands a month and they
never churn so I thought shoot if I buy
a $40,000 boat that gets me one customer
it'll pay for itself and so that was
like our third or fourth postcard but we
didn't see hit rates on these postcards
until the third or fourth or fifth or
sixth so you just got to keep mailing if
that's working like selling to schools
is one of the hardest types of customers
to acquire so if you already doing it
successfully then don't spin your wheels
thinking about factories or workplaces
or paid ads or anything just send them a
ton of mailers maybe even some chunky

[43:02]
ton of mailers maybe even some chunky
mailers put something in there a little
trinket a pencil or something something
that relates to schools and you have it
you have your running for formula just
scale it keep sending them more all
right we've got Bailey hey you're going
to be our last caller so if there's
anyone else waiting I'm sorry but we'll
get to you next week because I gotta
drive to a wedding soon okay thanks for
having me on I really appreciate it
absolutely I want to hear about your
dumpster rental business okay yeah I've
been in business for about six weeks now
took quite a while to get funding for
the dumpsters and the truck and
everything so I ended up flying into
Texas buying a truck and 11 dumpsters
and driving them back to Salt Lake and
we have had those for about six weeks
now and things are going really well but
I mostly just wanted to kick your brain
about some unique ways to Market to
either contractors or Builders and get
some more like long-term contracts most
of our customers right now are
homeowners which has been great but

[44:00]
homeowners which has been great but
we're spending a fortune on Google ads
and those traditional marketing channels
and so I wanted to pick your brain about
Landing commercial jobs working with
General Contractors or Builders or
there's anybody like pulling permits
I've thought about marketing too wanted
to just get some of your advice on that
so you just went ahead and bought a
truck like I assume a truck to move
these things around plus 11 dumpsters in
Texas and just started from scratch or
is this a business that you uh bought
started from scratch yeah wow okay what
about the industry or business made you
want to just go all in on this and I
like the business too don't get be wrong
I'm just curious what your mindset is
yeah so I've been flipping houses for
the last three or four years and had to
rent them all the time and started just
running the numbers on them and you can
buy a dumpster for probably all in after
painting and decals you're like 5,500
bucks and you can rent them out for 350
a week it's also just really like
operationally it's pretty simple right
now I've got a full-time driver and then
a full-time office manager that takes
calls and schedules so operationally

[45:01]
calls and schedules so operationally
it's pretty simple to scale the biggest
thing is it's just really Capital
intensive that's the biggest downside
but yeah that that was most of the
appeal is I've paid for them all the
time and they're pretty
profitable okay how what percentage of
capacity are you right now with your 11
dumpsters it depends on the week so like
last I think two Fridays ago it was
really warm out and we hit Max Capacity
we all of the dumpsters were out of our
yard but earlier this week we were at 0%
you know capacity so we didn't have
anything booked and then this Friday
it's warm again so we've got a lot so
that's one reason I'm wanting to move
more into the commercial space is there
a lot more consistent a lot of these
Weekend Warriors want to rent one when
the sun comes out um I've got 12 more
dumpsters coming on the 15th so I'm
really going to need to increase my my
bookings in order to to accommodate
those how much do these cost you said
500 but is that what these cost no they
cost like 5,500 once everything's said
and 5500
okay six grand a piece okay and you're

[46:02]
okay six grand a piece okay and you're
ordering them because it's been going
and it's in Utah and the weather's
warming up and you want to grow your
business yeah right okay how have you
been finding customers so far 90% has
just been Google ads we've done quite a
bit of we're just cranking out cold
calls every single day doing a lot of
just like networking with Realtors and
moving companies but primarily Google
ads has been all of our we're starting
to get some traction with SEO
and we're starting to rank on like the
Google Map Pack so we've been making
some progress on those fronts but
primarily Google ads which is pretty
expensive I think we're spending about
200 a day on Google
ads and what is that are you able to
attribute it correctly so you know like
how much in Google ads equates to a
rental yeah so $200 in Google ads spends
usually can book me about one and a half
to two rentals a
day okay so we're talking 700,000 bucks
in Revenue somewhere around there yeah

[47:00]
in Revenue somewhere around there yeah
assuming that we can maintain that and I
think that'll yeah that that's the goal
for this year once I have those other
dumpsters come
in okay theoretically as you scale the
ad campaign it'll get less efficient but
it's also getting warmer so is it
reasonable to assume if you were to to
spend a thousand a day that it would
still be somewhat profitable as the
weather warms up but not as I would
think so the more I I increase the
budget I've already noticed like my cost
per clicks starts to go up a little bit
my conversions are a little bit more
expensive the nice part is as long as
I'm getting like one and a half to two
bookings a day that covers all of my
fixed costs so the vast majority of my
expenses are fixed like I've got to pay
a full-time office person full-time
driver my yard rentals ,200 bucks a
month my loans on the equipment so once
all that's covered my margins get
significantly better so even if my ad
spend efficiency goes down it would
still be worth it okay and what
percentage of your business is coming
from Google ads today

[48:00]
from Google ads today
90% okay so cold calls aren't yielding
much fruit yet they haven't we've been
cold calling primarily like roofers
remediation companies home builders and
no we haven't had any luck with it we've
probably done I don't know 200 300 cold
calls at this point a lot of them either
already have a dumpster guy that they're
using like already have a contract with
somebody that's set up so that's one
thing we've been running into we can try
and compete on price but a lot of these
guys have larger operations so they can
run at smaller margins are you willing
to tell me what your website is so I can
pull that up yeah it's. Co how easy is
it or hard to change the pricing on your
website on any given time yeah would
take two
minutes and it are you not concerned
about that would it not cause friction
with current customers or is it not a
big deal no we don't have very many
repeat customers most of them are like
one-off homeowners that are find us on
from a Google ad search or on the map
pack and are just booking one so we have
a couple repeat customers but okay do

[49:02]
a couple repeat customers but okay do
you know how much you compete with those
backer bags at Home Depot at all I don't
know how you measure that
but they're a lot smaller than what
you're renting I know that yeah yeah so
we have 20 cubic yard dumpsters so
they're pretty
large okay and are most of these
homeowners just doing like bathroom
remodels and stuff or is it bigger stuff
yeah a lot of them are either just like
garage cleanouts or some sort of smaller
renovation okay or a lot of them are
moving okay have you thought of trying
to partner with the junk hauling
companies in the area um I've given a
little bit of thought I actually called
a junk removal guy yesterday to see if
we could set up some kind of like a
referral program the larger junk hauling
like junk removal guys so you've got
like 1800 got junk and junk Kings and
those types of like franchise models
those guys have their own dumpsters that
they'll rent out on occasion the guy
that I talked to yesterday was midsize
so he doesn't have dumpsters but he said

[50:00]
so he doesn't have dumpsters but he said
usually if he gets somebody that's
requesting a dumpster he'll just try and
talk him into doing a junk removal job
and he can usually for a slightly higher
price than a dumpster will just go out
and a lot of those junk removal guys
work really cheap they don't seem to
make a ton of money so I think they're
willing to take a cut in price and make
it worth it for their customer have you
gone the handyman route and scraped a
list of handyman or general contractors
specifically more smaller ones to do
Outreach to them we haven't um most of
the people we've been reaching out to
are are larger companies like large
remediation because my first thought was
I want to land as big of a contract as I
can so mostly like larger remediation
Roofing and uh home builders but that
might I haven't really given that much
thought but that might be some uh lower
hanging
fruit yeah the the the hard part with
those guys is they can be some sometimes
hard to find a lot of those handymen and
contractors like they don't have a
website they're not even on Google Maps
they just get business from referrals
and yeah you know what I'm saying yeah

[51:02]
and yeah you know what I'm saying yeah
absolutely have you noticed on your
Google ads a time of day or week when
you're busier or slower like when is the
demand is it like on a Thursday before
the weekend or is there no correlation
there's a lot of correlation so
Wednesday Thursday Friday are wild like
today I've got I think four drop offs
yesterday we had two or three so
Wednesday Thursday Friday are crazy
Monday and Tuesday are pretty slow and a
lot of that is because I'm working
primarily with home owners that just
want a warm weekend where they can do a
garage clean out or tear down that deck
or whatever it is and that's one reason
why I do want to go the commercial route
a little bit more is because they're a
little bit more consistent if it's rainy
out they're not going to stop their
project or so that that's one thing we
it's very varies a lot between Monday
and Tuesday is dead and then Wednesday
Thursday Friday is just crazy to where
we we run out of dumpsters okay do you
have to rent these or could you sell
them as well sell the dumpsters yeah is
that even an option or is the margin not
there if I were to sell them it would
just be to like another dumpster

[52:02]
just be to like another dumpster
company or just a a commercial business
right that that needs an extra one
permanently yeah that have to go through
the trash company they would need
somebody to empty it I could sell it to
them and then just service it on a
monthly basis so usually like we've got
one guy up in Park City right now that
we have a monthly contract with so him
for example we charge 550 bucks a month
and that includes one empty and then if
he needs us to come out and empty it
before that we can do a swap for 200
bucks so those are usually how those
types of contracts work I'm sure I know
there's some people that will like
fabrication shops will buy a dumpster
that's for like metal recycling and then
somebody will come empty it for free but
primarily it's it's more of a a
rental and the guy in Park City what is
his use for this dumpster he does build
outs for commercial spaces so he's doing
like a a commercial buildout on the
shopping center right now okay so you're
you've been trying to find more guys
like him yeah the nice part about guys
like him and especially as we get more

[53:00]
like him and especially as we get more
dumpsters is like we've been having to
go the residential route right now
because we only have 11 dumpsters so we
have to turn these things really quickly
but the nice part about those commercial
guys is he takes the exact amount of
work as a residential person so for
example a lot of residential guys I'll
cut them a deal if they're doing like a
three-day booking and they'll pay
$299 this commercial guy he keeps the
dumpster for a month but he pays me 550
so it's the exact same amount of work
and the the additional 200 is just pure
profit the downside is I've got that
dumpster tied up so ideally what I could
do is over time shift more and more to
commercial as I get more equipment and
eventually that's primarily where I'd
like to be and then do some residential
jobs here and there but those jobs are
they're significantly more profitable
but if I only did commercial jobs I
wouldn't pay the bills because I'd be
booked out whereas with the the
residential jobs some of these dumpsters
I can turn two or three times a week so
it's more work but more
profit okay all all right I think I've
got some ideas think if you're spending
six grand a month and I don't know if

[54:01]
six grand a month and I don't know if
you think how I think but this is how I
think I I never want to hire an agency
for anything because I don't want to pay
one to four grand a month for anything
right but then I'll just I'll dump $200
a day into Google ads and it just seems
totally different to me and really it's
that's three agencies so yeah I don't
know if you think like that but I think
you would be pretty well served to find
uh a gmbb agency to organically increase
your M pack ranking over time and I feel
like you're in this for the Long Haul no
pun intended and you're willing to make
investments today to grow your business
six months from now which is why you
bought all these new dumpsters but I
think that would really help it's not
going to move the needle today but I
think a lot of these agencies are a th
to 1500 bucks a month and they work like
of all the agencies you could hire it's
a lot of times with any agency it's is
this guy is this even working but with
gmbb it's very clear you can see your
ranking improve on certain terms I would
try that there's a I've tweeted quite a

[55:00]
try that there's a I've tweeted quite a
bit about it if you do an advanced
search under my name for Home Service
I've tweeted quite a bit about improving
your map pack ranking and all that I
would try that I would also experiment
with surge pricing I would be willing if
I were you to really drop your prices
during those low demand times and see if
you convert a lot better directly from
Google that's the great thing about cold
traffic to a website is you can play
play around with your prices all you
want and no one's going to Care no one's
going to remember no one's going to Care
I've always wanted to buy a hotel just
so I could experiment with surge pricing
like to an extreme where it's like all
right I know that my cleaner is going to
take an hour to clean this room I pay
her 18 bucks an hour so my hard cost is
18 bucks all right our hotel is normally
130 a night but if I'm not 100% occupied
I'm going to charge 30 until someone
books CU then I have an email address
that I could Market to them every month
I still make a $10 profit because those

[56:02]
I still make a $10 profit because those
empty rooms are just throwing money away
yeah I would experiment with something
drastic like that where you even
increase the prices on the weekend and
maybe they convert the same and you drop
them like significantly just to learn
even if you're losing money during the
week when you know like realistically
I'm not going to get any conversions
today just play around with it and see
what if it works what do you think about
that yeah yeah I think that's a great
idea and then even if I'm breaking even
on a couple bookings on a Monday or
Tuesday and I get a shorter booking it's
better than them sitting in the yard
I've got these things they're like a
really bright blue color and they're all
decaled and everything so they're like a
moving billboard so if I could move him
around town and keep I've got my driver
there at the yard full-time anyways so
if I'm just trying to find things for
him to do he might as well be breaking
even on a delivery and that way we can
remarket to that person a lot of times
their neighbors will call based on the
so we've got it we've got like a QR code
and our phone number and everything
these dumpsters so they're like a moving

[57:00]
these dumpsters so they're like a moving
billboard so if we can I love it have
that added benefit and then also
remarket to that person and keep my guys
busy then I think that's a great idea
yeah I love that did you ever see that
Dollar Shave Club viral commercial from
10 years ago 15 years ago I've seen a
couple of them well it was the original
one it was the guy in the warehouse it's
really funny I would go use that as a
case study and put a little money into
making a 60-second video that you can
put right on your homepage of just you
something funny and endearing you
sitting in a dumpster or sitting on a
stack of dumpsters maybe right when they
arrive just like climbing up there
getting a video a very professional one
saying just what am I going to do with
all these dumpsters I've got 26
dumpsters or whatever like what am I
going to do with them and that's let
people see your personality right there
on the homepage and I I think that will
really help because this is a commodity
and it's man I could pay 400 bucks to
this commodity or I could pay 450 bucks

[58:00]
this commodity or I could pay 450 bucks
to Bailey and he seems cool and funny
and I like this guy yeah I I think that
would help conversion on your landing
page because if you're relying that much
on cold traffic then every little tweak
you make on your landing page is going
to make a big difference so you can play
around with keywords and all that stuff
inside of Google but I would focus more
efforts on your actual website to better
convert the traffic that gets there and
then I would take the efforts or money
or Manpower that you're spending on cold
calling and just divert that to more
digital efforts for at least a couple
weeks posting on next store posting in
local Facebook groups Buy Sell Groups
mom groups anything posting on KSL
Craigslist Facebook Marketplace and just
don't cold call for a while see how that
goes and but specifically tell your
story I'm a Utah entrepreneur and I put
all this money to drive to Texas and to
buy a tri truck and 11 dumpsters so I
could better serve the valley with

[59:00]
could better serve the valley with
dumpsters tell your story and people
will read it like they'll keep reading
to the end and then they'll feel like
they know you and they like you and it
it seems kitchy and like silly but I
promise you it works like when we do our
cold Outreach we tell our the story of
James my my tree Biz Operator just
graduated from college moved to Texas
started like people love it they want to
support you a person but if you're just
a business a faceless business I know
your fa is on the website which is
awesome I would do the same thing then
it's you're just any other dumpster
rental company yeah that is a great idea
I didn't even think of that but anybody
I've told that story because I I flew
out to Dallas and had to move all these
dumpsters around so they could get
shipped and put one on the back I'd
never driven anything more than a pickup
truck so I drove it 26 hours back to
Salt Lake anybody I've told that story
is pretty interested or think it's funny
or engaging so I that's not a bad idea
EX exactly yeah and then I would get I
would scrape a list of all the handymen

[1:00:00]
would scrape a list of all the handymen
General Contractors everything then you
can start doing cold Outreach to them
cold call text email going to their
website submitting a contact us form and
then just keep going the realtor and the
commercial realtor route for referrals
because I think you're on the right
track there I would just pause it for a
while to try these other things before
revisiting it yeah I think you'll find
success there awesome yeah those are
some great ideas I yeah you're a genius
thanks man I hope it helps and I I want
you to promise me that you'll follow up
in a month or two and tell us how it's
going absolutely yeah do you want me to
follow up by email or how email's great
and maybe we'll have you back on the
show okay excellent yeah I really
appreciate you taking the time I know
you've got a lot going on today I've
seen on your Twitter you're headed to a
a wedding today yeah yeah I'm
officiating it and I didn't even yeah
it's a whole thing but nice yeah thanks
again I really appreciate you taking the
time of course have a good day hey you
too thanks bye see you
