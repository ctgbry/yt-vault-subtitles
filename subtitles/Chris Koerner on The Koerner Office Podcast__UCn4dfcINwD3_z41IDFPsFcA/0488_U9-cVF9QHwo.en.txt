[00:00]
if placebos work even if you know
they're placebos then what's stopping
you from selling Placebo adderal did you
know that they have done Placebo tests
with knee surgery and it was just as
effective as like a placebo pill wow
that blows my mind second of all they've
done Placebo tests where they tell them
it's a placebo and it works just as well
that's crazy you're like a referral
agency you just Farm it all out train
your algorithm we're thoughtlessly like
letting the algorithms train us but
we've got to tell the algorithm what we
want and it'll show us
okay this is part two with me and Sam
talking all kinds of crazy ideas part
one was exactly a week ago today let me
know what you think another thing I
thought for our our tree triming
business is back to like the handyman
idea is like an insurance policy where
it's like hey 50 bucks a year $50 a year
which is relatively nothing and if a
storm happens there's a freeze branch
falls on your roof you're at the top of
our list right that's it and like even
if we don't make money on that 50 bucks
even if somehow we money like it

[01:01]
even if somehow we money like it
positions us as more of a priority in
their brain and we're already competing
with how many other home service
providers like not even it's not like
they have multiple tree trimming
providers but any contractor or vendor
that they or Merchant that they interact
with on a daily basis now we're just
like we're just a higher priority to
them and so when they're in an off-hand
conversation three months later about a
tree like if they don't pay that $50 a
year they probably don't think of us but
since they do they mention us you know
it's it's kind of an intangible that
that can move the needle I like that a
lot because then you're like yeah
recurring revenue is what most people
would see that and be like yeah we want
recurring Revenue I'm like dude I want
not not an LTV bump based on that
Revenue but an LTV bump based on the
more macro retention metric that that
creates of like you just stay top of
mind with them easier like yeah we've
already worked with these guys tree
trimming did a good enough job that we

[02:00]
trimming did a good enough job that we
want to use them again and so yeah like
we'll pay the 50 bucks a year there's a
whole other benefit so you can add
another layer to that and say you know
what I'll do you one more we're going to
stop by quarterly and just inspect your
trees because sometimes branches fall in
the tree but they don't hit the ground
and it's still you you know you might
not notice it but I'm looking for it I
am and what that does is it gives you an
excuse four times a year to upcharge or
to quote additional products or Services
right so we have a septic system at our
house cuz that's all that they have
where I live and there's you know the
Septic company that installed it tried
selling me on an annual plan just like
this and I said no for eight years one
day we had a big break it was like
$1,600 to fix and the guy comes all smug
and he's like you know if you would have
been on our maintenance plan this
wouldn't happened it's like how much is
it it's 200 a year okay eight years okay
so we're we broke even like I want math
on my side which I don't need to pay for
your plan okay but from his side it's a

[03:01]
your plan okay but from his side it's a
genius offering because so now we my my
wife made me buy it yeah like from here
on out we do we do pay for it yeah and
every quarter he comes here he's like oh
your sprinkler head's broken that's 240
bucks that's and I'm like I'm paying you
to quote me four times a year what a
scam that's what I was saying at the
beginning I was like dude like it just
as a you can sell it as an add-on
benefit whatever of like dude we just
like you're almost like an insurance
policy but it just gets you a guy on
site
schedule that they're happy to see that
like can you know you go get an extra
thousand do out of that customer a year
because the sprinkler head because this
because that so as a tree trimmer you
show up and it's like hey knock on the
door and you lead with good news you're
like hey good news you're in great shape
everything's good here you don't owe us
anything by the way we now offer Mulch
and I notice your mulch is getting kind
of old for 400 bucks we could knock that
out tomorrow what do you think okay so
talk to me about this could you do this
if you do not have a pre-existing home

[04:02]
if you do not have a pre-existing home
service business could you just
abolutely could you just launch the
maintenance right or like the how would
you even describe that dude it's like
get a third party's unbiased opinion on
what your home needs right and they come
out once a quarter like a referral
agency literally bro Farm it all out
literally just Farm out every single
thing to like your preferred vendors and
like almost like I had this idea a while
ago living where I live in LA there's a
lot of money here right sure and I think
that there's this need for what I want
to call like a family
concierge right like I think a lot of
people like the idea of having a
personal assistant and so like you would
have one person right that you'd give
them the phone number and say Hey you
pay 99 bucks a month you ever need to
schedule dry cleaning you ever need to
make a a reservation at a restaurant in
this area you ever need you know your

[05:01]
this area you ever need you know your
your oil CH whatever right like whatever
needs to go down for you to live your
life that we can remove some friction on
you pay us 99 bucks a month you just
text us whatever you need and then we
just farm that out to anybody else like
oh we need a new Gardener cool we've got
these three vendors here you go here's
their pricing do you want us to handle
that which like then you get into some
interesting stuff you get their credit
card on file you can pay for them you
can do some credit card Point AR like
there's things to do but like that model
of like Hey we're having issues with ab
and c and just just positioning the
middleman as a better offer right your
home concierge right like your whatever
whatever it turns into and just
middleman it up on a recurring and then
you get kickbacks from your referral
Partners or you control billing on the
top and you go to you know homeboy a and
say hey this guy needs new sprinklers
what's that going to cost they say 250
you go back to that guy and say it's 350

[06:00]
you go back to that guy and say it's 350
I just feel like there's a move there to
be like literally launching it as a
middleman in a local demo like that yes
I got an idea so so let's take two ideas
put them together yep so you take the go
Outdoors model $5 a yearly membership
and you go up to a household and you say
hey I own what would you even call this
like you don't want to say home warranty
because those have like a scanny
connotation some sort of like a
concierge right you said it conci that's
the only downside I know is I or an e
you know nobody knows scientists haven't
figured out yet yeah but basically what
we do we have two plans $0 a year and $5
a year okay hear me out we will stop by
every quarter in person like no BS we
will leave a note on your door to prove
that we were there and we're just going
to look around do you have pest do you
have any sort of issue do you have trees
hanging Roofing issue that's it and if
you pay $5 a year you're going to get
20% off any service through our vetted

[07:01]
20% off any service through our vetted
partner network if you don't pay $5 a
year no problem you can still call or
text us anytime you see or need
something and we'll stop by every
quarter the only thing that the $5 doll
gets you is a 20% discount on any
service so what that does is it just
gives you an excuse to stop by a quarter
and quote them something and farm it out
to you don't have to be an HVAC or a
plumbering guy you're just farming it
all out it plays on the same human
psychology like then when you're
when your faucet starts leaking it's
like oh you know what let's just call
that guy because I'm I'm paying $5 a
year or we're going to get a discount or
he's going to come anyway you're top of
mind I mean like I was doing it that
same sort of model digitally for a while
and still kind of do when I do
Consulting right it's like it's uh the
way that I've always described it is
like for me I say I'll play quarterback
for your growth right like I'm gonna
come in I'm going to look at your
business I'm going to look at all of the
different channels that could work might
work what the math looks like

[08:00]
work what the math looks like
and then I can provide vetted partners
for hey you need PPC this is where we
think we're going to see the most these
are the guys that I would go with and
just pump them there like I'm not doing
the actual PPC management but like
they're paying for my eyes and expertise
to then point them in the right
direction and I think that there's
specifically as some of the
commoditization happens across Digital
Services across whatever you want
somebody that can be there as the filter
a little bit more to be like hey are
these guys like there's 15 plumbing
companies that can come out and do your
septic right how do I know which one to
pick and being able to just pick up
somebody that like the phone and call
someone you trust to be like hey we're
having issues like who and just be like
these guys they do this here's why run
that and so I think applying that same
model over to a a non-digital business
is also super interesting and I think
it's very important that the first
couple times you stop by there's no
you're not quoting them anything you're

[09:00]
you're not quoting them anything you're
buying Goodwill right and then like on
the third quarter playing the long game
or else it's going like oh okay I see
what this is yeah but really all this is
is like this is the in-person equivalent
of like a paid ad on Facebook or
Instagram it's right and what we're
doing is we're just like you know what
you're competing like every vendor in
the world is competing for your
attention I'm just going to pay a little
bit of money to to be higher up the
priority list right it's going to be job
spouse kids church Sports they're at the
very top and then it's like Kohls maybe
you shop at coals every week or Target
or Whole Foods at Walmart they're right
there I want to be just below that just
at the top of the mind when when
anything happens inside or around your
house I'm just paying a little bit of
money or in this case charging a little
bit of money to be more top of Mind than
I am today yeah I think that's the move
dude like and there's so much you can do
from an autom like there's so many ways
that you can lever that up to make it so
efficient right like when I think about

[10:02]
efficient right like when I think about
like the quarterly check-in right it's
like you just build a massive I don't
know the last time that you've moved in
or out of an apartment right but like
when you move in you they give you a
piece of paper and it has like a list of
all of these things that like you have
to confirm are good in the apartment or
like and then when you move out they do
the same list about like Hey we're going
to use the security deposit because
there's you mounted a TV on the wall and
tore the the drywall out and so if you
do that right but it's six pages once a
quarter we come out we fill all this in
with notes and all of the things and
like here's resources on how to we
notice your grass is a little dry we
don't think you need to hire someone to
fix it yet here's some things that you
know chat GPT please send us an email
with five recommendations for keeping
your grass green right like here's our
top five tips for this it'll it'll drop
your cost on maintaining the home
because you don't need to HDE right like
there's so many different ways to run
that you know what I mean oh yeah AI has

[11:00]
that you know what I mean oh yeah AI has
got to play a role there has to so I've
gotten sucked into like the DIY
algorithm on Instagram okay yeah yeah
and some of these videos okay here's an
example this woman took a bunch of paper
scraps and she put them in a bowl put
water in them got like an immersion
blender and made like a papier-mâché and
used like these little just household
items things that everyone has around
the house to make a moon and then she
put like an LED lighting strip around it
and put it on her wall and it looks like
the most incredible moon ever with
craters and Super Hyper realistic same
color and everything these videos get
like 60 million views and it's literally
just a craft that a mom made in her
house and she's monetizing with like an
Amazon store with like 2% affiliate
links why isn't there anyone out there
and if there is please show them to me
that's like just training the algorithm
to show you these things and then
Building Products and pushing building

[12:01]
Building Products and pushing building
products of these and pushing them with
paid ads right what are we doing or
turning the DIY video into a plan a PDF
and selling on an Etsy for 1995 right or
just like doing I mean we talked about
this when I was in Dallas like neon
Bears was that right was like oh I go
did I did it like and granted like you
know me slinging acrylic I don't have I
don't have one around here but like
acrylic Bears was just not at the top of
my priority list you know with the 30
employees you know but it it sold units
dude on a on a on a solo drop Lander
that I just like sniped internet photos
to do like and so I think there's like I
think there's there's opportunity in
that it goes back to that that other
episode which people should go and watch
is just like there are other people
promoting products that they just aren't
selling the product on the back end but
the videos are going viral right
papier-mâché AB andc I mean the cooking
dude like

[13:00]
dude like
somebody somewhere is going to stack an
absolute bag off of selling digital
cookbooks and I just haven't seen it yet
oh I got something to talk about here
like the cooking videos that have taken
Instagram by the neck every other video
I see or that Lauren sends me is a
cooking video for the air fryer for the
F they're all bangers and it's like
these people aren't selling anything
they're not selling a cookbook of all
it's like bro like I'm just going to
take your video I'll give you credit
that's fine but like it's all going to
go to the cookbook that I'm putting
together or like a niche content site or
like an IOS app or a Microsoft you know
what I mean little software like oh like
you know like there's Ops there that I
think are super interesting and it's all
just like the market is already telling
you what you want bro like you can see
the like count on the video you know
that chicken picata air fry recipe has

[14:02]
that chicken picata air fry recipe has
you know 500,000 people that are
interested in cooking it and it's like
all right cool you picata be kidding me
you got you picata be kidding me
dog dude all right all right I got a
bunch of ideas yeah so first of all chat
GPT is replaced like I like to cook it
has replaced any of those dumb recipe
blogs that are have so many ads dude
it's like thank you for the recipe the
last thing I need to know is about your
daughter's thirdd grade class day I
don't care that this is your husband's
favorite meal after a hard day of mowing
the lawn 18 paragraphs later maybe we
get to the ingredient list then maybe we
get to the instructions after six
autoplay video ads the that's the only
it's the worst way to monetize with all
these ads you cannot read what you're
doing so I'm done like that phase of my
life lasted 36 years and I'm past it
yeah just last night I want I got some
deer meat I shot a couple deer I want to

[15:02]
deer meat I shot a couple deer I want to
cook up some taco meat with my deer meat
and did you know that side note the
number one ingredient on taco seasoning
is corn starch like it's all filler yeah
it's cornstarch plus some seasoning it's
a joke yeah like it's full of carbs like
seasoning should not be full of carbs
and so I don't remember like back in the
day when I was on keto I had my own taco
seasoning when I say my own I mean one I
ripped from those stupid blogs but last
night I just open up chat GPT and I'm
like give me a seasoning recipe and then
I looked at my Tupperware container that
I wanted to put it in and I saw it was
2.9 cups so I thought I'm going to leave
a little space in there and I said make
sure it the final result is 2.5 cups
worth of seasoning boom gives it to me
immediately awesome and then I start
putting this together and I see dang the
number one ingredient is chili powder
and I hardly have any chili powder left
so I said hey Whip me up a new recipe
substitute out the chili powder so I
asked for a chili powder substitute and
it went a step further and
reincorporated the substituted items

[16:01]
reincorporated the substituted items
into the original recipe for me with the
math and everything so that's cool but
like I'm never going to go to a mom blog
and read a recipe ever again it's a only
these are the iOS things that I'm
talking about like that's the iOS play
that I want is is chat GPT rappers
around specific use cases like that
well-branded super simple and Twitter
Bros will tell you there's no business
there because people just use chat GPT
and I'm going to say I don't believe you
there's 8 billion people on the planet I
don't need to get all of them to be a
customer here no you get you get billion
thousand people a thousand people at
69.99 a year 70,000 bucks recurring
Revenue all right if you are watching
this clip right now you are watching
this on YouTube and if you are a fan of
podcast please check out my podcast
while you're at it because sometimes I
have podcasts that aren't on YouTube and
sometimes I have YouTubes that aren't on
podcast so check out the Kerner office

[17:00]
podcast so check out the Kerner office
on any podcast platform or you can go to
TKO pod.com also my newsletter will
throw that in there there are no ads
It's weekly it's different content than
my podcast and YouTube newsletter.
chrisj cerner.com You'll see the link
and we'll see you there like on
autopilot for what a chat GPT rapper
what's your positioning no stupid mom
blog Preamble no ads no no autoplay
videos that's it it's the anti what
everyone's used to straight up straight
up the other piece too is like I've been
thinking about like GPT rappers are
super interesting I think you know
there's there's a few of like Niche use
cases of plant identification or like
right like all these little things I'm
just gonna say this out loud someone can
steal my idea dude I want to launch an
app I just want to call it pastor and I
just wanted to be a I know right I just
want it to be a like a Bible study
partner right like you can go in and
like have a conversation with a pastor
that's AI
right and you got to remove the vowels

[18:01]
right and you got to remove the vowels
it's just got to be PST
P anyway keep going but like there's
stuff like that that I feel like again
like you're talking about massive Market
you're not trying to sell them a $3,000
program you know what I mean it's like
you're trying to get them to sign up for
60 bucks a year and I just think that
that world with markets of that
size are interesting like dude and it
remembers the notes you take on certain
scriptures you read and then 6 months
later it's like oh you took a note
similar to this in John you chapter 7
right and you start layering in
additional additional functionality of a
daily Bible study uh journal or like
accountability partner right like did
you say your prayers today you know yeah
like no you're going to hell you know
what I mean
like I don't know on the door yeah
literally but I think there's just stuff
like that yeah I don't know I know I
just think there's there's a world where

[19:00]
just think there's there's a world where
there's so much if you're listening to
this and you want to build an IOS app
like I will fund that spe like that one
specifically just because I I I mean I
have that send prayers Instagram account
that's at 13,000 followers just on
posting like Christian music is it still
posting stuff yeah I mean I got to go
refill the coffers every once in a while
but like right I'm like yeah I'm in can
AI watch and understand videos right now
like if I upload a real can it tell me
exactly what's going going on I think so
I've never tried it because obviously it
can do videos potentially a downloaded
version dude you mentioned plant
identification I'm a tree guy I like
trees right and I had this Oak Tree in
my backyard and I was like what is this
and I knew they had apps that did it I
never had one on my phone so I look at
the apps they all cost money but they
all have a s-day trial free trial I
download the app I identify it it's a
scrub Oak cool then I delete the app
because I ain't paying for that right
now you know I'm identifying trees all
day every day because it's free in chat
GPT yeah guess what those plant

[20:00]
GPT yeah guess what those plant
identification apps they're doing great
they're doing just fine fine they are
doing just fine and they haven't changed
anything on their back end either they
don't need to they great just a perfect
example of how no rapper is too stupid
well it's just to be B yeah well the the
the thing that that I had to break this
pattern of for myself was really like
selection bias was like when you think
what's the what's that book Crossing the
chasm right like they talk about early
adopters and they talk about right like
and then you get to the mass market and
and all of that I realized that me and
everybody that I'm around which like is
a a broad stroke on like Twitter right
specifically these are early
adopters yeah like and proximity bu yeah
like I have to reference check like one
of my one of my best friends here I grew
up with him we went to kindergarten
together like he is he's on Twitter but
he's not or my sister right like my
sister dude like she doesn't use chaty
BT like I don't know like anyone in real

[21:00]
BT like I don't know like anyone in real
life that's on Twitter I don't know what
it I don't know how they have 200
million daily active users because I
don't know any of them and so we just
sit in this world of selection bias of
like oh these people have already done
this oh like it's just CHT it's it's
like no dude like I promise I promise
that you can just go put out an offer
and like 99% of the markets they're not
even they're not even going to look at
your plant identification app and be
like oh this is just a chat GPT rapper
you and I know that
yeah you and I see all these apps and we
go oh this is a fugazi you know like
like it's a fugazi but like the market
the market has no idea what's going on
like they just think that it's that's
what the app does they're like oh they
built this thing take it a step further
and do a side by-side Google Trends
comparison two two Search terms chat GPT
and perplexity okay you and I know
perplexity it's a household name it's
like a 20th of the search is chat GPT so

[22:00]
like a 20th of the search is chat GPT so
why not build a perplexity rapper right
and then you can even sell to the people
on Twitter they're not even talking
about perplexity no it's like they don't
even know dude it's like go go ask go
ask the guy that's bagging your
groceries at the store later what
perplexity is and he's like dude a drug
I don't know like what are you talking
about that he'd buy our app but he would
he'd be like dude I want to be able to
identify the tomatoes in my garden you
know dude I I keep getting distracted
from the original idea of like a
papermache moon thing and that's not the
idea it's just the idea of I love like
the other guy asked this guy asked me so
I'm doing my call-in segments again
right but it's different in that people
can record a voicemail and then I play
it so they're not live they can't keep
asking questions very uh limited and
this one guy called in and he's like hey
I want to do what you're doing on social
media like talk about business ideas but
in Canada so it's totally different I
would never compete with you I'm like
dude do you know how the internet works
yeah I was like the internet is the

[23:01]
yeah I was like the internet is the
internet but he's like I just have one
question we are one nation under
Elon it's like I just have one question
where do you get your ideas from like
where do you Source them I'm like dude I
get them from Instagram it's I just
train the algorithm and so that's a
whole other framework is like train your
algorithm like do I like watching
theovon videos absolutely but not on
this account if I see theovon come
across it's like not today Satan
get out no like no bookmark no share
with nickit I'm swiping away if I see
someone making a paper mâché Moon I'm
going to bookmark I'm going to comment
I'm GNA like I'm GNA you're just
training the algorithm but we're
thoughtlessly like letting the
algorithms train us but if we really
want to learn or see these Niche things
we've got to tell the algorithm what we
want and it'll show us that's what I do
on I have three different accounts and I
train them all in three different things
you have to and my personal account is a
lot of theovon for sure but like the
other ones aren't here's what you do you
go find the 5050 million view

[24:01]
go find the 5050 million view
papier-mâché Moon video yep okay upload
it to Chad GPT you say I know you don't
really know what's going on here but I
want you to come up with a plan to make
this clearly and you can describe it you
give it some help it's paper mchet
they're putting in a bowl immersion
blender but I don't know what does the
moisture content need to be they've got
little bottle caps to make the craters
what size bottle like I need varying
bottle caps so you need a milk jug you
need a 2 lit bottle like I want you to
write this out
10 seconds later you've got a plan
export the PDF log into Etsy sell it
1995 alongside the video but we're not
done we're not done Sam okay and I I'm
gonna start calling you California Sam
okay because you got you've got the
California voice and I think it just
works okay thank you that's a compliment
and so then you you go to the creator of
the video who's not monetizing it at all
and you say hey I love your paper mâché
Moon I love it so much I'm going to sell
it on Etsy but you know what I want I

[25:00]
it on Etsy but you know what I want I
want to give you 25% of all those sales
I noticed you haven't posted it since
May did you know that you can safely
when I say safely I mean it will get
just as much if not more engagement you
can safely simply repost you just hit
repost that's it any piece of content
and no one will remember it and most
creators don't even know that like it
has to be new it has to be fresh you can
safely repost that but this time you're
going to put a link in the bio or you're
going to put a many chat automation that
leads to my my Etsy listing and you're
going to get $5 every time it sells and
all you have to do is hit bro the many
chat the many chat like if you were just
gosh I know it's brilliant it's many
chat is your answer that's it you're
you're your or post the story yeah like
find yeah like you go find products that
you think you can sell on Etsy Amazon
direct whatever doesn't matter like
whatever it is you go to them and say
hey we got this thing you're just going
to send this is your script you already
have this video
all you need to do is say comment X and

[26:01]
all you need to do is say comment X and
I'll send you my guide product kit B
whatever they do that you set up you own
the many chat automation on the back and
you just
go all pushing towards that product and
you could do that times a million
creators and a million products like all
you're doing is just trying to identify
Trends spin up products products to
fulfill that quickly and then you're
just managing that's dude some like
you're a middleman like you just like I
love being a middleman the crapped on
title in the world and I'm here for it
hire me as everybody is a middleman bro
put me on your middleman payroll okay
everybody's a middleman quick plug I do
have a Min chat affiliate link with a
discount in the show notes U I got to I
got to but dude here's the everyone
wants step-by-step plan step number one
create a new Instagram account or
Instagram has a new feature by the way
Sam where you can reset the algorithm
did you know that no that's button reset
it okay so go on Instagram reset the

[27:02]
it okay so go on Instagram reset the
algorithm and just start training it
start searching for things right DIY DIY
whatever whatever it is train it train
it like bookmark create a bookmark
folder with all these things okay then
you're going to go use my many chat
affiliate link sign up and you're going
to get a keyword then you're going to
upload that video to chat GPT it's going
to tell you what's happening it's gonna
it's going to spit you out like two
pages worth but you need more than that
you need volume so then you're going to
say Chad gbt go to step three and I need
you to elaborate on that go to step four
I need you to elaborate that on that
repeat over and over until you have like
a 17-page PDF go to Etsy create an
account have your mom and grandma buy
something to leave you a festar review
push some paid ads to it to get some
more reviews get some traction you want
to put that video front and center on
your Etsy listing and then you're going
to reach out to the Creator she probably
won't respond because if she has a video
with 50 million views she probably has a
ton of DMS but you're going to find her
on any other platform and I promise you
he or she will respond on one of the
platforms it's just a numbers game
people do it to me they will copy and

[28:01]
people do it to me they will copy and
paste the same message and I do respond
to them that doesn't mean I want you to
do this if you're listening but it works
and then you're gonna say hey all I need
you to do just hook a brother up with a
swipe up on my story with papier-mâché
moon or with moon or with anything and
you're going to get five bucks every
time it sells and you won't have to do
anything why aren't we doing this 50
million views that equals demand guess
what Etsy PDF equals worldwide sales
yeah no shipping no fulfillment yeah
game over what are we doing dude what
are we doing dude I need a nap I know I
need eight more hours a day I need
another Peach
aani dude with that I had to switch to
the non-caffeinated
oh drink thoughts and prayers dude it's
so good bro what is it
NOCO amino acids I just had an idea did
you know that I I'm fascinated with
placebos okay first of all did you know

[29:00]
placebos okay first of all did you know
that they have done Placebo tests with
orthoscopic knee surgery and it was just
as effective as like a placebo pill wow
F they fake the surgery yes they go they
go under and you wake up and you're like
you're good and they'll put like a cast
on their leg they'll make it seem like
they they didn't do anything and they
were fine and the results were the same
like that blows my mind second of all
did you know that they've done Placebo
test where they you know control group a
they got they got Group B Group B is the
placebo and they tell Group B here's
your pill it is a placebo which like
breaks every rule in the book right
here's your Placebo wait what yeah we're
we're trying something new same effect
that's crazy they tell them it's a
placebo and it works just well well so
that was my thought that I just had as
you said the first one I was like dude
I'm I'm launching Phantoms surgery.com
you just come on in here dude we'll just
going give you a little laughing assas
call today you don't need to be a

[30:01]
call today you don't need to be a
licensed doctor if you're not actually
doing anything I'm not that's what I'm
saying like I'm just going to put an
operating room in the back of a box
truck and call it a
debt but in all seriousness that would
be an important part of it is making it
seem and feel and lookit right yeah it's
it's a set it's a it's a fake it's a
fake jet for sure it's got to feel real
so I was thinking could you build a
business around around placebos right
like here's here's the thing here's the
thing I mean works even if they know
it's Placebo then generally you would
say yeah okay tell me if I'm unethical
parent for even thinking about this so I
haven't done this but I'm seriously
considering it two of my four kids show
like serious signs of ADHD wonder where
they got that from probably my wife
right yeah yeah yeah definitely
definitely on her her bloodline over
there it's from her anyway and they're
not medicated they're both extremely
smart they're in gifted and talented
programs but heard that like it really
doesn't become a problem until age like

[31:01]
doesn't become a problem until age like
10 12 right got it and they're not
really there yet but like no parent
wants to like look for an excuse to give
their kids pills myself included yeah
but yeah I'm good but like if I find
that it genuinely improves their quality
of life I'm willing to do that we just
would rather exhaust other options first
right what about this what if I go on
Amazon I order some sugar pills and I
put them in a bottle see this looks just
like this and I can even put a label on
it it like Aderall it's literally a
sugar pill and I go to my kid and I say
hey and they don't you know I'm not
sitting down with a doctor they don't
know any better it's like hey clearly
you're struggling with your homework
your dad has ADHD these pills really
help and I think they could help you
it's a very small dose and I think it'll
help and then give my kid a sugar pill
and see if it works what do we think is
that completely like am I about to get
canceled is this it is this me because I
haven't done this to be clear I've never
done this yeah yeah m

[32:00]
no I'm I'm with that I think in an
interesting way have you seen tabs the
sex chocolate yes I think it's so
similar it's the same thing there's
nothing going on in there right there's
not it's not anything other than the
fact that you and your partner have both
opted in
to that says we are about to get hot and
heavy down here you know and so then
like you just get your brain into being
you know whatever whatever
vernacular yeah it's like you're looking
for it so you find we're doing it you
know it's like yeah we're going to have
this before and then it's like it
doesn't not that it doesn't but like I
mean come on you know what I'm saying
it's good marketing period end of story
it's phenomenal marketing and I'm not
I'm not mad at it okay right am I a
customer no am I mad at good marketing
that might be a little misleading no
dude I might be a customer bro
Mohamad I that

[33:00]
Mohamad I that
out anyway you could build a b a brand
around the placebo effect for sure why
not just call it placebos if placebos
work even if you know they're placebos
then what's stopping you from selling
Placebo Aderall could I was GNA say
could you put that on the website like
Aderall like on be like dude that would
sued by would you if you if you disclaim
it as a placebo I'm just saying like the
the trademark ader all like you sure
sure sure but like you know yeah you fly
close to you get in trouble for saying
outright this is actually not a med this
is a sugar pill but it's a placebo for
ader all and we just referenced the
studies that you talked about that's
like even these guys knew that it was a
placebo and it still had positive impact
you're not putting anything in your body
other than half a gram of sugar once a
day and your cost on that is zero like
I'm not zero but like Cs on that is your

[34:00]
I'm not zero but like Cs on that is your
packaging is the most expensive part
yeah like your cogs on that is like what
$4 if Max sell it for 28 well dude if
you if you ship pills in like we're
talking about shipping pills here this
is really devolved if you ship pills in
like an envelope like not in a pill
bottle you're paying the cost of a stamp
so shipping is flat pack yep it has to
be under a quarter inch and that would
be while you look for that by way of
backstory to the listeners Andor
Watchers there it is there it is yep
toss that in dude I had stopped
recording and we were talking about the
drink he was drinking and it looks like
an energy drink but it has no caffeine
and I'm like what are you doing like who
doesn't drink caffeine and he's like
well it still has the vibe of caffeine
then we started talking about placebos
and I had to hit record again so this is
like an encore it's like an idea Encore
an idea Encore I mean I feel like when I
crack this thing open I get excited for
the next two hours of my life very
similar impact outside of the fact that

[35:02]
similar impact outside of the fact that
caffeine has a biological indicator but
I was feeling before we got on this pod
I was on back toback calls for four and
a half hours I was feeling a little
rundown I took a shower I went and
grabbed this and I was like let's get
after it and then we popped on and ship
off the R's G to be run down on the TKO
pot us just not going to happen
especially when you have a placebo in
your hand thanks for listening and or
watching to the ker office we'll see you
next time
