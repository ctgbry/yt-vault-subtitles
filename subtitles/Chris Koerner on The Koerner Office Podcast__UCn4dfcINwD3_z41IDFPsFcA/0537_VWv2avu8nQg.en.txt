would you look at this freaking thing
right here you know I think this should
be a viral product that you need to sell
look at how much money is spent around
the United States on game day at
tailgate it's crazy in fact in college I
had a job for a company named game day
tents in Tuscaloosa Alabama that rented
out 10x10 tents for $1,500 for one day
you can't tell me if you developed a
product that mimic what's going on with
this shopping cart right here and bought
a ticket to a football game just to walk
that thing around with a dozen more in
the back of your trucks you can't tell
me you wouldn't sell all 12 of those you
absolutely would look at how many views
this video has that's demand look how
many heads this product is turning
that's demand the people at this
tailgate are not price sensitive they
want to be different unique and stand
out they want to turn heads too so put
your butt in a metal shop build a few of
these and go sell them next football
season get my full business plan right
here
