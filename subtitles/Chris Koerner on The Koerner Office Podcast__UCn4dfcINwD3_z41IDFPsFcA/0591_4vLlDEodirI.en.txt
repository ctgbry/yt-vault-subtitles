look at this freaking guy right here
this dude literally sets hats on fire on
purpose and somehow people still pay
beep for them and that's not even the
craziest part let me tell you what these
hats are how much they cost how much
this guy makes per year and how you can
copy them day 56 of Genius business
ideas follow for more so this guy wasn't
always a hat maker he was an engineer a
goalkeeper and a soccer player before he
quit everything to make hats by hand
these hats take him hundreds of hours to
make and when you find out how much they
cost you're going to be shocked he's not
charging enough he makes each hat from
scratch using rabbit and beaver felt
these are the opposite of mass produced
he uses old school steaming sanding and
molding techniques that took him years
to learn and if he can't find the right
tool he'll build the tool himself his
first hat molds were actually handcarved
by his dad his biggest supporter because
the real hat making equipment was too
expensive for him this dude is obsessed
what a case study in what Obsession can
bring Obsession equals happiness equals
profits he broke countless fingernails
fighting the fabric he'd work for tens
of hours at a time forgetting to eat and
his hats take up to 5 months to make
people are waiting in line these hats
