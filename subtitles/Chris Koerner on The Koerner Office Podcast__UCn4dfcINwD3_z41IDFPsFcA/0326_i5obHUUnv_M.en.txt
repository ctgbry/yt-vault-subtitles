you guys have to see what I found this
is a fully automated cotton candy
vending machine profit margins are
literally 97% this is a brilliant
business because it's so visual the
cotton candy is made at the eye level of
the child so as the machine owner you
want those videos to go viral and as the
parent of the child that wants the
cotton candy you're going to buy it for
them a $10 serving of cotton candy cost
30 cents in Sugar then how much you can
make from these machines these machines
have to be cleaned every 100 servings
you have to restock the supplies about
every 150 servings liability insurance
is about $100 to $150 a month and the
best thing you can do is secure the
location before you buy the machine
visiting in person is the most effective
these machines make between $2 and
$10,000 a month and they cost about
$7,500 to $9,500 up front get the full
