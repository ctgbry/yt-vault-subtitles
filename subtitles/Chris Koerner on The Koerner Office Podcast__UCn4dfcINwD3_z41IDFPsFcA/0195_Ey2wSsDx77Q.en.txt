[00:00]
you could go find a high value audience
like real estate agents and you could
use cold emailing software like lemlist
mixmax gmass whatever scrape their
emails and send cold emails to them
you're not opting them into a newsletter
or a list you're sending cold emails to
them that says hey first name I know
you're a realtor here in city name I
have this newsletter we just talked
about the real estate market here in
city name would you mind if I send it
every week and you're just sending
manual cold emails with three automated
follow-ups asking them if you can
subscribe them and it sounds tedious but
it's all automated and then anytime they
say yes you connect that to zapier and
you opt them in to your beehive to your
[Music]
newsletter welcome to the ker office it
is Friday and you know what that means
that means it's time for hold cob Bros
and this was one of my favorite hold cob
Bros ever and I'm not just saying that
so you'll listen I'm saying that because
we talked about like eight different
business ideas that are all in different
niches and I think you're going to love

[01:00]
niches and I think you're going to love
a lot of them we talked about building a
local newsletter and how that
opportunity is open to anyone in the
world we talked about our friend doing
it in Maryland with his numbers we talk
about building a high value more Niche
newsletter by asking people to opt into
it through cold email we talked about a
bunch of Botox ideas partnering with
people that can provide Botox services
in parties and in the neighborhoods we
talked about building a business around
lifetime warranty as your unique value
proposition your uvp we talked about
starting a local Google my business
agency charging 1,500 bucks a month and
we talked about reverse engineering Etsy
finding bestselling products by looking
at reviews on Etsy it was a lot we
talked about a lot and I think you're
gonna love it so enjoy and we'll see you
next time all right I got an idea for
you let's do it do you remember a month
or two ago when we were talking about
partnering with influencers to launch
businesses and I said if someone is an
influencer and all they do is sell
t-shirts they don't know business yes
okay yeah I've used that line many times
with people now well thank you there was

[02:00]
with people now well thank you there was
one exception I don't really want to get
into but I forgot to mention it because
it proves you wrong I get it virginity
rocks you familiar with them no look the
guy the guy sells a virginity rocks
shirt oh is it the video where he's like
virginity Danny Duncan Danny Duncan I
don't know he's a viral social media
character I don't know but this guy
makes like $70 million a year from
selling virginity rocks merch and that's
his whole brand from the Christians who
were like oh brother brother sister
Smith have you seen the virginity Rock
sweatshirt oh I think that's such a good
message to send to the
children yes yes7
million come again that's what she said
that's a lot yeah like 70 million a lot
of money more than 50 yeah on t-shirts
and and hoodies and hats so like there
there are exceptions to that but oh my
that's like his gosh his whole brand
right and when you get it right it

[03:00]
right and when you get it right it
becomes its own viral effect you see a
shirt you buy a shirt well you know what
they say what's up sex
sells but what about lack
of I knew you'd get it my
friend lack of sex cells too apparently
lack of sex cells to everybody needs an
opposite a ying and a Yang if you will
there you go there you go so I don't
want to get into that too much but I
thought of another idea of how anyone
listening to this could make money by
Piggy backing on an influencer okay okay
there's a guy on Twitter that I follow
and his name is Sawyer Merritt and he's
probably going to get hit up after this
podcast but Sawyer is a Tesla Fanboy
that's his whole stick Elon responds to
his tweets frequently he tweets about is
he a big account
73,000 you ever heard of it yeah so he
tweets about all the Elon companies and
products and that's his whole shtick and
it's actually kind of like a crypto twe

[04:00]
it's actually kind of like a crypto twe
account it's quite easy to grow a Tesla
Twitter account because the algorithm
favors it and it's such a polarizing
topic it's so polarizing you love it or
you hate it right and so by nature of
that it's fairly easy to grow a Tesla
account anyway he sells t-shirts that's
like his monetization strategy is he has
a Shopify store that sells like
eco-friendly clothing and I I don't know
I didn't do the research I don't know
how much money it does but it can't be
much it can't be much
I think someone needs to partner with
this guy and launch a newsletter and
take those emails from his e-commerce
store and have them start tweeting about
it and launch a a free newsletter to
start of just like weekly Tesla news and
updates right these are high ticket
buyers it's a highly educated audience
and he's not monetizing with a
newsletter so you start with a free
newsletter and then month or two later
you launch a paid newsletter where you
launch you basically do kind of like a
Seeking Alpha or a mly fool like an

[05:01]
Seeking Alpha or a mly fool like an
in-depth deep dive on one of elon's
stocks right and it's like you need to
buy it you need to short it you know we
flew this drone over the factory and we
can see there's a production run being
withheld like all this Insider info you
just need to find one Rider give them a
cut of your revenue and it's like once a
month maybe it's 50 bucks a month $500 a
month depending on where you want to go
with it but people can trade based on
your newsletter and these are people
that are already buying his stocks
anyway he has 73,000 followers what do
we think I think it's I think it's a
genius way to take advantage of the
influencers and their distribution
Channel I think that's amazing because
he's not about to do this right no he's
busy I think a lot of times people have
the fear of reaching out to guys like
this and then just giving them the idea
like oh they're just going to go do it
themselves no they're not he's probably
already has a half a dozen other plans
in the works right now so in general I
love the idea of finding guys like him
that don't just have audience but that

[06:00]
that don't just have audience but that
have smaller more high value audiences
and partner with them to launch a
newsletter it could be a financial
newsletter maybe not yeah or looking at
these influencers and saying okay what's
their product audience fit and like if
you have an idea of all right this would
be perfect for this person's audience
then going to them and partnering to
sell that this also reminds me of do you
you know who Ryan sneen
is I had him I had him on my podcast
nickon nomics anyways he does Micro
newsletters one of the things that I was
like as I was talking to him I thought
would be interesting is going out and
identifying regionally influen Regional
influencers I guess is probably the best
way to say it so there's probably people
in Dallas who are really big about the
Dallas scene there's probably people in
Seattle or I know there's people in
Boise or there's people in s whatever
these big cities where they have like
big poll in those specific cities

[07:00]
big poll in those specific cities
and going to them and implementing a
newsletter for them effectively what
Ryan does and he does in
Anapolis I think there's like I want to
say there's like 85,000 people that live
in Annapolis and 45,000 of them are on
his newsletter yeah
yep but what he's done is he's
effectively turned it into a newsletter
that's the local
newspaper and so people place a bunch of
ads and and he makes great money placing
ads in his newsletter and so he could go
to these Regional influencers who are
already kind of in the know they know a
lot of people in those markets offer to
launch a newsletter for them that
Aggregates a lot of the information that
their followers are already interested
in so like Amy Nicks is it Amy Nicks or
Amy Knox inas Nixon yeah yeah Amy Nixon
where it's like you know she's real
estate and she's Dallas where it's like
okay cool Amy you're going to be the the
real estate the Dallas real estate
person and every week we're going to
talk about the changing market
conditions we're going to talk about the
inventory that's sold we're going to
talk about how days to sale we're going

[08:00]
talk about how days to sale we're going
to talk about average list price in each
one of these markets etc etc and you put
together that newsletter for her she
sends it out she owns a distribution and
then you own the cut whatever you
negotiate with her of that newsletter so
very similar to the way you're talking
about doing a newsletter for Tesla this
would be like geographically specific to
different regions of influencers like so
I like that approach that's a an amazing
idea amazing idea there's a guy there's
a a YouTuber there's a Dallas realtor
that is a YouTuber and his whole stick
is real estate in DFW and he has 20
30,000 subscribers and that's all he
does right he's not yeah he's not gonna
start a he's not gonna start a
newsletter right no why would he dude
our friend Sam I don't want to say his
last name because I don't know if he
wants to me talking about this but he
started a local newsletter in California
and he's acquiring subscribers with paid
ads 60 cents each he's not monetizing
but get this his long-term 10-year
20-year play is to be become the mayor

[09:00]
20-year play is to be become the mayor
of that town really and he wants to
vertically integrate his newsletter into
being the mayor one day dude that what
was crazy about talking to Ryan is he
was like I'm in the no the Chamber of
Commerce knows me he's like I go around
town and people recognize me any
restaurant that I want to get in and
have a car like to get a seat at I get a
table at and it's Anapolis Maryland so
it's like a nice town it's high income
but now he's also like I'm buying a
porta potty not Porta business yeah it's
a port body business it's a wedding
bathroom yeah like the L luxury bathroom
rental and I'm like dude now with your
connections you could go to the city you
could go to the local University you
could go to the Naval Academy and be
like you guys know who I am oh yeah of
course can I put a bid in for this yeah
of course like just by virtue of the
fact that you're the guy in town he's
gonna have so many business
opportunities that come his way but it's
because he created this effective
audience locally this micro audience I
mean you could get AI to write these too

[10:01]
mean you could get AI to write these too
you could just say hey take all the
local news from an from Annapolis I I
think if you're partnering with
influencers it makes more sense to do
this but if you're doing it yourself it
makes more sense for you to write it I
agree with that Ryan was saying that
it's hard to do it with AI because the
information he provides is so Market
specific and he felt like his brand was
built
around the like quirky personal
personalized newsletter but to that end
like that's where I'm like like okay you
find the local influencer and you find a
local writer cool and then you manage
the process like guess this isn't a hard
game that we're playing like okay here
are his numbers I just went and found it
2023 what would you he's got 85,000
people that live in
Anapolis 40,000 of them I think I'd have
to go look at the I think it's 40,000
46% of his town are subscribed geez
Louise all right so 85,000 let's just
say 40,000 are subscribed what do you
think he did in Revenue last year no

[11:02]
think he did in Revenue last year no
idea 72,000
$240,000 that's crazy yeah does he have
a paid version or just ads it's just ads
there's no paid
versioned like
$80,000 that's crazy like how crazy I I
just like that blew my mind that part of
the conversation where I'm like are you
freaking kidding me it's he like 85,000
people he's got 40,000 them subscribing
he he generated 230,000 and I think he's
like on par for double that this year
that's Annapolis Maryland that's not
freaking Dallas Texas I know how long is
it going to take for all of the 880,000
person cities to be saturated by a
newsletter decades I mean it doesn't
have to be your city be any City no and
like he's now trying to do this model
where he like I don't remember it's not
exactly a franchise but he's like
licensing it out to different markets
mhm again and he was a lot more
concerned about the quality I felt like

[12:02]
concerned about the quality I felt like
you could centralize a lot of this stuff
you could have local editors but a
streamline process of AI that generates
the stories and then the local editors
spend time curating it yeah just because
AI is involved doesn't mean that the
quality has to go down it just means the
editor is spending more time on the
right things as opposed to the first
draft so yeah you upload the 10 most
relevant news articles to AI you say
summarize this in bullet points then
that's just your starting point then you
put your spin on it and make it quirky
or what like what I was thinking is with
these agents now you just have them
crawl Twitter Google I don't know if
Instagram or YouTube but I know Twitter
and Google and it's like all right here
are the keyword you're looking for
Anapolis these streets popular figures
and then every day you aggregate all the
new stories that came in and the editor
is just looking and seeing like okay
what was interesting what was not
interesting so there's that aspect but
then he also has the programmatic aspect
to it were in his newsletter he's like

[13:01]
to it were in his newsletter he's like
here are the concerts that are happening
this summer here are the events the
sporting events that are going on this
month here's what the weather looks like
he's like I know it sounds weird but
everybody wants the freaking weather in
this newsletter even though they have it
on their phones like people want the
weather there's a lot of things that
could just be programmatic just easil
very easily built out but then there is
like the editorial piece that I think
would take some time so anyways I
freaking love that idea here's another
idea so it is illegal to scrape a bunch
of of emails and add them to a mailing
list right it's against the can spam Act
of 2004 all right if you are watching
this clip right now you are watching
this on YouTube and if you are a fan of
podcast please check out my podcast
while you're at it because sometimes I
have podcasts that aren't on YouTube and
sometimes I have YouTubes that aren't on
podcast so check out the ker office on
any podcast platform or you can go to
TKO pod.com also my newsletter will
throw that in there there are no ads
It's weekly it's different content that
my podcast and YouTube newsletter.
chrisj cerner.com You'll see the link
and we'll see you there you could go
find a high value audience like real

[14:02]
find a high value audience like real
estate agents and you could use cold
emailing software like lemlist mixmax
gmass whatever scrape their emails and
send cold emails to them you're not
opting them into a newsletter or a list
you're sending cold emails to them that
says hey first name I know you're a
realtor here in city name I I have this
newsletter we just talked about the real
estate market here in city name would
you mind if I send it every week and
you're just sending manual cold emails
with like three automated follow-ups
asking them if you can subscribe them
and it sounds tedious but it's all
automated and then anytime they say yes
you connect that to zapier and you opt
them in to your beehive to your
newsletter are you subscribing a like a
newsletter growth hack is that what
you're is that what you're describing
right now yeah
yeah why would you not do
that you could I think it's
genius there's 2 million realtors in the
United States you get 1% of them to opt
in if you just had 1% of this Market
Market bro bro bro it's a $250 billion

[15:04]
Market bro bro bro it's a $250 billion
Market dude if I just get 1% of 1%
that's all you need that's $25 million
dude it's crazy did you not hear me I
don't need a pitch deck my pitch deck is
1% of 250 billion or is that not enough
for you oh do you not know how to do
math pull out your iPhone and type these
numbers
in dude that that would be
really yeah that would be interesting to
like I want to start a massive
newsletter everyone's like everyone's
always like there's riches and niches
start with a niche and then grow out no
what if you were just like no I want to
do a newsletter to all the real realtors
in the nation and you build it around a
growth strategy as opposed to like going
Niche I think that'd be a really cool
idea big is the new small think about
that really yep I usually tell my wife

[16:00]
that really yep I usually tell my wife
the opposite okay what do you got for
me all right you did an episode a little
while ago and then you ended up actually
putting a tweet out about it but it's
something I've thought a lot about and I
think is really interesting I think that
there's a trend right now with people
our age and older especially people our
age and younger to spend money on Health
and Beauty in particular I'm not talking
about necessarily the gym I'm talking
about Spas for men you know trt
testosterone replacement therapy other
hormonal therapy treatments Botox laser
treatments just like lots of health
related Innovations I guess that are
coming down the market that are a
supposed to keep you young and B help
you look young so one of the things you
post about was Botox and I wanted to run
through because I thought it was
interesting how you were talking about
SEO how you go out and get customers I

[17:00]
SEO how you go out and get customers I
thought it would be fun to run through
and like actually describe the economics
of Botox was that let's do it all right
so I'm going to use me as an example but
let's say that I wanted to go and get
BOTOX do you even know how you would ask
for Botox are you like I'd like two
Botox please like do you understand how
it works no I don't no I don't do
needles when you have a natural beauty
it doesn't even register for you you
know what I'm saying totally I totally
get it dude that's why it registers so
well to me
so you buy Botox in units is what
they're called and so like for somebody
like me who has a massive
forehead it's a sign of a big
brain as my father if if it's a thousand
units do they call that a gunit or they
actually do they actually do oh
interesting huh yeah yeah yeah so so
I've got a big head I use a lot of units
as my dad would say to my mom what you
have the Jewish brain Jews are smarter
they have bigger brains
because my mom's Jewish and my dad's

[18:02]
because my mom's Jewish and my dad's
[Laughter]
racist and anyways so like for me your
first time forehead I'm probably going
to do 40
units right but then they got you know
these little things here or these things
here or they got you know some lip
filler and other places like there's
probably like 12 units here some of this
is from research some of this is because
I I was asking my neighbor who's an NP
and N owns a wellness practice like how
many units right so so that's just like
to give a general idea and then once you
get BOTOX you don't just get it once
there would be no recurring Revenue
right so of
course well part yes but what Botox does
is it it deadens not deadens the nerves
but uh
immobilizes the nerves in your face and
it but it wears off after a period of
time and so you have to get maintenance
doses you have to get you know every

[19:01]
doses you have to get you know every
three four months is kind of what it's
recommended to be and so when you go
back to get those doses it's not
necessarily I'm not getting 40 on my
forehead every time I'm getting maybe 20
right when you get two doses do you ask
for a dose dose I hadn't thought of that
I I do know that when you get doses
under 10 it's called a micro do but yeah
yeah but I'll have to ask about the dose
dose for we're so dumb I hate
all right next question 40 units let's
just say is on average what somebody
what a recurring customer gets 40 how
much is it a unit retail cost for 10
bucks yeah somewhere in that ballpark
it's like10 to $15 per unit do you know
what the wholesale cost is like what the
practice is buying those
for five
bucks yeah three and a half to $7 so
let's just like easy math we'll just say
they have
50% gross margins

[20:00]
50% gross margins
if I'm a customer and I'm
coming three times a year that average
is out to be let's just say $1,000 a
year in recurring revenue from a person
does that make sense M let's also say
that they have really high churn let's
say like 20% of the people who get it
the first time are like ah I don't like
this but then the other 80% keep you
know a maintenance for long period of
time so the lifetime value of a customer
let's just say is 5 years but last five
years is 3600 excuse me the customer
lifetime value is $3,600 but if you back
out the gross margin then it's about
,800 no sorry
$4,000 I'm not doing my math right here
hold
on five years $1,000 a year
$5,000 okay back out the gross margin
$2,500 is kind of your LTV so MH One
customer represents an
LTV of $2500

[21:00]
in my mind I'm like I wouldn't even need
to open a practice I have a neighbor
who's like right behind me and he's an
NP why wouldn't I just Target local
Facebook groups local HOA groups
local you know PTA groups and go hard
and find a neighborhood where there's
also a nurse practitioner that can go
and administer in people's homes like
concierge and just crush it that way but
I don't have the other side of the
equation I know that my customer
lifetime value or my lifetime value is
about
$2,500 how much do you think it would
cost to acquire customer this is the
part where I don't know that's and like
I know you've you like explored this on
your podcast you're looking at like $4 a
click through paid Google ads but the
the qu the question mark is what's your
conversion rate once they click $4 a
click is pretty high but at a $2,500 LTV
let's say there's 5% conversion then you
would multiply four by it so it's a
$100 is 5% conversion a good perversion

[22:02]
$100 is 5% conversion a good perversion
or good conversion or bad that'd be
pretty good it's not like amazing but
it's pretty good let's go with a bad
conversion 2% so so $200 customer
acquisition cost through if you're only
using Google ads also highly dependent
on the local market but yeah less than
10% like why would you not do that all
day and so you were just partner with
someone that's licensed to do this and
you're the Le gen source and they're the
absolutely
so there'd be two things you'd have to
figure out the first thing you'd have to
figure out is how do I
identify practitioners in that
neighborhood because I would prefer to
have some somebody who's looking at this
as a side
hustle right like I'm not trying to
start a practice that's just concierge
like I look at my neighbor comes home at
5 and you know if from like 5 to seven
three nights a week he's getting people
in and he's making an extra
$10,000 well more than that $30,000 a

[23:00]
$10,000 well more than that $30,000 a
year I'm sure he'd be open to that right
so you'd first have to like identify
kind of a neighborhood or an area and
then you'd have to identify who in that
area is a practitioner that I can go and
approach and ask if they want some extra
work I think the identifying the area is
easy because you're just going to look
at demographics you're like obviously
these are going to be higher income
you're going to look at age all of those
things so that part might be easy the
harder part is going to be how do you
find people in those target areas that
live in those areas that would be
interested in this as a side hustle I
got you here's what you need you're
missing a third party here you we need a
third person in this partnership okay a
threeway got it we've got we've
got we need a you're the L Pearlman here
okay you're the Lop Perman to the backst
street boys okay okay but you've you
you've only assembled part of the Back
Street Boys you're only assembling the
NP to actually perform the procedure

[24:01]
NP to actually perform the procedure
I've only got Nick Carter I don't have
AJ that's it I don't have ran I don't
have forget it JT
come all right keep going hold on the
funniest boy band fact in the world is
that Joey faton is the only fat one in
NSync and his last name is literally fat
one can we talk about this his last name
is fat one and he's the only fat one
honestly he didn't stand a chance it was
meant to Universe knew what they were
doing that's right anyway no you need a
mom you need a mom you need a
well-connected mom or or at least a mom
that's willing to post in a Facebook
group because here's the post here's the
post hey girls hey I'm hosting a Botox
party we can get a discount like this is
honestly I hate to say this edit this
out but don't but this is like the
perfect MLM pyramid scheme opportunity
yes yes

[25:00]
Botox like Tupperware party yeah yes
this has to exist already right you need
to find the women that did sell lulao or
new skin or tahisha Noni juice or you
name it and then they don't anymore
because the lifespan on these things is
like five years but they have all the
skills and the network although they
probably they've probably burned the
network by this point but they just need
to host parties that's right at a
discount but how do you find them I I
agree with that but how would you find
them at scale oh there's third party
tools where you can search people on
Facebook based on keywords so you could
search people that have ever posted
about Lula R and if someone's posted
about it it means they were probably a
distributor do you want to test this
with
me yes like I could go for the purposes
of this podcast yes I could go to my
neighbor and just be like hey let us try
this we'll pay for the ads we just want
to see if you get
yeah we could spend 300 bucks and just

[26:00]
yeah we could spend 300 bucks and just
see if he gets one customer from it or
one person and people listening could
replicate this wherever they are that'd
be rad all right I love that what are we
calling this is is this a segment is
this like a thing now apparently we did
the perfume segment now this is going to
be like a return and Report yeah we'll
call it the return and Report segment
and for that small group who knows what
I'm talking about you're going to be
giggling to yourself and for everybody
else you're going to be like what
returning part I don't understand sta
speaking for the 3.2% of people that
understands what that means or if you're
in Europe the 32% of
people so good it's a reference to our
religion by the way yeah I like that
idea that's a good idea it's a
relationship idea literally no money
it's one of those ideas that you launch
by making a couple dozen phone calls and
finding a couple yeses and I really do
think it's a side hustle like to me I
don't see this as like oh this is going
to
be it could scale I'm just saying like
for an NP or a PA or a nurse who can

[27:01]
for an NP or a PA or a nurse who can
administer Botox in a neighborhood and
it which won't be every state some
states are State specific on who can
administer you'd have to actually see
the guidelines and who can administer
but if you find that person for that
person they're going to have a full-time
job it's just like oh this would be cool
I could see you know two an extra 10
people a week in my neighborhood and
from those 10 people I'm going to earn
an extra $20,000 a year another thing
you could do here is once you prove out
this model you put it in a long PDF make
a course and you could sell this to NPS
there doesn't need to be there doesn't
need to be a pasty white guy like
yourself to to play middleman right it
could just be two people here and if I
did do it I'd have to be
like you know B out of my mind
like have you ever wanted to know of
cars I'm
[Music]
smiling yes you get it but I mean you
could sell a course to people to do
basically make money on the side and
then they could replace their income
entirely with this I love

[28:01]
entirely with this I love
it all right I got one for you okay do
you remember why about the domain name I
call this domain name number
732 domain name lifetimes sandals.com
lifetime sand no I haven't talked about
this in maybe six years but I still own
the domain name have you heard of shady
Rays no so sha Shady Rays I I think I'm
getting the name right is a sunglasses
company that blew up because of their
uvp unique value proposition okay they
came to the market and said we have
really nice glasses Sunglasses but guess
what everyone loses their sunglasses so
with our sunglasses lifetime warranty no
questions asked you break them you lose
them no problem we'll replace them dang
just the framing it's just the framing
and it's like well how do they make
money well they sell them you know
there's already high margin on
sunglasses and I've priced these out in
China they cost $150 to make 50 cents to

[29:00]
China they cost $150 to make 50 cents to
ship you're in at $2 you sell them for
50 bucks anytime someone files a claim
you just okay no problem you just have
to pay shipping shipping's five bucks
cost three bucks so you basically you
net even on shipping right $5 for
shipping you work your margin for the
glasses into there and so statistically
speaking they would have to file 10
claims to for you to break even on them
right and people there's friction and
they introduce strategic friction I call
it strategically introduced friction
believe it or not they introduce
friction they're like oh fill out this
form okay do this call this number and
most people are going eh not doing that
yeah yeah and like statistically even if
there is no friction 80 90% of people
will never file a claim like either they
won't lose it or if they do lose it they
won't remember they won't think to so
that idea has been done for sunglasses
but I think the same framework could be
used in any industry right lifetime
warranty and just work it into the
margin and you might take a little

[30:00]
margin and you might take a little
beating up front CU you don't know what
the claims will be so you're going to
have to leave it loose but once you
learn wow okay 2% of people are filing
claims in the first six months we could
drop our prices even more or oh gez 30%
of people are filing claims we got to
raise our prices and so that's why I
bought lifetime sandals because I rotate
through sandals like crazy I break them
all the time right so it's like if I
could pay 80 bucks for sandals and just
or if I could sell them for $80 import
them for $3 they're small they're cheap
to ship they're under uh 16 oun so they
qualify for first class you could
totally do the same thing with sandals
or something else it' probably have to
be a high like high ticket high margin
product like so my brother-in-law has
like for whatever reason gotten obsessed
with things that are manufactured in
China and he's like Ray BR Ray bands and
you know XYZ sunglasses
are manufactured by the same

[31:00]
are manufactured by the same
manufacturer oh my gosh by the same
Factory by the same people using the
same types of products but one is $300
and one is $20 so Ray brand Ray bands is
able to have this fat margin just
because of the name as opposed to like
the quality of the product and so I
would go and look at those types of
products probably they'd be manufactured
in China that are similar to other high
tick a watch right like nice watches
rings mhm sunglasses are one handbags
might be one sandals are one and just go
after that it's like okay what's what's
a high
quality High ticket product that we
could replicate and have the lifetime
warranty on and go that way doesn't
Patagonia do it like against damages or
defects I think that's what they're
known for it's similar but different
they don't ask questions maybe it's
either Patagonia or North Face I
whatever but like there's stories of

[32:01]
whatever but like there's stories of
people who have like taken their 30-year
worn boots back and and gotten them for
store credit right like so yeah yeah
there are definitely companies that do
this but this is different because it's
like if you lose it that's the key
differentiator if you lose it altoe they
will replace it whereas patagon is like
if it rips if there's a defect bring it
back right it does have to be something
specific a specific type of product and
it's kind of the honor System too right
yeah oh I lost
it I'm sure they have protections worked
in but anyway what you got you got more
what do you got for me I tweeted a
little while ago about dsos I've talked
about dsos in the past they're Dental
Services
organizations and I'll do a quick primer
on like what dsos are so Dental Services
organizations exist primarily because in
many states there regulations against
entrepreneurs owning Dental practices

[33:01]
entrepreneurs owning Dental practices
dentists can own practices but me and
you couldn't just go and start a
practice from scratch we would have to
partner with the dentist and the way
that entrepreneurs and in particular
private Equity Funds have gotten around
this is they've created these things
called Dental Services
organizations
where they don't own the practice but
they charge you know 50% management fee
to the local clinic and the local clinic
is contractually oblig to use them and
they send the money back and so it's
kind of like this workaround some of
them actually do own the clinics that
but that's because they have a a dentist
who also is a partner in the DSO but
anyways suffice it to say this is a
centralized organization that helps
support practices in the field and they
offer things like HR payroll billing
collections legal all of those sort of
administrative components that a
physician just doesn't want to deal with
you see this in the medical space with
Physicians as msos Medical Services

[34:02]
Physicians as msos Medical Services
organizations you see obviously dsos but
I like this model because you're able to
provide services at scale and you're not
necessarily getting into operating the
practices on a granular basis so that's
a quick primer on what dsos
are I think not just think we both have
a thesis that search is turning local
we like Google my business which is now
Google Business profiles are incredibly
important to driving business at the
local level AI is obviously answering a
lot of questions on Google that were
otherwise driving traffic to websites
who relied on that traffic like what's a
good recipe for tomato soup that used to
drive traffic to People's websites and
it was like a lead funnel that then took
them down the road to buy a cookbook
from that website now Google just gives
you the answer based on all the things
that they're aggregating off of the
internet well you can't do that with
local search yet and so Google business

[35:02]
local search yet and so Google business
profile is becoming increasingly more
important with reviews and and all the
things and and we've talked about
launching an agency to do actual Google
Business profiles in the past but I
think there's an interesting business
and this would be like a
wholesaler of just hooking up
parties Google my business
agencies on one end dsos on the other
and a middleman who just connects them
like almost like a lead gen
organization but specific to Medical in
particular because not to be confused
with hooking up
parties look I'm honestly I'm not going
to discriminate against any type of
parties if you want to hook up like I
get it I won't be participating my
pineapple won't be upside down but I get
it so and the way that I would do this
again back to like the local
conversation that we were having having
is I would start looking at my local

[36:00]
is I would start looking at my local
networks do I know any dentists do I
know any Physicians and start I mean you
see these people at barbecues you see
these people at your local kids events
and you you always make the small talk
oh how are the Bills doing this year oh
man the dolphins really do suck can you
believe Lane kein still coaching but
Nick sabbin ain't I tell you
what anyways and just ask them like hey
you're a dentist right yeah yeah are you
part of a DSO are you a physician are
you part of a Medical Group and the
second they say yes or no like just ask
them how are they finding leads how are
they I'm curious I'm starting to learn
more about this but there are a ton of
accounts on Twitter on Facebook wherever
that are easily
findable that will provide those
services and then you don't need to be
the one like you don't need to start a
Google business profile agency you just
are the middleman you connect them you
get a fee and perpetuity wash your hands
and you're out
and so I think it's like localizing the

[37:00]
and so I think it's like localizing the
lead gen space in your local community
not necessarily for dentists or medical
anyone that's on Google it could be I'm
just I'm using them as examples right
because I think they're two two really
really good examples but like back to
what we were talking about with my nurse
practitioner neighbor I know he's a
nurse practitioner H who could I hook
him up with to get him more leads CU I
think that local lead generation and and
specifically Focus fing on local lead
generation is going to become more and
more important and more and more
specialized and they don't yet
know who the new I guess agencies are
that are specializing in this so instead
of them like figuring out on their own
you being proactive and then taking a
piece of of the referral by leveraging
your your network here's another idea so
same approach same thesis which I agree
with you approach the guy at the party
and say Hey you start talking about his
practice I know this is random but I saw
I noticed on your Google uh business

[38:01]
I noticed on your Google uh business
profile that X Y and Z like you're not
doing updates or you're not doing this
you're not doing XY or Z strategic thing
that people should be doing to get more
leads is there a reason why oh I don't I
don't even think about that he's like
dude I don't know man like I know this
other dentist who does those things and
it drives like 60% of his business would
you mind if I like if you give me
limited access and I can just start
poking around in there and seeing if it
helps your business just very low
pressure no cost anything and then a
month or two later dude I drove 38 calls
to your office yeah I've actually
noticed it's been busy hey I've actually
started a business around this would you
mind if I would you mind paying me a
thousand bucks a month to manage this so
would you white label it or would you be
you would actually do it I just do it I
just do
it yeah I think because you're already
like halfway there if you're finding the
leads you know so it's like H depending
on what your situation is in life at
that point you might as well learn the
skills and have an agency one to two
grand a month per customer yeah that's a

[39:00]
grand a month per customer yeah that's a
good point I'm like fascinated kind of
obsessed with this idea of the local
economy not the locco economy it's not
the local economy it's the local economy
thank you for
clarifying sorry I froze again that
makes more sense all right I got a
little hack little life hack for anyone
listening
okay if you want to find out what to
sell so we all know native deodorant
origin story
he went to Etsy he saw what was
bestselling he saw that people were
buying all natural deodorant aluminum
free he started making it himself he
cracked Facebook ads he sold it for $100
million in like nine months to to
Proctor and Gamble there's another Etsy
hack out there where go to Etsy let the
algorithm lead you and I love this hack
for anything go create a brand new
Facebook account on a new computer or in
a new browser in a with a proxy whatever
or Instagram Twitter any of the social
networks see what the algorithm shows

[40:01]
networks see what the algorithm shows
you when it doesn't know who you are
okay because that's going to show you
what's interesting what's trending it's
going to show you like the most viral
things because it doesn't know what you
want to see okay that's really
interesting I've done this on Instagram
recently and like my personal account on
Instagram is all just females gym
clothes bikinis right but then when I go
that's so weird there must be a glitch
when I go to an outside account it's
like you you know the news or normal
stuff do you know why that would
be there's no way must be a glitch
there's no way of
knowing okay sorry keep going okay so go
to Etsy see what it showing you it's
going to show you some really best
sellers and that that alone is going to
be a good tell as to what's selling well
because if you create an account and you
log in you start making some searches
looking around then it's going to show
you what it thinks you want to buy not
what is the big seller right now but go

[41:00]
what is the big seller right now but go
find a popular Etsy seller based on how
many previous sales they are they have
because Etsy will show you a lot of that
data and look at their reviews and let's
say an Etsy seller sells a hundred
different items look at their most
recent reviews and what items is are
everyone talking about in the reviews
and that's going to tell you on the
biggest sellers the best sellers what
the most popular items are because there
are so many opportunities to unbundle
Etsy to take products or products
product lines pull them outside of Etsy
take them to Amazon take them to Shopify
a lot of times it's already been done
right it's not like a given that it
hasn't been done but there are Arbitrage
opportunities there where you look at
the reviews what are they talking about
in the reviews and you'll see what the
best sellers are what I talked about a
month ago on my podcast is finding out
what Shopify bestsellers are by pasting
a URL suffix into a Shopify store where
would you start with that that what do
you mean would you go or would you have

[42:00]
you mean would you go or would you have
your wife like start looking I would go
like what would be the first filter you
would search for it depends on what you
want to sell I mean let's do it right
now okay so I open Etsy and I'm going to
type in the word
Texas because I've done this before for
Texas snacks so there's no way there's
no way to sort like top sellers you can
filter by that but it's not always
accurate because it's combining with the
algorithm to show you what it thinks
that you want and so I want to find
Sellers as in the account selling items
not necessarily the actual items within
the accounts I'm looking at this store
called just phone cases okay literally
the name is just phone cases and what
are their best sellers nurse bags and
nurse coasters really right so to me
that's a big tell that someone that
literally they're called just phone
cases really that's all we sell they're
selling a ton of nursing coasters and
nursing bags I like okay maybe there's

[43:00]
nursing bags I like okay maybe there's
an idea there for an e-commerce store
solely pointed at nurses kind of like
that scrubs company I forget the name
that they they publicly traded company
figs they're publicly traded and they
just sell freaking scrubs to
nurses so jez love it all right was that
it all right that's it it was a banger
today it's a banger this one was a
banger all right man right see you later
all right okay what you think what you
think of hold Co Bros every Friday we'll
see you next time
