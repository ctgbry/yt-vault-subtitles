welcome to the ker office so if you're
just now joining us I've started about
75 businesses over the last 15 years and
there's been a Common Thread in all 75
of those businesses domain names domain
name buying is an art not a science and
this video will show you the art of
domain name buying investing holding
flipping you name it everything I know
about making money with domain names I'm
going to share in this video so stick
around I'm first going to focus on the
auction side of things how to find
undervalued Niche domain names that are
expiring or that are already expired or
that are ignored or that cost Pennies on
the dollar and then I'm going to focus
on all the different ways of making
money with domain names hopping on viral
Trends hopping on macro Trends hopping
on misspellings of your website hopping
on misspellings of your competitor's
website hopping on misspellings of other
websites I own the domain name chag
gp.com I bought it right when chat ggpt
came out guess what it gets traffic I'm
going to teach you how to do all those
things at the end of this video so let's
get right to
[Music]
it all right this is Dy do D do is my

[01:01]
it all right this is Dy do D do is my
go-to resource for buying domain names
looking at domain names on auction
learning about domain name investing and
everything so let's get right to it
we're going to click on aftermarket
expired auctions okay so here's where it
gets important we want to set the right
filters to find domain names that have
the highest potential value now keep in
mind not all domain names have the same
value to different people so the person
who owned Korean dictionary. net might
have moved on from that project but you
might be starting a different project
having to do with Korean dictionaries
that is a lot more promising so stop
asking yourself oh if this is so
valuable why is he letting it go well
because you don't know their his or her
situation for instance this domain name
right here says radio fun that could
have been a Blog about radios with very
very low upside low ceiling you might
love this domain name because you have
an idea to host radio meetups for ham
radio enthusiasts and you know that ham
radio enthusiasts on average have a much
higher net worth than the general
population and that they spend $3,000 a
year on ham radio equipment and you know
that you could monetize this site better
than anyone else okay this is a perfect

[02:02]
than anyone else okay this is a perfect
example so don't look at these through
the filter of this isn't very valuable
because someone's letting it go no no no
no what are you going to do with it I'm
going to help give you those ideas okay
before we even set filters let's talk
best practices generally speaking do is
better than any other TLD ending do was
first it's what we know we're
comfortable with it especially older
Generations are not comfortable going to
n.com websites d.n. org those serve a
purpose let me be clear but if you can
snag the.com then go for theom there are
other use cases where a bio or a me make
perfect sense if you're buying your
first and last name me is great if
you're just going to link to something
on social media it doesn't matter as
much but if people will be typing in
your website directly into the browser
which more people do than you might
think you want to make it short
memorable easy to spell rhyming is great
when possible Doom whenever possible no
dashes don't try to get cute don't make
it super long keep it simple also don't
forget about syllables a domain name

[03:00]
forget about syllables a domain name
might be really long but have fewer
syllables or it might be short with a
lot of syllables facebook.com two
syllables one less thanth facebook.com
it's cleaner you might own a fourl
domain name with two W's ww jd.com
ignore the fact that that's a common
acronym because that would make that
domain name very valuable what makes it
less valuable is the fact that it's ww
jd.com eight syllables in only four
letters so the number of letters isn't
everything the number of words isn't
everything the number of SLL isn't
everything the domain name ending isn't
everything but all of these in context
really make a difference also this might
sound obvious but make your name and or
your domain name something that says
what you do Facebook that was a thing in
college it was like a yearbook I had a
company that shipped food sende eats.com
I had a company that fixed phones phon
restore.com I have a tree care business
fasttree care.com I owned a business
that made fast shipping software Speedos
ship.com when possible don't incorporate
your first name into the business that's

[04:01]
your first name into the business that's
generally not optimized but ironically
if you're a big business it is optimized
because it makes you look smaller than
you actually are but you don't know if
you're going to get big yet so let's
mitigate the risk as much as possible
okay with all that in mind let's start
shopping for domain names I'm going to
be very careful to set some filters here
I want no more than 10 characters okay
10 characters I want to look at Dooms
only to start let's talk about domain
name age this is very very very
important because Google wants to know
that your domain name is is credible
it's relevant and it has Authority so if
it was registered yesterday it doesn't
have any of those things yet and that's
okay but if you're buying an existing
domain name older is always better so
let's go for five plus years old and
that's it I don't want to set too many
filters cuz I don't want to sell myself
short all right let's just look at some
of these domain names I didn't do any
prep beforehand and just start ideating
hp.com that's a four-letter domain name
those can be valuable but it doesn't
mean that it is valuable I've seen four
later domain name sell for $50 or $40

[05:00]
later domain name sell for $50 or $40
but if it's the right four letters if
you got some vowels in there some
commonly used consonants like s t r or
it could be the acronym for a big
company it could be a very valuable
domain name Spain news.com that could be
interesting it's both two words and two
syllables and Spain has what 50 60 100
million people in it but more
importantly this is what makes domains
like these valuable backlinks look at
this
262,000 backlinks and 5 years old here's
why that's important there's two types
of backlinks inbound links and backlinks
an inbound link specifically refers to
the direction of the traffic of a link
to a site inbound vers outbound if I
have links on my website leading to
someone else's that's an outbound link
but back links are a little bit
different than inbound links backlinks
refer to one website linking to another
in the context of SEO search engine
optimization so here on D do you'll see
some of the auction Pages list off links
sometimes it says back links sometimes
it it calls them inbound links and this
is a very important distinction that I

[06:01]
is a very important distinction that I
haven't seen other websites do this is
one of the main reasons I use din do
here in this context links is referring
to back links which is the best type of
links a backlink is basically a
five-star review a backlink means some
other website out there is giving their
blessing to your website saying this is
not a scam this is legit when you click
on dogs for sale you're going to see
dogs for sale you're not going to see
something else you're going to get what
you expect and not a bait and switch but
not all backlinks are created equal if I
go by Chris's stupid blog
and start linking to other websites my
website has no domain Authority which
means that my backlinks are worth almost
nothing so more back links are better
than less but you want as many of them
to be from websites that have a strong
domain Authority and that's scored from
1 to 100 and you can use other websites
to check what the domain Authority is of
a website but right off the bat it makes
sense to me that Spain newws docomond of
thousands of backlinks because it used
to be a news site and it's going up for
auction this could be an amazing
opportunity you could use AI to
summarize Spanish news articles and auto

[07:00]
summarize Spanish news articles and auto
publish them one a day five a day 100 a
day you could have thousands of landing
pages one for each of the cities in
Spain see that's why I love domain name
buying flipping investing holding being
a degenerate because there are so many
opportunities it's like I go to din do
to shop like my wife goes to Target to
shop it's just a world of opportunity in
there okay radio fun.com eight letters
three syllables two words 23 links not a
lot 23 years old a lot the oldest
website on here is about 28 years old
now I don't know how you're going to
monetize radios but I do know that you
can monetize anything and that no Niche
is too small so use your imagination GIF
geek.com oh man that could be an
affiliate site with tech gadgets where
you make 10 to 40% off everything you
sell online math.com are you kidding me
this could be a course website for kids
current bid is $8.99 78 backlinks 27
years old let's say I want to start a
software as a service company or a tech
company I don't mind using a name like
Zillow or Google because it's hard to
describe what technology actually does
so I'm going to scroll down here and
look at oh will o.com that could be good

[08:01]
look at oh will o.com that could be good
now it's short but it's three syllables
but it's fairly easy to spell 19 years
old 88 backlinks now the dine appraisal
is pretty accurate but it doesn't mean
that's what it's going to sell for so
don't let the D appraisal discourage you
from bidding or buying something because
I have seen domain sell in these
auctions for 99% less than what the D
appraisal was so basically just shut
this off from your mind and bid on what
you think you could monetize the best
all right let's go up here and look at
some other offerings in their
aftermarket section first of all they
have an invest guide that's incredible
thousands and thousands of words I've
read most of these so it's a good place
to start but let's go to the expired
closeout section one of my favorites
this is not an auction these are
websites that nobody wanted and they
sell for as little as $5 you could go to
any other website any other competitor
to D do and you'd have to pay $10 to $20
for these just because no one wanted
these doesn't mean you don't it means it
didn't fit their project it wasn't worth
them paying for every year so let's do
some more filtering and see if there's
anything interesting here we'll do 5
years old minimum no more than 10 cars
characters in fact let's limit it to six

[09:01]
characters in fact let's limit it to six
characters and not limit it to Dooms
because there is value in the n.com URLs
5-year-old minimum six character count
maximum nld not just.com all right now
we're going to go to a different tab of
D do and we're going to go to the
expired closeout section I love this
section because I'm a cheapo and these
are domain names that no one registered
no one bid on no one wanted but they
still might have value to you and your
project so most of these domain names
cost $5 and if I were to go to any other
competing website to dyo do they would
cost $ 122 to $20 so you can set up the
same filters here you can look by tlds
by the age by the character count and
you won't have to compete with anyone
because these are by now and not an
auction all right so now I'm going to
show you some domain names I own and I'm
going to peel back the curtain into my
brain you might need to close your eyes
a little bit but I'm going to tell you
what I was thinking when I bought these
what my strategy is with them and how
you can shamelessly reverse engineer
copy my strategies to make some money
for yourself but before I get there I
did want to give one more plug to dinod
do they'll manage your email you can
build your website with a drag and drop
editor you can buy domains buy from

[10:00]
editor you can buy domains buy from
auction sell your domains learn about
domain name investing most of the other
websites out there only do one or two of
these things but din do has it all in
one place so good job dad do also before
I forget you can also use it for domain
appraisal if you have a domain name
anywhere you can find out what it's
worth and there suggestion tool is
really cool let's say I want to start a
piano moving company right piano moving
oh looks like the dot is not available
but it suggests other ways you could
change the domain to find one that is
available super cool all right now to
the last class section all right I own
about 130 domain names right now and I
took a small fraction of them I pasted
them over here and I categorized some of
the domain names that I found
interesting so I can tell you what I'm
thinking here's four domain names I own
and I put these in the oopsies redirect
category animala care.com was $3,000 and
we generate leads for pet cremation
businesses but I didn't know if this
business would work so I started by
buying animal- Aftercare docomo my own
rule by buying a domain name with a dash
in it because I was just trying to
validate an idea so premium domain names
are super worth watching if you go to
open an ice cream shop you're going to

[11:01]
open an ice cream shop you're going to
want to open in the best corner in town
that's obvious but why wouldn't you want
a better domain name for your online
business especially when 15% of web
traffic comes from people just typing in
things directly into the Google browser
not Google search but into your Chrome
browser my friend Peter owns Vidalia
onions.com and a ton of his traffic
income comes from people typing that in
directly not even knowing that he
existed beforehand that's his whole
strategy and I have an interview with
him animal Dasa care.com was $12 we
proved out it worked then I reached out
to the owner of animala care.com through
din do and negotiated it down to $3,000
now we have a thriving business there
Texas snacks.com the cks was not
available right off the bat I couldn't
even find the owner so we bought the X
we proved the domain name a year or two
later I found the owner and I paid
$1,500 because if someone is talking to
someone at church or out and about and
they say oh you got to check out Texas
snacks.com they're not going to tell
them with an X they're going to type in
this one directly and this automatically
directs to the X now viral Trends so I
was on Twitter once and Andrew taint was

[12:01]
was on Twitter once and Andrew taint was
trending millions of views millions of
Impressions so me being an opportunist
and kind of a degenerate went to dyo do
typed in Andrew tank.com and it was open
10 bucks so I bought it have I done
anything with it no will I let it expire
maybe I just want to own it it's an
asymmetric bet also I saw a post go
viral tens of millions of views it was a
picture of a toilet in the shape of a
skeleton head and the caption was babe
what's wrong you haven't even used your
skelet toilet today but these can
actually be bought there's a company
that sells skeleton shaped toilets
and they didn't own skele toilet or
skelet toilet.com so I bought them what
am I going to do with it nothing but
what I could do with it is just put up a
bunch of content about toilets or unique
toilets or Halloween themed toilets or
seasonal themed toilets and I could link
to all the manufacturers and make an
affiliate fee for every one of them this
could be a business today and it's just
sitting in my dinot account doomsday
inab box.com an influencer posted man I
I really want to buy survival gear and
food storage but it's such a mess to
find it all from one place I wish I
could just click a button and buy it
hm so I went to D dot and bought Dooms

[13:02]
hm so I went to D dot and bought Dooms
danab box.com never did anything with it
okay these are my why not domains one
word domain names are very valuable even
if they're not a do com so one day I was
just searching and I found these two
stupid onew domain names.co and I bought
them and I never did anything because I
think they're worth more than what I
paid for them and I'm going to sit on
them for a while I used to own the
domain named
dor.com for some other project I can't
even remember never did anything with it
someone came knocking on my door offered
me $100 for it and I thought hm how
about 1,500 we went back and forth and I
sold it for 750 bucks and that paid for
my whole domain name addiction for that
month buy domain names to protect
yourself and your name your initial me.
co.com buy as many as you can fun fact I
got scammed by a guy and he did not own
his own domain name so I built a website
on his name's domain name with the
entire dossier of everything I found out
about him as a scammer and I promise you
this is I'm not lying years later when
he finally got caught the FBI reached
out to me and they told me they were
referred to my website for some of their

[14:00]
referred to my website for some of their
evidence that is not a joke just in case
I tweeted once about what I coined the
10 alaga triangle Tennessee Alabama
Georgia from Atlanta to Chattanooga to
Birmingham I said was going to be a real
estate hot bed and the Tweet went viral
so I thought huh I wonder if the phrase
tenaga this is really dumb I know I'm
embarrassed okay it sounds really stupid
when I say it but the Texas triangle is
a thing right so I was trying to make it
a thing over in the Southeast and so I
thought hey it's kind of like a $10
copyright that you can buy in 30 seconds
so I just bought it common misspellings
chag gp.com one of the competitors for
one of my businesses was called minor
Depot Depot spelled with a t and I
thought a lot of people are going to
misspell that I heard a podcast about a
guy with a mattress business that bought
up hundreds of misspellings of his
competitors and it drove millions of
dollars to his business Nobody Does this
nobody is doing this you need to be
doing it these are kind of dumb goats
say pets Chase shiny objects.com pickup
pianos liquid adderal don't ask these
are all projects that I have planned in
the future if you want to open a gym in

[15:00]
the future if you want to open a gym in
Rexburg Idaho you're gonna have to go
through me first because flexbury best
name for that gym and then macro trends
when chat GPT came out everyone was
talking about Lang chain and llms and I
thought huh that's going to be
ubiquitous like JavaScript or C++ so I
bought these two domain names meme
genres plastic and blood we're all
worried about microplastics never touch
plastic scalp care.org scalp care is a
trending topic on Google Trends seed
oils everyone's worried about seed oils
organ meat organ meat is going up in
popularity so look for these Trends you
can use Google Trends for it and buy
domain names around them I hope you
learned something here hit me with a
like and a share and or a comment and
most importantly check out Dino dot for
all your domain name needs they support
me so I support them you will not be
disappointed
