look at this freaking thing right here
find something local Artisan in demand
farmers markets and bring it to the
world you can either do that by copying
these items yourself or by providing a
venue or a platform for the artist to
sell them as well kind of like Etsy but
for farmers markets this woman makes
these amazing gourds aren't they
gorgeous she turns them into nightlights
ornaments all kinds of cool things but
look at this comment right here she only
sells at her local farmers market in
Upstate New York and her videos get tens
of millions of views that equals
opportunity so reach out to her offer to
help her scale or use her as inspir
ation to do something similar yourself
there's no shortage of opportunity out
there full business plan right here
