[00:00]
all right welcome to the ker office I
want to do a little different episode
today I have had many of you submit your
business ideas to me over the last month
or two I've got about 30 of them I'm
going to cover some of them and I want
to roast them and when I say roast I
mean that pretty liberally because I'm
not really a mean guy um and I like most
business ideas because I think almost
any idea could work I think the bigger
question is should you launch something
not would it work or not um so roast
might not be the most accurate word but
rather grade them I grade them and I'm
going to vote them a stud or a dud uh
your idea uh now I'm working with very
limited info here because I I have like
between three words and three sentences
from all of these and so a lot of times
you get the best feedback and info from
ideas when you just ask them 20
questions and I don't have that luxury
right now so I'm also going to be live
streaming this to YouTube and maybe
someone will hop in and ask a question
maybe it'll give you an idea to launch
something of your own maybe you can copy
one of these shamelessly uh and there's

[01:01]
one of these shamelessly uh and there's
nothing wrong with that so let's just
get into
it I have two types of ideas I have
college student submitted ideas and then
I have any type of person submitted
ideas so I will clarify before the idea
so you know what type of person it's
from all right first idea is from a
college student named Anthony he says I
want to start a nonprofit called Project
Earth where we would develop robots that
clean our planet probably we'll never
get to see it happen because of the
unbelievable amount of funding it will
take though Anthony I love your idea um
I love your optimism and your
willingness to start a nonprofit um but
I suggest that you start with something
easier even if it is a nonprofit um
start with a nonprofit that encourages
college students to clean up around
campus right start there get some
traction um and then Branch out maybe to
other campuses maybe to non- col
students and start to make a name for
yourself online on on social media

[02:00]
yourself online on on social media
that this is your thing that you're
trying to clean up our planet um and
then at that point it will be
significantly easier to raise funding if
you want to use robots to do it and hey
maybe you can get a partnership with
figure or with Tesla or with any of the
three or four companies that are trying
to build these robots right now um maybe
they can give you a couple for free
because it's a nonprofit so love the
idea but I don't think you should start
with robots I think you should start
very simply and go from there okay next
idea from another another college
student I want to start a marketing
agency for cash payon psychiatrists okay
I love how niched this is already so I'm
already liking this idea I have a direct
in to a network of psychiatrists who
share a paino of not being able to book
appointments for a certain audience
competitive Advantage is being able to
work directly with a top psychiatrist in
my area which allows me to get clients
and spinoff more services off the back
of my client base

[03:00]
of my client base
okay so you've got an in which I love
it's very Niche which I love and it
seems that there is a demand for this
which I love so I don't see a problem
with this you don't have an in with one
psychiatrist you have an in with an an
in with a network of psychiatrists that
seems to say that this is a common
problem so yes I love this idea this is
a stud and I think you should do it so
we've got a guy in the lobby let's let
him in hey what's going on let's hear
your idea thank you about potato chips
okay chips I'm not talking about AI
chips for now yeah gotcha okay yeah so
they are freshly made and given to you
and they are
flavored with whatever flavor you would
like so in United States we we buy a lot
of chips I mean we all buy a lot of
chips right but those are made long back
like outdated I mean at least uh a week
two or a month ago or couple of months

[04:01]
two or a month ago or couple of months
ago right and we buy to a we we go to a
store and buy it from them either it's
HB whole fors whatever in Texas I'm in
Texas
too right so I was thinking of a me and
my wife was thinking of an idea where
why don't we set up small shops where we
where we make chips from scratch right
so you you as a consumer customer come
into the store hey I want this potato
chips with buffalo ranch right whatever
flavor so we make it in 5 10 minutes and
give it to you so you enjoy hard served
chips right and you go from there so let
me just make sure I have this straight
so you basically have the potatoes maybe
sliced prepped maybe sitting in water
ready to fry someone walks up and says
hey I want the ranch chips you say all
right give me five minutes and it's it's
kind of a fast casual concept solely
focus on potato chips um that's it right

[05:02]
focus on potato chips um that's it right
yeah potato chips and it could be any
other but we could start with potato
chips right and uh maintain high quality
in terms of ingredients having so lot of
people go to F guys because they use uh
they use peanut oil along with the
peanut oil along with the french fries
to give them a better quality right so I
just want to copy whatever is working
wherever you go when you buy chips it
has a lot of ingredients which are not
needed in chips right would would this
be more of a place where you eat the
chips on site or you bag them up and
they take them with them bag them up and
take them okay have you looked into like
the popcorn shops that do this I know
there's one in mckin called Mom and
popcorn have you have you looked into
them at all I would look into that
because it's basically what they do
except they don't they won't make it on
the spot for you they just sell all

[06:00]
the spot for you they just sell all
kinds of different unique popcorn
flavors like buffalo ranch and pizza and
it's actually really good pickle
flavored but it's also a candy store so
the popcorn is just one element of it
and I don't know what the percentage of
sales the popcorn represents but it's
it's primarily a a sweet store in Like a
downtown walkable area that also sells
popcorn that reminds me of this what
what I like about the idea is that it's
high margin no one's really fing this
need what I don't like about it is that
it's it's new and it's scary to me to
invest a new food concept so I think you
should try it you should test this idea
it would cost very very little at a
farmer market just get a fryer and pay a
hundred bucks and just see what people
think what is their feedback is it that
much more remarkable to have a fresh
chip from the fryer um that hasn't
doesn't have preservatives and all that
or is just like yeah this is a really
good chip but I wouldn't come back
because at the end of the day you're
going to need people to come back and to
like get addicted to a very specific
flavor that you offer cuz if you're just
having to sell to new customers all the

[07:01]
having to sell to new customers all the
time with A New Concept it doesn't work
right like crumble was kind of a New
Concept and it worked because people
were coming back you know and margins
were really high and I feel like the
margins would be really high for what
you're doing too it just makes me
nervous that it's it's a new food
concept um I just don't like being first
go the way to try it out is Farmers
Market that's what I thought as well uh
I mean get you get the old use fryer and
try it in farmers market and see the
feedback and what people say yeah yeah I
think so it another thing that makes me
nervous is do people like do are they
really passionate about chips because it
feels to me like in the chips versus
french fry argument french fries win and
you should also look into there's a
concept out of Utah that does like
french fry only french fries only like
loaded fries fry nachos and they might
do soda like dirty sodas as well mhm um

[08:00]
do soda like dirty sodas as well mhm um
I would look into that and kind of see
what their business model is you might
be able to copy some aspects of what
they're doing but that that also makes
nous um let's see I think it's called
Fizz in fries f r YZ there's one
location in Logan where I actually grew
up YZ I don't know if they
have right here's their
website looks like they're
franchising so yeah I would be wary of
copying these guys because it looks like
they've only had one location for years
because they have been in Logan for
years and they have a franchise tab up
but it looks like it's just like
collecting interest for people that
might want to franchise I don't think
they're actually doing it but I think
just because of the fact that you have
this idea and you like this idea you've
got to get it out of your head by
testing it you got to cross that bridge
to see if it's viable or not or else
you're always just going to wonder yeah
I know okay so

[09:00]
I know okay so
this is a technology idea where uh uh
you I've been following you for a long
time uh from Twitter uh newsletter and
here right you you work a lot on hedback
construction uh I mean uh those kind of
sector too right so I I I was seeing a
lot of people when it comes to Plumbing
or hedback so the prices are not fixed
MH uh people can I mean every company
has a different pricing structure and
people can can give you any sort of
price so I thought of building so I I
I'm a software man software engineering
manager right and I have built products
end to end so I thought of building uh
uh biding platform where uh as a
customer I put in my problem statement
when I say problem statement or my need
my requirement right and they could just
they could just type in few things and
AI would uh auto correct everything with

[10:01]
AI would uh auto correct everything with
a picture if needed and uh it it's a
Marketplace a two-sided marketplace
where consumer uh puts in their need
requirement and we have bunch of HVAC
companies sitting on the other side
right which would take in the request
and whoevers there could be multiple
people submitting the code and uh
multiple people submitting the code and
our platform will make it easy for the
user uh showing the cheapest bid and
going through their website scraping all
the reviews and uh reviews and the
information that they have and uh
providing uh necessary information for a
customer to make an informed decision
are these the right people to do it
based on information that we see uh uh
based on information that we see online
right and uh based on their bid right
and based on their uh presence outside
so are you familiar with Thumbtack yeah

[11:02]
so are you familiar with Thumbtack yeah
but they don't do real time right what
do you mean real time so the these are
all real time you you submit in your
requirement and based on uh based on
what uh the other person I mean the
hitag company what the H company feels
about they submit you a quote real time
well thumb Tech is is is pretty real
time because the contractors are so
eager to get the work because they pay
thumb Tac so much to be on there that I
use thumb Tech as a consumer on a
regular basis and I'll have quotes
within a half hour so it's pretty real
time I think this this idea is pretty
audacious Tech had to raise nine figures
to do this and they're doing it really
well I like the idea I think it's good
but I think it's it it'd be really hard
to test like on a small scale and then
once you do once your test results look
good you have to compete against thumb
teac and I don't like that about it what
I do like is and this is where I thought
you were going with this is building a

[12:01]
you were going with this is building a
piece of software that you sell to HVAC
companies that enables them to kind of
like offer a a menu of services to
customers and so like let's say I type
in Plano Texas HVAC and I get 10 results
and on nine of them I click and it's
like call us for a quote call us for a
quote call us for a quote and on the
other one that I I click it's just like
hey answer two questions and we'll give
you a quote right now so I like the idea
of selling you know $200 a month
software to HVAC companies that enable
them to easily give quotes to customers
with like a a big asterisk of hey when
we get there if we find out that it's
not really as advertised this quote is
subject to change but assuming that
everything is accurate um yeah it's
going to be 250 bucks to replace
whatever you think needs replacing I
like that idea um because I don't think
anyone's doing that um and it gives HVAC
companies a leg up on their competitors

[13:01]
companies a leg up on their competitors
or or any pick pick any home service
right it gives them a leg
up but how would it be different than
Thum Tech as you said because thumb this
isn't a Marketplace you're just selling
a an app a widget that Home Service
businesses can build into their existing
platform they don't have to build their
company around it um it could just be
like a a suffix on their URL right like
it's a new a quote form basically where
instead of like submitting your name and
number and address and then having
someone call you you submit your name
and your number and what's going on and
then it gives you a price right away
because some customers are like I don't
want to talk to you I don't want to wait
for your guy to show up two hours late I
just I just want a price and if someone
can give me a price I'm probably not
going to shop around and find something
$50 cheaper I'm probably just going to
go with you yeah nobody has time
nowadays exactly I I I don't want to
have five people come to my house to
give a price I'd rather pay a little
more to just get a price and have
someone come do it so I do like that

[14:00]
someone come do it so I do like that
idea starting with one industry just
going all in on that industry and then
branching out to other Industries all
right thank you for coming in he came
from the YouTube live link which is
awesome there's a few more people
watching on YouTube meanwhile I'm going
to read some more presubmit questions so
this next one is from Luke Luke says I
do web development I Target small to
medium businesses looking for a
professional easy to manage website I
also can do some JavaScript features
that's all they told me I assume that
your idea is build websites for small to
mediumsized businesses I think it's a
great business I think it was a good
business in 1998 I think it's going to
be a great business in 2038 it's kind of
funny how no matter how many companies
come out Squarespace X
Weebly card uh WordPress web flow it
doesn't matter there will always be a
market for an individual or a business
owner to say hey just make this website
for me always right it doesn't matter

[15:00]
for me always right it doesn't matter
how many tools there are there's a dozen
different AI tools that can build a
website from a prompt people are still
going to want people to do it for them
so if that's your idea Luke um I think
it's a good idea so that's three college
student ideas let's hop over to um the
non- col student ideas this is from Ki
he says been mulling over starting a
hydrol Biz essential oils think rosemary
oil eucalyptus Etc I found a vendor in
China that makes distilling units for
half the price as USA made only problem
is I don't have land to grow said plants
but can Outsource that from around the
city and I don't know if there is really
a market to compete against the big
players in the game that Source globally
with cheap labor a I don't really like
this idea um I'll tell you why you're
already thinking along the lines of I
want to get something from China okay if
you've already flipped that switch in
your brain you're like halfway there so
now the question you need to ask

[16:00]
now the question you need to ask
yourself is what is the most
advantageous thing I can import from
China to sell in the US and in my
opinion and I've done this a lot the
higher ticket the better period end of
story find an item that is small and
expensive okay for instance we sell
Bitcoin miners we import them from China
they're not really small there's about
as big as like a desktop Tower and they
weigh 33 lbs but even so we don't need
to ship them in a container
right I say small because I want you to
ship them via DHL air that makes all the
difference in the world you can have it
from Hong Kong or shenzen or guano to
your door within three
days and the higher the ticket the
better because it means you can H use
paid ads to sell it you don't have to
sell as many of course there's always a
trade-off higher tet ticket equals lower
volume but I like that tradeoff I would
much rather sell $1,000 item to 10
people than a $100 item to 100 people um
any day of the week so I don't like the

[17:01]
any day of the week so I don't like the
essential oils idea in a sense it is
high ticket based on the size but you're
already looking at China I don't like
the idea that you have to grow something
you need land um I don't know anything
about that market I will admit um I know
that is kind of slimy there is some
there are some bad actors in this space
which I don't like that idea about it as
well um I assume that something
triggered you to give you this idea I
just I don't like the idea of being
essential oils um or something that you
would have to grow and I don't
understand why you would have to grow
something if you were going to import
this from China if you really want to do
it then import it from China to kind of
test the model and see because maybe you
find that there's a ton of pent up
demand for a very specific type of oil
that's just going gang busters if so
great import it from China to prove the
model um and then go down the road of
actually growing it and processing it
yourself to boost your margins if the
numbers make sense let's let's go to our
next pre-submitted questions right now

[18:02]
next pre-submitted questions right now
if you're just joining us we are
roasting business ideas and I use that
term loosely I'm grading them is it a
stud or a dud joh asks if he should sell
20 to $50 PDFs of nicely formatted
market research for local service
businesses so I need a little more
context what type of market research is
it a restaurant is it a home service
business um is it competitive research
or is it consumer research the fact that
it's $ 20 to $50 I don't like it's
really really hard to sell something at
that price point and it's hard to sell
things to local service businesses they
are hard to sell to notoriously most of
them don't have employees that means
when they get a call they're expecting
SL hoping it to be a customer and if
it's a salesperson they tune out
immediately and they get calls from a
lot of salespeople ask me how I know all
else equal I'm only going on about 12
words here I don't like that idea I
think it needs to be 300 $50 instead of
20 to 50 and it's going to be I think

[19:02]
20 to 50 and it's going to be I think
it's going to be hard to find customers
I think you need to go upm market to
more medium siiz businesses and sell a
multi thousand market research product
to them um something that could make
them more money somehow uh next question
Chad Kroger all right lease he wants to
lease a tiny 100 square foot commercial
space with Street Frontage in a dense
City like New York customers pay $10 to
spin a wheel think Wheel of Fortune
there's two possible outcomes a shot of
whiskey and pickle juice or a
collectible Chad Kroger stickle welcome
to pickleback or Nickelback all right um
Chad okay I hate the idea of renting a a
commercial space in New York for this
because man you've got to sell a lot of
$10 tickets to pay the rent on that but
I do like the idea of just being like a
street vendor to test this concept
because I think this um spin the wheel

[20:01]
because I think this um spin the wheel
concept just plays on our human emotion
of wanting to win prizes wanting to play
the lottery wanting to get rich quick
all right I love the visual aspect of it
especially if it were like super lit up
and bright and colorful and big like
outrageously big I tweeted about this
when I went to New York with my family a
year ago I'll try to put it in the show
notes where we were in New York just
outside of Time Square and there were
these immigrants with a platform that
had like a rotating arm that you put
your phone in and it plays that song on
repeat Welcome to New York right and you
pay 20 bucks and you stand on this
platform and it just spins around you
and takes a video and pictures yada yada
Y and I did a tweet about it and got
over a million views because these guys
are just cleaning up this platform cost
two grand on Amazon I don't think they
have to pay rent to be there on the
street I think they just have to get a
license they probably have to pay like a
one-time fee I'm totally guessing I
could be wrong but I don't think these

[21:01]
could be wrong but I don't think these
guys are paying like a thousand bucks a
month just to stand on the street
because it wasn't like a food truck or a
cart or anything they're just on the
street I like the idea of you doing that
exact same thing with this idea just to
see how it goes prove the concept I love
the idea of testing Concepts in
high-foot traffic areas like this
because you can get feedback
face-to-face super valuable super
relevant feedback immediately from
people that usually have money
um they're in New York and they're
either traveling there which means they
have money or they live there which
means at least they have enough money to
live there because it's very expensive
so thank you uh Mr Kroger for that idea
I've got another question here on
YouTube quiner 48 is it possible to
build a$ 1 million Revenue business in a
year absolutely it's possible it happens
all the time it happens every day the
quickest I built a 1 million Revenue
business was a matter of two weeks and
that's not an exaggeration I'm not this
isn't one of those Instagram videos
where I'm like flexing in front of

[22:01]
where I'm like flexing in front of
someone else's Lamborghini I actually
did I sold Bitcoin miners they were
$220,000 Bitcoin Miners and it was right
place right time I found product Market
fit I found a good supplier it was the
culmination of seven different
businesses that I had started in the
past which that is an argument for
starting a bunch of businesses and not
just doing one thing is you're able to
cross reference all these learnings and
so when you think about it a million
dollars in revenue is 50 $20,000 minor
50 minor that's it I sold 50 products
over the course of a couple weeks our
second month we did 4.3 million in the
month of November 2021 in one month our
second month we launched October 1st and
that was like 12% profit no funding we
all bootstrap so not we're not just
talking Topline this was profitable it's
great business and I still own that
business so yes it's very very possible
but you have to pick a business with
higher ticket size right I'm going to
say that until the I die maybe it's a

[23:00]
say that until the I die maybe it's a
pool company you sell $100,000 pools you
just need 10 okay can you do that um
maybe it's a um let's say a driveway
replacement company and your average
ticket size is $10,000 you need to sell
100 driveways okay so you find the older
neighborhoods that have cracked up
driveways and you start knocking on
doors or you pay people to knock on
doors and give him a $1,000 commission
um there's a zillion ways to make a
million dollar Revenue business in a
year the hard part is actually finding a
way to make a profit out of that because
when you see people online talking about
how much they made quote that's like the
worst business word in the English
language oh I made $4 million last year
they almost always mean Topline you
could have lost a million out of that
four so the hard part is getting it to
be profitable because there are many of
Silicon Valley companies that raised
many millions of dollars that took a
decade or more to be profitable or
raised nine fig figures and never became
profitable and went out of business so

[24:01]
profitable and went out of business so
optimize for profit and not Revenue all
right YouTube's picking up come on we
got any more questions from YouTube I
would much prefer live questions than
pres submitted ones but let's go to the
next one this is from byou Bayou wants
to buy two leaf blowers and a ladder
hire two people pick a neighborhood and
go door too offering to clean the pine
straw off of their roof right then plus
$25 to bag and leave on their curb okay
do I like this idea no I love this idea
it's a perfect idea right place right
time you want to find neighborhoods that
have the types of trees that are putting
pine straw or leaves on the roof um
you're right there most people don't
want to get on the roof um I actually
just cleaned my gutters myself I'd been
in my house for eight years I'd never
done it I'd never had it done um and if
someone would have just showed up at my
door I for sure would have paid him a
couple hundred bucks to do it um I don't
like the idea of you paying people do it
for you right off the bat I want you to

[25:00]
for you right off the bat I want you to
do it yourself right off the bat so you
can know all the little nuances what
does Betty say when you tell her the
price right what is your objection like
what are your counters to all of the
objections I want you to do it yourself
sell a 100 Doors make a little manual
and then start hiring people to do it or
else you're never going to know what the
most optimal way is to sell those
Services if someone that doesn't really
care about your business starts it from
day one
so you want to test this you got to test
it yourself I do the same thing to this
day and I always will and that testing
phase is the funest part okay someone on
YouTube asked how true do you find the
saying build the plane when you are
flying that's a th% true there's there's
no lie in that statement that's what I
do today it's what I did when I was 12
years old here's another question
Anthony if you started from zero with
extremely limited resources what type of
business would you start not a to cold
call I would love some sort of leg gen

[26:03]
call I would love some sort of leg gen
aspect I would start a home service
business it's the fastest way to put
cash money profit in your pocket period
and it's the fastest way to learn people
skills and it's the fastest way to learn
sales skills and it's a no-brainer
because you're selling services that
people are already in need of you're not
trying to convince them to buy a widget
impulsively this is something that
they're either going to pay someone to
do in the near future or that they're
going to have to go out and do in 100°
heat themselves so here's a second
option for you why do I keep looking
over there the camera's right there I
would flip stuff on Facebook Marketplace
or Craigslist there are entire
businesses of people that just flip
Furniture buy couch for 100 put in
storage unit sell for 500 I knew a guy
that owned a box truck and he started by
renting a U-Haul so he didn't even start
with that and all he did was flip
washers and dryers that's it
you think that guy is ever going to go
broke never he set up alerts on

[27:02]
broke never he set up alerts on
Craigslist anytime a washer was listed
and he didn't even have automations his
alert was his only automation he would
reach out to them manually and just
offer offer offer offer offer he would
just make a ton of offers and he there's
like 8 to 12 things that go wrong in a
washer or dryer that's the 8020 of it
right of course there are hundreds of
things that can go wrong but the 8020 of
it there's like 10 things that can go
wrong in a washer or dryer he learned
how to fix those 10 things himself on
YouTube he didn't Outsource it he had a
storage unit like a 10 by 20 or
something he would have his Tools in his
storage unit climate controlled he would
go out and buy washers and dryers for 50
to 200 bucks sometimes you get them for
free because the the people just need
them gone right they're like hey it's
broken I need it you know I just need it
gone and he knew that's probably a $50
part he would take them all back and he
would have a bunch of tools on a shelf
and he would just fix them up take
really nice pictures of them and sell
them and he just put a 100 bucks in his
pocket every time 100 200 250 50
sometimes sometimes he lose money but he

[28:01]
sometimes sometimes he lose money but he
made a six-figure income just washers
and dryers nothing else that is a good
first business to start if you were to
ever go to zero all right let's go back
to another pre-submitted question this
is from Brady Brady says I'd love to
create an AI tool that works as a repair
coach for automobiles could work for a
bunch of different things but this is
probably the one with the biggest Tam
Tam equals total addressable Market
eventually it would likely be video
enabled but it would be a tool that
could help you diagnose problems and
coach you through a repairing a vehicle
I know one of the challenges in these
industries is that people sometimes need
experience working on a specific type of
equipment but a tool like this would
enable them to do more without having
specific experience or training would
probably require lots of funding to
start but I'd love to see this I'd
actually like to do it with medical
repair okay
I like this idea I don't think you need

[29:01]
I like this idea I don't think you need
a bunch of funding to start you could
use a bunch of funding to grow it but
here's what I would do if I were you to
find product Market fit on this idea I
would find a very highly engage Facebook
group for something like 1983 Ford
Broncos literally something that
specific some a Facebook group of 10 to
50,000 people in it you'd be surprised
they're out there and these people are
in there all day talking about this
Bronco that they're fixing up yada yada
yada I would build build a tool
specifically for them take that manual
the Bronco manual and make U an llm out
of it using AI uh Claud open AI what
have you um and make like a chat bot
just make a chat bot for free make it
for free and then while you're building
this start getting active in the group
so you can get like a like a top
contributor badge in the Facebook group
um that will put push your visibility
more when you actually go to launch

[30:00]
more when you actually go to launch
something and launch a very specific
tool to a very specific audience and
then for free and just use it to get
feedback man I really wish there were
pictures like I I wish I could upload
pictures it's just text only like it
would really be helpful if yada or it's
like hey it's glitching out when every
time I ask it about the tires because
there's nothing in the manual about the
tires something you're going to get all
kinds of feedback use that to keep
building it out and then build it out
for another model and then start
charging for it um I guarantee you if
you do something like that and building
up traction start building up a
passionate um fan base you could raise
money for it 100% 1,000% we're going to
see all kinds of AI tools like this and
we already are or Niche products and
services this is a good idea this is a
stud another question from YouTube
Anthony says any hacks for Craigslist I
didn't realize the platform was still
relevant um
Anthony I would use a software called
Cubix Cubix I'm making sure there's a
sill around cubic solution there it is

[31:00]
sill around cubic solution there it is
this guy has been around for over a
decade Craigslist automation software if
you want to do stuff on Craigslist this
software costs like $4 I have no
affiliation but I've used it many times
I don't think it's I don't think it
works on Mac which kind of sucks it's a
great great software you can Auto email
people as soon as they list things you
can scrape stuff there are a zillion
ways even today to make a lot of money
on Craigslist let's go to a college
student submitted question okay Jennifer
has the idea for a travel website where
users will have the opportunity to
interact with locals from different
countries I also want to create
educational content to learn about their
cultures history etiquette and safety
while traveling in addition of virtual
travel experiences the platform will
also offer in-person tours for those who
prefer physical
exploration these tours will be curated
based on specific things themes such as
Cuisine history culture nature and more
these guided tours are within the city

[32:01]
these guided tours are within the city
state or even multiple States depending
on their interest I've been doing
customer Discovery researching
competition and working on my MVP which
means minimum viable product by offering
this platform I aim to promote cultural
understanding Foster connections with
people from diverse backgrounds and
Inspire curiosity about the world okay
travel website for people to connect
with the locals in addition to Virtual
travel experiences it will also off
offer in-person tours here's what I
think you do I think you start with a
travel website like this um to do what
you're saying start with one market kind
of like the idea I just the advice that
I just gave with the the AI idea start
with one very specific things maybe it's
uh it's Americans traveling to Bolivia
right start generating content about
that um you could use AI to generate it
I'm sure but then instead of offering
in-person tours I feel like you should
or I know you should monetize this by

[33:01]
or I know you should monetize this by
sending referrals to current tour
operators in Bolivia for percentage of
their revenue you don't want to be in
like the tour business and the content
creation business that should just be
how you monetize instead of banner ads
or or a monthly subscription use the
content to drive SEO drive very very
targeted traffic use something like
moz.com or some SEO research tool to
find which countries are people
researching information for that your
future competitors are not bidding on
keywords you can use that SEO research
to lead which country you start with or
which area maybe it's Tuscany maybe it's
all of Italy whatever it is find an area
that people are searching about there
there is an asymmetric amount of
information on the internet for travel
information about this area and then
there's an asymmetric amount of
competition for people bidding on those
keywords start building content around
that collect emails always collect

[34:00]
that collect emails always collect
emails okay you could create a
newsletter around this as well start
with just this one area make the name
broad but the area specific because
you're going to add more areas so you
don't want to pigeon hole yourself into
Tuscany tours.com or something and then
when you monetize use existing tour
operators to just send them traffic
because that's a high ticket item and
then just make affiliate fees referral
fees from that all right I've got a
student named Evan who submitted this
idea cont content creation and marketing
business I help entrepreneurs actively
participate and engage in the
synchronistic flow of life through
creative awareness coaching and mass
short form content creation recently
graduated from Temple University and now
I'm all in on my business Okay evan
here's what I love and here's what I
hate about this idea I love that you're
all in on this business love it okay
this is a business that has proven it's
going to work you're going to make it
work here's what I don't love I don't
love the phrase is synchronistic flow of
life through creative awareness coaching

[35:01]
life through creative awareness coaching
and mass short form content creation I
have no idea what that means that means
no one else has any idea what it means
it sounds smart but in in an effort to
sound smart you're sacrificing future
potential customers right I know I'm not
your customer right but I assume that if
you're pitching your idea this way that
you're pitching your customers in the
same way you want to speak and write on
a third grade reading level
because fourth and above reading level
equals friction and friction equals loss
of sales or profit okay sounds like
you're doing short form video content
creation or editing or your short form
video agency which is great we're still
in the early stages of that you're going
to crush it I would just change how you
sell it but it's a good idea and you're
already doing it so keep doing it okay
let's do one more question this person
did not leave a name but they said when
you are traveling you pay a small fee to
hang with people's pets in your hotel
tell for an
hour okay I assume you had this idea

[36:02]
hour okay I assume you had this idea
because you're a pet lover I have a pet
but I'm not a pet lover I don't like
this idea because I've never heard of
this idea before okay you can cringe all
you want but I stand by that statement I
don't like new ideas I maybe this isn't
new maybe someone's doing this right
I've been I've been surprised by pet
ideas over and over and over again all
right so just because of the fact that
this is a pet idea that sounds sounds
kind of dumb on the surface that
probably means that it's a good idea
okay because you're probably a pet
person and you probably had this need at
some point and as they say which I agree
with you should create businesses that
solve your own problems because that
means there's likely someone else out
there that has the same problems I would
never pay a fee to see someone else's
dog or cat while on vacation I just got
a vacation and I left my dog uh with a
border and I I love my dog but I didn't
miss him in fact I didn't really think
about him that much because I think
people are more important than dogs
period that's me that's doesn't mean you
should build the business around my
opinion I think you should test this

[37:01]
opinion I think you should test this
idea um in a very Niche way um I just
don't know that people are in the
mindset to to play with someone else's
pet when they're on vacation and they're
busy and they're hopping from thing to
thing or they just want to relax in a
hotel um so all else equal even when
considering the fact that a lot of pet
ideas that sound dumb are actually good
ideas because they become big businesses
and they're profitable setting all that
aside I just don't like this idea I
think this is a dud um but I think you
could test this idea relatively cheaply
and you should so you could get a chip
on your shoulder because of what I just
said and provve me wrong anyway thank
you all for joining me um I would love
to hear your business idea you can email
it to me Chrisco founders.com no dash
just coof founders.com and I'll do
another episode like this I hope you
learned something um I hope this was
good for you and thank you for joining
