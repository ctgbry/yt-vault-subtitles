look at this freaking thing right here
this guy in Thailand invented a bike
that enables him to be taken on a walk
by his dog while his dog gets exercised
this is not sold in Europe or the states
yet and in Thailand they actually race
on these things do I condone this no but
do I think there's something you can
take inspiration from here yes now what
plays to human nature better that
enables dogs to exercise and their
owners to be lazy get all my business
ideas right here for free
