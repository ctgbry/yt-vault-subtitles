we make money in six different ways at
this RV park that I'm at right here see
that clubhouse right there we rent that
out on the weekends for $100 an hour
with a $300 minimum you see that water
slide right there we charge $10 a day
per person for people to use the water
slide we're getting it repainted and
resealed in the offseason next summer
we're going to charge $60 per person per
day that'll bring residents from all
over Central Oklahoma and increase our
occupancy rate as a result RV parks are
a beautiful business
