behind him, Cameron, Missouri.
Population 8,500. And I found a little
pizza shop in the parking lot of a
hardware store. And this pizza shop
sells authentic Italian pizzas for $15
to $20 each. I need to go find out how
much money they make, how much it cost
to start the business, and how you could
copy this as well. And stick around
after this interview cuz I'm going to
bring you home to my kitchen and my
outdoor pizza oven and show you exactly
how to make pizza that will sell for 80
to 90% profit margin.
&gt;&gt; So, why don't you start by telling me
who you are and what you do? Uh, my name
is Clayton Bow. This is my wife, Haley
Bowman. We just started um a small pizza
business. Just a small part of it so
far.
&gt;&gt; We basically just got sick of coming
home every night and seeing each other
long enough to say good night and go
back to work. So, we decided to create
our own business. Uh, we're kind of both
jacks of all trades, but uh, one thing
that really stuck out to both of us and
we always have a good time doing is
cooking and being in the kitchen. From
there, it kind of just unraveled into
pizza is our favorite food. everybody.
It's something everybody can help with.
Uh we have three kids who all help out

[01:01]
Uh we have three kids who all help out
on the tent. Right now we're doing a
tent and we hope to work up to the truck
that's sitting in our driveway.
&gt;&gt; We got a 24 foot truck that we're
building right now. Good for you.
&gt;&gt; Trying to custom build it. It needs
quite a bit, but we're still working on
it. So that's the dream.
&gt;&gt; And where did you learn how to make
pizza like this?
&gt;&gt; Self taught. Usually we started two
years ago. And I mean our first pizza
was horrible. Terrible. Terrible. took
time and and we slowly got better and
better at it and over over some time,
you know, we perfected it.
&gt;&gt; What is an average day like as far as
volume is concerned in this parking lot?
&gt;&gt; Uh it's it's a little slower here.
Whenever we're not doing events, this is
just more like we're just trying to make
a decent living here. We might serve 30
to 40 people in a day just right here.
&gt;&gt; That's like $500, right?
&gt;&gt; If we do like 20 orders in a day, I
mean, that's usually about 600 to 700
bucks. 20% is cost and that's what food
costs. So then we probably have like
another 15% on, you know, all of our gas
and all of our other stuff. So we're
looking at, I would say, at least
roughly 60% profit is what awesome off

[02:01]
roughly 60% profit is what awesome off
of it.
&gt;&gt; And then what do you pay to be here?
&gt;&gt; They have been nice enough to just let
us come out. We just trade them for some
lunch every now and
&gt;&gt; Well, also like if you bring in people
for pizza, they might say, "Ah, I need
some hardware."
&gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
&gt;&gt; Symbiotic promoting each other.
&gt;&gt; That's the gist. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; How do events normally go as far as
volume or profits are concerned? Here's
the thing. We're This is going to be our
first event.
&gt;&gt; We did one for Fourth of July. That one
was a little bit smaller. This is a
larger hopefully event.
&gt;&gt; Thousand bucks is the goal at least.
&gt;&gt; That'd be cool. That'd be a dream. But
yeah. So, uh
&gt;&gt; I mean, we've made I mean, we've made
that here. There's been some nights
we've made over a thousand just sitting
under
&gt;&gt; sitting right here. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Kids come help. They're usually
here full-time with us cuz we homeschool
or we do alternative school. We
basically just all travel together. So,
the goal is to work into your trailer,
open a brick and mortar restaurant.
What's the goal?
&gt;&gt; Well, the goal is to Well, we we
definitely want to get into our food
truck. It's already built. We just got
to start putting all the appliances and
the and the big woodfired oven in and
all that stuff. Once we get that done,

[03:01]
all that stuff. Once we get that done,
we do want to open up a brick and
mortar. Well, that's mainly for so that
we don't have to deal with being in a
commissary kitchen
&gt;&gt; and then we can have our always have
dough readily available. Not necessarily
open up a brick and mortar to do pizza.
We want to actually open up a brick and
mortar to be uh a bakery and then run
all of our dough out of the bakery cuz
eventually we want to have multiple food
trucks that we're running out of.
&gt;&gt; Yep. They'll all be ran out of ours.
This is 10 year 15 year dream. But yeah,
that's that's the goal for this place.
Yeah, that's what we see when we look at
it.
&gt;&gt; If someone is watching this in another
state and they say, "I want to sell
pizzas." What advice would you give
them? What what headaches could they
avoid based on what you've learned?
&gt;&gt; Take your time and start local and then
work your way out to the state.
&gt;&gt; Okay? And you don't got to buy brand new
starting out. Y get started and you know
slow slowly buy the stuff as you need it
cuz if not you're going to just be
sitting and waiting a long time. So I
think that was a big thing I learned. I
tried to say oh I need everything brand
new instead. You know to be honest
everything here was brand new but it
took a longer process.

[04:00]
took a longer process.
&gt;&gt; I'm thinking we should have just got
whatever.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. If we would have gotten you know
just used stuff and we probably would
have gotten out a little quicker and
been promoting oursel a little quicker.
Probably would have helped us out a
little bit. And then slowly as we're
building the company, then you start
replacing the, you know, the certain
stuff that you need to replace.
&gt;&gt; Okay. What's your most popular uh pie?
&gt;&gt; If we're talking red sauce on the pie,
people really like the pepperoni and the
green peppers. If you're going to get an
Alfredo pizza, it's going to have to be
sausage with probably I'd say mushroom
is usually the go-to with that.
Sometimes banana peppers if you like it
spicy or zesty. So,
&gt;&gt; well, I need to order one.
&gt;&gt; Absolutely. Let's get Let's get you
going.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
[Music]
There's a guy, I think he's called

[05:00]
There's a guy, I think he's called
Doughboy. He's in the UK. He makes
thousands of dollars a day with two of
these in a little trailer in the UK.
this guy in uh California, he works at
two farmers markets every weekend. He's
a full-time professor, and on the
weekends, he's making $175,000 in net
profit slanging pizzas on the weekend.
All right, so I ended up with eight 200
g dough balls. I've already eaten one,
so we're going to start with number two.
You want to be sure that the entire
dough ball is covered with this mixture.
This is 50% double zero flour, 50%
cornmeal.
Now, the most important part is you
don't want to touch the edges. The
reason that people use their fists to
flatten it out is because you're
basically letting the weight of the
dough do all the work for you, right?
So, you're just going to take your
fingers and your fist and you're going
to kind of naturally stretch it out like
that. Some people like to put it down
here and press it outward. That's just
not my style. You can see I'm being very
careful to not pinch the outer edge

[06:01]
careful to not pinch the outer edge
because you want it to puff up. That's
why you would never take a rolling pin
to this bad boy. If you do end up
pushing it out from the uh countertop,
then you want there to be plenty of this
flour cornmeal mixture. That's about how
it should look. It could be a little
bigger. I could be thinner in the
middle. You can see right there. You can
kind of see through the center of it.
Kind of like parchment paper. That's how
you want it to be. Now, I'm going to go
ahead and get my peel. One of the
trickier parts of this whole process is
getting the thing on and off the peel.
So when it comes time for me to put the
sauce on it, I prefer to put it on the
peel at that point. So we'll put it on
there. You can see it's the crust is
nicely elevated. You're usually putting
less sauce on there.
So that is just about right. And then
I'm using this fresh mozzarella right
here.
So I'm going to give the old shake test.
All right, cool. That tells me that when
I uh put it in the oven, I'm going to be

[07:01]
I uh put it in the oven, I'm going to be
okay. It's going to come off. All right.
All right. So, we're here on the Gaussy,
and this display will turn off every 20
minutes or so just to preserve battery.
So, we'll turn it back on. Look at the
temp. 836. Perfect. Anything over 800 is
good enough for me. When it starts
getting to 925, turn that sucker down.
So, if you get up in there, if you want
to look up in there, see how the flame
comes across the top? Looks awesome. All
right. So, you want to angle it down?
You just want to kind of jerk it.
Perfect. So, the pizza peel is cooking
it from the bottom up and then the flame
at the top is cooking it from the top
down. And now I'm going to get this
little bad boy and uh as soon as it
starts to look a little too dark on the
side closest to the flame, I'm going to
get in there and you just kind of you
kind of lift up one side. Jerking it.
You just kind of lift up a side and then
move it to the right or left. So, we've
got some really even browning in there.
Oh, yeah. That looks great.
It cooks in about 60 to 90 seconds. And
you see how it's puffing up on the
edges? That's because I didn't pinch the

[08:00]
edges? That's because I didn't pinch the
edges.
All right. Now,
there we go. Look at that. So, it's a
little smaller than I'd like because I I
didn't quite get it as thin as the uh
the experts might, but let's bring it in
and uh give it a taste.
So, this is a 65% hydration dough. 1
kilogram of flour, 65 g of water, 25 g
of salt, 2 g of yeast, little splash of
olive oil. Mix it all up together, let
it sit on the counter for an hour, cover
it, put it in the fridge for 2 days,
pull it out, split it into eight
sections, put it in your proofing box,
and then about 2 hours later, it's warm,
it's risen a little bit, and it's good
to go. So, we'll cut this one into
fourths.
That is
beautiful. So, if it were 70% hydration,
it'd be a lot more airy. The crust would
be bigger, and you can see all the
moisture there. This is pretty wet, but
frankly, I don't mind it. I think it's

[09:01]
frankly, I don't mind it. I think it's
going to be delicious no matter what.
So, time for the big reveal, which
you've all been waiting for.
I got the basil, but my taste buds don't
care. Go start a dang pizza business
already. Your taste buds will thank you
for
