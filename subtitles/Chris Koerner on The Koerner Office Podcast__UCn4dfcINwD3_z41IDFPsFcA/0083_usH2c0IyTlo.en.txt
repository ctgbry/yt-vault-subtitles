[00:00]
what some people are thinking right now
well it's just stupid just put salt in
another different packaging yes
sometimes it can be that easy it can
literally be that easy look at 5 Hour
Energy oh you're just taking an energy
drink and put it on the counter dud yes
it's a billion dollar company look what
liquid death yeah a billion dollar and
marketing Framing and marketing that's
it yeah that's why I like it right
that's why the Salty Dog name is like oh
yeah that's
[Music]
genius I went to Capital camp this week
and like the best way to describe
Capital Camp is a place for
investors and people who are looking to
raise funds to meet it's a networking
event there's three types of people
there's investors there's entrepreneurs
who are looking to raise money and then
there's entrepreneurs who are just going
to network I went to network and
honestly it's expensive it's $10,000 a
person but wait what there's no it's not
yeah it's technically it's 13,500 per
person no it's not but they do they have
like little are you trolling me did you
actually pay that

[01:00]
actually pay that
did you not know this is this a bit is
this like you're trying to make people
laugh that are listening no no this is
real I thought it was $3,000 are you
serious yeah remember when you and I
were going back and forth texting each
other and you were like I can't believe
you didn't bring this up to me this was
one of the reasons I didn't bring it up
to you cuz it's $133,000 to go to it's
not 13,000 I swear like tell me right
now are you trolling no I'm not trolling
I swear oh my God $13,000 I got a
discount code I didn't pay 13,000 what
did you pay 10 I'm not telling you what
I paid
oh my gosh I'm not I revoke everything I
said about having fomo I'm so glad I did
not go to that do you know how many
businesses I could start with 10 or
$133,000 that's 13 businesses do you
know how many hypoallergenic cats my
wife could buy two yeah cuz she just
bought them it's awesome what she just
bought cats we just bought two
hypoallergenic cats for 5,000 a piece
oh okay I couldn't wait to tell you that

[02:00]
oh okay I couldn't wait to tell you that
this was a weird way to introduce this
whole conversation anyways okay anyways
we'll talk about that later so Capital
Camp there's like already an initial
filter right can you afford to go to
Capital Camp how many were there there's
350 people there this is what I wanted
to go through this with you the math
with you right I I can't help but do
some of the back of the envelope math
right you just start thinking about
things you're like all right 350
attendees average cost $10,000 $3.5
million in Revenue
any were there any sponsors no well I
shouldn't say that not that I know of
and it wasn't noticeable for there could
be sponsors there I mean you better not
have sponsors if you're charging that
much come on well and the thing I liked
about this conference is it was it was
fantastic it was by far the best
conference or event I've ever been to
okay now Ian I I'll go through I'll go
through these but like the first thing I
wanted to do was kind of break down the
economics of capital Camp so 350 50

[03:00]
economics of capital Camp so 350 50
people $10,000 a pop 3.5 million in
revenue for 4 days essentially 3 and a
half days but 4 days but then I started
going through the costs I'm like all
right 350 people three and a half nights
$350 a night $450,000 for lodging cool
food I said $100 per meal per person per
day so three meals a day three and a
half days
$375,000 they had to rent the venues
$250,000 transp but why are you
including lodging do they pay for your
lodging yeah yeah it was all included
once we got there where everything
stayed at this hotel called like the
Stony Brook Inn or something it was
actually funny there's two super niiz
hotels that they had people stay at
close to the event and then there's a
hotel really far away out in the
Boondocks that sucked and I didn't know
it sucked until I they have a mix and
mingle or whatever at one of the hotels
it's probably random right they probably
don't place people at certain hotels I
go in the freaking hotel and it's like
marble up flooring beautiful wood
mahogany bookcases lining the walls as

[04:00]
mahogany bookcases lining the walls as
you enter like it's just very
Cosmopolitan feeling super nice the
Stony Brook in looks the way it sounds
it's like a nice Motel eight right like
it's dumpy beat up yeah it is what it is
anyways I talked to one of the people
who were putting on the camp and I got
some back in the envelope numbers
basically it was like
$11,000 per head per day for the
staff now that includes like the
planning the marketing
coordinating Logistics all that stuff
and so when I added everything up the
total cost of the event was about $3
million so you have like total money
coming in 3.5 total cost event three so
let's just say they made $500,000 on it
now $500,000 is not a little sum of
money it's it's a little margin to most
people that's what I was going to say
like for this like the point of it was
not to make money off of this event the
point of it is to promote equity and for

[05:01]
point of it is to promote equity and for
there to be deal flow and like to be the
thought leader in the space so as I'm
there I knew telling you those numbers
and make you throw up so that's why I
was so excited I have many thoughts so
please proceed all right as I was there
it got me thinking about this thesis
that we've had for a while is that
events and premium events in particular
are going to become more and more
sought-after we're benefiting from two
Tailwinds one is co everybody worked
from home it's been really hard to get
people back to the office
and remote work has persisted and
because of that companies have larger
budgets they can spend on these types of
things and then we're also benefiting
from social media like people are all on
their phones so when you go and have
real inperson experiences they're
they're fantastic I this is my fourth
conference this year I went to we had a
tree trimming we had a tree trimming
boot camp we had SM bash that we went to
Capital camp and then I'm going to
another conference for convert kit in a
week it's it's obvious there's a craving
for like networking and community

[06:00]
for like networking and community
and as I was there I'm going to give you
some examples it was the best event I've
ever been to because they cared about
every little detail so it was in by only
first of all you felt special High
ticket price so you're already like okay
I'm expecting a lot I check in they knew
my name and they knew a little bit about
me like it was obvious they had either
looked at my LinkedIn or they read my
bio like somehow they knew some stuff
about me like they made some comments
that I mean it does cost $133,000 to do
a LinkedIn search so that does make
sense the girl comes up to me when I
first check and I have my water bottles
this much water left she's like would
you like me to throw that away and get
you a new water kind of get you a little
refresher I'm like uh yeah absolutely
that probably took $2,000 over time uh
you're going to do this the whole time
aren't you oh this is my bit now also
can you be very clear that we are not
this is not an ad for Capital camp
they're not paying us no no no no this
isn't an ad for Capital Camp if they're
paying you they ain't paying
me the swag so they had all this swag
right like and it said Capital Camp

[07:00]
right like and it said Capital Camp
there was shirts and hats and bags and
all this stuff and when you went in they
said swag's free take however much you
want now obviously you and I look at it
and we're like paid for that swag I grew
up poor do you know what you're doing
here I'm gonna I'm GNA clothe my family
for three years but there's like this
psychological check that happens where
it's like they said take as much as you
want but most people are going to be
like I don't want to be that guy yeah
you know like they did do you remember
how many peanut M&M I came home with
from Main Street I'm still eating those
Peanut M&M's I literally am they had
more food there this time than even
don't tell me this it was amazing and
like one of the other small touches was
there you were never sitting by yourself
alone unless you wanted to be like so if
you had your headphones in nobody bugged
you but there was a number of times
where I sat down because all the tables
were full or I didn't know anybody and
one of the Camp staff members came up
and they just started talking to me hey
how's it going where you from because
they want you to feel included and
special and that like you're having a

[08:01]
special and that like you're having a
good time now for an introver like you
obviously it's one of your worst
nightmares but I just thought it was
exceptionally well done I thought it was
exceptionally well done and it's got me
on this continuing on this kick of like
conferences boot camps Live in-person
Events are not the future but they're
going to be very popular over the next
few years all right you got to go full
Andrew Wilkinson when you describe it
and be like it was beautiful it was it's
a beautiful business purchased at a fair
price it was a great business valued at
a fair price it wasn't a cigarette
butt it no it was it was it was a really
well put on function and again it
reminded me of the boot camps that we
did like we could do more of these boot
camps there's a lot of opportunity I
think in the space for Live Events yeah
all right go I want to hear your
feedback first of all I went to Texas
Roadhouse last week and the server was
helping us and then the manager comes by
and he's like is everything okay you
guys doing okay and he left and I was

[09:00]
guys doing okay and he left and I was
like while he was there I was like uhuh
uhuh uhuh uhuh uhuh okay and then he
left and I'm like oh I just I don't want
to be talked to I I don't want to go to
Texas Roadhouse to make friends with a
server and a manager and a bus boy and a
host I was just triggered when you said
that Chris checks into Texas Roadhouse
and he's like yeah so here's what's
going to make this a good night don't
look at me don't talk to me don't think
about me don't even fart in my general
direction because I will sue this
company faster than you can say what hey
how's everyone doing tonight oh good 15%
I'm sorry sir what oh that's just what
your tip dropped to uhhuh oh I'm sorry
oh 10% 10 what is that
oh could that be a bit should that be a
bit could be a bit let's do it write it
down all right so first of
all I hear you I agree with you to an
extent sounds awesome and what I'm about
to say is biased because I wasn't there
and I have half fomo half glad I wasn't
there I feel like whenever there's
something expensive the business owner
is much more likely to be like listen

[10:01]
is much more likely to be like listen
we're just this is a passion project
we're just I mean like we're lucky to
break even on this you know how many
times I've heard that crap I'm sick of
it I remember when Sam par launched
Hampton and he did a beta group and he
beta there it is I literally I had to
wait for
it and he emailed me for with a cly link
and I never took it but he's like hey uh
this is five grand and it's I think it's
10 grand now per year and he's like but
I don't make any money on that it's just
I'm just trying to learn and I'm like
dude it's $5,000 to join a club and your
cost is a zoom membership dude just be
real with me dude we're all capitalist
just tell me you're making good money or
don't tell me anything about it just own
the price like either own it or own how
much money you're making but none of
this like I'm just I Do It For the Love
of the Game we're lucky to break even I
just don't like that what does that have
to do with capital Camp because that's
what they said to you they're like yeah
it's $1,000 dollar a day and so you were
able to back end into the math and they
know that other people are going to be

[11:00]
know that other people are going to be
doing that it's called Capital camp but
it's like I I don't believe that they
only made 500,000 you don't think that
the Staffing cost $1,000 a day no I
think you could like you could crunch it
in a certain way where it would appear
as such but I just I'm more speaking to
the overall principle of that just own
your prices just own
it okay so you think it was like a big
money maker that's the point of them
doing it they put you in a $13 per night
Hotel hotel that I would have booked
right which that's a problem
MH yeah I don't disagree with you keep
going anyway but it is very interesting
the larger point of charging a lot of
money for a high touch conference like
that because it speaks to the point that
you and I make about having the the
value exceed the cost right hey can I
refill your water the cost of that is
almost nothing but the value is like but
the value yeah so I I respect that and I
like that are you g to change topics yes
I just thought it spoke to their company

[12:01]
I just thought it spoke to their company
ethos I thought it was like very well
representative of them as a company I I
think it's smart of them to try to
position themselves as a connector
within that world again I think they
made money but I don't think that like
to me the purpose of this if you've got
a company that's doing $20 million a
year in iida and this event makes you
$600,000 or a million dollars like
you're not putting this event on because
it's like oh this is the main money
driver right there's other uses of that
capital that you could do to me it it
just signals that they're being very
smart and strategic longterm they're
doing this to position themselves well
so they can get more deal flow so they
can be at the center of attention and
attraction that's smart it's smart it's
smart I I was just thinking of
hypotheticals as you were talking so I
actually wasn't listening that closely
but I just thinking like you go back in
a year and you it's in Columbia right
where the University of Missouri is and
you're like we're going to take you on a
tour of the campus and show you
something and you see that the library
is like named after you because
your $113,000 contrib it's like the most

[13:02]
your $113,000 contrib it's like the most
money Columbia Missouri has ever seen in
their lifetime ever I will caveat that I
know Brent bishaw is a good guy and he's
honest I don't doubt that he's doing the
right thing and I think it's very smart
of them to have another event six months
later that cost a small fraction of that
right agreed all right well I got some
ideas some of these are stupid they're
stupid in a way that the pet rock is
stupid and that it could make you a lot
of money and everyone's going to think
you're an idiot for starting a business
like this but then you'll get the last
laugh I got this idea today I went on a
50 m bike red and yes I am
flexing I didn't have to say the
distance but I Can Go the Distance so I
came off from this bike ride covered in
sweat my dog comes up to me and he just
starts licking me and he always does
that and it's like oh yeah okay you you
need some electrolytes you need some
that's what he needs he just wants the
salt right dog electrolytes okay I like
that exactly and so let me get there

[14:01]
that exactly and so let me get there
though let me I I got to walk you there
okay I love my dog but I'm not like a
dog person right you know me right like
yeah it's kind of like kids I love my
kids a lot other people's kids you're
not a kid person whatever right well I
actually can't am but anyway dogs are
just fine they're fine legally you're
not allowed to be within 600 feet of a
school well uh edit that out Mom that's
all I
meant don't actually edit that out by
the way he's so confused right now
anyway so he starts licking me and I'm
like okay if I were like a dog person
and I had that same thought I'm going to
be thinking oh you poor thing we need to
get you some more salt oh does your dog
food not have enough salt that's how dog
people are that's what you would think
yes you would just think oh you're a dog
you lick
everything no I'm saying if I were a dog
person like a dog empath okay and then I
had the same realization that maybe he's
licking me because he needs electrolytes
okay all right yeah then I might make

[15:00]
okay all right yeah then I might make
the connection oh I feel so bad for you
because you don't have enough
electrolytes therefore I'm not doing a
good enough job as your dog owner got it
you with me okay yep I'm with you and so
it's
like dog electrolytes Salty Dog that's
what I'm calling it okay and here's what
it is that's a very good name it's a
very and my wife thought of it it's a
very good name so we were in the car and
I brought this up to her and I'm like
all right give me I need a business name
for dog electrolytes where you
incorporate like dog into the word
electrolytes some and she's just like
salty
dog and I'm like you are you're you're
brilliant freaking Rainman over there
can we go home real quick it was
anyway here's here's what you could do
you could literally get you know what
light salt is no it's 50% salt 50%
potassium which is like 2/3 of
electrolytes then you need throw some
magnesium in there that's basically
electrolytes salt potassium and
magnesium you could literally just take
that and put it in a a like a salt
shaker and they do sell these I Googled

[16:01]
shaker and they do sell these I Googled
it but it there weren't a lot of search
results and they have like dog chews for
electrolytes and there was like one or
two products as all I think there's a
world where you could literally just put
powdered electrolytes salt pottassium
magnesium in a Shaker and just have
people shake it on the dog food when
they shake it like a salt shaker exactly
what do you think Salty
Dog what so this is going to
be just cuz I'm not in this world at all
like we as humans don't we try to watch
our sodium intake we try to watch our
salt intake like are there any I don't
know secondary health impacts to the dog
are they going to get like heart disease
are they going to should oh dude we send
a card bur with burning dogs we send a
card with the potassium for burning dogs
that say Hey look when your dog dies
don't be salty call burning
dogs it's vertical integration it is I
think it's a great idea thank you thank
you I'm going to get ahead of what some
people are thinking right now well it's

[17:00]
people are thinking right now well it's
just stupid just put salt in another
different packaging yes sometimes it can
be that easy it can literally be that
easy look at Five Hour Energy oh you're
just taking an energy drink and put it
on the counter dude yes it's a billion
dooll company look at liquid death yeah
a billion dollar and marketing Framing
and marketing that's it yeah that's why
I like it right that's why the Salty Dog
name is like oh yeah that's genius it's
an easy product to sell people will get
it right away and it's yeah I like it I
think it's great thank you yeah it's
clean I've got a list of ideas that got
away right I don't regret not starting a
lot of things because I start so many
things there's only so much time but one
thing that I should have started was
like dog seasoning I have this idea like
I will remember you no this is the
background music for you to tell this
idea I don't know you're putting me in a
bad mood dog seasoning okay and eat the

[18:01]
bad mood dog seasoning okay and eat the
dog it's like this this El okay okay am
is that not right I thought that's what
you oh my gosh I didn't know where you
going that uh to feed the dog on top of
his food right because they eat the same
thing every day and once again I'm not a
dog empath but if I were I'd feel bad
for them to have having to eat the same
thing every day yeah because we're
imputing our own emotions onto them yes
they don't give R you know I buy that
cheap dog food you already know I do
and so I had I I had this idea like a
decade ago and it didn't exist and now
it's a thing my friend it is a thing and
it's it's pretty much too late for that
one you dude you've always been early
honestly you've always been early with
these ideas you go and like your wife
says you always don't I won't
say it's like the idea do you remember I
remember calling you in 2010 when I was
at USC and I was like Chris Chris Chris
Chris Chris what would you think if on
your wrist instead of it being a watch

[19:00]
your wrist instead of it being a watch
it was like a smartphone that sent you
notifications you could wear it on your
wrist I vaguely remember that and it
would have your email and your text and
it would show up and you're like that's
stupid no one would ever no that's dumb
nobody wants that no one would ever wear
it sometimes we're too early we're too
early that's right we're smart guys I
freaking love that what else what else
you got uh so you could do if we're
talking about too early for dog
seasoning you could penetrate that
market with Salty Dog
get in a bunch of households and say hey
second product line seasoning you could
go about it that way maybe we're not too
you know what you would call the
seasoning
right yeah I know but I want I have a
great name for it but I want to hear
yours because it's probably dumb doggy
style okay this is this is a
kid-friendly
podcast this is a kid-friendly podcast
tell me that wouldn't be a good name
tell me it wouldn't be a good
name it's a it's memorable it' be Inc
name it'd be an incredible name it would

[20:01]
name it'd be an incredible name it would
be
my dude think about the commercial oh my
gosh think about the commercial your
dog's name is Frank Frank loves doggy
style okay Frank's favorite doggy style
this is a kids
podcast this is kidfriendly do you
remember do you remember that Kmart
commercial where it was like free
shipping ship your pants I can ship my
pants yeah you can ship your pants right
now I just shipped my drawers yes
that was uh Kmart's Hail Mary into
staying relevant it was such a good ad
though it was such a good ad it fell at
the four yard line we need to find
whoever did that ad and do that ad for
doggy
style okay I'm ready be right
back the reason I like like for real
though the reason I like this space is
because people's empathy towards their
pets and the importance of pets in
people's families is growing like crazy
people having less kids they had they
got more pets during Co
and they're treating these pets like

[21:00]
and they're treating these pets like
their family members they have more
disposable income they can buy them
different types of foods they can get
them you know salty drinks because their
electrolytes are low there's a reason
why vet clinics are booming there's pet
insurance for Health Care obviously
you've got pet cremation now yeah yeah
pet cremation now because people want to
take care of their dogs after they pass
respectfully like it it's a real thing
so I love thinking about ideas that are
writing Tailwinds you're not inventing a
market you're looking at a market that's
taking off and saying what could I do in
this market that's it's already taking
off how can I ride this wave and you
come up with some of these ideas like
Salty Dog there you go did please tell
me you already bought the domain I
hadn't even are you surpr I'm sure I'm
sure saltydog.com has taken it's got to
be unless it's Salty Dawg I think I've
seen 13 seafood restaurants called salty
dogs so I'm sure the domain is
but Salty
Dog could call it salty dogs with a z

[22:00]
Dog could call it salty dogs with a z
Salty Dog seasoning. comom is open wait
no it's not open anyway let's move on
anyways let's move on I got another one
you ready go
yeah okay
so do you know what a bomb calorimeter
is no it sounds like something that I
don't know a scientist would have yes it
is very good I found this very
interesting basically the science of how
many calories are in food
okay do you know how a bomb calorimeter
works I'm assuming it somehow measures
the amount of calories in food but yeah
but like the mechanics of it extremely
interesting so no idea let's say you
take a plate of spaghetti and meatballs
okay you want to know how many calories
are on that plate exactly hey how many
calories are in on my plate of me the
balls so you take the food power this is
the power through it segment

[23:00]
the power through it segment
you take the food and you dehydrate it
you get all the water out okay then you
grind it down to a powder why wouldn't
you just not made the spaghetti why
wouldn't you just done it before you
made the spaghetti hear me out okay okay
okay okay what if you're anyway just
hear me
out you dehydrate it you grind it down
into a powder and then you press it into
a pill form like a capsule okay tiny
tiny form and then you put it in a it's
like a cylinder a metal cylinder that
has like a I don't know I don't remember
chemistry like a I don't know something
coming out of it and you measure the
energy the calories that it burns off
and you burn it you light it on fire
inside that cylinder and it keeps all
the heat in there Mees measures the heat
the amount of energy emitted from that
okay oh I didn't know that yeah so if
you grind up a salad it's not going to
get that hot in there if you grind up a
bag of potato chips a lot of calories in
that right yeah there's a lot of recent

[24:01]
that right yeah there's a lot of recent
data that shows how inaccurate nutrition
label facts are and I saw this myself in
trying to manufacture uh busy juice
there's very little oversight on what
people put on the ingredient label and
the nutrition label not there is
oversight of course the FDA right
there's not as much as you might think
it's not an exact science exactly and I
think there's a growing body of people
that want to know what they're eating
right they want to know what they're
putting in their bodies
and so right now you can't just go to
Amazon and buy a calorimeter and it's
technical it's expensive it's kind of
weird it's usually done in a lab if we
want to manufacture food we send it off
to a lab and they do it for us I think
there's a version where you can take
this and put it in homes it's not going
to be quite as accurate it's going to be
simplified like an iPhone and people can
buy it it will start with the health
freaks right and then work its way down
to more popularity and people can get
like let's say you have a meal eat every
day and you want to know how many

[25:00]
day and you want to know how many
calories in that meal so every time you
eat it you can you know it's consistent
you could measure the calories in your
food and I think it'd be cool for kids I
think it'd be cool for health freaks
losing weight all that what do you think
to quote the back street
boys tell me why I don't get why that
you would do this because there's a
market for it it's not well you hear me
out it's not going to be 100% accurate
anyways it's not going to be accurate
for every single meal it could be I
guessed at that it it could be very
accurate it's not it's not 100% accurate
it's telling you what the calories were
for that meal that you dehydrated and
burned but it's not necessarily for
every meal that you do maybe there's
different weights maybe I I don't know
anyways beyond that it it's
directionally correct which is
essentially the labeling on the back of
a piece of food like it's directionally
correct like why do the extra work to be
a little bit closer it's not telling you
necessarily anything that different
like what are we talking about here need

[26:01]
like what are we talking about here need
you to be a yes man here and just agree
with everything I think it's actually a
really good idea you know what I would
call it what's that
D's oh
gosh listen they can't all be bangers
but I think there is a there's a market
for this and there is precedent for
things being done in a lab like on a
niche scale and then coming more
mainstream no here's what I will say I
think that food in particular is
something that people are looking at a
lot more especially as ials people our
age are getting to a place where they
have more disposable income they're
looking at what they put into their body
like we grew up on gushers and
microwavable food and Lunchables and you
look at the science now and the amount
of plastic parts per million in our
blood is incredible they're finding
plastic like in people's testicles
they're finding plastic in the cells of
our B what that's what it is never mind
in Our arteries like they're finding all
these Plastics in our food and so people
are are looking at this and saying we

[27:01]
are are looking at this and saying we
got to do something different really
like we got to re-engineer the way that
we package food the way we prepare food
the way we ship food the way that we
feed the animals who we eat right like
it's not just about the end User it's
about what was done Upstream so I think
what you're identifying is definitely a
growing trend of people who are
interested in what they put in their
body I just don't know how many people
are like you I think you would buy
something like this for sure I just
don't know how big the market would be I
agree it's a small Market but I think if
like you develop products for yourself
right that is the best way to develop a
business or a product to solve your own
problem so if I had a ton of time on my
hands I would do this I I have no desire
to do this right and I just know just
because of the law of large numbers that
there would be a small market for that
and based on the precedent of other
things being sold like this it would
slowly expand and it would become more
mainstream I have an idea off of your
idea that I think is genius are you
ready for this uhhuh I'm going to take
it totally different
Direction I think there's a YouTube

[28:01]
Direction I think there's a YouTube
channel that would could be created of
you taking
meals B and then comparing the labeling
of calories dehydrating it getting it
down burning it and then actually
measuring the calories that would be a
cool YouTube channel like that's such a
good idea it has to exist right it
probably doesn't because I've actually
gone down YouTube rabbit holes for this
stuff and I didn't see anything like
mainstream that is a really good idea
because then then you have a YouTube
channel that people are watching and you
can sell products through your YouTube
channel that you care about like food
right like then you then you are tapping
into the broader Market of people who
care about what they're putting into
their bodies and and you had decided
like hey this would be cool for kids to
do I think like kids would really like
that like my boys would love to watch a
YouTube channel about that where it's
like all right tonight we're making
pizza this is what the store says and
it's like and you like list everything
out now we're going to dehydrate it and
you just go through the process film it
anyways I I think that could be a really
cool content Channel can I give you some
more examples of things like this that
went mainstream it's the pope Catholic

[29:02]
went mainstream it's the pope Catholic
infrared thermometers those started out
in industrial and scientific app
applications it's like why do I need a
different thermometer this one works
great those are popular now pH this m PH
meters right they were used in Labs now
they're used for all kinds of things who
would have thought that we want to know
what the pH is in our pool don't we have
a pool guy for that people want to know
spectr photometers
spectrometers all right they were used
in labs to measure the amount of light
that a chemical substance absorbs and
now they're used in the food industry UV
sterilization right sterilizing the UV
that UV sterilization have you seen that
product that was on Shark Tank that you
put your phone in there and with u light
it disinfects it right that was there's
one Giger counters they measure
ion ion ionizing radiation look if
you're going to cite these things at
least be able to pronounce them ionizing
radiation is what they met measure okay
now there is a market for buying these

[30:01]
now there is a market for buying these
on Amazon okay for what what do people
use those for just Lear they're like in
the Ukraine they're near Chernobyl
they're like how many I need to me the
Gregory why do you have a goer growing
on your
neck measuring radiation also things
that like like you said about
microplastics there's going to be a
world where
these these laborat tools are sold to
the General Public
so I that's what I think cool all right
I got a topic I want to ask you about
you ready let's go let's hear it so
Chris and I's experience is very
different Chris has experienced
launching and creating businesses from
scratch my experience has been in buying
and growing and selling businesses and
one place in particular that we just
have very different amounts of knowledge
I.E Chris knows a lot about it and I
don't is in digital marketing and and so
we've actually been like you and I been
talking a lot about digital agency
potentially even launching one for the

[31:00]
potentially even launching one for the
back of our audiences but have you seen
this thing that Google just rolled out
last week AI summaries yes so Google
traditionally you type something into
Google and it will either well it'll do
both it'll show people who have paid to
be at the top of that search or it'll
show search items that have gotten there
organically and in last week I listen to
all in about this did you last week I
did yeah yeah it was really good and so
last week they rolled out this thing
using Gemini their artificial
intelligence where it's like actually
giving answers to people and so SEO
traditionally search engine optimization
these small and medium businesses would
build their websites in a way that made
them trustworthy right they would do
their layout make sure that it loaded
fast anything and everything to build
trust but one of the biggest ways they
built trust was through content and so
you would have a lot of content on your
site either blog posts or social media
or just parts of your web page that

[32:01]
or just parts of your web page that
explain things that Google could then go
and scrape and say oh this website has a
lot of this information they rank higher
because they're more trustworthy they
also have all these backlinks to other
websites right there it was a whole game
that you would play and SEO in
particular has been one of the best ways
for organic traffic to come to
websites so my question to you because I
don't understand this stuff really well
how do you see this impacting
small businesses because we've seen
unlimited roll out which is Sam Thompson
and and Steven ol man's company and
they're focused on the longtail keywords
it would seem to me that if Google is
spitting out answers to these questions
and they're not allowing people to go
click through the organic search results
it's taking away the opportunity to grow
organically without having to do the
paper in fact this may actually be
better for Google because you have to
actually pay for the ad space as on
Google longer too right right and now

[33:00]
Google longer too right right and now
for a business owner like I got to pay
in order to rank as opposed to just the
organic rank now I don't think it takes
away from G geography but anyways you
are like miles ahead of me in my
knowledge of this it seems like a big
deal to me what do you think of it it
seems like a huge deal I don't know
what's going to happen I think Google
was really worried for years and rightly
so that AI was just going to crush them
and now they're probably thinking oh
this could be really good for us right
and right it it happened a few years ago
when basically Google would give you a
summarized
answer that they would pull from a
website and then give you the source but
think about how much time you actually
spend on google.com when you search for
something sometimes a millisecond the
results pop up you click immediately how
much time are you going to be spending
on Google once they put everything you
need right there versus all these other
websites that's what's really
interesting about this is that Google

[34:00]
interesting about this is that Google
let's say they would quote it right and
then they'd send you to the website now
what they've do is they craw the web and
then also based on all that data and
information that you've put up there
that made you trustworthy they've said
oh this is the most trustworthy data
we're going to use this as the basis for
our answer but they're not giving
attribution so they're going to give the
answer but they're not going to site
their Source at least right now right
they're not citing the source and so
you've done all this work and you've
created the content but now you don't
even have the link to you and Google I I
get it we have all this data why
wouldn't we just give them the answer as
opposed to sending them off platform to
these other websites like it yeah that's
the that's like the interesting shift to
me so I think one of two things are
going to
happen I'm going to call it the Walmart
option okay and the option b I can't I I
didn't prepare I can't think of an
option b I can't think of a good name
for it Walmart option right Walmart
starts expanding Across America and all
these mom and popop stores go out of

[35:00]
these mom and popop stores go out of
business oh what do we do what do we do
Walmart crushes everyone that's what you
do they go out of business period and
then eventually the pendulum swings a
little bit it's like support small
business but honestly Walmart has never
been better they're great right yeah
yeah and so I could see that happening
where it's like the big guy just wins
again the trillion dollar company just
wins and all these little you know the
equivalent of a shoe shining shop AKA
all these random sites they just don't
get traffic anymore and they're done
they're toast and Walmart might link to
them as like a pad on the back in like
the footnote but who's going to click
that no right and so that's one option
the other option is massive Carnage and
people not wanting multi-trillion dollar
companies to win in uh class action
lawsuits to to protect the little guy
right with the WordPress block but how
is that sustainable like how are we
going to like how are we just going to
put our hands up to AI advancing and
stop them that yeah I think it is going
to get litigated because of the

[36:00]
to get litigated because of the
attribution piece obviously we don't
think of these small businesses as
content creators but the content is
proprietary of those businesses and I
think what they're going to say is like
look you built this model you used our
proprietary data to build the model and
now you're not compensating us for the
model that you built so I think it's
going to be decided in the courts but to
your point there could be a ruling on
that in 5 years there's a between now
and 5 years is a lot of time there's a
lot of businesses that can go out of
business and so what Google gets slapped
on the hand and 5 years from now and
says oops sorry yeah we'll put
attribution but again okay there'll be a
link there they're still they're still
winning there's so it's not only the
small businesses like I'm curious about
digital agencies that do the SEO stuff
does this make them obsolete do they
have to Pivot there has to be a business
opportunity in this like anytime there's
a big disruption there's also a big
business opportunity I don't know what
it is yet I just haven't thought about
it a ton this is tangent but did you see
the business that Kamal sent us to look

[37:00]
the business that Kamal sent us to look
at to potentially buy so for the for
anyone listening we're looking for
businesses to buy right now and so Kamal
our awesome Chief of Staff has been
sending businesses our way he sent a
uiux agency which is I did see that user
interface uh user experience agency I'm
just going to read this real quick I
have it pulled up I was floored at the
numbers of this they're asking 5.5
million their net profit is 1.8 a year
okay so we're talking a 3X multiple on a
digital agency that's growing that has
seven figure eida and it's been around
for six years with 17 employees and I
was thinking about this my first gut
reaction was oh this is oh this is
interesting we could do something with
this right and my second reaction is
dude if I own this business I'm probably
going to be selling this right now too
so why would I buy this business like of
all the things that AI is disrupting
it's disrupting UI and X like already
we're already there mhm it probably

[38:00]
we're already there mhm it probably
isn't even showing in their numbers yet
right they're probably still growing and
they'll be growing in three months but I
bet you anything the owners are smart
enough to know that their days are
numbered yeah I remember this business
now he sent this I didn't do a ton of
research on it was this week right yep
um I would just want to know from the
owner like why are they selling if
there's a compelling reason that the
owner is selling at this price point
right like maybe oh my wife's sick or we
need the M like some there's a reason
for it I could be interested but I tend
to feel like you although I don't I also
don't want to make a decision without
knowing all of the data oh sure yeah so
no no no just like hear me out six
months ago you're looking at Google and
you're like man AI is going to freaking
eat their lunch they screwed up the they
screwed up the roll out of Gemini first
they call it Bard then they call it
Gemini then they roll out Gemini and
it's like showing George Washington is a
black guy and there's a big outcry and
then they just miss wave after he was he
was black and Hamilton though so there's
something to that so I just want to be

[39:01]
something to that so I just want to be
respectful that's on me that's on me
okay anyways like they've botched every
roll out related to AI up until this
point and then all of a sudden they they
release this and you do like the second
and third order effects of this and you
start thinking they're going to make
more money now from businesses paying
them to be ranked M because it's no
longer through SEO oh they're going to
make more money now because people are
going to be on their page longer this is
actually a boon for them so but you
weren't thinking that 6 months ago now
you're thinking oh crap they're going to
be much better placed and that's an
example of the facts just hadn't we just
hadn't been able to evaluate all the
facts yet so for a business like this
that Kamal sent us I think there's a lot
of fear from those agency owners that
are like I got to get out because it's
totally going to ruin and disrupt the
business but they're also could be a
counter argument to say we just don't
know yet maybe they're able to Pivot
maybe this is ultra beneficial to them
and we don't know we we haven't dug into
the numbers but it's just changing so

[40:02]
the numbers but it's just changing so
fast I think SEO is about to have its
biggest change ever but that it's not
going away I think SEO is no longer
going to mean how you rank but it's
going to mean did Google choose your
content to put in the summary vers
someone else's yeah it's freaky to think
about we have businesses that rely on
SEO and are we going to be chosen are we
going to be the the lucky one chosen as
tribute to be in that summary or not
right or
like we we have another stealth project
right now that we're hoping to be
reliant on SEO and now we're not
investing a ton of money into that but
what's that going to look like in a year
so I have that argument right which is
what we're talking about and then the
other side is like my self-driving car
analogy it's like the last 5% takes as
long as the first
95% we could be year years away from
seeing any ramifications from this
because it's so hard to dial in that
last bit of data well I do think that
there are two it and this is like off
the fly so this isn't very well thought

[41:00]
the fly so this isn't very well thought
out but I think that there's two
different search results that we're
talking about there's a knowledge result
like I have a question hey Google what's
the best recipe for pizza right and then
there is a like a Services related
question which is I need my roof
fixed where can I find this in my
area I don't see how it disrupts
the services related searches as much CU
I think that you need it locally you're
searching for something locally I I
don't see how that is necessarily
hurting you locally I see it more on
this side where it's like in the past
you would say what's the best pizza
recipes and then all of a sudden you get
led to Laura's Pizza blog free links
down because it had the most content and
then you click into that and you're like
oh I really like her and it turns out
she sells a course or she sells a
cookbook or she sells like she's relying
on
those searches in order to fund other

[42:01]
those searches in order to fund other
services that she's that she's that
she's selling that are incidental to it
that aren't really the primary driver so
I I do think it's bifurcated between the
two but I think it's Al also only a
matter of time before this one gets
disrupted as well right because aren't
there that's better than me aren't there
a lot of businesses that function that
way where it's like somebody just asks a
question they start reading on their
site they get down a couple things and
all of a sudden they're purchasing
something separate than what they
originally Googled but it's because site
showed up on that original Google and
that's how they drive
traffic is that a fair way to look at it
or am I like way off yeah I I think it
is and I think we could also see a boon
to companies like Duck ducko where they
could they could Zig where where
Google's zagging and they could be like
hey if you like getting 10 search
results when you search for something
that's us that's always us that's going
to be us right that' be interesting they
could just take a hard stance on search
needs to stay as it is
Google could also do this Google Google

[43:00]
Google could also do this Google Google
could also
say that could be a service hey pay me
$5 a month and I'll answer your
questions or I'll just give you what you
traditionally know is Google and how
many people would say like no I like
this because right now it's like beta
testing almost right at some point if
they offered a pay wall to it like I
would look at that and be like no I'd
rather just get the question answered
than have to go through all the links
it's like on on google.com it you could
hit search you can hit show me or get
lucky where it'll just take you to the
first result instead it could just be
like give me 10 search results versus
give me the AI
answer people could choose and it's like
an a it's like a living AB test and
they're going to see over time what
people
prefer this does definitely make me
nervous about the digital services
companies particular the SEO even the
pay-per-click stuff because you just
don't know but the flip side
is they're going to figure it out first
right people who are in that space are
going to figure out where the Arbitrage
is to find those opportunities it's just

[44:01]
is to find those opportunities it's just
when we're talking about a business that
does a 1.8 a year and it's a $5 million
purchase price do you want to take that
big of a swing it's three years until we
pay back the note but I I don't know
that would be that feels like a risky
strategy think of a UI agency a user
interface agency let's say how far away
is AI from this right now where you say
hey make me a website okay lots of sites
can already do that boom webs okay I
want it to look like this website okay
done all right now I need the function
on the back end to look more like this
done that's UI and ux what how far away
from are we from that right
now I feel like we're really close did
you see this the demo with chat GPT
4 like the way that their yeah the
multimodal stuff is is nuts they have a
kid who's like trying to work on
Geometry and she's looking at the
picture and telling him well okay which

[45:00]
picture and telling him well okay which
one's the hypotenuse and he guesses the
wrong one and then it walks him through
why that wasn't the right
answer wish I was high on pot news there
it is I knew you were thinking that the
second I saw you saw my smile key and
peel it's a key and peel re it's great
sketch
