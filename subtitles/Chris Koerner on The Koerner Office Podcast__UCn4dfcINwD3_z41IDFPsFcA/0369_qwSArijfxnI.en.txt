[00:00]
is there a model where you could find
some beautiful venue that's not being
used as a wedding venue and manage all
the business side of it I know of a
party bus company near us they started
literally like a year and a half ago and
they have 30 buses now and they'll do
like 30 vents a night we booked almost
100 weddings before we were done with
construction it was almost like we in a
grand and deposits before we were like
open what told you that there was so
much demand what would you ccel someone
to do if they were wanting to dip toes
into
[Music]
this well why don't you tell us who you
are and what you do Alex so my name is
Alex Nelson I I am the wedding venue guy
on Twitter which is probably most people
know me coming from your followers yeah
I am I'm in based in Iowa so my wife and
I we decided to build a wedding venue
when we were like 25 or we had had the
idea you know when we were getting
married a lot of people do you know they
see the the dollar signs and the amounts
these venues are charging and it's kind
of easy to do you know the the back back

[01:02]
of easy to do you know the the back back
of the napkin math uh and kind of look
at the dates and how many dates they're
booking up and and see their revenue um
sort of thing which is definitely
something that we did too I also always
wanted to kind of get in real estate so
uh we kind of felt like it was like Best
of Both Worlds my wife would kind of be
on the the wedding side and this would
get me into like a big real estate play
essentially so we were getting married
we got married in 2018 fast forward more
to like 2020 and we were like just fresh
out of college so we didn't have money
then to necessarily do it and then mid
Co you know we were thinking of what to
do my wife was teaching at the time and
really just not liking the teaching
world and kind of like all the craziness
that was going with that and she was
very dedicated I was doing like multiple
remote jobs basically so I had like two
two full-time jobs and was going uh at
once and she was still like working more
than I was uh just because she would
like go in early or stay late get ready
for the next day so I was just like what
are we doing here like why why sort of
thing and so she was talking about
becoming like a wedding planner and kind

[02:01]
becoming like a wedding planner and kind
of getting into that world and then we
kind of just went back on the idea of of
the venue and since I was doing multiple
jobs we like we were still living like
we were in college and saving as much
cash as possible I thought I was going
to buy some sort of investment property
but kind of went back to that idea and
we were I think we were like 25 26 when
we really started to kind of like dive
in to it the whole process took us about
two years probably year and a two years
probably from like actually getting into
it and like putting some sort of money
towards it to like actually being open
and having our first events can I ask
like what did you first see in the
wedding venue space that really made you
fall in love with it where you just
couldn't get it out of your head so
definitely was like being the client
first you know so going in our local
market touring the you know five to six
like venues you know there's there's
lots of venues or places to get married
but like when I think or talk about
venues it's like these Standalone like
purpose-built buildings basically like
just for weddings now so there's only

[03:01]
just for weddings now so there's only
like so many in our area and then like
just seeing those being booked out a
year and a half two years in advance is
just like what is going on like I had no
idea I didn't care about weddings at all
before you know starting to plan our own
and so I was just like this big
beautiful building like booking for you
know6 $7,000 a night you know and when I
was thinking about like rentals and
stuff I was just like this is like way
more per night like this seems like way
better right you know I later found out
that it's like a full-on true like
operating business and not just like a
real estate like rental play but that
was definitely like what what stuck in
my mind yeah here's kind of a random
question that I'd never thought of
before let's say someone wants a a
wedding venue and they don't want to go
spend a million dollars on a building
and and convert it or whatever is there
a world or is there a model where you
could find some beautiful venue that's
not being used as a as a wedding venue
and kind of like manage all the business
side of it and just say hey I'm going to
give you two grand every time we host a
wedding there and then you just manage

[04:01]
wedding there and then you just manage
all the business stuff because a lot a
lot of the owners of these beautiful
properties probably don't want to own a
wedding business right is that a thing I
don't know if it's a thing but I it
wouldn't surprise me I think you know
the trend especially like covid and
things like that is like there there is
like a lot more like micro weddings or
smaller weddings you know you don't
necessarily have to have three four 500
people there so then that creates an
opportunity for smaller venues or more
unique venues and then you know the more
unique is the more Instagram gram worthy
and kind of like going towards these
like it's almost just like you know
we're talking about like Isaac French
and like going to like those micro
destination Resort type properties
you're almost doing like you could do
that with like venues also instead of
like these huge massive like name brand
hotels you know you're go into these
micro Resorts basically I don't know if
that's answering your question but
there's definitely like opportunity
there where like 50 75 person weddings
and they almost generate just as much
you know or if they're super highend or

[05:01]
you know or if they're super highend or
or things like that or I I think what
you're maybe saying too is just like
leasing space from like a builder bigger
building or space that's not getting
used I do think there's opportunity
there but you probably would have to
like put some sort of capital into it to
make it like fit the wedding space ready
yeah you know I think the the Trap
people fall into is like they have a
building it could hold 300 people but
that doesn't necessarily mean you can go
get you know 5 to 10 15 grand a night
for it you know the venues that are
getting that or even more depending on
your Market is because they have a
bridal Suite have a groom Suite they can
have space for them to get married on
site inside or outside you know and then
have the reception that holds the 300
people feel like people get really
fixated on like just being able to like
sit or hold 300 people so you have to
like think through like the entire day
like that they're getting that because
or we get that because people run our
space from 8: am. until midnight uh you
know they get ready there they their

[06:00]
know they get ready there they their
makeup and hair and makeup start like at
right away at 8 and then you know their
whole family and all this stuff so
definitely got to like think through all
that but yeah I mean if you could find a
space and like you know from like this
like real estate owner that has no idea
about the wedding worlds and just you
know do some sort of like rev share or
like profit share or something on every
wedding that you booked could definitely
be an easy way to get in yeah okay so
how did you go from this dream you've
done some research to actually getting
the money did you raise the money did
you save the money and how long did it
take you to go from from that to your
open mostly all of our money we we saved
it you know like I said I was working
like two full-time jobs we live in Iowa
you know living cheap living like we're
still out of college uh for those first
few years so I was always big on like
personal finances had like huge
spreadsheet with like our entire budget
and like how much money we had coming in
like I could project out or thought I
could project out exactly like what we'd
be able to save basically so I knew like

[07:00]
be able to save basically so I knew like
once I could like get up to like the
100K range like cash I could probably
like make something happen originally
you know I thought I could build
something for
1.5 you know and then I started learning
by SBA Loans and I was like all like 10%
down you know get to like 150 somehow
and we'll figure it out so yeah that's
basically what we did and then I you
know I learned you know in the SBA loan
like the money you put towards like you
know if you paid for like consulting or
paid start paying for rendering or like
like all your design plans and things
like that that like what you spend on
that can be counted toward like your
Equity towards your towards your down
payment
essentially roll it in roll it in so you
know that's that like looking back it
was definitely like risky but I was just
like we'll figure it out so like we paid
you know five grand for like Consulting
up front to someone that owned like a
venue and was kind of like doing like
helping with design and things like that
and our parents were definitely like we
were talking to them about this and like
that and we kind of like argued on like

[08:02]
that and we kind of like argued on like
just that starting point too like that
you know they felt like it wasn't
necessary but I was also like I knew
like we had to spend money to start then
it like became real basically it like
forced us to like not just talk about it
and and actually do something about it
so yeah we didn't I I would say like at
no point did I we have like 200 300
Grand saved up which is like ultimately
what we ended up putting towards uh the
the building um like just sitting there
cash like we we got close and we started
spending money and like slowly inching
our way towards it you know um it was
like covid or 2020 2021 time frame so
like we were working with a builder and
we'd have like pricing at you know one
pricing at like you know 1.5 and then it
would take us a few months longer and
then all of a sudden go back and it's
2.1 now right to like you know another
season down so that happened to us like
three four times but ultimately then our
our parent both of our parents did end
up giving giving us 40,000 each so

[09:00]
up giving giving us 40,000 each so
80,000 total and then we came up with
their difference that was never like the
plan we're not from like super wealthy
areas you know like my parents live in a
small town called wolfer Iowa like I I
promise we're not like rolling it and
that was like they just like that only
happened because like we like already
had the plans in place we literally had
people like begging to book the venue
like it was at that point it's like a
flam dunk okay so there was demand
already in place definitely we basically
ended up getting renderings done and and
booked almost 100 weddings before being
done with construction whoa yeah that so
that's like a whole another story too of
like what's it's that half a million
dollars we were taking like 50% down our
Saturdays were like 6,500 Fridays like
5500 so it was almost like 300 Grand in
deposits before we were like open
essentially but
crazy yeah were they booking off of
rendering yes yeah I'd say about half of
those were St like renderings like we

[10:01]
those were St like renderings like we
had maybe started like dirt work and
they could go drive by like the site and
things our whole project did end up
getting delayed a bit too so that was
like a whole another whole another
problem and eventually then we did start
doing like construction tours but for
the most part like renderings we had
like a rending walk through and then
like instead of doing a tour like my
wife and I would either meet these
couples at a coffee shop nearby or we
would or we would do like a zoom call
with them where did all these bookings
come come from how did you find these
hundred yeah people mostly just Facebook
Instagram we did like pay to be on like
the knot in the wedding wire we still do
I know you're your one post about the
the not in the wedding wire fully agree
I pretty confident there's fake leads
being pushed on that site but we do
still get some some from there still
worth it yeah we're locked in at I think
we pay like six grand a year so like one
wedding from them basically pays for it
you know some other people are paying
like 20 grand like their pricing is like

[11:00]
like 20 grand like their pricing is like
all over the place right and like I'm
surprised they've never tried to raise
it on us but they never have probably
just because they don't even know but
they're afraid proudly it's funny
because after I tweeted for anyone that
didn't see it I just tweeted hate about
the not.com and how people were
insinuating that they feed fake leads
through Bots which other companies like
Ashley Madison has have done right
because they're incentivized to give you
leads because that's how they charge and
it went viral like it went viral on
short form video and on Twitter and like
the next day the account manager that I
had booked with and she had already
booked a follow-up call with me she just
quietly canceled the followup call she
never emailed never said anything she's
like okay all right I was very careful
to not mention her you like I didn't
want to bring her into it that is
hilarious yeah all right so when you say
Facebook and Instagram were you just
like posting organically were were you
building in public like status updates
did you get a bunch of followers what
that look not building public I didn't
really start doing that maybe until like

[12:00]
really start doing that maybe until like
Twitter when I got in there later but
yeah mostly just posting like our like
we just made a a Facebook page you know
and and started posting the renderings
and made an Instagram page start we
maybe rant some ads here and there but
nothing nothing crazy we still really
don't yeah pretty much just all organic
um it really just goes back to like
there was like such a need in our area
and a demand for like another vent you
know when you say you're going to open
up in 2023 and you know every other
venue around you is already booked for
2023 and there's plenty of people that
don't want to have to wait two years to
get married you know there's there's
quite a few leads come in from that so
so what told you that there was so much
demand how much research did you do
versus just anecdotally talking to
people having a wedding there yourself
you knew mostly like looking back like
it we thought we really really 100% knew
but it was probably more just a gut
feeling and like we were the clients
first I would say like we were you know

[13:00]
first I would say like we were you know
we went to like fresh out of college
like we got married like all so like at
this time when we're trying to build
like is the time we're going to weddings
for like all of our friends all like all
of our cousins all of our you know
everyone like our age so like we you
know we were the clients essentially or
yeah we're like the same clientele
basically so and also like we we were
doing something different too like right
we built a a modern like all black
building when like everywhere around us
here in Iowa is farmhouses and I feel
like The Farmhouse trend it's like
people are like not everyone in Iowa
lives on you know a farm and and wants
to get married like with cornfields in
the back sort of thing they not
everyone's you know super hillbilly like
like some might think but so there was a
need for something different design wise
so I played into it as well thank thank
you chip and Joanna for Paving way
definitely so I'm looking at Google maps
called the midnight gem it's in swisser
Iowa yeah swisser Titan clay like SOA
rapid is like the next plot of like

[14:00]
rapid is like the next plot of like
Rapids so we're basically right between
C Rapids Iowa City which are decent Siz
cities yeah so on one hand it's like wow
you're in the middle of nowhere you're
off a highway but you know who thinks to
have a wedding when you out off a
highway so let's scratch that but on the
other hand like I love I'm a total
location nerd retail nerd like I love
traffic patterns and all that I I like
following the barbell strategy right you
might not invest in Cedar Rapids you
might not invest in Iowa City those are
kind of sat ated but between those two
cities it's still affordable and all the
growth is heading that way so is that
kind of what you were thinking yeah yep
yeah if you really want to like dive in
like location like you go Iowa City
there's like a bunch of towns like North
Liberty Corville tiffen those pretty
much all merged into like one big city
right like same things happening like
Cedar rabbits Mar and highwa those kind
of things and like basically the growth
is like the same like what you're saying
like Cedar RTI City are basically
merging also and that goes through
swisser which is right up in the middle

[15:00]
swisser which is right up in the middle
okay so how much Allin to launch and
then how much time did it take yeah
Allin about 2.9 that's land Building
Furniture fixtures equipment everything
and then I think we would have got the
land under contract December 2020 and we
officially open October 2022 so okay
about two years yeah almost almost two
years okay and then were you able to use
some of the deposits to help pay for the
loan or the note or did you have to keep
that separate that wasn't like the
intention but yeah
weit real cash in our bank account that
we have you know and then you we like
had like building costs we basically
could end up you know anything over
which we did end up going over like we
could just front it with the cash that
we had okay was there a point during
this process where you went from like
really worried if this is going to work
to just like really excited because you

[16:00]
to just like really excited because you
knew it was going to work what did that
look or feel like lots and lots of ups
and downs you know at the beginning
you're nervous kind of get into it it's
like okay this is going to work like
let's we're really going to do it like
this gonna be life changing blah blah
and then when you're in the thick of it
and like we were like facing
construction delays and like constant
like price raises where like you know we
we might fold you know and then we
started taking deposits in and it's like
okay we have to make this work otherwise
like we are literally screwed so sort of
thing so yeah I think once we finally
got past the like are we even going to
like finish the building like we kind of
like could be like believe finish the
building and then finish on time also
because like we had weddings booked
right like for October first like we had
to be ready yeah because it's like
you're getting all these bookings which
is a great proof of concept product
Market fit whatever you want to call it
but the fact that you don't have a
building yet almost heightens the
anxiety level right right yeah it's just
like Stakes yeah you know 21 2020 year

[17:02]
like Stakes yeah you know 21 2020 year
old me would say like oh if you have
like 300 Grand in the bank account like
all would be fine like it doesn't matter
like you could deal with any problem in
the world it doesn't matter but no like
you still feel that anxiety and that
pressure and like eventually like those
numbers just don't mean anything you
know you still have to perform so okay
so I'm looking at your Venue on Google
Earth and when I think of like a a more
rural eish like chip and Joanna type
wedding venue I think like some sort of
a natural beauty right Big Trees water
feature something Iowa's cornfield and
it looks like from what I see on Google
Earth there's a bunch of cornfields
around you how did you approach that did
you did that concern you or did you
think like the beauty of our building is
what is we're going to lean on and not
necessarily you know 100y old oak trees
yeah it's definitely was like a hard
hard decision kind of to make what let
us to like our location like where we
are it does kind of feel like we're in
the middle of nowhere but like if you
knew the area like compared to other
venues we actually not like we all ride

[18:02]
venues we actually not like we all ride
off like a major like Interstate
actually and ride off a highway also so
like 380 is like a bit like the big
Interstate near us that goes through R
City so like in that sense like we're
like really close to things like the
airport is actually like 5 minutes away
from us just that way and there's like
four hotels right there that are less
than four minutes away so that play like
a big part of like we're near the
airport we're near hotels easy access
off the interstate versus like all the
other like venues are like Farm like
Barn ven so like they're on like 10
acres you know like Alpha Gravel Road
sort of thing that's like typical Iowa
and what you might think of so we're
actually not which then we felt like
played into like what we were doing with
like the modern building is like we
don't need to be on like a 100 Acre Farm
to like get that beauty sort of thing
and as far as like the the live oak
trees like we just don't have those
around here so it's like that that was
never going to be a thing you know it is
mostly cornfield you know we we did the
building then you could look at pictures
like we have like a putting green like
out there we built like a little like
waterfall like next to that so that sort

[19:02]
waterfall like next to that so that sort
of the thing but like Yeah we're
definitely leaning on like we were like
the new modern like cool looking
building and like our our venue was like
we're like based around like the
building basically versus like the the
scenery or being out in the middle of
nowhere sort of thing all right if you
are watching this clip right now you are
watching this on YouTube and if you are
a fan of podcast please check out my
podcast while you're at it because
sometimes I have podcasts that aren't on

that aren't on podcasts so check out the
ker office on any podcast platform or
you can go to TKO pod.com also my
newsletter will throw that in there
there are no ads It's weekly it's
different content than my podcast and
YouTube newsletter. chrisj cerner.com
You'll see the link and we'll see you
there okay all right so you open late
2022 what did your what did your first
years of revenue and profit look like
until now yep so 2022 top of my head I
we only had I think we had like 14
weddings that year so 150ish maybe
Revenue wise but first full year was
last year so 2023
um we did uh about 8,780 I believe and

[20:03]
um we did uh about 8,780 I believe and
then so if you look at that like like
noi basically um so not including debt
was like 330 I believe and then this
year we should do more like 850 or so
pushing nine hopefully mostly how these
last few months wrap up barwise mostly
the big variant but similar numbers we
put a lot back into the building and and
hired more team staff and next year I
feel like it should even out a little
bit more so should have a higher noi but
or profit e whatever metric you want to
go off of but so are you looking at like
not including your your loan like 40%
net margins correct okay that's amazing
and you look at this more of like a real
estate play or a business play because
you say noi I think real estate you say
eida I think business I guess I've went
back and forth a lot it really depends
on who you're asking I will say the more
and more we get into it it is more of
like a business play and just like a

[21:00]
like a business play and just like a
real estate play like there's like a
fullon like operating business in that
building essentially okay so here's kind
of a random question I we dm'd about
this a while ago but I asked this both
selfishly and for anyone listening
because this could apply more to them I
I live in this house we built it eight
years ago it's our dream house but we're
probably going to move at some point
we're going to build another one we
thought about having this as a wedding
venue and we never would have thought
that before until we were forced to move
to Houston for my daughter's health
issues we put this house on Airbnb and
about half of the people that rented it
rented it for a wedding and they got a
steal of a deal because it was like 800
a night right so that's a pretty cheap
wedding and it's it's in an area where
it would make sense for that we're 30
minutes from downtown Dallas we're on a
few Acres there's parking there's big
ceilings is there is there a model where
someone could buy a house in an area
that would allow for zoning or no zoning
in a more rural area and convert it into
a wedding venue like this because if you

[22:00]
a wedding venue like this because if you
go pric out a wedding venue it's going
to be priced like a business right with
a multiple but if you go buy a house
it's going to be priced like a house is
there anything there oh yeah definitely
definitely I think the the biggest
hurdles would be like zoning and then
like if your county or city does allow
it then it's like parking issues
probably because to really get up there
on like the rental you probably need to
be like holding more than like a 100
people right to like and then then just
goes like Logistics right so like a nice
beautiful Full House like you have the
area you know in somewhere like Houston
or Texas like the weather is generally
nice so like you're good there other
areas like Iowa not so much like if they
have to be like inside or weather's
unpredictable sort of thing but then
there there it still wouldn't be there
definitely would still be like a real
business aspect to it right like you'd
have to get like the tents lined up or
do the like unless you're doing a lot of
the things for them the rental fee that
you can charge is probably not going to
be that high like so you rented it for
8800 but they probably brought in what
their own tents and Caterers and um

[23:02]
their own tents and Caterers and um
alcohol and if they had get some sort of
alcohol license for that or not or maybe
they just did it you know to like all
these things like we have like all the
table and then they're on like tables
and chairs and things like that but if
you had this house you turn it into a
wedding venue and you could have some
sort of structure like that like a
permanent tent or if the house is big
enough to actually hold 100 plus people
on like one room sort of a ballroom that
can make sense there's just like so many
like different ways to go about it so
definitely yes you just have to get a
little creative I think okay interesting
yeah it's just something that we've kind
of talked about these last couple years
all right so let's talk about other
opportunities in the wedding space like
wedding wedding rentals you know I
posted about wedding arch rentals luxury
bathroom rentals do you see opportunity
in that space from someone in the
industry oh yeah tons tons because like
things are like always changing too
right it's all about like Instagram and
like new things so even if there's like
a you know you you didn't want to be
like a full-on like rental company you

[24:00]
like a full-on like rental company you
could just have a couple pieces that are
trendy like the Arches like you're
saying like the right ones and rent it
for 100 bucks pop chop it off pick it up
sort of thing you know we talked about
like the portable
bathrooms you seen the beer burrow the
beer donys yeah the beer dys yeah those
are sweet sweet you more and more like
coffee trucks or coffee carts are like
becoming a thing at weddings food trucks
started becoming really popular as like
l night snack and then they turned into
like people are just using them as like
their fullon caterer there's like a
million things like that there's all
like the the different kind of like
photo booths or like the 360 spins or
like you know all all these things you
know that you'll see like even like
wedding planners like adding as like
another service onto their business or
like a rental that they could do or the
DJs add on like all the tech stuff too
that they can rent out or just like
wedding decor rental places the the the
opportunities are pretty much endless
and you know I think obviously Like Home

[25:00]
and you know I think obviously Like Home
Service businesses are super super um
popular on Twitter or just like service
business in general because you can like
start for low startup cost just like
doing the work yourself it's essentially
like the same becoming like any sort of
like wedding vendor whether uh there's
maybe a little bit more like skill to it
like to be a photographer you have to be
good but like all you really need is
camera and then it's just like you
taking the pictures editing it yourself
you know videography yeah the the
rentals you know the labor going there
and you know taking it there and set it
up and you could start with like one
piece and then add to your collection
from there um so there there there's
lots of different things have you ever
had like a conversation with a vendor
that just opened your eyes to how busy
they were like have you ever seen any
supply and demand imbalances in the
space that people could capitalize on
yeah like the main like Caterers things
like it is like crazy to think you know
like we are a venue and we're pretty
popular and we'll do like 70 to weddings
a year and then to think of some of

[26:00]
a year and then to think of some of
these vendors doing Four Weddings a
night I know of a party bus company near
us that has like they started literally
like a year and a half ago and they have
like 30 buses now and they'll do like 30
vents a night like that that's insane
like what and weddings are just like a
piece of that business yeah yeah so then
you then you get into like just the
whole events kind of space and honestly
that's a lot of the vendors too are like
we're pretty tied to like straight
weddings because that's going to be like
the biggest bang for a buck and usually
like if you're in the event space too
like weddings are going to be like
you're Big Money Maker but like um you
know depending on what you're doing
there's not there's no saying you can't
do a wedding plus you're renting out
stuff for a different sort of event that
night or corporate whatever it is so
anything that you're not tied to just
like one location and you could be doing
like multiple events all at one night
there's a lot of logistics to figure
that out and it can be kind of chaos but
like there's no saying you know you
can't do 10 weddings in one night like

[27:00]
can't do 10 weddings in one night like
there all the venues around us you know
are pretty much booked every Friday
Saturday so if you have some sort of
service where you can be at multiple of
those venues at once you can grow Beyond
like what we ever could we're pretty
limited with only so many dates and only
space for so many things but yeah I'm
just this idea is coming ahead as you're
talking where remember we had that tweet
about the the candelight concerts right
you hosted one of those and then I
posted on Instagram about a month ago
about Bingo Loco have you heard of that
I saw you I saw your post on that too
yeah it was it's just like expensive
Bingo for Millennials with alcohol and
food and do you think there's a world
where someone could have a venue like
yours and it's like wedding first but
it's really it's just a place for
Millennials to go spend too much money
to do to experience things like candle
light concerts in Bingo Loco and really
you could in-house all of them right
like it could just be one company you're
not Outsourcing it to the Candlelite
concerts of the world you're just
copying them and having your own like
Friday and Saturday events yeah yeah I I

[28:01]
Friday and Saturday events yeah yeah I I
I'm in Iowa and think like we've thought
about this too and we've done some of
our own events and they go okay but I
always felt like if you're in a bigger
market like you could crush like your
own events and like make more than and
less work than a wedding would be too
right like we had like someone doing
like a murder mystery at our at our
space and then they're just like renting
it from us for it same thing with like
the candle light and then they're
selling tickets for it and you know 200
tickets at 60 bucks a pop plus you know
if if they had the venue and got to make
like the alcohol we'll make the alcohol
sales on that but you know you can do 15
20 30 Grand in revenue on off one event
without like that that many you know you
don't need like a stadium full of people
necessarily you just got to like find
these like Niche like events like the
candle lights or the murder like things
that are gonna sell I think the
challenge would be constantly coming up
with the the new Concepts that are going
to keep keep people excited but the
candle light uh concerts are still
happening in our space they just had one
on like the 28th like on a Monday night
so like but they basically around like
Halloween and do it themed and they're

[29:00]
Halloween and do it themed and they're
like still selling pretty well and they
do like two events a night like two
different concerts wow wow you hosted
them again you said yeah so they pretty
much just pay us to like rent the space
so we don't have like much involvement
with like actual like operating of the
event sort of thing but yeah I mean
their their model is pretty crazy right
like they're just like finding these
contract workers they're like they just
like bought and delivered the candles to
our space fake candles fake candles they
pay us like 150 maybe I shouldn't go too
deep in too deep into this I did on that
tweet that went viral I did have there
one of like the main person I was
working with like reach out and said
that the C CEO saw saw our tweet there
and they're like wondering if we're
trying to like sabotage them it's like
no just like no Chris is Chris is was
just part Chris doesn't
care so um but yeah like it's not rocket
SS right and like you can in theory just
copying face I don't think like they

[30:00]
copying face I don't think like they
they've done a great job and they're big
enough to like where they shouldn't
worry about like people copying them I
think that's just the nature of the
business world right but in theory you
could do that that would be like our
plan B right like if if weddings sto
booking like we do still have the space
like we can hold you know hundreds of
events a year and if you can build a
team that's good at hosting events then
there there's there's lots of things you
can do yeah it's funny you know that
Meme of of Don Draper from Mad Men where
he's like pitching something with a
board next to him yeah yeah have you
it's like the candle light concerts when
they launched it was like concerts but
with
candles it's like everyone's like you're
an idiot and it's like no they do they
do really well it's like Bingo but with
strobe lights what well they're they
have 400 events a year you know 30 grand
a night yeah it's just ah it's just
crazy how you can just put a little
tweak on something and just print money
literally both of those They just added
lights yeah yeah seriously
I guess take take common events and add

[31:01]
I guess take take common events and add
cool lights to it and you should be good
but it is a good point with like the the
location because I think the more rural
you are the more you have to be
dependent on a wedding venue which isn't
a bad thing you guys are doing great
you're crushing it and you you also
don't have as expensive of a location as
someone in the DFW suburbs might have if
you are closer to more population then
you can get a lot more creative with
other events how much do you have to
rely on alcohol sales for your business
either top line or bottom line Top Line
you're talking like 40% of our Revenue
at this point H so yeah oh without it we
probably wouldn't be profit I mean we
have to like switch up our whole like
model like we'd probably like be
Staffing less right and like basically
turn into there's a lot of venues where
like you might rent the space get the
tables and chairs they might just unlock
the door for you the morning of and then
they're gone right like you clean up you
do everything yourself you'd probably
have to be like in that model if you're
just doing like straight like rental

[32:00]
just doing like straight like rental
fees with no alcohol sales or no no
added services or anything like that
which isn't a bad thing probably a lot
less stress honestly that would turn it
more into that like real estate play
side of things versus being like a
fullon like operating business but you
know if you want to make more money you
got to do more work essentially yeah
that's a trade-off yeah and you could
probably just have referral Partners
right like yeah we don't do the alcohol
but but these guys do and they give you
Kickbacks yeah yeah and depending like
where you are and like there's there's a
lot of you know states where it's hard
to get a liquor license like I was not
one of them I think we pay like 900
bucks a year so super cheap it might as
well gez but you know a lot of places I
think like California is like crazy and
like they only have like so many
licenses they hand out per year and
people bid on them and crazy things like
that but a lot of the times I think in
certain States like the Caterers will
have to have like a a liquor license and
then basically you just yeah like some
sort of referral fee or partner with one
or two Caterers and then you know you
get 102 % at their top line that they
bring in and you just guarantee them

[33:01]
bring in and you just guarantee them
like all the events at your space so
there's definitely ways around it and
and things like that so go back in time
what would you have done differently
about either the building or the
business knowing what you know now there
I mean there's like things about like
the building itself or like design wise
or or things like that that we would do
differently like we have like all
drywall in the in the grand hall and it
just like gets beat to crap basically
every year so there's like little things
like that that drive us nuts I would
probably try to think of a model where
we could staff probably less somehow
some way just like by not promising so
much or certain things that then
essentially it just takes like a little
bit more the pressure off of us it's
definitely like a high pressure day
right and the more you promise or say
you're going to do for the couples and
the families like the more they expect
and you know the day has to be perfect
there's no there's no going back on
someone's wedding so um we make plenty
of mistakes and we try to learn from

[34:01]
of mistakes and we try to learn from
them but usually what ends up happening
is like we have to offer them money back
you know like yeah this is their wedding
you know and they're very upset like
they'll never get to stay back and like
the only way you can even attempt to
make up for it is like give them sizable
amounts you know $500,000 back
unfortunately so what percentage of the
time would you say you've had to do that
they sting right it hurts and it feels
like it's like all the time but I would
say like probably only like one to
three% of the weddings you know oh wow
it does happen that's pretty good and
I'm sure those conversations are so
stressful very stressful you know every
time we get one of those messages it's
just like yeah it's a day Ruiner not
going to lie but that is that is the
world we're in so well dude that's the
thing about business is you know I've
done so many different businesses and
there's nothing else in this world where
you're like you're one text message away
from a ruined year or ruined life or one
phone call or one email
and it could come at any moment at any
time and it just always looms it always

[35:02]
time and it just always looms it always
lingers and when you work at 9 to-5 like
yeah you could get fired at any point
but really that's the worst thing that
could happen but when you're a business
owner oh man it gets a lot worse than
being fired yeah it sure does and you
can't turn it off at all no are you
seeing anything else in the industry
that's interesting that people might be
able to get some benefit from or take
advantage of you know I think if you
look at industry as a whole it it's you
know the reason like my kind of like
venue exists is like people used to get
married in the church and then they'd
probably go find a hotel Ballroom or
some sort of like event space to do
their reception at but like slowly as
people like less and less people get
married at at their Church you know they
want to get married on site and they
they do they want it all in one location
right like they want to get married have
their cocktail hour and have all this
stuff like all in one all in one place
so then I feel like that's when like the
these staying alone like Barn venues
started popping up and it's like come

[36:00]
started popping up and it's like come
have it here instead and then they just
got more and more complex of like
someone added a bridal Suite now all the
venues pretty much have to have a bridal
Suite otherwise like you're missing like
a huge part of like the day of getting
ready and taking pictures while you're
getting ready and then someone at then
you gotta like match it with the groom
suite and now you need a spot for
cocktail hour now you need a plan B Spot
for the ceremony since want to get
married outside like all these things so
I feel like the buildings like keep
getting more and more complex that
definitely has left like the hotels I
feel like I I I wish I could like find a
stat on like how much like they're
losing out on like wedding Revenue
because i' would imagine it it'd be a
lot it still kind of blows me in some of
the bigger cities like it still is
mostly like hotels that are dominating
the the wedding uh space and I think
it's just too expensive to build these
type of venues you
know super close to downtown areas which
makes sense but I think what could
happen is uh kind of like what we're
talking about
going more towards even more like
destination spots or micro Resorts kind

[37:02]
destination spots or micro Resorts kind
of thing and like that like those kind
of properties really getting into the
Wedding Game just makes it that much
more like Instagram worthy and like
unique and kind of like going that way
but on the flip side I will say like not
everyone wants to have like their
friends and family travel like super far
right like that's that's like our
business is like most people are like
right here in Iowa like within like the
45 minute radius and like they have
their all their family from their whole
lives like here like they're not going
to make them pay um you know three grand
to go you know to their wedding at at
some destination property um but I think
that will continue to Trend and like
micro weddings and things like that will
still continue to grow in more unique
properties so whether that's people
turning their houses into a cool venue
or some sort of like smaller property
where they don't have to spend three
million bucks to build it um will happen
but I think there's there's a world
where both exist is there an advantage
or a premium you could charge for a
venue where the wedding party or at

[38:00]
venue where the wedding party or at
least the couple could sleep there on
site as well yes definitely I guess that
that maybe that's kind of what I'm
picturing with like the the the like the
micro Resort you know so maybe it's like
your Venue plus like 10 cabins sort of
property you know that that's like a
step above like my venue and I wish I
could my my County actually won't let me
do short-term rentals next to us
otherwise I would definitely be doing
that because then there's just so many
more things that you can do if they're
staying on the friends family are
staying on the property then they
probably need a space for like their
rehearsal J the night before so now you
can cash in on that and do that you know
and maybe they'll stay through Sunday
and then you have two wedding there's a
lot more like generate lot more Revenue
you could generate doing that because as
I mentioned you are kind of limited with
the amount of dates that you have and
that's probably the biggest downfall I
would say is like you know we can't go
from pushing one million in Revenue to
like five million all of a sudden or we
can't really scale without building like
another building basically which is
cost money yeah so if you were me with

[39:01]
cost money yeah so if you were me with
with my house we've got five bedrooms
and then each bedroom has its own full
bath plus a half bath so five and a half
baths five bedrooms and then we have
space upstairs for a six bedroom and
like bonus room and game room that we
could build out it's already framed and
everything if you had six bedrooms to
work with six full baths how would you
convert that to be a wedding venue would
you take a couple of the bedrooms and
make it like a groom suite and a bridal
SU and then leave four as like actual
bedrooms for people to stay or what
would that look like in your opinion
yeah uh probably that um I think like
the the bridal suite and the groom Suite
would be like the missing piece in like
just going to like someone's house so
giving them like a dead designated area
or maybe you build you know a shed out
back that can be like the groom Suite
sort of
thing and do that and then but then
maybe not trying to get rid of like the
the sleeping or the beds you know maybe
it's a a groom Suite but there's still
like spots where they can sleep within
there I don't know how big of the
bedrooms are you know but having that

[40:01]
bedrooms are you know but having that
and then I think like the biggest piece
would be like where is the ceremony
happening where's a reception happening
you know so some sort of gazebo or
Pavilion outside for the ceremony that
you can put like nice landscaping around
and then if you have to like get a
permanent tent or tent rentals or
something for the for the reception
outside that I would go that route okay
that's kind of what we're thinking so
well Alex this was great I appreciate
your time I i' love love this space I
think it's it's a lot like the
short-term rental space in that like
it's very instagrammable it's sexy
people fall in love with it it's
romantic in actuality it's very
stressful it's very hard but in
actuality the margins are actually
really good what would you counsel
someone to do if they were wanting to
dip their toes into this either to buy a
venue or to build a venue yeah so I've
looked at buying a lot of other venues
too that that's tough right now just
because the values are all over the
place I I don't think people know how to
Value them you know they put some sort
of like real estate value and then a lot

[41:00]
of like real estate value and then a lot
of these venues have 10 acres 20 acres
and then they're like adding that onto
it and then maybe like some sort of like
business value on top of that but it's
like you know the business can't
generate enough to pay for this $5
million building like doesn't make sense
sort of but so I'd say like buying is
tough a lot of unrealistic sellers now
that can't you can't find one but you
know just make sure it makes sense and
you know if you wanted to start one
definitely you know Zone in on like
where you want to you know do some
market research which is essentially
just looking up you know all the venues
in your area you know a lot of them have
their calendars on their website reach
out to all them act like you're getting
married and get their pricing how booked
out are they dates yeah like how booked
out are they you know are they booking
Friday Saturdays are they only booking
Saturdays you know are they booking
Sundays even too you know what is their
style is there like a Tona Barn venue
still and there's a need for something
different you know like how are you
going to be different uh versus just
like throwing up another building and
and thinking you're going to charge you
know 20 grand a night for it I'd be

[42:00]
know 20 grand a night for it I'd be
careful on like how many weddings you
underrate on that front you know have
have some sort of Plan B you know worst
case scenarios break evens that sort of
thing but there's definitely in a lot of
markets more room for more venues and I
think you know as there might have been
like a little bit of Boom of building
between like 20221 when interest rates
were cheap but I think a lot of them I
think like two more were supposed to go
up around us but they ended up getting
built mostly just the environment so I
think there will be that's good an
opportunity here soon to to get a couple
more in a lot of markets I'm also happy
to help with anyone I've consulted a lot
at this point especially getting started
in the building phase and dealing with
zoning and things like that so DM me on
Twitter there's not a lot of businesses
where the market research is so binary
and straightforward you know you just
get them on the phone how booked are you
okay and that's the question they get
every day so they're not suspicious by
being asked that

[43:00]
being asked that
right venue with acting like you're
getting you know like and see how much
they charge and you can oh you do this
much in Revenue interesting everyone's
full within 30 minutes okay yeah there's
room for me here and back to what you
were saying about Twitter so where can
people find you yep Twitter mostly so
wedding V guy on Twitter DM me on there
and we can hop on a call chat okay Alex
this is great thank you for your time
awesome thanks Chris appreciate it all
right right what you think please share
it with a friend and we'll see you next
time on the ker office
