[00:00]
I think it's like five or six zip codes
where I do 40% of my business you
literally invented an industry season 1
I thought I was only going to do like 35
houses and I ended up doing nearly 250 I
literally was putting pumpkins in my
Yukon and delivering and designing them
myself this year 134 last year was $850
the year before was $ 750 Heather who's
going to buy $11,000 worth of pumpkins
what does your average customer look
like that's a $10,000 day the number one
question is what what are your margins
[Music]
like okay so first of all I love the
name porch pumpkins it sounds like
something I would name a business
because it's just the domains available
on on one hand it's like how is that
domain available on the other hand It's
like because no one's doing this right
it's like right it's a great name what
inspired the name so what inspired the
name is I have been decorating with
pumpkins for a long time so in 2013 when
um I stayed at home with my oldest son
he was a little 7-month-old and I went

[01:03]
he was a little 7-month-old and I went
crazy with pumpkins and actually that
design if I showed it to you you would
be quite appalled it's a bunch of orange
pumpkins in different sizes and I used
to put them within my landscaping and
what I learned is that if you put
pumpkins in landscaping they will rot
faster than if you put them on a porch
so I knew this because I've had years
and years of decorating in my home my
own home experience so I knew that I
wanted it to be very clear that we would
be putting pumpkins on your porch so
they will last longer and so I I just
knew that porch pumpkins was concise and
it got straight to the point and it
would allow for also a great logo
because I wanted to incorporate my
personal door into my logo of porch
pumpkins oh I like that yeah obviously I
didn't realize that I've never seen your
door but yeah you also have the
alliteration two PS it's three syllables
easy to spell nothing weird perfect name
respect a good name thank you thank you

[02:02]
respect a good name thank you thank you
yeah so this all started with one
Instagram post just kind of offhand you
did your own someone loved it you did it
for them then you're like H maybe
there's something here let's see what
the universe gives me right yes and no
so it I had people in my when I was in
Dallas when I would do my own home they
always wanted me to do pumpkins for them
but I was I still had young children at
that time and I was not looking to take
on anything more than decorating for my
family the yes part is I knew that once
when we moved to rock wall Heath I was
my my youngest was going off to school
two or three days a week and I was
really wanting to start doing something
for myself again and I've always been
like an entrepreneur at heart my husband
and I both are and so I realized like
people have always asked me to do this
and I started getting Christmas light
quotes for Rockall Heath and I realized

[03:00]
quotes for Rockall Heath and I realized
wait my friends are paying this much for
Christmas light
installations okay because in Dallas we
had a more narrow house and my Christmas
lights were $400 I was getting quotes
out here for $1,500 $2,000 for that
first year of installation and so it all
just like the XYZ lined up and I
realized like you know that's a great
price point for someone else Christmas
lights I mean I'm not going to pay that
but yeah I it's
made my it made my wheel spin that if
someone's paying this for one holiday
I've always loved decorating my own home
with pumpkins and that actually takes
care of two holidays both Halloween and
Thanksgiving and that's when I worked on
creating the packages and so with my one
post which you hinted at there my one
post I did posted it on Instagram and I
started sharing it with my friends
saying like this is the business I'm
going to do if this is something you're
interested in please let me know when I

[04:00]
interested in please let me know when I
started I didn't have any photos except
for the photos of my own home so I
offered my friends you know 50% off so I
could get some photos of porches for my
Instagram and then later website of
course and then I asked them if they
thought it was a great idea or was
something that they thought a friend
would enjoy if they would just share it
with them and so I literally started in
like old school ways social sharing
because I was texting it to my friends
and I was offering this but then also
Instagram and so it did land into a few
fun fun hands that shared on their
Instagram platform that at the time you
know there was someone with like 80,000
followers that shared my business and
said this is genius I just bought my
pumpkins you should buy yours and that's
when my phone went from dinging to
people I knew or I knew once REM moved
to complete strangers buying buying
porch pumpkins so okay wow so first of
all people don't realize how big
Halloween is like from a revenue
perspective and how much for whatever
cultural reason it's been growing over
the last decade or two I have this bies

[05:02]
the last decade or two I have this bies
business where we resell bues products
and August 3rd they drop all of their
Halloween stuff and our sales go crazy
and we just go nuts from August 3rd to
early November all because of Halloween
and it's not that much smaller than
Christmas for us and I've read articles
about other big box retailers really
raking it in from Halloween and most
people don't realize that they think
it's Christmas and then everything else
but Halloween is on it's huge it's huge
I mean even if you walk into Lowe's
right now like they are putting up
Christmas decor but they're Halloween
and like blow up things and mummies and
all of those things that section is just
as large as Christmas right now because
they realize there's a market for it I
personally think it's like two different
reasons one like almost everyone
celebrates like Halloween or fall right
it's not a religious holiday some people
would say it's anti-religious but it's
not a religious holiday where you're
only getting this segment of people that
are celebrating and so it really opens

[06:01]
are celebrating and so it really opens
it up and then you add that if you have
kids you want to decorate agreed now
when when you first launched did you
take any inspiration from anyone like
other than like seeing other people
decorating their porches on Pinterest
had you ever heard of or seen another
business doing exactly what you were
doing when you launched no I had not
seen anyone else offering like pumpkin
services at their door I lived across
from the Dallas alarum when I started
like playing with pumpkins in my own
yard and I was super inspired by all of
their displays I mean they build houses
out of pumpkins they Trail every walkway
with those big
50b okay so you know do of times yeah it
is stunning and that's where we would
have our play dat we my son and all my
children we went there one day a week at
least because we lived in East Dallas we
had a smaller yard and so that place you
know the kids could run wild and so I
mean I got inspiration from that all the
time and then also they' have this
fabulous display each year which I

[07:01]
fabulous display each year which I
haven't been in a few years now but they
had like a pumpkin Library so they had
different varietals just kind of spread
like stacked up so you could learn the
name of all these which allowed me to
then start adding on to the pumpkins
that I wanted to use in my own display
because they were teaching me something
when I started creating my pumpkin
packages because I knew from another
business I had that I wanted to do
packages and something that you could
select and that I'm going to point you
to so so even if you send me the front
of your home I'm going to Veer you into
one of these which I when I started I
only had four packages I'm going to Veer
you into one of these four packages or
I'll give you two options and you can
pick like what price point you want to
come in at but I knew that I wanted to
do packages and not custom installs
because I used to be a monogrammer so
like this embroidery which I didn't do
this I Outsource these things now but I
used to be a monogrammer and I would
spend so much time creating all these
different custom designs for the client
to choose and so that is take like that

[08:03]
to choose and so that is take like that
makes my monogram that dollar amount go
down and so that's the same thing like
my working dollar you know yeah so I
knew that I wanted to offer packages and
not do custom which I do offer custom if
someone wants to do something different
we absolutely can do that just yesterday
in Houston I did no orange pumpkins and
we substituted all white pumpkins so it
was just a different muted Vibe and it
was beautiful but so we can do things
like that that make your home feel more
custom but I knew that I wanted packages
so I would be more efficient with my
time once I started doing porch pumpkins
in 2020 and I was out in University Park
and Preston Hollow I was seeing pumpkins
that were obviously not mine I was
seeing them on porches and so I started
paying attention a little bit more once
I actually started working on the
marketing piece since it kind of blew up
and then I mean I knew that I wanted the
Aesthetics of like all the photos being
on my Instagram and like showing the the
work and then my insta story I wanted

[09:02]
work and then my insta story I wanted
people to know me and like my joyfulness
and how happy I am to bring pumpkins to
everyone and just kind of a little
behind the scenes I knew like once I got
through my SE my first season of porch
pumpkins like it really dawned on me you
know I'm a stay-at-home mom and I get to
do this three weeks out of the year and
I get to make some good money for this
time and if I'm going to grow because I
had still like when season 1 I I only I
thought I was only going to do like 35
houses and I ended up doing nearly 250
so oh my goodness yeah yeah so I mean I
quickly thankfully I had some friends
that like heard about it and they're
like well I can drive a trailer for you
because I literally was putting pumpkins
in my Yukon and delivering and designing
them myself and I was doing um like
three to six houses during the day while
the kids were at school and then because
of my customer service background I just
kept saying yes to people like yes I can
take that order absolutely I can do that
and so then my larger packages I would
have my husband pull the trailer when he

[10:00]
have my husband pull the trailer when he
got off work and so then I could do like
the bigger packages the package ones and
so that second week when I was like okay
I can't keep saying yes to all these
people if I don't have a few more people
working for me and so we added that on
and so you know I had at at the end of
my season one I had five people on the
payroll and then the two volunteers me
and my husband right and so but at the
end of the season like we were just like
brainstorming and I'm like this is just
such a great job like I would have loved
to do this when my kids were young and
they were in Mother's Day out Tuesday
Thursday so I really wanted to make a
business model that would be wonderful
for stay-at-home moms to be able to say
I can do that for three weeks and here's
my availability and that's what my
designers do I say these are the three
weeks we're delivering tell me what
you're available and I make your
schedule and so they tell me like I have
some high school moms that have
volleyball games and football games so
they're not available Tuesdays and
Thursday nights I have some moms that
need to pick up 2:30 for carpool so they

[11:01]
need to pick up 2:30 for carpool so they
only work an AM shift and so I I'm not
only marketing my business to The Keeper
of the home right that wants to make her
her home beautiful women right but I
have several male clients too thank you
but but you know typically it is the
wife that's ordering the pumpkins so I
wanted it to be beautiful and
aesthetically pleasing to them but I
also knew that to grow I was going to
need a bigger team and so I wanted to
make my brand like something that people
realize like these moms are working and
they're having so much fun and they're
enjoying the using their like skill sets
of what they do in their own homes but
they're getting a flexible job right now
and I have people that are paying for
trips for their fall break they're using
all this money for their Christmas funds
someone paid for lasic someone you know
put a whole new fence at their house and
they were so proud to be able to do that
with the income they made with porch
pumpkins so if this were Shark Tank and
I knew that like this bus businesses run
by moms I'm like I'm in I'm in so fast

[12:02]
by moms I'm like I'm in I'm in so fast
like I've always said like moms make the
best employees you have to work around
their schedule sometimes but it is worth
it but like it's a huge net win shout
out to Katie like I've just the best
employees I've ever had have been not
like former moms but current moms
they're just rock stars and you remind
me a lot of my wife because she has like
a bakery business and she sells real
estate and she's all over the place and
she's only content if she's doing a ton
of stuff and just saying yes to everyone
and doing all these things so I'm
definitely vibing with what you're doing
yes absolutely I mean and moms we get
things done we just do I mean and not
that other people don't but we there is
just a a plethora of things that every
single day that we're having to manage
whether it's the schedules and and so it
just when it comes to pumpkins we get
things done you know and there was some
changes that happened to the schedules
this morning and I sent out those text
and they said got it okay great are you
familiar with Parkinson's law it's just

[13:01]
familiar with Parkinson's law it's just
the theory that like time expands or
contracts to fill whatever you throw at
it so like basically give a busy person
something to do and they'll find a way
to do it right so I think moms are so
hardworking because they have so much to
do and so they all of the unimportant
things just fall by the wayside as they
should and so they end up doing the most
and they're all the important things and
I just think it's such a good lesson of
Parkinson's law like you you put too
much on your plate and you only the best
stuff right and moms are experts at that
that's fantastic I'm so glad you just
put that to a specific law and like
phrase that is out there already because
I've always said that I'm not a fan when
people are like oh I'm busy you know I'm
like oh you're not busier than me you're
not I promise to I get it you know but
that's been my other life in the spring
when I I'm focusing on my volunteer
world but I'm you know like yeah I get
that so was switching from like saying
yes to everything and custom everything

[14:01]
yes to everything and custom everything
to packages was that the major unlock
for you in your business so I always had
packages from day one so um like my
second Instagram post is literally my
original packages with my original
pricing it is not the same anymore but I
can't take it down because I just have
to keep that like OE to like how I
started like I started with theing right
now don't go look at that look at her
updated prices please inflation is real
INF is so real and and also as you know
like as you build a Workforce when I was
doing everything myself I could charge
this price because this was my profit
margin but in order to service more
clients I have to pay employees in order
to have be able to do a, porches I have
to have three Warehouse people in Dallas
I have two Warehouse people in Houston
and so I need to make sure that my
margins stay that of a a well- ran
business and so you know those pric do
have to climb for inflation and scale

[15:02]
have to climb for inflation and scale
and so I think my big turning point
though for like really being able to
expand was going from taking every order
via my phone or like phone call or text
message or email to having my website
which we created for year two I mean I
literally year one I I had a Lily
Pulitzer notebook that was so cute hot
pink I couldn't lose it I need bright
things so I don't misplace them and I
was writing down every order we would
get home from delivering pumpkins at the
end of the day and then we would be my
husband would help me like invoice all
of these people from 9:00 to midnight
and then I would create my routes and so
now with our website I'm able
to take pre-orders see where we're at in
the different weeks and the different
zip codes and then know like okay like
this year I had to turn off week two but
I was able to keep delivery for Week 1
and three in Dallas was able to keep
them open like another 10 to 14 days

[16:02]
them open like another 10 to 14 days
because they had more holes to fill so
the website allows me to take so much
more business and then realizing like I
have a background in operations and
training when I like out of college like
I worked for a a major Restaurant Group
here in Texas and so I realized like I
can grow because I have the skill set
and I can teach and train other people
to do just what I do and I already I
know how to manage people because I used
to manage like 200 people and now I'm
managing 31 people and so you know
that's all of those things go
into why I I'm able to to grow this so
yeah it's been really fascinating all
right if you are watching this clip
right now you are watching this on
YouTube and if you are a fan of podcast
please check out my podcast while you're
at it because sometimes I have podcasts
that aren't on YouTube and sometimes I
have YouTubes that aren't on podcasts so
check out the ker office on any podcast
platform or you can go to TKO pod.com

[17:02]
platform or you can go to TKO pod.com
also my newsletter will throw that in
there there are no ads It's weekly it's
different content than my podcast and
YouTube newsletter. chrisj cerner.com
You'll see the link and we'll see you
there I want to get to the 31 people in
a minute but first the first year 2020
250 orders what do the next three years
look like till today and what do you
think you'll do this year I might have
to work backwards I should have polished
that up but so this year we're actually
at 1,034 which I wasn't even going to
announce it and say those words out loud
until I actually did it because that
feels more celebratory like when they're
done but it's pretty exciting and I've
had the opportunity to talk to several
people now so I I'd be remiss if we
didn't say that right so this year 134
last year was 850 the year before was
750 it was 650 500 250 so I I doubled my
second year but then I didn't double
right I didn't keep doubling I would go
up by like 20-ish per. that's really

[18:00]
up by like 20-ish per. that's really
helped us be able to continue to do a
great job because we're slowly growing
those porches so yeah at this point so
not just a a covid phenomenon clearly no
no and that was interesting too because
that was something that was marketed a
little bit my first year and when
different people reached out to do an
interview they're like this Dallas mom
is bringing a pumpkin patch to your door
since you can't go to one because it's
co you know essentially and it was more
than that it wasn't just so your family
could enjoy it it was like oh wait this
is actually something I enjoyed I really
I I like having this Decor piece I
didn't do this before but maybe they
didn't do it before because it was dirty
it's a lot of work it's hot you have to
go to a pumpkin patch and get all these
things and then also if you're going to
arrange them it's an art to arranging
them like yes put pumpkins on their
porch but when I'm teaching my designers
like okay and this is the porch pumpkin
method this is what this the look we go
for this is how I achieve it and it's so

[19:02]
for this is how I achieve it and it's so
interesting the again the moms the women
that have worked as like artists or
creatives or whatnot they like
immediately get it and I could let them
leave after 30 minutes and they would be
designing wow like right away my
employees that have not done something
creative but really have a passion
they're like oh I want to decorate like
this this is enjoyable I I want to do
this I want the income they might take a
little bit longer like maybe you know
call it 3 hours and like practicing on
five or six porches to understand the
method of the stacking but then when
once you do it enough you know again
moms are amazing we figure it out and
then Tada they're ready to go and so
that part's been pretty interesting too
like the creatives just they kind of get
it immediately what an unlock like
that's like the perfect vend diagram
overlap is a mom that has some sort of
creative background just makes your life
so much easier
100% I'm just now realizing this I don't

[20:01]
100% I'm just now realizing this I don't
know why I'm realizing this for the
first time but I I've interviewed a lot
of people and I'm not trying to make
your head too big but you literally
invented an industry you were the
inventor of this whole industry and it
is an industry like this will be a thing
forever in my opinion it's wild my
husband and I were talking about this
just two weeks ago before the season
started there are more and more and more
pumpkin decorating businesses popping up
right
and my first year my first two years
there weren't we didn't really see
anything but in
2022 there were even two porch
businesses that started here in DFW I
know them so like I I know that they saw
it and then I know that the other
businesses that have started have seen
the influencers that we all follow that
help that have helped my business grow
and the and people will ask me well
They're copying you and and I'm like
well no I inspired them it's just like a

[21:02]
well no I inspired them it's just like a
lawn care company or a Christmas lights
guy I can't physically do all of DFW in
Houston I certainly can't do all of
Texas and all of the US so like I
actually feel honored and thankful that
I car I figured this out and it is
something like that people can duplicate
in their own market and like look at all
these M preneurs out there like crushing
it and their designs some of them look
similar some of them have a different
like look and aesthetic but they're all
beautiful they're all pumpkins so it's
I'm pretty I'm so thankful and I'm proud
I'm proud that I was able to help
Inspire an another like round of M
preneurs I mean you know interior
designers like all of these things I
feel like it used to be more of a stuffy
you went to an office here's the
showroom and look at all these amazing
interior designers that work out of
their home office or they're a mobile
and I feel like that boom happened like
in the past 10 years in that segment and

[22:02]
in the past 10 years in that segment and
so this is like a whole new segment of
opportunity for people so pumpkin
Farmers keep growing pumpkins please we
need them and the thing is like you have
proximity bias like you're in the weeds
you see the competitors but like the
average American to this day has no idea
this exists and probably in 10 years
we'll have no idea this exists because
isn't that wild we're only like early or
late in any industry once you look back
on and it's done right so like
e-commerce for instance it's been around
since the 9s but in the grand scheme of
things we're still very early like only
16% of our dollars are spent online
today right so you are like extremely
early and like there's so much room to
run here and it was really interesting
with this going viral before our
conversation because I was able to see
like what the general public thinks and
you've probably seen and heard all these
things but a lot of things people say
are like who has money for this and it's
like okay there's 35 million Texans she

[23:00]
like okay there's 35 million Texans she
serves a thousand of them like certainly
a thousand Texans have money for this
likein park has 2,000 homes and that's
one neighborhood in one city yes indeed
exactly exactly what does your average
customer look like is it a Highland Park
mom with A5 to20 million house or is
your average customer in a 700,000 1.5
million house I think it's like five or
six zip codes where I do 40% of my
business is Highland Park PR and Hollow
buff you all like that area you know
just north of downtown between 75 and um
Tollway and so you know yes most of
those homes are at least $1 million if
not 38 10 12 and so that is my average
customer well I wouldn't say my aage
that's my like number one market segment
of customer I think my average customer
is probably in a $650,000 to $800,000
home that they're decorating pumpkins
with and the home homes that aren't that
much they are the ones that see the

[24:02]
much they are the ones that see the
business love the idea busy working and
they want to create memories and bring
something for their families and so
they're getting that wonderful package
four and the package four is my cash cow
it is the lowest price point is
$325 you can add design it it is I sell
the most of them and interestingly
enough I'll say a point so it's $325
it's $75 for design and $5 if you want
us to pick it up at the end of the
season but you have to remember some of
these beautiful homes in University Park
that could easily purchase a package one
that's $1350 if they wanted to they're
those beautiful homes in Dallas that are
the narrow walkway with a single door
and maybe one or two steps they don't
have room for a package one yeah they
have room for a package four and if we
tried to put a package one at their
house that would be a whole other thing
and so I do I sell the most package ones
and with the add-on design you know a

[25:00]
and with the add-on design you know a
lot of people still want to do it their
themselves and they just don't want to
do the heavy lifting of the pumpkin so I
think it's like
420 package fours out of the 1033 so
it's not quite half but it it's quite a
bit and so I sell a lot of those and
also but when it all goes to the
business aspect people are like oh which
package do you make the most money on
and I was like well it's interesting
because obviously I make more dollar
amount on my package one because it's
more expensive but it also takes up more
room on a trailer yeah I also it takes
my driver longer to unload it who I pay
hourly and I pay my designer more
because they're there longer for their
for the pumpkin design as well so it
kind of
all I wouldn't say it evens out but it
it's interesting how it all averages out
for profitability the number one
question is what are your margins like
what are you willing to share about that
think of it this way if if you do end up
selling a course or something this will
inspire people to come to you for help I

[26:00]
inspire people to come to you for help I
want those margins right right right so
my margins are really great because I
have a like all of the other background
and I am willing to take on an insane
amount of work right so that viral video
that you reposted showed showed me
running and sprinting to a house right
where I personally designed 21 houses
that day so that means I am not paying a
designer for 21 homes I only paid a
designer for like 20 homes that day I
did 50 total but some of those were DIY
so my margins are great I also have a
really hard $10,000 day that's a $10,000
day just in the design fee that I like I
earmark for myself this is kind of funny
like so my assistant helps me keep track
of everyone's payroll and things like
that and so I always tell her I'm like
you pay me the most I get paid $75 per
design right so just in design fees I
made $1,500
on that one day but you would think with

[27:01]
on that one day but you would think with
a team of 31 I could just manage
everyone and show up and do Instagram
and social media but I don't I'm on a
route every single day today I have two
so I'm on a mid and a pm. where I will
do 14 homes and so anyway I say all of
this to say like my margins are really
good I run right at like 40 to 45%
depending on the season gross or
net okay this is when you're going to
laugh
a I'm a brilliant business mind but I
don't know all these words so like
that's okay so let's say let's say you
you like uh gross would be like a
million dollars in sales and then your
pumpkins cost 500,000 so that would be
50% gross margins but net would be after
all of your other costs paying your
people like your true bottom line profit
would be net my net is 40% profit
margin my mind's exping right now that's
low that's low but again it's because

[28:00]
low that's low but again it's because
that's that's not low by any standard
well no like okay it's not low but like
one like my season one it was a 50%
profit margin because my husband and I
were doing 90% of the work and then I
was just having a little bit of help you
know yeah a lot more work more profit
lot more work and so and that's why it's
like okay on a and we've learned how to
Source the pumpkins and we know how to
be the most efficient and like all of
these efficiency pieces are so helpful
so two years ago we were probably a
little bit under 40 at like more maybe
more like 35% profit margin and so
because we had that big growth of sales
and people and
employees and so we had to finesse some
things out and so that's yeah that's
part of why knew it yeah if when I do
the course I will be a plethora of
information and so many people are like
oh do you have a few minutes I'd like to
pick your brain and that's so no you get

[29:00]
pick your brain and that's so no you get
this like that's like thank thank you
for the kind message of how I've
inspired you but no I 10 minutes I I
don't have time for you to pick my brain
and I worked really hard and I have a
lot of inside information that could
save you I mean I I went through I've
worked now we this is five seasons and
that's just in the business the pumpkins
alone the previous nine years were like
a whole another well that math doesn't
work my son's only 11 so the previous
six years and just those pumpkins and
learning what I learned there like I
mean that's a whole another like that's
one class and then running the business
is another class and growing and scaling
could be another one you know and I
could talk all day about pumpkins I love
it I love the business I love I love my
people my people are amazing I could not
do this without my team my team is
incredible and they all like want to
make people just as happy as I do so
like you can't you just don't get better
than that well you've instilled that
culture that's a top down culture from
you you hire people that are like you

[30:00]
you you hire people that are like you
right so then the company is a
representation of Heather yes yes I love
that your profits are good because you
you deserve for them to be good and I
just want to go to all the haters in the
comments and be like you're wrong you're
wrong you're wrong like this is just not
a type of business where you should have
low margins it's just not because it's
not something that people have to pay
for therefore like it's a nice to have
right so you should Eno and it's hard
like people like oh yeah I can do that
and it's like have you ever lifted 30 to
70 lb pumpkins all day long like
hundreds and thousands of pumpkins all
day long for 16 hours straight like be
my guest right come on we well we're not
really hiring but come on I'll I'll take
that extra tra D next year come check it
out do you think that a recession would
negatively affect you or since because
of the fact that you're growing so much
year-over-year you you might just grow
less I was concerned about this year to
be fair not that we're in a full
recession right now but the average

[31:01]
recession right now but the average
American is not spending money that they
used to they have less money to spend as
everything is higher and I still service
some lovely average Americans and so
those my package four some of my package
4 clients in my suburbs I Was preparing
for those numbers to fall off and with
my growth my planned growth that I
wanted to succeed and hit this year I in
July I took head shot with a one and a k
because you know I have to do that then
to celebrate later and so that was the
goal I think due to the current even
status of the economy I did not sell out
as fast as I did last year so last year
I sold out on my with 850 porches on
August 15th 15th or 14th and this year I
quit taking orders on September like 7th
so it took two and a half 3 weeks more

[32:01]
so it took two and a half 3 weeks more
longer of growth of of time to hit that
right versus yeah last year I probably
already had 200 people on the weight
list a week after I closed so I do think
it's already like it's slowing some
people down from this
more lavish luxury thing to do and then
the other interesting analytic is
watching People's package
fluctuations because the way my website
captures like my data is that I can see
like what they ordered this year versus
last year and I really thought that a
lot of people would package down this
year and so there for my sales wouldn't
be quite as high because you know I'd
still have so many porches my averages
stayed about the same but it's been kind
of a flip-flop a lot of people did
package down but just as many people
packaged up so I I thought that it would
affect me so do I think Mo like moving

[33:00]
affect me so do I think Mo like moving
forward in a year or two if we are in a
recession I think it'll go back to very
similarly like I will have to change my
business style and model which I like to
sell out on August 15th that gives me
five weeks of planning before my season
starts this year I had to do things
differently in order to hit my goal I I
would even say it go as far to say I had
to do things the way I don't like to do
them to hit my goal and I had to stretch
my own self and comfort zone and so I
did that because there's so much that
goes on the back end that is not
Instagram worthy you can't make a reel
out of it it's me looking at Excel
spreadsheets all day right so yeah I
just I think that's interesting I I do
think that it would it would taper I
think the growth would taper down I
think I would stay consistent during a
recession because I'm still going to
have that top two five% of people and
income earners they're less affected by
a recession they're less affected you

[34:00]
a recession they're less affected you
know and so with it being more of a
luxury business I mean sure Neiman
marcus' sales go down slightly in a
recession and you know I likely would as
well so yeah two things I want to just
go on the record and say like in in the
viral reel that I made about you you had
never told or posted about having a
thousand orders all I knew was that you
did 900 last year from an
entrepreneur.com article and I just knew
I know she's going to break a thousand
so I'm going to put it out there because
she probably already had and so now I
found out that I'm right I didn't lie
that's number one number two is I think
especially you should not worry about a
recession you specifically because a you
invented the industry B you have an
Instagram following where you can teach
people how to do this and in a recession
the middle class moms are going to be
think looking around thinking how can I
make extra money to pay for Christmas
maybe I can decorate some porches maybe
I could go to Heather and buy her course
right like I think a recession could
really help your course sales and
because of the fact most of your
customers are higher end thousand homes

[35:00]
customers are higher end thousand homes
in Dallas you could sell 5,000 of these
in fris alone right like if you would
really saturated the market so right
that's incredible well I know your time
is very valuable and you literally have
pumpkins to deliver today it's October
first so it's a big day we're so excited
any parting words you'd like to leave
with people I'm also curious on about
like what chips you have on your
shoulder like what drives you what kind
of haters drive you or comment or I love
talking about people that just have a
chip on their shoulder they don't really
think about it actively but it's there I
love this I have two tips on my
shoulders one for any entrepreneur
that's out there starting this is just
for anyone don't listen to the naysayers
if you have a great idea and you want to
price something somewhere that someone
else doesn't agree with people never pay
for that people never pay for that they
just don't understand you know I can't
tell you how many people were like
Heather who's going to buy $11,000 worth

[36:01]
Heather who's going to buy $11,000 worth
of pumpkins who's going to buy $750
worth of pumpkins I was like I don't
know but I think that there's a market
for it because I just found out that
these three Christmas light guys are
trying to quote me 1,200 1400 and ,600
for my house so someone's paying that
much money for Christmas lights
someone's going to pay this much money
for pumpkins someone would pay that much
money for XYZ whatever your business so
don't cut yourself short because you're
afraid to price what your business is so
that's my one like tip because you will
and there are like you know I actually
have like a really positive following
and most of people on my personal
Instagram are like here for it and
they're excited and they like to see the
pumpkins it's when they kind of get
their reare that's sometimes when you
get the haters if you will it goes to a
broader audience but and that's fine I
get it this is not for everyone and also
not everyone lives in DFW and
understands like our city like our city
is not not often refected affected by a
lot of recessions our city is very

[37:01]
lot of recessions our city is very
wealthy you know overall so I understand
that my second chip on my shoulder as a
business owner it's I love like I said
earlier like I love that people have
been inspired by this business model and
it is popping up I've seen different
ones some places I've even had people
like I've had the kindest women reach
out to me send me a photo of their logo
with their website and just saying like
like I just wanted to share that I found
you you know a year ago two years ago
and I was just in awe and I'm just so
thankful for this business and look this
is what I have created and I just wanted
you to see it and I love when people
share that with like I literally have
Goosebumps right now like I love that
right like that is so cool that this has
all happened this way but what I do have
a large chip on my shoulder on is when
like we went through all the right
channels to like trademark and copyright
like my logo and that that covers like

[38:01]
like my logo and that that covers like
all of my intellectual property which
are my photos like my photos are my
intellectual property and so when people
are like oh this is a great idea here
let me screenshot these and act like
they're my work you know and they'll
post them on their Instagram or their
website oh no that part that is like a
dagger in the heart you know of course
we move forward with a nice little legal
letter and I've actually had to get a
lawyer involved a few times just because
one well one it is my intellectual
property 100% And you are lying if
you're trying to use that photo saying
that this is what you're offering you
know but too like I worked so hard my
first year I discounted things to get
those and other people can too there's
like ways to go about it so that would
be my business owner chip on my shoulder
and I don't think about it often until
some sweet person in Columbus Ohio who's
been following me since 2020 and we're
like porch pumpkins family sends me a a

[39:03]
like porch pumpkins family sends me a a
a website saying I found this and I just
it Hur it hurts my heart that someone's
stealing your things and so I mean
that's how I find out I'm not out
actively looking for it my porch
pumpkins family is like extremely like
loving and protective of what they know
I have created and so I think that I
mean I think that's pretty amazing too
I'm like so thankful and there I just I
feel so loved I feel I feel so loved so
that's amazing well most most
entrepreneurs don't realize that a large
portion of their success is driven by
those people that are ripping off your
images and talking crap like so in a way
we got to be grateful for him right
because we wouldn't be as driven without
him but I always say only listen to the
haters when they know more about your
industry than you which is almost never
the case right so if you had talked to a
mentor like I did the porch pumpkin
business and honestly the price point is
very sensitive once you get above $500
it's like okay that's valid no you
invented this right people will pay for
it and the vast majority of business

[40:02]
it and the vast majority of business
owners are much more likely to
underprice themselves and it comes from
Fear comes from insecurity like oh I
don't want to and that is a mistake like
that is a mistake raise your prices
absolutely you know and that's so
fascinating that you said that too I
have a cousin that's a hair stylist
right and she works for herself she said
something years ago when her books get
full right when she's 100% booked all
the time she goes up on her prices MH
because that will clear out the bottom
tier 85 to 90% of people will continue
on and it opens up 10% of her books for
people to pay the higher tier and that
fascinating too and that's what made
that conversation probably seven years
ago she's had her business for like 15
now that conversation when I realized
that as I was scaling and I was needing
to hire more people I did need to go up
on my prices MH because I needed
it's supply and demand and it gave me

[41:00]
it's supply and demand and it gave me
that conversation gave me the confidence
to do it and so that's why if you do go
back to my very first my very second
post on Instagram and you see a package
for used to be
$250 it's now $325 and that's because
price pumpkins went up and labor Etc is
a part of that dollar amount now so
that's amazing well we don't have time
for any of this but I I want I'm going
give you some homework I want you to
look into comfy UI it's this new
software that will enable your customers
to upload a picture of their porch and
then AI will automatically show them
what's possible with it right this like
wasn't possible six months ago so comfy
AI wow UI comfy UI oh UI UI yeah so look
into that and then I'm sure you're
already thinking about Christmas like I
I got another Revenue line for Christmas
are you already kind of thinking that
way so the thing about me is I
absolutely love Christmas but I reserve
Christmas for my family I do six

[42:00]
Christmas for my family I do six
Christmas trees in our home our house is
the like epitome you're Christmas I am I
am and I love Christmas and so where
I've had people again since I started
please come decorate my tree you know
one one of my Christmas trees takes me
six hours to decorate right and so I
know that like the Christmas de like uh
proper like being a decorator is not
where I'm going to go but I am working
on something for the holiday season that
is interest that is kind of a similar
business model of pumpkins being dropped
off I'm actually working on partnering
with someone oh awesome that's smart
they have a great product already and
it's something that North Texans
especially use in the holiday season and
so I'm working on partnering with him to
offer something for Christmas season so
yeah I'm excited about yeah yeah you
don't want to be more frazzled than you
already are for Christmas no and I want

[43:01]
already are for Christmas no and I want
and I do need a season of rest because
then you know I quit my last day of
pumpkin delivery in theory is October
11th we might have a few trickle Downs
October 12th just if there's some
delivery snafus and so then like I go on
a solid pause but then on November 1st
we offer pickup and so a lot of people
that have already had their pumpkins
sitting on their porch for five weeks
that November air hits and they're ready
to decorate for Christmas so they're
like Heather can you come pick up my
pumpkins and so we actually start
routing to pick up pumpkins and we do
that all the way from November 1st and
typically I say that we pick up our
pumpkins by December 1st but this year
Thanksgiving falls the latest it ever
does which is November 28th so I'm going
to need a few more days than three days
to pick up all the pumpkins but by
December 3rd I would say we'll have all
the pumpkins picked up and then
punctuated I'm done so even like with my
business if if I wanted to do a proper
Christmas something I mean I would have
to have things really in place ahead of

[44:02]
to have things really in place ahead of
time because my season goes until the
last set of pumpkins are picked up which
is the 1 of December you would have no
break yeah you would go crazy no what
percentage of your customers opt for a
pickup in November I didn't run the
numbers this year yet but my best guess
is about 65 to 70% of my client base
yeah and and can you do anything with
those pumpkins other than throw them
away yes so we oh wait the customer or
me you like once you pick them up yes so
when we pick them up we actually we
picked them up in dump trailers like big
huge dump trailers and we dropped them
off at a local farm and we they use the
pumpkins to feed their I don't remember
the type of pig it is but it's a pig
that's raised for Slaughter for bacon
and then it's actually a charity farm so
then they use that Revenue to help pay
employees and it's incredible and then
the hey well our hay is actually straw
but the straw they use for their chicken

[45:00]
but the straw they use for their chicken
coops and their goats and things like
that and so all of the things that we
pick up are going they're it's not
necessarily com I mean they're going to
feed farm animals and things like that
so we're so proud of that and we're so
thankful for that partnership as well
that's awesome well Heather thank you
