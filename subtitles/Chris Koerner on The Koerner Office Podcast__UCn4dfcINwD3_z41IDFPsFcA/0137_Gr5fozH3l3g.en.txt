[00:00]
so let's call it just to be clean and
conservative 3,000 businesses in DFW
that may need to grind a stump for their
customer their homeowner customer at
some point okay okay yesterday I
actually ran tests for this I texted 200
tree business owners and this is exactly
what I texted them I will read it
[Music]
verbatim for those who don't know we own
a tree terming business it's pretty
small and our whole model is we don't do
any actual work
we Outsource everything okay we own a
truck we have an operating partner
that's it we don't have a warehouse we
don't have overhead we don't have
employees we don't have a chainsaw we
have a truck we have James right yeah
and it was purposeful just like for
people who are listening because in
order for us to get into the tree
trimming game we would have had to
expend a lot of capital in buying a
truck and equipment or we could generate
the leads and sub out the work until we
got to a place that we were big enough
to bring that in housee and then we
could see our margins go up but anyways
yes yeah cuz like our therapists and

[01:01]
yes yeah cuz like our therapists and
wives and friends and family and mentors
frequently tell us we're not quote good
operators right whatever that means
whatever that means whatever we're not
quote good at the game of business you
know what I mean yeah yeah we're quote
failures that's that's what Patrick says
anyway so this idea flies in the face of
our whole thesis which is operationally
light marketing heavy okay okay but
here's what I love okay so Aaron Harper
CEO of rolling Suds he built a a
franchise called patch boys patch
Brothers where all they did all they did
was drywall patching that's it okay and
it's a great business it's high margin
it's like a $400 minimum for a half
day's work or 800 for a full day's work
and it's brilliant because you show up
you've got one hole in the wall but
everyone has stuff like other smaller
things and it's like listen you're going
to pay me 400 bucks no matter what might
as well knock out a few more things and

[02:01]
as well knock out a few more things and
it's just very Niche very targeted and
so I don't remember if he told me this
or not but I think the whole model is
B2B referrals right handyman refers
drywall work contractors referral
they're not really going directly to
Consumers that much they don't avoid it
but they're just getting a ton of
referrals right yeah and so if we were
to do the tree business completely
differently based on what James and I
have learned so far it's really hard to
find stump grinding because most of our
subs don't own to own a stump grinder
but guess what if you remove a tree
you've got to get the stump out of there
and it cost money and so what our subs
normally do is they'll go to United or
one of the big rental places and this is
literally how it is you drive there you
wait in line you sign a form and then
you go out in the lot and they load up
this big heavy stump grinder into your
truck or into your trailer and then you
take it back to the job site it could be
30 45 minutes away you grind the tree
which which takes 30 minutes you load it

[03:01]
which which takes 30 minutes you load it
back up and you drive it back to the
rental place now the rental place might
be out of stock and you waste time or
they might be too expensive you got to
price it out like it's very inefficient
and it's not it's like a loss leader no
one really makes money on Stump Grinding
unless they have a dedicated stump
grinding business and so landscapers
need stump grinders hardscapers tree
businesses like mostly tree businesses
use stump grinders but anything
landscape needs a stump grinder at some
point let me ask you this I I get the
premise right
like a homeowner has their tree trimmed
or or tree removed they've got the stump
and then they say what every spouse of
an ampute says like I can't look at that
stump anymore and that was bad I had to
anyways what are they doing right now
with it what do they do with the stump
do they call another sub like when we go
the
tree hold on when we go and remove a
tree and we leave what does the
homeowner do after we leave like how do
they get rid of this stump sometimes the

[04:01]
they get rid of this stump sometimes the
stump stays but usually we bake that
into our quote so what what James will
do is he'll say he'll quote it let's say
he knows a removal is going to cost us
500 bucks and then he knows our the
stump removal is going to cost us 200
bucks so he'll go in there and quote
1400 and say listen it's going to be
1400 remove the tree you still need to
get the stump removed if you close today
we're just going to roll that in for
free so he he quotes it like like it's
free but he bakes it into the price and
then we just work it into the quote and
it's just a break even loss leader okay
how much are stump grinders to buy mhm
from $4,000 to $150,000
$150,000 yeah okay let's say we bought
one like what are we looking at 40 40 to
60 40 to 60 and then you need to buy a 5
to $10,000 trailer and a truck to pull
it of course okay so we're looking at 75
grand uh-huh that's actually like

[05:01]
grand uh-huh that's actually like
exactly what I got to okay okay now hear
me out let's say we test this concept
because that's what we do we test things
we don't go all in on anything until
we've tested it yeah right we test these
I'm I'm still testing my marriage it's
been 16 years we're going to see if this
works you know so spoiler alert it did
not we've done the the scraping we know
the research we know that in DFW
population 9 million people there are
right around a thousand tree dreaming
businesses and there's around 2 to 3,000
Landscaping businesses and that includes
Crews that just cut grass okay yeah so
let's call it just to be clean and
conservative 3,000 businesses in DFW
that may need to grind a stump for their
customer their homeowner customer at
some point okay okay yesterday I
actually ran tests for this I texted 200
tree business owners and this is exactly
what I texted them I will read it
verbatim I said and this wasn't really
strategic I I didn't have a lot of time

[06:01]
strategic I I didn't have a lot of time
and so I didn't do the most strategic
thing I did the time-saving thing the
most strategic thing would have texted
with my first text simply would have
been hey do you do stump grinding and
then I would have got about a 40 to 60%
response rate but then I would have had
to respond again with the pitch instead
of that I just went straight with the
pitch I said hey man I kind of keep it
informal do you own your own stump
grinder or do you rent slub it out I
only do stump grinding for tree
businesses here at DFW any need for
Reliable Subs um so I'm trying to
qualify here I want to know because a
lot of tree businesses own a stump
grinder and they don't need to sub it
out a lot of them rent it a lot of them
just don't do it and so I wasn't super
enthused by the response more people
owned a stump grinder than I thought and
then some people rent it out and some
people you know three or four people
were like yeah I need good subs and I
know that people need good Subs because
we've been at this for a year and we
still need good Subs Subs that is always

[07:00]
still need good Subs Subs that is always
there will always be a need for business
owners to need good subs and so it was
pretty decent not as good as I thought
but I'm also toxically optimistic and so
no surprise there but here's the
thinking I've crunched the numbers on
this James said your average stump which
is about 18 inches pause your jokes
costs about
$350 okay now if there's two stumps
there you might be looking at 500
because you're already there you already
made the trip it's a lot cheaper once
you go two plus okay okay if it's like
one 24 inch stump then you looking at
450 and you can set up a pricing system
to where like you add $10 per inch right
please hold your jokes
so I'm not gonna say I just lost I just
lost my train of thought see it's like
either I can lose my train of thought
telling you to not make a joke or I can
lose my train of thought when you make a
joke either way I'm I lose you can do
different pricing models depending on a
per inch basis you can standardize it
standard okay and then you've got like

[08:02]
standard okay and then you've got like
do you remove the chips or do you leave
them there that's an extra price or you
take a step further do you remove the
chips and fill in the ho with soil do
you know how stump grinding works first
of all do you know anything about
this I've seen it done and I know how
the machine works and how they come in
back fill that's enough well I don't
know what you're specifically asking me
like what it looks like to grind a stump
like what the machine how the Machine
Works yes
okay it's like a big chainsaw
yeah on it you're going like it's like
you're cutting the lawn right but you're
going back and forth and back and forth
you're going left to right right yeah
you're like swiping it slowly until it's
gone and you have to go like six inches
below the surface of the Earth yeah we
had a big tree in our backyard removed
and they ground half the stump and then
the rest of the stump was just sitting
in there so we had actually have them
come back out and anyways it was a whole
big issue but yeah it's you have to do
it right otherwise it screws the lawn up

[09:01]
it right otherwise it screws the lawn up
too yeah and there's other ways to do it
like you can get a big excavator and you
can literally just scoop out this dump
but that leaves like a gaping hole that
you rip out all the roots and that's the
most efficient when you're clearing land
because you can just do B B B you can
just pull them all out and then smooth
it but 80 90% of the time in a yard even
if there's 10 stumps it makes the most
sense to grind it okay and so anyway I
texted 200 people I only got a 15%
response rate which is really low but
once again I went hard with the pitch
from the get-go and a few people were
like yeah I'll let you know I'll call
you whereas those like if you follow up
with those on a regular basis they
actually will because it's inefficient
to go rent a machine on a loss leader
right it just it doesn't make sense and
so here's the thinking you take 3,000
businesses in
DFW now I know this is like number porn
and it all looks good we could just get
1% exactly just hear me out hear me out
I asked James how many stumps do we

[10:00]
I asked James how many stumps do we
grind a month so this is real data says
8 to 10 okay let's say the average let's
say landscapers do less tree terming
companies do more let's say it's six six
per month per company we get 5% of the
DFW Market we do exactly what I did with
LCD cycle and that's take a database and
hit every single person on that database
in a CRM notes by every single one so
like it's tunnel vision all you know all
you see are these 3,000 names and you're
just working it that's it very specific
yeah you get five 5% of the market to
refer to you six to eight jobs per month
let's say it's 350 per job right which
is the bare minimum some jobs will be a
th000 some will be might be 250
conservative is 350 5% of the market is
150 companies we're not going to
Consumers at all we're just getting
referrals from current businesses each
of them do seven stumps per month at 350
each that's 360 Grand 367 Grand per
month in revenue or 4.4 million per year

[11:03]
month in revenue or 4.4 million per year
that would be 40 jobs per working day
conservatively five jobs per day which
that's very conservative because even a
huge stump takes like 20 minutes to
grind and if you're doing 40 a day then
you can really make efficient routes
where they're all pretty close yeah I
mean it just depends on yeah agreed yeah
so five jobs per day it's a oneman crew
one man one truck one grinder one
trailer okay that would be eight Crews
of one person each and then one manager
so nine people let's say you pay them
100 Grand each which is very generous
maybe you're paying the manager 200
you're paying everyone else 80 you do
commission upsells yada Yad y you're
looking at 1.2 million a year in Labor
uh that's including like payroll costs
and all that gas I crunch the numbers on
gas this is pretty accurate 200 Grand a
year I don't know exactly what repairs
would be so I just said 200 Grand a year
on that let's say Insurance you got to
have kind of central storage unit

[12:00]
have kind of central storage unit
something to place backup equipment if
in case something breaks down another
200 Grand so you're looking at 1.8
million per year in cost which would be
2.6 million a year in profit at 5% of
the market only DFW only stump grinding
only B2B no consumer stuff one stump per
job so that would be profit but
obviously in the first year you'd have
to spend if you said eight Crews yep
eight Crews but you you work up to that
right I'm just saying $600,000 just
buying the stump grinders themselves so
there'd be some big capex here's my
question for you this is kind of a
curveball I've started thinking about
things this way as we talk about
businesses because there are tons of
opportunities but you and I are trying
to get out of operationally heavy
businesses is there a way where we could
turn this into a marketing business
where we go to existing companies and
say hey would you like to add an
additional X dollars of Revenue to your

[13:00]
additional X dollars of Revenue to your
business pay us we'll show you the
business plan we'll do the marketing for
you only thing you have to do on your
end is spend $75,000 to buy the stump
grinder and then obviously we'd have to
share in some of the profits of Revenue
or we're just strictly an agency but
then the the capital investment would NE
not necessarily be on us but it would be
on the company that's already operating
they already have access to Crews they
already know the area they have some
name recognition and then we could just
be the agency that helps them grow
through that marketing channel what
would you think of doing that that could
work and you don't need to convince
someone to buy a grinder either there
are people that do this like only
grinding right that is a thing we would
just need to be their lead generation
Source right you know so like
potentially less upside potentially less
profit of ownership but significantly
less risk significantly less Capital
expenditures
upfront and yep like a lot more
scalable yep yep and another thing you

[14:00]
scalable yep yep and another thing you
could do which is like meet in the
middle of what we both just said is you
can rent these $50,000 sum grinders for
3,000 a month and so you can queue up
the pipeline and then just test it out
for a month we could have James do it
James could be the guy he could be
grinding he could be doing all that
himself for a month we could say we
could say like ignore all this tree
stuff for a month we're going to turn
off our marketing channels let's test
this let's do this because he's told me
like this is a pain point this is stump
grinding is a paino there is a market
for this it's not like we're like
hypothetically thinking this up like
we're in the business you know here
would be my question if it's a pain
Point why is nobody doing this yet like
why hasn't it been done why wasn't
anyone franchising you know drywall
patching like you know when we're
looking at businesses to invest in
that's like your number one question
right if somebody's coming to you and
they're like hey we just got to do this
and there's no competitors in the market
like you're the first one to be like
okay so why is nobody doing doing it in

[15:00]
okay so why is nobody doing doing it in
in your opinion like why do you think
nobody's doing it and that could be the
answer just like oh well nobody's
thought of it yet but well people are
doing it it's just not it's not
saturated enough like there there are
stump grinding businesses I think most
stump grinding businesses and it's a
perfect business for a firefighter I I
knew a police sergeant that did this on
the side because he had free time it's a
perfect business for that which is very
similar to the tree business but they're
not thinking of it being a B2B business
that that's the whole angle they're
going to Consumers posting on Facebook
marketplace right and here's another
thing that's a genius about this okay
with both this business and the tree
business you cannot quote virtually you
just can't the close rate isn't High the
tree is a lot bigger in person even if
you FaceTime them yeah you and this I've
been I've been reading forums for stump
grinding because I was thinking stump
grinding is a little different because
it's more binary like you could say how
get your tape measure tell me how thick
it is I'm more of a nonbinary guy but
okay people are saying you still have to

[16:01]
okay people are saying you still have to
go quote in person but here's the genius
about this we don't have to because we
already have a tree guy there on site he
just needs to know our pricing structure
he needs to pull out the tape measure or
just send us a picture and we can use an
app to to judge how right you know what
I'm saying like he closes the deal he's
our salesperson and then he knows
exactly what we're going to charge he
works that into his quote we don't ever
have to go look at it we just show up
and do the job and leave so it's half as
much logistical work half as much
driving yeah that and that's why I like
the idea of letting someone else do the
execution piece of it like okay cool
this is how you price these are the
leads that are coming in you handle the
stump grinder you handle the quoting you
handle the actual execution of the job
it could be a really good agency play as
well yeah I just I like this because
it's even more of a binary outcome
business than trees you know like you
just get the stump out oh like it's just
it's very you do it or you don't whereas
like house painting or Roofing it's like
there's a lot of different ticky tacky

[17:00]
there's a lot of different ticky tacky
ways you can screw up I want to tell you
how we could test this even further than
my quick 30 minute texting test okay
okay James helped me formulate this idea
so I was thinking a lot of these
business owners and you can see on the
spreadsheet when I scrape them are
Hispanic right their last name ends with
s or S
right I was texting James and you can
find very cheap cult colors in Latin
American comp countries like Mexico well
that' be good I was like James we could
scrape out all of the Hispanic sounding
business owners and cold call them with
a VA from upwork in Spanish okay how
well would that
sell okay and then James said something
and he didn't really mean this but I was
like wait are you saying that we should
use a Hispanic cold caller to cold call
everyone he's like well not really but
that could be I'm like that could
definitely be good we could even give we
could find a cold callar have them test
for 30 days they're Rockstar we love
them hear me out hear hear me out we
give him a percentage of the business

[18:01]
give him a percentage of the business
like literally 1% and we pay him a fair
market rate right and so when he calls
whether he calls someone if he calls
someone that's Hispanic he speaks in
Spanish if he calls someone that's white
he speaks in English and his pitch is
like hey I'm a co-owner of this company
and this is our pitch and yada Yad yada
and I just feel like if he were to be
selling to Americans it's a stronger
pitch because the assumption is that
he's hispanic he's not going to charge
that much his price is good and if he
calls Hispanics it's even better
right right I think it's a great idea I
think you're going to where the market
need is and addressing it I think it's
smart yeah so I want to take a list of a
hundred people like let's say 50
landscapers 50 tree businesses find a VA
tell him what the plan is and say I or
maybe even 200 people because I want him
to get a 100 on the phone pay him 500
bucks or something and say take very
tedious notes and I want to know exactly
what does the market say is this there
or is this not and then once you get

[19:02]
or is this not and then once you get
verbal yeah you know what I subed this
out already so I'll give you a shot or
yeah you know what I already rent these
I don't want to rent them anymore I'll
give you a shot then we can do exactly
what we do with our Realtors with our
TCH outbound marketing campaigns and we
could just follow up with them every
single week automated fully automated
like hey man any stump jobs for me you
know what's interesting and it's a
tangent but hang with me for a second we
went to Utah two weeks ago and the
people that we stayed with Bryce he
works at qualtrix and his job at
qualtrix is I don't remember exactly
what it is like data Integrity or or
something he manages the relationship
but but there are a lot of companies
that pay qualtrix for um market research
and so I was asking him I'm like well
okay you you have a pool of people
they're trying to test the market how
many people do you need in order for it
to be statistically significant and he
was like 387 is the number what yeah
it's like oddly It's oddly specific
that's like that makes you believe him

[20:00]
that's like that makes you believe him
so much more if he were to say about 400
you're like okay whatever dude I know I
know right he's like I tell people 400
but it's 387 I'm like okay walk me
through that he's like okay for every
like 10 people that you add to a data
set before
387 the what's the word the confidence
interval increases dramatically right
but once you get to 387 it's like at
that 95% and it may go to like 95.1 or
95.2 but the rate at which it increases
is significantly less so we so 387 is
the number obviously if you're trying to
test all these disperate markets maybe
you need 387 in Detroit and 387 in Miami
Etc but 387 is like the minimum
statistical amount that you need in
order to feel confident and the reason
I'm bringing that up is a I thought it
was cool but B if we tested this and it
was like all right we called 400
business owners and these were the
percentage response rates then we have a
much higher level of confidence in
whether or not there's a there there in

[21:01]
whether or not there's a there there in
testing it and and 400 to me is doable
yes it would cost us some money but it's
very doable for us to get a response
from 400 of these business owners yeah I
agree because like I texted 200 I got a
15% response rate through 30 people
responded I have no idea what the other
170 people are thinking if we call them
on the phone I think back to how many
times you've done these types of tests
in things that you've launched like and
any time that you've done one where got
more than 400
responses has that played out has it
been like oh yeah that was validating to
talk to that many people like you've
done a lot of these types of cold
campaigns where you've reached out and
tried to get information from
people does that number sound right to
you like is it like yeah if we had that
many I'd feel 400's a lot yeah I because
that would be that would be 400 people
you talk to or text with right not just
people that you reach out to at least
400 people you get data from correct
that's a lot yeah that would be very
very strong like I would for sure launch
a business if it looked good after I

[22:01]
a business if it looked good after I
spoke to 400 people I mean and he was
also saying like you can do smaller data
sets depending on the quality of the
respondents right so yeah there probably
less respondents needed in order for us
to get a good sense of where the market
is but I just found that interesting
that like 387 was and I may be like off
somebody listening to this some data
scientist listening to this was like
technically speaking actually if you
look at the standard deviation you
actually can't go past Sigma because
once Sigma becomes an alpha the beta
kicks in and if you're a Beta Sigma
anyways that's awesome anyway so I've
been I've been excited about that I
think I think it's a great idea I love
it yeah all right what do you got what
do you got you got a match I don't know
if it'll be as good but I hope you're
ready for this it won't you know who
Tyler pel is on
Twitter okay so Tyler yeah I talked to
him and what I do anytime I have an
interview I record the interview and
then I take some notes during the
interview but I listen back to it
after what after it's been edited and

[23:00]
after what after it's been edited and
we're about to release it and I take a
bunch of notes and in the notes I like
to hit on numbers I like to be very
specific because it's it's a 30-minute
conversation but if I'm trying to get
someone to listen to it I want them to
hear upfront like hey here are the high
level facts right so I did this with
Tyler and as I was listening back to it
it just was like boggling my mind this
business so he has a laundromat he got
into the business because his
father-in-law had an original laundromat
bought into it had some equity and
they've now opened three laundromats
from scratch so they found locations and
then they built them from
scratch and so they're beautiful
laundromats but here's what's crazy to
me these are the economics of the
business I don't know if you knew this
do you
know I guess like what is a average
laundromats Revenue just one location
average laundromat I would say mid six
figures okay 785 I think was the number
that Tyler gave me right it was like 78
5 is like the average revenue is that

[24:00]
5 is like the average revenue is that
like his laundromat or an actual average
cuz some of them are small and crappy
and run down right yeah his laundr mats
and I like as we keep talking you'll see
why I'm using his as the number but yes
his laundr mats 785 after they've gotten
to like stabilization after five years
he's like they can get to like 1.2 but
I'm like okay I'll use the seven 785
number what is the noi on that the net
ating say again 35% 50%
jeez 50% it was shocking to me because
I'm like I like a real estate like you
have real estate and you have 50%
margins and so as he talked about it
with me it started making sense so his
whole strategy is he goes and he
identifies using Google Maps like okay
where are all the laundromats where do I
see a cluster of laundromats okay cool
then he then goes to that cluster like
literally physically goes to that
cluster and he looks at those
laundromats and if they're all he calls
them zombie laundromats if all zombie
laundromats like they're built 30 years

[25:00]
laundromats like they're built 30 years
ago and they just have never been
updated and they've extracted a ton of
value out of the community he's like
okay there's a market here right because
there's like he doesn't consider them a
competitor no kind of right he's looking
at that and he's like if these three
crappy laats all existing within a mile
Square radius is what he uses can
support themselves I know if I build a
brand new one in the same mile radius I
am going to get people to come to it so
I'm going to put one of at least one of
these out of business but I know that
there's demand here so then he goes and
finds the space he builds from scratch
he launches and he's done this several
times and obviously hyper successful and
his laundry match just print money but
he like went in granular detail he's
like I look in a m Square radius I look
at the demographics I look at the
schools I look at how many apartment
complexes are and whether or not they
have on-site laundry I look at the
square footage of these laundromats I
look at when they were updated so it's
like he has this whole thing but it
didn't sound super complicated to me
it's like that seems easy like we could

[26:02]
it's like that seems easy like we could
go out and literally find a square you
know a mile radius and decide hey let's
launch the laundromat here and then the
marketing he's like all we do is we have
a press release we do a community
opening event and then maybe some
Facebook marketing ads but but that's
about it and anyway he in like Ohio he
like there oh yeah okay he's in Ohio but
I was thinking more and more about this
and I'm like do you think this is we
could do like maybe we partnered with an
operator who has capital and we're like
hey look we'll just do the market
research for you we don't need to like
even have a piece maybe we have like 10%
piece but just pay us to do the market
research we'll help you find the
locations and then you build because
again I'm trying to get away from like
operationally intensive businesses and I
don't necessarily want to take out a ton
of debt in order to build these things
but it just seemed like there was
something there to me just in
identifying
opportunities for people people with
capital to go and invest and create

[27:00]
capital to go and invest and create
these to build these laundromats in
communities that are either underserved
or haven't been updated in a long time
so you're saying do you think there's a
business opportunity to do the market
research for people like Tyler yes yeah
not to go and just build it ourselves
right like obviously there's there's an
opportunity there but it's right yeah we
don't want that's capital intensive we
got to take out loans we got like it's a
whole long process could we just be a
company that's like hey Outsource to us
we'll find you the opportunities and
kick us a couple points on the deal plus
this fee right I think the hard part
with that is like they would be
Outsourcing the most important decision
or one of the most important decisions
right I would have a lot of anxiety
putting that in someone else's hand
especially if I already opened four or
five of these myself right because if
you get that wrong if some third-party
agency screws that up you could be done
Tyler's company like he's already doing
it internally they may not be the best
to do it but maybe it's a a family
office or maybe it's it's a private
Equity Fund that's like hey we want to
roll up some laundromats and you just go

[28:02]
roll up some laundromats and you just go
through the strategy of how to identify
I'm trying to marry this idea that we
have which is like we don't want to be
Capital intensive we don't want to be in
something where we're taking out a ton
of debt but we still want to take
advantage of the shift because there are
a lot of these zombie laundromats right
that were built 20 30 years ago and just
crappy and run down so there's
opportunity for you to go in leveraging
new real estate and capture the market
but how could we do that yeah I think
that's definitely an opportunity because
I know know that there are big companies
that do this for like restaurant chains
or Starbucks or coffee chains and it's
like hey here's your $10,000 report open
right here or right there so this is
already being done it the question is
like is it being done for this industry
I think the hardest part is just finding
that sub segment of the industry that
would pay for this like they can't be
too big it can't be their first location
it can't be their fifth maybe it has to
be like someone that just got funded and
they're just trying to Sprint or someone
that's really big and they just need

[29:00]
that's really big and they just need
more bandwidth well think of think of
the mobile home parks that that you're
partnering with right now they're not
doing this but there are companies that
go out and generate leads for mobile
home parks and then sell those leads to
people right so it's like it's not it's
different because leads are you're
buying an existing asset this is like
market research to find Opportunities to
then go and grow but it's not
necessarily novel it's not like we're
just creating something whole cloth
yeah yeah I thought about doing this I
don't know if I ever told you this but
I've got a good friend at church his
name's John he owns a like an addiction
recovery treatment center and he lives
in Allen but it's in fris it's like 35
minutes away he's doing really well he's
growing fast he wants to open a second
location in DFW so we were on a cruise
together like a year or two ago just
brewing down I'm like where are you
going to open he's like I don't know you
know like Garland or you know and he's
just kind of talking about anecdotal
stuff you know I get a lot of customers
from mckin so I was like dude you know

[30:01]
from mckin so I was like dude you know
like we could figure this out pretty
easily like what I'm like well you just
go to outs scrape you scrape it you know
run find a Baseline and he's like what I
was like let me get home get in front of
my computer I'll send you a loom he's
like what's Loom I'm like dude just
chill out Boomer are you my grandson I
went home and I it literally took about
18 minutes start to finish I loomed the
whole thing and it was very clear like
very convincing we got to the end of it
and I laid it all out on a map I'm like
here's where all your competitors are
we're not going to include these guys
cuz that's a hospital that's not your
competitor yada y y right and he was
like turns
out there's a big hole in the market in
Allen which is where you live like wow
this is really great for you and so I
sent it to him and he's like dude this
is amazing he's like what can I give you
what can I pay you I'm like no nothing
like he's like I was thinking Allan
because of all these anecdotal data
points yada yada y he's like it feels
very confirming that you're saying this
and I think like Little Elm there were a
couple other that were like two or

[31:00]
couple other that were like two or
second or third place and he's like that
makes so much sense maybe the business
would be like a competitive analysis for
companies that are thinking about
expanding yeah so it's was like man I
could have charged someone like a
thousand bucks for that and it could
have taken 20 minutes but it's like how
do you find the that John like how do
you find that guy it's a very specific
person I think too because a lot of
businesses theoretically know how to do
that they're like well in order for me
to know what the competitive landscape
looks like in my Market I'd need to know
how many competitors I have of course
that makes sense and then compare it to
the population and like they could get
there maybe most won't get there but
many of them could get there it's the
next step where it's like all right so
do I have to go to Google and like
search for it and then write them all
down and like how do I get the list
that's comprehensive enough for me to
understand whether or not all of my
competitors are in here it's that step
which using the outs scraper or
understanding the ratios of population
anyways just knowing where to pull data
I think would be an interesting business

[32:00]
I think would be an interesting business
it's a Data Business it's a market
analysis business but yeah that's
interesting I would think that the your
Prime customer would be someone just
like John that they opened one location
maybe it's a taco shop maybe it's
addiction recovery dental office
whatever and they open there because
that's where they lived right it wasn't
really strategic and it worked and
they're growing and now it's was like
where do I go next that's where they
really need help because they didn't
they never done that research before and
then you could go scrape a list of local
businesses and scrub out all the ones
that have two Plus locations and do cold
Outreach to the ones that only have one
that's just where I was going to go the
cold Outreach is to the ones that just
have one location and it would be super
easy right like you filter out scraper
by their business type or industry type
and you just say like hey here's an
industry analysis or here's a market
competitive market analysis of your
business and I don't know how you would
tease it right maybe it's like here are
here's 50% of the report but would you
be interested in knowing more about you
know how to either grow into another
Market or jum up more business for your

[33:00]
Market or jum up more business for your
Market that would be such effective cold
Outreach like you said he's seen that
for the first time and he's like holy
like there's something different about
looking at it on a map and be and
understanding like oh there's a hole in
the market here yeah right like or or
maybe maybe you send them the map and
the whole in the market is just in a
mile radius and the rest is gray
out because it's like hey if you want to
see the rest of the market in DFW let us
know we'd love to show you because maybe
they have Ambitions to go maybe they're
in fris and they want to go to grap Vine
right or maybe they're I don't even
Paris up in the middle of nowhere and
they want to come down to Dallas like
that would be a really
interesting business model it would be
yeah I wonder like what the market what
price the market would bear for a report
like that I'm sure it depends on the
industry a dentist might pay a lot more
than a restaurant
owner well and I think you'd have to
find someone who's actively thinking
about expanding that's the hard part is
you got you can't know that until you
reach out to all of them
no and and I probably wouldn't filter

[34:01]
no and and I probably wouldn't filter
out the multiple chain
locations like yeah because they could
be looking for number three or four
exactly exactly I might filter out the
franchises right like I might be like
all right Chick-fil-A McDonald's I'm not
worried about those but I'm gonna I'm
going to Target all the other Burger
chains that are in DFW that are
privately owned because those in fact
the ones who have two three locations
are probably
Prime potential customers because
they've already got a couple they're
probably looking for they proved that
they're yeah yeah I would agree maybe
two locations is a sweet spot cuz they
proved that they're already most people
don't want to expand most people will
stay at one location forever you have
two it's like all right oh dude think
about this I love this idea think about
this you do it you test you're like hey
here's the competitive landscape of your
Market oh that's cool you send it to
them they look at it and they're like oh
there's all these holes in all these
different areas what do I do with this
data it's more raw but interesting what
do I do with this data how do I it's
like hey contact us for more they
contact us and it's like hey we could

[35:01]
contact us and it's like hey we could
run a Facebook Marketplace ad for you
campaign for you we could do a keyword
search for you there's other validators
that we could run in order to show them
where holes are in the market we'll show
you how many people in Allen are
searching for addiction recovery centers
over time right they yes could they do
it themselves yeah but they just don't
know where to go and actually do those
things so it's like showing them the
opportunity but then also working them
through the rest of the analysis of
whether or not there's an opportunity
for them to
expand yeah yeah like you could have
different price points you could say
like all right we're only going to do a
location analysis or we're going to do a
keyword analysis too and location it's
like 500 800 1500 I like that what I
don't like is it's not really recurring
you got to keep chasing down these these
deals it it could be recurring if they
keep growing yeah but I I think even the
small franchises like there's a place in
DFW called Hast stack it's a burger
place but it's a franchise I feel like

[36:00]
place but it's a franchise I feel like
with physical location franchises that's
a core part of what the franchisor does
site selection absolutely it's like you
can't really get them Chick-fil-A I mean
Chick-fil-A is huge right but I'm saying
even the small franchises they're
probably not your customers either no
I'm just saying like that's one of the
core competitive advantages that they
have is they have experience and people
who are actually looking at the
competitive market analysis and saying
oh on the corner of eagle and Chinden
which where I live are X number of cars
that pass that way and this is how we do
our analysis and then they're scraping
all the rest of the demographics and
they're finding these locations
individual mom and pop shops like they
don't even have time even if they
potentially had the skill set they don't
even have time to sit down and do a
competitive analysis they don't what
data are they even supposed to pull do
they pull it all into Excel like where
do they scrape it from what's quality
data what's not quality data there's a
lot there but to your point yeah it's
not recurring it's more Project based
and I think there would like
if there was a way we could automate a
lot of it that would be helpful but it

[37:01]
lot of it that would be helpful but it
seems like it's because it's Consulting
it's very much like okay I got to go out
I got to meet with you I got to do a bid
we would have to find someone who could
do most of those things and then walk
them through the
analysis I think you could train someone
pretty easily to do it you think so like
I'm thinking about traffic counts too
like you go to the Texas do website you
can get traffic counts people aren't
going to think to do that you know like
would you rather have your restaurant on
a 10,000 count Street or a 30,000 count
Street H and and they're not thinking so
granularly as like a lot of people like
I'm going to open my burger shop here
because there are no Burger shops over
here you might want to open near other
Burger shops because that's where people
go to buy Burgers you know yeah like I
did a I did a video of this in Greece
where was like there were gelato shops
on every corner and it was like geez
I've never open a gelato shop here it's
saturated it's like no this is where you
go because this is where people go to
buy Gelato yeah this is gelato alley my
friend yeah if you want to open a top
tier barbecue restaurant you go to

[38:00]
tier barbecue restaurant you go to
Austin where all the top tier barbecue
restaurants are you don't go to
somewhere where there's no barbecue
restaurant dude that and that's really
true too the other thing they're not
even looking at the second order effects
of like okay here's the traffic count on
this street in Allen cool what's the
growth rate of Allen year overy year MH
right like Allen is growing at a
compounded 9% a year the rest of the
country is growing at 2 and a half% a
year well just by virtue of the fact of
going to Allen because it's outpacing
the growth rate of the rest of the
country there's going to be a market for
burgers because at some point the
Market's going to grow big enough where
the existing offering is not enough to
meet the Demand right so it's like okay
cool that may or may not be a quote
unquote saturated Market but where is it
going to be in five or 10 years from now
and can you position yourself to be in a
good spot especially if you have a good
brand and you have a good location and
you have good word of mouth and
association with that brand like looking

[39:01]
association with that brand like looking
out the next five or 10 years that
Brand's not going away so where else
could we move into to take advantage of
it yeah I just I was thinking back to
the B2B stump grinding idea I wonder if
the play here is to go through
commercial real estate companies that
are looking for sites for restaurants
and say hey like Outsource all your
marketing to us you can just upcharge it
to your consumer so you don't have to
eat the cost and we'll say hey only look
for a 4,000 foot restaurant in this
radius because this is where they're
most likely to be successful therefore
this is where they're most likely to
want to add a third location with you
right so you're going to give us five
grand for this report you're going to
tack that onto your fees and then you're
going to make all your money from
signing long-term leases right and then
you're you're going to be more confident
in their ability to not default on those
leases and to find success in that
market because the market analys you're
going to look really smart you could say
that you did this research we don't care
you can white label it white label it
what does it matter to us yeah and we
could send them samples of ones that
we've done in the

[40:01]
we've done in the
past I love that all right cool all
right I'll start it tomorrow
