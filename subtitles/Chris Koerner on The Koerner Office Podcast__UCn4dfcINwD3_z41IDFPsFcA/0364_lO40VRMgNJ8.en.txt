[00:00]
welcome to the Kerner office this is
Chris kerer here and it's Friday so
today is holdco Bros with my partner
Nick of the podcast Nick onomics and we
talked about four different things today
that I'm very excited about the second
half of this podcast will be next Friday
and the four ideas we talk about are
Reddit growth hack so anyone could have
and grow their own subreddit which is
very very powerful we talked about a
business in a box idea that anyone could
monetize we talked about a cool website
that tracks any changes made and how you
can make money on it and we landed on
something really really exciting dealing
with car dealerships that could be
really profitable for anyone listening
and then our fourth idea was a CPA idea
how you could piggyback on CPAs to make
money helping people save on their taxes
super good you're going to love it but
we will interrupt ourselves in the
middle of one of these segments and
continue it a week from today so please
like And subscribe share with a friend
and we'll see you next
[Music]
time what is the big social media
platform that is now publicly traded
that is full of toxicity that people

[01:00]
that is full of toxicity that people
don't really take very seriously with an
orange logo oh Trump media
Reddit dude dude Reddit is so freaking
toxic it's so toxic honestly and this
surprise me Reddit most toxic you know
what the second threads threads threads
is the freaking worst it's the worst I
thought it was Twitter it's not Twitter
it's threads there's some angry cat moms
over there that's true and don't mess
with cats okay all right Reddit go
anyway so I've got all these platforms
where I publish my content and I've I've
got like an I call it a EO strategy
everything everywhere all at once okay
that's true so if I put out a banger
tweet I want that repurpose everywhere
okay but I'm not putting on Reddit
because reddit's different right you got
to put it in subreddits and if you do
people are going to downvote you they're
going to call you stupid and it hurts my
feelings okay it it genuinely does yeah
yeah and so so I was I was thinking I

[02:01]
yeah and so so I was I was thinking I
was like all right you can't really grow
a Reddit account I have an aged Reddit
account I have 40 Reddit Gold which is a
lot and the algorithm likes me when I
post a Reddit because I have so much
Karma but you don't really grow Reddit
accounts you can follow a Reddit account
but people don't really do that right
you you follow subreddits you grow
subreddits right you with me yeah
totally it's it's a different Dynamic
right like other social platforms it's
about the person on Reddit it's about
the topic exactly and so I've posted in
the entrepreneurship subreddit the side
hustle subreddit bunch of times and
they've done well but it doesn't really
get you anything it can't even really
get you clicks because as soon as you
add a link they'll delete your post most
times unless you find some sneaky ways
around it which is another podcast for
another day so I thought I need my own
subreddit and this just needs to be a
place where I just publish my content
and I'm the I'm the the judge and the
jury and the Executioner and I control

[03:00]
jury and the Executioner and I control
what goes in what comes out and I can
put in whatever links I want right yeah
so then I start going down this rabbit
hole and it's like well how do you
create like okay anyone can create a
subreddit how do you grow it because you
just post in there it's just you it
doesn't go anywhere unless people start
crossposting it you have to already have
members it's a big catch22 then those
members have to share it either
externally to other platforms where
people see it and then they happen to
join your subreddit or you can cross
post it to other subreddits which is
tricky because many subreddits if not
most of them don't even allow
crossposting so what I would do in this
case I would take my long tweet about
how to start a tree tring business I
would post it in my subreddit and then I
would go cross poost it to the Home
Service subreddit the sweaty starter
subreddit yada yada y all the tangential
subreddits but even if a subreddit does
allow for crossposting the cross post
don't do as well it's like retweeting a
retweet doesn't do nearly as well as the
original TW tweet right yeah and I know

[04:02]
original TW tweet right yeah and I know
this for a fact because I've posted the
same thing originally in a subreddit and
then crossposted to another subreddit
and it gets 2% of the views I had to get
creative and what do we do when we have
constraints Nick we get creative yes
okay so I created a subreddit called Biz
ideas B ideas one word there's already a
business ideas there's already a
business underscore ideas and so this
isn't anything new but that's something
I talk about a lot so I created a
business ideas one person in there me
I'm the only moderator only person so
then I start repurposing a bunch of my
old Twitter content and I start
crossposting it and it does okay and I
get you know 5 10 20 30 40 people to
join my subreddit which is cool
especially because they don't know who I
am they just like the content and they
joined but you you know you've got kind
of a low ceiling on that so I think okay
how can I get AI involved how can I get
zapier involved Okay so so here's where

[05:00]
zapier involved Okay so so here's where
it gets
interesting okay you ready Chris what's
up you had my
interest but now you have my
attention no you don't have my interest
but now you have my
respect all right so there are limits
with reddits API they don't want you
they don't want the API permissions to
be able to post comments so that has to
be done manually but will read comments
and you can use AI to respond to
comments you just can't post them unless
you do it manually so here's what I did
I went to zapier and I had it search for
every time something was posted in any
subreddit worldwide with the word idea
in the title not business idea but just
idea okay okay okay and then I had it
fil I had it filter out all of the posts
that were media only because AI can't

[06:00]
that were media only because AI can't
understand that in the way that I want
it to right some some people say wow
this looks like a bad idea and then they
put in a video of something crazy
happening that doesn't apply and so if
there's only media filter it out if it
was posted the filter says if it was
posted in the last 30 minutes and it
already has at least four up votes then
only then which only applies about 10%
of the time write a comment that says
this huh what a interesting idea but you
know what any good idea could be a good
business idea here's how i' turn this
into a business and then AI comes up
with whatever right sometimes it's
pretty smart sometimes it's not and then
at the end of it there's a line break
and it says TBH all lowercase I have it
put in misspellings I have it put do all
lowercase it really doesn't look like AI
it really doesn't Okay and then the last
sentence is like TBH this post is
probably a better fit for rbiz ideas

[07:02]
probably a better fit for rbiz ideas
which is a direct hyperlink to my
subreddit yeah okay so instead of
controlling the posts I'm in the
comments and I'm only piggybacking on
posts that are growing popularity really
quickly I'm filtering out everything
else and so tens or hundreds of times a
day I'm posting comments in all these
random subreddits with the smart
sounding business idea linking back to
my subreddit is it working yeah
it's
working I've got like two 200 and
something members in there and I've only
posted like nine comments all right
here's my question I love it like for
what like why are you why are you
growing a sub
brother you're a dictator who's like I
only want kind words around me so you
speak if it's
flattery no if that were the case I
wouldn't post on threads or really
anywhere because here's the thing you
get want to join your subreddit you can

[08:01]
get want to join your subreddit you can
send them a welcome message with as many
hyperlinks as you want here's my
newsletter here's XYZ that that ends up
in their inbox so that's cool second of
all I can pin any post I want I can
highlight it I can pin it I can post all
of my content with as many links as I
want and like the algorithm doesn't mind
like the only people that mind on Reddit
that these things happen are the
moderators and I'm the only moderator so
I get a bunch of strangers in there that
have no idea who I am thousands or tens
of thousands or hundreds of thousands
and then I can just start repurposing
all of my content with links to my
newsletter and get it's just another
Channel my question was misunderstood I
I get why you're doing it right like Hey
we're trying to grow an audience social
media but like if I'm just listening I'm
an entrepreneur like okay cool you told
me a growth hack to grow Reddit like
what does that do what does that do for
a just typical
entrepreneur give me an example of
someone that just owns like a regular
business and I'll apply it to that let's

[09:00]
business and I'll apply it to that let's
say somebody who has a digital marketing
agency perfect example you softball me
love it I didn't mean to all right so
let's say I could set up a zapier I
could create a subreddit called we're
not just going to do digital marketing
we're going to go more Niche than that
we're going to say Google business
profile Google business profile agencies
G GBP agency rgbp agency okay owner
owners or whatever and then I'm going to
set up a zap that searches for anything
that says SEO sem marketing email Mark
I'm going to go Niche I'm going to go
broad all along the marketing Spectrum
content marketing anything doesn't take
very long to set up all these triggers
and then I'm gonna I'm going to use open
AI API to say um to basically take a
post about anything marketing and apply
it to Google business profile right so
I'll say somehow take this post and say

[10:00]
I'll say somehow take this post and say
you know what like yeah SEO is great but
most people that have digital marketing
agencies don't have a physical presence
so they don't think that Google business
profile is relevant to them but it
actually is here's why here's the three
reasons why it's relevant it's like
honestly like I learned this from
rgbp agency owners right and so you
could just leave comments there
everywhere maybe it's not owners but
it's like business owners where it
depends do you want do you want to sell
something to agency owners or do you
want to sell your services to business
owners your GBP this strategy would be
geared towards somebody who already
believes in the power of social
media to to essentially Market or
identify customers and it's just another
channel for them to go out and find
people who are interested in their
services is that fair yeah yeah it's a
it's a it's an untapped marketing
channel what people don't know I don't
know how much we've talked about this
but like one of the things that I've
always admired about you is your ability
to leverage underutilized marketing
channels

[11:00]
channels
Reddit is one of those so you've been
writing on Reddit for years and you
really cut your teeth on Reddit Nick
Huber was the same way right like he
started writing on Reddit and then it
translated really well to social media
Huber's terrible on camera you are not
so I think you have a much higher ceing
than he does but like your ability to
write copy is incredibly important in
growing businesses so while Reddit sucks
I do think it's a really good testing
ground for ideas to go out and test and
we've launched several businesses tested
several IDE gotten lots of leads off of
Reddit in non-traditional ways this
feels like a much more scalable way to
get leads off of Reddit whereas in the
past like you're saying you had yeah not
only did you go have to find a subreddit
that was perfect for that type of
business you then had to write a post
that went viral whereas if you own the
subreddit you can control the
information and people are coming like
you're you're tracking the right type of
people and your content will play even
better it's true Did you know that the
sweaty startup subred has like over
200,000 people in it
it's owned by Huber yeah it's like a

[12:01]
it's owned by Huber yeah it's like a
really popular one yeah that makes sense
he figured this out years ago yeah but
he doesn't really use it much and maybe
that's for a reason that I haven't
learned yet right couple cool things so
I posted my tree business long form
thread from a year ago in the business
uncore ideas subreddit which has a
couple hundred thousand people in it
okay and it did really well it got
600,000 views but early on one of the
commenters like you're just ripping off
Chris kerer you're just this you're just
copy pasting Chris Kerner and my my name
on Reddit is not my name it's an
anonymous name so I was like and so they
deleted it and I was like guys I am him
I am him like I promise like I'll verify
it any way you want and then the
moderator luckily like the main
moderator was like oh you are oh my gosh
Chris kerer is is in our subreddit so he
made it live again and then I dm'd him
and I thanked him and I was like hey I'd
really love to start syndicating my
content in here but you don't allow
links like can we work out a deal
because like thousands of people shared

[13:02]
because like thousands of people shared
this post in other subreddits which grew
your channel and theoretically thousands
of people could click which would grow
my channel like is there some symbiotic
relationship we could work out here and
he was like hey I'll tell you what you
can post whatever you want in here once
a week with a link to whatever you want
and we won't delete it so I was like
first of all that's awesome second of
all what a cool model it's like a it's
like a radio syndication right it's like
a you scratch my back I scratch yours we
eat kind of grow each other but I don't
know if anyone really doing that on
Reddit so that's something else I love
these ideas like to to take it political
if you look at the last election that we
just had the Democrats spent something
like they had like a billion dollars
that they could spend on President
Harris's election campaign and they
ended up going $20 million in debt so
they they not only spent the billion but
they went into debt I want to say the
Trump team spent like somewhere in the
ballpark of like $300 million but the
Harris campaign spent on traditional
media they had Beyonce come out they had

[14:01]
media they had Beyonce come out they had
celebrities come out they went on all
the shows they bought advertising like
it they it it's almost like the
difference between a well-funded startup
and a scrappy startup you know what I
mean like they just have constraints
they got to get creative right and so
Trump and he did this in the first two
times that he ran he has a lot of earned
media because he's just a personality so
if he goes on anything people are going
to tune into it but he did the the
podcast circuit and she did call her
daddy but it didn't really get good
ratings but he did Joe Rogan he did um I
can't remember the name of the other
comedian who has a show but he he did
these shows and he reached the audience
that ended up kind of getting him the
election which were young men like that
kind of swamp that was a big difference
maker and I'm not like making a judgment
on right right one way or the other but
I've now been listening to political
commentary that are like all right if
you are watching this clip right now you
are watching this on YouTube and if you
are a fan of podcast please check out my
podcast while you're at it because
sometimes I have podcasts that aren't on
YouTube and sometimes I have YouTubes
that aren't on podcast so check out the

[15:01]
that aren't on podcast so check out the
ker office on any podcast platform or
you can go to TKO pod.com also my
newsletter will throw that in there
there are no ads It's weekly it's
different content than my podcast and
YouTube newsletter. chrisj cerner.com
You'll see the link and we'll see you
there like this election was decided by
podcasts and you're going to see a
massive shift in spending in podcasts in
non-traditional media because
traditional media is not reaching people
in the same ways that it used to so this
to me is an an example of going to
Reddit and finding a way to reach people
that is creative that will probably
there will be an Arbitrage here right
like if you can move in early you're
going to see an outsized return on that
it was JD Vance was on Theo Von's
podcast I think that's what you were
talking I know JD Vance was on Theo
Von's podcast but then Trump went on I
can't remember his name he's the guy
with dark hair has a
mustache I don't know anyways he's a
comedian as well but well and then I
mean then Rogan endorsed him the night
before the election that doesn't hurt
did you see that no it doesn't it
doesn't hurt at all the weird thing is

[16:01]
doesn't hurt at all the weird thing is
that like K Harris wouldn't go to Joe
Rogan right right again maybe out of
Pride or I think it was a little bit of
Pride but like Trump did Trump went and
kissed the ring and he reached the
audience that he needed to reach in
order to win the election my personal
opinion is K is not great in those
interview Styles right she doesn't have
good interviews Trump does like Trump is
charismatic and you you like him whereas
kamla isn't that and that's what's
interesting about presidential elections
it seems like the candidate who's best
on camera win every time the charismatic
the guy with the RZ you gota have RZ
like Joe Biden beat Trump but that was
just because there was a huge back like
that would be the only case in the last
30 years that I would say it's an
outlier it doesn't work but actually
there's one more So Reagan way better on
cam JFK when he won way better on camera
but Reagan better on camera then you
have George HW Bush not better on camera

[17:00]
have George HW Bush not better on camera
but he's kind of a continuation of
Ronald Reagan Bill Clinton better on
camera George W bush versus Al Gore I
mean come on way better on camera versus
John krey way better on camera Barack
Obama versus John McCain way better on
camera Donald Trump Hillary Clinton
Donald Trump way better on camera so
it's like if you're more charismatic
you're going to win the presidency I
don't know that that's the best way to
elect the president you know what I mean
but I think he like he knew that and
it's it's the same with marketing if you
can figure out a way to reach people
that aren't being reached by traditional
media there's an Arbitrage there that
you can play and this Reddit idea is
perfect for that and I think what why
the Reddit idea works is because back to
politics generally speaking the
moderators of these subreddits lean very
Left Right which you could argue is very
anti- capitalist therefore like no links
in here no promotion in here nothing so
if you can find a way to be the
moderator of your own little kingdom and
put as many links in there as you want
you could still capture the audience
that is hundreds of millions of daily

[18:00]
that is hundreds of millions of daily
active users without having to have
links be suppressed I think it's a
freaking great idea look at look at the
top 10 media podcasts news media
podcasts eight of the top 10 are
conservative two of the top 10 are
liberal and like they're both by the
same woman Caris Wisher on with Caris
Wisher and pivot the the rest are Ben
Shapiro and Mark Levin and Charlie Kirk
and all these other guys but it's
because traditional media has like left
this hole where you know those
conservatives don't feel like they're
being spoken to so they've got to go and
create their own media platforms it's
probably going to be the same way in
Reddit right like you have all of these
subreddits that are just so tightly
controlled by people that if you get
somebody like you or Huber and you
create your own subreddit it's going to
be popular just because of the novelty
like it's it's just different it's
swimming in in a different direction
side I like that idea d one more idea to
grow a subreddit that anyone could use
you ready so it's pretty common for
people to launch podcasts just interview
podcasts right and it's not too
difficult to find people to interview

[19:02]
difficult to find people to interview
that are like more have a a bigger
presence than you right there are a lot
of like bigname people on podcasts that
you've never heard of okay yeah yeah
another way to grow a subreddit is to
kind of take the same angle but find
those people to do amas ask me anything
inside your brand new subreddit so like
to grow my subreddit I'm going to do an
AMA one day I'm going to push it out to
all of my channels and I'm going to host
it in my subreddit so you go in there
and like you you don't have to join to
participate but you probably will or I
could make the permissions in the subred
to if you comment you have to be a
member of the subreddit so technically
you can't does that make sense dude yeah
it makes sense that would be an
interesting way to grow our podcast
think about growing like having okay an
economic subreddit or the ker office
subreddit and you post WE Post every
episode and that's just the Forum where
people can go and comment on it right
and have interactions like oh I didn't
like this I like that and then you set
up you're doing with zapier I had Zack

[20:00]
up you're doing with zapier I had Zack
Prince on it's like all right every post
on Reddit that mentioned Zack Prince
whatever you got to send set up an if
then statement but we have a comment and
it points us back to his
interview idea onomics right like and
then they like they subscribe they they
listen and you're getting a community of
people the flip side is it can get
really toxic really quick now if you
control the subreddit then you can kick
people out but that would be a really
freaking that potentially could be an
exceptional growth hack for podcasting
anyways the problem with Reddit is
you've spent so many years on Reddit so
it's like you got to catch people up to
help them understand why it's a good
idea so you had to do that all right
cool yeah Chris I got I got some cool
ideas do you want to listen to Silver
tsunami idea business in a box idea CPA
idea business in box okay so that's
funny I should have known you were gonna
do that I know that this already exists
okay but hear me out I think there needs
to be a DIY service for side Hustlers

[21:00]
to be a DIY service for side Hustlers
and you've started businesses I've
started businesses you've started way
more businesses than I've started from
scratch it's a freaking nightmare to get
your books cleaned up it's a freaking
nightmare to know where you are relative
to where you thought you would be what's
your Revenue what's your cost per unit
you know what are your gross margins
like you don't know any of that stuff
early on you're just going and you
you're trying to look for little signals
so that you know whether or not you're
moving in the right direction but it's
it's hard to get those kis and even if
you wanted to start getting those kpis
it's like all right I need a CRM but do
I need HubSpot like do I need to pay or
do I need Salesforce do I need to be
paying $1,000 a month for this stuff
okay I need accounting but do I need
QuickBooks I need to incorporate but do
I need to go to Legal Zoom do I need to
have an attorney like there's just all
of these kind of things that you go
through as a business owner when you're
getting up and start up and running but
people like you and I have growth tactic
and we kind of have a tech stack that we
use now right it's like okay we kind of

[22:01]
use now right it's like okay we kind of
use Google Sheets until we get to a
certain level and then we we kind of
professionalize it so I think that
there's an opportunity for someone to
create a business in a box that says
basically here are the tools that you
need to get started and then here are
the Integrations that you need to create
go for people who are trying to do side
hustles so like accounting bank accounts
Finance invoicing software all of those
things cool here's stripe here here's uh
Google Sheets here's the zapier API or
integration that you need to have that's
pulling from those things here's how you
can set it up so you can look metrics
great operations this is how you're
tracking customers you can't afford
HubSpot but set up your Google Sheets
this way so that you're getting customer
information like this inventory
management okay you're not ready for an
inventory management system this is how
you should set up Google Sheets in order
to get this stuff going so oh you need
you're finally ready to incorporate this

[23:00]
you're finally ready to incorporate this
is what you should do don't go to an
attorney yet go to these websites
incorporate this is how you start the
bank account Etc it's like very easy
like anybody could create it using chat
GPT but you would go and look at the
things that typical businesses use and
then create this business in a box
because entrepreneurship is only
becoming more popular people are only
getting more and more interested in
doing side hustles but the the headache
of getting stuff cleaned up of having
clean books of understanding where your
metrics are is just such a problem that
you kind of have to figure it out
yourself it'd be nice to just have a
plug-in BL system that says you're
getting started use this what does it
look like like is it is it a website is
it an app where is it hosted what I
would do so this is what I would go I it
would be like a digital product that you
could sell and it would be a spreadsheet
with a Google doc that's it and so the
Google Doc would sort of lay out all
right here are the here are the five
areas of your business finance and it
would go through all invoicing
accounting Revenue right and then
there'd be links to here the
spreadsheets that you should use how to
set them up and then there would be

[24:01]
set them up and then there would be
operations cool this is how you set up
your internal CRM right and then Links
of how to set it up so like it would
take a while to set up like we'd have to
actually go through it and create it but
once it was created it would just it
would be a very cheap version of kind of
setting up your backend systems it's so
funny you bring this up because I've had
over the last week I've had a very
similar idea I wasn't calling it this
and it doesn't look like that but
achieves the same purpose and it solves
the same
problem this it's just really funny
because this is something else I've been
excited about before I go there so how
is it customized to whatever Niche or or
industry that person is doing or is it
broad enough to where it applies to
basically anyone I think you can upsell
those things right like if you were
trying to make more money off of it but
it would just be broad we would say that
in the disclaimers like look you're
going to have to tailor this but these
are the systems that you could use
you're going to have to tailor anything
if you bought QuickBook you're going to
have to tailor it if you bought a
HubSpot you're going to have to tailor

[25:00]
HubSpot you're going to have to tailor
it if you bought jobber like any of
these other systems you're going to have
to tailor it right so it'd be the same
as any of those other systems it's funny
because it it reminds me of this who was
it someone in my family my aunt or
something she always says you know I I
might have screwed up at raising my kids
but I they don't make a book about this
like how to parent 101 it's kind of like
that it's like a business version of
that like how to business okay love it
definitely solving a problem here's what
I was thinking
the New Year's coming A lot of people
are going to have a New Year's
resolution to start a business right or
a side hustle right the problem that you
outline absolutely exists how to
incorporate where to incorporate which
one to choose do I even incorporate do I
need a customer first do I need a
business plan first I hear Chris talks
about this Nick talks about this Alex
horos talks about this like what do I do
where do I start I thought about doing
like an 8 to 12 week email-based cohort
like a course okay but every Monday that
email is going to show up
and it's it's an email with instructions

[26:01]
and it's it's an email with instructions
like a to-do list but it's also an
accountability partner and then on
Sunday you get another email for
followup with a form to fill out saying
like here's what I did I found my first
customer this week I I got a logo this
week I got a website this week and there
is a cost to it let's say it's $200 $400
for the whole thing starts on January
first but every week you fill out the
the type form or whatever it is and say
I did all my steps you get a re you get
refunded a proportional amount so by the
end of it if you do everything you're
supposed to
do and you that means you actually have
a business with paying customers and as
a cherry on top you didn't pay anything
for any of that you get a full refund H
but statistically speaking most people
would not do most of it they would flame
out after a couple weeks so it could
still be a profitable business while
still earning the Goodwill of doing it
for free because if if you do what you
say you're going to do it's free if you
don't you pay so you know who Jason

[27:03]
don't you pay so you know who Jason
calanis is on oh yeah it's yeah so he he
he has an accelerator incubator I can't
remember exactly what it's called but
it's founder University I think it's I
think is the name of it founder
University and it costs money but if you
complete it you get a full refund yeah
because his thing is like hey I want you
to have skin in the game it's and it's
kind of like that right but he yeah he's
not really doing it to make money he's
trying to get people into his ecosystem
Etc
would you make money off of this or are
you just like that would be a
cool thing it would be it would be a
cool thing to do and it would make money
yeah because a certain percentage of
them are not and it's not all or nothing
right you may get 50% of the way done
and that's interesting you and I think
people should be rewarded for doing some
of it and not necessarily all of it you
know yeah I don't know I don't know it
would I would think it would be in the
hundreds I think that's a freaking great
idea
yeah and the for me the business in the

[28:01]
yeah and the for me the business in the
Box thing would be probably building out
some programmatic
SEO around like what should I use to you
know start my business oh that's a great
idea that's a great idea when should I
incorporate like all those Google terms
and and I'm sure that there are like
other high ranking things but it would
just be hey here's like the
$50 packet D DIY like do-it-yourself
business in a box and then it it would
just literally just be passive you
create it one time and it's just
spitting out based on programmatic SEO
this is just such a perfect example of
how
like the distribution
idea can make the business idea a
thousand times better because I think
programmatic SEO would be just the most
brilliant way to build that business
because of all of the Endless
combinations of words and sentences how
do I incorporate my barber business
business tree care business HVAC
business Plumb M just for that one just
incorporate you have thousands of

[29:01]
incorporate you have thousands of
landing pages thousands of Search terms
that people are how do I find customers
for my thousand like how do I you have
thousands of questions that people are
searching for and then thousands so
theoretically you have millions of
landing pages answering questions that
people are asking that could all have a
link to a paid product what's been
really fun about the last like six
months is this was a whole world that I
didn't know and I'm still like way
behind where you are but it's fun to
have these conversations now where I'm
like somewhat understanding some of the
distribution and growth hack portions of
it because then like I can actually add
value where whereas before it was just
like that sounds like a cool idea but
the distribution piece like you said is
like so important to understand like how
okay cool great idea how you gonna get
it out there yeah oh oh man that's
really good I like that a lot oh Chris
all right you're up I want you to give
me some ideas I'm going to plant you
with an idea and I want you to give me
some some implementation ideas Hit Me

[30:00]
some some implementation ideas Hit Me
With Your
Best so I found a website that's really
really interesting and I want to
monetize it somehow but I'm I'm coming
up short okay is it called Wikipedia no
it's called distill D distill
doio and what distill does I'm going to
pull it
up it notifies you if something on a
website
changes okay H now you can tell by the
way they're pushing uh their website
that most people use it for ticket sales
okay so as a family we are going to the
Alabama Auburn game at the end of the
month the ironbowl and I'm cheap I don't
want to buy tickets when they're 200
bucks each I want to buy them when
they're 100 bucks each but when are
tickets the cheapest now if it's a
concert ticket statistically speaking
you're better off waiting until the last
minute but with sports tickets it can it
can range like Auburn if if they're
ranked in two weeks they're going to be
more expensive if Alabama loses the next

[31:00]
more expensive if Alabama loses the next
two weeks they're going to be cheaper
right you just you can't really know you
don't know when the best time is to buy
them and Ticket Master and StubHub and
all those guys they don't really have
services for this because they that
doesn't work to their incentivization
they want you to buy right now and
that's why they're they're always going
to tell you going fast price will be
higher tomorrow right and so you can use
distill the io to notify to be notified
when a ticket price drops for any event
for any section for any seat super cool
it's a little unintuitive to use like it
it's kind of tricky to use but I think
there's a world where you could build a
SAS on top of this where you you could
just build like a ticket notification
system that's built on top of distilla
IO and it's stupid simple easy to use
maybe it only works on Ticket Master
only works on StubHub it's $10 a year or
something cheap have you heard of Scots
cheap flights mhm it's kind of like that
it's like 70 bucks a year and it's kind
of an insurance policy you're like I

[32:00]
of an insurance policy you're like I
don't know how many times I'm going to
travel this year but if I get an email
and it says the flights to Hawaii are
300 bucks right now we're going to go to
Hawaii and I'm going to pay 70 bucks a
year just for the opportunity to save
you know $1,000 on tickets it could be
something like that like tens of dollars
a year for a service but more broadly
speaking how could you use this to make
money who's using to steal the io right
now like who are they they have to be a
company right yeah I'm sure that they
have like a Target demograph trffic or
Target that's what I was saying is like
it their the messaging on their website
is like towards the ticket ticketing
websites take ticketing out of it why
would I care if a website updated here's
the problem if I cared enough for an
website like an update on on a website
changing I'm probably going to be on
their emails list I'm probably gonna
already be in like let's say it's a food
product that just
dropped or it's a it's a new uh blog

[33:00]
dropped or it's a it's a new uh blog
article that that Chris posts right like
I'm going to be on his email on his
email list so it has to be something
where you're interested enough to want
to know about it but not so interest
like or there's not a mechanism to
update people via a
newsletter yeah I'll give you some ideas
so let's say it's a Shopify site okay
come back next Friday for part two and
you know what please leave me a five
star review while you're at it because I
need some more of those love you guys
