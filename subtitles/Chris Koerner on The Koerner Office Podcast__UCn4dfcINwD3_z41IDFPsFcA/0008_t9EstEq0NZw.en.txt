[00:00]
so I've got a sort of a specific
tactical question related to a B2B
service and um very briefly the
situation is that I work with um online
typically online publishing companies so
companies that publish magazines and
such uh a lot of it's like specific
trade Publications so print but also
online
and um deals are closed on the
phone the work is performed uh performed
virtually so to speak and so my highly
specific question here is what do you
recommend if anything for invoicing and
collecting payments really to make it
easy for the customer and for
me is it recurring at all or is it
onetime invoicing it can be
um no okay yes I was going to answer too

[01:02]
um no okay yes I was going to answer too
quickly not typically recurring um there
can be repeat customers uh but but
generally would be a one time once once
at a time who do you use as your payment
processor for like credit card
payments well I haven't uh I haven't
done it that way yet I've so I've I've
uh I've done this in a very manual old
fashion way because I I haven't jumped
to anything so I've um you know I've
accepted like I've provided Bank
information for people to send me
payments but I'm looking to expand to
use a processor too okay so if I were
you I would do one of two things so you
can use stripe for your payment
processing which is great because it has
all the recurring you know features that
you need but it's expensive um so if you
want the simple way but a little more
expensive then you stripe if you want
something that's a little more headache
and setup on the front end but is
cheaper then then I would use

[02:00]
cheaper then then I would use
authorized.net with something like I
think it's
honeybook um so it's not just going to
be authorized on that you're going to
need a payment processor as well I don't
I don't remember the name of the site
but there's a couple sites out there
that will shop around for you uh what
what you want is interchange Plus
pricing um so stripe and Shopify and all
the big guys they don't like that
because interchange Plus means you
basically don't pay anything for debit
cards maybe a tenth of a percent uh but
you will pay two to three plus percent
for AMX but most people use non AMX or
debit cards and so strip makes a ton of
money um when people pay you with a
debit card and then they make just a
little bit when they use AMX or credit
card um so I would definitely suggest
using authorized.net which is like the
Gateway for your processor and then
finding a processor that will do
interchange Plus pricing and shoot for a
quarter of a percent or less interchange
Plus just means like cost like the

[03:01]
Plus just means like cost like the
non-negotiable cost that they can't even
get down plus a a fraction of a percent
for their gross profit okay that makes
sense and um just to to clarify one
thing I don't know if this would change
your answer I did include this
information in what I sent to Heath so
you may have already factored it in but
I um I'm not taking orders on a
website so very old-fashioned way of
doing business I understand but does
that change your answer at all no I just
think you should integrate some some
form of a website like use card C A rrd
yeah um they have like a payment widget
I like or even PayPal but PayPal's going
to charge their own flat fees which are
comparable to Stripes it's not cheap um
so honestly I would go to upwork and
just post a job for exactly what you
need like I just need a simple website
interface where I can send people a link
to an invite an invoice you might not
even need a website if you use something

[04:00]
even need a website if you use something
like honeybook um you'll just kind of
use the software to send them a link and
then that link will include a way for
them to pay that's linked to your
payment processor through authorized D
that it's kind of a mouthful but that's
what I would do not a mouthful that's
super helpful I will look at that first
I'm not at the point where I'm running
ads or doing any of the stuff that I
hear a lot of people doing so I'm I'm
starting with without a site so maybe
that's a good way to uh to do it at
first but I I like your idea of card too
so I'll keep that in my back pocket
awesome well glad I could help thank you
so much yep have a good day peace thank
you all right Heath are you
there let's see looks like he got
disconnected

[05:00]
disconnected
all right there you are
Heath all right sorry kicked me out of
the hosting Cory Corey's up next he was
with us last week but we couldn't get to
him I'm still working on the other folk
so Corey you're up Hey Heath hey Chris
can you guys hear me okay yeah it's
perfect awesome I um just want to say
that last week's call was awesome even
though I didn't get to talk I got so
much out of it um I remember you you
mentioned something about card last week
and I ended up using that and set up a
quick website uh for my business as well
um so I already started implementing
what you mentioned um a little bit about
me I am the son of an entrepreneur my my
my parents are in real estate um I know
you guys do mobile home parks my family
has done self storage and and single
family homes um I'm studying Finance
right now at University in Michigan and

[06:02]
right now at University in Michigan and
um I'm looking to do something a little
bit outside of
my family business
um um about three or four months ago and
uh that's what I wanted to get a little
bit of advice for right now so we are
running a cold email agency that uh
connects uh Staffing and recruiting
companies with uh businesses that need
very special
Talent um we have a a pretty good system
set up um we started our first campaign
last week and we got three booked
meetings in the first uh day which was
amazing I'm I'm so blessed and so
grateful for that and I think that that
was a little bit of a fluke we have not
had that much uh success continued so
far but the reason for my question uh
today was I just wanted to get your
input

[07:00]
input
might something like that um uh we're
targeting uh Staffing recruiting
companies with specialized Talent we
want to connect them with with
businesses that might benefit from that
okay so you did break up a couple times
there during critical points so do you
are you running a cold email campaign
for your agency or you have a cold email
Agency for
Staffing uh so it's both uh the cold
email is both my method of collecting my
clients and my method of connecting my
clients with with other companies okay
and what exactly do you
sell um so we've got a couple different
ideas right now so the the first thing
that we're running with is connecting a
staffing and recruiting agency um with a
company that would need specialized
Talent um so for example we talk to a
couple different businesses um they
do uh like they find people who have
very Niche uh knowledge in in law for

[08:00]
very Niche uh knowledge in in law for
example or or you know in the medical
field um so connecting the recruiter
that would be our client with a company
that they can fill a space for okay and
then what is your Revenue
model well that's that's something we we
haven't got to yet we have made an idea
for that um but you know we haven't
haven't sold anything yet um what we're
thinking is a flat fee for setup you
know we're thinking something very cheap
to start off
$500 uh for the first month as like an
onboarding and a technology fee to set
up that campaigns and then a price per
book meeting um so we're thinking 500
bucks for the setup and everything and
then 300 bucks per um per meeting set up
with a a client okay so it's a cold
email agency targeted at recruiting and
staffing companies you're helping them
find customers with cold email right
correct and your corre did your question
revolve around pricing or strategy I

[09:00]
revolve around pricing or strategy I
can't remember what your exact question
was you know what the question was
trying to figure out who might benefit
best from that um I'm thinking that like
like targeting a law firm um is an okay
idea I'm just curious if you had any any
ideas about other companies that could
benefit from very specialized Talent
what made you choose this industry is
this is this what your background
is uh it's not my parents are in real
estate they um do Self Storage um I
wanted do something a little bit outside
of that uh I can always come back and
work at the family business but I wanted
to take my stab at something new uh the
reason I chose Staffing and recruiting
is because I uh had a a phone call with
someone from my local area who um is
doing a very similar business model that
I I met um on Twitter and he mentioned
casually hey you should reach out to uh
Staffing and recruiting companies uh
because you know specialized labor is
something since Co has been uh a little

[10:00]
something since Co has been uh a little
bit harder to find and he told me that
they make crazy money I've talked to two
or three different companies who do
Staffing and recruiting and um one lady
said that uh between 15 and 20% of their
first year salary which you know can be
like 5050 to 100 grand um as a
commission for them so we wanted
something High ticket something um
that's going to be you know valuable to
the customer um that we connect with
that business okay all right got it so I
love the idea
um I love that you love that it's high
ticket I if I were you the only way to
truly know what vertical to attack is to
start in batches of five I I love the
legal industry um do you know
specifically if you have any competitors
doing this in a specific um vertical
already with success or are you just
kind of taking a stab at that legal well
I know that the mechanism works I know
that reaching cold email uh using cold
email as a mechanism to reach staffing

[11:00]
email as a mechanism to reach staffing
agencies works and I know that using it
to connect the two businesses book
meetings would work um I I don't know
specifically the the legal aspect of I'm
not sure about that okay so have you
named the business
already um yeah but it's it's always
subject to change okay so always subject
to change if I were you I would name it
something broad right um and start with
five different Industries and I would do
a campaign of a what what are you using
for your software for your cold emailing
software um right now we're using smart
leads for the sending software we use
Microsoft for the the email um accounts
and then we use list kit in order to get
the leads okay I would start with five
Industries 200 emails per day um so a
thousand emails per day across all five
Industries keep the offer keep
everything the exact same right and in
each email you're going to plug in
like we specialize only in finding

[12:02]
like we specialize only in finding
talent for the blank industry like the
email will be exactly the same except
for the industry that you're naming keep
the subject lines the same keep
everything the exact same and run all
five campaigns concurrently for at least
two weeks so if we're looking at you
know 10 business days across two weeks a
th000 emails per day you're going to
have a really good sample size after two
weeks and then just put the numbers side
by side and you've got to be careful
because your open rate like a higher
open rate does not equal a higher click
rate or a higher response rate and so
what we found is a lot of times the
lowest open rates correlate directly
with a higher response rate um and or a
higher response rate will will correlate
directly with a lower like lead rate or
whatever you call it conversion rate or
you know appointment rate it it's like
you don't want to be fooled by the
metrics and say wow this oh this

[13:00]
metrics and say wow this oh this
campaign has a 62% open rate because
like who is actually getting to a phone
call and how many of those phone calls
are actually getting to a sale and
you're not going to know that for at
least two weeks um so don't don't be
fooled by the vanity metrics like open
rate and even response rate or even uh
like appointment set rate but how many
people after two weeks time are willing
to actually send you money to for your
services um and then
just it depends on on like what your
preferences are if if you really want to
hone it down then pick a 100 Industries
and do this for six months right but if
you're happy after two weeks with the
industry that you found maybe it's HVAC
maybe it's legal maybe it's something
you haven't even anticipated yet then
just go go with that rename your website
like I would rename your website
something specific to the industry um
and then change your Outreach to say
something like we only
like find placements for the X industry

[14:02]
like find placements for the X industry
like that's all that we do we know you
get emailed every day we are different
and here's why like we know this
industry inside and out we know what
your paining points are we know what
your Bot necks are going to be um but
you you just won't like no one can
answer that question better than data
and you've got to figure that
out that's awesome um okay I'll start
I'll start the split test U that was
really interesting I know you know like
testing different um like like different
body copy for the email but I didn't
think about split testing across
Industries so um I'll definitely go and
apply that I I really appreciate your
time and your Insight Chris yeah good
luck
manol thanks all right thanks Corey um
little open up to any other uh listeners
now if you want to ask Chris an advice
just hit the request to speak and we'll
do it uh we'll pull you in and get you
any advice from Chris has for
you so I'll just watch for any of those

[15:00]
you so I'll just watch for any of those
requests oh here we go we got
oh Cameron asked but then he
dropped how about Heath while we wait
for people I've got this one question
via email um sure I'm GNA do about the
espresso catering business so this guy
at def says I work for an espresso
catering business we travel around to
office offices and schools that want to
do Employee Appreciation the owner has
run it for 32 years is looking to retire
and has expressed expressed interest in
selling the quality of service is middle
of the road there are others that do the
same with higher quality product and
better marketing I like the honesty
there but he has great Word of Mouth
business and plenty of clients he has
mentioned dozens to multiple dozens but
I have not confirmed this he charges
about $400 to go to a school and serve
coffee for two hours I don't have much

[16:01]
coffee for two hours I don't have much
insight into his expenses and income but
I'm curious how I'd go about evaluating
this type of business if I bought it one
way I would do add value and improve it
would be to just raise the quality of
product and maybe cut those uh contracts
that don't add much and focus on the
ones that bring in the most 8020 should
we do one or more or are these two good
enough so backing up so let me summarize
what he says he works for an espresso
catering business um schools companies
people corporations pay him $400 pay his
boss $400 to go there for two hours to
serve espresso he has the opportunity to
buy this business he doesn't really know
exactly how many clients they have um
he's heard from dozens to multiple
dozens um so less than 100 we're going
to assume um and he says that their
quality and customer uh support is
middle of the pack and his question is
after I buy the business um like what
improvements should I make so first of
all there's a there's a good and a bad

[17:00]
all there's a there's a good and a bad
here the good is that you know this
business intimately there's probably not
skeletons in the closet because you
already worked there so that's great
you've already drisk to call it 60% the
bad is this business sounds like it's
highly riant on the owner um so who
knows how much of this business is
coming because they want to see the
owner's face again because they like him
and they've known him for 32 years and
they've used him for 32 years and
they're just doing it out of habit and
so if someone else takes over even if
it's someone that already works for the
company um to to be determined if they
keep ordering at all so I would think
that that risk is even bigger than the
offset risk of already working for the
company so net of net I think that this
is a risky proposition maybe even
riskier than just going on Biz by sell
and buying the same um company so let's
say you do buy the business and it goes
okay I think there are ways to mitigate
against that um Dave Ramsey for instance

[18:00]
against that um Dave Ramsey for instance
he talked about ndr non- Dave Revenue
they're trying to move him out of the
company it's a $400 million company that
has historically been highly reliant on
him and he says today 70% of their
revenue comes from um non- Dave Revenue
people not named Dave and so if I were
this guy wanting to buy this business I
would start a 6 to 12 month plan to move
the owner out working alongside the OWN
owner meeting his context uh following
him shadowing him just because he works
there doesn't mean he necessarily is
shadowing the owner at all times and
letting all of the customers know
especially the recurring ones that a
transition plan is in place uh because
if if he's willing to be patient and
wait six to 12 months then he can
largely de risk and by the time he takes
over it will be a surprise to no one and
he can just keep crushing it and then at
that point it doesn't matter what
improvements he makes because he already
has a great business even if he doesn't
change anything um so I didn't answer

[19:01]
change anything um so I didn't answer
his direct question um because he wanted
to know what improvements should he make
um I think you should start with
customer service um I I think if the
quality weren't good then he he wouldn't
have so much repeat uh repeat service
but he just needs to Brand himself as
the younger guy that just really cares
that wants to do uh great um by his
repeat customers and he doesn't want to
let them down and he has big shoes to
fill yada y y um that's what I would do
so hope that
helps awesome all right we have Anthony
wanting to ask you a question here Chris
so I'll add him
in if Twitter will work with
me
right not letting me do Anthony let me
do Cameron oh there you are Anthony all
right Anthony come on mute and uh ask

[20:00]
right Anthony come on mute and uh ask
question am I speaking hibody Chris uh
thank you for the
being we can't hear you Anthony okay
yeah I'm here okay uh thank thanks for
your your time Chris uh I'm in income
tax Four Seasons um so relative new
relatively new um but his tax season
time and uh I'm trying to grow my my own
client base over the last few seasons
and I've kind of plateaued out I'm not
getting a lot of referrals um I'm
hearing that I'm giving great service
and you know getting good reviews and
you know people are always coming back
um I I I saw about the ramsy uh um lead
lead buy but that's kind of out of out
of my budget so um yeah I threw up a
site on card uh I'm not too Keen to to
collect data on customers because of
regulatory issues or accept a lot of

[21:00]
regulatory issues or accept a lot of
payments through a website but I get the
tech stack um and and I I can offer like
some consultation um maybe paid
consultation uh stripe links I've played
with that but more about like Outreach
marketing and and kind of growing this
business to get more income tax clients
correct but but specifically uh
individual and um self-employed versus
you know higher ticket clients where I I
would need EA or CPA which I'm not
planning on getting as I'm I'm kind of
too far down the road age wise to go
back to getting a degree okay so what
does your average customer look like
today is it a a business owner like you
said and if so self-employed yeah
average is self-employed uh maybe a
newly self-employed person on like maybe
getting Uber income for the first or
second year um real estate agents and
then healthc Care Professionals
okay and what is like an average ticket

[22:02]
okay and what is like an average ticket
size like what what amount of gross
revenue can you expect from each client
yeah uh gross re yearly basis oh uh per
client yeah
uh yeah gross gross revenue before
before expenses around 350 to
400 okay and that's basically every
every year per per customer yes every
season and what does your turn look like
how long are people staying with you on
average uh zero um I it very little um
I've had one client who just didn't uh
return uh other than that I've retained
all my clients out
of out of 15 okay and what percentage of
your business do you think you could
grow before really having to invest in
the business like what percentage would
you like to grow
realistically I I mean the total revenue
is quite small so it's not it's not
money that I I used to live on per se um

[23:03]
money that I I used to live on per se um
because
I so uh yeah I could I could reinvest
what I make per per season into it okay
and what are you used to is this not
your main thing what are you using to
live well I do it's it's parallel a
former recruiter so I and I pinged Cory
because I have some insights for him uh
recruiting in overseas in China and and
Asia for design positions so I still do
a bit of that and then um I work for uh
a Nationwide Tax preparing software uh
platform and I do like products product
help on that online remote okay are you
able to leverage that experience with
the the tax prepare to to acquire new
income tax customers yeah I can't like
fish for clients through through them
directly um so oh sorry so I did join
into it new Revenue share 50/50 Revenue

[24:00]
into it new Revenue share 50/50 Revenue
share whereas they drive they drive
traffic to you and you do a a 50-50 rev
share with into it but that's that's a
pilot program so there's no data to go
off there okay and of all your customers
which which customer profile do you like
the most like what type of customer
would you like to get most yeah self
self-employed um you maybe at at at the
most complex level maybe in a in a
partnership but preferably self
proprietor one to one to three
businesses maybe some passive income
through real
estate and in and on an industry basis
do you like real
estate uh I don't I'm agnostic about it
but they have unique specific needs um
and so uh one of my clients kind of
pushed me towards that because that was
her situation but uh yeah I like I like
uh clients
who um are organized and have records
yeah yeah yeah make makes your life

[25:00]
yeah yeah yeah make makes your life
easier what are your clients mostly
local or Nationwide uh mostly clustered
between Oregon and California but I I
reside in AR Arizona
okay okay
so you don't have a website then correct
I do the card site I just popped one up
correct with um my domain tax and.pro
okay do you do you get any referrals
from people no I I have not surprisingly
uh well not through my own Client List
no but when I was working at the H
Jackson hu Tax Franchise yes in fact we
grew year-over-year was mostly referral
okay so if I were you I would start
brainstorming um let's take an Uber
driver or real estate agent for example
start brainstorming where are those
people living uh online when they first
become an Uber driver or first become
become a real estate professional
because it sounds like that's when

[26:00]
because it sounds like that's when
you're most likely to acquire them is
that
correct um I that or when they get a
1099 in the mail and then they they're
confused okay looking for help okay I'm
thinking have how do you feel about cold
calling
oh yeah I did tons of it in recruitment
it's all cold calling okay if I were you
I would get a list of brokerages in an
area pick an area that you have the
highest uh concentration of customers
call it let's say it's Salem Oregon I
would get a list of real estate
brokerages there and it's it's great
because you can get their numbers super
easily we talked about this last week
and I would just cold call the Brokers
and say hey this is who I am uh I do tax
prep I do income taxes I specialize in
real estate agents I've basically never
lost a customer at least due to
satisfaction do you have any new agents

[27:00]
satisfaction do you have any new agents
that might need help with this um and
just like just be very transparent like
we have a bunch of customers or have a
bunch of customers in Salem Oregon like
I know the industry or I know the area
do any Agents come to mind that might
need help with this and just see what
they say like just talk to five Brokers
specifically Brokers and see what they
say because it's a lot easier to find a
person that can refer you five to to 50
different customers versus calling
agents um directly another thing you can
do is go to Zillow and just start
browsing you can do this yourself or you
can do this at scale and sort by the
date they were added to Zillow or real
through.com or wherever or sort by the
lowest number of reviews and those are
either going to be Brokers or agents
that are brand new to the business um
and if you can find someone ideally you
can find someone that is new to the
business and has a disproportionate
amount of reviews
that's probably going to tell you that
they're like a a rock star like they're

[28:02]
they're like a a rock star like they're
new to real estate and they're crushing
it um because let's say you learned in
Salem Oregon the average agent has five
reviews total and you found three that
have been at it for six months and
already have seven reviews like those
would probably make for a great client
um a because they're more likely to
become a client B because they're
probably going to have higher income
therefore I'm assuming they could be a
little more complex therefore you could
charge a little more what do you think
about that yeah spot on I like all those
ideas um I also think maybe I could also
do that in the healthcare space as
well oh yeah are you familiar with what
bcbas are no I'm not so it's a board
certified behavioral
um analyst I don't know pretend that's
that's true don't look it up but it it
it's basically the license that you need
to open an autism clinic and what's
great about bcbas is that they're
publicly listed online um and their
licensed renewal date is listed online

[29:01]
licensed renewal date is listed online
and it's a super in demand profession
that is growing double digits year over
year and so anyone in the world can see
when there's a new bcba and they're
going to make good money um and it's all
like their cell phone is listed online
in every state and so you could you
could even say hey
like I assume that you have someone in
your family or life with autism you
could refer to that and say hey like I I
I hear great things you're doing great
work um and I want to help you I want to
help you with your with your income tax
do you have anyone already doing
that great or dentist D I I I assume
that you know being publicly listed in
the healthcare spaces is more common
than not but all their data is right
there and I I bet they've never been
cold call cold called by you know a
savvy recruiter who's comfortable cold
calling that now is selling Income Tax

[30:01]
calling that now is selling Income Tax
Services right like that's just not a
cold call people get which is good for
you yeah thanks Chris uh amazing uh
journey and just keep keep doing what
you're doing thanks thank you again

Cool
Chris see if you can there you go go
ahead and unmute yourself I'm gonna ask
away hi Chris can you hear me yes sir hi
there um I work in the software space as
a software engineer doing um Contracting
on a sort of six to 12 month basis I'm
looking at what can I do besides just
selling my time um previously I've uh
created online courses that have done
reasonably well like low six figures um
but I'm I'm interested
in maybe buying or selling something uh
so I've been looking at stuff on
acquire. comom and flipper.com
do you think that's a good way to go

[32:00]
do you think that's a good way to go
like I'm I'm talking about sort of low
ticket um existing websites that are
making I don't know $500 to $1,000 a
month so they'd have a a sale price
between say1 and
$30,000 um and then looking to to grow
them because they've effectively already
got product Market fit now I know
there's probably you know and there are
a lot of um bad deals out there but do
you think it is worth sort of trolling
through to find a diamond in the rough
or do you think that's potentially just
more trouble than it's worth curious
about your thoughts on on that sort of
approach I absolutely think it's worth
doing that and I think I know exactly
what you should do so if I I I wish I
had your skills okay so you have an
amazing skill set and I love that you
want to put it to work outside of just a
9-5 so if I were you I would go to a
choir or Flippa as you've been doing and
I would find some sort of a SAS product
maybe it's a Plugin or Chrome extension

[33:00]
maybe it's a Plugin or Chrome extension
or just a just a SAS product on the
WordPress site or whatever and find one
that fits these
criteria it's low ticket it's really
cheap and it has very low churn and the
owner has not raised the price uh in a
long time if ever um now you also want
to make sure that their reviews are good
um it could have low churn because it's
$3 a month and people just don't think
to cancel but we're assuming that it has
low churn because it's just a great
product
that people rely on that has 10x the
value of whatever the owner is charging
um and then you're you're really not
going to know until you start due
diligence and talk to the owner and
maybe even see if you can talk to some
of the customers like ask if he can show
you his customer database that's
anonymized um you know maybe just
partial email addresses and just pick
out five at random and say can I talk to
these guys can I just say like hey I
work with owner name and I'm doing an
audit and I just want to see how how

[34:00]
audit and I just want to see how how
happy they are get them on the phone and
ask them like how integral is that
product into their life like how much do
they rely on it is it top of Mind do
they just forget to cancel or somewhere
in between and if you were to buy
something like that raise the prices if
you can ab test it even better right I
don't know what the platform looks like
but if you can take a 10% of the
customer base and raise the price from
$5 a month to $30 a month and maybe 10
to 20% churn like wow you you've got a
winner right I would take another 10% of
the customer base and raises to $50 a
month and maybe the same percentage of
people churn or maybe 80% of people
churn and you and you think wow okay I
found the sweet spot I found the
pressure point um I would do exactly
that like you're going to drisk
partially by asking these questions and
going into it um with that strategy but
you're not really going to know until
until you get in there you actually buy
the thing and you and you raise prices

[35:01]
the thing and you and you raise prices
and then literally like you could talk
about improving features and all that
but just just raise the price that's it
and just keep it going yeah that's that
definitely makes sense um one one
follow-up question uh what what do you
think about businesses like websites the
making money majority through AdSense
like you know Google ads is that just a
too much of a tricky type business do
you prefer the SAS sort of um sites
instead I don't mind that at all because
there's a huge opportunity to turn off
AdSense and turn on like a more Niche or
Boutique uh what's it called like adte
platform because AdSense is like the the
lowest payer out there so if they're
wholly relying on AdSense and you can
buy it at a decent multiple then it's
really the same strategy instead of
raising the price you just swap AdSense
to a provider that I can't remember the
name of right now but that's something
that do you follow James camp
no no I I'll check him out is he like a
a AdSense kind of guy he's like a um he

[36:04]
a AdSense kind of guy he's like a um he
buys small SAS products and does exactly
what we're talking about and probably
80% of everything I told you I learned
from him so he's pretty active on
Twitter James Camp um and he I would do
an advanced search for James camp and
look for times that he's talked about
AdSense because he's specifically
mentioned this strategy before awesome
Chris I love what you do uh thanks so
much for your help really appreciate it
thank you yep hope this
helps right thanks uh thanks Chris I
approved Jack here we got Jack coming in
now to ask some
questions oh Jack just come off mute
there you go hey is that me yes sir
awesome Chris I have a couple of things
man so I live in Louisiana I'm from
Mississippi
Tigers I I work in the oil field so I'm

[37:01]
Tigers I I work in the oil field so I'm
gone 14 days at a time back here 14 days
at a time and I've been trying to figure
out how to get out of the oil field
getting something a bit more lucrative I
have four daughters the oldest is 15
youngest is
11 okay they live they live with their
mom so uh first off I don't have any
real estate experience but I have been
following you in a bunch of Real Estate
a SMB Twitter um if I if I beat the
bricks and I find a mobile home RV park
and reach out to you anyway you could
kind of help me along with that first
one maybe even partner with me yeah I'm
happy to okay down there in
Mississippi yeah yeah I noticed when you
were down here and bought the one what
was it outside of Baton
Rouge yeah yeah okay awesome we uh I'll
start looking for those now your Tweet
and I went back and referenced it about

[38:01]
and I went back and referenced it about
a month ago about starting the tree
company you laid out what you would do
with links and so forth so I you know I
kind of tried looking around I've been
trying to figure out a crew a sub
basically because I don't care what
field it's
in um well at
work a guy I was talking to him about a
month ago at work his stepfather passed
away about a year and a half ago but he
had a little roofing company and he was
telling me about this crew all they do
is uh repairs they don't do any new
construction
anyway I went ahead and got on name Che
got the domain I've talked to this uh
roofing
contractor and I think I'm about
to I think I'm about to go live with a
website and start a roofing company what
do you think good for you um I think I

[39:02]
do you think good for you um I think I
freaking love it you're starting with a
great crew is that am I hearing that
right that specializes in repairs yeah
yeah and and I'm G to go 5050 with this
guy from work okay I'm gonna go 5050
with him it's his his crew now this crew
works for several contractors MH I put
in for a a a a home improvement license
got the domain registered the uh
LLC I've even priced the insurance here
in Louisiana now be being in Louisiana
but from Mississippi he lives in
Mississippi but he's from Louisiana I
plan to go both States
and and just start with the website with
some
SEO uh beat the bricks get a couple of
jobs built get some Google
reviews and and I'm hoping the internet
does internet and Word of Mouth does

[40:00]
does internet and Word of Mouth does
most of the work for me so let's back up
a little bit you're you're partnering
with the guy that already owns a roofie
business that that he has this crew yes
so he has the crew he doesn't he doesn't
necessarily have a business his
stepfather that was working this crew
never had a license or anything like
that well when I went he he would do
Cost Plus right so the the uh the guy
that has the roof and Pro Mario he
charges say 75 bucks a square this guy's
stepdad was just telling the
homeowner go buy these shingles from
this place and then you're going to pay
me you know 125 whatever it was and
that's how he made his money was just
tacking on top of the labor
okay and you want to partner with him
why do you want to partner with him just
because he knows this crew yeah it's his
crew we were talking about getting out
of the oil field trying to figure out a
company to start and then he brought

[41:01]
company to start and then he brought
this up do you trust him I do okay how
long absolutely do uh three years okay
and how active is he going to be in the
business uh pretty he he also wants to
get out of the oil field I mean that's
we've been talking about but uh he
already has a couple of jobs lined up
okay so you guys are both going to have
like equal roles with regards to
activity yeah and we both and we both
have TI to Louisiana and also
Missippi
okay okay all right so here's what I
think I think you should spell out your
operating agreement very clearly that's
something that's easy to overlook and I
would find the third party mediator just
in case since you are an an equal 5050
just in case you can't agree on
something obviously legal documents are
planning for the worst planning for the
outlier um events um if I assume he

[42:00]
outlier um events um if I assume he
would he agree on a mediator absolutely
okay so find a mediator someone that
either both of you know or preferably
someone that neither of you know just
literally hop on Google side by side
find a mediator Yep looks good okay
that's the person um that'll be as good
as anyone now with regards to growth I
wouldn't count on SEO to bring you any
results anytime soon particularly
because Roofing is super comp
competitive industry when it comes to
Home Services um next to pools and just
home building it's it's about as high
ticket as you can get and so that's you
know smart people have taken notice and
there are companies that are dedicated
solely to generating leads for roofers
for that reason um so unless you invest
a lot of money in SEO and are willing to
wait like three to nine months for
result I wouldn't count on a CEO but
that's not to dissuade you from starting
this business I think it's sounds like a
great business especially if you already
have an affordable reliable crew because

[43:01]
have an affordable reliable crew because
that's like 70% of the headache um did
you have any other ideas for finding
jobs and did you want to specialize in
only repairs or do Replacements as
well oh no he do he does Replacements
I'm sorry if that wasn't clear he just
doesn't do new construction he does uh
full Replacements and repairs but he's
shingle uh he he dabbles in the metal
roof uh
I think the new construction would come
down the road with other Crews and and
so forth and so on I just want to get
started with this crew I've been trying
to find a crew in anything around here
where I live uh and then boom I have a
crew they just happened to
roof uh I don't want to take too much of
your time I appreciate no you're but
you're good and you're going to see a
listener here his name is John Moore and
he he does a lot of roofing lead
generation he can help you with that
think of some ideas I know that he set

[44:00]
think of some ideas I know that he set
up a good um referral system with
Realtors and this is in Utah so there's
no competition here he could probably
give you some good tips on getting uh
referrals from Realtors because he's
been in the Weeds on that okay uh before
you let me go going back to that do you
think I need to hire a Salesman I mean
me and the guy that I'm partnering with
I wouldn't say that we're the best
salesman in the world as far far as door
too walking into a realtor's
office uh do you think I need to hire
somebody like that as opposed to relying
on the SEO no I think you need to start
off being being your only salesman so
you can really learn what the objections
are learn how to do it even if it's not
your Forte that's okay uh like whatever
discomfort you have in selling will be
partially offset by the passion that you
have for this business that you own
right and that's to be said for any
industry so I would get at least five

[45:00]
industry so I would get at least five
jobs under your belt or under his belt
or your company's belt combined and just
learn what the objections are because
the the chance that you're going to find
just a killer Roofing salesman uh that
leaves his cushy job to come work for a
startup is lower than average so when
you do find a Salesman it's probably
going to need to be someone that's just
young dumb and hungry that you need to
train and you're going to need those
skills yourself uh to train even if like
you don't have to be a Salesman you just
need to know what the objections are and
what the the pain points are with these
customers when you do talk to them got
it got it awesome thank you of course
yeah good luck and good for you for
starting this business yeah look forward
to reaching out to you man thanks for
your time absolutely cool thanks Jack
awesome I think we have what Chris 21
minutes or so yeah okay so yeah anyone
who would like to get advice from Chris
go ahead and uh hit the invite or
request to speak and we'll add you again

[46:01]
request to speak and we'll add you again
looking for how to grow a business
should I start or quit my job why are we
not this a good business idea uh
employee help partner help or just brag
about your business so um I'll add you
in and while we wait I think I'm going
to teach everyone how to order most
strategically at Chipotle so there was a
viral blog article that went you know
that went pretty crazy a year or two ago
but and that's not mine I read it but I
have some better ways so first of all I
literally have a spreadsheet where I
track the weight of my Chipotle orders
um if they're in person or if they're
mobile orders and I promise you you're
going to get about 23% more food if you
order in person all right you want to
get there to the front of the line you
want to smile you want to ask how
they're doing and then right when they
put the rice in the bowl that's when you
want to ask for extra rice okay it's
very strategic if you ask at the
beginning then they're probably just
going to give you the same amount of
Rise you have to ask them after they've

[47:01]
Rise you have to ask them after they've
already put it in the bowl okay and then
you've got to get half meat half chicken
half Barbacoa whatever it is because
they're going to give you about 75% of
each which means you get 50% more meat
for free okay those are the two biggest
things and you want to make eye contact
because if they don't give you enough
food they're going to feel guilty as
they give you a tiny bit of steak as
you're looking in their eyes it's all
big psychological mind
game I like it all right we got Jean
here Jean why don't you come off mute
and ask Chris your
question hey guys that's actually
awesome yeah you got to do it man you
gotta do it learning all kinds of stuff
here so uh I just had to chime in I got
a great question I hope um but we're
coming off the back of a SAS caller and
a Louisiana caller and so my topic is
SASS and Louisiana
um I've got a uh SAS startup software

[48:00]
um I've got a uh SAS startup software
company that's been in stealth mode for
a couple of years and we are ready to uh
go hard at the market now and so what
would your recommendations be for
finding lead generation it's businesso
business software very specific
Industries it's not something like I
don't think SEO or even targeted
emailing and stuff is going to be the
best thing but just what what are your
thoughts on trying to get out of the
gate we've got a paying customer for a
couple of years the software has been
tested for a couple years that's just
ready to get out and get
sold what is the industry like are you
able to say what you're selling yeah I
don't mind it's a law
enforcement law enforcement B2B software
huh yeah yeah and and there there's two
two versions there's law enforcement and
then there's private security groups so
there's all kinds it's basically
incident field
reporting incident field booring and are
you already selling this or is this
brand new we've got a couple of

[49:00]
brand new we've got a couple of
customers um it's we've been in stealtho
for a couple years we've got two paying
customers for four years and um
bootstrapped and
um uh just now starting to to you know
it basically the sales is me making
calls you know visiting people picking
up the phone cold calling but I need to
scale that okay so what how much is a
customer worth to
you um we target small and medium
businesses so 500 to ,000 a month um uh
is probably a typical really good sale
for us and they don't they don't
typically churn you're not losing
customers I haven't lost one yet no
again I've only got a couple and sure
and how long is the sales cycle and or
like the integration phase of this
software sales cycle probably
uh a good a good one would be uh zero to

[50:00]
uh a good a good one would be uh zero to
yes we'll buy you 30 days okay um uh
more typical 60 days probably on average
if the if you get if if we get a an
inperson demo and meeting um it's yeah
it's pretty much over at that point and
then uh implementation another 30 days
okay and is it pretty closely tied into
their their daily workflow is that why
your turns low yes that's all their
daily workflow and and generally once we
we get a customer um they're going to be
a customer really long term okay and
then of your two customers or three
which Industries are they in are are
they police agencies or private
investigators I got one in each one in
each side actually I've got a casino
Security Group and a police department
okay and what which one would you prefer
like if you could wave a magic W and get
10 more one of the two
industries right this second would be uh
let's say let me ask you this which one
would I prefer like I

[51:02]
would I prefer like I
could cash flow immediately on or which
one still takes more work to build out
um which is just a better net customer
All Things Considered right this second
would be the the casino guys because
it's it's easier to sell to a private
business than a government agency yes
and and there's also additional things
to build out and integrate and and and
migrate old data and that sort of thing
on the police side of things okay okay
it's just a more involved customer on
the police side gotcha and what what
exactly is fuel incident reporting what
does that look like to them how does it
make their life better field incident
reporting not not fuel oh okay I've got
a little bit of a cold so if I'm
sounding funny that's uh um tell me what
a what how a casino would use it on a
regular basis exactly they um they are
tracking incidents uh slips and Falls
counterfeit money incidents lost and

[52:00]
counterfeit money incidents lost and
found stuff um basically anything that
that uh that they feel like they may get
sued on they're gonna they're goingon to
create an incident report and they're
gonna uh and they're GNA document it
and and how much work does it take you
to maintain these customers like what
what is your cost on that five to 100500
to$ th000 a month
very little very little it's uh support
requests or maybe a few a year and um
the actual cost of goods so to speak in
terms of what it takes
to uh Prov it's it's a you know a
cloud uh Cloud oriented thing is
probably I'm looking at about 70%
margins okay how did you acquire this
Casino
customer um they were a part of a
company that I worked with many many
many years ago and I called him and said

[53:00]
many years ago and I called him and said
hey would y'all want to beta test some
new software we're developing that was
several years ago and
um so it was a little a little bit of a
previous relationship uh I wasn't an
unknown entity at that point but and is
it what are these companies doing today
for field incident
reporting um some of them are doing
things by uh pen and paper still um uh a
lot of them are doing things in just
Microsoft Word um you know nothing you
know uh especially on the police
department side um you know they they
might be using systems that are older
ours is is very very mobile it's all
real time interactive it's got a ton of
cool stuff um the you know what they've
been using for the last you know that
they put in 10 15 years ago it's just
outdated it's web based the support
costs are high
um okay um all right I've got some ideas

[54:03]
um okay um all right I've got some ideas
so they're obviously a lot more police
agencies than casinos right yes
but would you say is it fair to say that
it's going to be easier to acquire like
a smaller Casino customer than a big
one
um yes and I would say a small casino
with a hotel attached is probably the
best okay um not like these little like
driving casinos at a um you know at a
gas station or something I don't okay if
gas buiz is here I don't mean to step on
you buddy
but do you do you watch the
office actually uh uh sporadically yes
okay so there's there's an episode where
uh Michael fires Pam uh as a joke and
it's a joke fire and it's hilarious so I
here's what I think you should do I
think you should use direct mail I think

[55:01]
think you should use direct mail I think
you should find someone maybe a VA maybe
outscar
docomomo and I would send letters like
formal letters to the owners or managers
or whatever the title is of the person
that's going to be buying from you or
the title of the person in charge right
maybe it's general manager maybe it's
owner and I would send them a really
scary looking letter uh with like big
bold red letters on the outside on the
outside that says something like lawsuit
enclosed or you're getting sued or
something scary and I know this is this
is untraditional but you you want to get
them to open the letter and they will
definitely open the letter and they open
it and they see it like right in the
beginning like just kidding calm down
but this could happen you you if you're
not properly documenting your incidents
like have you ever had a slip and fall
of course you had have you ever had an

[56:01]
of course you had have you ever had an
employee that was fired that was angry
about it of course you have like and I
would list out the things that you know
that they're doing maybe it's Microsoft
Word maybe that's a standard maybe it's
pen and Pad list those out just like
this is a fear tactic right let's call
it what it is and say please don't tell
me you're using pen and Pad please don't
tell me you're using Microsoft Word like
what happens when your computer dies
what happens when your hard drive
crashes is it in the cloud like what
happens when your your piece of paper is
thrown away like that
little that little incident that was an
afterthought that nine times out of 10
nothing happens with like that is an
insane liability to your entire company
like one lawsuit could be could bring
down your entire company and you know
you don't want to word this too harshly
you want to kind of Le lead with humor
and then kind of make it a little more
serious yeah and then and then just you
know have the call to action your phone
number QR code website whatever and

[57:01]
number QR code website whatever and
statistically most will never do
anything but at that point you need to
start calling them you know a week two
three four weeks after they get that and
just just blow up their phones until
they answer and reference the letter own
the letter apologize for the letter and
then ask them like are they
interested gotcha that's a that's
definitely a method I hadn't thought
about it you know I I have had somebody
um uh do some uh a a bit of lead
Gathering and stuff so I've got I've got
a list of of kind of where you started a
list of some names some casinos
primarily uh primarily in California um
which is where my my first customer is
and so I've just been calling him myself
but that just doesn't scale right now I
and and calling him myself but then also
getting lists in Arizona and list in
Kentucky or whatever else you you said
you feel like a VA is a way to go maybe

[58:00]
you feel like a VA is a way to go maybe
to work on that I do or just
outcraze timing got like this letter
will put the fear in their head which
will mean it's now time for them to
solve this problem that they didn't know
was a problem before they got your
letter so manufacture the timing and
then and then do the cold Outreach right
after that thought is planted in their
head I like it I like it well outs
scraper.com I'm gonna check that out uh
that's appreciate that yeah of course
good luck right anyway awesome guys
thank you y thanks
y all right what do you say Chris got
time for two more one more uh do we have

[59:00]
time for two more one more uh do we have
anyone waiting no one waiting currently
all right well we can wait a little bit
I don't know if I have any more Chipotle
tips like H I've exhausted all of my
expertise already we got SJ here right
yeah I just approved him hopefully it
works there you are all right shaj
you're up thanks I don't know what
happened but looked like I get I got
kicked out and sorry about that but I've
got kind of I'm a tech guy I've gave up
my job in 2022 at a big tech company and
uh just wanted to look for different
businesses to do um so I've looked
through a bunch of different either
franchises I tried starting a tech
startup but something that's been really
scratching my itch lately is uh like
home decorating and one thing I've
noticed I've known people that have done
Christmas lights and they make quite
good money you know if you can nail some
good contract tracks within your city
but one thing that I've noticed that
I've been wanting to do with a buddy of

[1:00:00]
I've been wanting to do with a buddy of
mine is uh it's Ramadan coming up and a
lot of people need to decorate interior
wise and I've been thinking about a way
to do maybe something from thew Lunar
New Year and Ramadan which usually
happen every year sequentially so that's
about two quarters of decor and a lot of
people would probably go over to
Christmas lights but it's coming up next
month and I'm thinking about a way to do
that I know it's kind of acid intensive
with a lot of Decor that you have to buy
but it seems very doable at least good
margin
wise and is this stuff that they would
decorate outside their homes then so
that's the thing I I think it would
probably be more of an interior Play
Just Because I know HOAs can get kind of
dicey and I don't want to be on you know
the news or anything for yeah anything
like that so probably you do want to be
on the news that'd be good customer
acquisition yeah yeah I I grew up in
Texas and we had some issues uh for some
holiday stuff in the past so like for

[1:01:01]
holiday stuff in the past so like for
Easter so is this something that people
are paying for right now no that's the
thing it just people do it on their own
but if you look at kind of how the
markets turning you know asian-americans
5% growing population average income
about 100,000 DFW I think where you live
if you go out to Irving um you can go to
every other house and probably find a
customer and most the time people are
just buying stuff for themselves but as
the generations get younger I think
you'll see a lot more people wanting to
do interior decorating and you'll
probably see a lot more of uh stuff at
Target which has already been showing up
a lot of decoration so there's a lot of
ways to do it between Drop Shipping and
things like that but I feel like it's a
pretty solid business um just to do for
at least two
quarters so all right so I have one
fundamental problem with this idea and
that's the fact that you're kind of
inventing it right but I I think there's
a way for you to prove me wrong so in in

[1:02:00]
a way for you to prove me wrong so in in
my opinion I only want to invent an idea
when I'm going big right like uber like
raise money this is brand new we're
Boomer bus we're shooting for the moon
or nothing um I think this is that same
type of idea but without as much upside
because people aren't paying for this at
least that you don't know of and that
makes me fundamentally nervous to to
charge for something that people aren't
currently paying for it it could mean
that you have a monopoly and you're
crushing it and you keep the secret to
yourself and you silently print money
but 90% of the time it means that
they're not paying for it because
there's there's not demand to for it to
be paid for right even if they're
decorating there's a difference between
something that people do and something
that people are willing to pay for but
the good news is I think you could you
could prove me wrong or right by just
asking people yeah absolutely yeah I
mean like would you pay for this and how
much would you pay for it and then
there's a third question that you can't
skip will you pay me for it because I if

[1:03:02]
skip will you pay me for it because I if
you especially if you're talking to
friends and family oh yeah that's a
great idea oh I would pay for it okay
it's gonna be $400 I'll be there on
Thursday oh well uh uh well you know so
you have to ask all like you literally
can't know the true intent or the true
outcome of this business until you pitch
them at the end of the survey or else
totally result I definitely agree First
Step was Outreach but just wanted to get
the feasibility on kind of Home Services
in general and I know it's very seasonal
but you know some of the folks I know
that have done Christmas lights they're
breaking in 200k a year yeah I I know a
guy that does that as well the reason I
don't like Christmas light specifically
is because if you do want to make good
money then you do need like a municipal
contract and the amount of work it takes
to get a municipal contract for
Christmas lights for something that's
not seasonal is the same right so if if
you're going to if you're going to spend
all this time money and effort and
headache into getting a contract with
the city then do it for something that's

[1:04:01]
the city then do it for something that's
recurring or year round right right it
you know it's unless there's for some
reason there's no one pitching them
Christmas lights and you own the market
like you're in a specific Market with
low Supply um all else equal I would
rather pitch something this year round
yeah absolutely okay I appreciate that
my biggest fallacy is always coming up
with things that
don't exist yet but that's kind of why I
like doing it yeah no I got you it's
definitely exciting awesome thanks Chris
yep no problem all right thanks Raj
Chris we have one more request we have
time for one more let's do it all right
I'll approve you now Rick and then you
can get get a get going when you drop
in there you are Rick go ahead hey Chris
thanks for doing this man I'm a big fan
of course hey um I dm'd you about this a
few weeks ago I'm sure you get a million
of them so no worries I'll just uh
rehash real quick but
um Wheel Repair Mobile wheel repair

[1:05:03]
um Wheel Repair Mobile wheel repair
people are keeping their cars 12 13 15
years interest rates are liable to stay
higher long for longer um new vehicle
purchases are getting prohibitively
expensive people are going to try and
hold on to their car longer keep it keep
it looking nicer longer there's a guy
I'm involved in the Tesla Community as
an owner of two Teslas here in the
Midwest and there's a guy who does
everybody's rims for Teslas in the um St
Louis metropolitan area same guy and
I've had him out to my house twice he
does it in my
driveway uh they look like brand new
when he's done I'm like bro like why
aren't we like let's roll this out let's
find some help like I'll fund you let's
go like uh you go all over the area you
repair somebody's car make it look like
new sitting in their parking spot at
work or in their driveway at home the
work's done in an hour two
tops um what do you think is it scalable
how busy is that guy is it a nonstop
this is all he does and and any if he
ever has slow time through um just

[1:06:02]
ever has slow time through um just
business he gets organically through you
know the St Louis uh Tesla fan page on
uh Owners Club on Facebook which is
where most of his business comes from he
just um he has relationships with
dealers so if they take in a used
vehicle that they want to put a couple
hundred bucks into a used vehicle and
make it look like new and and fix curb
you know curb rash on a on a rim or two
he does that when he's slow just to keep
him busy does the dealer work but the
private you know just private
individuals who find him organic later
is he's he's busy 247 I'm he's like he's
like no I can't find help I've tried you
can't keep anybody you train somebody
then you can't keep them then they don't
show up for work and he's like it's just
it's just not worth it so I'm you know
he's just like resigned himself to just
doing it himself
yeah are you still there I think are you
there
yeah I'm here okay you broke up for a
minute all right so a couple other
questions what is his average ticket uh

[1:07:00]
questions what is his average ticket uh
size and is he only doing
Teslas oh no he does anything um it's
just the honestly I think just the Tesla
group keeps him super busy here in the
St Louis area but don't he'll do
anything um average ticket I think is
probably about 300 bucks for about an
hour hour and a half worth of work okay
is that what you paid him and he does a
good job like you can't even tell it's
unbelievable if I sent you pictures
you'd never know and I and my rims are
powder coated and both the vehicles he's
done for me you'd never even know they
were they looked like they just rolled
off the showroom floor okay all right so
I've got everything I need to know I
love this business and for so many
reasons and I I could be biased so I'll
just put all out there so first of all
my mother-in-law was in town two weeks
ago and uh bless her heart I I have a
Model S and I I let her drive it and
she she floored it over a pothole and I
have the upgraded Wheels like the wheels
and she popped a tire and I was very um

[1:08:01]
and she popped a tire and I was very um
angry because I'm like I I read in all
the message boards like these wheels are
so sensitive like so I know where every
pothole is in town I like my car has
never touched anything yeah like it it
has never brushed up against anything
and so I I was a little angry um and so
she she popped two of my tires and she
bent the wheel uh Discount Tire told me
it was bent I it doesn't look bent I
couldn't tell it was bent but they're
like you know you're going to have
uneven wear on this one rear tire I
still haven't fixed it I don't know if
he does uh bent wheels or just curb rash
but that's that's not the point my point
is like I I know there's demand for this
and it's not just because of my sample
size of one it sounds like there's
insane demand in St Louis um I I love
businesses that are built up around
Tesla because I don't know what it is
about that fan base like they are rabid
yep if I tweet about Tesla it goes viral
like I I don't know what it is like I
like my Tesla it's great sure but even I

[1:09:02]
like my Tesla it's great sure but even I
I don't get it right it's the most
polarizing car brand out there and it's
not even close and so their growth is
clearly insane they're dropping prices
they're they're they're putting out a
bunch more cars um I I think one could
crush it only doing Tesla starting that
way at least even naming the business
like bolt wheel repair or something and
then as you expand and you do non- Tesla
vehicles no one cares that it's called B
right you just change the copy on on
your website to say you do all vehicles
but I'm surprised this isn't more of
like a more of a of a thing like
pressure washing is a is a thing right I
I feel like it's the secrets out um yeah
maybe I just don't know many other
places in terms of Roi for car ownership
where you know you and especially when
we're talking about Teslas Chris they
all come off the factory with black rims
now you know like you you Cur rash them
like it's an ISO immediately mhm and

[1:10:00]
like it's an ISO immediately mhm and
just the ROI you get for somebody to
come to your house and do it on in your
driveway or while you're parked at work
just sitting there anyway couple hundred
two two three hund bucks and it looks
like new again well and here's the thing
mobile tire replacement and tire repair
is also becoming more and more within
there's franchises with Vans growing
like crazy and so if you build a
customer base over a couple years then
you can start you can start doing tires
as well right why
I've always wondered around Tesla too um
speaking about you know how how Rabbid
Tesla fans are why aren't there some
young enterprising kids out there
somewhere who are washing cars at at
superchargers oh like if I'm sitting
there I'm sitting there for 35 minutes
why don't I have why don't I have two
buckets and a truck with a water tank in
the back and hey how long you charging
oh I'll be here another half an hour
yeah I'll wash your car for 25 bucks
Rick I apologize for seeing your DM
because you're like a good tweet gold
mine like I'm getting so much content
from this one segment that should
totally be a thing I don't know how it's
not I mean eventually maybe somebody

[1:11:01]
not I mean eventually maybe somebody
with from the city or municipality
wherever the charger is would come run
you out of there but for crying out loud
you could probably wash 10 cars a day at
one supercharger before you get run out
of anywhere go well not just not just
that but a lot of Tesla owners myself
included are afraid to take it through
an automatic watch yeah so mine's always
dirty for that reason yep like I hate
Wasing it there are products you know
like Optimum no Rin onr most people call
it Optimum no Rin you don't even need a
you don't have to rinse it you just have
a two bucket system one with clean water
one with the dirty water you don't even
you don't even have to have a power
washer or you know a power wand or spray
hose or anything that could be an upsell
at the supercharges they watch right man
that is a good idea I'm all in on that
idea all right yep you you validated
everything I came to you for today okay
good have a great weekend thanks Rick

steon all right Chris why don't you wrap
