I think you're really smart with
thinking about the concept of momentum
because that second location can make a
break you and even if it's more simple
to to launch with Just Junk Removal the
lack of momentum could be a net negative
for you all else equal because you've
already cracked the complexity code on
offering two Services right now the
complexity you need to crack is going 3
hours away to a not just a bigger Market
but a different Market
welcome to the ker office today was an
awesome episode with four call-in
questions one was pres submitted first
guy asked about his junk removal
business he just hit a million dollars
in Revenue he's in tiny Bend Oregon and
he wants to expand to Portland he also
has a moving business and he wants to
know do I lean into moving do I lean
into junk removal do I go to Portland do
I go to Eugene what do I do great guy
great business next guy was
pre-submitted he wants to buy a tortilla
route like on bis buy sell and he said

[01:00]
route like on bis buy sell and he said
is this a good idea what do you think
Chris next guy had a very interesting
question he and his wife or his wife and
a friend answer questions for a very
popular fitness influencer with 1.1
million followers and he wants to take
all of her DMS and comment and turn it
into some sort of a digital product
newsletter a book or something and I'm
not gonna lie I had some really good
ideas for him okay and the last caller
wants to start a Flow Rider business
Flow Rider is like a an inflatable faux
surfing concept cep that's getting
really popular in Asia and it's kind of
starting to come to the US more you can
find them on cruise ships so we broke
down the unit economics of a Flow Rider
honestly there's no filler in this
episode okay you're gonna like all of
them so
enjoy Brett how's it
going good how are you man living the
dream man living the dream good well
welcome to the ker office it's good
looking
whiteboard trying to set the or chart
get things organized you know how it
goes ni you need a much bigger

[02:00]
goes ni you need a much bigger
whiteboard that organization's just
going to keep growing man hopefully
that's the goal man thanks for having me
on today of course yeah so let me
summarize your question you've got a
junk removal business right yes we do
junk removal and residential and
commercial moving now oh okay so junk
removal and moving you're about to hit
seven figures in Revenue you got 150,000
people in your town and you're in that
messy middle and you're trying to grow
right yep exactly we're in uh Ben organ
if you know where that's at beautiful
it's changed a lot over the last 10
years huh yeah especially as it after Co
too it just blew up so that's been good
starting a business here but we want to
test a bigger market and really see what
we can do okay well let's hear what
you're struggling with do you mind
sharing your business so I can pull up
the website absolutely so the business
name is Liv Li Ive junkless J N
kls.com all right so let's hear what
you're struggling with yeah so we

[03:00]
you're struggling with yeah so we
started the business about 3 years ago
this is our first real business I got
basically put a $2,500 investment in the
company and since the first job we've
been running off the cash flow we're up
to about 10 employees now one office
staff and then we have a virtual
assistant who helps organize kind of our
backend metrics they just all our
financials and so we've got a relatively
small crew of guys and we're at this
point right now where on the junk
removal side we are the market owners in
terms of market share so we probably
it's hard to guesstimate but based off a
revenue and the amount of jobs that
we're calculating through dis reverse
engineering
Google probably roughly 40 to 50% of
jobs are going through us on the junk
removal side and then moving is growing
so that's probably closer to 10 or
15% we've got one franchise here in town
with college hunks and we pretty much
you know we're playing neck and neck
with them and so we feel like we want to

[04:00]
with them and so we feel like we want to
grow into Portland it's a three-hour
Drive North from us and that's about a
third of Oregon's population so we feel
like this could be a good market for us
to expand
into the issue is with growth especially
in the cash flow side starting a new
market in a bigger area like Portland
we're trying to project how long is it
going to take for us to become Pro
profitable but also take a little bit of
market share we're going back and forth
between should we grow with invest with
just cash flow or try and take
investment and go that route and so
that's where we're at right now okay
have you done any research yet as to how
much competition you have in Portland we
have yes so on the junk R side we've got
the three big franchises in the junk
remal space and then we've got about two
local players that actually answer their
phone and don't just sound like chucking
the truck so we've got about five
competitors in the entire Portland metro
which is about an hour drive let's say
you're smack down the middle well I

[05:01]
you're smack down the middle well I
thought wasn't Portland three hours away
three hours away but if you're let's say
you're smack dab in the middle of
Portland you okay okay
gotcha so five potential competitors so
you'd be the sixth we'd be six yeah big
player ideally and Port Portland's like
eight 10 times bigger than bend yeah I
think it's about 10 times bigger now
maybe a little bit more and how many
competitors do you have in Bend just the
one in junk removal we've got about
seven and then in the movie side about
three so you have seven competitors in
Bend but only five in Portland so so we
have seven good competitors in Bend
actually like that would say they they
answer their phone they're out every day
actually working majority in Portland
it's a lot of oneman trucks with a dump
trailer and it's you know we called
about we scraped about 50 companies
called them all and about five actually
sounded like they run a real business
they're going compe the same customers

[06:01]
they're going compe the same customers
we are the ones that actually will spend
for brand versus just like I want the
cheapest guy basically that helps okay
and so five competitors in Portland that
are legit that would be direct
competitors you're not even counting
Chuck in a truck as a competitor no
because a lot of their customers are
going to be the people that just want to
pay the lowest amount yeah and that's
not who we're trying to go for and so in
Ben you have five legitimate competitors
or or seven legitimate competitors seven
where we call them we know most of them
they actually do a pretty good job I
would say there's two that
are just about they're organized they
have good pricing set up and they know
how to run a business okay so on paper
like there's significantly less
competition per capita in Portland than
bend right like significantly less
absolutely there's more so from a
marking perspective PPC is how we gain
initial traction and there's a lot of
competitors playing on the PPC side so

[07:00]
competitors playing on the PPC side so
there would be a lot of money that would
have to go into developing the marketing
there but in terms of the actual
competition I'm pretty sure we could
rank up there with Junk King and got
junk and and blow them out of the water
just because we're small and we can act
Nimble and we're not a franchise yeah
have you looked at starting in Eugene
just as like a because that first second
Market is a big deal right like to go
from two to three no big deal one to two
is a big deal have you thought about
dipping your toe in the water in Eugene
especially since it's closer and smaller
yeah we have we actually we've
definitely considered that the
population is a little bit smaller and
we don't know the demographic as well
and so that was our it's a college our
hesitation there yeah uo is there and
it's definitely a college town do you
know what the competition looks like
there yeah there's two franchises
there's junk luggers and I think there's
junk King in Eugene as well I believe
and then there's just some local
guys we're mainly worried about the the
franchisees because they actually know

[08:01]
franchisees because they actually know
how to Market in brand that's really the
the big thing in Jump yeah it looks like
it's not even that much closer than
Portland right half hour half hour okay
same with
Salem Salem's yep it's about a half hour
closer okay so when it comes to junk
removal and moving what do you like more
what side of the business are you
wanting to lean into when we first start
in Portland I really do think that junk
removal overall is profitable from the
beginning but moving has more demand and
so it really I'm torn 5050 and looking
at the data moving has about double the
search volume as junk does and so for us
operationally we would send down one of
our team leads that's currently here and
set him up as an operations manager down
there and we would handle the
marketing but he has experience in both
moving and junk removal and so we could
honestly play it both ways it's just I
actually would love your opinion do you

[09:01]
actually would love your opinion do you
think that's too much to try and do both
or would you focus on one to
start if I were expanding into a new
market I would definitely start with one
because that's what you did here not
really by Design but you started a junk
company right so that's more familiar
you're using the same truck for both
Services right so we utilize for
Portland let's say we started both there
we would buy a dump truck and we'
probably rent a box truck from piny to
get going okay yeah okay so pretty low
cost to start because you are able to
rent exactly most our cost is honestly
marketing and then the operation manager
salary okay how often are the two
Services paired together about 50% of
the time okay and that's just like
without you having to to push it it's
just like if someone needs junk removed
50% chance they're going to need moving
as well within six months to a year is
what we're finding because a lot of Cl
it usually it's the reverse if someone's
moving a lot of times junk removal right

[10:00]
moving a lot of times junk removal right
away if someone needs junk removal we'll
pitch to the fact that they we do moving
and then six months down the road they
usually call us to do the move so you're
remarketing to these guys are you
keeping them in an email list and all
that yes we utilize shabber and then we
have they just unleash their whole new
marketing campaign so we've been sending
out wow we I think we have 3,000 people
that are on that okay so in your opinion
it makes sense to keep doing both it's
not too difficult to do moving as well
like you want to keep leaning into that
or you're on the fence they're so
similar and that's why it was a natural
progression that's why colge hunks
really did that is because they're they
go hand inand labor wise it's just some
of the systems in planning are a little
bit different that's it how is your
pricing compared to college hunks or
Junk King on the junk side we're about
$30 cheaper on a full load basis so if
you f up a full truck how much is a full
load so every franchise usually from
what I've seen is between 750 and 800
depending on the market for a full fit

[11:02]
depending on the market for a full fit
yard truck so you were within 5% cost of
the big guys exactly okay and we really
take the approach like we want to be the
Chick-fil-A or Less Schwab of these
industries so we try and be clean cut
polos good customer service and then our
pricing super comparable so it's like
are you going to choose the local guy or
you going to choose the franchise which
that's why we had success in that moving
though is really just a customer service
game because it's very regulated your
prices are decided for you and so
everyone's the same I don't understand
that what do you mean so in Oregon and
in a lot of States if you're doing an
inates so like a local move less than 50
miles we have to follow a a tariff that
defines our prices for us um if you do
long distance it's based on weight and
distance and so it's just everyone is
very similar similarly
priced and I had no idea super regulated
I know I knew Oregon was very regulated

[12:01]
I know I knew Oregon was very regulated
but I didn't know that was a thing how
common is that in other states super
common because what was happening is
back in the 90s and early 2000s movers
were holding Cario hostage until they
price up and so they forced a very
regulated system so now every state has
some type of Department of
Transportation that you have to be
aligned with and then obviously the US
do to do anything across state
lines that is fascinating I had no idea
I'm I'm so cheap like I don't pay movers
like I'm so cheap and I'm so lazy that I
don't move so I don't have to move my
stuff but if I did move I would move my
own stuff so I hear you man so right now
G to the Head what are you gonna do to
grow go to Portland do both at the same
time or start with one that really we're
kind of torn we have the experience in
in the systems right now to where we
could what we're really trying to do is
build a training system
to improve our our leadership in the

[13:01]
to improve our our leadership in the
current staff we have and use them as
Chick-fil-A method of hey we'll give you
partial ownership in this business pay
for performance you've got to train the
guys under you so I'm pretty confident
we can do that successfully that's
easier said than done that next person
can go to the next Market introduce both
services and we could run both okay
spontaneously do you have a specific
person in mind for Portland yet we do
and he's his name is Ryan he's been on
our crew for about a year and a half and
he has about three years moving
experience prior to that as well so he's
pretty versed in the industry who would
step in for him in Bend if he were to
move to Portland we've got a guy named
Bryce on the team and he's shown
initiative and he understands the
systems and how he worked and so he
would replace
Ryan yeah do you think Bryce might be
the second guy to go to Portland I think
he if that model worked I think he would
actually want to take it to a different
location so that's Portland seems so big

[14:01]
location so that's Portland seems so big
it's super big and so that's we don't
want to overextend ourselves with the
cash flow we do have which is why we're
in this weird Middle Ground where it's
we've maxed out what we can do in Bend
yeah so it's the only other option
unless we just want to stay content who
wants to do that exactly it's too boring
we got to progress that's why we're on
this Earth y have you already talked
about territories what was the first
guy's name Ryan Ryan have you ever
already talked about a territory of
Portland with Ryan yeah so we've already
had this conversation and he's very
interested we would focus really what
what we want to do is narrow down
Portland into one small circle to start
in and that would be the west side of
Portland so we're Nikes based so beever
and the the higher end suburbs that's
where we start have you done more
granular PPC research or competitive
research based on territories within
Portland we have so we've done keyword
research and what the average price is
and it's super comparable to bend so
it's okay it's ranging between $15 to

[15:01]
it's okay it's ranging between $15 to
$100 for an actual
conversion okay expensive it's
competitive yeah and if you were to use
Ryan for this would you start with one
service or
both to be honest my gut took me to do
both because I know I can create instant
demand off the moving yeah but I know it
makes it more complex junk is going to
probably take longer because people vet
junk companies more actually they
actually look into them versus Ms they
just need their stuff moved they don't
care as much yeah which I thought it' be
reverse right but it it's not so it's
just this weird area I'm in right now
yeah I think you're really smart with
thinking about the concept of momentum
because that that second location can
make or break you and even if it's more
simple to to launch with Just Junk
Removal the lack of momentum could be a
net negative for you all else equal
because you've already cracked the
complexity code on offering two Services

[16:00]
complexity code on offering two Services
right now the complexity you need to
crack is going 3 hours away to a not
just a bigger Market but a different
market like a different culture Al
together right like someone living in
near the Nike headquarters I would
imagine is completely different than
someone living in Bend Oregon right Bend
is like it's on an island it's very
unique yeah is there a part of Portland
that is more like Bend than West
Portland actually West Portland's
probably the most comparable because
what happens is people visit Bend for
corporate Retreats so through Intel or
Nike or tectronics and they end up
saying hey I love this place as soon as
I retire have the option to I'll move to
bend and so the last five years the
demographic from Bend has gone from dirt
back skier to more like hey I've got a
lot of money and bend is a vacation
Market let's move there yeah and so what
we like about Portland is it's more
white collar and folks don't have trucks
they don't have access to dump trailers
or moving equipment they don't want to
do it themselves and the demographic
between B Portland like you can look at

[17:00]
between B Portland like you can look at
the moving data everyone from Portland
or Seattle or San Francisco is moving to
Ben so it's super similar in terms of
the
person
okay I don't know if that helps yeah it
does and how long have you been open in
Bend and and how long has Ryan been with
you so we're coming up on three years in
July so we started 2021 and then Ryan's
been with us for a year and a half now
it's about half the time okay okay man
it might make for really good content
for me to just turn your model on on its
head and just send you a different
direction but I think you're just like I
just want to confirm the path that
you're already on it if I were you I
would like youve been in business for
three years I would do exactly what
you're planning on doing I would go to
West Portland I would use Ryan I would
make sure that he knows what his
territory is I wouldn't promise Equity
yet I would promise a REV share to him
based on the business that he brings in
that can convert to Pro Equity maybe the

[18:00]
that can convert to Pro Equity maybe the
same maybe different maybe it's 10% rev
share that converts to 5% Equity or 10%
Equity or whatever in that territory I
would be very cautious on everything
that you promise him today because a lot
can change and you're much more likely
for him to feel bummed that things
didn't go as you thought it might go
then you are for him to just suddenly
become a bad employee right like I feel
like he's already proven himself but at
like offering Equity to employees can be
logistically tricky and I've made that
mistake in the past of offering
ownership and then when push came to
show up it was actually hard to make
that work due to external circumstances
but I think it would be a net negative
if you launched in a new market with
just one service I feel like you need
that momentum you want to get Revenue in
the bank it just feels good to get that
first job like the dopamine hit of your
first revenue is better than the
dopamine hit of like your first $100,000
month so I I would just continue on the
path you're on and and go to Portland

[19:00]
path you're on and and go to Portland
and you could be a $10 million company
after saturating Portland right it's
awesome no I appreciate the time and I
agree and the other thing on the
compensation is we might just put him on
a salary and make it performance-based
and create a hey if you climb our
Revenue ladder this is where you'll end
up and these are the benefits you'll get
versus the ownership model which is I
think probably a better bet but they're
still upside you know so great yeah
thank you Chris I appreciate the time
absolutely also I meant to say that your
website looks awesome it seems like
you're doing everything right so just
keep crushing it trying appreciate it
keep doing you're doing it's awesome all
right thank you Brett see you Chris see
you I'll go ahead and read a pres
submitted question this is a topic
suggestion for a future podcast
something I see for sale occasionally
are sales routes for things like
tortilla brands or soda brands I would
also add like FedEx routes the numbers
are always they always throw around
always seem too good to be true but at
the very least I figured it would be

[20:01]
the very least I figured it would be
cool to get your take on them loving the
podcast so keep it up so I know exactly
what you're talking about you go to bis
bu sell and you say all right I want
$200,000 per year profit businesses with
the lowest multiple oh this is a Mission
tortilla route in Northeast Texas that
Nets $200,000 a year and they're selling
it for $400,000 a year I don't like
these businesses I've looked into these
businesses before I don't like it
because usually if not all of the time
you're buying yourself a job and a
really sucky job at that usually to make
those numbers work you either have to do
it yourself or you have to hire a driver
at $75,000 a year which comes with all
kinds of complexities my good friend
Keith former owner of Heartland Bread
Company the bane of his existence was
delivering that bread and picking up the
bread that never sold to all of the
grocery stores it's not fun like
Logistics is hard and so if someone's
selling a business that's in logistics
at an attractive multiple I would stay

[21:02]
at an attractive multiple I would stay
far away from it especially since there
are thousands of other Industries with
attractive multiples that you could buy
into that have much less
headache
briam I've seen your name pop up in my
email a few times and on Twitter and you
seem like a guy that's a lot like me
just always hopping from thing to
thing yeah it's a curse honestly my my
parents sat me down a couple months ago
and said son if you're going to provide
for your family you really need to focus
on one thing and I said I'll do my best
okay well they love you that's what
matters they do they do a lot okay well
let's hear about so from what I
understand you and your wife are working
for a popular fitness influencer
managing her comments and you want to
productize that somehow
right yeah more or less so I actually do
digital marketing my wife she works for
this influencer answering DMS and my
sister also works for her so I hear from

[22:01]
sister also works for her so I hear from
both of them a lot about what this
influencer does and I'd like to keep the
the name of the influencer quiet just
because a lot of this is still how many
followers
development huh how many followers does
she have 1.1 million okay so there
there's a lot and a lot of them are
she's a mom and kind of plays into the
mom thing and so a lot of them are in
similar phases of life so anyway they've
got like Fitness and some of the health
like foods and they have a line of
health foods and protein powders and
stuff like that that they've released as
well okay a lot of the I'll just give
like a quick background on it a lot of
what a lot of what my wife does is she
just answers questions so she pretends
to be this influencer answering in her
tone they give trainings on all of that
kind of stuff they have a lot of backend
resources but they're all like Excel
spreadsheets where they have common
topics like when somebody asks about a
certain thing these are the canned
responses yep and it's pretty

[23:01]
responses yep and it's pretty
unsophisticated on the back end and then
on the client facing end all of her
content is being put out just on stories
and like Instagram essentially is her
landing page and so they've got a
website but it's a crappy website hard
to follow not super easy to navigate and
a ton of affiliate links and other stuff
like that and then they've got on the
website there's a whole section where
they have ebooks with lot of her
thoughts and education and stuff and
then a ton of podcast material and other
things like that but it's none of it is
centralized in any way it's all just on
Instagram so as my wife's answering
these questions they're all questions
that have been posted about or there's
an ebook about them or there's a whole
podcast episode about it and so then my
wife's whole job is responding to these
DMS and saying oh yeah I actually have
great content about this exact thing
here it is my thought was I actually
reached out to a couple Fiverr cre
creators to see if they could create

[24:00]
creators to see if they could create
like a kajabi or teachable course and my
goal is to just take all of the content
that's publicly available like on this
lady's Instagram account or her ebooks
like the free ebooks or even paid ebooks
that are on her website and then
podcasts and scrape all of that content
compile it into an easily digestible
thing and then pull a list of her most
active followers and run a retargeting
campaign on Facebook uhhuh my question
so this kind of gets into the nuts and
bolts of it is I've got this lady's
phone number because I've been to like
company parties with my wife and things
like that and I've asked her questions
and I'm to a point now where not like a
you know a best friend thing but at
least familiar enough that I could
probably reach out and say hey I've got
a great idea I'd love to sit down and
ask you about it yeah but I don't know
if it'd be I'd make 100% of the money if
I just push the course out myself versus
bringing her in and having her be the

[25:01]
bringing her in and having her be the
distribution the only issue is just
that it comes down to I don't know what
copyrighted I don't know what's yeah
like if I could steal her on own she has
nothing to do with it yeah so I figured
this is right up the Texas snacks alley
where you're the legal third party
seller for all of the Texas snack stuff
and worked out kind of a comfortable
like hey I st on you don't step on mine
yep so I'm I'm just curious for your
thought on that yeah so I think that
whatever you might gain in like Revenue
by just doing this solo you will more
than make up for by partnering with her
somehow and one thing that comes to mind
immediately uh which I didn't think of
before this call is using her content to
make a book like a physical book and
audio book or multiple books I'm pretty
close friends with a guy that he has
like reverse engineered the Amazon
algorithm to get like reviews and to get
Amazon to promote you and to get like

[26:00]
Amazon to promote you and to get like
certain Facebook groups for readers and
writers to promote you and Goodreads and
audio books and like he wrote 20 to 25
books him and his wife and then now he's
packaging this up as like an alternative
to the traditional distribution model
which they take 70% and he takes 20 or
30% right and so I I think there's a
world where you could take all of our
content use AI to organize it and then
use a human like a similar a human of a
similar demographic that speaks this
language maybe like a mom that's really
good at writing right that is kind of in
this mom Instagram world you could use
them to take like the outline that AI
gave you and actually write a physical
book or use AI to tell you like all
right what are five really popular books
a whole series of books that I could
write about all of these topics that
this one person is always talking about
it's actually surprising how much
physical books and audio books can make
and the shelf life on these
years or decades right and if you were

[27:01]
years or decades right and if you were
to do that it doesn't have to compete
with a more expensive course it could
just go side by side right some people
would rather read a physical book or an
audio book or have an ebook the physical
book could be top of funnel for
something more expensive but I like the
idea of you acting as an agent for her
to go find a Ghost Rider or to go find a
company like I was just talking about
with my friend that can actually do all
of the work and you're just frankly
acting as a middleman and M maybe this
third- party company takes a 20 or 30%
cut and you take a 20 or 30% cut and she
takes 51% or maybe you take a 50% cut
and she makes 20 or 30% because a
traditional publisher is going to keep
70% anyway right now granted a
traditional publisher would probably
give her an advance of 50 to
$500,000 which you wouldn't I wouldn't
want to do that yeah yeah I wouldn't
suggest that but here's the thing so my
friend approached me with this and I was

[28:02]
friend approached me with this and I was
immediately interested because the hard
part is writing the content and that's
done I write a 100,000 words a month
it's all there on Twitter right and for
her that's done it might be more video
format but you can easily take the
transcripts of these videos you can
automate that right and so I was a very
I was a very easy quote unquote sale for
him because I don't have to sit down and
write this and I don't have to do the
work and I still get a Lon share of the
profits yeah interesting what do you
think about that do you think that could
work with her and then actually partner
with her to do that so she her
distribution could just be the cherry on
top and you could tell her like listen
you're going to help throw gasoline on
this fire but there's going to be a fire
with her without you you know yeah I
like that idea as I was talking with my
I like the Swig Cup by the way that's my
wife has that's way more that's way more
Utah than Utah thing you've ever
SE um that that's the good quick call
out for my subject line in the email I

[29:01]
out for my subject line in the email I
sent you way more Utah than my accent
that's
hilarious for those I I just mentioned
the subject line that I sent in an email
to you it was a whiter whale than a
youah d that's good that's one of the
best I've seen but I like the idea of
the book as I was talking with my wife I
I brought that up actually and she was
saying that they've got a really wide
Horizon on products that they want to
that they want to roll out and they've
got a limited team I think they've got
something like 20 full-time employees
including some Warehouse people and
stuff like that so they they're spread
really thin but I think a book is on the
horizon it's just a matter of whether
that's five years out on the horizon or
in the next couple months I'm not sure
yeah but so maybe if I just said hey all
this will be a service then maybe that
would be a lot more attractive I bet you
anything that if a book is on the
horizon which I'm sure I'm not surprised
that it already is she probably already
has a title or a concept in mind right
and I did too like I've always wanted to
write a book and I whether I use my
friend or not I'm going to have a book

[30:01]
friend or not I'm going to have a book
or multiple but like he brought to me
ideas that I had never thought of for
books and he's like dude you already
wrote about this and I was like oh okay
well if you're just going to accelerate
the timeline and bring me new book ideas
that I probably never would have
launched anyways then what do I have to
lose so maybe her stick is I'm making
this up or organic produce right and
you're like listen like you talk about
organic produce a lot you want to write
a book on that crate still do but I've
also noticed from your s and there's
these tangential topic like organic
fruit or holistic eating or healing your
body with fruit I could get written for
you that you're never going to write
about these anyway right and a lot of
times when let's say an author there're
they don't have a hit book until book
number seven when number seven's a hit
people go back and buy one through six
it's like a it's a rising tide situation
I just like that idea because it doesn't
have to compete with what you're already
thinking like course it doesn't have to
compete with her do you know how big her

[31:00]
compete with her do you know how big her
business is like on a yearly Revenue
basis and or how big her email list is I
tried to I know that she does do a
newsletter I don't know how big The
Client List is from uh oh my wife told
me I think it was like one month's
numbers I can't remember what it was but
they're growing really fast is the thing
so whatever numbers my wife would have
told me six months ago they've probably
what they're they're much
bigger I I don't have any idea I mean I
could probably back into them if I had a
little bit of time but I don't have them
right now okay yeah you could also say
listen there's going to be a lot of work
for this book so I'll give you 30% of it
but for every book you sell through your
affiliate link like if you think that
you're going to sell a lot more books
than me and my team are going to sell
great let's put your money where your
mouth is you're going to get 30% of
everything and then I'll give you 20% on
everything that sells through your links
right or 50% or whatever it is that

[32:01]
right or 50% or whatever it is that
could be more bargaining power to keep a
higher percentage and you can also do it
where it's like listen let me just write
a chapter for you I'll give you an
outline I'll give you a chapter if the
chapter sucks then we can scrap this
whole project but I definitely think you
want to work with her and find some very
creative AI tools that you don't really
share with her but you withhold and use
to find some really interesting topics
or outlines that she might not have
thought of herself
because she's probably swapped right
yeah no that part is that much is very
true is that there's way too much on her
plate way too much on her teams plate
they're going in way too many directions
and so I that was part of why I feel
like having a making a done for you
offer would be really attractive yeah so
let me make sure I'm understanding you
correctly are you saying build the
course and Pitch the course but then
also
separately pitch a book idea as well and
come across as like hey we'll publish
your book for you and distribute your
book for you and you can be an

[33:00]
book for you and you can be an
additional distributor of the book I
would just approach her first with kind
of both options stated Loosely right I'm
like I think the course idea could be
very profitable for this reason but I
think the book idea could be very
profitable with this reason like for
this reason are you okay with me just
taking your content and and putting a
couple things in front of you just to
see what you think and then maybe you
put like an outline for a course in
front of her and an outline for a book
with a title and two or three different
titles or concepts and then letting her
steer the decision-making from
there okay cuz if you're like you don't
want to go all in on one or the other
cuz you want to hedge a little bit but
you also don't want to sound wish
wishy-washy so I would sound very
factual listen here's what you're gonna
expect from a course
okay here's what you're GNA expect from
a book B I think they go hand in hand I
think one can be top of the funnel for
the other I want to start working on
both I already have the content here are
you cool if I just start exploring
something and we can work
collaboratively and then I'm sure she'll

[34:00]
collaboratively and then I'm sure she'll
say yes to that because there's really
no risk and then start putting stuff
together okay so very cool I like the
ideas I think I'm gonna I think I'm GNA
mock something up like a an example of a
course and then go get a couple like
you're saying a couple ideas on book
titles a couple chapter outlines and
then go sit down with her yeah I love it
well let me know how it goes can I get
one just one additional thought on how
to break down the
like an equity split or something like
that because you were saying traditional
publisher is something like 7030 in
favor of the publisher is that would you
recommend something similar to that and
then a 20% Kickback on books that sell
through her platforms I think so I think
that would be very generous to you so
that might just be a starting point sure
but if you were to shake out at 50/50 I
think that's still pretty good to
you okay and then what about on the core
side of things same similar setup I
think so yeah I would say just for the
sake of Simplicity I would keep them the

[35:02]
sake of Simplicity I would keep them the
same okay yeah cool all right I'll go do
it and I'll send you an email and let
you know how it goes I love it man
thanks a lot okay thank you Chris y see
you see
you Patrick what's up hey those are
good-looking teeth you must have a good
dentist oh man thank you thank you
thanks for taking the time to hop on the
phone today of course yeah I'm really
excited about this one I love unique
sexy businesses and this seems like it's
one of them where are you in this
process yeah let's just chat yeah sorry
for the issues with my connection there
I am unfortunately driving right now
parked while we're recording but that
might be the issue on the connection so
it heard your podcast asking for
questions ideas if you had any and I
thought this might be the type of
business that you'd be interested in
last summer was exposed to Flow Rider
for the first time it's you might have
been on a cruise and seen one of these
but best way I could describe it for the
listeners is a surf simulator it's a ton

[36:03]
listeners is a surf simulator it's a ton
of fun for kids through adults and got
back and thought man I would love to
take my kids to something like this we
live in Texas 100 degrees in the summer
even swiming outside is hot and so
started thinking what could it look like
to create an indoor Flow Rider venue
where you give people the opportunity to
uh come
and ride one of these machines you have
some food beverage options birthday
parties those when I started thinking
about and um am interested in starting a
business that will serve my community
and help families make memories have a
good time and so I have done some
research talking to a manufacturer of
this machine and got some pricing on
that and now I'm trying to figure out is
this even a good idea is it crazy is
this something that people would show up

[37:01]
this something that people would show up
to in a way that would allow me to have
a sustainable business do you need to
have some sort of additional offering
besides just the the Flow Rider to go
with it the model I was looking at is a
two lane Flow Rider so could probably
have about 20 people 10 each side going
for hour sessions at a time and so sorry
that was a lot happy to answer any
clarifying yeah feel like I was all over
the place there but I'd say early stages
of this if I could be convinced of the
the numbers I'd be ready to move forward
quickly and just hard to do validation
on an idea like this when you don't
really have many competitors to see if
this is something people are interested
in yeah so where in Texas are you in
College Station Texas so home at Texas
amm got like 70,000 college students and
it's growing quite a bit there's a lot
of young families right
connected to Brian as well so good

[38:00]
connected to Brian as well so good
population base not a major city but
certainly think there'd be enough
population to support something like
this yeah now does it have to be indoors
or could it be outdoors as well it could
be outdoors the only reason I was
thinking indoors could make sense is in
the summertime even sitting outside I'm
a dad gonna take my wife and I have four
kids something like this if it's 100°
and 2:00 in the afternoon even if
there's shade at the venue you it would
I think be not the most enjoyable
experience if you weren't on the Flow
Rider machine then as well if it was
indoor it's something I think you could
do year round and have people even when
the the weather's not great still use
the the machine but it could certainly
be done outside does it have to be like
built into the structure or is it more
like a bounce house and you can place it
well so as I started researching it
they've got an option that is like a
mobile version that is is the same
material as an inflatable bounce house

[39:00]
material as an inflatable bounce house
it's got the similar powerful Jets to
where it looks like the experience would
be pretty similar you wouldn't have the
ability to do the the two lane option on
that so you'd have fewer customers that
could go at one time but I haven't been
on one of those personally but from what
I understand it's a pretty similar setup
to the ones that are installed in the
ground okay so it's feasible to think
that you could rent a space not have to
build like a custombuilt space rent a
space put one of these in there and have
the business that
way yes yeah so if it was hey I could
rent a space there's a big mall parking
lot right off the the highway that is is
empty could you you know rent that and
put a mobile concession stand Snack
Shack and put some shade up and you run
this during the summer I certainly think
that would be feasible could be a Poss
ability and I just was unsure of what

[40:00]
ability and I just was unsure of what
sort of traction in a place that gets to
10023 during the day you might get at
three in the afternoon yeah now how does
it work with the manufacturer do they
sell it to you do you lease it is it a
franchise how does that work and how
much did it cost yeah so I initially had
reached out to to Flow Rider directly
and uh those are super expensive to the
point where I was like ah that doesn't
really make sense but have sourced some
things from China in the past and
started reaching out to some suppliers
in China and could get one of them one
of the inflatable ones for about
$150,000 it was more reasonable than I
had expected and I'd have to have my
lawyer check to make sure there's not
some sort of issue patent wise with Flow
Rider you know the supplier said no it's
no issue but have not done any of that
legal due diligence yet and what does it
cost if you were to buy this one for 150
Grand how much can you make like per
hour maximum if if there was a line yeah

[41:02]
hour maximum if if there was a line yeah
that that's a a good question I'm a big
fan of not doing public math but the
what what I've seen is people will try
and sell something like this for an hour
so say maybe sell a hourlong slot and
you might have 10 to 15 kids that you
allow to that way the line's not too
long you're waiting 45 minutes before
you can go and cycle through the line
quickly yeah I think that you could
charge 20 25 bucks um per hour slot so I
think it'd be and a if you had 10 15
kids pretty reasonable to think you can
make 250 300 bucks an hour uh in terms
of Revenue just from those ride tickets
and if you did that 10 hours a day in
the summer could you do 2500 to 3,000
bucks in a day I certainly think if the
weather was nice and you were able to
get the word out it's it's something
that you I've got four kids I'd take my
kids up to to do something like this
yeah so if it were if it had two lanes

[42:01]
yeah so if it were if it had two lanes
and it was 20 bucks then each kid what
does it take five minutes per ride oh no
it's much shorter than that most people
are wiping out pretty quickly they get a
few tries don't they yeah so you'd be
able to go through they estimate that
you can go through a couple hundred
rides an hour so if you had 10 people
and you were able to have 200 rides over
that hour each kid going 20 times
something like that
and obviously someone who's more
advanced might last longer but when I
saw it on the the cruise most people
were not going longer than a few seconds
they were wiping out yeah I went on a
cruise on one of those and I was not
good and it was embarrassing okay yeah
especially whenever you then have the
kids who are making it look easy and
it's like yeah my pride and ego hurts
there a little bit Yeah so so if if
you've got two lanes let's just be
conservative let's say you can put 15
people on per hour two lanes so 30 kids

[43:01]
people on per hour two lanes so 30 kids
per hour for a two-lane machine 20 bucks
per ride that's what 600 600 bucks an
hour is that reasonable I think it'd be
reasonable to I think that math checks
out would you always get 100%
utilization probably not and I think it
it would vary on the weekends summertime
I think it could be reasonable to hit
those sorts of numbers but again that's
where I struggle in terms of projecting
this out it's not like there's someone
doing this down the road that I can go
and and just see hey how many customers
are they getting yeah yeah but even if
it was 50% utilization could you get 300
bucks an hour you know I certainly think
50% in the summertime would be
reasonable have you ever looked for one
of these for sale like on Facebook
Marketplace or Ebay a used one
specifically when I talked to Flow Rider
they had some used ones for sale but
they were still going to be several
hundred thousand dollar so I think
getting something from China would be

[44:02]
getting something from China would be
cheaper assuming that the quality is
what the video show and there's Resorts
throughout Asia who have these similar
types of machines that were not
manufactured by Flow Rider but uh from
some of the suppliers there in China and
maybe is there a scenario where if it
failed could just go and and sell it and
make my money back or minimize the loss
I I think it's probably a niche buyer
but I've not checked Facebook
Marketplace for okay all right I've got
a bunch of ideas so I just actually this
morning I interviewed the owner of digor
which is like a a kids amusement park
for heavy machinery that that isn't
going to go live for a couple weeks but
it was super interesting because he
placed dig world right outside of one of
the most popular shopping malls in
Houston and so he had bit in demand and
it's basically it's a 3 acre lot grassy
lot right next to the parking lot and so
it's just really easy he doesn't own the
land he just leases it and so if I were

[45:00]
land he just leases it and so if I were
you I I love this idea I would get find
as many Chinese manufacturers or
suppliers of this as possible and maybe
there's only five and I would ask all of
them talk to three to five of their
previous customers and they might be
someone in Saudi Arabia they might not
be American but try to get them on the
phone and say like all right what do I
need to know what and pay them for their
time what are the expectations here
what's a good day what's a bad day what
do you charge how many people can you
get through per hour what type of
location do you have these things at and
try to get an idea of how much money
he's actually making from that exact
machine that you would be buying as well
and then I would even see if you can put
these outside of a mall or inside of a
mall I think water is the hardest part
did you see my tweet about the the
inflatable bull riding business yeah a
few months ago yeah yeah that was yeah
that was that was awesome I look at this
very similarly and all the commenters
like what about Insurance what about
like you just buy it like people insure

[46:00]
like you just buy it like people insure
bull riding places that's why there are
bull riding places I look at this very
similarly a lot more expensive but
potentially higher upside because if you
can make let's say full capacity 10hour
day which you you might never have a day
like this six grand then let's be
conservative and say that an average day
is two grand that means you pay off the
thing not including labor cost you pay
off the thing in 75 days and maybe
you're only open on the weekends well
that's less than a year in include the
labor cost maybe it's two years it's
pretty good
Roi you could even start calling up
malls today and say hey would you ever
allow something like this either outside
or inside and law of large number says
that someone would and maybe it's a
crappy mall maybe they're desperate
maybe it's worth testing it in a crappy
Mall um maybe you go find the crappy
mall and you walk around and just start
talking to the business owners and you
find all right these guys are not doing
well but this type of business maybe an
arcade is actually still really still

[47:00]
arcade is actually still really still
doing well so I would start doing the
research just by getting on the phone
with previous buyers of these machines
and like leasing offices at malls and
see if they would allow something like
it I think you're on to something with
the indoor aspect but the outdoor aspect
is also interesting because you could if
these are portable you could just start
testing these at fairs and farmers
markets just to like learn and like all
right I'm never going to pay the bills
by doing yeah farmers markets or Fair on
the weekend but I'm going to learn a lot
about pricing and consumer behavior and
if you pay $10 do you get five tries or
three that's going to be my testing
ground for this and then use that
research to make a decision but I bet
you that there's a market for buying
something like this but like anything
when you're buying something from China
that's that expensive buy or bewar
because those things could leak you
never know there of course risks but
yeah yeah yeah no I appreciate the the
feedback and I've talked to it seems
like most of the customers are in Asia
and I've talked to one of them and it

[48:01]
and I've talked to one of them and it
seems like most of these are placed at
large Resorts water parks and there are
some here in the States but they're part
of Kalahari indoor water park this
massive water park here in Texas and so
I I appreciate your suggestions and plan
to make some calls and see what I can
find out and I am getting close to just
saying worst case scenario if there's a
way to test it and the the in lot of a
mall or do this in a lowrisk way be
interested to see if it could lead to
anything so I I'll keep you posted but
really appreciate your time and
suggestions today oh sorry I lost you
for a second but I I got the gist of it
yeah I think it's worth testing for sure
and I want to hear how it goes even if
you don't end up launching I want to
hear what you learned from this research
awesome well I'll keep you posted man
thank you so much for all that you do I
really appreciate it of course yeah
thanks for coming on yeah have a great
weekend you too see you thanks for
joining us on the C office today hope
you learned a bunch and I hope you
subscribe and share with a friend and
