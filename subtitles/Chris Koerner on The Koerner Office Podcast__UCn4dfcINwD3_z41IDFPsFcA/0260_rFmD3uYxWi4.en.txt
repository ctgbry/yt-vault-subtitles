look at this freaking guy right here you
will not believe what this guy did so
this guy walked up to John McAfee's
house the accused murderer founder of
McAfee Security and asked him to partner
with him on a business idea he had
figured out a math equation that
accurately predicted crypto price
movements and he wanted mca's help to
pitch this to his social media following
to sell access to it so after he guessed
McAfee's email address and finally got a
response mcfey said show up at my house
in Tennessee at 1:23 p.m. but I won't
give you the address until the morning
of he was a little paranoid a little
psycho finally after pitching him on the
idea in front of an Australian film crew
of all things he said the idea was
brilliant and agreed to share it twice
per week on social media in exchange for
25% of the business McAfee lived up to
his word it went massively viral and
together these guys built a community of
70,000 people and built a crypto token
that reached a $30 million market cap in
three months a year later the business
died the market crashed and the guy in
the story is me
