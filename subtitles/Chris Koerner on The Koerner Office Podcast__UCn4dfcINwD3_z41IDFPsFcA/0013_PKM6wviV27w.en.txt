a lot of people have VA agencies that
are focused on like the Philippines or
focused on Pakistan or focused on Latin
America and they do really well I think
that your whole brand could be India um
like that's come to India it's more
affordable we work really hard we
specialize in XYZ and then if your Niche
or if your brand is India and it's funny
to call that a niche because there's
like a billion and a half people there
then the services that you offer can be
all over the map and that might not be
Niche enough you might want to be
graphic designers in India for 400 a
month flat fee unlimited graphic design
there are companies charging you know 30
40 times that 10,000 a month 5,000 a
month and companies pay it it's going to
be raced to the bottom on pricing so
okay I would everyone wants to be the
cheapest no one wants to be the most
expensive
