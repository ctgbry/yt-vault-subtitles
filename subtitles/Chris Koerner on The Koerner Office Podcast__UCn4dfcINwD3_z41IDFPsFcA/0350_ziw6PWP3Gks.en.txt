sometimes I see things that make me want
to scream at Society this is my Twitter
friend jerck and he sells stuff on
Amazon last week he lost
$220,000 because over a hundred people
returned Halloween costumes that they
bought from him if this is you cut that
crap out you might think you're sticking
it to the two trillion dollar man named
Amazon or Jeff Bezos but no you're
sticking it to small business owners
