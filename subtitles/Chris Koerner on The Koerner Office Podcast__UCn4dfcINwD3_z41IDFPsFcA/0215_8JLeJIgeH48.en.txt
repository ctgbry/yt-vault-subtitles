I've got a buddy that makes like hundred
grand a year in his part-time renting
out crappy cars on door Dash here's
exactly what he does and how you can
copy him without getting wrecked so
he'll go to Facebook Marketplace and buy
a$6 to $8,000 used Honda Civic he'll get
it tuned up he'll get it cleaned he'll
get professional pictures taken he'll
turn around he'll turn around listed on
Facebook Marketplace for $400 a week
specifically pointed to Door Dash
drivers why door Dash because door Dash
doesn't care how old your car is whereas
all the other ride share services do
they just need it to be registered
insured and for the driver to have a
license so there's a whole industry out
there for this is it easy absolutely not
you got to install trackers on your cars
you're going to have people trash your
cars you're going to have people not pay
you it is a big headache for him but he
also makes a decent living this is an
industry I'm not inventing this okay
would I do it no should you maybe not
how do you know if it even works in your
area go to Facebook marketplace right
now get a Google image of someone else's
Civic post it as a $400 per week car and
see if you get any hits if you don't
then don't launch it if you do then do
follow me for more business ideas like
