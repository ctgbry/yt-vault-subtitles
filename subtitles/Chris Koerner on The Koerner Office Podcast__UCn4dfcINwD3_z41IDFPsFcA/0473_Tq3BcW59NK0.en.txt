I'm seeing some pretty cool vending
machine ideas here at the Seattle
Airport before my red eyee flight here
are the three coolest vending machine
ideas I've seen here this one gets a
dishonorable mention because it enables
people to play the lottery without any
friction which I kind of hate because
the lottery exploits poor people but I
respect the business idea at least this
is number two it's a quiet room for
people to want to have a call or get
some work done or Escape their four kids
like I do sometimes 50 cents per minute
payoff period 3 months if it's used for
3 hours a day this is day 10 of showing
you my favorite business ideas of 2025
so follow for more and this is an easy
number one for me it's called the baby
foodie vending machine and it's right by
the Seattle Airport daycare as a parent
I kind of hate it but as a capitalist I
love it and I would buy one of these any
day of the week get all of my best
vending ideas right here
