this story's wild My Buddy Marshall here
made over a million dollars in 67 Days
by having an extreme bias for Action
here's exactly what he did and how you
can emulate this so Marshall during Co
was thinking huh I should sell a tool
that people can use to open and close
doors so they don't have to touch it CU
everyone's freaking out over germs let's
make it brass because brass kills
bacteria immediately he called it the
touch tool he knew a guy in China that
makes stuff like this so he reached out
to him 48 hours later he had a design he
had a prototype he ordered thousands of
these things they were 650 each all in
and he sold them on his website that he
used to sell iPhone cases and he made
$5,000 the first day
