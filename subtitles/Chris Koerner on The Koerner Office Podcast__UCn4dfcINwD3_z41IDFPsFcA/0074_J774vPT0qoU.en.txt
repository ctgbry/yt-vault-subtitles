[00:01]
don't even worry about that you really
don't care do
you
nope okay
okay um okay EXC get this started or
what D let's get this party started
Chris okay you wanna you want to lead us
off
here no you freaking texted me like you
were coming off of a manic High
and I don't want to get in the way of a
freight train I don't want to get in the
way of a kerer freight train okay so you
start us off well I was so excited about
this episode that I ran in the kitchen
about 20 minutes ago and read all my
jokes to my wife and she was just like
she's like
uh like as if I never got to the punch
line um so but sure she doesn't have our
humor she doesn't have our humor that's
the
problem well if it makes you feel any
better that's a better action that my

[01:00]
better that's a better action that my
wife usually gives me usually my wife is
like why are you inside I thought I
locked all the
doors so I know all right so do we start
with the funny or do we start with the
business what are we
doing let's start with the business
let's start with the business I want to
start with the thing you're the most
excited about yeah all right let's do it
okay so have you ever heard me talk
about on Twitter or wherever how it's
very advantageous for people to go into
local Facebook groups groups and talk
about hey I'm a young guy or hey I just
started a business I'd love your support
and generating leads that way you kind
of seen that
bit so I talked about that a lot when we
absolutely fast tree here um and that's
how we got our first jobs James went
into these local Facebook groups and
said I'm James I just graduated from
college yada y y and you're you're
basically playing on everyone's pity
Gene right like they want to support you
they like supporting entrepreneurship
and it works and so I met this guy Rec

[02:00]
and it works and so I met this guy Rec
I don't I don't think it's a Pity genan
I don't think it's a Pity Gene but I
think it's like I want to help out the
Next Generation yeah yeah so I met this
guy named Danny and he productized this
based on my idea and he's charging 750
bucks a month to business owners to log
in to local Facebook groups on business
owners Facebook account so they'll share
their login info and he goes in there
and basically gives that pitch
systemizes it sends everyone to a Google
form and generates leads for the
business owner for 750 bucks a month
what are your
thoughts shut
up are you serious he got this idea from
you yeah what royalty are you
getting you know that kid that emailed
us about his billion dooll Landscaping
idea yeah yeah yeah yeah that's him
that's him that's him yeah so he Ed this
model to scale a landscaping business

[03:00]
model to scale a landscaping business
Nationwide with like college students
and I think there's a lot of Merit to
this there's a business around the
corner from me called um I mean we all
know about college hunks hauling junk
there's one H there's one around the
corner they have like wrapped purple
trucks and it's called um oh geez
something about like the purple company
purple pay my student loans me
see no that's an only fans I think I
don't know what you're talking about
college fund R through it College fun
Landscaping so these guys have a bunch
of acreage on a busy road with a ton of
rap trucks out front which tells me
they're doing really really well and I
think that they productized that little
hack of playing on people's supportive
gene or pity gene or whatever you want
to call
it I so here's why I want to talk about
the idea in particular in a second but
first I want to say this is why I love
Facebook I know lot of people younger

[04:00]
Facebook I know lot of people younger
than us in particular are not big on
Facebook but who is really big on
Facebook people our Ag and older in
particular Boomers and when you look at
their you know that demographic they
have money to spend they are more likely
to spend their disposable income so you
are going to a group of people where
they're gathered that have actual money
to spend and when you go to these
Facebook groups with these owners some
it's like shooting fish in a barrel
because they they just have no idea
about about technology they have no idea
how to optimize things and how many
businesses have you done like you bought
a Facebook group with one of your
companies that I won't mention that you
you know that you ended up turning into
um a funnel for for business just by
buying the Facebook group and then
funneling them to your business right so
like I think there's a ton of
opportunity with these Facebook groups
this the second thing in particular I
think it's genius sorry go ahead no keep
going I I I just think it's Genius of
him he listened to your hack that you've

[05:01]
him he listened to your hack that you've
used and he applied it in a way that you
hadn't used it he's productizing it and
selling it to business owners Boomer
business owners that don't know how to
do it
anyways and charging them 750 bucks a
month I think it's freaking genius I
know I think it's funny seeing people
pick up with stuff that I talk about and
it's I see them launch it and they're
successful and it's just like man if I
had more time that would be me I might
not be doing it as well as you because
this kid's crushing it but I could
totally do that so um
I just yesterday I was looking at a
business called uh what was it
after.com I think it's after.com where
it's these guys out of propo they raised
a bunch of money to product cremations
human cremations and so they partnered
with cremation facilities around the
country um and they have just like three
products on their website 900,00
1500 and what was interesting was I went
into similar web and did some digging on

[06:01]
into similar web and did some digging on
where they're getting their traffic from
and it's all it's all from Facebook
because 60 70 80y olds on fa or on
Facebook so where else would it come
from that sounds way
better what's um so you just turned up
your volume it sound I can hear you is
it better now much better now okay well
someone in on YouTube is commenting that
so I'm like I'm talking to him right now
his name is Rizzy RZ uh so Ry RZ please
tell what's up rzy RZ if this is better
oh dude you need you need to go get your
own YouTube account called krisy RZ
krisy rzy Chris Christopher Riz kerer
well dude I tell the kids at church that
my legal name is rizer James kerer and
they love it every time just slops every
time I just keep saying it over and over
and it it stays just as
good brother kerer no it's brother Roper
to you okay um

[07:00]
to you okay um
uh um so what are they doing out a Provo
like they have a cremation company that
they're they're providing The Cremation
Services for or they're just white human
Cremation Services okay y okay jeez
Louise anyway my point was they're
getting all of their traffic from
Facebook because that's the demographic
right but I'm think what do you think if
you if if you want to talk about it what
do you think of Danny as a his name mhm
how he's pitched us launching this
college um Landscaping Company using
this method because he so for those who
don't know Danny just reached out to us
cold sent us an email I responded back
to him and said hey seems like a a cool
business idea why don't you actually put
together a deck and send us a proposal
so he put some time into it and actually
sent over a deck with the proposal and
like anybody who's on Twitter he wrote a
good hook it was like billion dooll idea

[08:01]
good hook it was like billion dooll idea
sent it to us uh and Chris and I have
looked at it but we actually haven't had
a chance yet to actually debrief on it
and if you don't want to talk about it
now we can talk about it you know
offline but um what do you think of of
his idea and what do you think of like
actually partnering with him to launch
something like this I think there's just
like universal law in business where
it's like more headache more Logistics
more potential scale more potential
profit and I'm like I'm this old Boomer
37y old that's like less headache less
profit I don't care I just want I'd
rather do 12 things with less headache
than two things with much headache and
so I I I kind of want to partner with
him on this lead generation thing and
just find a bunch of people to generate
leads for through their local Facebook
groups right
like that could be a billion dollar idea
almost like hey forget about the land
forget about the Landscaping idea
because that there are just so many
operational things that you have to
manage in order to execute that well
he's talking about using college
students and all these different pounds

[09:00]
students and all these different pounds
essentially it's a franchise right um
whereas with this you don't have to
franchise it you can be Central you can
find these businesses and you can scale
it fairly well I shouldn't say fairly
easy much easier than you could having
to go through college students I agree
with you on that I I love the idea of
utilizing the college students and he
reached out to us because we have over
35,000 applicants to our co-founders
program and he's like hey we could use
the co-founders network in order to
launch this but yeah I think it would be
more profitable and less operational
headache to launch something that's
helping these essentially Boomer
Facebook groups yeah Maxim Facebook
let's take we're talking about
Landscaping already so let's just go
down the line and I want to talk about
that guy on YouTube who has a Channel
with millions of subscribers that just
mows people's Lawns for free and he
films it and then he posts the videos
and his whole pitch is hey let
me why would you do that well because
people watch it on YouTube uh okay
weirdo sure I feel like this could be

[10:02]
weirdo sure I feel like this could be
you could do this with any industry
right you could and there probably are
people doing it in other indust that I
just haven't researched yet but you've
got you've got negative CAC for those
that don't know what negative CAC is
negative customer acquisition cost what
did you just say to me you take someone
like Okay Kevin Espiritu who has the
Epic gardening Channel and YouTube pays
him to sell raised Planters on his
YouTube channel so his customer
acquisition cost is less than zero
because he's getting paid to Market to
his customers I feel like this is like a
different version of negative negative
CAC and I almost look at my show the
same way where it's like hey I want to
consult for your business well how much
well it's free well why would you do it
for free because people are going to
listen to it on the internet right like
that model I think is in its early early
early days and you could apply it to
almost anything especially to things
that are like ASMR or things that are
relaxing to watch um like even like an
assembly line video or the How It's Made

[11:00]
assembly line video or the How It's Made
show right like just
monetizing taking videos of cool things
like do you remember that episode I had
episode two or three the Tesla wheel
repair and then Tesla car washing one
you remember that one I know it's an
episode but I never listened to it yeah
I know I know which episode you're
talking about this guy basically said
why aren't there people Wasing Teslas at
every
supercharger and it's like yeah why
aren't there you just sit there for 30
40 minutes and the haters aka the
rational people the what about insurance
people they would say well you can't
like electricity actually yeah those
people they would say that you know you
car while you wash it but you I mean you
can put you can put Rovers on Mars we
can figure out how to do that it's like
a plastic bag or something right so if
they can give my grandma a bath in a
Skilled Nursing Facility without taking
her out of the bed okay like we can

[12:00]
her out of the bed okay like we can
figure out how to wash a Tesla without
frying its circuit we can do hey and I
just I just want to
say I just want to say I'm going to go
tell this to my wife tonight actually so
it's actually the smaller the CAC the
better
right is that
not I'm sorry I'm just gonna I'm just
goingon to power through that we're
going to call this our power through it
no
I we have a power through it segment
every 5
Seconds uh which actually 5 seconds is a
really long time but I think what's
interesting about what you're talking
about is he wouldn't have had the
negative CAC unless he had the
distribution so so like um I can't
remember his name air two on YouTube or
the guy who mows Lawns Kevin Kevin or
Lawns like nobody's gonna care to watch
their lawn mowing video at first they've
got to like build up an audience and
then when they go mow the lawn for free
they're able to essentially monetize off
of it

[13:00]
of it
um let's brainstorm what are some other
Industries you could do this
for I know you've got like one on the
tip of your
tongue honestly I didn't do a lot of
research on this topic it just kind of
came well it's okay I'll jump I'll jump
I'll jump in because that's fine it's
kind of similar to powering for power
washing for sure oh gosh yeah it's got
to be it's got to be a visual like
there's got to be a visual component to
it right because that that just captures
eyeballs where oh man this is the before
and after so power washing falls into
that mowing falls into that probably
tree trimming would fall into that oh
Gutter Gutter Cleaning um right just
like the act of gutter cleaning would be
really good those gutters or the visual
of the water like coming out the down
spout oh dude and every like it's
something that anyone could use it has
to be a service that any homeowner could
use at any given time so like Roofing
doesn't have you ever
watched if you watch those YouTube
videos it's called primitive

[14:01]
videos it's called primitive
Builders oh yeah oh yeah it's these guys
yeah so it's these guys in like Thailand
who go you're a red blooded
americ you've stayed up late watching
those videos
okay like my my kids have like love
those videos but the cool thing about it
is like you just see them build over
time and there's no talking because none
of them speak English you could have a
YouTube channel that's cleaning gutters
with no talking where're like it's like
the mix of ASMR and
uh and the video where it's like you
know the washing and then the unclogging
and then whatever the guy's swearing
when he smashes his finger but yep okay
I like I like the gutter cleaning you
know what else would be a good one and
they've actually done these before like
the before and afters of uh guys who
have like disheveled beards or like bad
and and you're a hair stylist and you go
so one of the commenters on YouTube
right now aie he said salons so that's
yeah
exactly what's up aie sinking you guys

[15:00]
exactly what's up aie sinking you guys
are he gets me he gets me I I like this
obviously Home Services Home Services
makes a lot of sense
yep let's cool let's talk let's talk
about AI generated podcast for a second
so tell us Nick what you learned what
you learned today what the background is
all right so Chris and I both launched
podcasts in the last few months months
to be specific Chris launched his pod
podcast on on February 22nd I launched
my P podcast on April 28th gosh can I
talk today I like
my I launched my podcast on April
28th before Chris launched his podcast
we had an experiment back in started in
August of last year with uh Brandon
who's on Braden sorry Braden who's on
Twitter as well where we said could we
create a AI generated podcast and it was
pretty simple we cloned Chris's voice
and then we went and found stories and

[16:00]
and then we went and found stories and
I'm using we liberally here it was Chris
we went and found stories online that
had lots of views and that were popular
that Chris had kind of compiled in a
library from all these different places
that he had read them and fed the text
through a filter and then used the
cloned AI voice of Chris combined those
two and we we created these five minute
segments called startup gems they were
just quick stories and we released those
every single day for about four months
and it was cool we had some traction we
were getting I don't know 10 20 30
downloads a day Chris probably in that
range yep and and when Chris and I
decided to do podcasts we had the
conversation he's like hey do do you
care if I transition startup gems to now
beat the ker office and I didn't I
didn't care I was like well it was your
voice
and most of your stories so whatever two
downloads a day too it like because we
we purposely didn't want to push it we
wanted to see could we just keep upload
and could it grow on its own and it

[17:00]
and could it grow on its own and it
could
not and so there was this Content
Library of I think 90 I think there's
about 90 88 I think maybe there's
anyways 90 episodes that were there and
then Chris launches his podcast on
February 22nd well I track our our
downloads every single day and I like to
look at what percentage of the people
downloading are listening to old
episodes because to me that says people
are binging on old things so I pulled up
Chris's metrics today and I was like why
is it so freaking High
people are listening to a lot of his old
episodes and yesterday about 10% of the
downloads for Chris's podcast went back
and were listening to these AI generated
podcasts that we had created and they're
they're the perfect kind of fit for his
audience right they're five minutes
they're business stories they're
engaging it's his voice and they're just
really quick to get in and out of and it
was just kind of an an aha light bulb
moment for both of us not even an aha I
should say a validating moment for both
of us because we believed in content we

[18:00]
of us because we believed in content we
believe that building a library of
content is valuable and it was the
validation of that thesis by looking and
seeing Oh man 130 people listened to
this old podcast that we kind of
forgotten about just yesterday just
because we're continuing to put out
content yeah so I think that AI
generated podcast should be more of a
thing but it should be done in a
different way where the business owner
or the Pod owner discloses up front like
this is a ad generated which is why
you're getting so much of it it's more
of a quantity game and I think you could
do it really interestingly with things
like oh like let's take Seinfield
Seinfield fans right you could get AI to
to review every episode or to summarize
every episode or something and it's just
it's just programmatic it's automatic
every single day a podcast is uploaded
and it's it's very asymmetric because
your cost is $18 a month that's what you
pay to host the podcast and your time is
it's a zero time once you get it set up

[19:00]
it's a zero time once you get it set up
you could have zapier Auto uploaded
every single day and you're not trying
to trick people you're telling people
it's AI generated but you're basically
feeding them content that when they get
to the office they're seeking out anyway
so maybe it's just a summary of
yesterday's
news right or maybe hyper it's it's a
like a summary of you know home health
and hospice news from the day before go
ahead dude dude I I just had this idea
you should take all of the the startup
gems podcast episodes or I will if you
don't want to do this and upload them to
your
YouTube and put them on a playlist like
people would binge on those they they
they would they would totally binge on
those and it's sticky and it keeps
people there and it doesn't necessarily
confuse your episodes you know what I
mean necessarily but I I think that
would be a genius idea because what
you're trying to do is you're trying to
get people to trust you you're trying to
build trust at scale and what builds
trust is like you have to get to know

[20:00]
trust is like you have to get to know
somebody and that's why podcasts and
news newsletters and Twitter and YouTube
are so valuable because it gives you a
platform for people to get to know you
very intimately so anyways I I think
that would be a genius idea another
thing you can do on YouTube I don't know
if you knew this but when you upload a
podcast or when you upload a video you
can elect for it not to show to your
subscribers so like if you just want to
kind of ab test something and just see
if the algorithm picks it up but you
don't want to spam your subscri
you just check a box and you upload it
so I can see it working what about a
service what about a service that takes
the tweets from the people that you have
notifications on for and this could be
any social media platform Instagram
Twitter Facebook whatever and then like
every morning it's autogenerated to say
like here's the recap from yesterday
right here here were the most popular
tweets here's here's what's going on
with Twitter because how do you find out
what's going on right now is like you
just kind of scroll and it it takes time
for you to get caught up on what's going

[21:01]
for you to get caught up on what's going
on and it's it's uh not proactive right
like you have to go out and seek it out
but that would be kind of cool to just
give people a daily hey here's what's
going on hey here's the update on your
industry hey here's what's going on in
this community that you're that you're
working on right it could be I'm on this
WhatsApp group with these other
Healthcare entrepreneurs and I missed
like two days worth of the conversation
and in those two days they had a ton
where they just went through and I was
like I'm not going to go back read this
you know what I mean I can do it on my
family texts too I'm like my
mother-in-law is texting me about the
baby photo that she took 35 years ago
I'm like I'm not gonna I'm just not
gonna look at it I don't I don't I'm not
gonna read this stuff so I just kind of
check out but it be it'd be nice to be
like hey can you just AI can you auto
summary the last 50 texts and just tell
me what I missed that would be so
helpful for me instead of just ghosting
people back to the Twitter idea you
could even have zapier say hey I only
want to see I want I want you to read me

[22:01]
want to see I want I want you to read me
tweets from people that I follow that
had over 50,000 Impressions just read me
those let me filter through all the crap
that no one else thought was interesting
either then you could block Twitter on
your phone do
that that's super interesting because
then you're kind of combining the
clubhouse air chat phenomenon where
people like we like to listen to audio
with Twitter right where it's like just
read me the tweet tweets you could even
like record your own voice you could
have it recorded in somebody else's
voices and it was like you know it'll be
like that would be funny to read those
tweets though could you
imagine hey hey um Siri read me the
tweets from yesterday sure thing here's
a text from Nick tweet from Nick Huber
if you have blue hair I will not hire
you a married man on any man on in a red
flag
[Laughter]
look I HED overse talent for my tant

[23:02]
look I HED overse talent for my tant
tenants I added $400 to the monthly rent
by adding a deck it doesn't even look
dangerous wouldn't you
agree I I read 17 hours worth of Nick
Huber's books so you wouldn't have to
here's what I learned about
self-motivation a
thre hey so this is this is the premium
service that we offer but then the
uh
oh did I cut out or did you cut
out uh I don't know I just did you hear
that was probably me prium no you said
the premium version and I I didn't hear
anything after that okay so the premium
version of the service would be you know
free and the premium version would be
$4.99 a month and it would include the
new and improved Huber filter where you
can fil filter all that crap

[24:02]
out well he he probably just needs it
for himself cuz he's like I own a real
business now I can't be just you know
crap tweeting at
everybody that that would be funny he
like he like gets on his phone he's
about to tweet something Nick don't
tweet that take me to the island I want
to go to the island with
you all right sorry we're going off the
rails I I really like that idea though
I really like that idea
about somehow utilizing AI
to either put out organize
summarize content information that is
that that that currently is not in an
aggregated uh place for you to go look
at yeah do you remember that new
Services could use that do you remember
the Robin Hood snacks podcast I used to
listen to I had those two guys yeah it
was a daily podcast it was like 5 to 15

[25:00]
was a daily podcast it was like 5 to 15
minutes and they did not skip a day for
like two three years and it was it was
it was live it was real it was it was
basically financial news from the day
before and they would record it like at
4 in the morning every single day like
even the day after they got married
everything I feel like you could do
something very similar but automated
like a daily summary of X Y or Z Niche
news and it just it's all automated it
updates automatically it generates the
info automatic
and well that's it well dude you saw um
I think Thomas Newell created a custom
chat GPT bot for co-founders for you and
I like he took our episodes and he fed
them through an llm or what like
whatever it
is you could do the same thing you could
train AI on you and I like upload all of
our
episodes and then have a separate thing
going and scrape news and it's like
here's the five minute you know
co-founders news for the day
and then marry those two things with our

[26:01]
and then marry those two things with our
personality clone our voices and have
the data being scraped every day we
should stop talking about this and take
this offline this is a this a billion
dollar
idea I don't know we have clear my
calendar we have ones of people
listening right now they're probably
stealing it right
now oh my gosh it's
incredible um all right all right where
where we going
next you got some notes for me uh one
thing that yeah I have one note that
just says Jess apparently that's
funny uh one one thing that I've been
thinking about this week in particular
and it kind of goes along with this AI
piece
is um you know who chth is from the
all-in podcast right yes he's launched
this he's launched this fund called I
think it's
8810 and the idea behind the fund is
we're going to use Ai and we're going to
essentially copy any of the major tools
out there we're going to get you 80% of

[27:01]
out there we're going to get you 80% of
the fun functionality for 10% of the
cost so like oh you use Salesforce but
they're really expensive no with AI now
I can use whatever a developer team get
you 80% of the functionality for 10% of
the cost and so like his whole bet is
software is going to become a lot more
tailored to individuals as opposed to it
just being this big Enterprise platform
that you pay hundreds of thousands of
dollars to then tailor to your specific
company so I'm really interested in this
idea right now and and one of the areas
that I think that it
applies is um in Staffing and I I know
that that you feel this way
but being on Twitter it's like oh man
the Global Talent Market is saturated
with people who are finding talent and
then placing them here in the United
States there's so many companies that
are doing it but when you zoom out
there's not really that many companies
doing it it's growing like crazy it's a
space that people are investing in and
that is only getting more and more

[28:00]
that is only getting more and more
saturated but it it is by no means
saturated I think that people can sort
of stake out their Claim by niching down
in that space so what I mean by that is
right now you you know you and I have
talked about this could we launch one of
these businesses with our distribution
yeah but then we'd have to you know we'd
have to go out we'd have to actually
find a team in the Philippines we'd have
to or or whatever country we're sourcing
them from we'd have to manage them we'd
have to get a pipeline we'd have a sales
team like it's a whole infrastructure
buildout that you'd have to
get but what if we didn't do any of that
and we just niched down and said hey we
want to provide Global Talent
specifically
for leads that's it that's the only
thing that we do is we do lead
generation or okay exactly right or um I
want to do outsourced Talent
specifically for videoed in and content
creation that's what sahil Bloom's new

[29:00]
creation that's what sahil Bloom's new
company is or we do Global Talent
specifically for home services and in
that model I think somebody like us
could launch it and then white label it
with an
existing uh international company so
we're like we're filling the niche need
of people who want a specific type of
employee but then we also don't have to
build out the infrastructure on the back
end I actually think that's what sahill
is doing I could be totally wrong but
when sahill posts about hey I'm
launching this company Nick Huber like
very next line is like man you're going
to crush it I'm really excited for you
there's space for everybody in this
market Nick doesn't do that crap Nick is
like very he gets butt hurt very easily
he's very competitive like he doesn't
like people labeling it being in his
space I think I think there's I think
there's something potentially there
where he's wh labeling it with sahill
and so Sill's generating all of this
stuff but then it's just funneling for
back back office fulfillment to uh to
support Shephard so I think you just any

[30:01]
support Shephard so I think you just any
that's one thing I've thinking about I
don't know how I didn't notice that
because I saw his comment and I thought
H that's kind of weird well they're
friends so whatever but think think
about their revenue models they're
totally different Shephard charges like
it ends up being three to five grand one
time and Sills is charging three to five
grand every month and so if Shephard
says hey we'll give you we'll give you
40% off so it's going to be 2,200 bucks
per placement you're going to make that
back in month one and then sahil's
company doesn't have to do any work
whatsoever and Huber's thrilled because
it's just more volume and their margins
are 80% so yeah a little less margin on
those but it's it's just a
bonus well and like a little little
inside baseball here we have a friend
who knows people in that space knows the
Huber
Sanchez space and he posted something
one of those influencers liked it and
rep posted it and then they took it down

[31:01]
rep posted it and then they took it down
because Huber reached out to them and
was like hey could you take this down
it's competing with one of my he felt
like it was competing with one of his
businesses right so if he's that petty
about something small I can't see him
being like cool about so he'll launching
something so friends are not in my mind
agreed yeah yeah friend friends were not
so that's one thing that I'm kind of
interested in right now it's funny
because the Shepherds of the world got
their start by un bundling uh upwork
right you upwork leads the pack You
unbundle upwork by doing it more in a
more Niche different way and now people
are unbundling Shepherd because that's
all landed is doing yeah they're just so
it's just the unbundling never
stops right right and it makes sense
because like the more Niche you can get
the faster you can grow and then you
know eventually when you're so Niche I I
talk about this a lot where in software
there's this concept of land and expand

[32:00]
there's this concept of land and expand
you get into a service offering and then
you start offering adjacent Services
right um and it's the same in business
you start uh an agency doing I don't
know payperclick and then you start
buying other companies that are now
doing SEO and other companies that are
doing Google my business and other
companies that are doing lead generation
like they're all adjacent to what you're
offering but you're using that Central
piece cash flows to start buying other
businesses that can that you can gobble
up and piece together I I think it's a
same thing like they're doing the
unbundling to start and then they grow
into being able to offer a bunch of
different Services yeah because I think
the secret sauce with Shepherd is the
fact that they don't have to just go
post to upwork every time they need
someone they have their own internal
database now and so landed is skipping
the line by leveraging their existing
database they don't have to worry all
right this person that Shepherd's
handing over are they going to be any
good they're pretty sure that that
person's already been vetted and maybe
working for them on other projects for
the last two to three years they're good
right so the quality they have quality

[33:01]
right so the quality they have quality
from day
one so I know the answer to this
question but for people who aren't who
don't know and that are
listening what is landed I know it I
know what it is I know what land it is I
just for them will you explain to them
what land it
is that's the hills company that we've
been talking about oh gosh D you've been
Mohammad edit that out please
I'm so stupid I don't you know me I like
read like three words in a post and I'm
like okay Co I got the gist and I and I
move on no yeah it's called it's called
autism and I know you it's all
good it's all
good I'm an artist what do you want me
to say speaking of that I have a
retraction I need to make I got to make
a
retraction you ready for this okay yeah
the last time we spoke we mention we
talked about our our pet cremation

[34:01]
talked about our our pet cremation
business Sunbeam Paws and um okay
Stephen hail our close friend at Hare
advisor guy who lives near me who was in
my house this morning what the
hell he uh when we bought the van this
sounds like really serious but I'm
actually just trolling Stephen right now
so I'll bury the lead I'm not
gonna uh I bought the van with a loan
remember we talked about the loan and
then the lender said this is there was
some weird Quirk on the title and and
they were like you can't buy this as a
business you have to buy this as an
individual so then Stephen stepped up
and he said I'll buy it and so then he
listened to our podcast and he's like oh
you didn't tell everyone that I bought
it you sold them the you so let me let
me let me be very clear Stephen hail
bought the van cash because he is a rich
and attractive man and I was wrong in
our last podcast and I gen genuinely
apolog iiz to
him there you go oh my gosh I'd be

[35:01]
him there you go oh my gosh I'd be
freaking so butt hurt I'm kind I'm
actually like butt hurt for him because
I'm like sitting here I'm like Chris
took the loan out he took a slug Sig in
that PG hey guys I just I just felt like
it was something I could do to
contribute okay I felt like it was
something I could do to contribute
spoiler alert Stephen paid cash I'm a
value ad
guy it ain't much but it's honest
work and uh theme now that we're talking
about burning dogs um I want to talk
about some of the kpis that we have okay
okay we got our dbpm dogs burn per
month tracking very closely our
cpf that's cats per
Fahrenheit um if we want to know how
fast the incinerator is running we're
tracking our TTP Tails turn to powder um
these are the kpi I just wanted to get
you up to speed cuz I know we haven't
touched base on this business for a

[36:03]
while I'm sorry you start just name
those one more time name those one more
time DP dbpm dogs burn per month cpf
cats per fahren and TTP Tails turn to
powder oh my okay what about
PBM what's that
one p uh puppies burn per

trying to optimize for our Rob um our
rate of burn so we can have our pbl
dialing which is our pause before lunch
so what's up Chris you wrong for
that we're cancelled that's pretty good
that's pretty good all right what do we
got next all right so
I I want to you know how I have that
Apple notes folder on my phone where I
write down standup bits because one day
I'm going to do a standup bit Yeah I

[37:01]
I'm going to do a standup bit Yeah I
want I want you I want you to them on a
scale of one to five
okay that for me all right just help me
out one
being it's not funny what's five for you
what's a five for you five is like Chris
Rock Nate baraty Netflix special oh one
is like hey okay just leave that out
leave that out all right you ready ready
okay so okay yesterday yesterday I went
to the bathroom at the
office and I went to go to the
bathroom that's not fair and it had not
been flushed okay I don't want to be too
graphic but someone went number two in
the bathroom okay and I was just like oh
man but I didn't have a choice it was my
only toilet okay so I was just like this
is disgusting and then I thought about
how silly that is how if you take the
average person you put two toilets side
by side by side you're going to elect to

[38:00]
by side by side you're going to elect to
poop in the one that doesn't have poop
in it already right and it's like the
one that has poop in it it's like the
the mindset is oh somebody pooped in
this oh that's
disgusting as if the one that doesn't
have poop in it has never been pooped
and what we what do we think how do we
feel about
that uh I a two that's a two okay I
think you could refine it a little bit I
don't even like that one refine it
refine you okay all
right insecurities on full
display it was stupid scratch that all
right you're gonna like this one I'm
gonna I'm gonna take a risk and I'm
gonna overhype something because I'm I'm
that confident in this one oh so our
good friend Stephen hail who I was just
talking about we went to dinner uh our
us and our wives went to dinner a couple
weeks ago and his wife was talking about
um her grandma uh this was a couple
years it's kind of an older story but
her grandma woke up one morning and her

[39:01]
her grandma woke up one morning and her
husband had died through the night
okay okay who hasn't been there we've
all been there and she was he was he was
kind of old we've all been there and so
she she looked over she saw him she
could tell that he had passed and she
went back to bed okay because she was
just at peace with it and she's like
he's in a better place and so that's
Elmer are you dead or asleep are you
dead or oh he's dead I'm going back to
bed that's going to take like 30 minutes
to get all police out here the ambulance
pronunciation of him being dead I got to
rest up first time he hadn't snored in
years anyway so I'm getting some zeas in
so she's telling this story and it was a
light-hearted mood all right it was a
light-hearted move mood we were all cool
with it we're all friends of course how
could you not be lighthearted with that
story sure we were just all talking
about how crazy that was and I just kind
of looked around everyone at the table
and like I just had to feel it out

[40:00]
and like I just had to feel it out
because it's like are we that close are
they going to be offended is it that
kind of a crowd and so I said I said man
talk about waking up with a
stiffy I lost it I felt so
bad I immediately felt terrible but they
laughed they laughed they were cool with
it he hasn't talked to me since but he
laughed in the
moment oh gosh so is that is that a good
one should I put that in
there that's a good one that's a that's
a very good one yeah yeah that's really
good okay ohh I need a second is that it
are is it just those two yeah I'm not I
wanted to end on a high note so that's
it oh you
ended you ended up here that was like a
three dude
solid
three oh that was

[41:03]
three oh that was
awesome anyway what else you got for
H um I want to hear about your online
Journal that you discovered I discovered
my online journal from 2003 2004 okay 20
years ago I was a junior in high school
and I was I listened to Emo music as you
can see in uh in that right there in my
video it says 100% sent emo and my
friend made it for me in wood shop so
we're talking taken back Sunday yellow
card Dashboard Confessional like to this
day those are my favorite bands okay and
I never really knew that I actually was
emo I thought I just liked Emo music I'm
an optimist right I'm I'm a cool guy
people like me I'm not emo I am I ear I
was in high school yeah my neck you're
pretty emo you're pretty yeah I'm was it
live Journal is that what you had or
what did you have it was it was it was

[42:00]
what did you have it was it was it was
it was uh the lift to live journals Uber
if you will it was blury BL
ry.com and I had to go through the web
archive never heard of her and and I uh
I put it all in my Google Drive but it
was pretty good I had 30,000 words in
that thing and um it brought up some
good memories not surprised yep I did a
I did a best and worst albums of 2003
and my favorite line was on the Worst
Album section and it said said Offspring
the album Splinter this CD is the king
of all suckiness come on with lyrics
like I'm not the one who acted like a
hoe how good could it
be I I should be working for the New
York Times or
something you really you really really
should oh my gosh I can't wait for like
little little nuggets out of your
Journal yeah it was good over the next
few weeks it's gonna be freaking amazing
uh I have one I have one last thing are

[43:00]
uh I have one I have one last thing are
you out of things I'm out my well is dry
okay I got one last thing so we recently
hired a chief of staff his name is Kamal
he's freaking awesome and we've been
giving Kamal little projects and one of
the things that Chris and I decided a
couple weeks ago is that this year we're
going to buy a business and we have kind
of the size of the business it's going
to be at least $750,000 in
iida uh but we were still going through
the ideation phase and trying to figure
out okay what kind of business are we
going to be focusing on and Kamal has
done some research for us and made some
recommendations and I thought I'd go
through some of these with you if you're
if you're cool on air
absolutely so the first thing that we
talked about
was products versus
Services how do you feel about selling a
product a product being like a widget MH
versus a

[44:01]
versus a
service uh where do you fall on that
Continuum you like products and or
Services I would probably prefer service
all else
equal
okay
why I feel like
services in general are less operation
things we likely won't have to have much
overhead or a warehouse I I feel like it
could be done remotely more easily and
it could scale more easily for those
reasons I agree with that so we're on
the same page
there um what kinds of well I'm not
going to tell you ask you what here's
here what he kind of Drew up Global
Talent so job board Staffing place Bas
ments um a

[45:00]
ments um a
course buying a business or being a
business owner so essentially this would
be a business it's like a meta business
it's a business that helps business or
that helps people get into businesses
so uh think about like a payroll
Processing Company or um HR or sop
creation or Payment Processing or
CRM um the third one was a franchisor so
buying a franch in franchise or um and
then the last one kind of or not second
to the last category are agency
businesses so these are going to be like
content lead generation SEO
pay-per-click digital marketing H and
then the last one which is my favorite
are zombie businesses so these are going
to be software companies that raised at
really high valuations but now I mean
they're still businesses they're still
doing well but there just no way they're
going to hit that valuation anytime soon
and these Venture Capital companies are
are divesting of them
as I'm talking about this are there any
of those that are like I really

[46:03]
of those that are like I really
like that category
businesses zombie businesses scare me
because I just I've never done that I've
never taken a VC backed business that's
failing and turned it around I like it
sounds really sexy but I think in
practice that could be really really
ugly and I'm no Carl icon right I'm not
I don't like awkwardness well
and and to Riff on that I have
experience with turnarounds but in
healthcare services businesses right
like it would be getting into Tech and a
turnaround it's like two things that are
both difficult at the same time I think
that would be a steep learning curve so
I agree I agree with
that I Global Talent I feel like that's
just something we could start more
easily like I If we buy something I want
to I really want to skip the line I
wanna I want to buy something that we
couldn't easily
recreate um I I still like the payment

[47:10]
process to stripe stripe is flat fee 3%
an interchange Plus payment processor
that basically charges cost plus 10 15
basis points I like that I like buying
something like that because it's a long
sales cycle and it takes it takes a lot
of work and time to get all these
businesses as customers once you have
them they almost never chart right
whereas if we start a payment process
from scratch it's going to be a grind to
get to that
point is there an adjacent business we
could buy that would have the same types
of customers as a Payment Processing
Company without buying the Payment
Processing
Company you know what I mean like the
customers would be easily convertible
into Payment
Processing I'm sure there
is oh be I'm going to write that note
down
uh what were the other categories Global

[48:01]
uh what were the other categories Global
Talent so Global
Talent uh the the buying a business for
business owners so the payroll HR Etc
franchising and then an
agency I like I like the franchising
business a lot the the franchisor
business um because of what I just said
right like it's a lot of it's a lot of
money and it's a lot of friction to get
to that point I on my Aaron Harper
episode we talked about that and you're
looking at one to two million bucks to
launch a franchise um and then you got
to sell the things and I feel like a lot
of people that listen to this or or read
our content they're on the fence between
starting buying or buying a franchise
and I think it could play really nicely
to that but it's operationally heavy I
agree
yeah that's again that's my that's my
hang up with it is it's operationally

[49:00]
hang up with it is it's operationally
heavy I think I'm just I'm becoming more
convinced that even though I like
operations and I think we could be good
at operations I'd rather pick something
that's operationally
light and that we can scale quickly
that's why I like the idea
of uh that I talked about earlier right
where it's like okay you white label
support Shepherd or you white label
these other services or like Dan's idea
okay forget about the college students
just go with the agency focus on on
small business owners I like those
easier I like those a lot more because
you can scale them much quicker in fact
I'm writing a note to myself right now
of like okay cool come all let's just
like we don't need operationally
intensive businesses we need light
operational intensity that we can scale
up quickly so
yep all right this is good this is good
I had fun I love I love to
I love you I love your

[50:01]
I love you I love your
family sometimes when I'm alone at night
I think about you I think about you
for all right we'll talk next week right
well yep not before then all right see
you e
