[00:00]
to me that's the Brilliance in all of
this is that you're in a mall parking
lot like you've got baked in traffic on
day one I just think that I can't get
over that that's
[Music]
brilliant welcome to the ker office so
every now and then I tweet about a
business that just seems really freaking
interesting to me and this business was
dig World which is basically a theme
park for kids to come and operate
excavators and other heavy machinery and
I knew nothing about this business this
business didn't pay me to appear on this
podcast or anything I just wanted to
learn and I thought why not hit record
right before I learn about a cool and
interesting business so I interviewed
Jacob today Jacob answered every single
question I threw at him regarding
numbers Revenue how many customers what
are their revenue lines how much does
insurance cost everything I think you're
gonna love it it's super interesting
it's a great guy enjoy Jacob great to
meet you I have no intent here other
than just to learn about your business
as if we cross path that dinner party

[01:00]
as if we cross path that dinner party
and someone sat us next to each other
and we were just talking business
because business is all I know it's all
I love it's like if you put me at a
dinner party next to someone with the W2
I'm just gonna eat my chicken and that's
it so so I just want to learn love it
love it man well it's an honor to be
here thank you for getting this set up
and I'm I love talking about business as
well I love talking about dig world so
thank you for letting me be able to do
that yeah absolutely so why don't you
first start by just talking about your
background pre- dig world like what
happened in your life that got your
brain to the point where you're like I
should start dig world yeah that's a
great question so I was born and raised
all over the southeast I went to Texas
A&M University that's where I met my
wife we have a very traditional Aggie
story dated all the way through college
and moved to Houston afterwards I tell
people she had a a real job and so I
needed to follow her to Houston she was
she's a CPA so came to Houston and just
stumbled around trying to figure out
what I wanted to do in life and didn't
really couldn't put my thumb like
perfectly on on it and knew I enjoyed

[02:00]
perfectly on on it and knew I enjoyed
people and knew I enjoyed connections
and talking to people and being busy and
out of the office definitely not in the
office and so had a few jobs trying to
get to where I ultimately landed but in
2015 I was blessed to have some mentors
of mine that gave me a little Capital to
start uh a commercial cleaning company
and so I in 2015 started a commercial
cleaning company that's still in
existence today and we're super proud of
that company but that really fored my
what I now would call my entrepreneurial
journey I think even then I probably
wouldn't even consider myself an
entrepreneur right I would have probably
just said yeah Mark and Jeff gave me
some money and I'm gonna try to start
this company I probably would able to
qualify it or quantify it and put words
around it but just knew I I loved it how
did you get there like why cleaning why
Mark and Jeff how did you get to that
point yeah why cleaning so I had one of
those companies I had stumbled around
trying to figure out what I wanted to do
with a little bit I did operations for a
cleaning company knew I I enjoyed it
enjoyed the space enjoyed the people the
people I got to work with sometimes I
most of the time I enjoy the people I

[03:00]
most of the time I enjoy the people I
work with far more than I enjoy our
customers but I love that space then I
went and sold insurance and did some
other things but W Mark and Jeff it was
really Mark introduced me to Jeff but
Mark I'm always telling people get out
there and do random things I coached
Mark's son in Little League Baseball
when he was in first grade and Mark and
I just hit it off and he was just an
older guy I looked up to and so we got
lunch a few times and that was a
goodness that was a journey of four to
five years of just friendship and
mentorship before it turned into
investment opport Char and even then
he's the one that spurred me on to do it
I I you know people I probably look at
my story be like oh man how'd you start
that well Mark told me to right it was
one of those things like he believed in
me probably before I believed or
definitely before I believed in myself
and so he saw something there and just
said hey go do this and so we started it
from nothing and now we're super blessed
and got about 400 employees and we it's
a fun fun business but so that that's
what started this quote unquote
entrepreneurial Journey but really how
we got to dig world is I've got three
kids now

[04:00]
kids now
my oldest son was born in 2015 he he was
born four days before we started our
cleaning business and so it's a always a
good motivator if you want to get out
there and hustle have a kid it'll teach
you to get out there and sell something
but in February of 2017 my wife and I we
woke up our son Pierce unconscious in
his he was almost two years old we
found out after we rushed him to the
hospital he had contracted bacterial
menitis he wasn't supposed to make it 48
Hours God had different plans and we
were in the he was in a coma 12 days he
was in a uh the hospital 75 days and
when we left the hospital Pierce could
no longer talk he's in a wheelchair now
he's deaf he has about 100 seizures a
day mental capacity probably a
one-year-old and so we left the hospital
75 days
later with a completely different kid
and we didn't know what to do right like
our life we one day we're we're talking
to him walking around throwing the ball
to Le in the hospital 75 days later in a
wheelchair and he's nine years old now
and still has all those conditions right
I haven't heard him talk since he was
two years old 100 seizes a day he's
still deaf lower IQ by our standards but

[05:00]
still deaf lower IQ by our standards but
I tell you what the kid is the happiest
most joy-filled kid you'll ever meet in
your life my wife and always say man
it's great to be Pierce right you don't
he doesn't see the he sees the world the
way we should see the world right he
doesn't care about your skin color
doesn't care about your income doesn't
care where what your house looks like he
just wants you to be with him right just
wants you to hang out with him and so
from that pierce had always has always
and still does love construction
equipment garbage trucks St trucks the
whole thing so we came across this idea
my my co-founder and I rick Bennett and
I said he let's go build a theme park
and let's with the mission of bringing
people together like at the end of the
day that's what we want to do it may
sound cheesy to some and I would say I
don't care but really at the end of the
day the thing that excites me is I can
look out this window right here and I
see people in lines and I just want to
go talk to them all and if we can have a
chance to bring mom and dad and kids
together aunts and uncles I just met a
grandpa who's been in construction 30
plus years and he wanted to bring his
grandson so they could he could show his
grandson what he did for 30 years that's
why we do what we do a byproduct of that

[06:00]
why we do what we do a byproduct of that
is yes making money no doubt and and
creating a scalable business that we
want to grow and grow across the country
but we really opened it with this idea
of how do we bring people together and
so we started fundraising in 2019 I tell
people all the time the two things that
worked against us fundraising was one we
have a crazy idea and it's one thing to
pitch people real estate investment it's
one thing to pitch people a cleaning
business those are hard in and of itself
right because you gotta show them people
can wrap their minds around it wrap your
mind around it and so Rick and I our
joke always became we we'd go into
somebody's office we'd say Hey listen we
got a great idea we're going to build a
theme park okay I'm interested where are
you going to build a theme par KD Texas
okay it's a great growing suburb young
families love it what are you GNA do
we're going to let a three-year-old
drive a skits steer by themselves and
they'd go get out I don't want anything
to do with that and so we had that
working against us and then in 2020 Co
happened that was working against us too
and so we finally got the through
persistence and crazy nights and crazy
dreams we got the park open in March of
okay so okay so a lot to unpack there

[07:01]
okay so okay so a lot to unpack there
first of all thank you for sharing your
story I you don't know me right I I I'm
just now meeting you for the first time
but we have a very similar story um my
daughter contracted a terminal illness
at age three she's still with us today
but life was never the same right she
had a lung disease and then we moved to
Katie for six months where you are to
get on the transplant list and she got a
double lung transplant so we have very
fond memories of that area because we
spent six six months there on the
transplant list but I'm very much driven
by two things one is a chip on my
shoulder from people that doubted me two
from that like I want to spend time with
my kids right because their time here is
very limited and it's just always in the
back my mind like you got to do better
you got to make enough money to where
you can afford to spend more time with
your kids because time is short right so
thank a Budd of mine sent me a a tweet
the other day and cheesy sure whatever

[08:00]
the other day and cheesy sure whatever
but I think the point is true he said if
if you died today your work will replace
you in approximately two
weeks but your kids can't replace you
right they can't replace that time and
and so I think it's one of those things
like whether you own your business or
not right I think we look at that and we
man work is the end all Beall and I
think we're absolutely called to work
hard I think that's what we're supposed
to do provide for our family and our
loved ones but man at the end of the day
when it's all said and done right it's
hanging out with the family that's the
important thing yeah yeah the graveyard
is full of Irreplaceable men so I have
to think that in 2019 when you had this
idea someone on some other corner of the
world was doing this that you were
pointing to investors saying heit these
guys are doing it they haven't gone out
of business like was there another kind
of template that you looked at when you
launched yeah no doubt there's a much
bigger version of us uh up in New Jersey
they've been around since 2014 uh and so
yes there there was a bigger version
they're what there all day our model is
a lot smaller and we can get into that
later but there's is big part you're 30

[09:00]
later but there's is big part you're 30
plus acres you're there all day
full-blown food and beverage kind of
operation but we would point to them and
and say Hey listen they can do it we can
do it right probably that little Texas
arrogance of like we can do that and
I've done the same thing yeah little
laughing and crying as we go on but so
yes there was a somewhat of a model out
there that we could point to but not
necessarily our model and so there's
still a lot of question marks and then
again right Rick and I had never worked
a day in a theme park and so I think
that was always the next question like
cool I get it how what do you know about
a them Park and our answer would always
have to be just trust us right we'll
work hard and figure it out and the vast
majority did not take that opportunity
the overwhelming majority and the few
that did we love them
dearly so it took three years to go from
concept to launch right yep yep how much
money did you have to raise and what did
launch look like we ended up total
raising probably close to $3 million and

[10:00]
raising probably close to $3 million and
launch looked awful so I tell people all
the time one of the things that I I like
to say I have in common with Walt Disney
is the day that he opened Disney Disney
World they actually call it Black Friday
they were overrun with people it was a
terrible experience people printed fake
tickets and it was a disaster now we
didn't have people printing fake tickets
but it was a complete disaster here and
that was my doing right I made the
mistake there I pushed this to open too
early we were and what sad about it is
if you look back on it we were probably
only 48 hours away from when we would
have been ready to open but we opened 48
hours too soon our all the technology
wasn't ready we I was arrogant of like
hey we'll figure it out or hey we don't
need everything up and running and we
were blessed that we were overrun with
people the problem is that we were
overrun with people and it was a
terrible disaster and so we made the
decision that night to close the par
down for a couple more days to get it
right and so I tell people as I go on I
I would probably be the only theme park
operator in history that says in one day
I opened a theme park and the same day I
closed a theme park and and so
but you know we've been fighting that

[11:00]
but you know we've been fighting that
uphill battle ever since you know
because the media is a harsh thing right
everybody covered our grand opening
every news Outlet covered our grand
closing and then nobody covered us when
we opened again oh so you know I ran
into a guy a couple weeks ago at the
grocery store he saw my shirt he said
man such a shame you guys had to close
down like dude we've been open for two
years but you know so we've been
fighting this marketing perception
misperception for a while now well they
say any publicity is good publicity but
I would think that would be one of the
exceptions right that is one of the yes
trust me found the exception Clos that's
right geez Louise so what specifically
was going wrong was it your Tech like
your point of sale system was it the
machines yeah so it was actually nothing
was wrong we didn't have enough machines
programmed yet and so the technology was
working like we were able to open and
people did some of the rides so was
nothing that it didn't work it was that
we didn't have our technolog ology on

[12:00]
we didn't have our technolog ology on
every machine yet so therefore we didn't
have enough machines going and so people
got to do it but they weit in line
forever there was only a couple machines
operating versus now we've got 30 40
pieces of Machinery out there operating
today that day it was probably like four
so it was again then was wrong it just
wasn't fully done yet yeah okay so let's
talk numbers regarding your property so
how many acres do you own the land do
you lease the land how many square
footage is your building number of
machines I'd love to hear all that stuff
yeah so we sit on three and a half acres
here so what most people don't know is
we are we're actually a tenant of the
mall that we're adjacent to and so the
the piece of dirt that we sit on has
been a grass field since 1999 and it's
just set here and so we came in Rick had
a great idea of reaching out to the the
mall and so we came in and and so we
leased the land from the mall so we're
just like a normal tenant here at the
mall we built everything out here so
what's funny is we have a lot of asphalt
around the park so people think we

[13:00]
around the park so people think we
actually were a parking lot and we just
put this in a parking lot actually the
opposite true was a piece of grass that
we put asphalt on to build our park so
we sit on three and a half acres we have
roughly Allin probably about 30 pieces
of Machinery right here 25 to 30 pieces
of Machinery out here all different
kinds and then our building so we
thematically the nice thing about
building a construction theme park is
you can essentially put a job site
trailer out here I was think I was
hoping you were going to say that that's
brilliant so but it's also and it fits
them right so anyway we're sitting here
we have it's four wide I think it's like
2,000 square feet total it's our office
but also our retail shop and areas where
people walk through at the end it's like
two single wides or it is four units
stacked together okay same thing you
would see on a job site like a a mobile
home basically that's it yep that is
brilliant and it probably helped with
like construction and zoning and getting
approvals for stuff yeah it it was
interesting uh on the zoning deal a lot
of red tape lot of hurdles because not
many people build permanent buildings to

[14:00]
many people build permanent buildings to
be this right it's dropped onto a job
site it's gone six to eight months later
so the build the we had to figure out
with the city a lot of like how do you
grade this like what does it look like
to actually have it concreted into the
ground or strapped into the ground so
there were some there was a lot of back
and forth there for a while that that
held up this specific building our
restrooms were made out of uh
construction or excuse me shipping
containers and so we kept theme there
but cost down by building out shipping
containers Okay so when you were looking
at the template in New Jersey for this
had anyone ever done this next to a mall
before or were you guys the first at
that no and really only the only
template I would say that we looked at
them for was hey you can let young kids
operating machine say they are charging
people for this and they're still in
business five years later that's right
past that there was nothing on their
template that we were like oh let's just
replicate that do that it was more of
like hey no no no no trust me Mr
investor you can take a three-year-old
and put him on an excavator because
they've been doing that we again our

[15:01]
they've been doing that we again our
technology all that's all our stuff that
we had to invent from the ground up
nothing uh from that template per se
okay to me that's the Brilliance in all
of this is that you're in a mall parking
lot like you've got baked in traffic on
day one I just think that I can't get
over that that's brilliant yeah it's
interesting yes there are definitely
malls that are dying no doubt and as a
as a whole yes I I totally get that the
mall that we're at though if you find
the right Mall 12 million people walk
through this mall a year that's insane
and so just and that area is growing
like crazy that's right that's right so
you know there's a lot of factors that
go into when somebody says oh you're by
a mall malls are dying H maybe not right
both can be true yeah if you're in
Houston Texas there's always going to be
a market for indoor
shopping the worst WEA anyway also I I
feel like I have a framework with
commercial real estate where it's like
you've got froo and yo explodes and then

[16:00]
you've got froo and yo explodes and then
it dies but there will always be froo
places in the best locations right you
got like the cold stones and the marble
slabs of the world same you've got
cookie shops like there will always be
cookie shops in the best locations there
will always be indoor malls in the best
locations and the ones in the so so
locations or bad locations will die
that's right yeah that's right so okay
so let's talk about your equipment 30
pieces Machinery do you own these did
you buy them new used lease what are we
look looking at yeah it's funny I've had
the privilege of reading through some of
the comments on the tweet that you threw
out there it's funny right what people
come in with perceptions and ideas of
how things should be or not and again a
lot of it's like people guessing right
the only thing you can do logically
guess when you don't know the answer
right but no these are to answer one of
your person's comments these are real
machines these can operate on a real job
site these are we bought them from
Caterpillar they did not these aren't
refabbed or refurbed these aren't out of
commission machines these are very much
new machines that we purchased so we own

[17:00]
new machines that we purchased so we own
them and then we put on our proprietary
technology on the back of it to be able
to operate in a safe manner to where
kids can operate like a governor
basically yeah give or take that yes on
some of the machines that's probably the
oversimplification of it but for example
on our excavators right they go only
certain degrees to the right and left
only certain degrees up and down they're
stationary you can't do anything to make
that machine go forward or backwards so
the tracks are still they're also on a a
timer so that when we Act activ at the
machine the kid or adult gets to use it
and then when that timer is done the
machine keeps running but the Hydraulics
are dead and so that's how we get kids
off the machine right if not I'd have to
be pulling Timmy off the machine every
five minutes and so that there's a lot
of components that go into that but then
there's override buttons and kill
switches then we have the ability to
flip it back when we need to do things
around here around the park either move
things move objects we can turn it back
into a quote unquote what we call a real
machine versus the Dig World mode Okay
so so do you own these or do you lease

[18:00]
so so do you own these or do you lease
them yep we own them caterpillar must
love you guys right like you're a brand
new customer that did didn't exist to
them 10 years ago you're exposing them
to all of these kids that might end up
operating or buying one in 20 years
right that's right yeah that's right so
I think our Park
wins and I'd be completely transparent
accidentally unb benosa Rick and I it
wins on a lot of fronts right so so we
win with caterpillar because caterpillar
gets their brand out here they get their
name out here they get kids thinking
about yellow iron versus Green Iron and
they get to grow up with that image of
caterpillar in their mind so whether
they buy one for their self one day or
they work for a company and they have
the ability to buy they want to buy
caterpillar so they're working on brand
identity no doubt the other thing too is
we have Partners I want saym Rick and I
did is we have partnership with A&M
they're incentivized to to educate the
Next Generation about construction
working right they know for a fact that
they can get to a kid before they're in
eth grade anytime on that Spectrum
before eth grade and convince them about
construction work they have a much
higher probability of that kid going

[19:01]
higher probability of that kid going
into that field because it's a lot like
the military right you look at the
military and people go oh I just shoot
guns or fly planes no the military you
can do any job in the military right
it's a whole ecosystem and so I think
the military's got the same issue where
they're going no no we don't just shoot
guns and fly airplanes like you could go
here and become a doctor you can be a
lawyer like and so I think A&M is
incentivized and as well as other people
in the construction industry to get kids
at an early age going well hold on hold
on you can make a phenomenal living and
doing this you also not necessarily
going to be outside pouring asphalt
every day you might but there's also a
thousand other jobs that go along with
that yeah what does that partnership
look like like how are you helping each
other yeah so A&M for example they they
provided us they had a bunch of
undergraduates and graduates write our
educational curriculum so when we host
the plethora of field trips that we have
out here during the school year we go
through this educational curriculum also
if you were to walk the park you'll see
signs everywhere of fun facts about

[20:02]
signs everywhere of fun facts about
construction right this machine can lift
this many buildings and this many
elephants and blah blah blah and random
things like that they cultivated all of
that curriculum for us and made those
signs and you'll see their brand around
the park caterpillar when you walk up
into our Park you will see the Dig World
logo and you'll see the Mustang cat
they're our local equipment provider
here in the Greater Houston Market
Mustang cat and so you'll see their name
everywhere right you come into our
retail shop on the way out there's a
huge Mustang cap wall that talks about
all their offerings and and what they
can do for you or your business now are
they paying you for that or did you get
like a discount on the on the machines
for that we have two different deals so
we have a sponsorship deal so they are a
a sponsor and then we were able to when
you're buying just like when you're
buying Fleet of vehicles right when
you're buying that much volume at once
you can negotiate some deals so we're
able to negotiate that the price down a
little bit but also again another thing
that that most people don't realize when
we were buying this machine it was the
tail end of the height of Co right I

[21:01]
tail end of the height of Co right I
mean there weren't machines to be had
and so I think going forward as we open
up parks around the country we would we'
love to strike a bigger deal with the
caterpillar or the local dealers because
the inventory is back then Mustang cat I
mean they were phenomenal they're
phenomenal partners of ours they're also
hand string back then right it was like
hey this is what we have and this is the
price because this is all we have so we
have a a paid marketing sponsorship on
top of that okay so was that one of your
biggest startup costs was buying these
machines back in 2022 and yeah so yes
and no construction cost right of
building the whole park that's the
that's the main startup cost building
something from the ground up we can we
we've been able to work in the equipment
uh the underwriting model through
different financing routes that kind of
stuff but The Upfront big cost was
obviously the construction of everything
okay now tell me about developing the
software to act as a governor on these
machines how did you do that internally
was that did you hire someone did you
Outsource it was that a very difficult

[22:02]
Outsource it was that a very difficult
process yes yes and so we have an
engineer that works with us and it's the
technology he developed that we have the
rights to and so he is our guy he was
out here yesterday tweaking some things
but yeah it was very difficult process
and again can anybody do it yeah can
anybody go pay somebody do it sure but
finding the right person that can you
know at this day and age it's like a car
right these caterpillar these machines
are computers right like the car you
drive is just a computer right the end
of the day same with these machines yeah
they're still fundamentally the same
thing that they were but they're also
computers now and so we're essentially
having to rewrite the computer that's in
the computer to set our computer to it h
yeah that's interesting I I love this
business because some businesses just
inherently come with it's like they have
baked in haters right like when you post
to social media or I post a social media
about you you know there's going to be
like two or three categories of comments
it's going to be like insurance how
how's how do you insurance insurance

[23:00]
how's how do you insurance insurance
Insurance liability what he must be an
idiot and then you've got all the people
saying like is this like is this even
safe yeah like and then you got people
talking about the price and like I just
love the idea of launching businesses
that are reverse engineered from the
comments of other businesses right to
where just a natural organic post from
your business will generate all this
negative attention that just tell the
algorithms hey let's push this to a
wider audience because people are
talking about this right that that's
what happened with rolling Suds the the
pressure washing company everyone
comments there like oh you're just
spraying bleach all over is that even
legal yes it's legal to spray bleach in
all 50 states but people don't know that
and so they all comment that and it just
grows and grows and grows so yes with
that being said what are your insurance
costs like is that a significant line
Adam yeah it's a lot but I think it's in
line with any other business again so I
think the key to any business right is
which you hit the nail on the head I've
got a great friend who's an insurance

[24:00]
got a great friend who's an insurance
broker I said hey would you ever want to
underwrite dig r no no way no way I'd
ever do that that's a crazy and that's
his perspective on my best friend who is
our insurance broker man if you find the
right people that believe in you they
will hustle to find the right carrier
that gets what you're doing right and so
listen it's always it always cracks me
up when people are like man how'd you
ever get insurance well hold on how do
rodos get insurance how did carnivals
and malls get insurance how did water
parks get insurance get a lot worse than
this right it's listen we've been very
blessed no incidents in two years knock
on wood we we continue to have no
incidents I think that one of the
biggest misperceptions is oh my gosh
these kids are just driving skit Ser
through the park no no they're driving
on an enclosed track that we have double
enclosed we've got kill switches on the
machines listen our park is
significantly safer than you going to a
go-kart Park yeah but it's a New Concept
it's a new idea it boggles the mind a
little bit which is awesome right I mean
that's why we want to do it and that's
what I mean that's what we do right
let's go do crazy things and so finding

[25:01]
let's go do crazy things and so finding
the right carrier that goes yeah okay I
I get what you're doing let's work
through it together let's understand the
technology on it and so we're fortunate
that the main carrier that we have they
underwrite those things I just listen
theme parks rodeos what so they're they
are risk tolerant and get it and again
when you understand fundamentally what
we're doing and how we're doing it and
the inspections that we go through you
go oh okay all right I get it now is it
a big line on them yeah because I've got
I'm running a theme park but I would
argue to you that our our insurance
lines are proportional to any other
theme park out there are you able to say
on a percentage basis or a real dollar
basis what they are per month it's
probably anywhere from depending upon
renewals and things like that anywhere
from 8 to 10 per. okay that's not crazy
you've got companies insuring tour
guides that put people in shark cages
right like ex right and
again there's it's always the human
psyche I'm fast by right and what you
said right you you attract haters you

[26:01]
said right you you attract haters you
attract people that like Champion you on
and you're like you're the greatest
person ever right and I like your Tweet
right like we read that we're like man
dude this guy I don't know this guy this
is awesome and and so we love those
things but it's also funny to me when
you have something new that is by
definition brand new yes I know people
want to talk to the other facilities
that are out there
now the the preconceived notions that
people walk up with right of going well
I don't think it should cost this much
money I think
well hold on hold on hold on I I love
you I love your opinion I'm here for it
but I've got a water park right over
here across the the the highway you
don't go up to those guys and be like
listen this is what the price should be
no yeah it's because it's set in the end
it's set right so there's also issues as
you start things right that fine line as
an entrepreneur and I think people
listening to this it's super important
to listen to your customer it's also
super important to know your model right
and also my we talked about time the
silent majority the silent majority
never speaks up right if we go through

[27:02]
never speaks up right if we go through
the park and and we go through let's say
we go through a whole month we see five
to 8,000 people throughout the whole
month depending upon the seasonality of
what month it is I get three nasty
reviews it'll keep me up at night it'll
drive it'll bother me in my court that's
three people out of roughly 8,000 people
now that doesn't mean that all 8,000
loved it sure they some may think it was
stupid waste of time waste of money
whatever they're never going to come
back so be it but if I fix it on those
three of the 8,000 man I'm missing the
opportunity I listen to a podcast
yesterday a guy said he owns restaurants
he say it's never as bad as they say and
it's never as good as they say and I
like that kind of that level-headedness
approach to it yeah it's funny I have
this framework where I say listen to the
haters if the hater knows more about
your industry than you right because
when I launched my first business in
college it was an iPhone repair store
and this Boomer was like quote mentoring
me and he had just owned like a home
inspection business his whole life and
he's like this is stupid iPhones are

[28:01]
he's like this is stupid iPhones are
like this isn't you can't build a
business out of fixing this new thing it
was 2010 and I was like yeah these guys
in Louisiana are doing it they're
opening stores all over the place these
guys in Florida are doing it like
there's none here it will work it's like
and it's just like I'm not listening to
someone that doesn't know what they're
talking about but if that guy was in the
industry and he had and he's like listen
man I know it looks good but here's
what's happening it's like okay I'm
going to listen to this guy yeah you
know yeah that's right that's um it's
funny because back to insurance the most
viral tweets I've ever had have always
been about some sort of business that
had an insurance component and I I
tweeted about a zipline business last
week and I was like and I I baited
people on purpose I was like tell me why
this wouldn't work Insurance liability
insurance what do you do about insurance
and my response is the same it's like
you buy insurance that's your solution
you pay for it and then I tweeted and
this lost me a few followers I said
insurance is the warm security blanket
that people use to never start
businesses it's like oh I can't there's
too much of a liability I shouldn't I

[29:01]
too much of a liability I shouldn't I
should it's like dude stop y yeah I I'm
probably unfortunately on the record too
many times and I've got buddies in both
these spaces so they've heard me say it
to their face so I can say it but I
think lawyers and insurance agents kill
deals right yeah and I think they both
have their place I think they're both
super important I think you need to
listen to wise counsel of both but man a
good attorney and a good insurance agent
will be like my buddy who's a awesome he
said Hey listen you're going to have to
pay for this we'll go find somebody that
rather than no you can't it's too crazy
or man that's like no Hey listen I'm I'm
with you I see the dream I see the
vision same with attorneys man you can
get you we listen sometimes to too many
of those voices and we in society we put
them on the a higher pedal because
they're lawyers they're Bankers I get
that but a lot of times man it's just
finding the right person that that goes
alongside you and says hey it's
hairbrain but I'll be right there with
you and if we get done we'll get it done
there's always someone for every deal
like there's always a way to make any
deal happen that's right so you're
talking about prices that was the

[30:01]
talking about prices that was the
central focal point of my tweet is how
do you not charge more and that's I'm
not like this isn't a softball to get
you to like sell yourself I'm genuinely
surprised how and why you don't charge
more than 25 bucks for two hours yeah
it's funny what's interesting is that
we've been actually debating your Tweet
in the office for a couple days the
psychology behind when you said $12 an
hour it's interesting because that's
true right like it's a two-hour minimum
you got to buy it's not how you it's not
how you frame it on your website it's
how I stated it that's right that's
right but and both are true right and so
it was very interesting of like oh man I
like the way you said because what's
funny when you say that I get complaints
often about how we're too expensive and
here's so we did a lot of Market studies
we did a lot of studies on the water
park beside us some other family farms
around us we felt like $24.99 was a good
deal for the average family for the
experience that we believe that we're
providing now I've got technically
competitors of mine that just opened up
a facility in Tennessee their kid price
is 55 bucks and their adult price is 70

[31:00]
is 55 bucks and their adult price is 70
bucks and now again different model they
want you there all day bigger food and
beverage bigger part totally different
model $24.99 Works in our model if I see
a certain amount of people annually
we're open 12 months a year so that
helps too we have other revenue streams
like field trips and birthday parties
that aren't just the $24.99 route some
are cheaper some are more expensive but
for us what's interesting is the thing
that gets held up we talk about
preconceived notions right the number
one complaint that we get at our park is
oh no no no no I don't need to pay I'm
just here for Timmy to do the rides
correct everybody that walks surate has
to buy a ticket well no no I'm just
gonna watch totally understand that you
have to buy a ticket the same would be
nobody would everybody would think
you're crazy if you went over to the
water park and you said Hey listen I'm
not gonna ride any water slides today
just Timmy's gonna do it but so I don't
need a ticket no you need a ticket yeah
same we try to tell you all the time
same with Children's Museums at a
children's museum at least the ones
around us
it's cheaper for the kid to go than it

[32:00]
it's cheaper for the kid to go than it
is the adult and I can assure you I'm
not doing those activities so it's
interesting that the psychology we give
some people like no no I don't think I
should have to pay I disagree with you
and so the you get that a lot oh weekly
yeah yeah yeah all the time okay that's
like a your number one complaint I would
I I would argue that is our number now
listen it's the summertime our number
one complaints about to be that it's hot
outside that's that's your fault I have
yet to figure out the solution to that
answer I know people always say just put
more shade I get it it's still hot in
Texas stand on shade how do you do that
how do you do that so that will become
our number one complaint here in in
about a week or two but consistent
complaint is I think it's ridiculous
that I had to pay and my son my kid just
did the the right huh okay so if a
grandma brings her grandson in it's it's
a $50 ticket price for you and you're
really only serving one of those people
in theory yes yeah okay that makes a
little tell people is nine out of 10
times the people that complain about I

[33:00]
times the people that complain about I
watch they end up getting on the
machines anyways and doing the rights
now they already they've already paid
for that right right that's right they
don't have to pay extra to get on the
machine correct that's the other thing
is we're not a nickel and dime operation
right that's other thing we didn't want
to be so that's why that 24 we thought
about hey you come in and every ride is
five bucks or you know we thought about
that we don't want you to think about it
when you come into our Park every you
can do this every everything you want a
hundred times I want you to do it a 100
times 24.99 for that the only things
that you would pay extra for is that
you're choosing you can purchase a gym
mining bag you can purchase food and
beverage you can purchase a retail item
all three of those though do not have to
be purchased to achieve the goal of
operating machinery and so those three
things are outside of the core of what
we're doing and so we feel fine charging
for that knowing that we can deliver the
full experience for $24.99 I didn't
realize you had a gem mining uh station
that's awesome my kids love that I think
it's such and you just buy the bags
somewhere else and that's right and I
all credit right there goes to my

[34:00]
all credit right there goes to my
business partner when we started again
NE none of us were in the theme park
space none of us knew really anything
and he went to a conference and he
called me and said Hey listen we're
gonna buy this and it was kind of the
I'm pulling the just trust me card yeah
it's an asymmetric bat right right and
so even when it showed up I was like
dude I I trust you but I don't get it
like I don't understand how this thing
even operates and I tell you what man
that thing is our number one you know I
mean it's obvious not our number one
generator of Revenue because that would
be just general outside of the that's it
dude I mean kids live over there dude
that's where my daughter wants to be
every time she comes here and so it's a
it's a good product I mean I do believe
it's a good product and you get good
things from it and kids are fascinated
by it but it's hilarious to watch well
it's because it plays on our human
nature like it's it's inherent in our
DNA that we're treasure Hunters we
always have been we want to explore and
find something and that will never go it
does create a wonder and awe right like
You' got this you know you got this pile
of dirt that all of a sudden you run
through water and all of a sudden appear
here it's just wonder and all sensation

[35:00]
here it's just wonder and all sensation
of it as well do you have any numbers on
what percentage of kids buy the gem
mining as well do any come just for the
gam mining it's a great question answer
your second question yes first one no
you talk about the beauties of startup
entrepreneurship is when you when you're
trying to piece together your right
systems and Technologies and tools the
company we were with on our Point of
Sales system was good was good enough
doesn't tell us enough data and so the
one we've just now switched to we can
start to get really granular like I can
pull your profile and know how much you
spent specifically on gym mining all
that kind of stuff so we're starting to
gather that data but I would have to
believe that is the majority of our
guests at least somebody in their party
gets a bag really the majority of your
guests yeah W again I that's me watching
it for two years anal behind that that's
correct that's correct that's surprising
that that's that must have really moved
the needle for you then it's a great
it's a great Revenue driver for sure
great call and you didn't even work that

[36:00]
great call and you didn't even work that
into your underwriting on day one right
that was just a cherry on top no truly
our underwriting literally Rick and I
wanted to make the model not work right
I I think that's important is figure out
what breaks the model right like overly
conservative overly conservative and
really our only Revenue line items were
General emission we thought we could
sell some field trips and we thought we
could maybe like food and beverage like
just kind of like a big bucket for that
that was really the main Revenue drivers
do you sell t-shirts or hats or anything
merch oh yeah yeah we got 1,200 foot
merch store another thing that people
some have it's always have a complaint I
force you out through the retail shop
like you have to exit the park that way
and so parents either love or hate me
for that yeah but we force you through
it's an indoor it's funny because like
it's indoor it's AC so you come out of
the heat right so you're L like let's
just stand here for a second and we sell
toys books hats shirts flashlights
backpacks you know your typical retail
items in there but unique B World things
is food and beverage a sizable line item
yeah it's a sizable line item you know

[37:01]
yeah it's a sizable line item you know
again we only want you here for two
hours that's what we need for our model
to keep people churning in and out so we
only sell prepackaged them so chips
candy bottled drinks ice cream that's
kind of something you have to sell right
like it people literally need to eat and
drink it's not like you really want to
make money on it that's right and I but
I don't want to get into the as of right
now at this part this location I don't
want to get in the hot dog business or
the hamburger business so that's right
we're going keep it simple and you can
go to Chick-fil-A when you leave here
and get food if you need it yeah there's
probably 13 within 10 minutes that's
exactly right okay so we got general
admission food and beverage merch gems
is there anything else so let's talk
about field trips I want to know like
how that plays into your Revenue how
that's priced and what the strategy is
there yeah so field trips uh for us
heavily discounted ticket for the kids
right it goes anywhere from $4 to $8 but
you're talking massive volum
right so you're talking big volume a
couple hundred kids at a time you're

[38:00]
couple hundred kids at a time you're
also talking about significant labor
decrease on my side right because you're
coming so during the school year our
park is only open Saturday and Sunday
we're open on certain holidays but for
the most part it's Saturday Sunday and
so the Park's closed Monday through
Friday and so you can come and do a
field trip on Tuesday morning at nine
o'clock and I only need to bring gosh
the T of our labor and so those are
great margin items for us and kids love
it right it's Unique it's totally
different the park shut down they
operate machines teachers love it
because we'll we do all the the quote
unquote babysitting right like we like
the kids are in in closed area they can
run wild so the teachers can just kick
back and relax and enjoy the park so
it's a good line aded for us I want it
to be significantly higher line at for
us that's one of the growth areas and
again so things you don't know till
you're in it right you start the
business you go man we're gonna be able
to sell field trips like
crazy yes is the problem is when you're
dealing with a school that's been around
for a while every first grader has a

[39:00]
for a while every first grader has a
first grade field trip every second
grade
has they've got tradition so I'm I have
to essentially convince you teacher to
go to your principal and change this
structure that's been in place for years
so it's one of those moments that like
hindsight were like oh yeah that's been
a little bit harder than we projected
but it's it's starting to become a
bigger and bigger line item for us yeah
well luckily you live in an area where
they're opening new schools like every
month and you can catch them early in
that tradition exactly right exactly
right I I chaperoned my eight-year-olds
field trip and they go to the Dallas Zoo
every year and he looks he's look
forward to that one field trip for years
and it'd be really hard to tell all the
kids and all the parents we're not doing
that anymore even if they're doing
something that might be better that's a
hard sell are you are you actively
trying to grow that or have they just
kind of come to you both so we have a a
greaters our team Chelsea she's actively
trying to grow those and we're actively
I'm reaching out to people trying to
figure out different ways in different
incentives get people to come but then a
lot of it is organic because we have a

[40:00]
lot of it is organic because we have a
lot of teachers that come to our park on
the weekend and we have signs everywhere
that talk about field trips and they go
oh this is what I want to do and so a
lot of it's organic but a lot of it we
go out there and hustle as well you
should listen you ever listen to how I
built this the podcast oh yeah oh yeah
all the time did did you ever hear the
one with the Chicken Salad Chick
founder so she awesome yeah that was
like maybe my favorite episode but she
grew in the early early days almost
exclusively by giving free food to
schools in their break rooms I feel like
you could totally do that you could get
like a little display with small
versions of your machinery and just and
buy them Panera or something I feel like
that would go a long way po strategy is
going in before major holidays Before
Christmas before spring break before
summer and we give the school tickets to
give to every first and second grader
for free right hey it's a free ticket to
to come because right right you're
banking on Park math right park math is
if one second grader comes the family of
four so I get three other tickets that

[41:01]
four so I get three other tickets that
weren't going to come but they saw this
free ticket to go and so we've been
different drivers like that definitely
help are you able to track any data on
like a kid that came for the first time
on a field trip and then came back with
his mom or grandma later now we will be
able to yes is that the whole idea with
field trips or do you want field trips
to stand alone as if none of the kids
come back you need to break a profit
both so so we definitely want
understanding that most kids will never
come come back but every field trip that
leaves we give them a free ticket to
come back and where the goal is there
they go home and talk non-stop to Mom or
Dad about how great it was and then they
bring the whole family on Saturday okay
what percentage of capacity would you
say you're at right now like if if for
the spot that you're in that one
location zero to 100% our attendance is
gone up every year and every year we
feel different pain points but then we
work through them to where it's like oh
okay that's not doing more so I would
say or I'll say it this way I ask the

[42:00]
say or I'll say it this way I ask the
question this way our Target would be to
see 45 to 50,000 guests this year total
annualized right I know we can handle up
to 75,000 pretty easily but so that I
would answer it that way that that kind
of helps yeah okay so do you think you
could see 100,000 at like Max Capacity
or would you have to open during the
week I think we need to open maybe like
on a Friday during the day to to help
for some of that and then I would need
to add a couple more machines for sure
yeah okay what about your staff how many
staff do you have how many are working
at any given time and what kind of roles
do you staff for yeah we have two
full-time people our general manager is
amazing and our events and coordinator
pers who is amazing and then we have
anywhere so in our system we employ
about like 55 to 60 people on a given
Saturday or Sunday anywhere from 18 to
25 will be here and those range from
just people that are our attractions all
the way to we have party coordinators

[43:00]
the way to we have party coordinators
that like Saturdays like tomorrow I
think we got like 10 birthday parties we
doing so we've got birthday party
coordinators that'll help facilitate
those we've got a lead over Admissions
and we've got our social media person
and so it falls in that 55 would be all
those jobs okay and then how many like
what's a really busy day look like as as
far as attendees you know a busy day I
would say we've gotten up to well okay a
good day if I look at the numbers I'm
like today was a good good day we're
north of 450 to 475 people busy day
we've had up to 800 people on one day
wow and then are you doing anything to
actively Market other than what you
already told me with the field trips or
are you just leaning on the mall for
stuff no quite the opposite the mall's
great they're a great partner great
landlord but I would actually again
another thing that we're trying to
quantify this year is how many people
went to the mall and then came to us I
don't think it's that high and so it's
more of we're just hammering the social
media right we're targeting mom we're
targeting people to try to who's making

[44:00]
targeting people to try to who's making
the weekend plans and Facebook and
Instagram that's it that's where we live
yeah interesting yeah it's the mall idea
as brilliant as it is you might have
gone into it thinking all right this is
going to drive a ton of our traffic and
then learned actually it's not but we
don't really need it because we lean on
social media so heavily yeah I would say
the nice the biggest value add of the
mall is what you said earlier we know
people are driving to this part of town
right so so therefore I'm not just way
out in the middle of nowhere banking
that like people will drive right
because people are creatures of habit
right some for some people driving 15
minutes is a far drive for houstonians
you drive 45 minutes to get to your
breakfast meeting you know kind of deal
so I would say that's where the mall
benefited us is we know people are
driving here so therefore they would
drive here to go to a theme park yeah
okay has there been like an unexpected
marketing channel that performed really
well like word of mouth or something
that's just really surprised you
as as obvious as it sounds and and I
would say we didn't probably weigh this

[45:01]
would say we didn't probably weigh this
enough when we started is influencer
brand engagement right paying people or
people that we do deals with that come
in here and post about us reaching out
to paid and unpaid that that has driven
most of our traffic interesting that
makes sense just the video of what you
do is so compelling for people to watch
sure yeah and I think that's the other
thing too right is I think this is with
any entrepreneur you get so used to your
product it loses is it Sizzle to you
sometimes right because it just is like
oh yeah that's what I do and oh yeah
it's so routine for me like yeah I can
put my four-year-old daughter on the
excavator let her drive it if you just
drop that normal conversation you're
like excuse me hold on back that up for
a second and so when you're right when
you just Captivate somebody go what did
I just see a kid driving a Skit Steer
yeah yeah it it helps spiral it out of
control in a good way yeah so if you
were to be able to go back in time what
would you have done differently from day
one that you can't really change today
if anything knowing what I think Rick
and I yeah I think Rick and I would tell

[46:01]
and I yeah I think Rick and I would tell
you the park layout we would we've
learned some things of like pinch points
of the park different lines that that we
didn't realize would be much longer than
some of the other attractions so I would
say a lot of just the the flow I think
we changed a little bit of the flow of
the things I'm not sure I would
fundamentally change a lot of what we
did I think we did a lot of ton of
research for few years right we had some
great friends that helped us a lot so I
think we we got to skip a lot of the
mistakes ear early on that we could have
made but I would say a lot of the I
would just say the design maybe would be
some of the things that changed okay so
with that in mind what's next for dig
world what are your world domination
plans if if you're listening to this
we'd love to hear from you you can email
us at info@ dworld tx.com you can find
our website we are very close to
starting to offer franchise
opportunities and by very close
definitely this calendar year and so
we'd love to find right partners that
that want to grow with us a great brand
across the country
we truly believe in our brand and
believe in our the hospitality and the

[47:01]
believe in our the hospitality and the
customer service that we're trying to
deliver and we're looking for good
people that want to grow alongside with
us and have that opportunity to own your
own business and do it in your own
community and so what's next for dig
world is growing franchises across the
country that's awesome yeah I could I I
think this is something I think the
whole experiential outdoor space is just
at its very very early days right the
more the world goes online the more
we're going to want to offset that by
stuff outside I think that we haven't
even seen the peak of that yet that's
right well that's all I got man I love
