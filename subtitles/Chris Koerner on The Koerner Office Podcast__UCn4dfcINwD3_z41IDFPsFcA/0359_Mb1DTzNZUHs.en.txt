welcome to the ker office I had a friend
of the Pod back on today Connor gross
he's been on at least two episodes so
far I know number 43 number 67 and maybe
something else I can't remember Connor's
an idea machine and I love his ideas and
I got so much energy from this chat with
Connor we had to split into two episodes
you'll hear the next one next week and I
promise you the next one's even better
than the one you're about to hear which
is awesome Connor's the guy that I
talked to about Grill cleaning and
programmatic SEO we talked about two
kind of core ideas and then some smaller
ideas within them one in like the time
track in space SL productivity space SL
how can I test to see if employees or
future employees work fast no one really
talks about that we talk about
productivity not being lazy being smart
working hard what about working fast and
then we talked about some ideas in the
candle space cuz Conor's dad owns a big
candle business in New Jersey so you're
going to love this one come back next
week for part two with Connor share it
with a friend we'll see you next
[Music]
time literally this week I get a call
from someone he's like I think my
employees and I'm I'm not going to say

[01:00]
employees and I'm I'm not going to say
his name at all so there's no
incriminating evidence I was like think
he's like I think my employee has two
jobs I was like well is he doing a good
job at work he's like yes I was like all
right well why do you think that he's
slow to respond he works remote I can't
find him on LinkedIn anymore so so I
also looked my like I think he just
deleted his LinkedIn profile and then I
got really suspicious so and keep in
mind I'm not saying my friend is sane
he's definitely a little crazy but he
said I looked up his house where where
he lives on payroll it's a 1.7 million
dollar house like I know how much this
guy makes it's not 1.7 and I was like
all right man well like first of all
people have trust funds people have Rich
spouses people get inheritance like you
know I wouldn't judge the house
situation but all I will say is that
he's not alone you know I've had three
people within the last probably three
months who have told me and they're all
entrepreneurial friends that they think
that their employee has a second job and
you know the the telltale signs can be

[02:00]
you know the the telltale signs can be
pretty easy obvious they're slow to
answer things you know maybe they screen
shared and a suspicious email or slack
popped up whatever they're not on
LinkedIn or maybe even worse they are on
LinkedIn but they don't list to your
company on LinkedIn like there's some
there's some things there in terms of
how to tell and it's
definitely it's it's something that
people would pay for but like even like
for myself right like I want to know I'm
not going to make my
employees download a Chrome extension or
slack extension or whatever to spy on
them like I'm just not that type of Boss
nor do I care enough at all but I would
want to know and so like what do this
more of a problem than it is a business
like how do you solve that like what
does that look like man I'm thinking
this is this is a little awkward to say
but I've had an employee in the past
that I hired on upwork and upwork is
very interesting because it will tell
you how many open jobs any employee has
at any given time any person on upw
workk right and so I have people that I

[03:01]
workk right and so I have people that I
currently employ on upwork that I can
see they have nine 10 13 open jobs now
big asterisk because a lot of times like
there are jobs that I opened years ago
that I never closed and technically on
their profile it says they still have an
open job with me so if it doesn't count
but there are ways you can tell and
that's you can see how many hours
they've worked on that job yeah so if I
see a job it will say open job with this
company since March
2021 you know 862 hours work I can do
the math and know wow this guy's doing
15 hours a week consistantly huh he's
doing 10 hours a week here he's doing
five here he's doing oh that's why he's
not answering my emails right but that's
just upwork right so upwork solves for
that for upwork but outside of upwork
where most of the world lives that is a
problem and so I'm over here thinking
like to to install a Chrome extension on
someone that you've already hired is

[04:00]
someone that you've already hired is
like there's just no going back from
that like you said right and you said
that it's like the it would just kill
the culture it kill the vibe just not
going to work but is there a way you
could do it
tactfully I'm a fan of like getting
ahead of things like for instance when I
hire someone at this point I just tell
them like hey I don't want to hop on
calls ever whereas if I tell someone
three months into the job hey I don't
want to hop on calls it's like wow you
don't like me it's like no it's not you
but if I tell them that up front then
they don't take offense yeah cuz it's
just now they know from day one and so I
wonder if there's a world where on day
one it's like hey this is what we do uh
you do have to install this Chrome
extension it sucks but this is a low-
margin business and like we we wouldn't
be in business if it weren't for this so
hope you know hope that's not a problem
and their response to that one throwaway
sentence is going to tell you everything
you need to know you might not even ever
have to you might not go through with
them or you might go through with them
and never even install it because you're
they're clearly not worried about it

[05:01]
they're clearly not worried about it
right it could just be like a litmus
test on the front end no so I I
completely agree with all of that have
also noticed the same thing with the
upwork stuff random story there that I
don't have to go into but I think that
it's probably more of a management solve
than it is maybe a product or a solution
now the only two because I spend some
time trying to prep for this and like
the only two solutions I could come up
with are so
Overkill that they wouldn't be good Sol
Solutions the first is invent an entire
sounds really stupid when I say it
invent an entirely new payroll processor
that tells you when one social security
number is on two payroll processors I
was thinking some sort of a centralized
database that companies could refer to
well so that's maybe so so this is ADP
it's Gusto whatever but like you know
ADP reports a lot of their payroll data
to the US government for like census and
job Bureau data now whether or not they
would report the number of double
payrolls I don't know that seems a
little bit

[06:00]
little bit
to micro and exposure
Focus the second idea is can you do a
glass door from employees I'm sure that
must have already been solved for before
but like yeah even in the back of my
mind like I have one employee for
reference that I'm thinking of just like
bad experience not going to get into a
lot of the specifics but like ended up
letting her go whole thing there I would
be really like I'm not going to reach
out when she gets a new job I hope she
gets a new job whatever but like I would
like the new employer to know what
happens or like I think that that's fair
and also myself as an employer like I
would want to know why somebody if
somebody had a bad experience and
they're just great on an interview but
then they become problematic and you
know I think that that could be an
interesting concept the tough part is is
that like probably over biases for bad
but I don't know ah it's tough It's it's
kind of like it reminds me of like the
there needs to be a review system for
Zilla for realtors or for homes right

[07:01]
Zilla for realtors or for homes right
like people that went on a walkth
through they could review hey avoid you
know don't waste your time I think a lot
of these problems are like you have such
a selection bias at play where it's like
the worst employees would never opt into
it and so you see like all these
employees magically have 4.9 rating you
know because they're pushing it and it
might not even mean they're good so then
it's not even working I wonder if the
bigger issue is more of a management
style like I'm just of the firm belief
that 80% of employees don't have enough
to do right I mean it's really the 8020
rule but it's like just go talk to
anyone and be honest with them I talked
to a guy last week that makees 350 grand
for Amazon and he's like I work 12 hours
a week like Max and my performance
reports are amazing and my boss loves me
and I keep getting promotions and like I
think that's a lot more common than
people realize yeah yeah I completely
agree I think it'll be interesting to
see how it shakes out in the next couple
years but may maybe the solution I think
I think what you got at originally is

[08:01]
I think what you got at originally is
expectations upfront probably also
hiring less right like that way yeah you
would know if they're not doing the work
I also do think like even our employees
right now like I don't think they
necessarily have a ton to do it's
November right now like we're we're
finishing out the year but yeah I I
agree with that so probably more of a
management solution than a true viable
business which I kind of felt like
coming in but I like breaking down the
problems when I hear them yeah well no
let me take your management solution and
turn it into what could be a viable
business I think there needs to be a
test some you know they have like
personality test right are you INTP or
ENFJ or introvert or extrovert or you're
blue or red or whatever there needs to
be an a test for employers to give to
impending employees to take that can
gauge and measure how fast they work
right that's something I never hear
people talk about you talk about is are
they productive are they not are they
lazy are they hardworking but no one
talks about how fast you can work right
how quickly you can rip through a

[09:00]
how quickly you can rip through a
spreadsheet or rip through an email like
you probably have experienced this I
have a friend named Brandon he's
experienced this where you know
Parkinson's law is very real thing for
those listening if you don't know what
it is it's like worktime expands or
contracts to fit how whatever you give
to it so if you're in high school and
you have four weeks to do your science
fair project you're going to do it in
four weeks if you have to do it tomorrow
you're going to do it by tomorrow like I
am such a believer in Parkinson's law so
if I had this standardized test that I
could give to employees during the
interview process before they're hired
that sent them through like it it gave
them like a faux inbox and it's like all
right clear the inbox hit inbox zero go
to this spreadsheet you know basic task
basic formula clear this solve for this
and it was like you just had a barometer
of what is a fast employee and what is a
slow employee because that way like I
can hire four of those guys yeah uh to
or I can hire one guy to fill four roles
if he's that fast because it really is

[10:01]
if he's that fast because it really is
an 8020 rule I just oh man like it's ma
it's maddening sometimes when I
Outsource something and it's like are
you done yet no I'm still yeah I I think
that that is one of the best ideas I've
heard in a minute solely because I think
it's easy to build and if you
aggressively give it out for free SL
whatever the referrals that come in from
it assuming that it's like qualified and
good would be great so I mean you know
that I'm working on this recruiting
business right now and like don't have
to go into that a ton all I want to say
is that we recently hired us-based
customer support roles for a fast
growing e-commerce business one of their
biggest criterias was type speed I think
I'm like f I think I'm nice on a
computer I think I'm like very very fast
in terms of typing um I took a typing
test that they want wanted me to
administer to all of their candidates
and I got like 75 words per minute they
want all of their candidates to be at
least 60 which okay you know your job

[11:00]
least 60 which okay you know your job
was responding to tickets it's a volume
game that makes sense it felt a little
weird to like administer to people after
the interview but like I was like that's
fine we got to the final round with like
five really good
applicants and I think it was like four
of the five I maybe it was three of the
five scored like 35 wordss a minute and
I was like wow I was like I wouldn't
even like I I thought I was fast and you
know at some point it gets marginal and
like 60 felt right to me
but like I was like wow you can't use a
computer I was like I didn't like call
me privilege is fine but like we had you
know typing test stuff in like the the
fourth fifth grade old Hardware PCS like
to your point on hey whether or not it's
a screening and a criteria to join like
the typing speed honestly might to your
point or learning keyboard shortcuts or
and maybe that's a training when they
joy in or whatever like whatever that
looks like I do think think that that
would be really really valuable for a

[12:01]
would be really really valuable for a
lot of new hires yeah or dude even like
I use this Mac app it's called I think
you would like this it's called word
counter I think word it's this this one
solo founder built it like a decade ago
he's the only guy and it's the only app
that I could find that does this it's
like $20 for a lifetime license and it
tracks how many words you type per day
across mail messages Excel slack Chrome
whatever whatever app individually or in
Aggregate and it was shocking for me to
realize how many words I'm typing I
yesterday was like my all-time high for
the last four months I typed 6,800 words
yesterday damn
6,800 but it's like that that's
Parkinson's law you just take on all
these companies and projects and
employees and then you just you you rip
through it so much faster you're like
I'm not going to put an email signature
here I'm not going to use pleasantries
I'm not going to I'm not going to add
that period That's a typo people are
going to think I'm dumb I don't care I'm

[13:00]
going to think I'm dumb I don't care I'm
GNA I'm going leave all the typos
because what do I care that they think
I'm dumb no I'm going to rip through
these emails like took me 15 years to
get there but if if you could see how
many words someone in a role where that
is correlated to productivity just
you're not taking screenshots you're not
checking in I think that would that
would give you that gets you a lot of
the way there I completely agree that's
cool I like that a lot really like that
and to your point this was your idea
like you make this free because you want
this this to become the deao standard
you want all these companies to start
using it right like introvert and
extrovert is household word like I want
whatever X Y or Z household word that's
related to this test to become
commonplace because then I mean your
monetization angles are endless at that
point there are a lot of paid ones right
like the paid ones are is it predictive
IQ or I don't know it's there there're
if you look up like employee personality
tests or something like that ahead of
time predictive index maybe it's called

[14:00]
time predictive index maybe it's called
there are a lot of paid ones I do think
to your point can you get a more free
version of this and then upsell
something else afterwards gets
moreing dude and honestly like I would
administer this test as an employer as
just like I wouldn't tell them it it
we're measuring their productivity or
their speed I would just say like hey
this is like a it's a trial run and
we're going to pay you for it right
we'll pay you whatever your normal rate
would be and it's just so you can kind
of get a feel for how we work and then
you give me feedback when you're done on
what you thought yeah and so it's like
oh you're getting feedback it's kind of
a trick then at the end of it you're
seeing all these metrics that they don't
even know that you're tracking you know
100% cool I like it that's cool me too
you could use AI to build that like hey
here's what I'm thinking what should I
like how should I use zapier like how do
I fill a faux inbox like what type of
excel formulas should I use like it
should be like kind of skillful but not
really little
sandbox yeah it's yeah

[15:02]
sandbox yeah it's yeah
exactly that's good I like that one all
right if you are watching this clip
right now you are watching this on
YouTube and if you are a fan of podcast

at it because sometimes I have podcasts
that aren't on YouTube and sometimes I
have YouTubes that aren't on podcast so

platform or you can go to TKO pod.com
also my newsletter will throw that in
there there are no ads It's weekly it's
different content than my podcast and
YouTube newsletter. chrisj cerner.com
You'll see the link and we'll see there
my dad all my life like I think in ' 08
he bought this business back when I was
11 and I didn't know what like buying a
business was or anything there bought a
candle manufacturing business in South
Jersey spent the Summers scraping wax
off glass selling candles making cold
calls to Mom and Pop shops and you know
now he's owned this business now what is
it math on this 15 years something like
that and
he probably is going to sell it soon
he's grown the business pretty Siz all
under the own brand but the

[16:01]
under the own brand but the
entrepreneurial director consumer
e-commerce brain in me is always
thinking damn how can I launch a bunch
of sub candle Brands and to be honest
with you like his candle brands are not
super unique from anyone else it's just
they have his 15 years plus the previous
owners 15 years you know they got 30
years in the industry of selling candles
so they've built a little bit of a brand
for themselves but I feel like it would
be really fun to Launch like the liquid
dep of candles and start with I don't
know what that looks like but like the
classic Candle Company and candle Decor
is everything from oh fall baked goods
crisp cotton you know some kind of like
luscious smell and and and fragrance
nobody wants their things to smell bad
so I think that's kind of off the table
it's kind of more of a gag gift but like
can you create really intense
branding that can appeal to a different
audience and get a lot of headlines what

[17:00]
audience and get a lot of headlines what
do you think what about like a like a
mystery candle where it's not going to
be it's not going to be something bad
but it's going to be something random
and you could even you could even put
them in themes like a like a wood chop
mystery candle and it might smell like
Cedar It might smell like Pine or
sawdust or something or just like a a
man cave theme mystery candle and it
could smell like motor oil or just
something I don't know what it is this
is kind of random but there's a a small
percentage of the population that
genuinely likes the smell of skunk
myself included like I we drive by a
skunk and like my whole family is like
oh gosh roll up the windows and I
genuinely love it like that's okay so
that's weird maybe there's it is weird
but maybe there's something there you
know that there's a subreddit for people
like you I'm sure probably yeah but so
okay so one thing I can think of is like
Drive coffee I don't know if you know
this company but they do really cool
packaging design so they kind of this
weird over like intersection of people
who love classic cars classic adventure

[18:00]
who love classic cars classic adventure
whatever is the brand and the people who
enjoy their coffee they sell coffee
beans in motor oil cans with like really
sexy package that could be cool but as
far as like what you're saying too the
candle Market is pretty segmented in
terms of like gag gifts which is like
the surprise I know that there are
candle companies that do like hide a
diamond ring in one out of every 50,000
candles that they love that con and then
the other side is like the Cozy in home
right like candle sales plummet in the
summertime but they perform really well
in the winter fall time obviously um one
thing that most people don't know about
with the candle industry is
that big players like Yankee will often
you make candles in two batches you pour
the wax you let it sit you adjust the
Wicks you then reheat it that way it's
all straight and then you pour the top
layer of wax as well that way you're not
just like dousing a candle wick in wax
that's how the manufacturing Works in

[19:00]
that's how the manufacturing Works in
that second portion of wax Yankee and a
lot of the big guys is where they put
all of their fragrance so when you're at
a store and you're smelling it you're
sniffing it it smells really fragrance
because the fragrance is the expensive
thing not the wax here right you could
probably it's topheavy top it's a
topheavy candle yeah you like you could
probably have a pretty good marketing
campaign I've been pushing my dad to do
this for a while of just emphasizing the
difference in educating the customers on
that for difference I think that that
would be really valuable and something
that you can kind of like create an
enemy out of which would be nice your
dad isn't direct consumer already he's
only doing like Wholesale white label
stuff no they they're like a third a
third a third it's third Amazon third
it's probably more like 30% Amazon 15%
direct to Consumer and then whatever the
Delta is a 55 wholesale okay and is he
doing anything unique right now or is it
just kind of your generic stuff pretty
generic like I if he's listening to this
which I doubt is you know it's it's a

[20:00]
which I doubt is you know it's it's a
great candle it's a great product you
know I will say and he's strayed away
from this a little bit but honest and
partially because like this is also a
little saturated they had a very
Christian Catholic emphasis when they
bought the business since then it's
slightly watered down they don't lean
into that that hard like if you looked
at the brand you wouldn't necessarily
know it unless like you've known it for
20 years um so they they have moved away
from that a little bit I do think if
they went super hard in that category
where it's like hey every candle has a
like a testament quote at the bottom and
you see it after you burn all the wax
maybe there's something there but
honestly I think above all else if
you're if you want to call it the liquid
death of candles what did the liquid
death do differently all right they took
a really boring category and they made
it pretty extreme pretty counterculture
and then they also changed the packaging
almost no water bottles were in aluminum
cans prior to this so when you think of

[21:00]
cans prior to this so when you think of
a candle the first thing that comes to
mind is probably some kind of glass
packaging or maybe there's some kind of
like ceramic looking thing that you can
buy on Amazon some kind of votive jars
as well but like for the most part It's
All Glass and so you see the wax can you
redesign the packaging to make it look
like another piece of Home Decor within
your house or do you want to have it be
designed entirely for one room right do
you want to sell bathroom candles
therefore do you make it white and
Porcelain like the toilet do you want to
only sell candles for the outdoors do
you want to only sell candles to go by
like your fireplace like thck the vessel
that probably has the
highest T and can like also stand out
and differentiate from the last products
and then I think you just have to go
really extreme in the marketing and so
what does that look like it's is it you
know do you take the liquid death like
crazy Rockstar Punk culture approach
probably not
but can you do like oh one would be a

[22:01]
but can you do like oh one would be a
really good one and I've actually oh God
I thought about this for a while do you
know 19 crimes No 19 crimes is a wine
company if you look up their bottles
online they're awesome it's like a black
and white photo of a prisoner in front
of a cell and they like if you hover
like an app over the over the bottle it
like kind of animates it it's like I was
arrested for this X Y andz reasons and
so it's pretty cool I've always wanted
him to do something similar and if you
think about the type of people that are
buying candles it's can also be like the
romcom and they really like fiction and
like can you cross over that world with
the candle world at all where there's
some kind of story involved or there's
characters that you like really enjoy
you know something like that I wonder if
you could take what about the concept of
a refillable candle and I know there's
some weirdness with the wick but I think
you could do it right where you put
something on top of the The Vessel to
hold the wick in place like
what if he found some popular Shopify

[23:01]
what if he found some popular Shopify
stores or even like a HomeGoods or Hobby
Lobby that sells some sort of a
decoration or a vase and like on Shopify
if you put some like a URL suffix you
can sort all of their products by Best
Sellers right so basically just find
some sort of a HomeGoods decoration
that's already like top 1% best sellers
copy the design somehow and then sell a
candle inside that with like a
subscription where you could order the
wax in the future and you'd have to melt
it down but like refill it over time so
it's a permanent fixture that is always
a candle that you could always refill so
they have melters melters are basically
nightstand looking things um or they
don't have to be nightstands but they're
night stands there's also ones that you
can plug in and you just put the wax
specifically on top it burns it off that
can absolutely work and maybe the entire
game plan is hey we don't want to have
something that we light we want to have
something that casts a stronger
fragrance I like that idea I I think the
vessel is the big question here right

[24:00]
vessel is the big question here right
because like in the same way that
they're selling aluminum cans versus
plastic what do you
sell maybe it's the opposite too maybe
you down sell it maybe you sell them
without the vessel and then there's just
a plate that collects all the wax that
might get messy I don't know more
broadly speaking I like the concept of
liquid death for X like that needs to be
a thing I think liquid death worked so
well because a the founder I forget his
name is a freaking marketing genius
right
B it's water right so you can make water
punk rock and you're not going to really
alienate a a market right if you sell
something that everyone needs you can go
as niche as you want and it can become
over time as broad as you want whereas
with candles you know it's going to be
hard to convince a dude that doesn't
normally buy candles to buy candles
right so maybe maybe that's the ammo as
well right like you know I think you see
a lot of people raise VC money and
they'll go after the hey want to make a
men's makeup brand I think some one of

[25:00]
men's makeup brand I think some one of
them just recently went under went under
it's like hey men men don't want to wear
makeup but from a candle standpoint
right I do think that you could probably
have more of a crossover if it's like oh
this candle helps you focus oh this
candle you know can give the illusion to
your messy apartment when you bring a
girl over that like it's actually not so
bad stuff like that the other thing to
really Sol for specifically candles just
throwing this out there is like hard as
hell to sell online people want to smell
it and and so yeah I don't really know
the the answer for that like is it you
send a little sample
pack the the last thing I would say on
the liquid death forx category I have a
I have a friend whose friend started a
business and I freaking love it it's
called Titan caskets and Titan caskets
is essentially the liquid death for
caskets so they take a very you know
when people die and I just did this
whole write up on like funeral homes and
if they're a good business or whatever
like people are very much of caregivers

[26:00]
like people are very much of caregivers
and they want to be there for you and
and whatever the Titan casket is like
they ran a Valentine's Day special
called buy now die later and like
they're they're very aggressive in terms
of their marketing they take a really
cool fun approach and it's it's like
irreverent marketing it's all irreverent
like that's probably the best word for
it exactly and it's and it's on a
category that you would never think of
but crazy high aov right like you know
these eight n $10,000 caskets I'm
looking at the website right now like
they're like punk rock they got like
stickers on them like it looks like the
back of my Jeep in high school yeah they
and they also just did a whole they made
the casket I don't know if you saw this
or not for the yeti and liquid death
collab so Yeti and liquid death raffled
off a casket for like 70
80,000 and they manufactured the casket
that essentially looked like a Yeti
cooler as a casket and they filled it up
with liquid death and ice and whatever
wow yeah that's random
but that's awesome but pretty cool yes

[27:01]
but that's awesome but pretty cool yes
so I I think the liquid death for X
category you have to be good at
marketing pick a big Tam and then find
something that also has to serve a
little bit more of a a problem right
like in in liquid death case the kind of
problem that they were solving was I
want to drink water at a concert without
looking like a wuss and yeah that you
know it's oh is he holding a Miller
Light I can't tell and I do think that
you finding something like that could be
very beneficial dude I'll also say the
the mango chainsaw liquid death is the
best sparkling water on the planet it is
so good hard disagree I would I would
love I would hey big sparkling water guy
over here love the topa chicos I'm a
mountain valley Guy usually through and
through but like the mango one I think
it's too sweet for me I think is what it
is that's why I like it yeah I bought
one I think they were selling it at like
a Chipotle in on Austin one time or
something like that and yeah a little
bit too sweet for me dude I just got an

[28:00]
bit too sweet for me dude I just got an
idea I just got an idea okay I'm sitting
up so I'm over here thinking we're
having like this you know the front
brain in my conversation is conversing
with you the back brain the back of my
brain is just thinking like the smooth
brain is just thinking candle ideas
right and so I'm thinking you mentioned
smell how do you sell a smell over the
Internet well it's hard can you send out
samples then I started thinking Direct
Mail you know could you do like a
scratch of sniff direct mail and it's
like that could be interesting on like a
postcard you could put 12 different s
samples I'm obsessed with this one QR
code right here you order from your
phone Apple pay friction list love it
right especially if it's a subscription
because Direct Mail is expensive right
this would be even more expensive I I
presume putting smells on something but
if it were a subscription you know your
aov could be in the hundreds so that's
interesting but then I'm thinking okay
what about little co-marketing what
about finding companies that are already
spending a bunch of money on Direct Mail
the zillions them that's the only thing
I get in my mailbox let's say it's a

[29:00]
I get in my mailbox let's say it's a
like a nationwide like Century 21 or
someone that has a really big Direct
Mail budget and doing a co-branding
campaign with them and say hey just give
me like the the left third of your
envelope or if you're spending 36 cents
per envelope for a 4x6 and it's 41 cents
for a 5x7 let me just you know you only
need 4x6 let me get the rest I'll pay
you a couple pennies I save 80% you're
you net out ahead or even or make up you
know make a little more money and I'm
going to put these samples on everything
I think it would work yeah honestly I
have not even thought about the concept
of a scratch and sniff in the longest
time but I 100% do think that it would
work I also think that it would work
from a gifting time if you want to put
it in a bunch of just like cataloges and
Q4 gifts because that's when a ton of
mail goes out as well I do think that
that would especially because that's
when that intent is highest dude SN we
got to bring snatch scratch and sniff
back like it's it's physical it's it's
like it has the the the first principles

[30:02]
like it has the the the first principles
of like you're revealing something what
is it going to be so the other thing
that if you want to I I've liked this
idea I'm I'm so deep in the candle world
at this point and I haven't really
thought about it honestly in a while so
um it's called birth dat candles
birthd you know about this I think so
John for your TS
company oh wow their site has changed a
little bit since I've been last ah I
don't think I do know about this there's
one there was like a HomeTown candles do
you remember them no oh oh yeah that
that's called
homesick oh homesick is great yeah
homesick decom they were all over
Facebook homesick crushes homesick does
a really good job and I think they do
like you know it's they're right now
they're selling a Jerry's apartment in
Yankee Stadium fragrance and you know
Barbie dream housee like they crush it
on the partnership cabs everything's
awesome the birth dat ones they target

[31:00]
awesome the birth dat ones they target
people who are into horoscopes
horoscopes so like I can send you a
birth a candle for your birthday and the
fragrances I think are like one of three
but on the front it says like June 23d
Pisces here's what your sign tells me
about you all of this stuff actually
damn not gonna lie their site changed a
lot since I've been on it last but it's
probably merchandised 10 times better
the birth date pendant this is crazy 100
85 oh my God are you are you on this
website right now yeah I'm looking at it
y birthday pendant this has got to be an
expensive website they definitely very
interesting though so yeah lots doing
the candle space if okay here's here is
a followup on this I have the in on the
manufacturing front all right if anyone
knows has a candle idea let me know down
down to playball the very last one that
I'll say is that the only thing people
love more than you know friends and
gifts for birthdays is their pets and so

[32:01]
gifts for birthdays is their pets and so
the last thing I'll say is can you have
a fragrance that maybe isn't wet dog but
smells better than that like freshly
groomed dog and then you send me a photo
of your dog and I print floofy on the
front of a candle and you have it as
that would go over really well too oh
dude yeah or that just more speaking
more broadly like incorporate pets with
anything CU pets is a standalone
industry everyone knows is amazing but
just a pet collab with any consumer
package good yeah I like really
interesting programmatic SEO on homes of
candles one for every Niche town in
America that could be a thing I know I I
know You' like that one I thought you
were joking but I'm like no this sounds
like a good idea
Connor the most nich Niche ideas of all
time but I like
it geez even programmatic aside like if
you were just doing like hyper targeted
Google ads to people in those areas or

[33:02]
Google ads to people in those areas or
people that used to live in those areas
but now live in somewhere else yeah I
like it all right that's good okay don't
forget to come back next week I promised
part two is even better than part one
please subscribe on Apple or Spotify or
wherever you are and share this with a
friend
