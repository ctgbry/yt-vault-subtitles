look at this freaking thing right here
two Frameworks I need you to pull away
from this video and you're going to love
them both this is day seven of showing
you my favorite business ideas for 2025
so follow for more number one in any
Market in any industry there's a company
with the highest price and the lowest
price everyone competes to be the lowest
price no one competes to be the highest
price it sounds stupid but it's not
Ultra Premium commands respect if
nothing else because of the price tag
it's called confirmation bias when they
see the price tag they go into it
thinking oh wow oh this must be pretty
nice and then self fulfilling prophecy
whatever you want to call it they're
going to see the luxury in the item and
you're setting the tone of that when you
set the price second framework sell to
businesses not to individuals you know
how much this table cost
$30,000 why because a construction
company had $30,000 to spend on a stupid
conference table and they did and then
this video got millions of views and
they're going to sell a bunch more of
them try to be the highest price try to
sell the businesses and you'll win get
all my business ideas right here
