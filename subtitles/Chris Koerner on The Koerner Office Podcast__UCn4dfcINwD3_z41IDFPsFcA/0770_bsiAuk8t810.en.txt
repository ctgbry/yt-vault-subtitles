[00:00]
It is AG1 in a gummy. All it is.
Sometimes you hear ideas and you're
like, it's too easy. Of course, that
works. They launched [music] 3 years
ago. I'm fairly confident it's 500
million in sales.
&gt;&gt; Oh my gosh, dude. That's a whole
industry. 500 million in 3 years tells
me way more demand than supply.
&gt;&gt; Take something that's already really
popular and just change the form factor
and it'll crush. OxyClean has done 5
billion [music] plus in sales at this
point. Big money industry. Very big
money. And so I think what you can do is
try to figure out what are the other
categories that you can put that in.
You're selling a very cheap thing for a
pretty high markup because you're
solving that embarrassment problem.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that is an amazing idea. It's a
no-brainer.
[music]
You may recognize Connor. He's been on
the pod five or six times. He lives here
in New York. So I flew to New York and
sat down with him to talk business
ideas. Please enjoy. So tell me what
you've been learning about Billy Mazize.
Man, Billy Mays, is he still alive?
&gt;&gt; No. RP Billy Mazize. Born out for Billy

[01:00]
&gt;&gt; No. RP Billy Mazize. Born out for Billy
Mays. Yeah, this guy made billions
basically. Long story short, you think
like the late night infomercial that
maybe like people's crazy cousins or
crazy uncles now watch these days, he
was the king of it. And what I wanted to
come into today's conversation with was
kind of understanding how he made so
much money and like what the top
products were. And like back then late
night infomercials were the way to sell
products is how you moved moved volume.
Now it's TCO, now it's meta ads and like
tik to tik tok search little geo stuff.
And so I was like, he's clearly selling
stuff that people wanted to buy.
&gt;&gt; How do you sell it again in a way that
is not on a TV and not using CTV
because, you know, the audience for that
has dwindled to a fraction of the size.
And so I started diving into some of the
top sellers. And do do you know what his
top sellers are? Have you done any
research here on this?
&gt;&gt; No. Was he the Flex Seal guy?
&gt;&gt; Yes. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. the the
well, we spray painted an entire boat.
It's like we put a screen door in the
bottom of this canoe.
&gt;&gt; Like what a visual hook on that
commercial.
&gt;&gt; It was classic direct response marketing

[02:01]
&gt;&gt; It was classic direct response marketing
like to the tea. And now I feel like you
have all these e-commerce guys who are
turning around and they're like we're
doing 45 minute long VSSLs and like we
are going after heavy hooks and all that
stuff and all they're doing is they're
just taking the stuff that worked in
direct response back in the 90s and
early 2000s and they're just putting it
on meta. And so what I thought was like
what were the categories and the
products that somebody who was as iconic
as Billy Mays was, what was he selling
and how can you then apply that to
social media and sell it again? And so
you remember the Flex Seal. Flex Seal is
iconic. Slap it on. It's like the
classic meme. But his number one
product, any guesses? Do you know any
categories?
&gt;&gt; I saw your tweet, so I'm going to act.
&gt;&gt; It's not that.
&gt;&gt; Oh, really? Okay. So your tweet was
about Reptissery Chicken.
&gt;&gt; So that was not him, I don't think.
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I don't even remember his
products. Like what? Let's do this.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Tell me all of his products and I'll try
to guess the more successful ones.
&gt;&gt; You're gonna know when I say it. So it's
it's OxyClean.
&gt;&gt; Oh, he was OxyClean.
&gt;&gt; He was OxyClean. Okay.
&gt;&gt; And OxyClean has done five billion plus

[03:00]
&gt;&gt; And OxyClean has done five billion plus
in sales at this point. So like simple
&gt;&gt; idea of what OxyClean is, stain remover.
Now they have it more in a spray. Before
it was like this little tub. You would
scoop out this powder. You put it on the
shirt. You'd kind of like rub it in a
little bit and you toss the shirt in the
wash. And so OxyClean was one of the top
categories. You look at all of the other
products. It's bathroom cleaners. It's
like a glue that was remodeled to like
fix up seams of jeans and like if your
couch cushion split like it's a fabric
uh sealant. You have like hardwood floor
like cleaner stuff like that. So, it's
all home products, all consumables, and
the type of thing that like has some
unique level of form factor on it, and
something that you are going to use time
and time again once you build up that
habit. And so, I'm working with a lot of
DC brands right now. I think you know
this. And I'm seeing the best people
that are consistently crushing it today
have very small tweaks on form factor
and then very good direct response
marketing. And so like classic example

[04:00]
marketing. And so like classic example
that everyone's talking about in the
news today is Grun. You know Grun's like
the the vitamin gummy.
&gt;&gt; No, I don't.
&gt;&gt; You haven't seen them?
&gt;&gt; No. Grun.
&gt;&gt; Gru with like the little two dots on
top. NS.
&gt;&gt; It is athletic greens. You know athletic
greens.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; It's AG1.
&gt;&gt; AG1. It is AG1 in a gummy.
&gt;&gt; All it is.
&gt;&gt; Sometimes you hear ideas and you're like
it's too easy. Of course that works.
They launched three years ago, which
someone who's watching this on the
internet is going to misquote or tell me
the exact numbers. I'm fairly confident
it's 500 million in sales. Three years
ago,
&gt;&gt; just think if we were sitting here a
thousand days ago.
&gt;&gt; Oh my gosh, dude. That's a whole
industry. It's like XYZ in a gummy.
Yeah, we saw confidence in a gummy. Y
&gt;&gt; we [laughter]
what wouldn't work in a gummy? So, I
think this is where I think you can
literally come up with a laundry list of
ideas of things that would work is take
something that's already really popular
and just change the form factor. So, you
have this massive TAM novel version of

[05:00]
have this massive TAM novel version of
doing it and then go direct response and
it'll crush. The other example, also a
very big business. Have you heard of a
company called Starface?
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Uh, you have a daughter, right?
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; How old is your daughter?
&gt;&gt; 13.
&gt;&gt; She'll probably start using Starface,
too. I'm guessing it's like it is a
pimple patch thing. Have you seen this
at all? No. No. So,
&gt;&gt; massive category, Proactive, Neutrogena,
whatever. Like, all these skincare
brands for blemishes. Normally, that was
how when I was growing up, you clean
your face and I guess people still clean
their face, whatever.
&gt;&gt; But now, if you have a pimple, you can
have acne and it's on your face. The
trendy thing to do is get a sticker, a
star, and you put it on your face
&gt;&gt; like in public.
&gt;&gt; In public.
&gt;&gt; Wow. So like what Alex Hermosi is doing
with his no strip?
&gt;&gt; That is perfect analogy. Yes. So like
before wearing a nose strip out in
public. Weird thing to do.
&gt;&gt; Nelly. Remember Nelly with a band-aid?
That was before your time.
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah. The rapper.
&gt;&gt; Would you just always wear a band-aid?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean he only wore a band-aid for
now. Nothing. That was his brand. He put
a band-aid right here.

[06:00]
a band-aid right here.
&gt;&gt; Not even hiding like a little teardrop
tattoo or anything? No.
&gt;&gt; That was just his trademark was the
band-aid on the face.
&gt;&gt; So this is something that's trendy.
Starface big company. And they basically
said people have acne. It's a big
category. We're not gonna try to fix it
at its root cause. We're going to try to
give you a stylish way to hide it. And
so, I feel like the main idea that I
came in here with that I've been I know
I'm on short notice, so I try to spin up
some stuff quickly
&gt;&gt; was like with this OxyClean to bring it
full circle.
&gt;&gt; It's a not great form factor. Now, they
have spray. So, I I will be the first to
admit it's a slightly better form
factor, but like they have the tie to go
sticks. They have the spray.
&gt;&gt; Do they do the magic erasers? Is that
OxyClean?
&gt;&gt; I don't know. They might. They probably
probably like one of these big unilver
proctor types of brands at this point.
&gt;&gt; I'm thinking though, could you do this
in a sticker? And I'm thinking like
dad's wallets, mom's purses. You're out
to eat.
&gt;&gt; Rather than having, you know, something
that's this big that's kind of like a
wand or magic race or whatever. Can you
have something that like hides in your

[07:00]
have something that like hides in your
in your wallet,
&gt;&gt; you pull it out, you peel it, you stick
it on the stain, and it releases
something instantly that just stays on
the shirt? Believe it or not, just
because you're watching this doesn't
mean you're subscribed to my channel.
YouTube's going to show you stuff even
if you're not subscribed to it. Over
half of people that watch my videos are
not subscribed. It would mean the world
to me if you just hit subscribe. Thank
you so much.
&gt;&gt; Oh, okay. So, like a stain remover
sticker.
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; Interesting.
&gt;&gt; And it can be different colors. You
know, obviously I'm assuming white's
going to be the most popular to kind of
blend in with the shirt or whatever. But
maybe there's something out there around
like it has to stay on it longer,
therefore the sticker is better or like
you don't want to be walking around with
a wet shirt or I don't know. Like do you
want to be walking around with a
sticker? I don't know. But if you can
make it cool if it's like a little kid
and he's getting food all over your
stuff, you put a dinosaur sticker on and
you know that's going to clean it.
&gt;&gt; So for clothes specifically,
&gt;&gt; that's my thought to I think that makes
more sense than like carpet
&gt;&gt; definitely
&gt;&gt; because there's not enough like surface
area to I don't know. I'm thinking like
you walk around though with like a Power
Rang I don't know if Power Rangers are
still cool. Uh like dinosaur stickers,

[08:00]
still cool. Uh like dinosaur stickers,
some kind of licensing, some Disney
things, Pokemon, and next thing you know
it's got like some kind of sticky
residue on the outside with a cleaning
residue on the inside. Put it on a
shirt. I think that could work really
well.
&gt;&gt; That is an amazing idea.
&gt;&gt; Nice. Sorry.
&gt;&gt; Because like first of all, it doesn't
have to work all that well
&gt;&gt; because that's not the problem you're
solving. You're you're solving
embarrassment. the parent kid doesn't
care, right? If I'm out with my kids and
they get a big stain on their shirt and
we're about to go somewhere nice, it is
what it is. They're kids. But if I could
have a solution to that problem, I would
buy it. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Right. And if I could know as a bonus,
it's going to help that stain come out
when you do throw it in the wash, it's a
no-brainer. And it's consumable.
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; So, you buy more and more of them.
&gt;&gt; Buy a pack of them. You're selling a
very cheap thing for a pretty high
markup because you're solving that
embarrassment problem.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. That's really interesting. I want
to know more about Starface. like do you
know where what their founding story is
or
&gt;&gt; so I think the CEO does a lot of these
beauty products and is has really good
retail connections and so I think

[09:00]
retail connections and so I think
they've gone a little bit of a different
way rather than going traditionally DTOC
but I know that they've scaled up fast
in just a couple of years time and like
I think culturally they've really
defined a lot of stuff
&gt;&gt; are they in stores or is it just
&gt;&gt; yeah no I think it's like it's Ulta
targets all that all that stuff
&gt;&gt; are boys wearing them
&gt;&gt; I'm not wearing them
&gt;&gt; but like is it a thing just for girls or
are both genders wearing it
&gt;&gt; I've seen guys wear them
&gt;&gt; really. Even in your 20s, 30s, people
wear them.
&gt;&gt; I think it's one of those things where
like you're in a city like New York,
you're going to have a lot of people
wearing them. Like I'm I'm trying to
think like you go to like raves or like
if you go to like big music festivals,
this stuff is done all the time. I think
it's something that like would you would
I wear it to work? Absolutely not. Would
the average creative [clears throat]
maybe.
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Like I think middle school, early
high school, those are a lot more like
kind of the target markets and like the
early times. See, I would think that
draws more attention to a pimple.
&gt;&gt; It definitely does, but it's not a
pimple anymore.
&gt;&gt; Do they tell people what it is or why
they're using it?
&gt;&gt; I think people know. I think people know
at this point. And honestly, like I

[10:00]
at this point. And honestly, like I
didn't know. And then as soon as I heard
it, like I bet I don't know if it's as
blatant as like you're going to walk to
the go to the airport after this and see
them, but like you'll start seeing them
pop up in your life. And what I would
have originally attributed to, oh, maybe
someone's going to a concert or they're
doing some special event later. I'm now
realizing is, oh, no, they're just
they're going to the library. They're
going to the supermarket and they just
have this cover up on. Um, and it's that
simple.
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; Do you know how they grew? Was it just
Facebook ads?
&gt;&gt; I think retail. I think a lot of retail
connections, which is interesting. It's
like you have a lot of these different
buyers once you form a connection with
them in one category. Like, you know,
you have Target, you have Walmart, you
have Ulta, you have Sephora. I think so
far as a part of Ulta once you get
connected with like the health and
wellness buyer or the beauty buyer or
the whatever buyer then that's your
channel right and so now it's it is let
me sell as much as possible and make
sure that the product is good but now
let me get more products to also sell to
you because now I can fill up more
shelves and I talk to them and I say hey
what's your worst product on this
category in the let's say we're talking

[11:01]
category in the let's say we're talking
supplements like what is your worst are
you guys moving a lot of torine today
are you guys moving a lot of creatine
today oh we're moving a ton of creatine
Okay, like what can we do to get another
product in there that's a
differentiator? Oh, we've been talking
with our buying team and like people
want to see creatine with caffeine.
Great.
&gt;&gt; I'm going to work on that. I'll get back
to you in 6 months. And you build up
those relationships really strong.
&gt;&gt; What if people not put in a gummy yet?
What's left out there?
&gt;&gt; That's the ultimate question. There's
caffeine. There's there's every there's
every uh health one, right? Like I don't
know if you ever took like the
Flintstone gummies growing up, but like
that was a staple. I think what you will
have to do is find the most annoying
form factor. And like the creatine
gummies have blown up. I'm sure you've
have you seen those.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh, yeah.
&gt;&gt; Those are great because creatine's
chalky and it's annoying to take. So
then you see goalie was the original
guys of it. And I think they did the
apple cider vinegar ones. But so green
juices, people want that. I think like
maybe like better magnesium gummies, but
these days gummies are
&gt;&gt; you're probably late on the gummy curve.
Yeah. At this point
&gt;&gt; when I hear $500 million in three years

[12:01]
&gt;&gt; when I hear $500 million in three years
with a gummy, I don't like I'm asking
the question to you, what other things
could you put in a gummy? But really
what the question is is like should
someone just go compete directly with
them
&gt;&gt; with grins?
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; I think they have a lot.
&gt;&gt; But like 500 million in three years
tells me way more demand than supply. A
little bit of a different angle or the
same angle. Just capture a little bit of
that.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, the other thing that they've
done that I think is really clever is if
you go to CVS and you go down the
vitamin aisle and you're looking at a
bunch of gummies, it is this big plastic
tub with 150 gummies in it and you pick
it off, whatever. What they've done,
which is really cool, is everything is a
travel pack. So, you get this big bag
and then within that bag,
environmentalist cover yours, there's
like 50 more little bags.
&gt;&gt; Oh, I hate that so much. [laughter]
Like, as a capitalist, I love it. As
someone who just doesn't want to waste
stuff, I hate it.
&gt;&gt; I get it. I get it. But it probably
increases consumption so much. Oh, yeah.
Because then you're traveling for a
week, you don't want to break that habit
and then you have to go grab a bunch.

[13:00]
and then you have to go grab a bunch.
So, I listened to the founder on a
podcast before and he talked about
&gt;&gt; how that packaging. No co-manufacturer
would do it for them. Like, they
literally had to go to every single one
of these co-ands and have them reinvent
one of their processes to figure out how
to get I don't know the exact number. I
think it's like seven or eight little
gummies into one sache and then put that
all those saches into one bigger sache
like bigger bag. So like that was that
was a lot of the innovation that had to
go in there.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean they wouldn't have done
that if they didn't think it would work.
&gt;&gt; Agreed. So I think if if the question is
what other gummies are going to work
just released an immunity one which is
different than I guess greens. It's like
you know your vitamin C stuff. I know
that sleep is a massive category that
gets talked about a lot these days. I
think that caffeine would be a really
interesting one as well.
&gt;&gt; What about custom gummies?
&gt;&gt; Talk to me. Like
&gt;&gt; what about you go to a fancy Shopify
site and there's a little form and you
say, "What do you want to optimize for?
Sleep, creatine, health, right?"
&gt;&gt; And maybe like on the back end there's

[14:00]
&gt;&gt; And maybe like on the back end there's
like 20 different combinations. That way
there's not like two million
combinations of
&gt;&gt; supplements and you just order your own
custom gummies.
&gt;&gt; I think that makes a ton of sense.
&gt;&gt; Like you're never going to go somewhere
else to buy those. I think I think as
long as it's easy enough to make or like
you have to buy a year's worth or
something like that,
&gt;&gt; I think that
&gt;&gt; the hard part there is the
manufacturing, but the marketing sells
itself.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; The two biggest categories in DDC right
now are probably the gum the
gumification of things
&gt;&gt; and uh electrolytes right now. You just
see every electrolyte brand under the
sun just
&gt;&gt; running up.
&gt;&gt; I still need to make my busy juice and
sell that.
&gt;&gt; I think it would do well. I think it
would do well. Maybe some kind of
combination of that, right? rather than
like like the gummy of Gatorade
basically.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you know, gummy of Gatorade.
&gt;&gt; Like that. The GG.
&gt;&gt; I like that.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; This is reminds me of an idea I've had.
So, one of my hundred 200 domain names
is race tattoos.com.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Now, I used to run ultramarathons, trail
races,
&gt;&gt; and have you ever ran like a trail race?

[15:00]
&gt;&gt; and have you ever ran like a trail race?
&gt;&gt; I've done a marathon, not a trail race.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, even with a marathon, like
there's two things you want to kind of
keep track of throughout the race. the
elevation profile,
&gt;&gt; when am I going uphill, when am I going
downhill, and like the the pacing, where
are the aid stations? Is this three
loops? Is it end to end? Is it out and
back? Is it like a lollipop? Right? They
have all different types. And like when
you're out there, especially for
&gt;&gt; five to 50 hours, like you kind of want
to know where am I at, right? So, I
thought it would be cool to kind of do
like a permissionless marketing thing
where you make these temporary tattoos
and there's a bunch of companies that
make them,
&gt;&gt; but they're it's a temporary tattoo of
the elevation profile of your race. And
you could do it for 5ks. It doesn't have
to be ultramarathons, right?
&gt;&gt; And then you get there, you anytime you
do a race, you get a little packet, a
shirt, metal, whatever. Adds
&gt;&gt; uh what's the LMT that you get stuff
like that, right? That's great. and you
just pull out a temporary tattoo and you
put it on before the race and as you're
running you're just like oh here oh I
got an a station coming up it's like a

[16:01]
got an a station coming up it's like a
Google maps
&gt;&gt; I think I think that's great and I feel
like there's so many ways you can play
with it too like even if it's like if
you're making bespoke ones it can be
like all right let me overlay like what
I want my nutrition plan to be on it to
like add this mile marker I should eat I
don't know if you already have guides
that and aids that like do that for you
but like it at least gives you a couple
like reminders or things like that that
you can keep in the back of your mind so
Yeah. Well, it's also like it's very
Instagrammable.
&gt;&gt; If you put that on, you're going to post
it, [clears throat] right? And they have
like semi-permanent tattoos that will
last for like weeks or months, right?
And if it were something like that, then
it's like it's just free marketing. So,
&gt;&gt; to the race to the
&gt;&gt; tattoo company,
&gt;&gt; I think it would do super well. I also
think that yeah, like you get it in your
in your starter pack or whatever like
that. I think another version of this
that could be really interesting and
this depends on depends on how hard it
is to make custom temporary tattoos. So,
hinges a lot on the manufacturing. So,
have you you're you're down in in
Dallas. Have you ever been to ACL or
like any of these big kind of like music

[17:01]
like any of these big kind of like music
festivals things?
&gt;&gt; No.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Austin City Lament.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; No, haven't been. So you basically get
this crazy lineup at the beginning of
the the thing and and I'm going to
connect this idea in a second, but you
get this crazy lineup of like here's
three days, here's 100 acts, whatever
&gt;&gt; these bands on Thursday, Friday,
Saturday.
&gt;&gt; And so then you get in a group chat with
your friends and you say who do we want
to see? And every single day and these
things literally draw hundreds of
thousands of people out to them every
single day. What people that are my age
do will be they they get their Friday
lineup and they highlight it and they'll
make something kind of bespoke and
they'll screenshot it and they'll put it
as their phone background and then
Saturday they'll wake up.
&gt;&gt; You're always referring to it.
&gt;&gt; Yes. And then Saturday they'll wake up
and they'll be like here's like I want
to go from stage one to stage two to
stage three. I want to see this person
at 7:00 p.m. and this person at 9:00
p.m. So
&gt;&gt; I'm going 100%.
&gt;&gt; Right. So So you're going to the weekend
and it's EDC Orlando and it's Friday. We
got this stage, this time, this person.
And it's like you're walking around,
it's like, "Oh, where are you going at
700?" It's like, "Let me check."

[18:00]
700?" It's like, "Let me check."
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly. And it's like, it's a big
event. It's something that like people
spend a lot of money on. Tickets for
these things can range from $500 to
$1,200, if not more for the full weekend
type of event. You're paying for lodging
already. You're paying for food. You're
paying for all of this stuff that like
if you tell me it's $50 for a bespoke
thing cuz girls and everyone's already
paying for like, you know, makeup and
hair and other stuff. I think it could
be a pretty big market.
&gt;&gt; Oh, dude. The question is, do you try to
get the people to pay for it or do you
get Austin City Limits to pay for it and
include it for free?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I think if it's you get
everything, then Austin City Limits will
do it. If it's no, I want Chris's lineup
and I want like I don't care about
Rascal Fats, but I can't miss Zack
Bryant and therefore Z Rascal Fats is
not on here, but the Zack Bryan at
Exfinity Stage at 7 p.m. is, then that
would be a better one. M. Yeah. Cuz when
I first started looking at this idea, I
found a dozen companies that will make
custom temporary tattoos.
&gt;&gt; How much do they cost?
&gt;&gt; A few bucks.
&gt;&gt; Really?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It's not bad.
&gt;&gt; That's pretty great.
&gt;&gt; You just send them a design and they're
like, you know, 100 piece minimum or

[19:01]
like, you know, 100 piece minimum or
whatever. The cheaper it gets.
&gt;&gt; But so you don't have to become like a
manufacturer. You're just like white
labeling it, right? Is drop shipping
still a thing? Yes. But unless you have
the right tools, you are going to have a
really hard time finding success.
Luckily, I found a genius tool that can
build an entire drop shipping site from
scratch. This platform has people
hitting 10 grand their first month, and
others have used it to build over 30
grand per month businesses in their
first year. AutoDS is making this
possible for over a 100,000
entrepreneurs with zero inventory
sitting in their garage. Zero warehouse
headaches, just pure profit margins from
products that they never even have to
touch. AutoDS makes drop shipping crazy
easy. We're talking complete automation,
product research, order fulfillment,
inventory tracking. Everything runs 24/7
while you sleep. You get access to 500
million products from suppliers all over
the globe who handle all of the
inventory and storage. So, here's
exactly what you need to do. Click the
link below to try AutoDS for 30 days for

[20:02]
link below to try AutoDS for 30 days for
just one buck. AutoDS lets you create a
Shopify store from scratch in minutes
directly through the platform and then
you can start selling immediately
because remember you can just do things.
So go get on AutoDS because the best
time to start building wealth was
yesterday. The second best time is right
now. If we go back to races like there's
no company that only puts on one race a
year, right? Like generally it's a
business. They'll have multiple races a
year. And so I would just proactively
send the race director, you know, if I
know they're they have 3,000 spots, I'll
send them 3,000 tattoos and say, "Hey,
this is free. I thought you'd like it.
Go ahead and put them in every bag or
whatever, they're for sure going to come
back and buy from you." Assuming people
like it, they get good feedback.
&gt;&gt; And putting ads on them would be pretty
hilarious.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, race tattoos.com right
there, right?
&gt;&gt; Or or I'm thinking like like sell ad
space on the tattoo. Nobody nobody has
successfully gotten tattoo advertising
down the way that it should. So like if

[21:01]
down the way that it should. So like if
you're selling like you use Gatorades as
an example like but you have Gatorade on
top of it and [clears throat] you can
tell Gatorade, hey I know for a fact,
you know, we have a 10% adoption rate of
all that we send. New York City Marathon
is 50,000 people running it. We're going
to have 5,000 people with Gatorade
temporarily tattooed on their arm for
the next week. It's pretty good.
&gt;&gt; Oh. All day,
&gt;&gt; right?
&gt;&gt; Oh man. Especially if you could get like
you could get multiple people to pay for
it.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You could get Gatorade to pay for it.
&gt;&gt; You could get the race to pay for it.
&gt;&gt; And then you could even you could upsell
like more custom temporary tattoos to
the actual participants if they wanted
to show it off, right? You could just
direct people to your website with a QR
code or something because I'm thinking
like if I have all that surface area for
people wearing my product, I want to try
to sell them something as well.
&gt;&gt; Now, what is that? I don't know, maybe
it's just like a a semi-permanent tattoo
business where they can say like I ran
an ultramarathon, you know, for like 3

[22:00]
an ultramarathon, you know, for like 3
months.
&gt;&gt; So, honestly, what I was expecting you
to say when you first brought up race
tattoos was like a badge of honor type
of thing. And like, you know, I'm sure
if I was a bigger runner or like people
who are just, you know, the truer of the
world, whatever. Like these guys could
probably start checking it off and
almost make it like a cool like badge
thing. Mhm.
&gt;&gt; I wonder if there's something there
where it's like fill it in and you have
like the hard part there is, you know,
big enough market size and then you make
it culturally relevant. So like the idea
of you showing up to a race right now
with all of your races that you've ever
run tattooed, I'd be like, "Okay, this
guy's pretty freaking legit and that's
probably a small market size, but if you
can make it culturally relevant of like
we're going from the LA to the New York
City Marathon or we just did the Moab
240, now we're doing the Bigfoot 200."
Like that would be a lot cooler, I
think.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Especially because it's such a
passionate audience and they're proud of
what they did.
&gt;&gt; It's like a It's like a human bumper
sticker, right? Like how many times have
you seen a bumper sticker that says
13.1,
&gt;&gt; 26.2?
&gt;&gt; It's like a tattoo version of that.
&gt;&gt; I like that,
&gt;&gt; dude. Here's another idea in the same
vein. So bike races.

[23:00]
vein. So bike races.
&gt;&gt; Mhm.
&gt;&gt; Right. I read this stat that said road
cyclists ingest like so much exhaust
from cars.
It more than offsets like the health
benefits they get from cycling. It
either more than offsets or it partially
offsets to where it's like you net out
even.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Right. Because that's a crazy stat.
&gt;&gt; It's crazy.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And so I was looking into these things
and we all remember the co era the face
mask.
&gt;&gt; This guy like in India or somewhere
invented like this nostril mask and it's
just like a little sticker. You put one
there, you put one there and it's a
filter,
&gt;&gt; right?
&gt;&gt; Yep. Love. So, same distribution idea.
You give it to the races for free.
&gt;&gt; They put them in the bags and cyclists
can wear them and then when they pull up
to a stoplight and they're behind cars,
they just don't open their mouth and it
filters out the crap. How well does it
work? Nobody knows.
&gt;&gt; Certainly better than not having
anything, right?
&gt;&gt; I mean, the reality is with a lot of
this stuff, it is problem solution
framework. It is fear

[24:02]
framework. It is fear
&gt;&gt; solution framework. Like everyone who
cycles is healthconscious obviously to
start. And so to even just be basically
say like this will do something and like
have some results like don't don't be
selling snake oil or whatever like to
have some results people are going to
buy it.
&gt;&gt; And the nice part is it's subscription
and you're going to be able to have
these different packs like similar with
like hostage
&gt;&gt; and you can ship as from coming from an
e-commerce background like you could
ship it in an envelope for like 54 cents
whatever the cost of a stamp is because
they're so flat it's less than an ounce.
&gt;&gt; Do you cycle?
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Do you Okay. I'm just thinking do you
breathe through your mouth or do you
breathe through your nose?
&gt;&gt; I don't I don't even know. Well, the the
reason I ask is because I'm wondering
something that's already pretty popular
is a lot of this mouth tape for
sleeping. Yeah. So, you think of like
hostage tape, think of a couple other
companies like that. Could you just do
the mouth tape for cycling? Like, can
you take the same exact product and and
rather than putting somebody sleeping on
it, just put somebody cycling and then
cuz like your nose is already natural
filter. Yeah. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And so if people have the tendency and
listen
&gt;&gt; not medical advice, consult your doctor,

[25:00]
&gt;&gt; not medical advice, consult your doctor,
but like if people already have the
tendency to breathe through their mouth,
however, people can breathe through
their nose and it is just a habit that
needs to be formed and you can say your
nose is a natural filtration device,
whatever.
&gt;&gt; Then I think it would be interesting to
sell bike tape right over your mouth.
&gt;&gt; Well, it doesn't just have to be cycling
either. like I don't remember but I've
heard like in running to optimize your
breathing or endurance or whatever you
like inhale through your mouth and
exhale through your mouth something like
that and that's like common knowledge
right for runners
&gt;&gt; clearly I'm not a runner because I don't
remember what that knowledge is but
&gt;&gt; if you were to just sell like the mouth
tape for that like a a functional mouth
tape for a different purpose
&gt;&gt; that might not work five or 10 years ago
before the mouth tape company but now
that people are accustomed to seeing the
ads seeing that it's normal it's like oh
this is just for running this is to me
remember to run better, therefore I'll
have more endurance and I'll get a
better time.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, theoretically,
&gt;&gt; I think it makes a lot of sense. I think
also the the fear part, there's the
there's a benefit part of I'm going to
be a better athlete out of this, which
is like aspirational, sell that vision,

[26:00]
is like aspirational, sell that vision,
whatever. Then there's [clears throat]
the don't you want to actually make sure
you're not breathing in toxic stuff,
especially when you are breathing the
most that you ever do in any given day.
And I feel like that would sell really
well.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. with the nostril things. I
love that it's already a product cuz
it's right now it's being marketed as
like a a slimmer alternative to the face
mask, right?
&gt;&gt; You just license that thing, put it in
different packaging.
&gt;&gt; There's I think a big trend in a lot of
products around there around filtration,
filtration of water, filtration of air,
filtration of all the dust that's in
your vents, which I guess is the air
part of it. Big money industry, very big
money. And so I think what you can do is
try to figure out what are the other
categories that you can put that in. I
love the filtration of air for cyclists,
filtration of air for athletes,
filtration of water. I don't really
know. Like you see a lot of like the
shower head stuff popping up right now,
a lot of faucet stuff, a lot of harsh
chemicals that like there's probably a
lot of money to be made in that space
just with like more niche positioning.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know that they have like
filtered showerheads, right?

[27:01]
filtered showerheads, right?
&gt;&gt; What are those filters supposed to be
removing?
&gt;&gt; Chloride. Yeah. Heavy metals. Uh, this
is what they tell me, but it's it's
heavy metals. It's a lot of like I don't
know if it's bacteria. I don't know what
what exactly it is, but it's stuff that
impacts your skin and your hair. Like
the value prop that you see on a lot of
the ads is better, fuller hair, cleaner,
healthier skin, all that stuff.
&gt;&gt; Do they have one for microplastics?
Like a a shower head to filter out
microplastics?
&gt;&gt; No, but that would be interesting.
Somebody just launched a company that
audits your environment. Have you heard
about this? Do you know what I'm talking
about at all?
&gt;&gt; It's like
&gt;&gt; I haven't heard of the specific company
you're thinking of, but I'm familiar
with the concept with the industry.
&gt;&gt; So I think like might be wrong about
this. Somebody will come to your house
or somebody will do a Zoom call around
your house and they'll say, "Show me how
you cook." Y and you'll you'll show them
a not stainless steel pan. They'll be
like, "Okay, check mark." Yeah, exactly.
&gt;&gt; Oh, you hate your kids. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; They'll be like, "All right, like bring
me up to your event. All right, I see
some dust over there. Like see your

[28:00]
some dust over there. Like see your
filter or whatever." It is basically
like a I don't know if it's an at cost
or a free consultation to then upsell
all these product enhancements whether
it's a lighting in your ceilings or the
shower drain or whatever the hell it is
right and so to your point on filtering
out microplastics I think this initial
consulting service based business is
really great to capture a large audience
&gt;&gt; and then as far as filtering out
microplastics is probably probably a new
microwave or like it's probably like not
heating the plastic or like removing
like it's a hard
&gt;&gt; it's a forward a holistic problem. I
think
&gt;&gt; you know
&gt;&gt; yeah I feel like with those home audits
people would pay for that like they
would pay to be upsold other products.
&gt;&gt; So this is where like you and I might
have talked about this in the past.
Merrick Health. Do you remember this at
all? We might have not talked about it.
&gt;&gt; Merrick Health. Maris Health something
like that. It is a company that will do
a relatively low cost blood test
&gt;&gt; because for them the blood test is like
all right we're going to get you in the
door and we're going to be like the the
pioneers of data. like we're going to be
very consultative and you're going to

[29:00]
very consultative and you're going to
trust us and then once you get the blood
test back it's like Chris you're
actually really low on iron and vitamin
D and like you're pretty deficient in
these other five categories.
&gt;&gt; We can put you on a program that's
custom and bespoke to you and buy all
the gummies and vitamins through us
directly and just stay on subscription
and then we'll test your blood again in
6 months and you'll see if we've
improved anything. And that's a really
good way to do it because you get this
consultative these people are smart
approach and then it's well you just
gave me the problem now give me the
solution.
&gt;&gt; And I think for the what's wrong with my
environment there's like you can change
out iridescent light bulbs like I'm
currently in my apartment right now just
going through all that phase of doing
like floor up lighting and like trying
to make it a softer space at night and
like I watched a bunch of these YouTube
videos and kind of hacked it together.
But if there's somebody that I could
call instantly and I'm like, "Hey,
here's my apartment. Like, give me five
lamps and like where to put them in and
like set up my Alexa for me." Like, that
would be a great service. And I think
that you could do that for your
environment for health products.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Have you heard of Function Health?
&gt;&gt; Yes. Yeah. They're they're big. You

[30:01]
&gt;&gt; Yes. Yeah. They're they're big. You
can't use them in uh New York City,
though.
&gt;&gt; Really?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I think it's I think there's some
legal thing there.
&gt;&gt; Okay. I I'm using them.
&gt;&gt; You like it?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, it's like I think it's
like six or 800 bucks a year
&gt;&gt; and you that includes two blood tests.
&gt;&gt; It seems like a no-brainer.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And you just go to like a lab corp
or whatever and you get like 12 vials of
blood drawn and two weeks later they
give you your testosterone, your blood
sugar, like
&gt;&gt; oh, it's like 103 different biomarkers,
right?
&gt;&gt; What I did with that is tediously
screenshotted every single result. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And it was like green, yellow, red. It's
got beautiful design. It's like an
Airbnb feel. And then I just uploaded it
to a Chad GPT project and I was like,
"Fix me." And now I take pills every
night like a boomer, right? No offense
to add that up. [laughter]
&gt;&gt; Do your uh do your new uh biomarkers
look better?
&gt;&gt; I haven't taken the second one yet.
Okay.
&gt;&gt; It's been like 3 months. I'm going to
get another one in 3 months. I take fish
oil. I take niacin. I take a vitamin B
complex.

[31:00]
complex.
&gt;&gt; And like I just think it's so funny when
people start like taking pills and
they're like, "Dude, I just feel so much
better. I just feel so it's like do you?
&gt;&gt; It's cheap insurance.
&gt;&gt; I just I've never had a period in my
life where like I I just I always feel
good. I was 260 lbs and I felt good.
Like I just don't know. It's all
confirmation bias, right?
&gt;&gt; I think there's so much there's a
personality type that is super optimize
heavy.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And as a result of that, it makes it
such that you actually never feel good
because you can always be doing a little
bit better. And I actually think this is
maybe a side tangent that's not as
business related, but like the good that
probably a lot of the Huberman and
Fairest stuff of the world has done can
probably also be pretty offset by the
person who actually feels worse the next
day because they got 7 hours and 55
minutes of sleep versus the exact, you
know, eight and a half hours that they
were regimented to get or
[clears throat] like, you know, god
forbid they looked at their phone within
an hour of going to sleep. Like at a
grant at a high level, I think all of

[32:00]
grant at a high level, I think all of
this advice is actually very helpful and
directionally correct.
&gt;&gt; But like when you are obsessed with
getting the perfect thing, whether it's
the perfect level of fish oil in your
bloodstream or like the perfect weight
on the scale or whatever, you're
actually never going to feel good no
matter what.
&gt;&gt; And so I think that it's just like a
mindset shift honestly for a lot of it.
Like the the pills do very little,
especially with these supplements.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And really the only thing that
makes me feel like really good is
caffeine.
&gt;&gt; Everything else is just secondary. I I
will say I think I think creatine does a
little bit for me at the gym.
&gt;&gt; I need to do it. I need to take it.
&gt;&gt; I think I think there's like the meme of
like what you think you're going to feel
like when you have creatine and it's
like the it's like an Instagram video of
everyone using those fake glass bottles.
It's like you toss me a beer just
smashes in his hand. Uh like the reality
is you'll probably get one or two more
reps on everything in the gym.
&gt;&gt; Okay,
&gt;&gt; that's kind of it. And that's if you're
consistent with it, but it's like very
tiny gains.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I was listening to another podcast
and they said that of the top three
bestselling creatine gummies on Amazon,
&gt;&gt; two of them had zero creatine.
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; Zero. And so what Subode does is they'll

[33:02]
&gt;&gt; Zero. And so what Subode does is they'll
test everything.
&gt;&gt; They'll they'll take it into a lab.
Unbiased third party. They're not like
they strategically don't have affiliate
links. Like they're unbi like they
charge for the app. That's how they make
money, right? Because they know they
have to, right? And be unbiased.
&gt;&gt; Quick question. What if there were a
private community out there of people
that were building businesses based on
this podcast? Well, I just made it and
it's only for business starters and
business builders. It's called TK owners
and it's basically like having me and
100 other business geniuses as your
business partner. Also, there's going to
be exclusive new trends, growth hacks,
business ideas, and a database of
everything I've ever talked about.
You'll find thousands of startup case
studies. You'll have weekly ask me
anythings with me while I'll answer your
questions directly. You can join now at
tkowners.com, link in the show notes. So
you can go use the app and see like, oh,
like I need to take these creatine
gummies. Oh, these might be good, but
they haven't been tested yet. Oh, these
I thought that's a really interesting
business model. And I'm wondering what
else you could do that with.
&gt;&gt; I'm trying to think. It's like it's

[34:00]
&gt;&gt; I'm trying to think. It's like it's
almost like giving like you're selling
trust, right? And so I'm thinking like
it's like the Michelin Michelin stars of
rating or like the IMDb, which if that
was actually relevant or the Rotten
Tomatoes, whatever
&gt;&gt; of food. I don't even think you need
that in a different category like or I
guess you do for the sake of like
thinking of new business ideas but like
there's Crea Pure is the name of the
brand that everyone goes to and you
almost want to see their manufacturing
brand on their logo and you see like
David's protein butch bought I forget.
Do you remember what I'm talking about
like the EPG thing?
&gt;&gt; No,
&gt;&gt; they bought like whatever protein allows
them to have like this crazy caloric
difference.
&gt;&gt; Oh, I did hear about that.
&gt;&gt; Manu I don't think it's EPG. It's just
something like like the David Bar.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly. I think finding like a
trusted third party of one specific
thing, whether that's creatine, whether
that's the bioavailability of a certain
supplement, I think makes sense. I know
that there's another company out there
called Seed Oil Scout.
&gt;&gt; I've heard of that.
&gt;&gt; You've heard of them? Yeah. So, they
will do like all of the restaurants in
New York City and show you the ones that

[35:00]
New York City and show you the ones that
do not use CO
&gt;&gt; and they have like a Yelp like a
directory for
&gt;&gt; Exactly. So, I think you have to find
something that people really care about.
Like probably a good one based on an
earlier conversation would be like
filtration and like air quality or
something like that. Like can you have
someone test air quality at every
Marriott across America and that
therefore you're staying in hotels that
like only actually are sanitary and like
follow the code or something like that?
&gt;&gt; What if you did like a subco for popular
snacks or foods for their their caloric
contents or their ingredients? Right.
So, I I love uh Old Trapper beef jerky
&gt;&gt; and they have this it's like teriyak and
they have these medallions and they're
really good and I was eating them last
summer like a ton and they were like I
think they were like 10 calories per
medallion and I was just crushing them,
right? But then I looked at the the
weight and it was like one medallion was
like 28 grams which is an ounce and when
I did the math on like the the
nutritional facts differently it was off
by 100 uh%. Right? So basically I I just
divided by the weight of the serving
size or something.

[36:01]
size or something.
&gt;&gt; They were 20 calories per.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Right. And I think it was because they
were like 14 pieces for 140 calories,
but when you looked at the weight, it
was actually 280 calories. And I was
like,
&gt;&gt; this is like a massive brand. These are
sold in every gas station, every
100%. And it's just because I happen to
do the math.
&gt;&gt; It's got to be wrong everywhere.
&gt;&gt; I don't know how it works with some of
these companies. You'd think that they
would be more conscious of it so that
way they don't get in trouble with like
the FDA or whoever monitors this type of
stuff. I can tell you right now for the
supplement space, it is like it is
probably the one thing that you can get
away with so much as you kind of just
pointed out with subs. I mean, at the
end of the day, like people are going to
eat that beef jerky because they like it
tastes good and it fills them up,
whatever.
&gt;&gt; No one is taking supplements because
&gt;&gt; they taste I guess the gummies maybe,
but like because they taste good and
because it like fills them up
necessarily. you're only doing it
because you want the desired outcome
that you think that this will make you
more healthy. And so if it's not
accomplishing that goal, the efficacy is
just really important for this type of
stuff.
&gt;&gt; Well, I found out the same thing when I

[37:01]
&gt;&gt; Well, I found out the same thing when I
was trying to make my busy juice drink.
I was trying to buy lemon powder
&gt;&gt; and I learned by accident that this
lemon powder I had been using for mine,
it was supposed to be pure 100% lemon.
That's what the it showed. But it wasn't
at all. It was like crystallized. And I
talked to this chemist and he's like,
"If it's crystallized, they've added
these sweeteners." I was like, "This
should not be sweet at all." And it was.
I'm like,
&gt;&gt; very tart. Is that right line? Like,
isn't anyone looking at this? And then
when I was doing keto for like 6 months,
I had like these this product from
Trader Joe's
&gt;&gt; and it was like two net carbs and like I
was testing my blood for ketones and it
was outright wrong. So, it's like, okay,
the three times that I've actually held
the, you know, the nutritional value
feat to the fire.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. That's crazy.
&gt;&gt; They were all wrong.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. So, just so a food a a CPG version
of subs.
&gt;&gt; Yes. All you need is a it's called a
bomb calerimeter. It's like this little
device that anyone can buy where you you
take food, you grind it up, you
dehydrate it to get all the water
content out,
&gt;&gt; and then you put it in like a pill form
and you burn it.

[38:01]
and you burn it.
&gt;&gt; And the machine measures how much energy
is emitted from burning it. That's the
calories. Those are the calories, right?
&gt;&gt; That's cool.
&gt;&gt; And however many heat calories are
emitted, that's how many calories that
that food had. So you had to get you got
to basically take a slice of pizza, you
let it dry 100%, blend it up, put it in
a pill form, and then you light it on
fire in this enclosed space, and it
measures how much energy is coming out.
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's super cool. I have no idea.
&gt;&gt; You would basically take like a box of
Cheezits or something, and you would do
all that, and then you'd say, "All
right, we can affirm that this lot
number has actually this many calories.
The carbs are this much. The fats are
this much." And so,
&gt;&gt; you know, a lot of these foods we eat
every single day. Like I'll eat a Quest
bar one to two times a day, the same
thing.
&gt;&gt; And it could be completely wrong and it
could be having a completely detrimental
effect on my body and I have no idea.
&gt;&gt; That's really interesting. Eat whole
foods I think is the eat whole foods and
uh develop subs for CPG.
&gt;&gt; There you go. That I think there could
be a business there.
&gt;&gt; Especially if there's just like a
verified like I think you have to
basically How do you do it though?

[39:00]
basically How do you do it though?
Because I think you have to make a
marketing campaign that your nutritional
labels are lying to you. Yeah. and
basically an attack on the government
and the FDA and whoever makes that kind
of stuff and says if you want the real
information come here and basically
start with a whole like actually audited
version of the app.
&gt;&gt; Wow, that could spread so easily with
short video.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I like that.
&gt;&gt; All right, what's your idea?
&gt;&gt; All right, how much time we have? All
right, we got we got three minutes. Let
me You're going to get an elevator pitch
and if we want to do a deep dive on this
later, we can.
&gt;&gt; So, you're in New York right now. There
are a ton of bathous here and one that
has recently popped up that is taking
over New York City and if you're in your
20s and 30s like you've probably heard
about it because it's a big like social
wellness thing is Other Ship. Other ship
is crushing it. They are uh this like
sauna cold plunge steam room type. I
don't have seen it steam rooms but
really cool novel experience and they
took this you know however many year old
hundreds of year old concept hot and
cold and they made it trendy and cool.
So, there's another concept that is
hundreds of years old or or has been

[40:00]
hundreds of years old or or has been
around for a while that has gotten a
little bit trendier, but honestly hasn't
had like a good brand dominate it, and
that's silent meditation retreats.
&gt;&gt; And so, we've seen it pop up more in the
last, I don't know, tech era of like the
last 15 years, whatever, of like these
tech gurus, they're going away for 3
days, 5 days, 7 days, whatever. They're
not talking to anybody, no phones,
disconnected from technology. They come
back, they were healed, they had a
realization about themselves, whatever.
But if I asked anybody, you know, what
what sign of meditation or dishi did you
do? There is not a
&gt;&gt; there's no brand.
&gt;&gt; There's no brand. There's not a clear
one thing. And maybe that's because the
market's not big enough. Maybe that's
because the version of it is not
accessible enough yet. Whatever that
looks like, but like you know, people
made tiny houses trendy via like
getaway. They've made cold plunges and
sauna trendy from other ship. And so
there's a lot of ways that I think that
you can make this concept trendy. And a
lot of it probably comes down to, you
know, make it more accessible. You
didn't do a seven-day silent meditation
retreat. You did a 48 hour silent
meditation retreat
&gt;&gt; or four hours or like an afternoon,

[41:01]
&gt;&gt; or four hours or like an afternoon,
honestly.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah, probably. And I think so
then maybe maybe you can do it within a
place, right? Like, hey, I'm going here
on a Thursday night to just clear my
thoughts and not think about anything
like shut the world out. They take my
phone in the beginning or whatever. Four
hours is actually probably the smarter
version. I didn't think about that. I
was going to say do it, you know, within
a 90-minute drive of a city. To your
point, do it in the city. Like New York
City is the loudest, most busy place on
the freaking planet or at least in the
US. And if you can walk in and reliably
say, "I'm going to give you this. I'm
going to give you my phone." Maybe
there's like some distress protocol and
then it's 4 hours sitting at a freaking
wall and like you're in a distractionree
environment where you're like, "Why do
you do that in your living room?" It's
like I've got my TV, my Kindle, my iPad,
my laptop, my phone. And so like this
forces me to be present.
&gt;&gt; What do you think? I love it. And kind
of like people taking supplements
saying, "I feel so much better." They're
going to come out of there being like,
"That was incredible."
&gt;&gt; Yep.
&gt;&gt; I changed my life.
&gt;&gt; Yep. And it's going to spread and it's
going to be I've got a lot to think
about. I'm going to go into chamber.
Whatever you want to brand it as. I

[42:00]
Whatever you want to brand it as. I
think it could do really well.
&gt;&gt; Call it quiet place.
&gt;&gt; Quiet place.
&gt;&gt; Like the movie.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I was going to say quick lawsuit
and then we're right back.
&gt;&gt; That's fine. That's fine.
&gt;&gt; That's a good one. You wouldn't need a
lot of space. It could be like a very
small room.
&gt;&gt; I think it could be a very small room.
You could probably have two versions.
You could probably have like like a
phone booth, like a Weberwork phone
booth kind of setup almost where it's
like, "All right, I'm I'm here." And
then you could probably have a group
room where it's like you walk in and
I've talked to some people who have done
these things and some of it's like, you
know, they walk in a circle for 4 hours
or like they sit on a pillow and they
look at the wall, but like the point is
it is intentionally pretty unstructured
and unguided. Yeah. And I would say for
something like other ship, other ship
got a lot of notoriety because they'll
do like these classes and they'll do
these breath work classes. And so
there's probably a world where you can
mix breath work into it. There's
probably a world where like you can work
with somebody on like setting intentions
going into it or like get a prompt to
reflect on or like there's a coaching
element to it. Like there's probably a
lot of like upsells and like flavors of
it. Yeah. But I think that you could
also sell like to your point like could

[43:00]
also sell like to your point like could
you sell a two-hour slot for 120 bucks?
Would people pay that? I don't know. But
like you're basically selling uh the
ability to get away from all
distractions.
&gt;&gt; I bet people would pay it. I love it,
man.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Cool.
&gt;&gt; All right.
