welcome to the ker office everyone so
recently I pulled my newsletter at TKO
pod.com on what types of businesses or
what types of Industries they want to
learn about number one AI number two
home services and then there were like
four other options but it was Ai and
Home Services and nothing else is really
close so I'm going to keep talking about
AI because I love it I'm playing in it
and I love talking about it so that
comes naturally Home Services also comes
naturally so this episode is going to be
all about home services and I'll also
touch a little bit on how you can use a
and Home Services as well but I
interviewed a guy named Doug who's here
in Dallas Fort Worth and he owns a power
washing business that also does
Christmas lights gutter cleaning soft
washing window washing and all that but
before I start this episode with Doug I
wanted to talk just me candidly about
why I love Home Services what my thesis
is for home services and why you should
love them
[Music]
too so why do I love Home Services well
I've talked about this a bunch so I
won't go into it too deeply but we
launched the treature business a year

[01:00]
launched the treature business a year
and a half ago I helped a friend launch
another Tree triming Business four or
five years ago and it's just everything
that I love about Home Services I like
starting businesses that have a binary
outcome I've talked about this a couple
times but not too in depth so a binary
outcome is a product or service where
there's not a lot of complexity involved
now not all Home Service businesses
enjoy binary outcomes but tree trimming
does cut down the tree you remove the
tree you get a festar review it just
feels so ah refreshing to have a
business
that's straightforward cut and dry I
think it's easier to find binary outcome
businesses in the home service industry
than it is in other Industries
especially if you're not doing something
very complex like custom home building
or remodeling so in Home Services you
can enjoy high demand year round if you
have a seasonal Business Like Christmas
lights then you can offset it with
another seasonal business like
Landscaping just like the book I read in
high school entitled Things Fall Apart
Things Fall Apart things are always
breaking number two recurring Revenue

[02:00]
breaking number two recurring Revenue
potential now some services are more
recurring than others such as lawnmowing
but any home service can be recurring
because things continue to break it
might be less recurring than others I
like home services that are high ticket
and high margin $500 to $5,000 per
ticket preferably they have a low
barrier to entry which is a fancy way of
saying you don't need a lot to get
started which also means you usually
have an above average number of
competitors but these are usually
unsophisticated competitors that you can
outrank online with a few creative
tactics there's a lot of room in home
services for more Tech more efficiency
more optimization some software I know
it seems on the surface like if you go
Google pressure washing you're going to
see a bunch of people in your local area
and it seems overly sophisticated but
that's a selection bias you're only
seeing the guys that are sophisticated
because they know how to rank on Google
you're not seeing all the other guys
that have no website that aren't
answering their phones my favorite
experiment and I talked about about this

[03:00]
experiment and I talked about about this
over the summer with stum grinding is to
call up 10 to 20 people per industry to
gauge how hot the demand is for that
industry in any given area how many
answer are their phone what are they
quoting how booked out are they if you
spend an hour doing that for five
different Industries you'll know a lot
about how competitive everything is in
your area home services are recession
resistant you can upsell just about
anything and everything and you can
scale now here's the thing with ai ai is
unlike anything I've ever seen or
experienced it is arguably one of the
greatest asymmetric bets this world has
ever seen and it's freely available to
anyone with a brain and a pulse what
does that mean I want you to picture a
conference room full of entrepreneurs
enterprising hungry ready to go monetize
the world okay let's say you've got a
100 of them 50 years ago what would
those 100 entrepreneurs have started
probably some sort of a service a home
service because there was no internet 20
years ago what would they have started
something on the Internet

[04:00]
something on the Internet
surely but 20 years ago there were a lot
more homes than there were 50 years ago
therefore much more demand for a home
service business owner but the internet
was the newest shiny object so we all
flocked there what happens when the
supply drops and the demand stays
constant or increases price goes up it's
funny because I was watching an episode
of Dirty Jobs the other day from season
one I've been watching it with my kids
this was like season 1 episode 2 or
three and they were doing septic tank
pumping guess what they charged to pump
out an entire septic tank
$70 it is literally 10 times that amount
today 10 times that amount at least
depending on the area there's just not
enough to supply to fit the demand so
today you take a 100 entrepreneurs in a
conference room I don't know why they're
in a conference room I need to leave
that out of my analogy what business are
they going to start you got AI you got
crypto you got mobile SAS agency Home
Service there's so many things to choose
from nowadays but guess what there's

[05:01]
from nowadays but guess what there's
more homes than there ever have been 335
million Americans 8 billion people and
these things are still falling apart so
AI is growing the pie for everyone and
you really can't go wrong either way my
guest Doug he sold a hood cleaning
business in Arizona about 12 years ago
and he was kind of bored and he started
pressure washing for people in his
neighborhood then he started a pressure
washing business he only did that for a
couple years then he started adding
other services took it very slowly now
he's got a thriving business with sixf
figure profit he's not doing anything
super unique super sexy he's just doing
what works over and over and over go
ahead and give it a listen how did you
get your first customer it was just
someone in the neighborhood I can't
remember if she just came off the
website or what but and what was your
first job was it just pressure washing
the side of a house driveway all the
above yeah it was like a front walk and
around the front door and a back patio
pool deck kind of thing so and how'd you
know what to charge onean show at the
time it don't need much right can kind

[06:02]
time it don't need much right can kind
of be cheap and still make some money
and get your name out there but I kind
of looked at it like well when you do
have someone working for you what are
you going to need to charge yeah well
it's back then we need to be around 100
bucks an hour so I just said well how
long's it going to take I think it'll
take this much 100 bucks an hour there's
my price yeah so so how long did you do
only pressure washing or soft washing
before you started taking on other types
of jobs and what did that process look
like we didn't start cleaning windows
until till
2021 so five years yeah that was your
second service line yeah I mean we
always did the gutters there's not a
huge demand for that but we did that the
first real Divergence from that window
cleaning and that's just because you
know you do a house wash you get their
Windows all spotted so finally the next
year rolled around you know we got into
the winter season things so down I'm
like okay I'm going to get trained and
we're going to start doing it so in 2021
I think we just we added that what did
your training look like how did you get

[07:01]
your training look like how did you get
trained I went to a industry convention
where someone was offering training on
the waterfed pole systems you know which
are the the pure water filters that you
use a big pole with a brush to do the
cleaning and that's one aspect you need
to know how to do the traditional style
too you know with the squeegee I hired
someone that had a lot of window
cleaning experience and just got trained
up so let me back up a little bit for
those first five years how were you
finding custom customers did you really
have to struggle or hustle to get them
or did they just come organically
through Word of Mouth mainly word of
mouth and the website okay I emphasized
reviews before reviews became super cool
you know so we had a lot of reviews we
had a website had to do very little
marketing to be honest what did your
first few years of revenue and profit
look like so we started in like
September of 16 so I couldn't even tell
you I think the second year doing it
just on the weekends

[08:00]
just on the weekends
it was like maybe 75,000 or something
and then then and it just doubled every
year for about four or five years and
then we added window cleaning and all
that it's slowed the growth has slowed
so we'll say the first year we did 75
then we'll go like 150 then 300 and then
probably
450 and then 550 or so 600 and it's kind
of leveled there a bit we acquired
another company this year so we should
do you know eight or 900 this year nice
so window washing five years in at what
point did you start adding the other
service lines and what were like the
triggering events for even wanting to do
that so really the pressure washing kind
of encompasses a lot of things you can
do a lot with that the window cleaning
was the big ad really the only other
well okay so I guess you know if you
want to add Christmas lights that
started two years ago what made you want
to start that it was the same thing it
was like you guys are Christmas lights

[09:00]
was like you guys are Christmas lights
you know from the customers and that
industry is kind of blown up too the LED
lights so now you have easy to go find
someone to train you you know get this
get the stuff from
locally and and just go do it so same
thing it's like all right let's start
doing this it's another Revenue line
keep the guys busy and you know in
January to take the lights down when
we're you know it's too cold to wash and
you know just something new to figure
out so and how did you know what to
charge for that and how to do it it got
trained we found a a a local company
well they have a local presence and went
took some training it was like in July
you know so it's like 110 degrees we're
out there putting up Christmas nights at
their training facility and they they
show you all that how to do it where to
get the stuff what the charge what it
costs what the charge is like okay
here's where you want to start and you
have to kind of see what's
competitive so power washing window
washing Christmas lights solar panel

[10:01]
washing Christmas lights solar panel
cleaning did I miss anything there's all
the little stuff I mean's gutter
cleaning there's graffiti
removal all the stuff that goes with
pressure washing and which of those do
you love and which do you hate and why
they're all good I mean the pressure
washing is great there's so many aspects
to it I mean you can do roof cleaning
where you might have to bring in a lift
to do that if someone were to come to
you and say Doug I want to take one of
your service lines in my market and just
go all in on that one thing what would
you advise them to do and why depends on
the area so like roof cleaning and all
that is much bigger near the coast so
Florida is huge with washing Houston is
much bigger with washing because they
have a a bigger problem with algae
growth in those areas so if if you're
there I mean there's companies that that
build big businesses based on just you
know these people people get it done
every year it's almost automatic window
cleaning I think you can't go wrong with
especially if you can try to build like

[11:01]
especially if you can try to build like
say you want to do like I'm going to do
storefronts you know and I want just to
build a book of storefronts that get it
done every month that's probably a good
line it probably it take some time to
get set up the holiday lights same thing
depending on your area I mean here it's
pretty saturated like most things but
you know there's folks that just do that
three months a year and they're good
yeah if someone were to do storefront
window washing only what's the best way
to get customers maybe the cold emailing
cold texting what about solar panel
cleaning if someone wanted to go all in
on that yeah I think the same thing and
you know we we do that but it's like
rare I mean it's a very low percentage
of people that actually have solar
panels to begin with right so you have
to find them in our area at least yeah
yeah exactly so and then of those folks
I mean they have to really understand
that you know these things do need to be
clean once in a while and I've talked to
folks that I know personally you know
through through kids sports and stuff

[12:02]
through through kids sports and stuff
you know other parents and it's like oh
yeah you guys clean solar panels oh we
have these solar panels and efficiency
has gone down to you know whatever and I
talked to tessle and like yeah they
probably just need to be cleaned and we
we need to get you guys out there to
clean them and then they did they never
do it yeah so it's like you know you're
just leaving you have the things well
keep them clean so they're efficient so
that's a tough one in this area we do
very little of it but it's it's EAS easy
to do you know it's easier than doing
Windows they don't have to be perfect
you just have to clean them you know use
the same brush and everything that use
on the windows so I think if you can
find a list somehow of owners of people
that have solar panels you email them
and maybe maybe even direct mail to get
them to think about you know with some
kind of off yeah I think they even have
like AI products now that will use
Google Earth to identify which houses
have it there you go they'll just
pinpoint them out for you yeah I mean
something like that I think that's you
know otherwise you're just passing this

[13:01]
know otherwise you're just passing this
huge net you definitely don't want to
send direct mail out to everybody in a
zip code because five of them have solar
panels you know yeah which of your
service lines have the biggest margins
margin wise probably window
cleaning you you can get away with
charging a little less it can be a
little more competitive but your costs
are less because it's really just labor
you know so probably that the pressure
washing is already good all right if you
are watching this clip right now you are
watching this on YouTube and if you are
a fan of podcast please check out my
podcast while you're at it because
sometimes I have podcasts that aren't on
YouTube and sometimes I have YouTubes
that aren't on podcast so check out the
ker office on any podcast platform or
you can go to TKO pod.com also my
newsletter will throw that in there
there are no ads It's weekly it's
different content than my podcast and
YouTube newsletter. chrisj ker.com
You'll see the link and we'll see you
there how do you quote all these
different jobs do you quote everything
yourself or have you trained your guys

[14:00]
yourself or have you trained your guys
to quote for you combination I've
trained guys we have an office manager
that can quote can do a lot of stuff
over the phone with pictures or Google
Maps Google Earth I have real confident
guys that just have they worked in the
field and they know how long stuff takes
so they can go out there and look at
like yeah it's going to take this is a
big job it's going to take three guys
two days we need this much per day per
guy plus materials you know it needs to
be around this okay just kind of a gut
call yeah I mean from experience in a
lot of companies they they look at
square footage what's the square footage
of the driveway what's the square
footage of the house to get for a
houseat and I just I never did it that
way it doesn't seem to make sense to me
I mean some of these houses they have
issu like you know you have some big
fancy house that has brand new copper
gutters yeah I like interviewing people
that are different from me because like
if I were you and I launched this in
2016 the first person that says can you
wash my windows I'm like yep
don't you need to know how I know how I

[15:01]
don't you need to know how I know how I
watch a YouTube video like I'm I'm the
opposite of you and like we talked about
before this before this podcast like
it's good and bad right there are
trade-offs I I find myself in a lot of
sticky situations a lot of times because
I'm underprepared on the other side of
that and clearly you don't have this
problem a lot of times people tend to
overanalyze and overthink and that means
that they never launch because momentum
kills all deals right so you you really
have to find that balance between the
two yeah I agree of all the service
lines you do you there's probably a
bunch that you could be doing that
you're not doing there probably still a
lot that you're turning down what do you
think is the pressure washing of today
like pressure washing was in 2016 what
is the next Frontier for Home Services
we're looking at a few things that it's
kind of add in there like real cleaning
you know because nobody wants to do
anything anymore yeah if they can get
someone to do it professionally it's
reasonably pric you know I mean I've

[16:01]
reasonably pric you know I mean I've
seen a lot well I could give you one so
the kind of the big thing that's getting
the push now is the permanent
lighting houses there like a jellyfish
isn't that the name of company jellyfish
type stuff yeah so anybody that's into
Christmas lighting you know the same
Distributors are selling that stuff and
everybody's because again anybody can do
it like the landscapers can do it I mean
you know when it comes to Christmas
lights the the bug people do it
everybody Christmas light roofers do BU
people farm and you know all that it's
the same with the jellyfish type
permanent lighting yeah so that's kind
of a and there's now there's all kinds
of companies selling that so that's
probably one thing what about if someone
were to like become a jellyfish
distributor or even use like a Chinese
aftermarket version of jellyfish and for
those that aren't listening jellyfish is
permanent lighting like Christmas
lighting but permanent LEDs you can
change the colors to it can be patterns
it could flash it could be solid purple
or whatever from your phone what about
the idea to just go door Todo in

[17:01]
the idea to just go door Todo in
November and December only to the houses
that have Christmas lights and they're
not your customers they're just
strangers and saying hey you clearly
value having lights on your house two
months out of the year how about these
permanent lights I can install them I
can sell them to you that can be pretty
high ticket right yeah it's a high
ticket item it's not recurring like the
Christmas lights are but yeah for sure I
mean you can I mean you if you're going
to try to get people to switch over that
year instead of doing temporary
Christmas lights you want to start
before November but you can also go out
after they're installed I guess and say
hey next year hey when these come down
could put these permanent ones up
because you know you can make them pink
for Valentine's Day and whatever for
Easter you know you name it and then and
then every the other days of the year
you you know they're up in the sofits up
in the eaves you can just make them warm
white you have like this indirect kind
of lighting in your house which looks
nice too so so yeah you can you can
definitely try to switch people over
what do those cost is it like by by the

[18:01]
what do those cost is it like by by the
foot what is the install cost and the
hard cost I don't know that much about
I'm pretty sure it's by the linear foot
you know and there's probably some
probably depends on stories up it is and
you there's probably some stuff there
too there's there's there must be some
wiring involved them I don't think they
just plug in I think you kind of get
them well you could probably plug them
in but I think you get them probably get
an electrician in there that wires them
in somewhere you know just some
permanent power and then if you were to
give someone device it's about to start
a home service business what could you
tell them that might save them a world
of hurt any in any Niche any Home
Service Niche you want to do some
homework there's a lot of gurus out
there I can you know specifically speak
to pressure washing that charge you a
lot of money to get some training sell
you a rig a lot of stuff you probably
don't starting out I would focus more on
getting a brand getting it out there
maybe not taking on every single huge
project in other words you don't need to
spend 60 Grand get started if they were

[19:01]
spend 60 Grand get started if they were
to go to Home Depot and buy a power
washing machine what which model is a
good one to start that I don't recommend
so it kind of maybe my answer Falls
somewhere in between like you don't
necessarily need to go to the big gurus
and spend a ton of money on something
that's super fancy but you also don't
want to go on the cheap you can easily
with a little bit of research while
right in the middle you get a nice
commercial unit you know and spend a few
thousand bucks and your own truck or
something build your own trailer they
were to spend three ,000 on just the
washer what is there a make or model or
a brand that you'd recommend at that
price range you're going to get
something portable which is fine you
know to throw in the back of a pickup
truck or whatever and you can run around
do driveways with that what about the
mixture just like a bleach to water
ratio or you know again starting out you
can just have a up a two gallon sprayer
and you can get some you can buy pool
glorine at Lowe's you know it's more
expensive I mean we get it delivered by
the truckload now into big tanks but you
know a lot of the real severe stuff 50
50 is going to get you get that done on

[20:01]
50 is going to get you get that done on
flat stuff you be careful with houses
much less you know you know a quarter
half a gallon of bleach to a gallon and
a half of water you know so two gallon
okay is there an insurance company you'd
recommend another good question so for a
years there was a company JD JD Walters
that everybody got their insurance from
they went through kind of an ownership
change and they kind of went and audited
all their policies and they hadn't
raised prices in years and companies
went from one guy to Five Guys and they
didn't moded it and then when they did
they realized you know either they had
to raise the rates a lot or they just
couldn't Ure you anymore so it's you can
get in a lot of places if you go on some
of the Facebook groups you can just
search and people have recommendations
on Brokers it it's it's pretty very
inexpensive starting out you know okay
are there any specific numbers that you
track on a regular basis that you'd
advise others to track like yeah so so
we do job costing which means you know
every job
get many hours the tech was there she's

[21:01]
get many hours the tech was there she's
getting an hour the burden and all that
taxes and all that kind of stuff
chemicals used and then the amount of
hours Put on the machine which is fuel
you know basically that just converts
the fuel that gives us our
growth so you know we want a certain
number we want typically under
30% of the cost of the job in labor and
what net margin are you shooting for
Net's another moving Target so you know
that's going to be based on um while
your other overhead right so you know
starting out when you're like a solar
operator like your gross is like your
net I you have insurance you know and
that kind of thing but as you get bigger
and you have to have a shop and you have
four or five trucks and you know bleach
deliveries and marketing and all that
it's a whole another you know then you
have an admin cost you have an office
manager you have a production manager
all those things are kind of they fall
to your fixed
overhead so it's going to make your net
you know that's that's not really an
answer but starting out it's like the

[22:01]
answer but starting out it's like the
same like net and gross are almost the
same you look at these big hbac
companies and stuff that do plumbing and
electrical and they have 100 trucks so
their net margins are like 5% yeah you
know except they're just doing millions
of dollars so it's a pretty high margin
Biz if you can hit a 20% net that the
owner can take home that's a pretty good
number we were fortunate that we had a
good customer base before the kind of
big boom hit Co I think is where it
really took off you know Co was a great
was was great for us because people were
home lot of the home service industry
construction all that kind of stuff they
were you know at first the beginning of
the whole craze like they were the only
people allowed to to be out there
working right was like anybody out uhing
on houses and that kind of thing so the
only cars on the road trucks on the road
were work trucks so our business blew up
from that the industry also blew up so
we were fortunate we had a nice customer
based a lot of repeat business so every
time we added a new line like we're
getting ready to add line striping you
know we had a base to go to and very

[23:01]
know we had a base to go to and very
little digital getting ads that kind of
thing so these days I'm sure it's
different just because of the
competition okay well thanks Doug where
can people find you if they have any
questions our websites Park Cities and
