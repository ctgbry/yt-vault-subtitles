[00:00]
it's just not that complicated don't sit
there and make your pitch deck don't sit
there and build the perfect website all of that
is irrelevant all that research is just advanced
forms of procrastination you know what I
should do instead of jump i should watch
a YouTube video on how to jump and it's like
dude just jump impatience with action patience
with results go launch the thing today but be
patient with figuring it all out get on sales
calls with nothing to sell just ask them what
they're struggling with they just tell you the
problem it's first party customer research a
lot of people don't do the first party part i
think people want to know how your sugar water
experiment's going dude it's so interesting
tell me what's not that complicated it's just
not that complicated like sales or specifically
when people are trying to launch like any business
really right like I think a lot of people try to
like have this perfect pitch perfect offer perfect
everything before they start the only thing that I

[01:05]
tell people to do when they're trying to like
start any business is just get on sales calls
with nothing to sell you can align yourself to
kind of a specific thing there's this dude in in
the Grow Faster community that got on he was like
"Yeah I want to start a Google Maps optimization
business." He was like "I want to help people
manage reviews." Which is a great idea phenomenal
idea and I was like "Cool go get on sales calls
that's literally it don't sit there and make
your pitch deck don't sit there and like build
the perfect website all of that is irrelevant."
run some ads that say "Business owners are you
struggling with Google Maps schedule a call."
That's it like super broad not like we're going
to achieve this result we're going to do this
service we're going to No no no it's like are you
interested in improving this kind of broad stroke

[02:02]
area of your marketing get on the phone and then
just ask them what they're struggling with because
they'll just tell you the problem yeah you could
even go a step further and say like go to chat
GBD beforehand and say I want to ask business
owners what they're struggling with but I'm
afraid that they won't know how to answer because
I think a lot of times people aren't creative and
they just they are struggling with things but
they can't remember in the moment so it's like
give me give me some ice breakers or give me some
like probing questions that will help extract out
of a business owner what they're struggling with
because if you just ask them broadly like what are
you struggling with oh my employees showing up to
work on time okay that it's not relevant to what
I'm selling but if you were to say like what are
you struggling with with regards to your reviews
system on Google Maps well it's like I don't think
to respond to reviews i know it's important but I
don't think to and I know Yeah it's like okay I'm
going to there good to know yeah or like one-star

[03:01]
reviews kill my business and like if they were to
just go away somehow I could make $4,000 more per
month because what I sell is high ticket and once
the reviews just kill us noted okay reputation
management maybe you know right and these
conversations will like we think we go into these
conversations thinking all right now I'm going to
know how to sell better but really what it becomes
is now I know what to sell yes that's the thing i
was going to sell GMBB optimization services now
I'm going to sell reputation management because
eight out of 10 people talked about their Google
reputation you know yep and that's the flip that
would happen so he he was thinking he was going
to do review management he set up a super simple
salesunnel he ran some Facebook ads at like $30 a
day right like he was booking calls for $30ish
dollars right he's never taken a sales call in
his life like this man is he's he's awesome cuz
he's actually doing it but like has no experience
gets on these calls i'm coaching him through like
what questions to ask and all of that stuff and

[04:04]
he goes "These people don't really care about the
review management side they care more about where
they rank that's all they're talking about is
how do I rank higher how do I get more people
in the door how do I do whatever." So then he
changed his ads to speak to that of like we'll
help you rank on Google Maps better and his
landing page schedule call for your ranking
audit or whatever and started booking calls for
$18 and then closed his first deal and has two
more that are supposed to close this week this man
started from zero has never touched a Google Maps
optimization in his life figuring it out he's
not like a lifetime local business owner no no
behind the MacBook yeah i mean he was he spent
his career in customer service in England and
was like I just think that this is interesting
like it's cool and he's killing it like three
active clients like after a month of going like
from literally zero what are his unit economics

[05:06]
he's white labeling a software i don't know what
he's charging i told him like don't set pricing
just like talk to people and see what they can
afford as long as like your math makes sense and
I told him he's going to have to spend the time on
these people right like it's not like he's going
to hire anybody to come and do this like he's
just going to he's just trying to build like
side income like if he can go make a couple extra
thousand dollars a month like he's a happy camper
i don't think the software is that expensive like
may maybe a hundred bucks a client and I told him
he should be able to sell it between like four
and 600 pretty easily what he's trying to do he
was like I need to close my first ones one to like
get proof that this is worth doing and two to get
some reviews or testimonials from people so that
it makes it easier to charge higher prices later
that's the beauty of Facebook ads is the first
person we find is someone unrelated to us someone

[06:01]
that doesn't care about us which is the most
valuable customer right right there is a lot of
value to going to your cousin your uncle the guy
at church to get your first customer 100% because
it's low friction and like learning Facebook ads
even just bare bones there's some friction there
if like if you have to learn Facebook ads before
you find your first stranger customer we'll call
them then you might not ever launch right but when
you start with a first customer that's a stranger
to you it's like a clean slate and it's a perfect
case study every business that's going to reach a
meaningful size comes from getting people to pay
you that do not know you you're always going to
end up selling to strangers if you're trying to
grow something big if you're trying to do a side
income like you want to run a car wash on the
weekends like yeah you can probably make your
3,000 bucks a month off friends and family and
referral right like but to go build something big
so here's how this works i make you free videos
i actually know what I'm talking about i have no

[07:00]
greasy sales pitch at the end and if you implement
what I talk about you'll make a lot more money and
have a better life and all I ask for in return is
that you hit the subscribe button and maybe even
the notification bell just like that thank you
you're going to run ads anyways so you might as
well just start there or you get the false I call
it a false positive it's like you getting five of
your friends to sign up is not the same as five
strangers buying your thing because like those
people are it's like warm versus cold audiences
it's like the warm people are just more likely
to buy because they know you cold people need
you to prove to them that the value that you're
providing is worth the dollars that they're paying
very directly there's no like "Oh he's a nice guy
i'll support his journey." Like no no no no that
doesn't help anybody no and then if your product
sucks they're not going to tell you either no like
that be like "Dude this is my favorite t-shirt."
And it ends up at Goodwill two weeks later it's
like you know doesn't matter there's a lot of
frameworks going on here the offer just being I
will help you rank more is just perfect because

[08:02]
that's something that every business owner can
comprehend i will help you rank higher does this
kid have like a set offer or is that kind of it
does he have like a guarantee a no-brainer offer
is he just tolding it out i told him not to i
say get on the phone with as many people that
fit your target demo and like loose benefit
right because they'll tell you if you ask the
right questions they'll just tell you what they
what they're struggling with what they're looking
for actively from a help perspective and most the
time they'll tell you what they'll pay for it you
can AB test pricing live on the phone as long as
you know what your floor is especially early right
like early on you're just trying to like get
cash in the door and so even if it cost him
$100 to like do the the software like cool then
you know what your floor is you can go in and be
like yeah well you know we charge $800 a month for
this service right and the guy goes dude I can't

[09:07]
really afford that my answer to that is okay
like you want this thing you want the benefit
let's just shoot straight human to human what can
you afford for this if I can if I can deliver A B
C and D what is that worth to you right and homie
goes I can pay 300 bucks a month me on that sales
call I'd be like "Cool because I like you I'll do
$300 a month for your first three months." Again
you're like collecting data you're like "Okay
this guy will pay 300 he runs a business in a less
populated area that doesn't have as many reviews
right versus the guy I talked to another guy
later this week that has like twice the number of
employees is in a really nice area and he can pay
800 you just start to like play it out versus like
I sell this for a,000 bucks a month especially if

[10:02]
you're early you have no clue yeah like that's
just your brain coming up with something that
like your brain wants to hear versus like turning
to the customer it's funny like I think about like
AP economics in high school wtp willingness to pay
was like a thing that we talked about for like a
week it's like you're just trying to figure that
out like what is the willingness to pay like how
much are they willing to pay for this thing right
like where in my brain the easiest way to get the
most real gauge of that is talking to the customer
everyone else is like looking at their competitors
and like googling it of like and that's all
dope like cool what is their willingness to pay
you like how do you get the first party data of
conversations versus chat GPT saying the average
Google maps optimization business charges $400 a
month and it's like I don't do and it's not going
to be that accurate i don't know it's one of those
where it's like first party data run your own ads

[11:06]
figure out what your cost per click is do your
sales calls figure out the customer's willingness
to pay and what they're actually interested in
and like if you just do that for 30 days I like
can guarantee that you'll step into the next 30
days with so much clearer thinking around what
you're trying to sell yeah all that research is
just advanced forms of procrastination right it's
like% it's kind of like you're on uh you're you're
walking the ladder up the high dive and you're
scared and on the way up you're going to stop and
tie your shoe a few more runs up you're going to
check your Instagram real quick go up a few more
times and you're going to look around hey where's
the concession stand and it's just like dude just
get up there and jump then you get on the end and
you're like you know what I should do instead of
jump i should watch a YouTube video on how to jump
well you know what like should I do a cannonball
like that would be crazy right should I oh should

[12:00]
I like do a It's like dude just jump just jump
just do it the perfect analogy for this was my
mission i served a mission in Hungary and I went
to the MTC the missionary training center which
is like 10 minutes away from where I am right
now for 12 weeks that's which is such a long
time they don't even send people there that long
anymore it's like torture right yeah and all day
flashcards flashcards conjugations flashcards
studying flashcards flashcards vocabulary and
by the end of the 12 weeks you are like I am
a genius i am fluent in Hungarian my accent is
perfect how did I learn this in 12 weeks and then
you get on a plane to Budapest you hop off and
you get out and you're like "What language did
I just learn this is not Hungarian i hear it i
don't hear any words." And then you start talking
to people and you're like it's like Michael Scott
i understand nothing right you understand it's
but then you start talking you pick up a little
bit and like over the next 12 weeks you learn 10
times more than what you learned in the previous

[13:02]
12 weeks because you're in the deep end right and
the church is catching on to this and so people
are staying in the MTC for shorter and shorter
and shorter amount of times because that's just
kind of like a formality like does it help to
know your conjugations like or what's plural
what's singular yeah when to masculine when to
fe Yeah it's it's helpful to have a somewhat of
a foundation but you just got to jump and learn
you just got to go with regards to pricing one
trick that I found is to like catch the potential
customer in their words and so instead of like
you go into the conversation saying I'm going to
charge 800 bucks a month so are you telling me
that every call you get organically from Google
is worth $60 is that accurate yeah I guess since
you say it that way yeah $60 net profit in my
pocket every call cool you're getting four a
day that's 120 a month what if I could increase
that to 500 500 calls a month what would that be
worth to you oh I don't know what it No I know
what it would be worth to you yeah we just ran

[14:00]
the math we know exactly what that matters yeah
okay so it's like 60 bucks times 500 $30,000
well I've got pretty good news for you because
this is only $800 a month like this is only Well
what if it doesn't perform then I give you your
money back you have nothing to lose right and
this is a bromosyism i can't claim this but like
the offer should make them feel stupid for saying
no why would you say no to paying 800 to get 3,000
or 30,000 or whatever it is right but if you just
go into it and you're like you get to that awkward
moment that every salesman hates and like how much
is it oh I don't know and you hem and haw like by
the time you say the price it should be stupidly
obvious that they should say for us yeah 100%
i mean it's like it's uh so I've always early
on the math that I always run was like the 10x
value creation on pricing of like if I'm going
to make you $2,000 I can super comfortably charge
you 200 because you'll 10x and the nice part is

[15:07]
it it bakes in even underperformance right where
it's like even if I 5x your 200 you're still happy
but it's like easier math for them to think
about of like "Oh dude if you land me one
more job a month for this 500 bucks I'll make
five grand." And it's like in their brain it's
like "Oh yeah that's a no-brainer." Here's a trap
that we fall into though let's say it is 10x like
your product or service provably provides a 10x
return on dollar spent then the temptation is to
say "Man that's pretty juicy that's a lot of meat
on that side of the table i think if I raise my
prices and make it 7x that's still really good
and they're right but if look at the companies
like just look at the Fortune 500 i guarantee you
that the ones that are worth the most amount of
money and or the ones that make the most amount
of net profit sell products or services that have

[16:02]
a 20 or 200x return on investment right this
MacBook right here I bought I was thinking
Apple the same way dude I bought it four and a
half five year i can't remember it was like five
years ago it was a MacBook Pro top-of-the-line
16 in and it was $3,300 and for a cheapo like me
that's a lot of money and I've spent eight hours
a day on it every day for four years what is the
return on that like that's why Apple's a $2.5
trillion company yeah and why I have the watch
and the phone and the studio display and six
laptops and a desk so I'm like dude this thing
is printing cash for me i want to spend more on
Apple yes so it's like don't be satisfied with
the 10 like whatever i don't know what your goals
are if you hit your income goal then do whatever
the freak you want right right but if you really
want to level up then try to have like 100x ROI on
your product or service to your customer because
then they're going to shout you from the rooftops
they're going to tell all their friends they're
going to come back they're never going to churn

[17:02]
it's a no-brainer this this isn't my quote either
but impatience with action patience with results
go launch the thing today but be patient with
your pricing be patient with figuring it all
out yeah i think a lot of people get caught up
in the the speed i I catch myself in that a lot
right now right like I'm moving very very quickly
and a lot of the stuff that I'm working on has
longerterm payback periods and that is where the
more like you'll just make more if you can extend
that timeline and you see these people that do
like they're like I call them idea hoppers right
where it's like I had this idea on a Monday i
did three things to try to see whatever oh but
I had a better idea on Thursday let me jump to
the next thing try super hard at that for three
days oh but I'm not making any money right it's
like oh digital product let's do that oh let's
launch a service business oh wait what if we do
ecom oh well what if we did lawn care like it's

[18:05]
like yo yo yo like pick something commit to it
for 60 days and just actually do the things that
drive results and give it the time to be able
to actually give you what you need out of it
and then you get a real working on something for
3 days doesn't give you anything you got to let
it run i think the tricky part with idea hopping
which is like that's my whole brand right right
is knowing when you've done enough before you try
another one and that took me years to figure out
100% quick question what if there were a private
community out there of people that were building
businesses based on this podcast well I just
made it and it's only for business starters and
business builders it's called TK owners and it's
basically like having me and 100 other business
geniuses as your business partner but you give
them 0% equity also there's going to be exclusive
new trends growth hacks business ideas and a
database of everything I've ever talked about

[19:00]
you'll find thousands of startup case studies
you'll have weekly ask me anythings with me while
I'll answer your questions directly you'll be in
my Slack channel where I'm hanging out every week
and helping members one-on-one we've got exclusive
guest speakers including some names that you'll
recognize and if you're building something cool
I'll introduce you to anyone you need tk Owners
is the fastest way to plug into a smart ambitious
group of builders and accountability partners that
are sharing wins without the fluff and it's 99
bucks a month about the cost of an energy drink
per day you can join now at tkowners.com link in
the show notes it's the reason I talk about paid
ads to everybody all the time as they're trying
to figure stuff out it's like I would rather spend
$500 over the course of the first week to
get real data on can I sell this are people
interested in this like first party data on
it like not looking at exploding topics and
being like oh more people are interested in X
thing i'm going to go chase that it's like cool
use that as the seed now go run some ads and get
on the phone get on the phone with people even

[20:05]
if you're trying to launch an ecom brand if you're
trying to launch a software product if you're what
no matter what the vehicle is that you're trying
to go and push run a funnel on Facebook that
says attention target customer stop struggling
with pain point talk to an expert today simple
onepage funnel email opt-in calendarly link get
on the phone with them even if you're not going
to sell them anything just like talk to strangers
who are interested in that value prop and you'll
like know very quickly what's good it's like it's
first party customer research and I think a lot
of people don't do the first party part they rely
like we were saying on chat GPT to tell them about
a market or Google search trends to see if people
are interested like cool all of that is good to
give you the beginning concept of like this might
be something next step is get on the phone with 20

[21:01]
people in that market that want that thing and
ask do you want coaching do you want a book do
you want software do you need a service the only
reason you're on the phone with me right now is
because you're struggling with X what can I do
to support that like oh you want coaching sick
i charge a hundred bucks an hour buy four hours
we'll do four weeks cool like then you made your
first dollar off proving the fact that people
will pay for a solution to a specific problem
game over and what you just bought confidence
more than anything yeah and it's for me it's all
first party like do it yourself like first party
data first party data like can I get someone to
buy or express interest in this and is it painful
enough that they will talk to a stranger about it
speaking of idea hopping the people want to
know how your sugar water experiment's going
d dude it's so interesting and for those just now
catching up Sam came on my podcast on May 28th and

[22:01]
talked all about how he started this hummingbird
nectar business in a few hours started pushing
Facebook ads to it and started making thousands
of dollars profitably and literally all it is is
sugar in a bag that's the backstory did get a
repeat order i turned off ads when I ran into
those so those bags take forever to get and I was
moving a good amount of inventory and so after our
convo about the shipping issues I was like "Okay
I'm going to move down to 15 ounce bags." Yeah
cheaper shipping right if they order one my my
cost will go from 8 to four i can make that work
and so I I order I order the bags dude they are
really small i I think I did my math wrong on the
size of the bag that I needed and so I'm going
to change my top offunnel offer to sample pack i
think I could sell a starter kit for like 22 and
just see like I'm going to test it run discounts

[23:03]
if it's two for 18 cool like we'll figure that out
but the other piece is there's this guy on Amazon
that sells the uh hummingbird nectar extender
extender it's this little It's this little vial
it's literally just water and micronutrient
copper sulfate which you can buy for like 18
bucks a pound but he's sending out 1 oz bottles
that are 90% water and he sells them for $16 on
Amazon and is moving like a,000 units a month
right now and you put a drop of it in healthier
it's an antibacterial so your hummingbird nectar
doesn't like go bad oh my gosh and so as if the
hummingbirds care dude the hummingbird rolls
up on it it's like I don't know expired out
yeah dude that thing's been out here for six days
replace that what are you doing that's a one-star
review the hummingbird just looks up through the
window at the owner's like "Really?" Yeah like

[24:00]
are you kidding dude we're never coming back i'm
going to make that an ad so his cogs on that is
sub a dollar and he's selling it for 16 and so for
me to bump AOV I was like "Oh well if I do two 7
ounce pouches plus one 1 oz it's a tincture bottle
you can buy them on Amazon for like 30 cents each
that kit is one pound." And then you get you get
a month of the hummingbird food plus the extender
and I think I can push because he's selling
that for 16 i think I could sell that kit for
like 28 and so I think that's going to be my play
i haven't figured out supply chain on a liquid yet
i don't know what that's really going to look like
i'm going to be out there in the garage mixing up
micronutrient copper sulfate or whatever rv in the
middle of the desert just like Dude trust i had my
garage open last night i was scooping sugar and I
was like "Dude my neighbors looking in as they're

[25:01]
walking their dog are like "What is this dude
pouring these bags of white stuff into these
buckets?" Southern California yeah like oh jeez
dude but yeah I think it's going to be good please
do this please go to V3 and generate a 5-second
clip before and after one of them is is like
they're both identical hummingbird feeders sitting
outside the same window one of them is like a
hummingbird rolls up and then he bounces and then
a hummingbird rolls up and then he bounces and
then on the after it's a hummingbird rolls up and
then a second and then a third and then a 10th and
they're all there's just like this flurry of it's
like before hummingbird extender after hummingbird
extender literally dude yeah I'll do that i think
I said it on the last pod i'm really excited for
next summer i'm going to do Amazon next summer
for sure you have to get like to really do Amazon
right you got to get some trademarks and you know
all the as all of this stuff and it's like it's
definitely a process and I'm operating off of you
know a three to four month busy season it's very

[26:04]
seasonal right i feel like Michael Girdley over
here dude selling fireworks i was like dude we
make all of our money in one week a year and
so I think it's like it's just like that cuz
you know hummingbird migration patterns dude you
could read my book on it hummingbird attraction
101 $14 on sale right i mean only 92% of it the
migration patterns will start to be unfavorable
for my business heading into like September and
so I'm going to prep it for next summer on Amazon
because I think I can compete way better there
and then I'll just keep scooping sugar baby you
know I'm in that's the name of one of those dude
it's like it's like I said before like do I think
it's some massive thing no but like do I think I
could make 100K a year yeah why not like it's easy
enough you just need a a Jungle Scout account
and the ability to use Chad GBT and Google and

[27:01]
Facebook ads and you can use JBT to learn how to
use all those tools i just got an idea and I I
kind of love it do you know if like Replicer
Bolt Windsor do you know if any of them have
like white label ability like where you could
just resell it okay well it's happening right
clearly someone's going to do it someone wants to
be first okay we talk a lot about building rappers
for those that don't know what a wrapper is it's
basically taking all of the functionalities of an
LLM like Chad GPT or Claude and wrapping it in a
different interface for a specific use case like
Sam and I have talked about building a recipe
builder app that's literally just Chat GPT but
the whole marketing angle is how to build recipes
or cook food here's my idea i know you've got like
a personal CRM that you've built for yourself
and you're loving it and other people are using
it or like a productivity app which you could talk
about but everyone wants a personal CRM everyone's
talked about it like there's there's been a lot
of people that have tried and failed to launch it
but personal CRM is just one example i think the
brilliant idea here is to sell like a customizable

[28:05]
personal CRM that's basically white labeled replet
where you get something that fits 80% of people a
personal CRM right and it has these features these
features these features and it fits most people
but then the whole sales pitch is once you get
into it and you're like you know what I kind of
want dark mode click dark mode okay and really on
the back end Replet is just making it happen and
right now in Replet if if we're building something
we can see the code happening on the right side
and that's fine but for most people it's not fine
because it's friction and it's confusing and it's
it's just it's friction right yeah so I would hide
all that and it would just be like one click or
you could have a chat box that's like you know
what this might be a little more complex but I
would love my personal CRM to text me reminders
when it's my friend's birthday and that's not
part of this feature but I know what I paid for
is customization and so I'm going to go to this
chat box and say text me every time my friend has
a birthday so I can text them happy birthday and

[29:03]
then it's like all right give me all right five
minutes later done and all it is is just replet
fixing it and then it's like would you like
to publish this just like Web Flow or whatever
yes publish does that make sense yeah I have a
thought i got to hear it okay quick pause what
if you had an employee who worked 24/7 answering
leads building funnels tracking conversions and
you didn't even have to pay them a salary well
that's exactly what you get with Highle's new
AI employee and right now they're giving you 30
days free as part of their summer of AI promo
and after that it's just 97 bucks a month way
less than you'd ever pay a human and it doesn't
even ask for lunch breaks or vacation time so
check out the link in the description below and
let AI handle all the grind for you okay so love i
think that that's sick i think there's a bunch of
people that are looking or are aware of the fact
that they can build their own stuff similar to my
my app now I'm not trying to go and make money
off that and sell it as a thing or any of that

[30:05]
i think if I were to do it again I think I could
sell that as a template right because I don't
think you need to white label or like hide the
fact that Replet exists right i think you pick
a platform you build this core foundational
product on it right let's just say personal
CRM i think you do more of what Oh what's his name
mark Lever something like that he he runs launch
fast it's essentially a boilerplate it's launch
fa.st okay launch fast sick thing makes a bunch
of money selling a one-time purchase of a starter
template for it's a boilerplate for software very
cool that devs can come in buy install it does all
their It's a foundation i think that that business
model is going to become way more popular
because of subscription fatigue on software

[31:05]
people don't want to have to pay $18 a month for
a personal CRM but if they can buy a personal CRM
template for $100 one time and you package that
with hey we'll give you a bunch of prompts that
help you customize this right here is the prompt
that we would use to install dark mode here's
the prompt that we would use to have it integrate
with Twilio and so you build that template piece
and then give people the support on the back to
be able to customize it i think a lot of people
are excited about this recurring business model
like everyone wants the MR stuff to happen when
like you and I have those conversations of like
MR and LTV right like you can frontload your LTV
by just paying one time like if you're average
if you charge $20 a month but people are only

[32:04]
staying on for six months on average from a growth
perspective it makes more sense for you to charge
$120 one time yeah get that the beginning of the
transaction like than waiting for your cash flow
like to catch up to that number and I think that's
what we've seen the success with launch fast like
he's not charging a subscription like he's just
charging at one time $200 every time you want
to use this thing and it's the foundation of your
software and so I think that there's a world where
people can go and do that i think lovable and
these tools will continue to get more popular i
think that the people that are your customers of
looking for something that's a more customizable
CRM are not like the nancies of the world that
are using their contacts app right like these
are people that are probably more tech advanced
probably aware of way more tools that doesn't fit

[33:00]
their specific use case and so their likelihood of
being able to use a lovable is a lot higher and so
you go build we've built the personal CRM template
that you can go and change to whatever you want
here's the core foundation $200 for this plus 80
prompts that help you customize it to whatever you
want one-time purchase i just think that that's
easier versus what you're going to charge me
$18 a month for a software you're going to ask
me to build like Yeah you know what I'm saying
subscriptions are are in for a world of hurt in
general oh 100% with all this AI dude I just hung
up with a guy my friend a couple hours ago he
works for a company they spend $200,000 a year
on Salesforce and guess what salesforce for them
does way more than they need it to do yet somehow
doesn't do a lot of the things that they need it
to do either yeah right it does like 60% of what
they need it to do but like 400% more features
than they would ever need and they're paying 200

[34:02]
grand so he went and vibecoded an a CRM for their
company for their needs knowing exactly what and
now he's presenting it to them at $100,000 a
year that he vibe coded for like $200 in Replet
credits eight hours at the computer having fun
while he watched Netflix okay yep so Replet they
just announced they hit like a hundred million in
ARR in six months or something but I think someone
needs to white label Replet or something for the
nancies of the world right not just for a CRM
but for like let's say they they want to put all
their paper recipes in an LLM and ask it questions
and so you sell them that template as you said and
then for maybe for the customizable function maybe
there is a recurring fee to that maybe it's a flat
fee for the template hey upload your recipes and
you've got your own LLM for all your recipes but
for 10 bucks a month you could customize it to do
whatever you need to whatever you want it's a
market learning curve question right like will

[35:02]
the nancies of the world It's like the 8020 rule
right because like it's you go to all the nancies
of the world but like how much different is Nancy
A's version of this versus NY's B where like does
it need to be customized right or it's like well
80% of NY's want dark mode so we should just build
the button right exactly that's a one time not
like a here's the prompt do you give lovable to
customize the dark mode it's just like well dark
which starts to get into this like it's it has
parallels to the opensource software community for
Nancy right but it's like then how do you make it
approachable for Nancy that like she actually
cares right like she's not sitting there as a
product lead being like "Dude you know what would
make this app way better for me is dark mode."
Like I don't even think that thought is actually
crossing her mind it's like this app is light mode
i want to cook right what that could mean is
like let's say you sell it to 100 nies and the

[36:05]
foundation the template you're selling looks this
way and after you sell 100 you learn that yeah 98%
of people all want these four features that were
custom that I didn't add okay i'm going to add
those as the default now now when I push Facebook
ads my cost per acquisition goes from $40 to $25
because because of all the hundred nannies that
just bought from me I know exactly what they want
now so it makes your sales process even easier
constant product feedback into it's just iteration
like same that model is happening on every single
software platform on the face of the earth if it
if it's being operated well right we're like oh
we've got a bunch of feature requests we should
probably prioritize that feature build create
that loop right and so it's like the world
where that sort of product exists well and like
is worth doing is farther away than right now i
think that like most of the nancies of the world
just want an app that does 90% of what they want

[37:04]
i don't even think they would customize it like
in that meaningful of a way i agree but I think
one problem with that is that because building
these rappers is more accessible than ever like
Nancy if she's going to log into the app store
and just see a bunch of stuff that looks the same
100% and like if one of them were customizable
with a white labelled replet it stands out it's
the only difference if it's if it's using it
as a marketing mechanism to create that I get
behind and in all likelihood they may never even
use the customization that's what I was going to
say is like they're going to pay extra for it
right that piece of it is the arbitrage not the
fact that they're going to use it that much it's
the fact that it makes them pick you yeah exactly
because they can in theory and you almost have
to have a recurring aspect to that because of the
credits like you're going to be paying credits
to replet on the back end right yeah at least
in the short term at some point you'd get to a
spot where you would again it's just like it's

[38:02]
LTV but like average lifetime credit usage per
customer right where you're like on average in
the first 12 months of people using us they use
87 credits each yep right some customers lose you
money some make you money it Yeah kind scale and
then you can play it and be like well I can charge
lifetime access because it's the credit is not
that bad or it doesn't work and you have to go
monthly when Chris eats at CC's we lose money
when his wife eats we make money but we average
on literally dude that's the math everyone's
running it dude well what else have you been
experimenting with lately v3 with the audio is
really really good like I need scale and if I can
go and sit in V3 for an hour and a half and get 20
versions of people talking and different scripts

[39:01]
and hooks and all of that what we end up doing is
we run those and then we say "Oh this hook is our
highest performer let's go have like an actual UGC
creator going will will invest more money in that
person to go and do it it's like I can make 15 ads
20 ads for $100 to then make a smarter bet on my
one ad for $100 or my two ads for $200 with with
an actual creator so video is cool but you know
what's better long form audio via podcast and my
newsletter tkopod.com go there to subscribe for
free to my newsletter it's one email a week very
tactical and then go to my audio podcast three
episodes a week stuff like this you're going to
love it all free no sleazy salespitch tkopod.com
greg Eisenberg had that podcast with the dude that
made the puppy the puppy commercial i forget the
um but he was taking all of Google V3 videos that
he had made and putting them into Final Cut and

[40:00]
doing post-p production editing to that i'm not
doing all of that i like download the 8-second
video toss it into the captions app and let it
rip and so the one that I I actually thought
about for you dude I got to find I'll find the
account and send it to you but it's this account
on on Instagram that is basically like Gen Z meets
Bible stories and so it's Google V3 they're like
interviewing Moses at the parting of the Red Sea i
saw that so like Daniel in the Lion's Den yes dude
and it's at like 100 thousand plus followers dude
like it's not nothing and I think there's niche
accounts that you could go and do that with like
it's like comedy right so like those guys those
videos are all interviewing biblical figures or
like people in biblical times and they all have
some funny commentary around what they saw they're
like "Dude I didn't not believe Jesus but now that

[41:04]
he's like whatever right?" Like all of the the
kind of humor and I think that there's a world
where there's more opportunity to do stuff like
that and so like one that I was playing with was
like aliens like like street interviews right
with this alien character where his question
was like talking on Earth like he would just ask
people funny questions of like "Oh you guys have
to work 40 hours a week and pay for your own
health care and call that freedom and then like
goes to right and the girls like right like and
like that's just me playing around with it." But
I think that there's like interesting little niche
accounts that like are fun for people to play with
and that you can do in an 8-second clip and you
can get the character to be kind of enough the
same there's another guy that does it with it's
like British people it's all AI and it's like
a younger British guy that's like interviewing
older British people right like grandma's style

[42:04]
and they say like the most out of pocket stuff
it's so funny like tons of like sexual induendos
and like talking about partying and like all this
stuff and it they go crazy viral dude do you have
any like prompting tips on V3 like what has worked
for you like especially when scripting like what
do your prompts look like what's the structure
of them obviously it depends on like what kind
of video you're creating but most of the time I
start with it's like setting right and so like a
busy sidewalk in a urban neighborhood at sunset
it's overcast then it's like vibe right so it's
handheld style street interview gritty like you
can figure out what words kind of show like and
it's it's why I've spent $1,200 on it it's like
I've been testing all of the different like what

[43:00]
does this word mean what does that word mean and
then you have characters right so like it'll be
you know this is a street style interview where
character A is interviewing character B right and
then you say "Character A is a humanoid alien with
blue skin and a glowing neck tattoo he's wearing a
black hoodie and jeans as if he's trying to blend
in with the people around him character B is a
45year-old woman with brown hair who's athletic
and wearing white tank top and black pants
it's like dialogue is what I say right so
like character A and you can Oh the other
piece that's interesting is you can also
control their personalities and so in each
character you could be like he is relaxed and
calm and confident and then you can be like she
is anxious or shy right and it controls kind of
like how they interact with each other which is

[44:04]
cool and then you have dialogue and flow right so
it's character A asks and then you put the script
in right character and then holds the mic up to
character B here's what they say the other issue
that I run into all the time on it is they love
to put subtitles that aren't the actual subtitles
it's like not in English like yeah almost like
when you do Canva like auto expand on photos and
like random Russian characters will just show up
it's like that and so then I'll put at the bottom
no subtitles no whatever to try to get that to go
away the other piece that I actually learned from
that Greg Eisenberg podcast which is the first
time I've ever watched his podcast i love his
Twitter just haven't watched it but the guy
was like "Take the quotes off of the script
like the quotation marks of like this person
says," and then I was putting it in quotes and
he was like "Take that off and you'll see a lower
percentage of them have subtitles which is true."

[45:04]
The other case that does it is don't say I used to
say this is a Tik Tok style video once I took the
word Tik Tok out less subtitles interesting okay
yeah very interesting now I just say this is a
handheld video on an iPhone yeah yeah are you able
to share your screen and show like anything that
like what your prompt has put out i got to see
this i got you the other piece that you can do
is get chat GPT to help you write prompts yeah so
screen share all right all sorts of stuff dude so
you can see this yes sir hopefully you can hear it
too hold up what's your go-to bar in Herosa Beach
oh it depends on the vibe but been loving Tower
12 this year just good vibes and good drinks and
their pizza is underrated right so like I run
the the local newsletter for the South Bay here

[46:04]
right i've been struggling to It's like totally
a for fun project that Lauren and I are doing you
know couple thousand subscribers just like we like
doing it well you're going to vertically integrate
into being the mayor right wasn't the master plan
catch me hermosa 2046 baby i'm Dude it's coming
dude don't worry about me yeah we're good we're
going to start to do social content right and so
like but like I don't have the time to do that so
I was like okay what's a sustainable content style
that I can do and it's street interviews right
like can I see can I see the prompt of that one
dude of course you can see the prompt all right
i'm just for those listening it says street style
interview video featuring a 55-year-old male
surfer being interviewed on a beach during the
day it's overcast and cloudy the interviewer is
off camera but a plain black handheld microphone
is extended into the frame from the right side i
love how specific that is the camera is handheld

[47:04]
a little shaky in classic street interview style
with natural lighting and a slight fisheye effect
there are city noises in the background cars faint
voices ambient sounds dialogue interviewer what is
your go-to bar in Herosa Beach surfer oh depend
i love how you put O oh depends on the vibe but
been loving Tower 12 this year just good vibes and
good drinks and their pizza is underrated can you
play the video again now that we have the prompt
in mind what's your go-to bar in Herosa Beach oh
it depends on the vibe but been loving Tower
12 this year just good vibes and good drinks
and their pizza is underrated what's your go-to
bar in Heros so good like so many use cases for
this like any restaurant we do and this is like
so you can see on this prompt it's the same vibe
right and so like you can figure out like once you
have one style that works right then you just say

[48:00]
"Okay we're going to change this character and
we're going to change the script right?" And so
that one changed it and this is me trying to be
like create something viral like for reference
if anyone is from Hermosa Beach Hermosa Beach is
where all the rich divorced dads hang out what's
your go-to bar in Herosa Beach oh depends on the
vibe but Tower 12 is the best for meeting the rich
dads who will buy you drinks all night right like
you got the the polarity of it the viral right
so like you're like and people that are from
here know that about that bar and so like you
can start to like really play that game oh my gosh
and so those these podcast ones I've really gotten
pretty dialed in oh dude there's some fun ones in
here actually so this is cinematic so this is this
follows a little bit more of that style setting
character right we're not going to read this
whole thing but visual style right the audio and
so it's again you can like update this character
and I'll show you a few different versions you
can now target customers based on what they are

[49:01]
actively looking to buy right now we use Signal to
load that customer data into our ad account every
day right and so like that's an ad dude it looks
so real they're pretty legit i don't know what it
is but like it looks real but you can also still
tell it it's fake you know what I'm saying but I I
can't even point to something about it that looks
fake right and part of it is again the context of
like we know and so this is the same prompt just
with a different character and a different script
black men's skin and hair are different and Golden
Grooming is the only brand built specifically for
us they actually know what melanin needs right
oh I love that mhm like for out of frame speaker
of the other yeah so I've been trying put that
in your prompt can I see that one yeah this one
is it says like a co-host looking slightly off
camera speaking of the mic yeah I don't think
I had that that part that's crazy that it added
it this one has it too I think i think this one

[50:02]
does everyone wants to talk about new lotions or
serums as the solution to their skin problems when
they really should be looking at the ingredients
in their laundry detergent everyone wants to talk
ah these ones are fun the little fake zoom let's
dive into the signal platform we have over 250
million customer profiles with 16,000 dynamics
interests that can get combined to create your
perfect targeting right jeez Louise you just
changed the character right it's an obvious
choice for Facebook advertisers like do you want a
list of everyone that is currently looking to buy
your product yeah I do you can see the subtitle
here yeah but what I love about this one is in
the background you've got a half drank water
bottle little crumbled you've got a bed that's
kind of unmade with like cables and wires like
everything in the background is so realistic yep
right you can see them on It's funny watch oh dude
oh no wait don't don't reload watch the dog those

[51:05]
signal audience campaigns are killing it we got to
call those guys again and see what other audiences
we can add so but this this is the hit rate thing
look those signal audience campaigns are killing
it it's the same prompt we got to call those guys
again and see what other audiences we can add and
so I just started playing with Well look at the
burst frame watch there's there's like a dog and
then it like zooms out and the dog just just
disappears like what are you doing with that
right and like these ones those signal audience
campaigns are killing it like more of the dog the
signal campaigns are doing that well that's insane
we got to call those guys again and see what other
audiences we can add dude the dog the dog holds
your attention though like from an advertising
perspective it's genius i have and a black lab
walking slowly across the room behind him and
you can get the specific you can see his bookcase
with bottles of wine in the background there's

[52:02]
a gold credit card which if you're a Facebook
advertiser everyone is aware of MX gold and so
you start to play in and you get into athletic 35
years old wearing a black hoodie gold watch right
like you can get pretty Are you using chat GPT to
to build these prompts yeah at times here let me
switch my screen share this is something that I I
was using a lot was like I want to create a prompt
for Google V3 video creation that shows an alien
getting interviewed in a street style interview
the interviewer isn't on camera but you see the
mic in the frame right like super Okay here's just
the concept they don't do a a great job out of the
box it'll be a lot of like it'll give it options
sometimes where it'll be like he could be wearing
a black hoodie or blue hoodie and it's like no no
no like you got to go in and like trim the fat
we can just try it like out of the box but you

[53:00]
can start to pick up the details and then adjust
it from there right so it's like look at how it
described the alien cool not mad at that but it'll
say it's wearing casual earth style clothing like
a hoodie jeans and sneakers when like when you
give that to Google V3 you just want to be like
he's wearing a black hoodie jeans and sneakers
right and so like they get a little bit more the
more than you need to give Yeah yeah google right
and then it's like this is me playing with it with
the alien one right where it's like all right give
me a better description for this guy just to see
what needs to happen but I think most of it is
you know then I say I want to write a script for
the alien to say that is a satirical political
perspective on the United States from of someone
who isn't from this world and you can see it right
like your leaders are chosen through a popularity
contest that's decided by people who think the
moon landing was fake but professional wrestling
is right like and it's not perfect but like just
like trying to get into like these like oneliners

[54:07]
right like you banned books but not bullets can
you create this kind of comedy like concept dude
I can't stop thinking of how many business ideas
people could start just with V3 like oh it's
insane let's just niche down way way way down
here let's say you want to have an advertising
agency for restaurants in New York City you know
how many restaurants there are in New York City
40,000 40,000 restaurants so let's say you do
this you one prompt you make the same video you
did someone in Times Square or someone somewhere
recognizable in New York City and it's like hey
what's the best pasta in New York I don't know
like I I really like Olive Garden for the vibe or
whatever it's just some on on street talking and
then as that ad plays you just put the persistent
text above it that says like I can make this this
ad for your business and then you only show that

[55:03]
ad to restaurant owners ers in New York City
and so other restaurant owners are seeing some
fake restaurant ad that looks very real they may
know it's AI they may not it doesn't matter you
charge them 500 bucks a month to run those same V3
generated ads like if if anyone thought up until
two days ago that like social media platforms
weren't going to embrace AI generated videos
like that's no longer up for debate google just
announced we are putting a seamless integration
for V3 into Google into YouTube Shorts like it's
done they're embracing it and why wouldn't they
just an otter taking a bath in a sink these videos
of cats jumping off high dives into the pool got
like 700 million views so good why wouldn't
YouTube Facebook Tik Tok Instagram want that
on their platform why wouldn't they no people
on Yeah they want the highest engaging content

[56:01]
and those videos do the job what other businesses
could be built on top of video generation a lot of
the stuff from an advertising perspective is like
where there's immediate content need right and so
like we do that with home service businesses where
we'll generate video reviews for you know a garage
door opening business or garage door installation
business in Cleveland it'll be like dude company
a a like name a couldn't recommend them enough
in the Cleveland area if you need a garage door
right and so it's giving us ad creatives like that
which is very similar to what you were saying on
the restaurant side right like how do you use this
to create short form videos that promote specific
things the other piece of it similarly is there's
a very interesting world of media companies when
you think about short form video content I'd say
like Vine right cuz Vine was sixsecond videos and
a bunch of these like what I'll say are like
comedians but like fun funny funny people

[57:04]
have like built a career on the back of that
distribution channel and that content style I
mean wasn't like the Paul brothers or Vine first
David Dori right like these guys that became these
massive media companies or media personalities
started with short form sixcond videos because
it's much easier to be really good for only six
than for 60 minutes or for 60 seconds 100% and so
I think that there's people that have I'm going to
define as taste like market taste they know what's
funny the interviews of Moses partying the Red
Sea right like that is culturally relevant good
content that relates to a lot of people people
find it entertaining and funny and the barrier
of entry of creating that stuff is much lower now
where you can go and do that and they've you know
skyrocketed to 100,000 plus followers in what
looks I mean Google V3 has not been out for that

[58:01]
long so like I'm assuming they've gone from zero
to 100K in a month six weeks right like that's a
media company similar to the one that we talked
about the last time I was on the episode which
was the guys that made the videos of like saving
the tiger from under the tree right where it's
like that's a media business i think there's a
world where you could go the Jesus videos the
the ones that are the interviews like that is a
awesome parlay into building distribution for some
Christian related product you could definitely
sell Gen Z Bibles you could definitely sell merch
you could definitely sell whatever that is and I
think that'll be the piece that people struggle
with more of like you can go build phenomenal
content but like the monetization on the back
of that is just a little bit different you have to
figure that out but like from a lift perspective
I think if you just understand videos that like
can go viral and like you can now go create those

[59:01]
a lot faster and I think that that piece of it's
interesting to me figuring out the monetization
on the back who knows but just like Jake and
Logan Paul like they were big on Vine no one
took them seriously i didn't even know who they
were till a couple years ago six-second videos
big deal flash in the pan now they're massive
a correlary to that could be what was it it was
like Jordan and Friends or something that random
Facebook account that has all those AI generated
videos of babies getting almost eaten by tigers
or whatever right like it's probably some guy
in Pakistan right and he's just prompting and he's
prompting he's prompting and he's taking the money
that Facebook gives him and he's pouring it into
V3 credits or whatever even he probably doesn't
look at this as something scalable he probably
is thinking like you know this is going to get
shut down eventually or whatever this is just
my my growth hack of the month or year but like
the skills that he's developing in prompting he
could parlay into anything into a featurelength
film into a 90minute movie this is not going to
be an 8-second cap for very long they're going

[1:00:05]
to be able to do more they're going to figure out
character continuity they're going to figure out
product placements they're going to like and the
people that are sitting there being like I'm not
going to start doing this until the AI is good
enough are going to be behind on the learning
curve when it gets good enough because there's
somebody like me that's sitting here fighting
through the issues with it but now the moment that
it's better I already know what to do like I know
the prompts i know what to play with i know how to
go and and actually turn those into what we need
and so it's like go do even if you don't think
that some niche account of like alien interviewing
Americans is going to make you a millionaire
the skills that you learn for the moment that
V3 can go and do something more you're ahead of
the curve and that's the piece people skip you

[1:01:00]
think that Sean Evans he's the Hot Ones guy on
YouTube do you think that he ever thought that
interviewing people while eating hot wings
would turn into a hund00 million business
no it was just a gimmick right it's just fun
we're having fun sold for hundreds of millions
of dollars yep well where can we find you Sam on
Twitter I'm Sam Thompson you know you have your
own playlist on YouTube now right you got your
own TKO playlist yeah dude no way dude and we're
starting to link to the other Sam episodes in the
playlist now hell yeah dude dude I'm always I'm
always hanging out dude all right let me know if
I should have Sam on again honestly whether you
say yes or no I'm gonna have him on again because
he's a friend and he's doing really cool things
