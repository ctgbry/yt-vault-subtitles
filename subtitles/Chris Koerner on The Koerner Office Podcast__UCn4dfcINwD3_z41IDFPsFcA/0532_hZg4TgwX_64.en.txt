[00:00]
I think the most me and my partner ever
sold on our table is $888,000 on our
table in one night and I once saw a
course doing $70,000 a month on how to
do a handstand what yeah making $100
million is super hard but like there's
not a single business or single industry
that cannot do a million or $2 million a
year I think there's huge opportunity
for duh high-end passages rehab I would
bet cuz casinos have to pay money to
gambling addiction every year
welcome to the ker office as promised
this is part two of my interview with
James Camp you heard part one two days
ago you don't have to listen to part one
first they don't really go together but
if you love part two go back and listen
to part one and share it with a friend
while you're at it enjoy so earlier I
said I own a soccer website and I saw
the writing on the wall with sports
betting I made a lot of money in the
legal cannabis industry not a lot of
money I had a win in the legal cannabis
industry Years Ago by playing ancillary
to it we didn't touch the plan we're in
financial news newsletters around
cannabis equity as they were exploding I

[01:02]
cannabis equity as they were exploding I
would say there's a huge opportunity in
rehab for sports betting that's going to
come our way huge huge huge opportunity
oh there you go I think that covid
basically showed us that everyone's
degenerate Gambler retail came into
Robin Hood because sports betting wasn't
around it became equities markets became
sports betting I see it in crypto you
see everyone wants to gamble gambling is
on a huge rise and once it becomes
federally legal the United States which
it's going to because there's too much
money in that that and it's already
state by state falling down down down
there's going coming to Dallas
eventually I mean yeah there's going to
be a huge group of guys and men and
women I think particularly young men if
you were talking about running targeting
ads young men who have lost everything
and are addicted to gambling and I think
there's probably a huge opportunity for
duh high-end passages rehab but I think
that if you wanted to go lower you could
probably do online communities you could
probably do in-person communities 50

[02:00]
probably do in-person communities 50
bucks a month 100 bucks a month 200
bucks a month newsletter newsletter
based around getting clean from gambling
addiction and I think if you really want
to get weird with it and I don't know
how to do this but this is my sort of
weird business brain thinking I would
bet because casinos have to pay money to
gambling addiction every year that's
part of as our Cino licenses in Vegas at
least they have to take some of their
revenue and it has to be put towards
gambling addiction every year I wouldn't
be surprised if there's a weird business
to be made where you get subsid
partnering with casinos yeah and that
you get subsidized through do you see
what I'm saying where like because I
also built in a different life async we
have to allocate this much of our budget
to rehab facilities so who are we going
to partner with yes and when we used to
run async tele medicine funnels if you
look at I mean I use it FAS if you use
hems on your hair right you run an async
tell I mean dude this is going to be a

[03:01]
tell I mean dude this is going to be a
little niche and esoteric but hopefully
someone hears the Magic in this thought
about this I would run an async gamblers
addiction funnel right I you fill out a
form if you get approved by the doctor
that and asynchronously in the same way
that you get your ED medication you get
your hair medication you don't actually
talk to a doctor fill out a form the it
gets sent to a doctor they get forms all
day yes no yes no yes no and then the
insurance pays for that right
hypothetically so my thought is there's
a weird puzzle to put together here
where running ads for asynchronous
funnels in which you can get approved
for subsidized gambling addiction what
do you mean by asynchronous what I mean
is that you don't actually have to talk
to someone to get you approved for your
gambling addiction treatment okay that
gets subsidized by the government what I
mean is that you fill out a
questionnaire and asynchronously gets
sent off to someone that approves it yes
or no this is how tele medicine really
took off this is how hims and hers and
Roman they all took off but you didn't
actually have to go and talk to doctor

[04:00]
actually have to go and talk to doctor
about your Ed you went through a type
form basically they silicon valed it yes
they silicon valed it you went through a
type form and async as opposed to I
don't know what the other word would be
for non-async but non-async so opposed
to actual oneone real-time conversation
with a doctor you fill out a form and it
gets sent off and somebody approves it
so that's what I mean by async right
asynchronous yeah okay and so what I
mean is you're running ads for gambling
addiction person fills out the form
because they want to go through gambling
rehab if they hit certain qualifications
it's free for them because it's
subsidized by the government because a
doctor an Addiction Rehab addiction
specialist has said Chris has his
gambling addiction he needs $33,000 of
rehab that gets subsidized by the
casinos because the casinos are paying
that do you see like the little flywheel
I'm trying to make here yeah yeah yeah
and I think that whoever if that could
work you all of a sudden are running a
funnel as a marketer as a business in

[05:01]
funnel as a marketer as a business in
which you're getting someone free rehab
help right they getting them actual free
help it's actually a $33,000 rehab
program that's getting paid for by the
casinos and so you're making more like
$3,000 a customer so you're happy to go
spend $100 acquiring said yeah customer
or client that's esoteric and weird but
that's one I've thought about before
last no I like it the optimistic take on
this is like hey they're going to gamble
anyway so why not be in the business of
getting them unaddicted from gambling
and the pessimistic take is what are the
incentives going to be are are you just
going to be incentivized for them to
never be cured it's kind of like the
private prison system right yeah private
prisons are not incentivized to get
people out of jail so it's like on the
like surface level it's like wow this is
good we you know free market is stepping
in and helping these guys rehabilitate
and then you dive in a little deeper
it's like oh this is actually pretty
crappy yeah talk the lobbyist right so
you wonder why they're lobbying against
cannabis legality for example right you
know what I mean they're like you know
in that scenario or like in this

[06:00]
in that scenario or like in this
scenario it's like you're obviously then
getting subsidized by people that are
lobbying to allow more gambling right
like yeah anyway that's why I wanted to
caveat that idea with like I recognize
are some some qualms with it it reminds
me of like I just keep coming back to
First principles and I was thinking
about junk food the other day like I
firmly believe in 50 years we're going
to have peanut M&M's and they're going
to taste the exact same I don't know if
the ingredients will be the same but it
is just like 100 years ago we didn't
have junk food right and now we have it
and we're addicted to it so Will
there'll be a healthier ver version of
peanut M&M sure will there still be
peanut M&M's absolutely right like 10
years from now people will still be
addicted to their phones right but there
will be even more solutions to not be
addicted to your phones like if you I I
knew a guy that opened a restaurant in a
mall and he opened a healthy restaurant
and his thesis was there are no healthy
restaurants in this mall it's all Panda
Express and chipotle all this garbage

[07:01]
Express and chipotle all this garbage
stuff so we're going to be the only one
and he failed right because it's like
that wasn't the place for healthy
restaurants like is there room for a
salad restaurant yeah but you know what
like most people want junk food and in
50 years we're still going to be eating
junk food even if like everything's
trending more healthy we're still going
to want to eat M&M's every now and then
and so I think of like addiction and
gambling like you can ride the wave of
helping solve these problems or you can
ride the wave of you know inventing new
iPhone apps so we can look at our phones
longer and either way like just stick to
First principles and you'll win there's
a couple big lessons I think that I've
learned in 36 and I filled a lot of
stuff and managed to eek out a couple
wins a lot of luck behind those as well
but like yeah I mean I think fighting
I'm a huge human
nature yeah fighting human nature is
wrong I I I think that I've learned to
like as much as it hurts my ego be very

[08:00]
like as much as it hurts my ego be very
okay to be proven Wrong by data like I
don't really like like data doesn't care
about your opinion you know I mean like
I don't care what you think people want
to buy you know what I mean like if this
is what people are buying this is what
people are buying you know another firm
belief here is that unless to go back to
my adtech example unless you're trying
to really create a new industry that
actually competition is often like a
pretty healthy marker of a healthy
industry with this opportunity right
like no one's like oh my God there's an
accounting firm that already exists I
shouldn't become an accountant I mean
like no there's tens of thousands and it
just means that there's a market for it
I get people all the day like hey here's
my idea what do you think I should do
this I'm like well is anyone else doing
no no one's else doing it don't do it
then yeah don't do it why would you do
it yeah you really you think that there
there's a reason there why is no one
doing it well and I find often that with
like media businesses for example
because I've dealt a lot with the media
space right so people think it's all
Zero Sum I say people say to me like oh
why would I use a newsletter as an
example I remember I once had a
conversation with someone at a boxing

[09:00]
conversation with someone at a boxing
newsletter they're like why would I
start a boxing newsletter like someone's
going to read ESPN instead and I was
like you're just assuming that that like
people's attention is zero sum right
they're like they're like just because
someone watches Chris on Instagram
doesn't mean they're watching James
that's just not how it works right like
if you're really interested in
entrepreneur content you're probably
following 10 entrepreneurs right and
there's probably a rotating cast of it
in which some people get replaced and
some people are new and you know if
you're reading a newspaper like ESP in
today's world maybe back in the day when
you got newspapers delivered only you
said I only read the Times or I only
read I mean from New York New York
papers I only read the post because
that's what I pay to come to my house
every day but in a world where there's
like a glut of information the way it is
no you're going to read lots of
different things you might read three
newsletters about something you're
really passionately interested about if
I eat at McDonald's it doesn't mean I
don't eat it in andout sometimes if I
eat it you know if I eat a sweet green
it doesn't mean I don't eat a tender
green sometimes right and so I think
that like one of the biggest which then

[10:00]
that like one of the biggest which then
puts you in a tough place where I'm at
in life and I've actually had a
conversation with someone earlier which
is that like I'm going to say this is
like sort of my hot take but that like
making a $100 million do is super hard
not that I've ever made 100 million but
I've I've done some some big things and
I'll huge amount of luck is is required
but like making a couple million dollars
there's not a single business or single
industry that cannot do a million or2
million dollars a year yeah and can
scale to that anything can scale to a
million I cannot I mean I once saw a
course doing 70,000 a month on how to do
a handstand you know like what yeah yeah
oh my gosh you know we just live there's
eight billion people because there's
eight billion people you know and and
and it's just not impossible so and then
making a million or two million dollars
a year saturation is essentially a myth
that that's where that's where I'm going
with that right like you know I've said
the same thing yeah nothing's
oversaturated I've nothing is over I
mean yes if you say to me I want to make
a $100 million a year there are certain
industries in which I'm going to tell
you there are incumbents in the space

[11:00]
you there are incumbents in the space
that own them too big for you to really
play in it at that level unless you're
going to really try and overtake it but
yeah we're talking about you making a
million or two2 million dollars a year
there is infinite opportunity and
saturation is a myth I really really
believe that and I hear people all the
time saying well like here's how you do
you you copy something that's working
and then you do it a little differently
and I would take it a step further and
say no just copy something that's I was
going to say yeah take his step take it
a step less yeah you you you can do it
differently right maybe you can do it
better maybe if you try to do it
differently you do it worse you have a
thesis about this thing and well if I
just add this feature to it then it's
better maybe you think that and it's
actually worse so maybe the lower risk
option is to do it the exact same and
just remember I wonder if all eight
billion people on the Earth have heard
about this thing if no then just do the
same thing 100% I'll tell you this
reminds me of like there's a couple
things in my life that I found recently

[12:00]
things in my life that I found recently
were just the most applicable things
ever and one is the midwit curve the
bell curve of the mid yes I think about
it every day every single day so
applicable to all of life right and
what's funny is I was talking to a
friend who has sold some bigger
businesses than I have and I was saying
to him because we're talking about this
Paradox of choice once you realize what
you and I just said Chris like once that
clicks for you you realize you come into
this Paradox of choice because you're
like oh I can actually do anything and I
don't mean to sound crazy but like if
Within the real realm of reality and
reality you and I both believe is making
a couple million dollars a year I can do
anything I can't become a doctor
tomorrow because I have not licensed to
practice medicine right that's you know
mean I'm not gonna fly because I can't
break the laws of physics but within the
realm of reality like any business I
want to go build I can do anything I
want so we were talking about that and I
told him the problem for me and this is
me being cocky and we laughed about it I
was like I'm not the
Jedi but I'm not the midw I was like I'm
I'm the halfway in between I was like
I'm a little smarter than the average
showe and he goes the funny part is I
think everyone thinks they are the on

[13:01]
think everyone thinks they are the on
the and so iron is that is the midwit
right is like the midwit thinks that we
are not full Jedi but smarter than the
average Joe and so and for anyone who's
listening or watching and doesn't know
what this meme is it's a bell curve and
on the left is a caveman in the middle
is a guy who's angry because he's
complaining that this won't work this
won't work and on the right is this Jedi
essentially right and the idea is the
Jedi and the caveman get the same
results right and so to go with what
you're saying I think the the
appropriate thing here is that the
midwit says oh I need to make it
different oh I have to differentiate in
some regard and the Jedi and the caveman
are just like no just copy and do the
exact same thing that someone else is
doing right and and then from there it's
it's I had had a conversation with a
friend about how I'm always trying to be
the Jedi and he was like dude that's
impossible just try and be the caveman
you know he's like you know what's easy
is being DB you know he's like I don't
know why if you generally believe that
the caveman and the Jedi get the same
results stop trying to be this 180 IQ
and just think about how what would a
dumb person do here the caveman do here

[14:00]
dumb person do here the caveman do here
and the caveman says you know oh people
read content on boxing I like boxing I
write newsletter about boxing you know
yeah like in that in that scenario and
so I think that like the Nugget I'm
trying to get across here is that like
none of us are smart as we think we are
it's much easier to pretend to just be
an idiot and just do what an idiot would
do which is it's a Trope almost man but
the amount of people I know that I don't
think of as like
wildly with like massive intellectual
capacity that make good money is pretty
large yeah the skill of reverse
engineering and copying and looking at
the web archive and like looking at
newspapers.com like that is an
underrated skill literally like knowing
how to copy another business I I
interviewed a lady over the summer that
has a porch pumpkins business did you
see that tweet no she she's in Dallas
she oh wait maybe I maybe I did she
decorates porches with pumpkins for fall
and she charges $500 to $2,500 to do it
and it's a million dooll business
and $1,500 for port for pumpkins and it

[15:02]
and $1,500 for port for pumpkins and it
has like 70% margins and this goes
massively viral we're talking 20 million
views across platforms and every other
comment was this is so stupid this will
never work this is so stupid this will
never work and like all the things I
posted about I've gotten more emails and
texts from people that have actually
started this and succeeded at it and
when I actually crunched her numbers she
had 1500 customers and across Houston
and Dallas there's 17 million people in
Houston and Dallas she had 1500
customers yeah that's nothing that's
nothing Million Dollar business it's
like we all over complicate you know
like you'll see so I everyone loves
inbound sales oh who doesn't love
inbound sales which really just a
function of good marketing right inbound
sales are just people responding to your
marketing outbound people like cold
email doesn't work cold calling doesn't
work I can promise you you're
unequivocally wrong cold emailing yeah
door knocking cold calls they do work
and the MH and the Jedi knows it and the

[16:01]
and the MH and the Jedi knows it and the
caveman knows it cuz the caveman says I
want to go sell pumpkin whatever
designing right I want to go sell tree
lighting I'm going to go knock on
neighbors door neighbors have home I'm G
you know I mean like I promise you to
that point you know you just go knock on
doors and you would close clients for
that 100% and the and the midwit by the
way in the email one for example for
anyone who's like watching that knows a
very specific stuff is like worried
about Demar records and who's that and
you know it's like
stop about how do you send 100,000
emails a month you don't need to how do
you sell 20 a day because here's the
reality sending 20 real cold emails a
day that are actually structured and
unique to new people is you don't have
to worry about inboxing you don't got to
worry you know I mean there's none of
that like it is going to work you know
it but don't spam 20 people at once like
hey do you want to buy my service I've
done a lot of cold Emil my point is to
bring this up is with one of the things
I have we're about to do a strong cold
outbound push and I've done a lot of
cold email before but it was not in this
way it was not sending 50,000 emails a

[17:02]
way it was not sending 50,000 emails a
month which is a different complex thing
but I used to sell $100,000 investor
relations packages ad packages for our
Cannabis News sites our financial news
sites in the Cannabis space you know
what we would do we go look at public
companies in the Canabis space I go look
at their IR contact and I would go email
them and make a deck for them this pre
canvas so it took a little more work we
make a deck email them and we had
basically a templated deck we' change
their logo you know and I'd say hey
would love to offer you this and you
email them and then you follow up and
you go to a conference and you try and
meet them and shake their hand and you
call them and maybe your sales cycle is
really six months instead of a one call
close which everyone wants to get
usually longer than you think yep
usually long you think but like looking
back on it and ironically bro I wasn't
even thinking of it that way I was just
a kid 28 years old and I was just like
oh that's how we're gonna sell that's
our customer right there I'm gonna and
now like I was a caveman and now I think

[18:00]
now like I was a caveman and now I think
oh it needs to be structured what CRM
are we use CRM I was using Excel you
mean it was you know I mean like yep it
was really simple we're using Apple
notes we're using Excel do exactly and
we were selling $200,000 packages that
way you know the only difference was
that we had like a unique offering that
we were presenting in a unique way right
which was IR to cannabis companies
through our you know the problem for the
I don't know you see it but my Instagram
DMS and my Twitter DMS the problem is
Brie story I used to work at nightclubs
sold this little ad Network when I was
20 all right if you are watching this
clip right now you are watching this on
YouTube and if you are a fan of podcast
please check out my podcast while you're
at it because sometimes I have podcasts
that aren't on YouTube and sometimes I
have YouTubes that aren't on podcast so
check out the ker office on any podcast
platform or you can go to TKO pod.com
also my newsletter will throw that in
there there are no ads It's weekly it's
different content than my podcast and
YouTube newsletter. chrisj cerner.com
You'll see the link and we'll see you
there blew that money in nightclub and
became a a club promoter from 2026 I
thought I was going to spend my life in

[19:00]
thought I was going to spend my life in
nightclubs and that's what I did and
remember one
point well I well I think probably
comedy tickets at Time Square at 15
which was which was the real
Hustle but we had I remember one time we
were selling bottles right you sell
bottle service this is a moment in time
where we I think the most me and my
partner ever sold on our table 88,000 on
our table in one night you see people
drop a million dollar about crazy moment
in history point is we were having a
difficulty with bottle sales and so I
was working at this club called one Oak
and I had this boss called Mark Mark
called me and all the other promoters
into the to the club and was like you
guys are having a hard time selling
bottles because you're all fishing in
the same Pond we had a bunch of
promoters who are going to the club next
door meeting people at that club next
door and saying come spend your money
here well now we're all fighting for the
same clients pitching them on the exact
same thing and they're already going to
go to the club next door so what I see
now in my Twitter DMS and Instagram DMS
is everyone is pitching me on short form
video editing and cold dming as for

[20:01]
video editing and cold dming as for
outbound I get I have three DMS a week
easily about short form video editing
okay stop pitching it to creators like
me or Chris I dude you got a bigger
audience than I do for sure on Instagram
I promise you you go you're getting tons
of those pitches right I don't even look
in there anymore but yes yeah because
it's because it's scary but I'm saying
go pitch that to just a totally
different audience is not getting
pitched that all the time and you're
much more likely to sell it it's not
even you have to have a different offer
right anyway although that does
contradict you're in my statement about
just copying fully it's got to be people
that are already paying for it but
aren't getting hit up for it as much
there's like a fine balance because you
don't want to go convince someone that
they need a post short form and that you
can edit it for them you need people
that are already believe in short form
but that aren't getting hit up all day
every day or James another thing I would
say is you need to find the same people
that you're dming on Instagram but cold
email them because if I'm getting hit up
in my DMs all day about short form video

[21:01]
in my DMs all day about short form video
editing but I get a cold email it's just
different there's the contrast is
different or like message them on straa
right you message them on some random
platform I love that yeah yeah 100% And
yeah yeah yeah send him send him a penny
you know send send him a penny I mean
I've seen people do that with PayPal
right you send him a penny with an with
a note attached to it or send him a
dollar with a note attached to it dude I
just have like this quotee I keep
repeating this week in my head is the
harder way is usually the better way
like making a deck by hand going to the
conference six-month sales cycle instead
of one that's just that's the mid what
meeme for me is like you know working
remotely is really sexy I love it but if
you want to optimize for wealth and
getting promotions you got to get in the
car and go through LA traffic you know
like the harder way is usually the
better way I'll tell you yeah I mean you
know the obstacles of the way some real
stoicism kind of stuff right I mean
really really I think to to go along
with that you touched on something that
I was really hammering home to a client

[22:00]
I was really hammering home to a client
I was doing consultant work for the
other day in person in person in person
in person when we we were doing $2
million a year in ad packages and yes
we're doing cold email and stuff but I
was also going to those conferences
those cannabis conferences and meeting
all those companies and shaking their
hands and talking to people like and so
if you're selling something that's two
three four $5,000 a month to go spend
two grand to go to a conference and go
shake some hands it's just a yeah a game
changer it's just a total people don't
want to do it you know so to your point
if I'm I'm much more likely to have a
conversation with someone that I met at
a party at a conference that I gave my
number to and had a good time with and
we were hanging out like dude we should
talk about marketing stuff sometime you
know like I'm much more likely dude
hopefully you're not going to pitch me
on this but if at the end if if a week
from now you hit me up you're like by
the way dude I just I perfect example I
do have a friend I don't want to mention
who you probably know him he's well
known on Twitter he buys businesses and
he bought the only short fir cont short
form editing service I've used ever was

[23:00]
form editing service I've used ever was
my friend bought an agency a short form
editing agency and he hit me up and he
was like hey man do you want to use it
and I used it for a bit right but
because now Chris and I actually have a
rapport you could go email me next week
and be like hey dude can I give you a
free week from editing from our agency
let me know if you like it you know be
like yeah sure run it let's go you know
yeah I'm not even recording right now
I'm just gonna sell you in a
week I bought a website from shout out
72-hour sites I think it's domain from
my you know from Sam and yep we were
texting this afternoon by the way also
by the way was one of the people the
group same group of people that had the
short form content agency that I was
using yeah I just Sam's cool dude you
know I mean like we've chat a million
times we chat about working together you
know what I mean like and then from
there they got me into I own an SEO
agency we don't do content normally we
do on page and backlinks and mostly
mostly back Ling building and he's got
another agency that's doing content you
know I mean I was like oh then it was
like oh do you want to try a fre month I

[24:01]
like oh do you want to try a fre month I
was like sure I'll try a fre month and
see if we can sell to our customers but
my point is I guess all this is like
it's just a little bit about Rapport
building a little bit in the beginning
doing yeah dude you know this comes back
to to go along with you just saying like
the hard way is the way it's like doing
the unscalable worry about scaling worry
about how to scale when you're at the
point that you cannot do of more than
what you're doing but but getting in
your own way and I do this myself
getting in your own way from starting
something worried about will scale and
not starting because you're like oh well
40 clients the margins are going to be
so bad you know I mean like worry about
that when you get there you know bro
will it scale you don't have any money
yeah scale you don't have any clients
what do you yeah what do you scaling you
know what I mean like you know worry
about reworking your business when you
get there you know in the meantime just
like just do it right and that's why and
this is going to sound so cheesy dude
but like everyone in the world knows
just do it everyone knows that slogan
it's so obvious duh but I cannot explain

[25:00]
it's so obvious duh but I cannot explain
it's like I used to be a Smoker smoked
the pack a day for a decade always
wanted to quit there's a saying that
it's quitting cigarettes eest thing in
the world done it a thousand times point
though is every time I quit cigarettes
you try you try you try but you can tell
I haven't smoked in years now I could
tell that moment when I really wanted to
quit I think it's true about all
addiction people you know you need to
quit drinking or quit whatever there's
an internal just oh it clicks one day
you're like it clicks oh I know what
this is it's like your rock your own
personal Rock Bottom yes and so what I
was going to say about just do it is
similarly it's like or it's it's
intuition it's like or it's like falling
in love like you can try to fall in love
but when it just clicks like oh my God I
love this person so my point about just
do it as a slogan the reason just do it
is the best slogan of all time is we all
get it just do it but the moment that it
really really click which was like even
just two years ago for me like just do
it like lit that Shila Buff thing just
do it like yeah the moment you get to
like truly truly truly just do it is
like how to accomplish any anything you
want in your life to go back to Sam me

[26:01]
want in your life to go back to Sam me
praying upon his downfall but like you
can just do things you know he said that
like you can just do things I love do it
you know but it's magic I had a business
partner that took this to the nth degree
we we'd be in there talking about a
problematic employee and we're like okay
what should we do we and then he would
just get this look in his eyes he would
just like transform and he's like he
wouldn't even say it he just picked up
his phone he's like hey you're fired
okay all right bye wow and I'm like but
like we both knew that was the call you
know yeah and it was the hard thing and
it was just a it was very much like a
Band-Aid moment and he would do that all
the time and it was so cringeworthy
because it's so foreign but it was so
admirable at the same time I mean it
reminds me there's a saying I heard
recently it's very applicable it's true
to relationship it's true to business
but it's like the longer you stay on the
wrong train the more expensive the
ticket to the right one is you know and
it was and it really true right like you
know the longer that you're in a

[27:00]
know the longer that you're in a
relationship you shouldn't be in the
much more difficult it's going to be to
end it and get back to the person that
you want to be with you know like you
know the longer you're in a job you hate
you know the tougher it is to get to
that right place so the long you know so
that's the saying I really like the
longer you're on the wrong train the
more I'm still processing that that's so
good it's a good one right it's a it's a
oh man it's so true it's so funny how
you can take a principle that we all
know to be true but you can just put the
right words to it and it just just
becomes so deep yeah yeah that's what I
feel about just do it right like and
it's you know just when when it clicked
from me that's what I'm talking about
when I said that to you and you were
like whoa right like it makes sense
you've heard you know that's what I mean
about just do it when just do it clicked
for me about like just do it and I can't
explain all I can do is keep saying it
out loud it it's sort of like Epiphany
it's sort of like having an epiphany
that's what it is it's sort of this like
aha moment right when it clicks
internally you can just do do things you
know you can just do it like the way to

[28:01]
know you can just do it like the way to
do everything I mean I hate to say and
we all have the same opportunity I hate
to say this but you and I can sit here
and I can talk about hundred billion
dollar Tech ideas that's was how we
started into businesses that you and I
think anyone could start in a weekends
the truth is in the digital world and I
could bring this to hands instead but we
all have the exact same keyboard bro we
all have the ex this is such a magical
device here the truth is is that Jeff
Bezos had the same keyboard as me and
you bro it it blows my mind sometimes if
I press the right buttons in a row in
this puzzle I think of a keyboard as a
puzzle and I think that if I just press
the right buttons in the right order I
can create a trillion dollars of wealth
and that's true and if I press the wrong
buttons it does nothing right and so
when I think about the businesses that
you and I have been thinking about
recently I'm positive or we're talking
about recently I'm positive if you just
press the right buttons and they're not
rocket science buttons right if you just
press the right button
you press the right buttons on this you
make the phone call you say the right

[29:00]
make the phone call you say the right
things and they're very formulaic right
that million $2 million a year is just a
formula it's out there and you know it
and you've seen it right and this is why
when it comes to courses and stuff for
example some people are like oh this is
a scam and other people like oh my God
this is so obvious right it's yeah
there's few things in the course that
are going to be like oh my God that was
magic that no one's ever heard of it's
very often just you know accountability
and pushing someone forward and and
giving them the path to follow but we
all have the same keyboard the path to
one or two million is not rocket science
you just press the right buttons you got
the same keyboard and mouse just press
and again this sounds silly but when I
distill it to that and I make it that
simple in my mind it's like you want to
build an agency you want to build you
know that that does a million dollars a
year well here's the only tool you need
to keyboard and if you press these right
yes you might have to press tens of
thousands on the right buttons in a row
but if you just press these right
buttons in a row for the right amount of
days you'll make a million dollars and
that is not even debatable it's just
true then it sort of becomes up to me

[30:02]
true then it sort of becomes up to me
just do it right then it comes to that
just do it anyway sorry that was my it's
like you no I love that and like you
start by going to your keyboard and
typing in youtube.com and twitter.com
and start following the right people
that are doing what you want to do and
you just start consuming content and
then you won't be able to get your hands
off the keyboard I have an app that
tracks how many words I type and I'm at
8611 words today wow 10,000 today like
I'm using this keyboard a lot I have
worn out the keys of this keyboard
people don't know what to type right so
you literally just you have to start
consuming the right stuff not like the
stupid prank videos that you you want to
not swipe on but you you start by
consuming the right stuff and then
you're naturally G to start typing in
the right stuff 100% you'll learn you'll
actually have a base to build from yeah
yeah I mean dude I mean that gets me
into a whole we could do a whole another
hour or another time on like
brainwashing yourself and really just

[31:01]
brainwashing yourself and really just
believe that like another midwit thing
which is that like mindset is the Jedi
and the kman are both like mindsets
everything and the midwit like that's
not possible and it's just like nah bro
mindset really is everything you know
and like it's really just I have this
sort of like little Spiel I've been on
recently about how belief is everything
even winning the lottery because even
when the lottery requires buying a
lottery ticket which means on sub
subconscious level you believe that it's
possible to win the lottery so you
couldn't even win the lottery unless you
believed you could win the lottery right
in this scenario so like having believe
you won't make a million dollars unless
you believe you can make a million
dollars I was once with a friend we were
in in New Jersey his family's friends
like boat by the Jersey Shore and
passing away this big $20 million houses
this 10 15 years ago and he's like I
want to live in one of those houses one
day and I was like okay so why don't you
make a plan to you I didn't have any
money at the time but he was like oh
well I'll never live in a house like
that I said him I was like not with that
attitude you won't you won't if you
believe that you will never live in that
house you literally will not you have to
at least I cannot believing is not what

[32:01]
at least I cannot believing is not what
will get you there but as a core
fundamental Baseline belief has to
underly all of it because without belief
there's no foundation in which you can
build anything on top so that's that's
this is why this is why pessimist sounds
smart and Optimist get rich rich yeah
100% to be to believe you have to be
optimistic you have to hope for a
brighter
future everyone in my comments are
they're pessimist but not everyone but
oh man this was good I like i l Al
literally have a headache right now and
that's always a good signal for how a
podcast went because I'm using my brain
all right what you think please share it
with a friend and we'll see you next
time on the ker office
