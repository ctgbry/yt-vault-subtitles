Porch Pumpkins might be the best
seasonal side hustle. Why? Because half
of every dollar earned is pure profit.
&gt;&gt; The package number one makes $1,350.
&gt;&gt; This Dallas mom of three, Heather, makes
over $100,000 of profit per month.
&gt;&gt; Our sales were just at $100,000.
&gt;&gt; Oh my gosh.
&gt;&gt; Not only that, but it's a very viral
business. It sells itself thanks to
social media.
&gt;&gt; My phone just kept going. Ding, ding,
ding.
&gt;&gt; And customers pay you upfront. That's
right. your risk is close to zero
because you collect all the money
upfront. Today we're diving deep into
the porch pumpkin business, how to find
customers, how to find cheap pumpkins,
and how to run this business without
going crazy. So without further ado,
let's meet Heather. Okay, so that first
year you officially launched, how did
that go? What was that like? What were
your sales and your order numbers?
&gt;&gt; So first year I thought that I was going
to, you know, just do 30. That was my
goal. And I quickly exceeded that in
like 4 days. We ended the 2020 season
designing and displaying 250 homes in

[01:01]
designing and displaying 250 homes in
the DFW area. Our sales were just at
$100,000.
&gt;&gt; Oh my gosh.
&gt;&gt; Literally, I was just thinking like, if
I can sell $10,000 in pumpkins, like
this will be great. I'll make this
&gt;&gt; Christmas money.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. It'll be great. And just
wow. The wildfire started.
&gt;&gt; How much of that would you guess was
profit that first year?
&gt;&gt; Uh the first year, I mean, we because I
was the labor. I was literally driving.
I was loading the pumpkins myself in my
Yukon. I was unloading the pumpkins
myself at the home. And then I was
designing. And so profit was like 50.
Our profit margin was 50%. At the very
end of the season, I did hire a new
driver and then two designers because I
did so much myself. I mean, my husband
was loading, you know, and
entrepreneurs, we don't pay ourselves
until everybody else gets paid and all
the job gets done. And so it was great.
&gt;&gt; So 50,000 of profit in like 2 months of
work. like hard work,
&gt;&gt; way less. This is entrepreneurs ask me
all the time, is it too late? Is it too
late to start this pumpkin business? And
my answer is no. It's not too late. Yes,

[02:00]
my answer is no. It's not too late. Yes,
it's too late.
&gt;&gt; If you wait, you won't do it,
&gt;&gt; right? If you wait till like the week
before Halloween, maybe it's too late
then, but even then, no. Get three homes
under your belt. You know, I started
September 27th. Like now, yes, I start
back in July collecting the orders, but
year 1, we started September 27th and we
wrapped the week before October 16th
because that's my youngest son's
birthday. So, I mean, two weeks. Yeah,
&gt;&gt; two weeks we just
&gt;&gt; And today you go you deliver all the way
until like October 17th or so.
&gt;&gt; Now we go through October 17th. So this
is the first year that I've opened four
weeks of delivery for DFW, which has
been so great. It's allowed us to be
able to take on so many more clients.
And then in Houston, we do two weeks of
delivery. And just based off of this
year's numbers, I will absolutely do
three weeks in Houston next year. So I'm
really excited about that. And then
Austin, it's our first year in Austin.
And so we are doing we offered two weeks
of delivery, but when we really like
looked at the numbers, it it's going to
end up being like a week's spat of time.
&gt;&gt; All right. So year 1 100,000, year 2,
three, what did those look like?
&gt;&gt; 250, 450, 650, 800, 1,000, 1250. Yeah.

[03:04]
&gt;&gt; 250, 450, 650, 800, 1,000, 1250. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So you you basically grew 50 to 80%
every year. 50 to 100%.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; That's insane.
&gt;&gt; Every year.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So would you say you're the
fastest in the company at design?
&gt;&gt; Oh, 100%. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah,
&gt;&gt; cuz that took like 15 minutes. And you
were kind of talking, taking your time.
&gt;&gt; So these on average take me 10 minutes.
&gt;&gt; So this is like a $400 job.
&gt;&gt; This is the package three. It just
doesn't have the hay because of the
stairs. So this is $600.
&gt;&gt; Oh, this is $600 job. What would you say
for this job your profit would be?
&gt;&gt; Roughly $300.
&gt;&gt; Beautiful. 50% margin. Not easy. I mean,
the pumpkins are heavy.
&gt;&gt; Not easy. And you know, we started with
a 50% profit margin. We dipped down and
we went back to a 50% profit margin
because we know how to source pumpkins.
Yeah. So, you're obviously not buying
these at the grocery store. What is the
big secret to sourcing these pumpkins?
&gt;&gt; The real secret is buying as many
pumpkins as you need for your season.
And so, the more pumpkins you need, then
you can get them direct from farmers.
&gt;&gt; When do you have to get that order into

[04:00]
&gt;&gt; When do you have to get that order into
the farms?
&gt;&gt; So, every farm is different, but for the
most part in Texas, like we're doing
pumpkin orders beginning of August.
&gt;&gt; All right. So, Heather, what first
inspired you to start decorating porches
with pumpkins? So, we used to live
across from the Dallas Operum and they
do this amazing display every year. It's
called Pumpkin Village. In fact, I was
just there yesterday with our designers.
We love it.
&gt;&gt; The amount of pumpkins they use is
insane. So, before I ever stepped into
Dallas Aubber, I would have like two
pumpkins on my doorstep to represent
Halloween
&gt;&gt; and all the fall things. And then I saw
&gt;&gt; what was possible.
&gt;&gt; What is possible? How beautiful it can
be. All the different colors and
textures. I was a one orange
jacko'lantern girl. the Dallas just
really inspired me to start buying and
bringing home like additional pumpkin
varietals. And so my first year that I
decorated at my home, I actually used
all orange jacko'lanterns. It's really
tacky. I should get you the picture so
you can see it. I went like crazy. I
probably had 50 orange jacko'lanterns in
my yard and then I had like probably
another 50 pie pumpkins.
&gt;&gt; And you would never dream of doing that.

[05:00]
&gt;&gt; And you would never dream of doing that.
&gt;&gt; And I would never do that now, but I
loved it then. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And I even got yard of the month and my
neighbors and my friends in there were
like, "Oh my gosh, it's the mini
Aubberum over here."
&gt;&gt; Did you just buy those at the grocery
store?
&gt;&gt; Uh, I would just pick them up from
different places. Like if you go to the
Aubberum, you can get some pumpkins. The
grocery store would have some pumpkins,
you know. So, I was never a pumpkin
patch person. Um, in Texas, it's really
hot. So, we didn't ever go to the
pumpkin patch and and do that. So, yes,
I was not buying them from a patch. I
just started getting more varietals and
bringing them to my porch and my
displays got a little better, a little
better. I had some trial and error. I
learned that pumpkins in landscaping
will rot faster. They'll still last a
pretty good while. And there's some
tricks that you can do to help them
elongate through the season. I started
putting most of my pumpkins on my porch.
Hence, porch pumpkin.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Not touching the ground.
&gt;&gt; Not touching the nature ground. Yeah.
So, I started decorating my own porch.
people definitely noticed how like cute
and pretty it was and how festive it

[06:00]
and pretty it was and how festive it
was. And so they asked like, "Can you do
this at my house?" And back then I I had
two young children, you know, they're um
18 months apart. And so the answer was
no. But once my youngest was in like
preschool, I just thought, you know,
maybe it's time to do something. Um I've
always I've always done something. I
started thinking about like, well, this
pumpkin business, how can I thing that
is scalable and easy? Well, I love
pumpkins and people have always asked me
to do pumpkins. I wanted them to be in
the packages. From there, I just created
packages. I created a flyer and kind of
the rest is history.
&gt;&gt; And I think that's important because if
you left it up to them to choose what
they wanted, like they don't know. And
that's confusion and that's friction and
that's like them just ultimately saying
never mind. But if you're saying choose
this, this, this, or this, then they
kind of they have a good direction,
&gt;&gt; right? And also as a business owner,
your time, you know? So they're like,
"Oh, I want this and this and that." And
then you're you're going to have to like
stop and cost that specific thing out
which takes more time. And now do I do
custom packages? Absolutely. They start
at $3,500

[07:00]
at $3,500
&gt;&gt; and they go up from there, but I'm happy
to do a custom package for anyone at
$3,500 or more. And that's just what I
figured out. Like that's the price point
that I need it to be for my time to not
just take the packages that I've already
created. Well, coming from the
restaurant world, imagine if there was a
restaurant that didn't have a menu and
people just walked in and like, I don't
know, maybe some tacos, some pizza.
Like, what would the kitchen do? So, you
have four packages now. Did you start
with four?
&gt;&gt; Well, I actually have the five packages.
Um, but yes, I started with four.
Package one, which is our largest, the
biggest. Um, it has the two grand prize
pumpkins, 10 large pumpkins, eight
medium pumpkins, four each of our
specialties. It comes with gourds, mini
pumpkins, and two big bales of hay to
create like monstrous display.
&gt;&gt; That's the Highland Park display.
&gt;&gt; That is the big daddy Highland Park
display. And you know, people ask me all
the time like, "What package should I
get?" So like even like looking at this
front porch, they could do any one of my
packages here. You can't really like So
be like, "Do you want to pack like are
you hosting a party? Do you have

[08:00]
you hosting a party? Do you have
something special going on? Let's do the
package one this year." But then the
typical this year could be the package
three and it's perfect. It's going to
have plenty of pumpkins to fill up the
porch. Yeah,
&gt;&gt; usually when people do ask me about
which pumpkin package to get, I'd give
them like two options and then I say
like and if you want to go really big,
you know, this a package one will fit on
your porch if you're looking for that.
&gt;&gt; Package one 1350
&gt;&gt; 1350.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Uh includes design.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Um clients can add on for us to pick up
the pumpkins at the end of the season
and take them uh we take them to a
pumpkin uh excuse me to a pig farm.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; The package two is $800. the grand prize
pumpkins. Like if we sell those
individually at$185 each. So if you
think about two of those, that's just
under $400, which that's kind of the
about the price difference minus the few
extra pumpkins that you do get with the
package one. And then the package three
is priced at 5.25. And our package three
and four. I wanted to create a package
where we could just drop off the
pumpkins for our clients to create their
own display. Had I had that option back

[09:00]
own display. Had I had that option back
before I started this business, I
absolutely would have paid for someone
else to just drop the pumpkins off and
let me be creative. I love being
creative and so it was just really
important for me to always keep that. So
the package three is $5.25, but then you
can add design for $75 and then the
package four is the smallest which is
$325 and you can add design for $75.
Okay. 95% of my clients do add design
for the package three and four. I was
thinking we were talking about designers
and like you should for people that
elect not to pay for your design, you
should say, "Hey, send me a picture of
what you do and maybe I'll hire you."
Right. Because that's that is kind of a
bottleneck is having good designers,
right?
&gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
&gt;&gt; Have you ever found a designer from a
customer?
&gt;&gt; Actually, yes. Really?
&gt;&gt; Uh one of my designers that start joined
the team last year, I was messaging her
to remind her to order and she's like,
"Are you hiring designers this year?"
And I said, "I sure am." She's like, "I
love getting my pumpkins from you, but I
like displaying them myself." Yeah.
&gt;&gt; She sent me a picture and I was like,
"You're done." One picture.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. So, it was It's been great,
&gt;&gt; guys. It's 93° right now. I spent

[10:00]
&gt;&gt; guys. It's 93° right now. I spent
thousands of dollars to film and edit
this video. And my only goal in life is
for you to start a business. So, if you
want to say thanks, all you got to do is
subscribe and or maybe share it with a
friend. It would mean the world to me.
When you're doing it, how is it done?
Are you the driver and the designer?
&gt;&gt; No. I used to be in years 1 and two. I
was literally loading these pumpkins in
the back of my white XL, laying all the
seats down, putting as much in as
possible, and I could do a whole package
two in the back of my car, or I could
fit four package fours.
&gt;&gt; How much does a package two and four
cost?
&gt;&gt; A package two cost $800, and a package
four, the base price is $325. If you add
design, it's 75. That's an additional
$75. So, for a total of 400.
&gt;&gt; Wow. So, in one Yukon, you could fit
$1,600 worth of revenue.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Wow. That's amazing. Backing up. It's
6:30 in the morning. Your days always
start this early during season.
&gt;&gt; During season, I get to the warehouse
every morning at 6:00 a.m. That way, we
can leave as early as possible. You So,
we work really hard to get as much done
during the daylight hours.
&gt;&gt; And you're losing daylight every day.

[11:00]
&gt;&gt; And you're losing daylight every day.
&gt;&gt; Every day,
&gt;&gt; but it's still better than year one.
Year one, we didn't have a website. You
know, my goal initially was to do like
30 homes. And so, I had no idea the
wildfire that was about to happen. I
would be driving around with my car full
of pumpkins. It was the third day I was
in business. My phone just kept going
ding ding ding ding ding. And I was
like, "What is happening?" We were
driving out to Fort Worth and he was
like, "Yeah." And he's like, "Oh, it's
this person wants pumpkins." And I'm
like, "What's their name? What's their
address? I don't I don't know anyone
over there."
&gt;&gt; And that was a big unlock. Like, I'm
selling to people I don't know.
&gt;&gt; I'm selling to people I don't know. This
is so exciting. And so, we got to where
we're going. We did all of our designs
for the day. And then like I responded
back like um I got the information I
needed and then I would be done for the
day at like 7:00 at night. I would then
go home, reach back out to these people,
send them an invoice, they would Venmo
me or pay online with a credit card like
old school like Quickbooks.
&gt;&gt; So you expected 30 orders, you hope for
30, and what did you get the first year?
&gt;&gt; 250.
&gt;&gt; Oh my gosh.
&gt;&gt; I know. I was just in the business of

[12:01]
&gt;&gt; I know. I was just in the business of
saying yes. I was like, you want to buy
pumpkins from me? My answer is going to
be yes. Let me figure it out. And so I
just kept saying yes. And I quickly like
I had Jackson that came on to help me. I
found a driver that could actually pull
a trailer and so I could do more than
like three houses of pumpkins at a time.
And I even found like two designers that
could help me in that first year. Okay.
&gt;&gt; And then you know we just built from
that.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Well, I'm going to have to ask you
later about how you find these customers
cuz that it wouldn't work with any of
that.
&gt;&gt; Got to have the customers and um I am so
thankful for all of our customers and
it's just it's amazing.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. So, we were just like up in
the front. That's today's deliveries,
right? And then this is like the
backtock where they pull it all from.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. The quick rundown is there's some
here and then on the back side of the
cooler there's a whole another huge
section. I don't like to run out of
things. This is again like
&gt;&gt; that's a very like advanced business
tactic is over orderering to not run
out. Cuz like if you think of a doughnut
shop, we'll give away donuts at the end
of the day because it costs like 5 cents
to make a doughnut. They sell it for a
dollar and so if they sell out then

[13:01]
dollar and so if they sell out then
that's free money that they just left on
the table. But if they have 300 left,
then that's like six bucks worth of
donuts,
&gt;&gt; you know?
&gt;&gt; And so doing that math, it's important.
&gt;&gt; And then I also know what you can no
longer get from a pumpkin farm
mid-season.
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. It's It's funny cuz I just
noticed like as we're filming, all the
pumpkins to the ceiling. I thought we
were just looking at this.
&gt;&gt; You got a lot of pumpkins going on.
&gt;&gt; Pie pumpkins come sacked by the pound.
And so you don't ever know exactly how
many you're going to get. And so like in
our packages, package four and three get
a half sack and a package one and two
get a full sack. And when we're out
designing like you don't know exactly
how many you're going to have because
like right now at the beginning of the
season they're bigger and as the season
goes on they'll get a little bit
smaller.
&gt;&gt; How does that affect your margins or
does it at all? Like do you put less
pumpkins on a porch if they're bigger?
&gt;&gt; No, I don't because I still go by the
each. And the other thing is is we pay
by the bin. So if you have smaller
pumpkins like we did last year,
&gt;&gt; you get more per bin.
&gt;&gt; You get more per bin. So then I just use

[14:01]
&gt;&gt; You get more per bin. So then I just use
a few more per home.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So it affects your design choices
but not your margins really. So if you
do I mean when you over orderer cuz you
overorder strategically. Do you just
send those all to the pig farm with the
old pumpkins too?
&gt;&gt; No, that's not the goal. The goal is to
sell them all
&gt;&gt; and like if I have to use this like in a
display, it's just like a bonus, you
know? It's not like as a grand price.
So, will you start to do more bonuses as
the season gets later if you kind of
look at your inventory levels?
&gt;&gt; If I need to. Yes. But usually when I'm
looking at my inventory levels and aside
from grandprise pumpkins, if I'm looking
at my inventory levels and I still have
enough pumpkins, like we will h we'll
have a weight list of 200 or 300 people,
we'll look at that weight list and we'll
just pull additional trailers at the end
of the season. So, right now we are
scheduled through October 15th, but I've
already planned on we'll have a full
route day on October 16th. Also,
&gt;&gt; do you do discounts for those late days
or no? It's just like No,
&gt;&gt; they wouldn't have a chance to order
anyway, right?
&gt;&gt; That's all they got.
&gt;&gt; Charge more.
&gt;&gt; They should have been earlier to place
the order, right?

[15:00]
the order, right?
&gt;&gt; Well, how long do they usually keep them
out
&gt;&gt; here in DFW? It's pretty interesting.
Like, people either want their pumpkins
gone on November 1st, the day after
Halloween, because they're ready to roll
into Christmas. Like, they're hosting
Thanksgiving, they want their pumpkins
there through Thanksgiving, and then
they really want their pumpkins picked
up the day after. But it doesn't work
that way because we have so many clients
that pick pumpkin pickup. Guaranteed
that we'll have the pumpkins picked up
by the Thursday after Thanksgiving.
Okay.
&gt;&gt; So within seven days we'll have them
picked up and we just pick them up in a
dump trailer. It's just loads and loads
of pumpkins and then we take them to the
pumpkin farm. Not pumpkin farm. Pig
farm.
&gt;&gt; Pig farm. Pig farm. Would you say that
people underthink the design aspect of
this? Like oh yeah I'll just I'll just
throw them up and
&gt;&gt; Yes. I think people don't realize like
how much goes into designing a display.
And you know what? It's okay. like if
that's someone else's aesthetic is to
just like do their own thing, then
great. But when it comes to like the
porch pumpkins method, there's a lot
that goes into it. And then like even
just when we're training our our new
designers, which we we've been blessed
with like really great creative people.

[16:00]
with like really great creative people.
And then, you know, they've done
pumpkins at their own house, but it's
not necessarily the Portkin way. And so
then like just teaching them some of
those methods
&gt;&gt; cuz they might have a beautiful design,
but it doesn't fit your brand. It
doesn't fit what you want. And that's
important.
&gt;&gt; Yes. It should look like I was at any
home. What percentage smaller would you
say your business would be if you had
crap design?
&gt;&gt; This is a luxury product because the way
&gt;&gt; the way you've positioned it
&gt;&gt; positioned the market and priced it and
like you have to order ahead. Like
luxury products require like really
great service and like a really great
aesthetic. And so if we didn't have good
designers, I would only still be a
single woman show.
&gt;&gt; And so that would be great. And there's
still a great profit margin in that. But
it's even better because I was able to
scale it.
Okay. This is Gustavo,
my number one drive man.
&gt;&gt; All right. So, we're sitting here on a
flatbed trailer and you've got six
orders on this.
&gt;&gt; Six orders. Yes.
&gt;&gt; Okay. And this is a package three,

[17:01]
&gt;&gt; Okay. And this is a package three,
right?
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; We've got I don't know 15 pumpkins in
here plus a bunch of small ones.
&gt;&gt; Well, no. We have about like 30 pumpkins
in here.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I'm not good at counting. So,
&gt;&gt; yeah. All right. And what does the
package three cost?
&gt;&gt; Package three costs $525 to be
delivered. If the client wants the
pumpkins designed and set up by us, they
add an additional design fee for $75. So
for a total of 600.
&gt;&gt; What percentage of customers roughly add
your design fee?
&gt;&gt; 95%.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So 600 bucks most of the time.
&gt;&gt; This because I know where this is going
today is $600.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; And then what does it cost to have them
pick back up?
&gt;&gt; For a package three, it cost $100 for us
to pick them up at the end of the
season. And what percentage of people
choose choose that?
&gt;&gt; 90% of our
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, $700.
&gt;&gt; $700. Here it is. But you give people
the option.
&gt;&gt; What are all the packages you have?
&gt;&gt; So, you have a package four that's $325.
You can add design for that one for $75.
You have a package three for $525, which
you can add design for $75. The package
two comes with design. It includes

[18:01]
two comes with design. It includes
design and that's um $800. And then the
package number one also includes design
and it's $1,350.
Lastly, we have an Oh my gourd package
that uh I have Oh my Gord. Um we have
three different colorways that you can
choose from on that. So they have like a
few different number of amounts of
pumpkins and that one's 750 and includes
design.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; We just got an increase in popularity of
like people that don't want the orange
pumpkins and so um that's a way for them
to to order those.
&gt;&gt; Is that just like a trend like the
trends are changing?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. You know, I have like all
neutrals. Also, if your home gets full
sun, the Oh my Court package does last
um really well.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So,
&gt;&gt; okay. Roughly, how much revenue is
represented on this one?
&gt;&gt; Roughly, we have six and the average of
a package three $3,600.
&gt;&gt; Okay. And this will take like half a day
to deliver.
&gt;&gt; Oh, no. Like 2 and 1/2 hours, 3 hours.
&gt;&gt; Wow. How are you unloading these?
&gt;&gt; Well, I have Gustavo. He's going to
unload them. And so he will use a

[19:02]
unload them. And so he will use a
wheelbarl for most efficiency.
&gt;&gt; All right. So four six hay bales, six
orders. Is it one per house or does it
not go like that?
&gt;&gt; Well, the package fours don't include
hay. People can add that on, but the
package threes include two bales of hay.
So there's some threes and some fours on
there. So some people added hay.
&gt;&gt; Okay. How long have you been doing hay
bales for?
&gt;&gt; From the very beginning.
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; I've always had a front porch that had
no steps. So our front porch is super
flat. And so I always use hay to create
height in my displays. And so when I
actually have clients that'll be like,
"Oh, I don't want any hay. I don't like
it." I'm like, "I really use it for
height to create like a nice display."
&gt;&gt; So you do it anyway.
&gt;&gt; Um well, I can if they say like, "Oh no,
but I really don't want hay." Then I'm
like, "Okay, I can take it off." If you
have steps on your porch, you don't need
the hay. So then at that point, that's
when I ask like, "Oh, do you do you have
steps? Do you not have steps? I don't."
&gt;&gt; And but this is a different supplier, I
imagine.
&gt;&gt; Yes. It's um also from Texas and um they
actually grow hay just for us.
&gt;&gt; Really?
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; That's cool.
&gt;&gt; I can't remember the exact number right

[20:01]
&gt;&gt; I can't remember the exact number right
now, but I can get that for you.
&gt;&gt; We go through a lot of hay.
&gt;&gt; What does a bail of hay cost
&gt;&gt; for the client? $35.
&gt;&gt; Okay. What do you pay for something like
this?
&gt;&gt; I think we pay $12.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Solid.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. So, aside from buying
pumpkins, what are your costs in this
business?
&gt;&gt; We have pumpkins. We have umbrella
insurance. We rent a forklift. We pay
for warehouse space. I personally own a
lot of trailers now. Now, we do require
our drivers to come with a truck and
trailer and a dump trailer because a
dump trailer is really efficient.
&gt;&gt; Is that for picking them all up?
&gt;&gt; For pumpkin pickup.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, if someone um wanted to start
this like cheaply, could they just get
away with a trailer or finding a driver
that has a trailer?
&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.
&gt;&gt; Can you store them outside?
&gt;&gt; You could. uh you'd want to cover them,
but
&gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. What about fuel costs? Is
that a big expense or
&gt;&gt; our drivers and our designers are
responsible for that? 999 employees.

[21:00]
responsible for that? 999 employees.
&gt;&gt; Okay. How do you pay your drivers and
your designers?
&gt;&gt; So drivers are paid hourly and designers
are paid um by the design.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Usually the businesses we create
are we're solving our own problems,
right? So you're your own customer and
you're the business owner. So you've
approached everything in this business
of like how would I think of it? Would I
want to be paid to do this? Would I want
to do design? would I want to outsource
that? People might think at first, well,
like I'm just one person, like why
should I build my business around my
needs or preferences, but that's the
demand. Like even if it's a sample size
of one, you're proving that there's a
demand. Whereas a lot of times people
approach business and like they're just
guessing from theory. Like what do they
want? They'd probably pay $150 for porch
pumpkins when you're like, they would
pay a lot more,
&gt;&gt; more, more, higher, higher. Right? I am
the average consumer. There are people
that spend a lot more. There are people
that spend less than I do. So when I
created these package sizes, I was
really thinking about like what do I do?
What do I think my friend Gar would do?
What do I think this person would do?
And you kind of go from there. And then
it is trial and error. But specifically

[22:00]
it is trial and error. But specifically
like charging what you're worth. That is
so important for me as a female business
entrepor. I'm going to make sure that I
am being paid adequately for the time
away from my precious family, my
precious children. Exactly. And I really
think anyone should because everyone
gets 24 hours in a day.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Sometimes people approach it like,
"Well, I know I could go get this job
for 18 an hour or so. I'll charge 20 an
hour." But the question is, like what
you said, how much would I need to be
paid to spend time away from my
children? Probably way more, right? So,
if you can't build a business at that
price, then maybe you shouldn't build a
business.
&gt;&gt; Your very first season, you could easily
do $30,000, maybe even $40,000 if you
got started now and got yourself out
there and really marketed yourself and
followed some specific strategy. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Um to get clients. So,
&gt;&gt; and half of that being profit roughly.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; So, two months of work, $10 to $20,000
of net profit first season,
&gt;&gt; right?
&gt;&gt; That's that's not like pie in the sky,
passive income, sexy YouTube numbers.
That's realistic.
&gt;&gt; That's a realistic number and it is not
passive income because you need in order

[23:00]
passive income because you need in order
to make that percentage, you need to be
working it. You need to be doing it. But
yes, it is absolutely attainable.
&gt;&gt; Well, passive income is a four-letter
word on this channel. So, we don't
believe in it.
&gt;&gt; Like, it's, you know, Yeah. It's like
gurus will sell the dream of passive
income to sell courses, but I don't
promise anything is passive income. I
don't think true passive income exists.
If you get to that point and you're
investing in stocks or bonds, it took a
lot of active income to get there, but
this is not that. Yeah. Um, customer
acquisition, that's like the hardest
part. What are your go-to tactics,
tricks, secrets of Instagram, short form
video, and all of that?
&gt;&gt; Instagram, I follow what is trending
now. And so on my Instagram, I don't do
silly. I don't do ridiculous. I don't do
all the funny trends, which but you
know, right now carousels are really
hot. And during my sell season, I made
sure that I was using a lot more
carousels than I would previously. Like
last year, I would just do a single
static photo because that's what was
doing better. And then also reels like

[24:00]
doing better. And then also reels like
so you have to follow what Instagram
algorithm is putting out there. And if
you just follow some different marketing
people on Instagram, they will literally
give you that information for free. You
just have to do a little bit of
homework. Yeah. So, that's a one big
thing.
&gt;&gt; Time lapses.
&gt;&gt; No, I mean I especially during sell
season, I'm not making time- lapses now.
&gt;&gt; You're too busy.
&gt;&gt; I'm too busy and sell season like I
don't have new pumpkins to create the
content with. So, I'm using some old
content. But, so Instagram follow the
current trends. But if I'm just starting
out, you can use social media, but the
fortune's in the followup. when they say
a comment on your Instagram or they
leave a a message in your inbox, you
have to follow up with them. I mean,
especially as a brand new entrepreneur,
you need to follow up and make sure
like, oh, coming back to make sure that
I can help you place your order. I
haven't seen your photo come through
yet. Like, you have to do the work. Get
those orders.
&gt;&gt; I mean, entrepreneurs like us, we're
eternal optimists, right? And so, I even
still I fall into the trap of I got 10
leads. I have 10 people that want my
porch pumpkins. I have 10 customers. No,

[25:00]
porch pumpkins. I have 10 customers. No,
not even close. If you follow up with
them maniacally, you might have seven or
eight. Like if you do everything right.
If you just like expect them to just
remember a week later and follow through
and start ordering, you might have one
or two, right?
&gt;&gt; So the follow-up is everything.
&gt;&gt; Everything. You can't just send an email
out like, "Oh, I know so many people.
I'm on this organization. I'm in." Like,
sure, you can send an email blast out of
200. You'll probably get three or four
orders and then everyone else you need
to follow up with.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Personally, oneonone.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. It doesn't seem scalable. It
doesn't seem as efficient, but it's much
more effective.
&gt;&gt; It is.
&gt;&gt; What about are you in the comments? Like
all over the comments
&gt;&gt; all the time. And that again, that's
because Instagram guru someone told me
that the first I don't remember the
exact minutes, but it's like the first
30 minutes that you post something, you
should be prepared to sit there and
reply to all the comments. And so I do
that. Yeah.
&gt;&gt; You know, increase my reach beyond what
we'll even see over the next week
because we are on a wait list now, but
we potentially go on a wait list so we
can make sure that we're filling our
routes that aren't completely full. I
can add more homes or University Park

[26:01]
can add more homes or University Park
homes.
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, season 1 you did 250 homes.
&gt;&gt; And I just think it's interesting that
you're saying 20 to 50 is realistic and
I love that cuz you're conservative and
you're not trying to but like you did
250. That's And people watching this now
have a blueprint, right?
&gt;&gt; True. I think I'm so conservative
because my goal was 30, you know? My
goal was 30. I thought that was a
realistic number. I am in DFW where we
have
&gt;&gt; 8 million people.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. 8 million people. And then I once
had someone tell me in a sales position
that I had like like a $200 order. And
so that's always stayed in my mind and
that's why I said yes to Prosper. That's
why I say yes to Fort Worth. That's why
I say yes to Lucas. I just have to put a
dollar amount on it. We go there. Like
how far are you in your area from a huge
population? Say yes. Go there and you
can grow. And just because I was the
first like 6 years ago to kind of create
this model doesn't mean that there's not
more room for everybody.
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah. People don't understand how
much the pie grows. Like as more people
see porches on pumpkins, they want it,

[27:01]
see porches on pumpkins, they want it,
right?
&gt;&gt; In a sense, more competitors is more
business for everyone, right? Whereas if
you were always only the only person
doing this, your ceiling is is somewhat
capped, right?
&gt;&gt; You don't have as much reach because not
as many people are seeing it,
&gt;&gt; right? So from 250 orders to you're
creeping up on 1300 this year.
&gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
&gt;&gt; That's incredible. And this is like the
beginning of year six, right? Season
six.
&gt;&gt; Beginning I call it season six. It's
tricky, but
&gt;&gt; Okay. How much like profit do you think
you'll make this year?
&gt;&gt; I think our percentage margins will be
anywhere from 50 to 55%.
&gt;&gt; That's incredible. Hundreds of thousands
of dollars.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; That's incredible.
&gt;&gt; Two months of very concentrated work
September through the end of October and
then there's another like month and a
half of part-time work.
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; That goes into it. Okay.
&gt;&gt; At this scale, at this level,
&gt;&gt; that's like that's what's so interesting
about this business is season one
$10,000 profit a month for two months,
right? Season six. Not saying results
are typical, right? Over a hundred
thousand per month of profit. That's
that's incredible. It's not often that I
meet people that didn't just start a
business, but started a whole industry,

[28:00]
business, but started a whole industry,
a a pumpkin movement, if you will.
&gt;&gt; How does how does that feel?
&gt;&gt; It feels incredible. At first, I didn't
really understand the magnitude and like
really feel the magnitude, but
especially this year with some of the
conversations we've had and so many
pumpkin entrepreneurs like just across
the US that truly have like tagged me or
sent me a DM to like say like, I started
my business because of you. I saw that
you were doing this in DFW and I wanted
to bring this to my own city or town.
Thank you. And so I realized like I did
create an industry. Yeah. It's it's
exciting and I'm I'm thankful for it and
it just I think it's so great for so
many people to be able to have a
flexible income and do this. And there's
some people that are doing it beyond
pumpkins and they're doing they're going
to plan and do Christmas and holidays
and and that's wonderful. That's another
option. But the pumpkin porch like
decorating Yeah.
&gt;&gt; started here in Dallas.
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it did with you. I think a lot of
people are watching this and they're
go-getters and they're going to go out
and try it. Maybe they'll fail, maybe
they succeed. Some people want a little
more help, more handholding support.
What do you offer people?
&gt;&gt; So, I offer um two different things. One
is I offer business coaching. Business

[29:00]
is I offer business coaching. Business
coaching happens in the spring. So
obviously I'm really busy taking care of
my own business right now in the fall,
but January 2026 business coaching
courses are available online. They're in
person. They're Zoom. They're very um
specialized to the unique person and
they're 2 hours. So two 1-hour sessions.
Those will be on my website starting
January. And I do those through June and
&gt;&gt; on porchpumpkins.com.
&gt;&gt; On porchpumpkins.com. And then the most
exciting part is we are going to be
offering franchises this spring.
&gt;&gt; Wow.
&gt;&gt; And so we've done 90% of the leg work uh
was ready this past year, but we are
going to do the finishing touches and
getting that ready. And we cannot wait
to see um how many towns will actually
have a Porch Pumpkins in it operating
under the Porch Pumpkins brand. And with
all of our training and all the
resources and all the information that
we've learned along the way, we can't
wait to share that with other people.
Well, people will have like protected
territories if they have a franchise,
right?
&gt;&gt; Yes, absolutely.
&gt;&gt; That's incredible. Um, and that'll be
ready by 2026 season.
&gt;&gt; Yes, that will be ready for the 2026
season.
&gt;&gt; Okay. And they can learn more at

[30:00]
&gt;&gt; Okay. And they can learn more at
porchpumpkins.com there as well.
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; Okay. I meant to ask you when we were
talking about Instagram, do you ever put
paid ads behind your organic stuff?
&gt;&gt; I don't know how to do that.
&gt;&gt; Okay, guys. Starting a business is hard.
It's even harder when you have a 50%
co-founder that doesn't pull their
weight. So, do yourself a favor. Check
out TK Owners. It's a community of over
500 people that I'm a part of only for
business owners, entrepreneurs, and
entrepreneurs. Especially if you're a
female entrepreneur or a mreneur. We
have pods specifically for women led
businesses or women led aspiring
businesses. So, come check us out at
tkowners.com and you won't regret it. I
know like you're not hurting for
business, but if you were to take your
most viral organic post
&gt;&gt; Oh, paid like where I do a boost.
&gt;&gt; Yes, I do that.
&gt;&gt; Do you boost it to like a specific zip
code and that works? Yes, I tell that in
my business classes.
&gt;&gt; Are there any farms that you like or
prefer?
&gt;&gt; Oh, I love a farm, Pumpkin Pile in West
Texas employee data. They are amazing.
They're a family, multigeneration family
working together and they put out
beautiful pumpkins. They do a great job.

[31:01]
beautiful pumpkins. They do a great job.
Their communication's great. Their
website's easy, but they do a great job
and we we love them.
&gt;&gt; Pumpkin pile. Ple, right?
&gt;&gt; Ple.
&gt;&gt; Okay. And this is not an ad. We're not
being paid by them to say this. Is there
do you recommend someone starting with a
farm or starting with like a distributor
or
&gt;&gt; there's just different ways to go about
it? I mean you can purchase pumpkins
from a nursery. They are going to be
like the bottom level of ease where to
get pumpkins and get quality and
variety. And then you could pick like a
middleman type person. That would be
like a produce distributor.
&gt;&gt; Okay, let me just see if I get it. So
the very very like the worst but most
accessible option is just going to the
grocery store and that's not scalable.
you're not really going to be very
profitable,
&gt;&gt; right? And you're only probably going to
be able to get three or four varietals
from that.
&gt;&gt; Okay? And then one up is the nursery.
&gt;&gt; A nursery. Pumpkins are going to be a
little bit more expensive, but you're
going to have likely really great
quality and you're going to have a great
option of pumpkin variety.
&gt;&gt; Okay. And then up from there is like a
grocery distributor or or a broker or is
a broker one up?
&gt;&gt; Yeah. No, like a pumpkin broker because
they're still they're a middleman.

[32:00]
they're still they're a middleman.
They're not the farmer.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And they're going to mark it up.
&gt;&gt; And they're going to market it up.
They're they're going to make money for
helping you get those
&gt;&gt; pumpkins. Yeah. And that's how you
started. Yes, absolutely.
&gt;&gt; Okay. And then up from there, you go
directly to the farm.
&gt;&gt; Directly to the farm. And then this
year, we brought in 2018 wheelers or we
will bring in 2018 wheelers directly
from farms.
&gt;&gt; Yeah. That's a lot. That's a lot of
pumpkins.
&gt;&gt; It is. It is.
&gt;&gt; So, what percentage of like all of the
secret sauce would you say we cover
today? Cuz I think people are like us
entrepreneurs, we're overoptimistic.
We're overconfident sometimes. Of
everything there is that you know about
this business. What percentage did we
cover in this video?
&gt;&gt; I mean, we haven't been together that
long today. I don't know like
&gt;&gt; 10%. maybe 15 max. Okay. But there's
just so much there's so much that goes
into it and like yes, astute, smart
people that have the brain for it and
the eye, they can kind of pick apart
some some pieces and I was happy to
share, but there is so much more to
making this business work, make it easy
and make it flow from the very
beginning.
&gt;&gt; Okay. Porchpumpkins.com
