everyone's ignoring Facebook they have 2.1
billion daily active users facebook is paying
creators like me 20 cents per thousand views and
it's substantial because they don't have enough
good content you go to folks who are generating
content and say "Hey I'm going to publish it for
you in a foreign language and I'm going to put
the revenue 50/50 you need a $50 a month account
and you're in business." These implementers
will charge up to $10,000 per day ai replaces
the US implement old timey photo booths you just
freaking get bar owner on the phone buy them from
China and you place it that's it gold panning or
gem mining that is just a great business people
are super hungry for in real life experiences
so I like this [Music] one welcome to the Kerner
office today is a business idea showdown i had
my good friend Michael Girdley on the pod today
he owns a bunch of cool businesses like I do
and he brought a list of genius business ideas
and my challenge was to take his idea and level
it up on the spot with no prep at the end of the
episode we vote on our best and most favorite idea
this is quite entertaining i promise you're going

[01:02]
to love it please enjoy all right so there
is a huge problem where you do not know if
what you're looking at online is AI generated
photos AI generated text like you have no idea
so basically what I want to pay for is a service
that sits in my browser and basically it's a
plugin and it watches everything I'm looking at
and it flags for me stuff that is highly likely
to be AI generated this may already exist
but I would pay like 20 to $30 a month for
this service so it's a browser plugin that auto
detects everything I'm I'm looking at and tells
me if it's AI whether it's on a website or in your
inbox anything on your screen anything even video
even videos that's going to be a thing like I
don't know if it is or not yet but that's for
sure going to be a thing i think it is that should
be a big thing because what's real and what's fake
how will we ever know you don't like until you buy
my browser plugin coincidentally I might as well
announce my next product it's a browser plugin oh
and I think I think it could have a cool name you

[02:03]
call it something like distrust like I distrust
everything i like that i could see that being
like a whole category like I could see there being
hundreds of browser plugins and there being like a
governing body with like a a benchmark and it's
like what is your benchmark 97% accurate 80 you
know what I'm saying they kind of have those for
the LLMs but it would be something similar for
detecting LLMs either you're being really nice
or I'm starting out strategy no no I'm being No
I I will preface like I love every idea because I
firmly believe that any business idea could work
like with the right marketing the right ideas
it could work so I am a yes man when it comes
to ideas but this one I really like because
everyone's talking about browser plugins that
watch what you do so you could create SOPs you
could train other people it could tell you how
to be more productive that's where I thought you
were going with this i was like "Okay I've heard
this one." And then of course they have apps there
rappers where you can paste something into it and

[03:01]
say "Yeah this was generated by chatg right?"
But this is like passive and it just exists and
maybe there's like a meter on the corner of your
screen or something that flashes when it sees it
or highlights it you know yeah yeah like it could
kind of like highlight put stuff like with a red
glow over the top of it it thinks it's fake yeah
okay okay i like it and you know what i'm gonna
take that idea and I'm gonna build on that for my
idea let's go okay okay so I think there should
be like some sort of a governing body like just
like I said like an authority for detecting AI
generated content and the the idea here is for
all of these apps rappers whatever to pay you
a licensing fee or a yearly fee or a monthly
fee to get graded and scored and it could kind
of be like like what are those seals that you
have on the bottom of a website to that it's
like SSL certified or whatever something like
that some sort of a governing body someone to
raise their hand and say "I'm the authority."
You know uh Greg Eisenberger was talking about

[04:04]
how he moved to Miami he needed a dentist he was
walking around he passed a dentist and they had a
sign in the window that said voted Florida's best
dentist and he walked in and he's like good enough
for me he became their customer he sent dozens of
friends there and he said that one sign just from
him alone caused like tens of thousands of dollars
worth of business and so we had talked about that
like what what sort of a governing body could
you be and it's all a racket right but I think
this would be a good thing to attach that model to
what do you think i think your path is to go get
somebody in the in Brussels in the EU government
to mandate this as a requirement kind of like all
that horrible cooking somewhere very liberal yes
someone willing some Well it turns out it's all a
big barbell because you and I both live in Texas
and our state government is now also banning pot
which is like it's like oh yeah which is like a
big uh it's it's a big barbell at at the far left

[05:01]
and the far right in the middle they just meet
so it's it's funny I dig that so you have like
a governing body so be like C Labs or one of those
like ISO 90001 but it's for Exactly because on one
hand it's like if you don't think about it deeply
enough you're like yeah but who am I like why am
I anything special like what but all of these
governing bodies just kind of raised their hand
one day one guy was dumb enough or cocky enough
to say I can be that pay me money you know like
that's all it takes so I like that one that's good
okay so that's two are you keeping track of these
or should I open a Google doc i've got my list
and I'm writing down yours as they come up okay
perfect okay so I had one that I think is totally
up your speed which is I saw this tweet the other
day where people took a picture of this place like
outside I think Time Square in New York and it was
a place that had a bunch of oldtimey photo booths
and people were lined up around the corner to go
do these things and I went to a bar here in San
Antonio the other day well you know because I'm

[06:04]
old so I only go to bars on Saturday nights and
from the hours of 6:00 to 8 and uh they had the
old timey kind of photo booth and like it was just
a fascinating kind of thing that these things are
like super duper coming back i think there's
total market for people to start to build like
on these oldtimey photo booths and start to put
them everywhere because I think people are hungry
for this stuff because it's just the opposite of
what you get from the photo in a mobile device
that shows up on Instagram it's like the the
pendulum going the opposite direction totally
right have you been to like Pigeon Forge Branson
one of those those places too classy for me
have you been in one of those i have not been to
Pigeon Forge now oh if you We were at Pigeon Forge
a few months ago and there's probably a dozen of
these photo booth businesses for oldtimey western
photos on like all on Main Street and they're
retail spaces and like who knows what they pay

[07:03]
for rent right like probably 10,000 plus a month
it's crazy rent and I I'm assuming they do well
because there's a lot of competition and they
don't go anywhere like they've been there for
years so I'm just assuming they do well and
so that is my data point of why I love this
business because I think that speaks to uh a
bigger framework which is like take a business
that thrives in like a tourist trap area and test
it in with like a fraction of the cost in other
areas like a bar in San Antonio or a kiosk in
a mall it might flop it might only be a tourist
type attraction but it might not so I love that
how was it doing this one in the bard were people
attending it well number one here are two signs
number one I tried to talk my wife into doing it
she's like "My hair isn't it isn't our night."
So I was like "Cool." But then the wall was just
covered with hundreds if not thousands of people
that had done these and given them to the bar to
put on the wall wow okay that was pretty cool so
people are doing it yeah it's It seemed pretty

[08:05]
popular and was it just like your standard photo
booth that just had that filter on it basically
like it was the old school kiosk one that used to
have like the Kodak like film printer Polaroid in
there yeah it's precisely that that is cool okay
yep i like that one a lot should we come up with
like a grading scale for these should we write
down our own grades like privately so we don't
bias each other we could grade them if you want
but I figured we just at the end would just pick
the finalists okay that's good that's good all
right uh well I'll continue in this tradition and
I'm going to take your theme and I'm going to add
an idea to that same theme tourist traps i've got
four kids every time we go to one of these hokey
places our kids always want to do gold panning or
gem mining okay and that is just a great business
because you get a pile of dirt you kind of mix in
some cheap gems that kids think will make them
millionaires that were really worthless and you

[09:03]
pay like $45 for a bag this big and the kids
just have a blast and no one feels ripped off
the kids are entertained they're they're panning
for gold and you know water's filtering through
these things i think someone needs to take those
take that concept and shrink it down and put it in
like a hightraic shopping mall like the Gallery of
Houston or the Gallery of Dallas because it's very
visual every kid walking by is going to want to
know what's going on uh you can do like a prize
thing where like one in 10 bags have a gold
nugget or an Amazon gift card or whatever and
then when someone wins you could like advertise
that you could have a TV showing like it's just
the type of business that would get people to
stop in their tracks and shell out 35 45 bucks
and if it doesn't go well you just close up shop
because those kiosks are monthtomonth and you just
say "I tried what do you think?" I dig that one
so here's how this works i make you free videos

[10:02]
i actually know what I'm talking about i have no
greasy sales pitch at the end and if you implement
what I talk about you'll make a lot more money and
have a better life and all I ask for in return is
that you hit the subscribe button and maybe even
the notification bell just like that thank you
well and I think it's really in no pun intended
right yeah so an interesting trend right we talked
about the pendulum of like consumer demand uh
my son is having his birthday today and he is
going with his buddies he turned 16 so nobody can
drive so everybody's mom is dropping them off at
the mall it's just like whoa here we are again
we're we're back to the other end of the other
end of the you know the cycle again of repeating
itself which is a decade ago nobody wanted to go
to the mall now my kids are like "Yeah we're going
to go to the mall they have like a little arcade
there we're going to hang out with our friends
it's going to be great." So I think I I'm very
pro this as an experiential thing i think people
are super hungry for in real life experiences so
I like this one i think it's a cool one so would
you have like running water so you like do the
Yeah so I actually did a little um some research
on this like six months ago and there there's

[11:04]
like one or two companies that sell these setups
they're like5 to $15,000 and they're big enough
to fit in a like a mall but they sell them to like
these touristy places they're not meant to be in a
mall but they could be like if you if you could
have Orange Julius like all you need is a drain
and a plug then you could have something like
this right right it does remind me of the last
time I saw one of these little mining operation
things was we went to the dinosaur museum it's up
I think I think it's southwest of where you guys
are towards like Dinosaur Valley National Park i
mean it's Glen Rose Texas and they uh but on the
way there you drive past the Creation Museum which
is super fun but more barbell right yeah it's like
uh here if you want to get to this dinosaur museum
you got to go go past the the museum of Noah's
Ark which I try to get my wife and kids to go to
they're like we don't want to go there we want to
see the dinosaurs is what it is i like the malling
operation i think that's a cool one all right
okay so I'm going to get a little more little

[12:04]
more niched on here okay okay so one of the things
that I I think is a struggle is you have so many
of these businesses now that are small businesses
that like the only two options for them are like
sell the business to and sell the whole business
or like find a family member to take it over right
those are kind of the two options you can have
and eventually like the family member buys it out
so I think there's an interesting thing to kind
of replicate what happens at the bigger end of
the spectrum on business buying and generational
transition which is like come up with a model
where you become a fund that goes in and does
minority investments in these businesses so like
minority buyouts so say for example somebody has
a good business right let's say they own a chain
of small mining kiosks at the mall right and
that's that's doing a certain amount like this
company could go in this fund would go in and do
a minority purchase of say 40% of the business

[13:03]
and the way they would get paid back as like a
preferred return and then there would be guard
rails on the kind of broader thing right to keep
the people from paying themselves everything in
terms of salary and all that kind of stuff so
it's a halfbaked or maybe like a third baked
idea but like I just see so many businesses where
they're not ready to sell the whole thing but they
want to get like partial liquidity and take some
chips off the table and this is done for bigger
businesses but nobody's really tried to do it
for small businesses so tell me why this sucks
is there is there a revenue range that you're
thinking yeah I think it's stuff that is like
slightly bigger than SBA size so like enterprise
value rise you're like in that five to 15 million
EV type thing you know where maybe the thing's
throwing off two or three million a year in Ibida
like then you just say "Okay well we're gonna buy
one of those IBIDA from you for cash and here's $6
million for it and we're gonna get this prep and
then if if there's an exit then we're going to
get you know this percentage of the business at
exit right?" And go from there so that's that's

[14:01]
the total extent of the thing was like okay so
many people are trying to chase all these total
buyouts like why don't we go to people and just
say hey we're going to buy a minority thing you
can keep owning this and then over time like you
just take some chips off the table because when
people start what I'm seeing in this for me too
like you start getting 50 55 like you don't want
to have 98% of your like net worth tied up in
a plumbing business that you own like you would
love to have 60% of your net worth there you're
not ready to retire but like you you don't want
to have everything dependent upon this one thing
that could go wrong you know in a downturn that
sort of thing i like that idea i'm wondering if
you should pick like a niche like home services
or like only HVAC or anything and maybe your niche
quote is like having a 20 like a Lindy niche right
like you want it to have been around for 20 or 30
years you want to see a consistency of management
you want to see double digit net margins and
if it fits if it checks those boxes you don't
care if it's a restaurant or home service right
yep i like that idea i I wonder what it does to

[15:06]
like on a from a mental perspective to the owner
does he pseudo check out does he does it change
the dynamic of his motivation or his drive or
not maybe it makes him fight harder you know
it totally could yeah and I do think it it comes
down to a lot of potentially an adverse selection
problem with this idea which is you know hungry
people who are driven like yourself are the ones
that build great businesses like grit matters
right and if you want to be spending more time
on your boat that's not good for building
a bigger business so that could be kind of
the adverse selection problem with the whole
thing in the end I think you go look at like
Warren Buffett's writings when he was you know
really excited about the business he bought like
Nebraska Furniture Mart like he talks about that
lady that ran it like just a total machine and
when she didn't get what she wanted she opened
up a competing business across the street like
that is just like that crazy grit that you want
so I think for some of this to work you there has

[16:01]
to be the right people involved because the
smaller the business is the more it's wholly
dependent upon the caliber of the management and
the ownership so yeah isn't there like a test that
you can take that measures your grit have you
heard of that uhuh what is it i don't remember
what it's called but it's like pretty popular
grit i thought it was called owning a restaurant
i think it's Angela Duckworth the grit scale she
wrote the grit book i Yeah I think she has like a
test on her website and so maybe if we learn that
that is like a key component of whether you're
successful or not post purchasing this minority
stake they have to score a certain way on that
grit test and if they don't then you don't even
move forward with due diligence if they do then
you keep going i like that idea is that kind of
the percentage ranges that Warren Buffett buys in
for i think it's all over the place he's done 100%
buyouts there's been some stuff where they've done
60% buyout there's stuff where they've done you
know Okay owning single digits it just depends on

[17:04]
the situation interesting i like that idea that's
a good one should I build on that one again if
you want to riff on that one go ahead i'll try so
most people don't realize that of all those sweaty
startups like boomerowned businesses like we're
all enamored by the silver tsunami 10,000 every
day yada yada yada most people don't realize that
the vast majority of these businesses will just
be closed some of them will try to sell maybe
they half-heartedly post something to Bisby by
sell or they reach out to their cousin who they
heard was a business broker but he's really a
residential real estate broker and he's probably
garbage there might be a half-hearted attempt and
frankly shockingly many business owners don't even
know that selling your business is a thing that's
possible right like who would want this like
I'm just a stylist who would want my you know 75
hairdressing customers they don't realize there's
a value there it might be low but there is a value

[18:01]
there and so here's my idea call it like an online
marketplace like a biz by sell but specifically
for business owners that have already resigned in
their head to just lock the doors and walk away
and then opportunistic people you or I could come
in and say "All right I don't really want to start
a business i want to start from something i want
a foundation i want to book a business i want a
warehouse with a bunch of woodworking equipment
in it something I want to step into something."
and you maybe you pay $5,000 for an email list or
$50,000 for an email list or maybe you take over a
lease or maybe it's just a real estate transaction
but it's specifically biz by sell for people it
would be hard to grow this i think you'd have to
educate them but for people that have just said
I don't think there's anything here if there is
please tell me maybe it's an auction system like
an eBay style what do you think i dig it so it's
almost like biz by self but for special situations

[19:01]
are you familiar with that phrase like special
situations no from like a business i don't think
I've heard that yeah so the deal guys refer to
special sit special situations as like distressed
assets turnaround assets stuff cancer stuff with
one customer like just like oddball stuff that's
just like a special substant bankruptcy like
that's special special situations i may get
brutalized by defining this incorrectly but it's
kind of that thing where it's just like hey we've
got this random thing like it's just like you know
it is a a twothirds interest in Michael Jackson's
like music catalog like special situations kind
of stuff where there just the context is really
bizarre so I like it because that's where there's
just that's part one of the challenges of BIS by
sell is so much of it is just stuff that's like
down trying to be down the middle of the fairway
because that's what everybody thinks is going to
sell and you see a lot of deals and we see them on
our podcast Acquisition Anonymous that talks about
like these deals that we dig into them and they're

[20:00]
a special situation there's something screwy going
on but they try to post it like it's a down the
middle of the fairway deal so like I like this
like just like random hey here's this random weird
thing that you should think about you know yeah
and honestly I've scraped Biz byell before and you
can see how long it's been listed right you could
get your first listings by just finding all the
ones that have been listed for 365 plus days and
say "Hey we both know the score here come on over
here." People are actually looking for pieces of
garbage like this business yeah I like it oh man
that's a good one okay I got that one down in my
list here okay you want to hear my next one okay
so you're familiar with EOS yep okay so EOS for
those of you not familiar is a entrepreneurial
operating system it's a it's a system of templates
and rules and processes that you use to run your
business better and it's got all these different
things just business bait by numbers even so they
give away the book basically for free it's like
15 bucks that shows you the whole system you can

[21:00]
download all the templates you can do it yourself
what's that traction it's called track great book
yeah traction so basically even despite all
of that some companies still go out and hire
consultants to help them implement the system in
their business and they're called implementers
they are franchises of the EOS system the reality
is these people act very much like an AI does they
know their rules they know what you're supposed
to do they listen to what's going on and then they
say "Oh here's how to think about this rule." Okay
so the idea Oh here's where it gets worse these
implementers will charge up to $10,000 per day
to come work with your company $10,000 per day so
some of them are cheaper but like they charge big
money have you ever used one indirectly yes i've
been paid a couple times to help people do it i've
done it a couple if people are like "Hey you want
to go pay if you want to pay me $5,000 to hang
out with you for a day?" I'd say yes that's the
way it works same so I've done that but basically
all you're doing is like you memorize the book

[22:04]
understand how it works pay attention to what's
going on and then just be like "Okay guys like
do this other thing." Here's the idea you go take
chat GPT you give it the book and you say "Your
job is to act like the world's best implement
of EOS here's all the documentation on it read
it and you're going to log in to the Google Meet
and you're going to participate in this meeting
and you're going to act like the impleer and
facilitate us for the day doing this particular
thing." Wow and instead of it being $5,000 a
day it ends up being $250 a month to be an EOS
implement ai replaces the EOS butter so all right
logistically what does that look like on a Google
Meet like are you just getting the transcript
and then uploading it to are you using the API
to listen in real time so I think the software
to be built here is bridging in into Google Meet
like acting like a participant in the Google Meet
and pretending to be a human even though everybody
knows that you're the AI and you're not going to
have you're just speaking via audio and listening

[23:03]
to the audio of everybody else going through
the day of the planning sessions and stuff like
that so yes bridging an AI bot that like doesn't
audio interface into Google Meet like you just
bridge those two things together yeah okay okay
I'm just trying to think how would you interact
with it would it just be like a chatbot and you'd
say like based on everything we said what are
your suggestions and it's just scanning the book
and saying "Yeah it's got it knows all the rules
it knows there's a strict set of templates they
follow you know typically the way an implementer
like this works is they're running you through a
structured day where your team meets to talk about
what your goals are and all that kind of thing and
then the impleer is kind of being a participant in
that and then guiding people through the process
of following those steps so like everybody would
show up and then you be you basically treat the AI
implement like it's a human being and be like okay
like start us on our day okay well the first step
is we're going to do this and like the AI would
tell you that's big thing i think the techn is
all there to do this yeah it is man that's that's

[24:06]
going to happen like that's another idea that it
will be done who's going to do it when how will
it be rolled out i like that a lot so video
is cool but you know what's better long form
audio via podcast and my newsletter tkopod.com go
there to subscribe for free to my newsletter it's
one email a week very tactical and then go to my
audio podcast three episodes a week stuff like
this you're going to love it all free no sleazy
sales pitch tkopod.com i think the one downside
that comes to mind is accountability like does the
business owner really feel beholden to a chatbot
whereas if it were a real imple it's a real person
like "Hey man what are you doing?" you know like
you're paying me all this money you're not doing
the thing surely there's a way to bridge that gap
like to to pair it with a real human maybe like 10
to one instead of one to one you know well and and
ultimately I've seen people hire impleers like
this because they feel like they can't manage the

[25:01]
process and they're not their leadership is like
struggling like they can't get their people to
speak up or they feel like they need a third party
to do this stuff for them it's like uh that's more
of a sign of bad leadership than it is like a
sign of needing an impleer if that makes sense
so I think part of it also is if a CEO isn't ready
to listen to an AI and get feedback from an AI
that's a sign that you're not very coachable and
you probably have some bigger problems than what
solve for you okay i like that idea a lot and I'm
going to give you one along that same vein okay
wait are you thinking these up as you go along
or you pulling them off a list no I really Oh you
don't have a list no you're just riffing on these
i'm ripping this is great this is my superpower i
spent 30 minutes coming up with these ideas last
well mine I'm not saying it's going to be good
but I have it all right so there needs to be an
AI focused EOS like EOS needs to be reborn a new

[26:04]
company entirely but AI first right just like
Instagram was successful because it was mobile
first Facebook was was not right so here's what
you do you take the same thing you take a PDF of
the book Traction upload it to Claude or whatever
you need a big enough context window and you say
"Here's chapter one of Traction i want you to
take the first principles from this rewrite it
with AI top of mind right so I don't know traction
well enough to riff on that but kind of like there
needs to be um a visionary and an integrator right
isn't that what traction says there two types
of business owners in the world visionary and
integrator maybe the visionary would be the guy
setting up automations in um NAN or Lindy or any
of those software and you could use like specific
tools kind of like Tim Ferrris's book Tools of
Titans right where he he takes all these tools and

[27:00]
he integrates them into like optimizing your life
so it would basically it would not be associated
with EOS in any way but you'd be completely
ripping off what has made EOS successful which is
helping people turn around businesses with success
but putting AI at the forefront of it like how to
implement AI into your business with kind of an
EOS first principles framework and you could do
the same thing you could start with a book you
could sell it for $15 because they you don't
need to reinvent the wheel they're doing great
they're selling franchises they're doing great
and then you do inerson stuff and you literally
fly people there charge $10,000 a day but instead
of like focusing on how to better manage your
people it's like how to replace your people with
apps and loss right unabashedly what do we think
i dig it i think there Yeah AI is going to change
everything in terms of doing business and yeah I
think I dig it i like it i got nothing else to say
to me like I think EOS's value proposition is
"Oh $10,000 for a day but you're going to fix my

[28:02]
$7 million business that's a great value." This
value proposition is "Oh $10,000 for a day but
I'm going to save $30,000 a month on payroll from
now on because you're going to just show me these
tools and automations and frameworks and LLM that
can replace you know Linda at the front desk it
sounds morbid but it's going to happen." like it
linda's getting fired whether we get paid for it
or not so we might as well get paid for it i got
one for you have you ever heard of a show called
Metastasis no okay so Metastasis it's on YouTube
what Metastasis was is some guys in Latin America
some cable systems in Latin America they went to
Sony Pictures and Sony Pictures owns the entirety
of uh the copyright to Breaking Bad arguably a top
five drama ever it's amazing and so what they did
was they went through the entire series and they
did the entire thing as a low-budget film but in

[29:04]
Spanish for Latin America the rights holder
did this so no the guys some guys in Colombia
okay that worked at a cable station went and
licensed the script to redo the entire thing in
native Latin American Spanish and they recreated
Breaking Bad in Spanish in Colia scene by scene
so like holy cow the whole dubbing just starting
from scratch straight up there's a Walter White
except his name is you know Julio Blanco right or
whatever it is i don't know walter is in Spanish
but they went and redid the whole thing as this
particular like thing and it's hugely popular like
it was one of the most popular shows in Colombia
which is a huge economy people don't realize it
colombia yeah one of the biggest economies in
Latin America is it only being shown in Colombia
or all over Latin America i think it's all over
Latin America but they called it Metastasis

[30:02]
because you know the whole show That's the name
of the show that's the name of the show and you
can watch it on YouTube yeah it's on YouTube yeah
there's all kinds of scenes where like you know
a version of Tuco is like snorting the mess have
you seen any of them yeah yeah I watched them yeah
is it like a good production quality like good
actors it's very low quality but they did it scene
by scene but they did it with like a 50th the
budget holy cow pizza on the roof and everything
yeah yeah so the whole thing but if you look at
it this format has actually this idea of taking
something that worked in one place and putting it
someplace else like we see this pattern over and
over again like the office is actually you know
was originally a UK show they just redid it in
the US with a slightly different twist on it and
these guys actually changed a few little things in
metastasis but I think it's this huge opportunity
to go mine content that has worked really well in
other places and just bring it to a new culture
and adapt the whole thing so I think there's

[31:00]
a future for doing this like you go find these
stories that are amazing and then you just redo
them but oh my gosh of course there is like that's
a no-brainer it's Isn't that what Disney was built
on taking like these old fables and modernizing
them well Mr beast did it for the longest time i
think he still does it he has actors in his studio
that for all of his videos basically he has them
in English and then he has like a native Korean
speaker recreating all of them for Mr be's Korea
oh my gosh yeah Jimmy's pretty Jimmy's pretty
smart yeah he is why aren't more people doing that
like that seems like a no-brainer like Seinfeld
Friends what are like every classic yeah well it
is it is interesting have you gone back to watch
like an episode of Cheers or even some of the
stuff older all all in the family and stuff like
that i've watched with my kids like season one
through three of Seinfeld which is like early 90s
right i think as you get older than that though

[32:02]
it's pretty tough for it to translate a lot of the
stuff is is it doesn't match with the times and
the pace of stuff we're looking for like I watched
a Cheers episode the other day and I was like this
is so boring who said how is this must see TV
this is like must sleep TV that's what I was like
wow so the idea is to just do that more other
languages other countries other shows yeah yeah
right yeah go find the most the the stuff and
redo them in Spanish like Spanish is if you have
to pick languages right it's like it's Chinese
English Hindi Spanish like and French like those
are your options if you want to get the get the
and just go do them in do them in Spanish man that
that is actually blowing my mind like I knew that
Mr beast did that but I didn't know that someone
did that with Breaking Bad that's a no-brainer
yeah so I did have uh my Spanish tutor by the
way kept really trying to get me to start doing
business content as a gringo in Spanish he said

[33:04]
it would kill he said it would kill okay so like
just your same type of content but in Spanish with
poor Spanish and it's a gringo exactly that well
and so I don't know if you know about this but in
China there's this huge phenomenon where they love
uh Westerners speaking in Chinese they love it so
there's like all these white white people who
become standup but they're not funny in English
but they're hilarious in Mandarin so they're white
like standup comics and they kill they kill in
China well because it's like uh it's confirmation
bias right they they stand up and they're already
like "Who's this freaking weirdo?" Right and like
they're they're like "Oh Americans are funny."
Like maybe they think that and so they go into
it expecting to laugh and so any dumb thing that
he says makes them laugh it It's kind of like if
you were to like you know Nate Bargatsi I'm sure
he was just as funny when no one knew who he was
right right they weren't expecting him to be funny
he's just this no-name guy in a club but he he's
probably repeating the same jokes that bombed back

[34:05]
then today that everyone just they just crush
because they go into it already loving him and
expecting him to be oh he has a Netflix special
it's gonna be funny it's is confirmation bi yeah
he talks about um a lot of the skat skits that he
did on Saturday Night Live bombed because around
table read because he didn't know how to he didn't
have an audience to play off of he has to he's
learn to listen to the audience for his timing so
the reason he's the guy Nate's the guy that did
the George Washington skit right that's one of the
best of all time um I use that meme all the time
so I should know who the guy but he said that
that skit bombed in the table read at Saturday
Night Live but it killed at the audience because
he could the timing would work with the audience
whereas around the table read people were just
like I don't get it that kid is so good so okay
so let me tell you something else about China this
is pretty crazy so for the longest time having an
a white guy associated with your product in China
was seen as luxury would would make it seem like

[35:04]
it was super classy so there were actually all
these businesses that kind of 10-15 years ago
sprung up basically that were like white guys of
service and they would hire local foreigners to
come to like apartment grand openings to help
them sell apartments or like restaurant grand
opening so there' just be like a random white guy
who didn't speak any Chinese just hanging out like
that made it more sophisticated and people be
like oh this this is classy it's kind of like
we treat an English accent when you meet someone
with an English accent like oh that guy's smart
he speaks he's accent biased so it's like I could
go over there and be Bradley Cooper right now they
would love me yeah yeah it's not hard not hard man
that's another business idea guys I'm available
anybody 5,000 if anyone in China is listening i'm
not too proud pay for my plane ticket i'm there
all right i got another one for you okay well
wait i got a Oh go for it i gota I got to riff

[36:00]
on that one because I've got one excited about my
ideas yeah sorry sorry this will be fast this will
be fast so there is much more demand on Facebook
than supply of video content okay all the creators
are on Instagram everyone's ignoring Facebook
they have 2.1 billion daily active users 2.1
billion with a B daily active users that's crazy
okay facebook is paying creators like me to post
Facebook reels natively to Facebook because they
don't have enough good content that's why you log
into Facebook and it's all slop because there's
just nothing good for them to show people so I
get paid 20 cents per thousand views on my reels
and it's substantial like it has been substantial
my reels go viral there more than anywhere else
but I recently learned because there's this guy
in Canada this Indian guy that's copying all of my
content he take I put out a video six hours later
he verbatim repeats my transcript on my reels
in his own voice in Hindi and then publishes it

[37:01]
it's the he doesn't change a word and he's doing
very well he has 400,000 followers on Instagram
and he's only copying me okay in Hindi in Hindi
so then I look into it and I said all right how
many daily active users on Facebook in the US
220 million or something what about in India
it's twice that it's like 400 million okay so
twice as big of a market clearly much much less
valuable like less GDP per capita right but what I
started doing is I created the kerner office Hindi
on Facebook Instagram everywhere and I get ahead
of it now i use 11 Labs and I publish as soon as I
publish this video about this idea I publish the
same thing in Hindi i cloned my voice it sounds
like me it is me it's my face so I can get ahead
of it he's still going to copy me but it will have
much less effect in a few months I I hope to have
thousands of Facebook followers and I hope to be
monetized on that account as well so here's the
idea you do that as a service for any creator
that's on any platform specifically on like
Instagram and Facebook and you take a revshare

[38:04]
you just use 11 Labs you clone their voice with
their own content you download their videos you
do it in a permissionless way then you reach
out for permission and you take 20 30 40% of
the revenue they get from these platforms for
publishing it in Hindi what do we think i think
that's great back in the day we used to call that
internationalization and the shortcut for it is
I8N because there's 18 letters between I and N
it's like A16Z yeah i was already trying to name
it for you which was like internationalization
as a service yeah so basically what Jimmy Mr
beast is doing with his stuff but you just go to
creators who have stuff and look I really like
this one i think it's one of our best ideas so
far because the reason I like it is it it matches
this type of model that works really well which
is I call it found money where it's basically
like hey like this is revenue you weren't going
to get it's not going to cost you anything i'll
take care of everything and I'll give you half
of whatever I Yeah get for you right so Molson

[39:03]
Hart you know Twitter friend maybe if of mine he's
not everybody's Twitter friend i'm not everybody's
Twitter friend either but he had a business for
example that would go sue people who had violated
patents and then split the revenue for them so
kind of found money i like this this is actually
better than my ideas no no no no but it it's made
it's made more capable thanks to 11 Labs and like
AI voice cloning whereas Jimmy has had to like
literally hire actors and dub these videos but
this is more scalable now yeah well the reason
he did actors is he said he couldn't get the
translation stuff to do the right inonation just
didn't feel good and the dude's got a lot of money
so I mean he just paid Yeah a guy $250,000 to
tweet about his business so he's got a lot was
that real i don't know it felt really funny that's
for sure it was really funny yeah okay this one
is an idea that I think is time has come uh you
live in Dallas i live in San Antonio mosquitoes
are a problem do you have mosquitoes in your
yard oh yeah they're horrible how much money

[40:02]
would you pay to get rid of the mosquitoes in your
backyard oh I don't know people would pay tens of
thousands of dollars like here in San Antonio and
in most places in the south we have these Asian
tiger mosquitoes that are these invasive species
from Southeast Asia they fly in any weather they
don't care they're mean as hell and they will just
come in and inje take your blood and you're left
with a sore that lasts for days it's not like
the mosquitoes you have up north because they
just survive everything as long as there's no deep
freeze they're cool they are vicious so back in
the day like 15 years ago um Nathan Mirvold
who was the CTO of uh of Microsoft he left
Microsoft took his billion dollars and went and
started a business that would buy up intellectual
property and create intellectual property so one
of the patents they created was this device that
basically would watch the sky for mosquitoes to
start flying and then it used lasers to shoot them
down it burned their wings off i'm not joking
so there is a TED talk video of him 15 years

[41:04]
ago demonstrating them doing Star Wars Death Star
against mosquitoes and back then it was hard like
you couldn't figure out so so the problem back
then was you have a laser that is strong enough
to kill a mosquito from 30 feet away there's
a problem that is also strong enough to blind
people and so you kind of have a problem there so
it wasn't really going to be practical given the
computing at the time to have something smart
enough not to blind people but we're there now
like you look at what's happening with the AI
stuff and the ability to process like a normal
like you know for 40 series like Nvidia GPU
can run a model good enough to only shoot down
mosquitoes so somebody needs to build the mosquito
death star that like sits in my backyard and just
blast mosquitoes out of the sky that would go
viral so easily are you kidding me one Instagram
reel and you've sold thousands of units yeah so
there's some challenges here but I'll leave it

[42:04]
there which is mosquito death star that is so
cool there's a video of this where you can see
it at work it's TED talk yeah I'll put it I'll
put it in our little thing here oh my gosh that
is so cool it's like the fly zapper for the new
age right yeah but we call it the mosquito death
star how Who is now buying the mosquito death star
oh oh take my money that is so cool so you just Is
that what you're launching is is that the business
you're dude no i totally want to build it though
can you buy these like can you import these no
they haven't ever commercialized it okay yeah
that's the it's the big problem if you look up
mosquito TED talk it just shows you Bill Gates
releasing mosquitoes into the audience oh here it
is it's from 2010 could this mosquito zap malaria
it's Nathan Mirvolt so I'll put it here in the
little thing oh man somebody should build this i
will buy one yeah I would buy one i'd pay a couple
thousand bucks for that oh my god like it's a

[43:03]
party trick if nothing else it's like a lava lamp
it's cool oh and it'd be so cool like you could
also you could sell like a version where inside
your house is like a little scoreboard and it's
like ding like every time it blasts a mosquito out
of the sky oh yeah gify it so sick so sick or like
phone notifications you just zapped a mosquito you
just like Black Mirror okay i'm gonna riff on that
one too you ready hit me so I saw a similar video
a year or two ago of a laser in China that cuts
down trees it's a very very powerful laser and
they like if a branch is like hanging into a power
line it can go and it will burn off like there's
a a thickness maximum to it right you're not going
to do like a huge tree like this technology exists
they're using it in this purpose in Asia today
so I'm going to take what you just said about
AI the big problem with this today is it could
kill people it would kill kill people right it's
a weapon but if you had like a simple optical lens

[44:07]
on it or a sensor that could say "All right you're
only going to fire if you're pointed northward at
the sky if I see a tree if I can ident like
you could even go so far as like if I can
identify what kind of tree it is right which any
iPhone could do and if the thickness of the tree
is only so much and there's no humans in the area
then I will cut off this branch cuz I own a tree
trimming business like it's We just did a job last
week $3,000 job it took us like three hours and we
just had a a bucket truck 60 foot bucket truck
it's a big pain it's a lot of friction so if you
could just roll up and go "All right peace out."
It would bring the cost down i like that you could
sell the equipment to tree trimmers you could
start a tree trimming business you could service
the equipment you could import license whatever
sick lasers i like that one tree cutting laser

[45:01]
yeah that's good okay okay okay let me put you
on this one this is crazier than mosquito death
star so are you familiar with how Texas counties
work and how they get revenue no okay so you live
in Okay so Colin County will have five or seven
county commissioners one of whom is the county
judge so the county judge is not really a judge
they're like the mayor of the county and in the
state of Texas they have the ability to do stuff
not as much as being a city which live on top of
the counties but they have the power to do some
stuff like they can collect taxes they collect
property taxes sales taxes that sort of stuff and
then they use that to fund services like sheriff
and water and building permits and stuff like that
okay and so the county commissioners will vote on
ordinances and pass that kind of stuff and they
will collect salaries as well out in West Texas
there is one of 254 counties in the state of Texas
and it is actually the least populated county
in the entire United States it has 24 full-time
residences residents holy cow the name of the town

[46:06]
is called Menon and it is west of the thriving
metropolis of Kermit Texas which you've also not
heard and it's about 2 140 miles west of Midland
Odessa this county has 24 Loving County loving
County okay i just asked Chad GBT yeah Loving
County is the name of county so 24 residents the
county itself um has 24 residents they mostly
live in this little city of Menon which until
recently didn't have running water um they do have
one of the nicest rec centers you'll ever see in
a state or in a county it's random the whole
town of Venon is about 12 score blocks okay the
rest of the county is oil fields oil field after
oil field after oil field so valuable property
generating a lot of revenue and because there are
no residents and because there are property taxes
being collected on these properties and these
oil wells the county last year uh ran a $40 plus

[47:05]
million annual surplus this year it's going to run
a $56 million annual surplus by projection they
have $200 million in the bank for 24 residents so
they're basically like they've got all this money
nobody living there and nothing to do with it so
the interesting thing is how much how many people
do you need to have on the county commissioner's
court in order to pass ordinances say ordinances
like giving a tax refund to all the residents or
using some of that fund to hire the residences at
very high amounts right or doing what Alaska does
and give everybody monthly checks well it turns
out uh you only need to have three out of the five
and the elections are coming up so basically in
the state of Texas in order to maintain residency
in a particular county it's a pretty low bar you
just need to be there long enough ahead of time
to get yourself registered as a voter and then
you could basically like go vote so with 24
residences residents there Chris all you need

[48:05]
to do is go find about 20 of your friends willing
to put residency out in the town of Menon and then
elect yourself control of the local government
and then Is it really that straightforward i mean
yeah the elections are pretty small there's no
way to like prevent that no not it's an election
holy cow so like what would be the name of the
position that you would try to like run for you'd
want to be the county judge and two of the county
commissioners okay you have three out of five you
have majority judge jury executioner yeah well
okay so that leads into why this is a bad idea you
could imagine so let me finish the upside so the
upside is you go and be like "Hey we're passing an
ordinance we're declaring a dividend we're going
to give $100 million out to all residences at as
of this date." And everybody walks home with their
share of $100 million right and you still have

[49:00]
$100 million left over as a county and you're
going to make more money the next year all for
going to spend six months in bento so that's the
upside that's the upside of this whole thing and
uh go from there here's the downside if you go
Google this town and you go Google the county
commissioner you will see that he is a convicted
cattle rustler in other words he's been convicted
of stealing in other words he will kill you so
so so it's kind of like the I call it the Key
West effect you ever notice how Key West is just
full of bunch of weirdos like people who go just
there's people who just keep traveling a certain
direction until they can't go any further and
they end up in they just stop they end up in Santa
Monica or they end up in Key West or Venice Beach
and Key West right same thing going on here
there's a reason these Yeah there's there's
a reason these people live here like they're
either running away from something or they
want to be some someplace where nobody's going to
bother them so you know before doing this I think
number one you have to worry about personal safety
number two like you just get pillared in the press

[50:04]
like there's no way you're not getting in the New
York Times and just totally hated for the rest of
your life for doing this so it's not really worth
either the the threat of physical harm or the the
reputational damage but it is a fun intellectual
exercise this is an incredibly fun intellectual
exercise like what are they going to do with the
money if nothing ever happens do they distribute
the interest dividends like I don't know i mean go
look at their civic center they have like tennis
courts they have more tennis courts than they have
residents so I don't know what they're doing with
all the money you need to live there for 24 or
sorry 6 months to be eligible to vote no it's
less than that you just got to go through a voter
registration cycle establishing residency Texas
County to establish residence in a Texas county
individuals typically needed to demonstrate they
have a permanent residence a Texas driver's
license or state ID and a register to vote in
that county you just need a permanent address
that's your primary residence there so you go

[51:00]
buy a building give everybody an apartment spend
a certain number of days there and make that your
primary residence jeez okay if I were going to
pull this off I would get enough friends to ensure
a majority okay i don't need any locals to vote
for me i'm only going to have my friends vote for
me okay i'm going to pay them i'm going to write
them an IOU and say "Hey after the election I'm
going to give you $5 million or whatever it is a
million dollars and then I'm going to move there
quietly." Like you can't move there quietly right
and I'll I'll be an official resident and I won't
say a word i won't say a peep until like a week
before the election then I bring in my security
force right like a professionally trained security
force and then I just go live with the news hey
I'm running for judge now you you got to file by
a certain date I'm sure correct but even if you
file like way in advance you don't have to say
what your platform is you don't say a peep no
yard signs nothing week before the election by the
way here's what I'm doing there's no way you don't
win that election but like why are you even such a
bad guy like I'm going to put this much to charity

[52:04]
i'm going to leave this much in the bank account
i'm going to give this much to all the residents
you know what I'm saying like yeah yeah yeah call
me I'll participate I'm not moving to loving Texas
but this is a very interesting thought experiment
yeah it's just really fun when you think about you
can also it is not that difficult to create
your own city in the state of Texas have you
ever heard about this I think I've seen you talk
about it maybe yeah it's really pretty easy so
used to be there's a city called mobile city out
on the northeast side in Rockwell County used to
be the only place that there was a liquor store
for like 30 miles because it was a dry county
dry counties are pretty much not a thing anymore
you can sell alcohol anywhere but back in the day
counties didn't often have alcohol sales there's
actually a city in Oklahoma called Fireworks City
guess what they sell there do you have a location
there no we're just in Texas you're pushed out

[53:01]
man let me see okay I got one more and then I
think we're gonna run time okay let's do it okay
so I think there is uh we're at the early stage of
a movement of being very pro-natalism like people
want to see more bursts and you're seeing a lot
of very rich wealthy people realizing Elon Musk is
one of them that the future of this country needs
more people having kids you and I are speaking in
the choir you have four i have two but there are
tons of technologies it's I think it's going to
be a technological solution to fix the natal the
birth rate problem in this country if you don't
if you're not following it here in the US our
birth rate has dipped below replacement which
is 2.1 births per woman and the birth rate is
down 17% in the past 15 years the average woman
is having 17% fewer kids than before which like
I've watched it as an adult like businesses that
are dependent upon kids being prevalent and
common like I'm seeing fewer and fewer young
people and everybody looks older like there's
just more boomers and the societyy's getting

[54:01]
older so people are seeing what can happen like in
a Japan or a Korea when you're not having enough
kids like I think there is a business to be run
here to go out and raise a VC fund specifically
to invest in pro-natalist technologies so the
business model is straightforward same as any
VC fund you get carry and you get fees and you're
just saying we're going to invest in things that
are going to make money in a pro-natalist manner
like we're people we're going to do things that
encourage people to have more kids so that's
things like humanoid robots potentially like
incubation strategies for kids like there's
lots of people that are already doing it like
rich people are already paying other people to
have their kids like there will be a future in
which we're able to laboratory wise have kids
incubated outside of a woman's body now you can
argue whether that's cool or not like those
are tech the technologies between that and
making education cheaper and like health care
or and child care like making that cheaper all
these technologies will make a huge deal so I
think the the core business I think is somebody
could go raise $100 million fund to invest in
startups in this vein very easily and at 2 and

[55:04]
20 that's a $2 million a year pastry oh I love
it what would be the example of like a an embryo
robot something like that the reason women aren't
having as many kids right now if you go interview
them and like do studies on them the reason they
will say they're not doing it is because generally
they want to be focusing on career they want to
be achieving things like they don't want having
a kid to sideline all that kind of stuff it stops
them from doing the things they want to pursue in
life whether that's work or hobbies and that sort
of thing so basically what you have to do is you
have to go and figure out technologies that are
going to make it so having a kid is not so costly
from opportunity cost monetarily as well so it's
every technology that kind of feeds into that so
how does finding a partner get easier right and
cheaper right a lot of women are not reproducing
because they can't find a good partner um how does
like conceiving get cheaper and easier how does
like carrying a baby to term right and birthing
a baby get cheaper and easier how does child care

[56:03]
get easier how does tutoring get easier how does
schooling get easier how does all that stuff how
does and then how does college get cheaper like
any technology that's going to feed into making
that less of an opportunity cost and less costly
for women is I think and for men is like fair game
oh I love it someone's going to do that like there
are VC funds around all types of big macro trends
like this i haven't seen one for this but it's
gonna happen no I think it's totally I mean if
you look there's ones around like the carbon you
know the green revolution like all that stuff is
totally there in general like I like the idea of
investing in investing in what you want the world
to become the hard part is nailing the timing
because I do think it's going to turn around i
think the pendulum will swing especially when we
have robots in our homes cooking and cleaning for
us then there'll be less pressure for moms to do
that i love it yeah well and it's I mean a lot of
the reason the birth rate is down is you also
look at the societal pressures that parenting
require has forced parenting to become if you
look at the amount of time dads and moms were

[57:05]
spending on parenting activities over the past 50
years they're more than doubled in terms of the
number of hours per week like we've just had this
massive inflation of expectations of what we're
expecting good parenting to look like and it's
just kind of crazy that this is people look at
that and you I don't know did you see the Chapel
Ran interview yes yes it's just so depressing it
was just crap it's so depressing where she's like
"All my friends who have kids are miserable."
And I'm like "Well it doesn't have to be that
way you're just doing it wrong." I think she's
misinterpreting what she's seeing you know like
yeah changing diapers waking up in the middle of
the night is not fun but that's not that's like
1% of parenting in the grand scheme of things
oh man that was good my brain is fried all right
well I do have more for next time there will be
a next time are we going to vote for a winner
here oh yeah we should vote for a winner well
what's Let's pick our top three finalists look I
want to do your internationalization as a service

[58:05]
found money one i vote for that one for number one
or for a final it's in our top top three or four
okay okay i'm going to vote for the your browser
plugin like I think that's number one for a reason
i love that idea and I think any vibe coder could
build that in a weekend so we got browser plugin
internationalization as a service i would like to
nominate number three as the local government LBO
just because it's so crazy it's cattle has cattle
rustlers in it dude yeah yeah so are those the
three finalists then I also like Mosquito Death
Star because I want to buy it i know i know we
have Oldtimey Photo Booth Small Business Minority
Buyous EOS Implement Pro Oldtimey Photo Booths
going for Old Time Photo Booth okay it's like it
drives me crazy when you see something like that

[59:00]
in a bar that's clearly successful that doesn't
require an operator or an employee why isn't that
in every bar there's no Give me a good reason
i don't have one all right so take 10 seconds
and we'll each nominate our number one and then
we'll decide which one's the winner all right
all right i'll go first internationalization
as a service is my winner i think it's the
best idea okay all right specifically like using
11 Labs to all that or Yeah i think that you go
create an agency you go to all these folks who
are generating content in one language and say
"Hey I'm going to produce all this and republish
it for you in a foreign language and I'm gonna
spit the revenue for you with you 5050." Yeah
you need a $50 a month 11 Labs account and the
ability to DM people and you're in business and
then you go hire a bunch of offshore folks and
you just run a playbook on all of it and create
parallel accounts for it i love it i'm gonna go
with oldtimey photo booths oldtime Photo Booth
because that's very approachable to me with

[1:00:00]
the browser plugin you're going to have a hard
time finding customers because it's just another
plugin oldtime Photo Booths you just freaking
get get a bar owner on the phone and you go
buy them from China or wherever and you place it
that's it all right well those two are tied for
first I would say yeah yeah tied for everybody
wins in this podcast yeah but the other the one
that you chose is also very approachable for
anyone yeah and that's a big reason why I like
it as well it's super good where can everyone
