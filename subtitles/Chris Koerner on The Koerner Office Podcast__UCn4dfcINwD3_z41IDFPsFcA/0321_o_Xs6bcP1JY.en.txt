[00:00]
welcome to the ker office it's Friday
which means that Nick and my business
partner and I are meeting for hold cob
Bros and if you're new to the Pod holdco
Bros is where we discuss business ideas
and what's going on in our companies and
really cool things we saw on the
internet that you might be able to learn
from so today we talk about Instagram's
close friends feature where there is a
way to add all of your friends to close
friends so when you post a story it gets
not just shown to everyone but prior
itiz to everyone so there is a business
where you can help influencers there are
millions of them add all of their tens
of thousands or hundreds of thousands or
millions of friends to close friends so
they can get a ton more engagement which
makes them a lot more money which can
help make you money we talk about
negative cogs we've talked about this
before but this is a different angle as
in acquiring products for free or
getting paid to acquire products and
then selling them you talk about the
lake weed removal business that I just
posted about last week and how why

[01:01]
posted about last week and how why
that's such a cool idea then we talked
about some more home service business
ideas and we were just all over the map
we were online business ideas offline
business ideas but you're going to love
it please share with a friend and we'll
see you next
[Music]
time this isn't a billion- dollar idea
but this is something that someone could
start this afternoon okay you ready
okay on
Instagram they have a a feature called
close friends are you familiar with that
I think so actually but yeah go ahead so
normally when you post a story it is for
the world to see but if you add your
close friends to the close friends
folder so to speak then when you post a
story it will only show to them okay and
when you do post a a story into close
friends it prioritizes it Instagram puts
it in the beginning of your friends
stories and they can see that they're in
your close friends right so they feel a
little special and they they'll see it

[02:01]
little special and they they'll see it
so what that means is the views on your
story go way way up okay okay now it was
like Ranna or Kim Kardashian or someone
right after this feature came out they
somehow added all of their millions and
millions of followers to close friends
somehow like on an accident no no like
they paid someone to do it and their
engagement went crazy and there are a
few people anecdotally here and there
that do it and I've read message boards
I've gone deep I've looked at forums and
your engagement Goes Up 3 to 6X on your
stories okay so here's what that means
so when I post a story with a call to
action let's say like our school scrape
right we talked about we scraped Alex
hor Mo's list of the top 10,000 School
groups Skol and I posted a story to
Instagram and I said hey I scraped this
give it away for free subscribe to my
newsletter to get it and I got like
23,000 View views on that story which is

[03:01]
23,000 View views on that story which is
about 10% of my total followers and I
got like, 1500 2,000 email subscribers
which is great it's a ton but if I would
have been able to add all of those
Instagram subscribers to close friends
theoretically it could have been 3 to
Sixx that amount both the views and the
subscribers okay okay so I went up work
and I found people that can do this
there's not a lot it's really really
hard to find someone that can do this
this there's some custom code involved
but it is possible I mean people have
done it so of course it's possible to do
this so my idea is to reach out to
people that have 10 50 100,000 500,000
million followers and offer to do this
for them for a flat fee because what I
was being charged to do this I haven't
done it yet but I will is like 3040 $50
to build this out for me once so build
it once sell it a thousand times you

[04:00]
it once sell it a thousand times you
could charge hundred 500 a thousand
dollars because for all the people out
there there are many many people out
there that are monetizing their business
on Instagram you're giving them 3 to
Sixx more engagement flat one time fee I
get that this would be business for you
because like you're already doing it but
like how how would somebody listening to
this say oh I could do that business
because they will offer this as a
service to people on Instagram that
could make a lot more money if they had
all of their followers in CL close
friends okay so it's just two Instagram
influencers essentially that are selling
a product like that's the target demo
which there are millions of like way
more than I ever thought right I'm just
saying they wouldn't be going to like
the business down the street no and
offering to do this for them on
Instagram they'd be going to someone
who's an influencer that sells a product
yeah I mean they could go to the
restaurant that has 30,000 followers
that post you know appetizer discounts
in their story theoretically anyone with
a business or a personal brand that
monetizes is that somehow on Instagram

[05:01]
monetizes is that somehow on Instagram
could be a customer of this the Creator
economy is just so
interesting because there are so many
ways to monetize it that have not yet
been
exploited 30 years ago before we had
social media how were products conveyed
to people they were either in print in a
newspaper they were either in a magazine
they were in radio or they were in
television those are like pretty much
the channels some type of print media
radio
television and a few companies that had
the distribution really
controlled what got out there not just
the pricing of it but also the supply of
what was able to be marketed and now
you've got people who have built micro
businesses they're making a couple
hundred thousand dollars a year and
they've got an audience that can sell
products to people so it's like opened
up this world of advertising that just

[06:00]
up this world of advertising that just
didn't exist before and people are still
trying to figure out the best way to do
it and this is an example of that or
it's like oh Instagram just introduced
close friends hm I wonder if I could
build a business off of this that would
improve our advertising metrics and it
turns out you can because if people are
close friends you're going to improve
the rate at which people subscribe to
your newsletter or see the product or
purchase the product Etc it's not really
an idea here I'm just it's crazy to me
that every week there's like a new idea
for how to better leverage these
platforms for
distribution I've got another one for
you oh okay so kind of along the same
vein I don't know who follows me on
Instagram right I can click on my
followers and swipe and I can see them
but there's 230,000 of them I don't know
who they are is there anyone cool or
important that follows me I don't know
I'd like to maybe we could do a
collaboration somehow so I I paid a
virtual assistant on upwork

[07:00]
virtual assistant on upwork
$100 and they scraped all of my
followers into a spreadsheet and this
was actually very hard to do because I
never found some if someone finds this
please let me know I never found a third
party app that will do this for you
because of Instagram's API limitations I
found one Chrome extension that will do
it but they throttle you and they'll cut
you off after like one or 2,000 scraped
and youve got
230,000 yeah I found a guy he charged
100 bucks it took him 2 days and he got
every single one of my followers in a
spreadsheet now here's why that's
valuable Nick because about 10% of my
followers list their phone number and or
their email address in their profile so
really I've got 20,000 emails now that I
could email I'm not going to add them to
my newsletter because they haven't opted
in but I could send them a cold email
and say hey I I don't know if you know
who I am but you follow me on Instagram
I know this is random but I send out a
free business idea every week would you
like to opt into my newslet letter right

[08:00]
like to opt into my newslet letter right
so let's say I convert 10 to 20% of
those and boom with a few clicks I get
two or three thousand more um email
subscribers so that's cool or I could go
to all the people that have over 100,000
followers and say hey let's do a
collaboration somehow like you're in
business I'm in business we're both on
Instagram maybe there's some way we
could work together so my whole thesis
is it is really valuable for people that
are on Instagram as a business owner to
know who follows them because it's not
who you know it's who knows you so if
you are reaching out to influencers with
this pitch about adding people to close
friends this is another pitch it's just
hey do you mind if I send you a
spreadsheet of all of your followers
it's just a spreadsheet it's not a
spreadsheet with like analysis because
how would you identify who the who the
Val they have Google sheet uh extensions
where you can integrate open aai into
your Google sheet into a a new cell and
you can say hey this is what I do I sell
cookies to wedding planners I want you

[09:00]
cookies to wedding planners I want you
to tell me if any of my followers are
interesting or could collaborate with me
somehow so you could send it to them
like with that already done because most
people won't have ideas they won't know
what to do with them so part of the
pitch has to be implanting an idea in
them and is the scraping just the 10%
that have the phone number and email or
is it everyone is it's everybody so it's
their first name last name username URL
if they follow you or not if their
profiles verified or not phone number
email address
location if it's listed website if it's
listed so you could say hey for 300
bucks I'm going to add all your
followers to close friends for 500 bucks
I'm going to do that and send you a
scrape of all of your followers and then
you pay you just Outsource all of it I
wonder if you could also do that like
let's say there's somebody who's trying
to grow a business and and and they have
a business that
sells I don't know healthy water no
that's a stupid one healthy protein
shakes healthy protein shakes however
you define healthy protein

[10:01]
you define healthy protein
shakes and you want to qualify which
influencer you think is going to be the
best for your
brand could you do some analysis of
their followers or this could be for the
influencer right like if you're a
podcaster like we are and somebody wants
to come and Buy ad time they're going to
ask you for your download information
right they want to know how many people
are actually downloading and listening
to your episodes so this could be
something where that you provide it for
Instagram influencers to say like this
will give you the profile of your
followers that you can then give give to
people who are asking you for
information about marketing with you
like a Media Kit yeah it's like a Media
Kit but it's like an audience profile
kit yeah that would be interesting or
you it could automatically make a Media
Kit for you based on everything it
learns from your follower base like all
right you can charge this much per real
this is the average age of your follower
and all that yeah I like that there's
like applications that I you can't even
think of all the
applications that was a really stupid
thing to say I'm so dumb you can't even
like think of all the ideas there's so

[11:00]
like think of all the ideas there's so
many of the ideas I sound like KLA
Harris dude yesterday was today
yesterday and tomorrow will be today
yesterday's
tomorrow I got one for you you ready
yeah I got this text this week hey Nick
I'm a Dallas I'm Dallas based too people
always think I'm dallas-based which is
funny makes sense anyways I work in the
pallet recycling and waste
industry I was listening to your podcast
and we think the same way about B I'd
love to buy you lunch sometime so I was
like ah what I'm not in Dallas I can't
buy you lunch I was like but what are
you thinking it's like well one of my
customers throws away thousands of tons
of good but not possible to sell
vegetables it's all going to the
landfill so I was like what do you mean
he's like well they tried to sell them
but nobody can take them all so they
just have all this excess inventory of
vegetables and so I was like what made
you reach out he like well the way that
they dispose of the these is they've got
to put them on pallets and then ship

[12:02]
to put them on pallets and then ship
them out right I want you to guess this
guy's their vendor he does their
pallets how much does this company spend
on
pallets a
month well I was in this business a
little bit with send eats because we
used to have to buy pallets and that's
the whole industry pallet recycling
pallet repair New pallet construction
sales oh jeez I don't I don't know I
have no idea but I know they're like5 to
$30 a piece depending on the quality
this company apparently spends
$30,000 a week in
pallets it's crazy $30,000 a week so
$120,000 a month and it got me thinking
about the reason he reached out was
because of the episode where we were
talking about negative cogs where it's
like hey you know you're obsessed with a
business that could be negative cogs so
I wanted to bring this up what kind of a
business could we do with thousands of
pounds a month of vegetables that
they're literally just throwing away
into the landfill it's easy EOS scraps I

[13:01]
into the landfill it's easy EOS scraps I
tweeted about this a month or two ago
those guys in Provo that started EOS
scraps they took they got paid by
grocery stores to take produce that was
old and then they took it to a warehouse
and they mixed in some sawdust and they
mixed it all up they put it in a
shredder and they let it sit for three
months turned into organic compost they
bagged it up sold it to Home Depot for
$5 a bag the major billion dollar
company bought them out like 10 years
ago what really yeah what's the name of
them so like I know it's it's kind of
negative cogs but you'd still need to
pay for the shipping out right basically
their pitch was they went to a grocery
store and said hey how much do you spend
on your trash disposal $2,000 a month
okay can we do it for, 1500 done so they
were still profitable on the
transportation but they got paid to take
this stuff for free they got paid to
take the stuff for freaking free that's
yeah well and this supposedly is
thousands of pound should we do it

[14:00]
thousands of pound should we do it
should I reach out should I reach out to
him is he in Dallas he's in Dallas
yeah I don't want to get his name he
hasn't given me permission so I don't
know what else you could use that for if
there's a listener who's in Dallas that
thinks that they could capitalize on
this reach out to us there was another
business that went around to like all
the cold press juice shops and took so
when you juice a freaking carrot right
you've got all the juice and you've got
all the pulp and they just throw that
pulp away so there's another company
that would just take all the pulp for
free and make like fertilizer out of it
the hard part with both of these is
you've got to like shred it up in like
this huge industrial food Shredder I
almost started this business in
Tuscaloosa those things are a lot of
money because if you don't shred it up
it's going to sit it has to sit for
three years instead of three months what
so you need a truck you need a warehouse
you need a food Shredder and then you
need to buy sawdust and mix it in
chemlon kemlon that was the company that
bought out EOS scraps cool kemlon True

[15:01]
bought out EOS scraps cool kemlon True
Green True Green yeah true green by
kemlon vice versa well I thought you'd
like that story because it was somebody
reach out to me about the negative cogs
business that is a good story all right

You'll see the link and we'll see you
there so I'm on Instagram okay you with
me okay yeah I'm here hey hey Nick I'm
up here
okay
sorry I find these guys on Instagram
19-year-old college students from
Chicago one is a student at University
of Nebraska one is a student University
of Missouri and they grew up together
they were best friends in high school
and they went home for the summer

[16:00]
and they went home for the summer
Chicago suburbs and here's what they did
you ready you with me I'm here I'm here
one of their neighbors they live near or
on a lake and one of their neighbors
says hey guys you home for the summer
yeah I'm installing a dock in my Lake
can you help me do that I'll give you 25
bucks an hour sure so they help him
install a dock and then the other
neighbor is like hey can you install my
Dock and they're like yeah sure and then
another neighbor sees them and they ask
something different they say hey what do
you do about all these weeds that keep
floating up towards the dock CU it's
really gross my grandkids want to swim
off the dock but it's just algae and
seaweed everywhere what do you do with
that and they're just like Hustlers just
trying to make money like H we could try
to clean it I I don't know I don't know
what anyone does here and so they get
these rakes like literally a leaf rake
and they stand in the water ways deep
and they just rake up this seaweed
because it's stuck the floor of the lake
yeah and it's like very hard work just I
mean this seaweed is water lck and
they're lifting it onto the dock they're

[17:00]
they're lifting it onto the dock they're
lifting it onto the backyard takes them
hours and they charge like 500 bucks and
they're like huh and it's such a visual
thing Nick like you were just talking
about it is all the Neighbors come out
and they're like hey can you do mine can
you do mine they keep raising their
prices no one says no 500 bucks for a
morning worth of work s 700 bucks for a
morning worth of work now this is hard
work like there there's no chemicals
there's no automation there's no
machines they literally have rakes and
they hands and they're standing in this
water for hours at a time but they're
making really good money so they do this
a year or two ago then they come back
home and they're like no more dock
installation let's only clean ponds and
lakes and there are companies that do
this but they all spray chemicals and it
doesn't get rid of the actual weeds it
just kills them and so the lake is still
ugly the weeds just don't spread as much
and so literally the only way to do this
without chemicals is the hard way so
then oh this is such a good what raking

[18:00]
then oh this is such a good what raking
that's the hard way yes so then they
start posting videos on Instagram and
Tik Tok and they get 10 20 30,000
subscribers and it's very
visual they put a camera up and some of
their videos hit a million or two
million views and this guy in Chicago
worth tens or hundreds of millions of
dollars that owns this massive Boomer
like a forklift business or something
but with like Nationwide presence he
sees them on Tik Tok this 63y old and
he's like I like you guys remind me of
me when I was
young I want to help you out and they're
like okay he's like have you ever seen
this he sends him a link to like this
boat that does what they're doing it
helps clean out weeds from lakes and
they're like I didn't know this exist
exists it's a $100,000 boat and these
guys are broke college students and he
says let me tell you what how about I
buy this boat and I'll insure it and
I'll rent it out to you and they're like
yes please so he puts 100 Grand down
pays cash for it rents it out to them

[19:00]
pays cash for it rents it out to them
for very very fair rate and now they
have a boat now they're posting videos
of them on their boat cleaning weeds and
they're a lot more efficient they have
more business than they can handle and
dang I followed them on Instagram and
they saw that I followed them and then
they dm' me like oh my gosh thanks for
following me bro and I was like thank
you for dming me you guys are awesome
you want to talk you g get on hear me
out I'm like you want to talk and you
know coming from me to like want to hop
on a call oh yeah that doesn't happen
that doesn't happen so we talked
yesterday okay and I heard the you know
15 minutes of their story and I'm like
you're coming on the pot and like this
is an amazing business because no one's
doing it and it reminds me of the quote
from like- 1800 got junk and he said as
long as pianos weigh 800 lbs there's
always going to be a business for
starting a moving business that's always
going to be around right because pianos
are heavy and it sucks and it's a crappy
business so we'll always stay in
business basically as long as pianos are
800 pounds so it's like this is like the

[20:00]
800 pounds so it's like this is like the
sweatiest ugliest most manual startup in
the world which means it's an amazing
opportunity for anyone and will be for
quite some time what do we think dude
that's awesome I love it awesome it's
somewhat seasonal depending on where you
live and it's somewhat geographical
depending on what type of seaweed grows
in these ponds and lakes but they said
it pretty much Works anywhere in some
places just better than others I'm like
guys you need to like franchise like you
already have a social media presence
like could use that to sell franchises
like put all your Sops in a Google drive
it doesn't need to be franchised it
could be licensing or whatever or sell a
course or whatever but I just I think
these guys are freaking awesome that's
right I love it all right you ready yes
I want to go through with you we talked
about a similar idea to this a couple of
months ago but the top
10 media
accelerated Home Services businesses are
you ready mhm all right the thes that we
had a couple of months ago was that you

[21:03]
had a couple of months ago was that you
could use YouTube Instagram Facebook
whatever to make videos that people
would then click into to promote your
services now we were talking about it
from like an influencer standpoint
because this one guy he goes around he
cleans up people's yards that are just a
total mess and he's subscribed he's
gotten millions of subscribers he makes
a lot of money because it's really cool
to see that time lapse but then we
started talking about like what are some
other Industries or businesses that you
could do this with well I started
thinking about
if you were the side hustle type and you
wanted to start a business and you
didn't have money for marketing and you
didn't really know what else to do what
are the top 10 Home Services businesses
that would work really really well on
Instagram YouTube Facebook by posting
time-lapse videos of your projects so
that's the thesis here okay okay num Uno
pressure
washing like dude I don't know if you
resonate with this I I think every man
will I could watch a 30 minute video of

[22:03]
will I could watch a 30 minute video of
somebody pressure washing either like a
really dirty surface a carpet you dude
have you ever seen the carpet pressure
washing vide the rug on dude the rugs oh
my gosh it's amazing and they and like
we all do the same thing we're like okay
now I'm going to do a square and I'm
going to clean inside the square like
it's actually super embarrassing Jesse
caught me in the middle of the night
watching one of those I just really I'm
just
kidding we're struggling through it
it's like eight years ago when I went to
go visit Chris yes and I was staying at
his house never forget this I was
downstairs on the couch I had my laptop
up and open and I was watching a movie
keep this ined and Chris Chris was like
coming down the stairs and he's like oh
my gosh it's midnight Nick's watching
something what if I could see like the
glow around the corner and I'm like I
thought he was asleep and I'm like oh
this guy I'm about to okay what's he
looking's like what what if he's
watching porn oh my Chris turns the corn
and there I am

[23:01]
and there I am
32-year-old father of a few children and
I was watching the Ice Age on Netflix
and laugh my head off yeah in the middle
of the night in my living roomies what
can I say all right so pressure washing
I think I think is number one you ready
for number two this one surprised me but
I went and looked pool cleaning mhm dude
those videos and there there is like a
combination of pool cleaning and
pressure washing if you've ever seen
someone PR wash a drained pool mhm
forget about it that's a banger forget
about it it's amazing mhm number three
this is something I've been seeing a lot
more recently home
cleaning where like I saw this one video
of this like guy in China who had an
apartment and this guy like smoked three
packs a day for years and the walls were
just caked like brown and he went and
cleaned it and then it was like before
and after and the after's like the
apartment's clean now and I'm like dude
I would never want to live in that
apartment but anyways
yeah I've never I've never seen like a

[24:00]
yeah I've never I've never seen like a
time lapse of a someone cleaning a
hoarder house like a video up in the
corner of the room I've never seen one
of those have you oh yeah those are good
oh my gosh they're so good especially
when they're doing a kitchen a hoarder's
kitchen because you're looking at that
and you're like there's no way there's
no way they can make that look good
there's like dead cockroaches in the
sink there's feces on the ground like
and then by the end of the video you're
like wow I mean yeah the house needs
updating but holy crap how was that even
clean yeah that D that one's that's
amazing number
four tree trimming
particularly hedge trimming like the
trees are whatever but like when you got
those thick bushes those thick bushes
and people just start with those
machine like you're giving someone a
buzz cut it I I don't they're just so
satisfying to see that thing get clean
over time so I'm with you on that but
I'm going to push back a little bit on
the first part the actual trimming are
that is just as good as the Hedge

[25:01]
that is just as good as the Hedge
trimming from an algorithm perspective
because all of the all of these videos
work because of one word retention the
algorithm knows that you want to see
what happens at the end right so with if
you got a guy like 35 feet up in a tree
with a chainsaw and he's strapped in and
he's cut like you got to see where
that's going to land is it goingon to
hit the house is gonna hit the yard is
gonna hit the guy is the guy gonna swing
off it like those videos get tens of
millions of views because people have to
see the end result it's not as visually
satisfying as a hedge but they want to
see the end you articulated it much
better than I could but basically what
I'm doing here is I'm taking the end the
distribution and working backwards
because I think that these are the types
of videos that will have the best
retention and the best and highest
likelihood of you going viral that I
think will then feed into your business
so that's why I picked these ones all
right
painting I don't know if have you seen
like these painters like painting a
house or anybody who does like a mural
inside of a house I know that's a little
bit different than like a commercial

[26:00]
bit different than like a commercial
residential painter but like dude it is
so fascinating cuz like for half of the
video you're just sitting there like
what are they doing what is that that
color there oh my gosh why are they why
do they start up there and then by the
middle of the video you're like I think
I see it and by the end of it obviously
it's amazing but the time laps of
painting are incredible can I add to
that so there's there's a company I
don't know if they're local or
Nationwide but all they do this is all
they do is paint brick houses white and
black you've posted about this I think
yeah yeah yeah like a year ago it was
a throwaway post right I was scraping
the bottom of the barrel what am I going
to post I post and it blew up because I
realized that there is this war going on
in Boomer's Minds about painting brick
because everyone's convinced that if you
paint brick then the brick will like
suffocate and the whole house will
eventually explode like I've looked into
it there's like some pseudo science to
it but like not really and so everyone

[27:00]
it but like not really and so everyone
it is the most polarizing thing ever oh
it looked oh what happened to it looks
so much better oh everything's white now
everything's white and black and then
the other half is like oh that's the
dumbest thing you could ever do that
Brick's gonna fall apart it needs to
breathe the brick has to breathe like so
I think that someone needs to start a
company that does that paints homes and
all they do is short form video that's
how they get all their leads that's it
because it goes viral I've seen viral
short form videos and otally of like
like a DIY page a husband and wife Duo
and like we just painted our house what
do you think and it blows up and they
didn't expect it and I look at the
comments and sure enough the brick has
to breathe it it had to
breathe that's actually a cool side
business that could be a business in
your local area just approaching these
businesses and saying let me film some
content for you and you actually start
doing it for
free like hey let me film some content
for you I'll throw it up if it gets hits
then you pay me if it doesn't
like yeah or or it's just let me film

[28:01]
like yeah or or it's just let me film
you I'm G to keep this this is going to
go to my my account do you mind if I
just put a tripod here and like I'll
give you some of it if you want to use
for your own channel right but they
don't know what your play is all right
so that was painting number five or
number six you'll know this one
Landscaping dude that that video of that
guy on YouTube so satisfying SB mowing I
don't know what it is but like my
favorite is when he gets that little
dirt that's come over on the cement on
the sidewalk you sound like theovon
right now I know I'm trying he's likei
just you know a little overlap right
there on the sidewalk like a little dirt
like a little little crumble like like a
little little mound of clay like that
Louisiana
mud but you know what I'm talking about
where like it you know over time dirt
just like accumulates and like
integrates with your lawn but it
shouldn't have ever been a part of
the sidewalk so you got to go in there

[29:00]
the sidewalk so you got to go in there
and you got to cut it out like oh when
he removes that he gets the shovel going
oh my gosh that that is the most
satisfying part of the shot Barone all
right next one window washing not as
satisfying but but when they get the
little
squeegee and those guys are just like
and they end it and it's clean it's
amazing all right second to last
one gutter cleaning
it's got to be on there gutters get
freaking
disgusting lots of good content with
gutter cleaning and then my personal
favorite at the moment I mentioned it up
front carpet cleaning when you watch
these carpet cleaning videos when they
go into like just a disgusting house and
they get that carpet from like mocha
brown to pearly
white oh my it's so satisfying it's so
satisfying what's the play here what's
the angle
so what I'm saying is if you're a side

[30:00]
so what I'm saying is if you're a side
Hustler and you want to get into
business and you've been thinking you
you know you've been testing the water
you've been thinking oh maybe I want to
do a painting company maybe I want to
buy an hbac company maybe I want to buy
a plumbing you know maybe I want to get
a whatever a sweaty
business I would start here and work
your way back
because I think that marketing brand
awareness are incredibly important
especially as you're starting out you're
not going to have the same budget as
everybody else so you have to do things
that don't scale you have to do the
gorilla marketing tactics and I would
pick one of these 10 to start with now
if you're you know your whole life
you're like my name is Luigi and I'm
just a passionate about a plumbing right
like that's just you it's in your family
it's in your blood cool go be a plumber
but if you're agnostic and you just want
to get into business I would start by
reverse engineering and taking a look at
least these 10 and say okay these are
going to be a good distribution channel
for me which one of these do I think I
can scale up quickly and get business
quickly and then use the distribution
Channel as gasoline on your business
growth how does that look though like if

[31:00]
growth how does that look though like if
you get if these videos get millions of
views how many of them are going to be
in your local area where you can
actually service those
customers well that's the amazing thing
is like there's Google business profile
which is incredibly important when
somebody goes on to Google Maps and they
search for something especially for Home
Services businesses if you can rank high
your business is going to get more leads
that's just the way that it works
because people see you there's higher
trust Etc but on these Google Business
profiles you can post these videos so
it's not just oh YouTube views are going
to fuel this you're also posting things
to the Google business profile that are
eye-catching that people are like oh
that whoa that's an interesting video
right like it just naturally draws them
to your company and it does add it's
weird but it does add like an era of
legitimacy because it's like oh now I've
seen some of his work cool I I like this
guy I'm gonna I'm gonna go out and hire
him so I'm not necessarily saying go
post it to YouTube go viral and then
feed your business I'm saying you're
going to be setting up your Instagram
and your Twitter and your Facebook pages

[32:01]
and your Twitter and your Facebook pages
anyways this is the type of content you
should be
filming posting maybe it's a big hit and
it goes viral like nationally but most
likely it's not going to do that but it
will help you locally close the deal
with many people can I give you an idea
here's another option yes I think you go
find a nationwide franchisor of one of
these Brands and partner with them and
you just start a YouTube channel that
cap leads and you sell those leads to
them potential franchisee leads I think
that's why a lot of these guys that own
a home service business that's very
eye-catching end up just selling a
course because that's the only way
they're able to capture all this traffic
because it's worldwide traffic right so
their main monetization angle kind of
like Johnny Robinson goes from you know
I'm making 20 30 grand a month on my
actual business which is great but I can
make 10 times that by selling a course
because I have all these eyeballs from
people that find it interesting so I
think a different angle to that could be

[33:00]
think a different angle to that could be
capturing all this content and then
selling the leads to that company that
paints houses right or paints brick
houses or to Rolling Suds that sells
pressure washing franchises I think that
could make you a lot more than selling
courses a franchisee lead is worth 10 to
$50,000 done I love it you just up
