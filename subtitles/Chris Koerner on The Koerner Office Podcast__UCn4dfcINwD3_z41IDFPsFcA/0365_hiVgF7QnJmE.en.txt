I have an addiction I'm at this dessert
Shop in Nashville and I can't help but
think how much money does this place
make every day before I give you the
answers I want to tell you about two
brilliant business tactics that this
place has used it's called googoo
clusters one of them is called the sunk
cost valus if you see that computer over
there you can order these custom goooo
clusters you can order these with a
computer but you have no idea how much
they cost until you're already to the
end of the process that's called the
sunk cost valy cuz by the time you see
that these are $17 for one of them
you're like I've already placed my order
there's no point in backing out now
brilliant business tactic much respect
for me for two experiential why can they
charge $17 because if you look over here
you can watch them make your custom
order that's what they're charging a 97%
profit margin for quite brilliant so I
asked them how many of these things do
you selling per day500 a day at $17 a
piece almost 10 grand a day just in
these things 90 plus% profit margin but
how does it taste
