look at this freaking thing right here
new trend alert new trend alert this is
blowing up around the world in two
different concepts this is day eight of
showing you my favorite 2025 business
ideas so follow for more one for kids
take a boring old coffee shop the coffee
might not even be that great and you put
a Sandbox in the middle of it which
encourages kids to encourage their
parents to go to that coffee shop
instead of the other one how much does a
sandbox with remote control toys cost
next to nothing the second concept is
the thing for adults for dads cuz guess
what I'm 37 years old and I would love
to go to the shop and play with remote
control toys I don't drink coffee so you
can watch this video and think oh man
that's a brilliant idea so I need to do
something about that and then never do
anything about it and then in a couple
years you're going to see someone else
do it in your area and you're going to
say oh I had that idea I could have done
that or you can actually do something
about it with this full business plan
