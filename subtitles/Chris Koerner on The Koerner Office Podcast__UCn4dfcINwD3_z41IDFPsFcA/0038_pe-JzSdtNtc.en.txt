back in college I sold used cars for 2
weeks and yes it was as shady as you
could imagine but I did learn one thing
that was genius it was called the silent
walk around I was taught that when a
customer brings their trade in to be
valued I would slowly walk around it
running my finger along each scratch
touching each blemish each Dent
sometimes Going H but never saying a
word as I'm doing this the customer is
silent ly devaluing their own car in
their own head by the time I actually
get to the price they've talked
themselves down two to three grand
