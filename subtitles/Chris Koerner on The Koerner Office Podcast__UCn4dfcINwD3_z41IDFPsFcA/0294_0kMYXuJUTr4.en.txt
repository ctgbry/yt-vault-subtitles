okay so this boggles my mind I'm out
here on a bike ride and I ride past this
Swig location in case you're wondering
Swig is a franchise that sells sugar
water to kids and gives adults type 2
diabetes and I'm thinking of all the
ways to make money some high Net Worth
Texas investor decided to drop $500,000
to $1.1 million to open this location
and they have to open five as required
by the franchisor there are so many ways
to make money out there in the world why
spend $500,000 selling sugar water to
kids why is the menu so big when it
should just say what would you like
today type 2 diabetes hyperactivity or
obesity not to mention there are no cars
in this dang parking lot this is a fad
this is a fad please pick a business
that a doesn't cost this much to start
and B doesn't make people addicted to
something poisonous follow me for more
